<text>MediaWiki is free and open-source wiki software originally developed by Magnus Manske for use on Wikipedia on January 25, 2002, and further improved by Lee Daniel Crocker, after which development has been coordinated by the Wikimedia Foundation. It powers several wiki hosting websites across the Internet, as well as most websites hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation including Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikimedia Commons, Wikiquote, Meta-Wiki and Wikidata, which define a large part of the set requirements for the software. Besides its usage on Wikimedia sites, MediaWiki has been used as a knowledge management and content management system on websites such as Fandom, wikiHow and major internal installations like Intellipedia and Diplopedia.

MediaWiki is written in the PHP programming language and stores all text content into a database. The software is optimized to efficiently handle large projects, which can have terabytes of content and hundreds of thousands of views per second. Because Wikipedia is one of the world&#x27;s largest and most visited websites, achieving scalability through multiple layers of caching and database replication has been a major concern for developers. Another major aspect of MediaWiki is its internationalization; its interface is available in more than 400 languages. The software has hundreds of configuration settings and more than 1,000 extensions available for enabling various features to be added or changed.

==Key features==
MediaWiki provides a rich core feature set and a mechanism to attach extensions to provide additional functionality.

===Internationalization and localisation===
Due to the strong emphasis on multilingualism in the Wikimedia projects, internationalization and localization has received significant attention by developers. The user interface has been fully or partially translated into more than 400 languages on translatewiki.net, and can be further customized by site administrators (the entire interface is editable through the wiki).

Several extensions, most notably those collected in the MediaWiki Language Extension Bundle, are designed to further enhance the multilingualism and internationalization of MediaWiki.

===Installation and configuration===
Installation of MediaWiki requires that the user have administrative privileges on a server running both PHP and a compatible type of SQL database. Some users find that setting up a virtual host is helpful if the majority of one&#x27;s site runs under a framework (such as Zope or Ruby on Rails) that is largely incompatible with MediaWiki. Cloud hosting can eliminate the need to deploy a new server.

An installation PHP script is accessed via a web browser to initialize the wiki&#x27;s settings. It prompts the user for a minimal set of required parameters, leaving further changes, such as enabling uploads, adding a site logo, and installing extensions, to be made by modifying configuration settings contained in a file called codice_1. Some aspects of MediaWiki can be configured through special pages or by editing certain pages; for instance, abuse filters can be configured through a special page, and certain gadgets can be added by creating JavaScript pages in the MediaWiki namespace. The MediaWiki community publishes a comprehensive installation guide.

===Markup===
One of the earliest differences between MediaWiki (and its predecessor, UseModWiki) and other wiki engines was the use of &quot;free links&quot; instead of CamelCase. When MediaWiki was created, it was typical for wikis to require text like &quot;WorldWideWeb&quot; to create a link to a page about the World Wide Web; links in MediaWiki, on the other hand, are created by surrounding words with double square brackets, and any spaces between them are left intact, e.g. codice_2. This change was logical for the purpose of creating an encyclopedia, where accuracy in titles is important.

MediaWiki uses an extensible lightweight wiki markup designed to be easier to use and learn than HTML. Tools exist for converting content such as tables between MediaWiki markup and HTML. Efforts have been made to create a MediaWiki markup spec, but a consensus seems to have been reached that Wikicode requires context-sensitive grammar rules. The following side-by-side comparison illustrates the differences between wiki markup and HTML:


===Editing interface===

MediaWiki&#x27;s default page-editing tools have been described as somewhat challenging to learn. A survey of students assigned to use a MediaWiki-based wiki found that when they were asked an open question about main problems with the wiki, 24% cited technical problems with formatting, e.g. &quot;Couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get an image in. Can&#x27;t figure out how to show a link with words; it inserts a number.&quot;

To make editing long pages easier, MediaWiki allows the editing of a subsection of a page (as identified by its header). A registered user can also indicate whether or not an edit is minor. Correcting spelling, grammar or punctuation are examples of minor edits, whereas adding paragraphs of new text is an example of a non-minor edit.

Sometimes while one user is editing, a second user saves an edit to the same part of the page. Then, when the first user attempts to save the page, an edit conflict occurs. The second user is then given an opportunity to merge their content into the page as it now exists following the first user&#x27;s page save.

MediaWiki&#x27;s user interface has been localized in many different languages. A language for the wiki content itself can also be set, to be sent in the &quot;Content-Language&quot; HTTP header and &quot;lang&quot; HTML attribute.

VisualEditor has its own integrated wikitext editing interface known as 2017 wikitext editor, the older editing interface is known as 2010 wikitext editor.

===Application programming interface===
MediaWiki has an extensible web API (application programming interface) that provides direct, high-level access to the data contained in the MediaWiki databases. Client programs can use the API to log in, get data, and post changes. The API supports thin web-based JavaScript clients and end-user applications (such as vandal-fighting tools). The API can be accessed by the backend of another web site. An extensive Python bot library, , and a popular semi-automated tool called , also interface with the API. The API is accessed via URLs such as codice_3. In this case, the query would be asking Wikipedia for information relating to the last 10 edits to the site. One of the perceived advantages of the API is its language independence; it listens for HTTP connections from clients and can send a response in a variety of formats, such as XML, serialized PHP, or JSON. Client code has been developed to provide layers of abstraction to the API.

===Tracking edits===
Among the features of MediaWiki to assist in tracking edits is a Recent Changes feature that provides a list of recent edits to the wiki. This list contains basic information about those edits such as the editing user, the edit summary, the page edited, as well as any tags (e.g. &quot;possible vandalism&quot;) added by customizable abuse filters and other extensions to aid in combating unhelpful edits. On more active wikis, so many edits occur that it is hard to track Recent Changes manually. Anti-vandal software, including user-assisted tools, is sometimes employed on such wikis to process Recent Changes items. Server load can be reduced by sending a continuous feed of Recent Changes to an IRC channel that these tools can monitor, eliminating their need to send requests for a refreshed Recent Changes feed to the API.

Another important tool is watchlisting. Each logged-in user has a watchlist to which the user can add whatever pages he or she wishes. When an edit is made to one of those pages, a summary of that edit appears on the watchlist the next time it is refreshed. As with the recent changes page, recent edits that appear on the watchlist contain clickable links for easy review of the article history and specific changes made.

There is also the capability to review all edits made by any particular user. In this way, if an edit is identified as problematic, it is possible to check the user&#x27;s other edits for issues.

MediaWiki allows one to link to specific versions of articles. This has been useful to the scientific community, in that expert peer reviewers could analyse articles, improve them and provide links to the trusted version of that article.

===Navigation===

==== Wikilinks ====
Navigation through the wiki is largely through internal wikilinks. MediaWiki&#x27;s wikilinks implement page existence detection, in which a link is colored blue if the target page exists on the local wiki and red if it does not. If a user clicks on a red link, they are prompted to create an article with that title. Page existence detection makes it practical for users to create &quot;wikified&quot; articles—that is, articles containing links to other pertinent subjects—without those other articles being yet in existence.

==== Interwiki links ====

Interwiki links function much the same way as namespaces. A set of interwiki prefixes can be configured to cause, for instance, a page title of codice_4 to direct the user to the Jimbo Wales article on Wikiquote. Unlike internal wikilinks, interwiki links lack page existence detection functionality, and accordingly there is no way to tell whether a blue interwiki link is broken or not.

==== Interlanguage links ====

Interlanguage links are the small navigation links that show up in the sidebar in most MediaWiki skins that connect an article with related articles in other languages within the same Wiki family. This can provide language-specific communities connected by a larger context, with all wikis on the same server or each on its own server.

Previously, Wikipedia used interlanguage links to link an article to other articles on the same topic in other editions of Wikipedia. This was superseded by the launch of Wikidata.

===Content organization===

====Page tabs and associated pages====

Page tabs are displayed at the top of pages. These tabs allow users to perform actions or view pages that are related to the current page. The available default actions include viewing, editing, and discussing the current page. The specific tabs displayed depend on whether the user is logged into the wiki and whether the user has sysop privileges on the wiki. For instance, the ability to move a page or add it to one&#x27;s watchlist is usually restricted to logged-in users. The site administrator can add or remove tabs by using JavaScript or installing extensions.

Each page has an associated history page from which the user can access every version of the page that has ever existed and generate diffs between two versions of his choice. Users&#x27; contributions are displayed not only here, but also via a &quot;user contributions&quot; option on a sidebar. In a 2004 article, Carl Challborn and Teresa Reimann noted that &quot;While this feature may be a slight deviation from the collaborative, &#x27;ego-less&#x27; spirit of wiki purists, it can be very useful for educators who need to assess the contribution and participation of individual student users.&quot;

==== Namespaces ====
MediaWiki provides many features beyond hyperlinks for structuring content. One of the earliest such features is &quot;namespaces&quot;. One of Wikipedia&#x27;s earliest problems had been the separation of encyclopedic content from pages pertaining to maintenance and communal discussion, as well as personal pages about encyclopedia editors. Namespaces are prefixes before a page title (such as &quot;codice_5&quot; or &quot;codice_6&quot;) that serve as descriptors for the page&#x27;s purpose and allow multiple pages with different functions to exist under the same title. For instance, a page titled &quot;codice_2&quot;, in the default namespace, could describe the 1984 movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, while a page titled &quot;codice_2&quot; could be a profile describing a user who chooses this name as a pseudonym. More commonly, each namespace has an associated &quot;codice_6&quot; namespace, which can be used to discuss its contents, such as &quot;codice_10&quot; or &quot;codice_11&quot;. The purpose of having discussion pages is to allow content to be separated from discussion surrounding the content.

Namespaces can be viewed as folders that separate different basic types of information or functionality. Custom namespaces can be added by the site administrators. There are 16 namespaces by default for content, with 2 &quot;pseudo-namespaces&quot; used for dynamically generated &quot;codice_12&quot; pages and links to media files. Each namespace on MediaWiki is numbered: content page namespaces have even numbers and their associated talk page namespaces have odd numbers.

====Category tags====
Users can create new categories and add pages and files to those categories by appending one or more category tags to the content text. Adding these tags creates links at the bottom of the page that take the reader to the list of all pages in that category, making it easy to browse related articles. The use of categorization to organize content has been described as a combination of:
* Collaborative tagging systems like del.icio.us and
* Hierarchical classifications like the Dewey Decimal Classification.

====Subpages====
In addition to namespaces, content can be ordered using &quot;subpages&quot;. This simple feature provides automatic breadcrumbs of the pattern codice_2 from the page after the slash (in this case, &quot;Subpage title&quot;) to the page before the slash (in this case, &quot;Page title&quot;).

===Customization===
If the feature is enabled, users can customize their stylesheets and configure client-side JavaScript to be executed with every pageview. On Wikipedia, this has led to a large number of additional tools and helpers developed through the wiki and shared among users. For instance, &quot;navigation popups&quot; is a custom JavaScript tool that shows previews of articles when the user hovers over links and also provides shortcuts for common maintenance tasks.

The entire MediaWiki user interface can be edited through the wiki itself by users with the necessary permissions (typically called &quot;administrators&quot;). This is done through a special namespace with the prefix &quot;MediaWiki:&quot;, where each page title identifies a particular user interface message. Using an extension, it is also possible for a user to create personal scripts, and to choose whether certain sitewide scripts should apply to them by toggling the appropriate options in the user preferences page.

===Templates===
The &quot;MediaWiki:&quot; namespace was originally also used for creating custom text blocks that could then be dynamically loaded into other pages using a special syntax. This content was later moved into its own namespace, &quot;Template:&quot;.

Templates are text blocks that can be dynamically loaded inside another page whenever that page is requested. The template is a special link in double curly brackets (for example &quot;codice_2&quot;), which calls the template (in this case located at ) to load in place of the template call.

Templates are structured documents containing attribute–value pairs. They are defined with parameters, to which are assigned values when transcluded on an article page. The name of the parameter is delimited from the value by an equals sign. A class of templates known as infoboxes is used on Wikipedia to collect and present a subset of information about its subject, usually on the top (mobile view) or top right-hand corner (desktop view) of the document.

Pages in other namespaces can also be transcluded as templates. In particular, a page in the main namespace can be transcluded by prefixing its title with a colon; for example, codice_15 transcludes the article &quot;MediaWiki&quot; from the main namespace. Also, it is possible to mark the portions of a page that should be transcluded in several ways, the most basic of which are:

* , which marks content that is not to be transcluded;
* , which marks content that is not rendered unless it is transcluded;
* , which marks content that is to be the &quot;only&quot; content transcluded.

A related method, called template &quot;substitution&quot; (called by adding codice_16 at the beginning of a template link) inserts the contents of the template into the target page (like a copy and paste operation), instead of loading the template contents dynamically whenever the page is loaded. This can lead to inconsistency when using templates, but may be useful in certain cases, and in most cases requires fewer server resources (the actual amount of savings can vary depending on wiki configuration and the complexity of the template).

Templates have found many different uses. Templates enable users to create complex table layouts that are used consistently across multiple pages, and where only the content of the tables gets inserted using template parameters. Templates are frequently used to identify problems with a Wikipedia article by putting a template in the article. This template then outputs a graphical box stating that the article content is disputed or in need of some other attention, and also categorize it so that articles of this nature can be located. Templates are also used on user pages to send users standard messages welcoming them to the site, giving them awards for outstanding contributions, warning them when their behavior is considered inappropriate, notifying them when they are blocked from editing, and so on.

===Groups and restriction of access===
MediaWiki offers flexibility in creating and defining user groups. For instance, it would be possible to create an arbitrary &quot;ninja&quot; group that can block users and delete pages, and whose edits are hidden by default in the recent changes log. It is also possible to set up a group of &quot;autoconfirmed&quot; users that one becomes a member of after making a certain number of edits and waiting a certain number of days. Some groups that are enabled by default are bureaucrats and sysops. Bureaucrats have the power to change other users&#x27; rights. Sysops have power over page protection and deletion and the blocking of users from editing. MediaWiki&#x27;s available controls on editing rights have been deemed sufficient for publishing and maintaining important documents such as a manual of standard operating procedures in a hospital.

MediaWiki comes with a basic set of features related to restricting access, but its original and ongoing design is driven by functions that largely relate to content, not content segregation. As a result, with minimal exceptions (related to specific tools and their related &quot;Special&quot; pages), page access control has never been a high priority in core development and developers have stated that users requiring secure user access and authorization controls should not rely on MediaWiki, since it was never designed for these kinds of situations. For instance, it is extremely difficult to create a wiki where only certain users can read and access some pages. Here, wiki engines like Foswiki, MoinMoin and Confluence provide more flexibility by supporting advanced security mechanisms like access control lists.

===Extensibility===
The MediaWiki codebase contains various hooks using callback functions to add additional PHP code in an extensible way. This allows developers to write extensions without necessarily needing to modify the core or having to submit their code for review. Installing an extension typically consists of adding a line to the configuration file, though in some cases additional changes such as database updates or core patches are required.

Five main extension points were created to allow developers to add features and functionalities to MediaWiki. Hooks are run every time a certain event happens; for instance, the codice_17 hook occurs after a save article request has been processed. This can be used, for example, by an extension that notifies selected users whenever a page edit occurs on the wiki from new or anonymous users. New tags can be created to process data with opening and closing tags (codice_18). Parser functions can be used to create a new command (codice_19). New special pages can be created to perform a specific function. These pages are dynamically generated. For example, a special page might show all pages that have one or more links to an external site or it might create a form providing user submitted feedback. Skins allow users to customize the look and feel of MediaWiki. A minor extension point allows the use of Amazon S3 to host image files.

==Extensions==
===Text manipulation===

Among the most popular extensions is a parser function extension, ParserFunctions, which allows different content to be rendered based on the result of conditional statements. These conditional statements can perform functions such as evaluating whether a parameter is empty, comparing strings, evaluating mathematical expressions, and returning one of two values depending on whether a page exists. It was designed as a replacement for a notoriously inefficient template called . Schindler recounts the history of the ParserFunctions extension as follows:
Another parser functions extension, StringFunctions, was developed to allow evaluation of string length, string position, and so on. Wikimedia communities, having created awkward workarounds to accomplish the same functionality, clamored for it to be enabled on their projects. Much of its functionality was eventually integrated into the ParserFunctions extension, albeit disabled by default and accompanied by a warning from Tim Starling that enabling string functions would allow users &quot;to implement their own parsers in the ugliest, most inefficient programming language known to man: MediaWiki wikitext with ParserFunctions.&quot;

Since 2012 an extension, Scribunto, has existed that allows for the creation of &quot;modules&quot;—wiki pages written in the scripting language Lua—which can then be run within templates and standard wiki pages. Scribunto has been installed on Wikipedia and other Wikimedia sites since 2013 and is used heavily on those sites. Scribunto code runs significantly faster than corresponding wikitext code using ParserFunctions.

===For footnotes and academic-related display===
Another very popular extension is a citation extension that enables footnotes to be added to pages using inline references. This extension has, however, been criticized for being difficult to use and requiring the user to memorize complex syntax. A gadget called attempts to make it easier to create citations using common templates. MediaWiki has some extensions that are well-suited for academia, such as mathematics extensions and an extension that allows molecules to be rendered in 3D.

===Integration===
A generic Widgets extension exists that allows MediaWiki to integrate with virtually anything. Other examples of extensions that could improve a wiki are category suggestion extensions and extensions for inclusion of Flash Videos, YouTube videos, and RSS feeds. Metavid, a site that archives video footage of the U.S. Senate and House floor proceedings, was created using code extending MediaWiki into the domain of collaborative video authoring.

===Combating linkspam===
There are many spambots that search the web for MediaWiki installations and add linkspam to them, despite the fact that MediaWiki uses the nofollow attribute to discourage such attempts at search engine optimization. Part of the problem is that third party republishers, such as mirrors, may not independently implement the nofollow tag on their websites, so marketers can still get PageRank benefit by inserting links into pages when those entries appear on third party websites. Anti-spam extensions have been developed to combat the problem by introducing CAPTCHAs, blacklisting certain URLs, and allowing bulk deletion of pages recently added by a particular user.

===Searches and queries===

MediaWiki comes pre-installed with a standard text-based search. Extensions exist to let MediaWiki use more sophisticated third-party search engines, including Elasticsearch (which since 2014 has been in use on Wikipedia), Lucene and Sphinx.

Various MediaWiki extensions have also been created to allow for more complex, faceted search, on both data entered within the wiki and on metadata such as pages&#x27; revision history. Semantic MediaWiki is one such extension.

===Rich content===
Various extensions to MediaWiki support rich content generated through specialized syntax. These include mathematical formulas using LaTeX, graphical timelines over mathematical plotting, musical scores and Egyptian hieroglyphs.

The software supports a wide variety of uploaded media files, and allows image galleries and thumbnails to be generated with relative ease. There is also support for Exif metadata. MediaWiki operates the Wikimedia Commons, one of the largest free content media archives.

For WYSIWYG editing, VisualEditor is available to use in MediaWiki which simplifying editing process for editors and has been bundled since MediaWiki 1.35. Other extensions exist for handling WYSIWYG editing to different degrees.

==Database==
MediaWiki can use either the MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL or SQLite relational database management system. Support for Oracle Database and Microsoft SQL Server has been dropped since MediaWiki 1.34. A MediaWiki database contains several dozen tables, including a codice_20 table that contains page titles, page ids, and other metadata; and a codice_21 table to which is added a new row every time an edit is made, containing the page id, a brief textual summary of the change performed, the user name of the article editor (or its IP address the case of an unregistered user) and a timestamp.

In a 4½ year period prior to 2008, the MediaWiki database had 170 schema versions. Possibly the largest schema change was done in 2005 with MediaWiki 1.5, when the storage of metadata was separated from that of content, to improve performance flexibility. When this upgrade was applied to Wikipedia, the site was locked for editing, and the schema was converted to the new version in about 22 hours. Some software enhancement proposals, such as a proposal to allow sections of articles to be watched via watchlist, have been rejected because the necessary schema changes would have required excessive Wikipedia downtime.

==Performance and storage==
Because it is used to run one of the highest-traffic sites on the Web, Wikipedia, MediaWiki&#x27;s performance and scalability have been highly optimized. MediaWiki supports Squid, load-balanced database replication, client-side caching, memcached or table-based caching for frequently accessed processing of query results, a simple static file cache, feature-reduced operation, revision compression, and a job queue for database operations. MediaWiki developers have attempted to optimize the software by avoiding expensive algorithms, database queries, etc., caching every result that is expensive and has temporal locality of reference, and focusing on the hot spots in the code through profiling.

MediaWiki code is designed to allow for data to be written to a read-write database and read from read-only databases, although the read-write database can be used for some read operations if the read-only databases are not yet up to date. Metadata, such as article revision history, article relations (links, categories etc.), user accounts and settings can be stored in core databases and cached; the actual revision text, being more rarely used, can be stored as append-only blobs in external storage. The software is suitable for the operation of large-scale wiki farms such as Wikimedia, which had about 800 wikis as of August 2011. However, MediaWiki comes with no built-in GUI to manage such installations.

Empirical evidence shows most revisions in MediaWiki databases tend to differ only slightly from previous revisions. Therefore, subsequent revisions of an article can be concatenated and then compressed, achieving very high data compression ratios of up to 100x.

For more information on the architecture, such as how it stores wikitext and assembles a page, see &quot;External links&quot;.

==Limitations==
The parser serves as the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for the MediaWiki syntax, as no formal syntax has been defined. Due to this lack of a formal definition, it has been difficult to create WYSIWYG editors for MediaWiki, although several WYSIWYG extensions do exist, including the popular VisualEditor.

MediaWiki is not designed to be a suitable replacement for dedicated online forum or blogging software, although extensions do exist to allow for both of these.

It is common for new MediaWiki users to make certain mistakes, such as forgetting to sign posts with four tildes (~~~~), or manually entering a plaintext signature, due to unfamiliarity with the idiosyncratic particulars involved in communication on MediaWiki discussion pages. On the other hand, the format of these discussion pages has been cited as a strength by one educator, who stated that it provides more fine-grain capabilities for discussion than traditional threaded discussion forums. For example, instead of &#x27;replying&#x27; to an entire message, the participant in a discussion can create a hyperlink to a new wiki page on any word from the original page. Discussions are easier to follow since the content is available via hyperlinked wiki page, rather than a series of reply messages on a traditional threaded discussion forum. However, except in few cases, students were not using this capability, possibly because of their familiarity with the traditional linear discussion style and a lack of guidance on how to make the content more &#x27;link-rich&#x27;.

MediaWiki by default has little support for the creation of dynamically assembled documents, or pages that aggregate data from other pages. Some research has been done on enabling such features directly within MediaWiki. The Semantic MediaWiki extension provides these features. It is not in use on Wikipedia, but in more than 1,600 other MediaWiki installations. The Wikibase Repository and Wikibase Repository client are however implemented in Wikidata and Wikipedia respectively, and to some extent provides semantic web features, and linking of centrally stored data to infoboxes in various Wikipedia articles.

Upgrading MediaWiki is usually fully automated, requiring no changes to the site content or template programming. Historically troubles have been encountered when upgrading from significantly older versions.

==Security==
MediaWiki developers have enacted security standards, both for core code and extensions. SQL queries and HTML output are usually done through wrapper functions that handle validation, escaping, filtering for prevention of cross-site scripting and SQL injection. Many security issues have had to be patched after a MediaWiki version release, and accordingly MediaWiki.org states, &quot;The most important security step you can take is to keep your software up to date&quot; by subscribing to the announcement mailing list and installing security updates that are announced.

==Support==
Support for MediaWiki users consists of:
* MediaWiki.org, including the Support Desk.
* An official mailing list, Mediawiki-l.
* Several books have been written about MediaWiki administration, including some free online books.

==License==
MediaWiki is free and open-source and is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 or any later version. Its documentation, located at its official website at www.mediawiki.org, is released under the Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 license, with a set of help pages intended to be freely copied into fresh wiki installations and/or distributed with MediaWiki software in the public domain instead to eliminate legal issues for wikis with other licenses. MediaWiki&#x27;s development has generally favored the use of open-source media formats.

==Development==
MediaWiki has an active volunteer community for development and maintenance. MediaWiki developers are spread around the world, though with a majority in the United States and Europe. Face-to-face meetings and programming sessions for MediaWiki developers have been held once or several times a year since 2004.

Anyone can submit patches to the project&#x27;s Git/Gerrit repository.
There are also paid programmers who primarily develop projects for the Wikimedia Foundation. MediaWiki developers participate in the Google Summer of Code by facilitating the assignment of mentors to students wishing to work on MediaWiki core and extension projects.
During the year prior to November 2012, there were about two hundred developers who had committed changes to the MediaWiki core or extensions.
Major MediaWiki releases are generated approximately every six months by taking snapshots of the development branch, which is kept continuously in a runnable state; minor releases, or point releases, are issued as needed to correct bugs (especially security problems).
MediaWiki is developed on a continuous integration development model, in which software changes are pushed live to Wikimedia sites on regular basis.
MediaWiki also has a public bug tracker, &quot;phabricator.wikimedia.org&quot;, which runs Phabricator. The site is also used for feature and enhancement requests.

==History==

When Wikipedia was launched in January 2001, it ran on an existing wiki software system, UseModWiki. UseModWiki is written in the Perl programming language, and stores all wiki pages in text (.txt) files. This software soon proved to be limiting, in both functionality and performance. In mid-2001, Magnus Manske—a developer and student at the University of Cologne, as well as a Wikipedia editor—began working on new software that would replace UseModWiki, specifically designed for use by Wikipedia. This software was written in the PHP scripting language, and stored all of its information in a MySQL database. The new software was largely developed by August 24, 2001, and a test wiki for it was established shortly thereafter.

The first full implementation of this software was the new Meta Wikipedia on November 9, 2001. There was a desire to have it implemented immediately on the English-language Wikipedia. However, Manske was apprehensive about any potential bugs harming the nascent website during the period of the final exams he had to complete immediately prior to Christmas; this led to the launch on the English-language Wikipedia being delayed until January 25, 2002. The software was then, gradually, deployed on all the Wikipedia language sites of that time. This software was referred to as &quot;the PHP script&quot; and as &quot;phase II&quot;, with the name &quot;phase I&quot;, retroactively given to the use of UseModWiki.

Increasing usage soon caused load problems to arise again, and soon after, another rewrite of the software began; this time being done by Lee Daniel Crocker, which became known as &quot;phase III&quot;. This new software was also written in PHP, with a MySQL backend, and kept the basic interface of the phase II software, but with the added functionality of a wider scalability. The &quot;phase III&quot; software went live on Wikipedia in July 2002.

The Wikimedia Foundation was announced on June 20, 2003. In July, Wikipedia contributor Daniel Mayer suggested the name &quot;MediaWiki&quot; for the software, as a play on &quot;Wikimedia&quot;. The MediaWiki name was gradually phased in, beginning in August 2003. The name has frequently caused confusion due to its (intentional) similarity to the &quot;Wikimedia&quot; name (which itself is similar to &quot;Wikipedia&quot;). The first version of MediaWiki, 1.1, was released in December 2003.
The old product logo was created by Erik Möller, using a flower photograph taken by Florence Nibart-Devouard, and was originally submitted to the logo contest for a new , held from July 20 to August 27, 2003. The logo came in third place, and was chosen to represent MediaWiki rather than Wikipedia, with the second place logo being used for the Wikimedia Foundation. The double square brackets ( ) symbolize the syntax MediaWiki uses for creating hyperlinks to other wiki pages; while the sunflower represents the diversity of content on Wikipedia, its constant growth, and the wilderness.

Later, , the chief technical officer of the Wikimedia Foundation, took up the role of release manager.

Major milestones in MediaWiki&#x27;s development have included: the categorization system (2004); parser functions, (2006); Flagged Revisions, (2008); the &quot;ResourceLoader&quot;, a delivery system for CSS and JavaScript (2011); and the VisualEditor, a &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; (WYSIWYG) editing platform (2013).

The contest of designing a new logo was initiated on June 22, 2020, as the old logo was a bitmap image and had &quot;high details&quot;, leading to problems when rendering at high and low resolutions, respectively. After two rounds of voting, the new and current MediaWiki logo designed by Serhio Magpie was selected on October 24, 2020, and officially adopted on April 1, 2021.

==Sites using MediaWiki==
MediaWiki&#x27;s most famous use has been in Wikipedia and, to a lesser degree, the Wikimedia Foundation&#x27;s other projects. Fandom, a wiki hosting service formerly known as Wikia, runs on MediaWiki. Other public wikis that run on MediaWiki include wikiHow and SNPedia. WikiLeaks began as a MediaWiki-based site, but is no longer a wiki.

A number of alternative wiki encyclopedias to Wikipedia run on MediaWiki, including Citizendium, Metapedia, Scholarpedia and Conservapedia. MediaWiki is also used internally by a large number of companies, including Novell and Intel.

Notable usages of MediaWiki within governments include Intellipedia, used by the United States Intelligence Community, Diplopedia, used by the United States Department of State, and milWiki, a part of milSuite used by the United States Department of Defense. United Nations agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme and INSTRAW chose to implement their wikis using MediaWiki, because &quot;this software runs Wikipedia and is therefore guaranteed to be thoroughly tested, will continue to be developed well into the future, and future technicians on these wikis will be more likely to have exposure to MediaWiki than any other wiki software.&quot;

The Free Software Foundation uses MediaWiki to implement the LibrePlanet site.

==Comparison to other online collaboration software==
Users of online collaboration software are familiar with MediaWiki&#x27;s functions and layout due to its noted use on Wikipedia. A 2006 overview of social software in academia observed that &quot;Compared to other wikis, MediaWiki is also fairly aesthetically pleasing, though simple, and has an easily customized side menu and stylesheet.&quot; However, in one assessment in 2006, Confluence was deemed to be a superior product due to its very usable API and ability to better support multiple wikis.

A 2009 study at the University of Hong Kong compared TWiki to MediaWiki. The authors noted that TWiki has been considered as a collaborative tool for the development of educational papers and technical projects, whereas MediaWiki&#x27;s most noted use is on Wikipedia. Although both platforms allow discussion and tracking of progress, TWiki has a &quot;Report&quot; part that MediaWiki lacks. Students perceived MediaWiki as being easier to use and more enjoyable than TWiki. When asked whether they recommended using MediaWiki for knowledge management course group project, 15 out of 16 respondents expressed their preference for MediaWiki giving answers of great certainty, such as &quot;of course&quot;, &quot;for sure&quot;. TWiki and MediaWiki both have flexible plug-in architecture.

A 2009 study that compared students&#x27; experience with MediaWiki to that with Google Docs found that students gave the latter a much higher rating on user-friendly layout.

A 2021 study conducted by the Brazilian Nuclear Engineering Institute compared a MediaWiki-based knowledge management system against two others that were based on DSpace and Open Journal Systems, respectively. It highlighted ease of use as an advantage of the MediaWiki-based system, noting that because the Wikimedia Foundation had been developing MediaWiki for a site aimed at the general public (Wikipedia), &quot;its user interface was designed to be more user-friendly from start, and has received large user feedback over a long time&quot;, in contrast to DSpace&#x27;s and OJS&#x27;s focus on niche audiences.

<doc id="323712" wikidata="Q48765523" url="?curid=323712" title="Async (album)">
<text>async is the nineteenth solo studio album of Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto and his first one in eight years since &quot;Out of Noise&quot; (2009). It is also his first full-length solo record since recovering from throat cancer in 2015. Consisting of a combination of unusual interpretations of familiar musical instruments, textures both acoustic and electronically made, samples of recordings of people such as David Sylvian and Paul Bowles doing readings, and everyday sounds borrowed from field recordings of city streets, &quot;async&quot; has underlying themes of the worries of the end of life and the interaction of differing viewpoints in humanity.

Promoted with two art museum installations, a short film contest, and premiering via a listening event at Big Ears Festival, &quot;async&quot; was first released in Japan by Sakamoto&#x27;s label Commmons in March 2017 before Milan distributed it to other nations in April 2017. It was critically acclaimed, landed in the top twenty of the Japanese albums chart and in the top five of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s American Top Classical Albums chart, and was ranked the best album of 2017 by &quot;Fact&quot; magazine. A set of remixes of songs from &quot;async&quot;, titled &quot;ASYNC – REMODELS&quot;, was released in December 2017.

==Background==
Since 2009, Ryuichi Sakamoto had an eight-year period where he was unable to inspire himself in his composition process. As a result, he focused most of his time on scoring films instead of producing solo material. He started sketching ideas for a solo album in 2014, but they were scrapped after he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014, after which he had to pause his career entirely. Despite recovering from the disease in August 2015, Sakamoto thought &quot;async&quot; would be his last album: &quot;That’s why I tried to forget all the rules and forms, anything. I just wanted to put down just what I wanted to hear, just a sound or music, it doesn’t matter. This could be the last time.&quot; He began making it entirely from scratch in April 2016, which was after completing his soundtrack for the film &quot;Rage&quot; (2016), and finished it in eight months. The only track made before Sakamoto&#x27;s cancer diagnosis that appears on &quot;async&quot; is &quot;andata.&quot;

==Sounds and underlying themes==
Inspired by the minimal structures of the works of Claude Debussy and the free jazz stylings of John Coltrane, &quot;async&quot;, as Milan Records summarized, is a set of representations of Sakamoto&#x27;s thinking that &quot;plays with ideas of a-synchronism, prime numbers, chaos, quantum physics and the blurred lines of life and artificiality/noise and music.&quot; Sakamoto conceived the album as the soundtrack for a nonexistent movie by Andrei Tarkovsky, whose works mostly deal with mortality (see the Worries of death subsection of this article) and employed walking scenes with the type of Foley featured on &quot;async&quot;.

When making &quot;async&quot;, &quot;I just wanted to hear sounds of things, everyday things, even the sounds of instruments, musical instruments as things,&quot; Sakamoto said. Sakamoto cited the works of sound art sculptor Harry Bertoia as a major influence when making the album. The instrumentation includes both regular orchestral instruments and unusual acoustic and programmed textures, more specifically bizarre interpretations of otherwise familiar instruments and the &quot;musical aspect[s]&quot; of everyday noise. &quot;async&quot; employs a variety of sound-producing techniques, such as field recordings, making mist textures out of chorales, and wailing sounds from glass. Some of the tracks include out-of-tune pianos; he recorded two Steinway pianos he had in his home studio, and a piano that was drowned in tsunami water was used on the track &quot;Zure.&quot; He thought it was &quot;nature&quot; that was responsible for the notes the broken pianos played: &quot;the piano is a very systematically, industrially-designed thing, but they were a part of nature, taken from nature. Mankind artificially tuned and set the well-tempered scale, but the thing is if you leave the piano for a long time without a tuning, it will be out of tune.&quot;

&quot;Tri&quot; is an unedited recording of triangles performed by three musicians: Ian Antonio, Levy Lorenzo, and Ross Karre. In a 2017 conversation with Sakamoto, Ruth Saxelby assumed the triangle sounds that were in the later part of the track were digitally programmed. However, Sakamoto corrected Saxelby by saying &quot;Tri&quot; went through more than ten takes because the three musicians were &quot;perfectionists&quot; and thus wanted the triangles to sound machine-like.

===Asynchronization and human duality===
As Sakamoto described the album&#x27;s main idea, Sakamoto said it was human nature most people &quot;find pleasure in being in sync. That&#x27;s why I wanted to create untraditional music that doesn&#x27;t synchronize[, because it&#x27;s like] speaking in a language that doesn&#x27;t exist.&quot; He wanted to make a record like this for a long time, but it was difficult to do because he &quot;wanted to make something async but still musical.&quot;

According to Sakamoto, his musical interests were moving towards &quot;sound and music&quot; rather than just &quot;music&quot; while producing the album, and thus he incorporated field recordings to capture &quot;lots of strange sounds.&quot; Sakamoto did the field recordings by walking through streets in New York City, Tokyo, Kyoto, and Paris with a cell phone microphone in his hand, activity that made up for four months of the album&#x27;s production. The sounds he captured were those all people unavoidably encounter in everyday life, such as street noise, animal sounds, leaves, water, and rain. Composing the score for &quot;The Revenant&quot; (2015), a film very heavy on themes about nature in both its story and music, influenced how Sakamoto produced &quot;async&quot;. For &quot;Walker,&quot; Sakamoto spent around ten to fifteen minutes recording his footsteps while walking in a forest filled with leaves, which makes up most of the track. It was a forest that surrounded Philip Johnson&#x27;s Glass House, which Sakamoto later used to record the improvisational piece &quot;Glass&quot; with Alva Noto.

On &quot;async&quot;, all of its sounds come together but never create a proper harmony. However, Sakamoto described these sounds as &quot;significant in their own way because their &quot;existence has meaning.&quot; He explained, &quot;As human beings, we [...] take the liberty to decide which sound is good or bad. [...] I&#x27;m suggesting we open our ears and listen to each sound without prejudice.&quot; Sakamoto did this to symbolize as well as commentate on how the differing viewpoints of humanity worked: &quot;In this world of myriad viewpoints and unlimited information, every single person is choosing only the information that he or she is interested in, and people with similar interests gather and form a group. Then, groups with similar interests exchange views with one another, accelerating the movement to narrow the conversation down to ever-more specific views bound by a particular concern. And so, groups with different interests barely communicate with each other, or even if they do, they tend to dismiss the views of the other.&quot; The message of &quot;async&quot; is that, like dissonant sounds coming together to create music, humans of all different viewpoints should come together and respect each other.

This theme of &quot;async&quot; was compared by writer Karl Smith to the works of Shane Carruth, whose films also deal with chaos in human nature. He used &quot;Zure&quot;&#x27;s mixture of &quot;intangible synthetic panes with the more earthly, percussive tones of the piano&quot; and &quot;Walker&quot;&#x27;s combination of noises with a &quot;call and response [of] gentle swells and vibrations&quot; as examples of the record&#x27;s use of juxtapositions, which present &quot;the idea that any one thing is more than just that one thing.&quot; While a majority of &quot;async&quot; consists of subdued pieces, the album also contains more dissonant tracks like &quot;Tri,&quot; &quot;disintegration,&quot; which places awkwardly-tuned piano plucks aside warm synthesizer pads, and the title track, which includes harshly plucked pizzicato strings. This is to symbolize a &quot;never ending pendulum swing between solace and chaos,&quot; &quot;Paste&quot; magazine stated.

===Worries of death===
Some critics noted Sakamoto&#x27;s worries about death seeping into the album, which were influenced not only by his experience with cancer but also the many earthquakes and tsunamis that occurred in Japan in 2011. He said in an interview, &quot;We were warned about how our civilization is fragile and how the force of nature is great.&quot; David Sylvian, who reads a poem by Arseny Tarkovsky on the song &quot;Life, Life&quot; over pizzicato strings, synthesizers, and a shō, said &quot;async&quot; &quot;expresses a love and gratitude for life accompanied by the knowledge of its fragility.&quot; On &quot;Life, Life,&quot; Sylvian reads, &quot;To one side from ourselves, to one side from the world / Wave follows wave to break on the shore, / On each wave is a star, a person, a bird, / Dreams, reality, death - on wave after wave.&quot; The recording was done in 2011 and was one of ten poem readings Sylvian submitted to Sakamoto for a charity concert supporting victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

&quot;Fullmoon&quot; begins with a quote from Paul Bowles reading his novel &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; (1949) over a sine wave: &quot;We get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number, really.&quot; He also says on the song, &quot;Because we don’t know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps 20. And yet it all seems limitless.&quot; The later part of the song depicts Bowles&#x27; quote being spoken in other languages by Sakamoto&#x27;s friends over an instrumental of piano and synthesizers.

The recording of Bowles saying the quote also appears in the end of the 1990 film adaptation of the book, which Sakamoto composed the score for. Sakamoto explained the sample &quot;struck me so much&quot; when he first listened to it, reasoning that it was &quot;so heavy and serious about life and death, and that excerpt [plays in the film] right after the husband dies in the middle of the Sahara, in the middle of nowhere.&quot; He used the recording for Bowles&#x27; voice, as it &quot;sounds something very profound to me: it&#x27;s not too dark, it&#x27;s very light; it doesn&#x27;t sound too serious.&quot; Bernardo Bertolucci, who wrote and directed the film adaptation, speaks the Italian version of the quote on the track.

==Release==
&quot;async&quot; premiered via a listening event at Big Ears Festival that ran from March 23 to 26, 2017, where the album was presented in 5.1 surround sound. Commmons first released &quot;async&quot; in Japan on CD and in digital stores on March 29, 2017. The vinyl version of the album was also initially planned to come out in the country the same day, but due to sound quality issues was postponed to May 17. &quot;Thump&quot; premiered &quot;async&quot; worldwide via streaming on April 24, 2017, before Milan Records issued it to other formats on April 28, 2017.

==Promotion==
From April 4 to May 28, 2017, the Watari Museum of Contemporary Art ran an exhibition titled &quot;async&quot;, which consists of visuals by artists Shiro Takatani (who was also responsible for the cover art of the album), Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Neo Sora and Albert &quot;Zakkubalan&quot; Tholen performed over cuts from the album. The exhibition&#x27;s moving visuals consisted of distorted footage of a crowd of people and Sakamoto&#x27;s home and studio. A follow-up to the installation, titled &quot;IS YOUR TIME&quot;, ran from December 9, 2017, to March 11, 2018, at NTT InterCommunication Center, and also featured music from &quot;async&quot; and visuals by Takatani.

The first live performance of &quot;async&quot; in the United States was held in the Veterans Room at the Seventh Regiment Armory in the Upper East Side of New York City on April 26, 2017. A concert film of the performance titled &quot;Ryuichi Sakamoto PERFORMANCE IN NEW YORK: async&quot; premiered in Japanese theaters on January 27, 2018. From August 4 until September 30, 2017, submissions were open for a contest ran by Sakamoto and Weerasethakul titled the async Short Film Competition, where filmmakers had to produce a film using music from &quot;async&quot;. From the approximately 800 entries that were submitted, &quot;In a Happy Place&quot; by Sikkim-based filmmaker Sandup Lepcha won the contest, receiving $3,000 and an opportunity to have Sakamoto compose for his next film.

==Critical reception==

&quot;async&quot; garnered very positive reviews from writers upon its release. &quot;Mixmag&quot; gave &quot;async&quot; a ten-out-of-ten review, describing it as &quot;full of church organs, hazy reverb, rippling synths and poetry about mortality and eternity, as well as Sakamoto’s distinctive piano, sonar bleeps and unforgettable melodies. It’s arguably the most beautiful record you’ll hear this year.&quot; &quot;Lotus Land&quot; praised &quot;async&quot; as &quot;yet another entry in his oeuvre which simultaneously feels unique from his other releases and yet inescapably Sakamoto in its depth and emotion.&quot; Kevin Press of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; called it &quot;challenging and moving,&quot; highlighting its &quot;unique ability to create genuine beauty with a varied — at times abrasive — palette&quot; and the fact that Sakamoto &quot;remains a radical after all these years.&quot; As Paul Bowler summarized &quot;async&quot;, &quot;Understandably ruminative in nature, it’s a renewed sense of creative vigour which provides the driving force on a piece of work which stands among the composer’s best.&quot;

Avant-garde music magazine &quot;The Wire&quot; claimed, &quot;its coherence of tonality and timbre gives it the feel of an imaginary soundtrack and yet each track has its own internal logic and direction which means that it never sounds like a grab-bag of musical supervisor’s cues but like a proper album of songs.&quot; Journalist Andy Beta analyzed the album has a &quot;warmth and fragility&quot; that sets it apart from most experimental records. Andrew Ryce praised it for feeling &quot;universal,&quot; where &quot;anyone can pick up the objects around them and make music, and Sakamoto shows how engaging even the simplest exercises in sound can be.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;&#x27;s Sean O&#x27;Neal wrote that when hearing all the songs in order, they &quot;creat[e] a transcendent introspective mood that allows the listener to hear their own story within them,&quot; but when the songs are heard separately, they &quot;can be a bit boring.&quot;

Some critics spotlighted the use of elements of Sakamoto&#x27;s previous works, Ryce calling them the best parts of &quot;async&quot;. &quot;Spectrum Culture&quot; compared it to the composer&#x27;s earlier albums in that &quot;it sacrifices coherency and consistency in getting as many of its creator’s ideas on wax as possible. Some of the ideas here are great, some are bad, most are interesting.&quot; The spoken word pieces garnered mixed opinions. Some found them to be the album&#x27;s weakest tracks, finding them showy ways of presenting themes the album&#x27;s other tracks did more effectively, James Hadfield of &quot;The Japan Times&quot; opined &quot;the vocals sit uncomfortably in the mix.&quot; However, Beta called them &quot;striking inclusion[s],&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Chris Ingalls felt they added &quot;more layers of sonic curiosities,&quot; and Bowler described them as the album&#x27;s &quot;most oddly affecting&quot; moments.

==Release history==
==Charts==
==Remix album==
On December 13, 2017, Commons released &quot;ASYNC – REMODELS&quot;, a collection of remixes of tracks from &quot;async&quot; by musicians such as Oneohtrix Point Never, Johann Johannsson, and Arca. The album landed at number 15 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s United States Classical Albums chart.

== Legacy ==
A reinterpretation of async, &quot;async - immersion 2023&quot; was released on February 2, 2024. This project, a collaboration with Shiro Takatani, was initially presented as a site-specific installation in the basement of the Kyoto Shimbun Building. The release aims to replicate the auditory experience of the &#x27;async - immersion 2023&#x27; exhibit showcased at AMBIENT KYOTO. Designed to be experienced asynchronously, the project diverges from traditional synchronization of sound and image reflecting Sakamoto&#x27;s in an immersive experience.

<text>Troy is a 2004 epic historical war film directed by Wolfgang Petersen and written by David Benioff. Produced by units in Malta, Mexico and Britain&#x27;s Shepperton Studios, the film features an ensemble cast led by Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Sean Bean, Diane Kruger, Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, Rose Byrne, Saffron Burrows and Orlando Bloom. It is loosely based on Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; in its narration of the entire story of the decade-long Trojan War—condensed into little more than a couple of weeks, rather than just the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon in the ninth year. Achilles leads his Myrmidons along with the rest of the Greek army invading the historical city of Troy, defended by Hector&#x27;s Trojan army. The end of the film (the sack of Troy) is not taken from the &quot;Iliad&quot;, but rather from Quintus Smyrnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Posthomerica&quot;, as the &quot;Iliad&quot; concludes with Hector&#x27;s death and funeral.

&quot;Troy&quot; made over $497 million worldwide, making it the 60th highest-grossing film at the time of its release. However, it received mixed reviews, with critics praising its entertainment value and the performances of Pitt and Bana while criticizing its story, which was deemed unfaithful to the &quot;Iliad&quot;. It received a nomination for Best Costume Design at the 77th Academy Awards and was the eighth highest-grossing film of 2004.

==Plot==

In 1184 BC, King Agamemnon unites the Greek kingdoms. Achilles, a heroic warrior, fights for Agamemnon but despises his tyrannical rule. Meanwhile, Prince Hector of Troy and his brother Paris negotiate a peace treaty with Menelaus, King of Sparta. Paris begins an affair with Menelaus&#x27; wife, Queen Helen, and he smuggles her aboard his home-bound vessel. Angered, Menelaus meets Agamemnon, his elder brother, and asks him to help take Troy. Agamemnon agrees, as conquering Troy would give him control of the Aegean Sea. Agamemnon sends Odysseus, King of Ithaca, to persuade Achilles to join them. Initially reluctant, Achilles’ seeks out his mother Thetis who tells him that if he goes to Troy, he will achieve eternal glory, but he will never return home. However, if he stays, he will live a long life, but his name will be forgotten.

In Troy, King Priam welcomes Helen when Hector and Paris return home, and decides to prepare for war. The Greeks eventually invade and take the Trojan beach, thanks largely to Achilles and his Myrmidons. Achilles has the temple of Apollo sacked, and claims Briseis — a priestess and the cousin of Paris and Hector — as a prisoner. He is angered when Agamemnon spitefully takes her from him, and decides that he will not aid Agamemnon in the siege.

Meanwhile, the Trojans assemble their entire army of 25,000 men and discuss what to do about the Greek invasion. General Glaucus puts his confidence in Troy&#x27;s army and the strength of their walls while others argue for diplomacy, prompting Paris to declare he will challenge Menelaus for the right to Helen.

The Trojan and Greek armies meet outside of Troy. During a parley, Paris offers to personally duel Menelaus in exchange for Helen and the city being spared. Agamemnon, intending to take the city regardless, accepts. Menelaus wounds Paris and almost kills him, but is himself killed by Hector, violating the duel. An enraged Agamemnon orders the Greeks to crush the outnumbered Trojan army. In the ensuing battle, Hector kills Ajax in single combat and the Greek army suffers thousands of casualties due to Troy&#x27;s battle hardened army, forcing Agamemnon to retreat. He gives Briseis to the Greek soldiers for their amusement, but Achilles saves her. Later that night, Briseis sneaks into Achilles&#x27; quarters to kill him; instead, she falls for him and they become lovers. Achilles then resolves to leave Troy, much to the dismay of Patroclus, his cousin and protégé.

Despite Hector&#x27;s objections, Priam orders him to attack the Greeks. In battle, Hector duels a man he believes to be Achilles and kills him, only to discover it was actually Patroclus. Distraught, both armies agree to stop fighting for the day. Achilles is informed of his cousin&#x27;s death and vows revenge. Wary of Achilles, Hector shows his wife Andromache a secret tunnel beneath Troy. Should he die and the city fall, he instructs her to take their child and any survivors out of the city to Mount Ida.

The next day, Achilles arrives outside Troy and challenges Hector. The two duel until Hector is killed, and Achilles drags his corpse back to the Trojan beach. Priam sneaks into the camp and implores Achilles to return Hector&#x27;s body for a proper funeral. Ashamed of his actions, Achilles agrees and allows Briseis to return to Troy with Priam, promising a twelve day truce so that Hector&#x27;s funeral rites may be held in peace. He also orders his men to return home without him.

Agamemnon declares that he will take Troy regardless of the cost. Concerned, Odysseus concocts a plan to infiltrate the city: he has the Greeks build a gigantic wooden horse as a peace offering and abandon the Trojan beach, hiding their ships in a nearby cove. Priam orders the horse be brought into the city. That night, Greeks hiding inside the horse emerge and open the city gates for the Greek army, commencing the Sack of Troy. The warriors of Troy attempt to defend their city but are overwhelmed and massacred, while most of the population is killed or enslaved.

While the lower city is being sacked, Andromache and Helen guide survivors to safety through the tunnel, with Paris giving the Sword of Troy to Aeneas, instructing him to protect the Trojans and find them a new home. As the Greek army penetrates the palace walls, Glaucus leads the remaining Trojan soldiers in a brave last stand. The Trojans resist bravely but they are ultimately massacred. Agamemnon enters the palace, kills Priam, and captures Briseis, who then kills him in turn. Achilles fights his way through the city and reunites with Briseis. Paris, seeking to avenge his brother, shoots an arrow through Achilles&#x27; heel and then several into his body. Achilles bids farewell to Briseis, and watches her flee with Paris before dying, having removed all the arrows but the one through his heel.

In the aftermath, a funeral is held for Achilles, where Odysseus cremates his body.

==Cast==

==Production==
The city of Troy was built on the Mediterranean island of Malta at Fort Ricasoli from April to June 2003. Other important scenes were shot in Mellieħa, a small town in the north of Malta, and on the small island of Comino. The outer walls of Troy were built and filmed in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Film production was disrupted for a period after Hurricane Marty affected filming areas. Pitt also suffered an injury to his Achilles tendon during filming which caused the production to delay for several weeks.

The role of Briseis was initially offered to Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai, but she turned it down because she was not comfortable doing the lovemaking scenes that were included. The role eventually went to Rose Byrne.

==Music==

Composer Gabriel Yared originally worked on the score for &quot;Troy&quot; for over a year, having been hired by the director, Wolfgang Petersen. Tanja Carovska provided vocals on various portions of the music, as she later would on composer James Horner&#x27;s version of the soundtrack. However, the reactions at test screenings which used an incomplete version of the score were negative, and in less than a day Yared was off the project without a chance to fix or change his music. James Horner composed a replacement score in about four weeks. He used Carovska&#x27;s vocals again and also included traditional Eastern Mediterranean music and brass instruments. Horner also collaborated with American singer-songwriter Josh Groban and lyricist Cynthia Weil to write an original song for the film&#x27;s end credits. The product of this collaboration, &quot;Remember Me&quot;, was performed by Groban with additional vocals by Carovska.

The soundtrack for the film was released on May 11, 2004, through Reprise Records.

==Director&#x27;s cut==

&quot;Troy: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, also known as the &quot;2007 Version&quot; (according to the end credits), was screened at the 57th Berlin International Film Festival on February 17, 2007, and received a limited release in Germany in April 2007. Warner Home Video reportedly spent more than $1 million for the director&#x27;s cut, which includes &quot;at least 1,000 new cuts&quot; or almost 30 minutes of extra footage (with a new running time of 196 minutes). The DVD was released on September 18, 2007, in the US. The score of the film was changed dramatically, with many of the female vocals being cut. An addition to the music is the use of Danny Elfman&#x27;s theme for &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; during the pivotal fight between Hector and Achilles in front of the Gates of Troy. Josh Groban&#x27;s song was removed from the end credits as well.

Various shots were recut and extended. For instance, the love scene between Helen and Paris was reframed to include more nudity of Diane Kruger. The love scene between Achilles and Briseis is also extended. Only one scene was removed: the scene where Helen tends to the wound of Paris is taken out. The battle scenes were also extended, depicting more violence and gore, including much more of Ajax&#x27;s bloody rampage on the Trojans during the initial attack by the Greek army and his duel with Hector. Perhaps most significant was the sack of Troy, barely present in the theatrical cut, but shown more fully here, depicting the Greek soldiers raping women and massacring the soldiers of Troy. Characters were provided more time to develop, specifically Priam and Odysseus, the latter being given a humorous introduction scene. More emphasis is given to the internal conflict in Troy between the priests, who believe in omens and signs from the gods to determine the outcome of the war, and military commanders, who believe in practical battle strategies to achieve victory, mainly between Trevor Eve and James Cosmo. Lastly, bookend scenes were added: the beginning being a soldier&#x27;s dog finding its dead master and the end including a sequence where the few surviving Trojans escape to Mount Ida.

There are frequent differences between the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Troy&quot;, most notably relating to the final fates of Paris, Helen, Agamemnon, Achilles and Menelaus. In one of the commentary sequences, the film&#x27;s writer, David Benioff, said that when it came to deciding whether to follow the &quot;Iliad&quot; or to do what was best for the film, they always did what seemed best for the film. &quot;I think there are maybe two or three lines in the script that quote Homer,&quot; Benioff says. &quot;Any more than that wouldn&#x27;t have been possible.&quot;

== Home media ==
&quot;Troy&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on January 4, 2005. The &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; was released on Blu-ray, HD DVD, and DVD on September 18, 2007. The &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; is the only edition of the film available on Blu-ray globally. However, there is a Czech Blu-ray release of the theatrical cut.

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
&quot;Troy&quot; grossed $133.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $364 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $497.4 million, making the film one of the highest grossing films of 2004, alongside &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; and &quot;Shrek 2&quot;. When the film was completed, total production costs were approximately $185 million, making &quot;Troy&quot; one of the most expensive films produced at that time. It was screened out of competition at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.

The film made $46.9 million in its opening weekend, topping the box office, then $23.9 million in its second weekend falling to second.

The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;A brawny, entertaining spectacle, but lacking emotional resonance.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert rated the film two out of four stars, saying: &quot;Pitt is modern, nuanced, introspective; he brings complexity to a role where it is not required.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; critics Christopher Monfette and Cindy White praised the director&#x27;s cut as superior to the early version, evaluating it with eight stars out of ten.

Peter O&#x27;Toole, who played Priam, spoke negatively of the film during an appearance at the Savannah Film Festival, stating he walked out of the film fifteen minutes into a screening, and criticized the director, slamming him as &quot;a clown&quot;. Years later, Brad Pitt expressed disappointment with the film, saying: &quot;I had to do &quot;Troy&quot; because [...] I pulled out of another movie and then had to do something for the studio. So I was put in &quot;Troy&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t painful, but I realized that the way that movie was being told was not how I wanted it to be. I made my own mistakes in it. What am I trying to say about &quot;Troy&quot;? I could not get out of the middle of the frame. It was driving me crazy. I&#x27;d become spoiled working with David Fincher. It&#x27;s no slight on Wolfgang Petersen. &quot;Das Boot&quot; is one of the all-time great films. But somewhere in it, &quot;Troy&quot; became a commercial kind of thing. Every shot was like, &#x27;Here&#x27;s the hero!&#x27; There was no mystery.&quot;

Some have criticized screenwriter David Benioff, who later became one of the creators of the fantasy TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, for taking on too much material by covering the complete and lengthy chronology of the Trojan War, but he said he was aware of this challenge. He is quoted addressing this rather bluntly in an article by actor David Goldsmith in the journal &quot;Creative Screenwriting&quot;: &quot;The script covers the Trojan War in its entirety, whereas &quot;Iliad&quot; is only one fragment of it. I didn&#x27;t want to have little titles saying, &#x27;Flash forward nine years.&#x27; It would have made it more faithful to the source material, but it wouldn&#x27;t have been effective for the movie. I always followed the route that I thought was better for the movie; if that meant that I was cheating on Homer then so be it.&quot;

<text>The Palace of Whitehall – also spelled White Hall – at Westminster was the main residence of the English monarchs from 1530 until 1698, when most of its structures, with the notable exception of Inigo Jones&#x27;s Banqueting House of 1622, were destroyed by fire. Henry VIII moved the royal residence to White Hall after the old royal apartments at the nearby Palace of Westminster were themselves destroyed by fire. Although the Whitehall palace has not survived, the area where it was located is still called Whitehall and has remained a centre of the British government.

White Hall was at one time the largest palace in Europe, with more than 1,500 rooms, before itself being overtaken by the expanding Palace of Versailles, which was to reach 2,400 rooms. At its most expansive, the palace extended over much of the area bordered by Northumberland Avenue in the north; to Downing Street and nearly to Derby Gate in the south; and from roughly the elevations of the current buildings facing Horse Guards Road in the west, to the then banks of the River Thames in the east (the construction of Victoria Embankment has since reclaimed more land from the Thames)—a total of about . It was about from Westminster Abbey.

== History ==
By the 13th century, the Palace of Westminster had become the centre of government in England, and had been the main metropolitan residence of the king since 1049. The surrounding area became a popular and expensive location. Walter de Grey, Archbishop of York, bought a nearby property as his Westminster residence soon after 1240, calling it York Place.

King Edward I stayed at York Place on several occasions while work was carried out at Westminster, and enlarged it to accommodate his entourage. York Place was rebuilt during the 15th century and was expanded so much by Cardinal Wolsey that it was rivalled by only Lambeth Palace as the greatest house in the capital city, the King&#x27;s palaces included. Consequently, when King Henry VIII removed the cardinal from power in 1530, he acquired York Place to replace Westminster (the royal residential, or &#x27;privy&#x27;, area of which had been gutted by fire in 1512) as his main residence, inspecting its possessions in the company of Anne Boleyn. The name &#x27;Whitehall&#x27; was first recorded in 1532; it had its origins in the white stone used for the buildings.

King Henry VIII hired the Flemish artist Anton van den Wyngaerde to redesign York Place, and he extended it during his lifetime. Inspired by Richmond Palace, he included sporting facilities, with a bowling green, indoor real tennis court, a pit for cock fighting (on the site of the Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall) and a tiltyard for jousting (now the site of Horse Guards Parade). It is estimated that more than £30,000 (several million at present-day value) were spent during the 1540s, half as much again as the construction of the entire Bridewell Palace. Henry VIII decorated his gardens with carved heraldic beasts, including unicorns, set on wooden posts. The posts were painted by the Serjeant Painters Nicholas Lafore and Anthony Toto. Henry VIII married two of his wives at the palace—Anne Boleyn in 1533 and Jane Seymour in 1536, and died there in January 1547.

Anne of Denmark&#x27;s secretary, William Fowler wrote Latin verses and anagrams for a sundial in the garden, restored by the orders of James VI and I. In 1611, the palace hosted the first known performance of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot;. In February 1613 it was the venue for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V of the Palatinate. Anne of Denmark&#x27;s apartments were painted in &quot;antique work&quot; by John de Critz and the fireplaces carved by Maximilian Colt. A withdrawing chamber for James VI and I featured a wind dial or compass connected to a weather vane on the roof, and the room was painted by John de Critz with a scheme of the four winds, the four corners of the earth, and the four elements.

The forty rooms of the lodgings provided for King James&#x27;s favourite Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset included a picture gallery in a converted bowling alley. James VI and I made significant changes to the buildings, notably the construction in 1622 of a new Banqueting House built to a design by Inigo Jones to replace a series of previous banqueting houses dating from the time of Elizabeth I. Its decoration was finished in 1634 with the completion of a ceiling by Peter Paul Rubens, commissioned by Charles I (who was to be executed in front of the building in 1649).

By 1650 Whitehall Palace was the largest complex of secular buildings in England, with more than 1,500 rooms. Its layout was irregular, and its constituent parts were of many different sizes and in several different architectural styles, making it look more like a small town than a single building. The irregularity of the buildings was increased by the penchant of courtiers to build onto their assigned lodgings, either at their own expense or that of the king&#x27;s. Stephen Fox, Charles II&#x27;s Clerk of the Green Cloth, obtained permission from the Office of Works in the 1660s to build additions to the three rooms he was assigned. By the time he was finished he had constructed a grand mansion with coach house, stables, and a view over the Thames, all within the palace network.

Charles II commissioned minor works, but made extensive renovations. Like his father, he died at the palace, but from a stroke. James II ordered various changes by Christopher Wren, including a chapel finished in 1687, rebuilding of the queen&#x27;s apartments (), and the queen&#x27;s private lodgings (1689). The Roman Catholic chapel of James II, constructed during a period of fierce anti-Catholicism in England, attracted much criticism and also awe when it was completed in December 1686. The ceiling was adorned with 8,132 pieces of gold leaf, and at the east end of the nave an enormous marble altarpiece ( high by wide) designed by Wren and carved by Grinling Gibbons dominated the room.

== Destruction ==
By 1691 the palace had become the largest and most complex in Europe. On 10 April a fire broke out in the much-renovated apartment previously used by the Duchess of Portsmouth, damaging the older palace structures, though apparently not the state apartments. This actually gave a greater cohesiveness to the remaining complex. At the end of 1694 Mary II died in Kensington Palace of smallpox, and on the following 24 January lay in state at Whitehall; William and Mary had avoided Whitehall in favour of their palace at Kensington.

A second fire on 4 January 1698 destroyed most of the remaining residential and government buildings. It was started inadvertently by a servant in an upper room who had hung wet linen around a burning charcoal brazier to dry. The linen caught fire and the flames quickly spread throughout the palace complex, raging for 15 hours before firefighters could extinguish it. The following day, the wind picked up and re-ignited the fire farther north. Christopher Wren, then the King&#x27;s Surveyor of Works, was ordered expressly by William III to focus manpower on saving the architectural jewel of the complex, the Banqueting House. Wren ordered bricklayers to block up the main window on the building&#x27;s south side to block the flames from entering. Around 20 buildings were destroyed to create a firebreak, but this did little to inhibit the westward spread of the flames.

John Evelyn noted succinctly on 5 January: &quot;Whitehall burnt! nothing but walls and ruins left.&quot; Besides the Banqueting House, some buildings survived in Scotland Yard and some facing the park, along with the so-called Holbein Gate, eventually demolished in 1769.

During the fire many works of art were destroyed, probably including Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Cupid&quot;, a famous sculpture bought as part of the Gonzaga collections in the seventeenth century. Also lost were Hans Holbein the Younger&#x27;s iconic Whitehall Mural, including his &quot;Portrait of Henry VIII&quot; and Gian Lorenzo Bernini&#x27;s marble portrait bust of King Charles I.

== Present day ==

The Banqueting House is the only integral building of the complex now standing, although it has been somewhat modified. Various other parts of the old palace still exist, often incorporated into new buildings in the Whitehall government complex. These include a tower and other parts of the former covered tennis courts from the time of Henry VIII, built into the Old Treasury and Cabinet Office at 70 Whitehall.
Beginning in 1938, the east side of the site was redeveloped with the building now housing the Ministry of Defence (MOD), now known as the Ministry of Defence Main Building. An undercroft from Wolsey&#x27;s Great Chamber, now known as Henry VIII&#x27;s Wine Cellar, a fine example of a Tudor brick-vaulted roof some long and wide, was found to interfere not just with the plan for the new building but also with the proposed route for Horse Guards Avenue. Following a request from Queen Mary in 1938 and a promise in Parliament, provision was made for the preservation of the cellar. Accordingly, it was encased in steel and concrete and relocated to the west and nearly deeper in 1949, when construction resumed on the site after the Second World War. This was carried out without any significant damage to the structure and it now rests within the basement of the building.
A number of marble carvings from the former chapel at Whitehall (which was built for James II) are present in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Burnham-on-Sea, in Somerset, to where they were moved in 1820 after having originally been removed to Westminster Abbey in 1706.

<doc id="323725" wikidata="Q185524" url="?curid=323725" title="Oracle Database">
<text>Oracle Database (commonly referred to as Oracle DBMS, Oracle Autonomous Database, or simply as Oracle) is a proprietary multi-model database management system produced and marketed by Oracle Corporation.

It is a database commonly used for running online transaction processing (OLTP), data warehousing (DW) and mixed (OLTP &amp; DW) database workloads. Oracle Database is available by several service providers on-premises, on-cloud, or as a hybrid cloud installation. It may be run on third party servers as well as on Oracle hardware (Exadata on-premises, on Oracle Cloud or at Cloud at Customer).

Oracle Database uses SQL for database updating and retrieval.

== History ==

Larry Ellison and his two friends and former co-workers, Bob Miner and Ed Oates, started a consultancy called Software Development Laboratories (SDL) in 1977. SDL developed the original version of the Oracle software. The name &quot;Oracle&quot; comes from the code-name of a CIA-funded project Ellison had worked on while formerly employed by Ampex.

=== Releases and versions ===

Oracle products follow a custom release-numbering and -naming convention. The &quot;ai&quot; in the current release, Oracle Database 23ai, stands for &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;. Previous releases (e.g. Oracle Database 19c, 10g, and Oracle9i Database) have used suffixes of &quot;c&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, and &quot;i&quot; which stand for &quot;Cloud&quot;, &quot;Grid&quot;, and &quot;Internet&quot; respectively. Prior to the release of Oracle8i Database, no suffixes featured in Oracle Database naming conventions. There was no v1 of Oracle Database, as co-founder Larry Ellison &quot;knew no one would want to buy version 1&quot;. For some database releases, Oracle also provides an Express Edition (XE) that is free to use.

Oracle Database release numbering has used the following codes:


The Introduction to Oracle Database includes a brief history on some of the key innovations introduced with each major release of Oracle Database.

See My Oracle Support (MOS) note &quot;Release Schedule of Current Database Releases (Doc ID 742060.1)&quot; for the current Oracle Database releases and their patching end dates.

=== Patch updates and security alerts ===

Prior to Oracle Database 18c, Oracle Corporation released Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Security Patch Updates (SPUs) and Security Alerts to close security vulnerabilities. These releases are issued quarterly; some of these releases have updates issued prior to the next quarterly release.

Starting with Oracle Database 18c, Oracle Corporation releases Release Updates (RUs) and Release Update Revisions (RURs). RUs usually contain security, regression (bug), optimizer, and functional fixes which may include feature extensions as well. RURs include all fixes from their corresponding RU but only add new security and regression fixes. However, no new optimizer or functional fixes are included.

=== Competition ===

In the market for relational databases, Oracle Database competes against commercial products such as IBM Db2 and Microsoft SQL Server. Oracle and IBM tend to battle for the mid-range database market on Unix and Linux platforms, while Microsoft dominates the mid-range database market on Microsoft Windows platforms. However, since they share many of the same customers, Oracle and IBM tend to support each other&#x27;s products in many middleware and application categories (for example: WebSphere, PeopleSoft, and Siebel Systems CRM), and IBM&#x27;s hardware divisions work closely with Oracle on performance-optimizing server-technologies (for example, Linux on IBM Z). Niche commercial competitors include Teradata (in data warehousing and business intelligence), Software AG&#x27;s ADABAS, Sybase, and IBM&#x27;s Informix, among many others.

In the cloud, Oracle Database competes against the database services of AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

Increasingly, the Oracle database products compete against open-source software relational and non-relational database systems such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Couchbase, Neo4j, ArangoDB and others. Oracle acquired Innobase, supplier of the InnoDB codebase to MySQL, in part to compete better against open source alternatives, and acquired Sun Microsystems, owner of MySQL, in 2010. Database products licensed as open-source are, by the legal terms of the Open Source Definition, free to distribute and free of royalty or other licensing fees.

<doc id="323726" wikidata="Q1141770" url="?curid=323726" title="Crown entity">
<text>A Crown entity (from the Commonwealth term &quot;Crown&quot;) is an organisation that forms part of New Zealand&#x27;s state sector established under the Crown Entities Act 2004, a unique umbrella governance and accountability statute. The Crown Entities Act is based on the corporate model where the governance of the organisation is split from the management of the organisation.

==Types of crown entities==
Crown entities come under the following types:

* Statutory entities – bodies corporate established under an Act
** Crown agents – organisations that give effect to government policy, such as the Accident Compensation Corporation, which administers no-fault workers compensation
** Autonomous Crown entities (ACE), which must have regard to government policy, such as Te Papa, the national museum
** Independent Crown entities (ICE), which are generally independent of government policy, such as the Commerce Commission, which enforces legislation promoting competition
* Crown entity companies – registered companies wholly owned by the Crown, including Crown Research Institutes (CRIs) and a small number of other companies
* Crown entity subsidiaries – companies that are subsidiaries of Crown entities
* School boards of trustees
* Tertiary education institutions, including universities, colleges of education, polytechnics, and wānanga

Crown entities can be contrasted with other New Zealand public sector organisational forms: departments of state, state-owned enterprises, offices of Parliament and &quot;sui generis&quot; organisations like the Reserve Bank.

==Crown entities, responsible ministers and monitoring departments==
Under the Crown Entities Act, ministers are required to &quot;oversee and manage&quot; the Crown&#x27;s interests in the Crown entities within their portfolio (sections 27 and 88). The board of the entity has the key role in ensuring the entity is achieving results within budget. This is done by a monitoring department on behalf of the minister unless other arrangements for monitoring are made. Monitoring departments make explicit agreements with their minister, setting out what monitoring they will undertake and how they will do it. Crown entity boards should also facilitate clear and transparent monitoring, for example, by providing the minister and monitoring department with good information on which to make judgements about performance.

<doc id="323730" wikidata="Q1160895" url="?curid=323730" title="Treaty of London (1839)">
<text>The Treaty of London of 1839, was signed on 19 April 1839 between the major European powers, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the Kingdom of Belgium. It was a direct follow-up to the 1831 Treaty of the XVIII Articles, which the Netherlands had refused to sign, and the result of negotiations at the London Conference of 1838–1839 which sought to maintain the Concert of Europe.

Under the treaty, the European powers recognised and guaranteed the independence and neutrality of Belgium and established the full independence of the German-speaking part of Luxembourg. Article VII required Belgium to remain perpetually neutral. Following the German invasion of 1914, Belgium abandoned its policy of neutrality (except for a brief, unsuccessful resumption from 1936 to 1940).

==Background==

Since 1815, Belgium had been a reluctant part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. In 1830, Belgians broke away and established an independent Kingdom of Belgium. The overwhelmingly Catholic population could not accept the Dutch king&#x27;s favouritism toward Protestantism, while French-speakers were irritated by his disdain for the French language, and the middle classes objected to the Dutch monopolisation of public offices. Liberals regarded King William I&#x27;s rule as despotic, while there were high levels of unemployment and industrial unrest among the working classes.

Small-scale fighting – the death of some 600 volunteers is commemorated in the Place des Martyrs, Brussels – was followed by an international settlement in 1831. However the settlement was not accepted by the Dutch, who invaded the country in the autumn of 1831; and it took a French army recapturing Antwerp in 1832 before Belgium and the Netherlands could even agree an armistice. Several years later, the Netherlands recognised that they stood to gain more territory by accepting the 1831 settlement than from a mere continuance of the armistice. The Belgian government protested, with French support, against the late implementation of the settlement terms, but Britain accepted the Dutch claim; and in 1839, the Dutch accepted Belgian independence (and regained the disputed territories) by the Treaty of London. At the same time, the major powers all guaranteed Belgium&#x27;s independence from the Netherlands.

==Territorial consequences==
With the treaty, the southern provinces of the Netherlands, independent &quot;de facto&quot; since 1830, became internationally recognised as the Kingdom of Belgium, while the Province of Limburg was split into Belgian and Dutch parts.

The Grand Duchy of Luxemburg was in a personal union with the Netherlands and simultaneously a member of the German Confederation. The treaty partitioned the grand duchy. It lost two-thirds of its territory to Belgium&#x27;s new Province of Luxembourg. The partitioning left a rump grand duchy, covering one-third of the original territory and inhabited by one-half of the original population, in personal union with the Netherlands, under King-Grand Duke William I (and subsequently William II and William III). This arrangement was confirmed by the 1867 Treaty of London, known as the &#x27;Second Treaty of London&#x27; in reference to the 1839 treaty, and lasted until the death of King-Grand Duke William III 23 November 1890.

==Belgian neutrality==

Belgium&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; independence had been established through nine years of intermittent fighting in the 1830s against The Netherlands. The co-signatories of the Treaty of London recognised the independent Kingdom of Belgium. The five great powers of Europe (Austria, France, Prussia, Russia, and the United Kingdom) also pledged to guarantee Belgium&#x27;s neutrality.

The treaty was a fundamental &quot;lawmaking&quot; treaty that became a cornerstone of European international law; it was especially important in the Causes of World War I. On 31 July 1914, the mobilisation of the Belgian Army was ordered and the Belgian king publicly called Europe&#x27;s attention to the fact that Germany, Great Britain and France were legally bound to defend the neutrality of his country. When the German Empire invaded Belgium in August 1914 despite the treaty, after an unanswered ultimatum Britain declared war on 4 August. Informed by the British ambassador that Britain would go to war with Germany over the latter&#x27;s violation of Belgian neutrality, German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg exclaimed that he could not believe that Britain and Germany would be going to war over a mere &quot;scrap of paper&quot;.

The reasoning may have had at least as much to do with the British fear that lack of their help leading to a possible defeat of France could lead to German hegemony in Western Europe, with Christopher Clark pointing out that the British cabinet decided on 29 July 1914 that, being a signatory to the 1839 treaty, guaranteeing Belgium&#x27;s frontiers did not oblige it to oppose a German invasion of Belgium with military force. According to Isabel V. Hull,

==Iron Rhine==
The Treaty of London also guaranteed Belgium the right of transit by rail or canal over Dutch territory as an outlet to the German Ruhr. This right was reaffirmed in a 24 May 2005 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in a dispute between Belgium and the Netherlands on the railway track.

In 2004 Belgium requested a reopening of the Iron Rhine railway. This was the result of the increasing transport of goods between the port of Antwerp and the German Ruhr Area. As part of the European policy of modal shift on the increasing traffic of goods, transport over railway lines and waterways was now preferred over road transport. The Belgian request was based on the treaty of 1839, and the Iron Rhine Treaty of 1873. After a series of failed negotiations, the Belgian and Dutch governments agreed to take the issue to the Permanent Court of Arbitration and respect its ruling in the case.

In a ruling of 24 May 2005, the court acknowledged both the Belgian rights under the cessation treaty of 1839 and the Dutch concerns for part of the Meinweg National Park nature reserve. The 1839 treaty still applied, the court found, giving Belgium the right to use and modernise the Iron Rhine. However, Belgium would be obliged to finance the modernisation of the line, while the Netherlands had to fund the repairs and maintenance of the route. Both countries were to share the costs of a tunnel beneath the nature reserve.

<doc id="323737" wikidata="Q3504641" url="?curid=323737" title="Superfund">
<text>Superfund is a United States federal environmental remediation program established by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). The program is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and is designed to pay for investigating and cleaning up sites contaminated with hazardous substances. Sites managed under this program are referred to as Superfund sites. Of the tens of thousands of sites selected for possible action under the Superfund program, 1178 (as of 2024) remain on the National Priorities List (NPL) that makes them eligible for cleanup under the Superfund program. Sites on the NPL are considered the most highly contaminated and undergo longer-term remedial investigation and remedial action (cleanups). The state of New Jersey, the fifth smallest state in the U.S., is the location of about ten percent of the priority Superfund sites, a disproportionate amount.

The EPA seeks to identify parties responsible for hazardous substances released to the environment (polluters) and either compel them to clean up the sites, or it may undertake the cleanup on its own using the Superfund (a trust fund) and seek to recover those costs from the responsible parties through settlements or other legal means.

Approximately 70% of Superfund cleanup activities historically have been paid for by the potentially responsible parties (PRPs), reflecting the polluter pays principle. However, 30% of the time the responsible party either cannot be found or is unable to pay for the cleanup. In these circumstances, taxpayers had been paying for the cleanup operations. Through the 1980s, most of the funding came from an excise tax on petroleum and chemical manufacturers. However, in 1995, Congress chose not to renew this tax and the burden of the cost was shifted to taxpayers in the general public. Since 2001, most of the cleanup of hazardous waste sites has been funded through taxpayers generally. Despite its name, the program suffered from under-funding, and by 2014 Superfund NPL cleanups had decreased to only 8 sites, out of over 1,200. In November 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act reauthorized an excise tax on chemical manufacturers, for ten years starting in July 2022.

The EPA and state agencies use the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) to calculate a site score (ranging from 0 to 100) based on the actual or potential release of hazardous substances from a site. A score of 28.5 places a site on the National Priorities List, eligible for long-term, remedial action (i.e., cleanup) under the Superfund program. , there were 1,333 sites listed; an additional 448 had been delisted, and 43 new sites have been proposed.

Superfund also authorizes natural resource trustees, which may be federal, state, and/or tribal, to perform a Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA). Natural resource trustees determine and quantify injuries caused to natural resources through either releases of hazardous substances or cleanup actions and then seek to restore ecosystem services to the public through conservation, restoration, and/or acquisition of equivalent habitat. Responsible parties are assessed damages for the cost of the assessment and the restoration of ecosystem services. For the federal government, EPA, US Fish and Wildlife Service, or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration may act as natural resource trustees. The US Department of Interior keeps a list of the natural resource trustees appointed by state&#x27;s governors. Federally recognized Tribes may act as trustees for natural resources, including natural resources related to Tribal subsistence, cultural uses, spiritual values, and uses that are preserved by treaties. Tribal natural resource trustees are appointed by tribal governments. Some states have their own versions of a state Superfund law and may perform NRDA either through state laws or through other federal authorities such as the Oil Pollution Act. 

CERCLA created the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).

The primary goal of a Superfund cleanup is to reduce the risks to human health through a combination of cleanup, engineered controls like caps and site restrictions such as groundwater use restrictions. A secondary goal is to return the site to productive use as a business, recreation or as a natural ecosystem. Identifying the intended reuse early in the cleanup often results in faster and less expensive cleanups. EPA&#x27;s Superfund Redevelopment Program provides tools and support for site redevelopment.

==History ==

CERCLA was enacted by Congress in 1980 in response to the threat of hazardous waste sites, typified by the Love Canal disaster in New York, and the Valley of the Drums in Kentucky. It was recognized that funding would be difficult, since the responsible parties were not easily found, and so the Superfund was established to provide funding through a taxing mechanism on certain industries and to create a comprehensive liability framework to be able to hold a broader range of parties responsible. The initial Superfund trust fund to clean up sites where a polluter could not be identified, could not or would not pay (bankruptcy or refusal), consisted of about $1.6 billion and then increased to $8.5 billion. Initially, the framework for implementing the program came from the oil and hazardous substances National Contingency Plan.

The EPA published the first Hazard Ranking System in 1981, and the first National Priorities List in 1983. Implementation of the program in early years, during the Ronald Reagan administration, was ineffective, with only 16 of the 799 Superfund sites cleaned up and only $40 million of $700 million in recoverable funds from responsible parties collected. The mismanagement of the program under Anne Gorsuch Burford, Reagan&#x27;s first chosen Administrator of the agency, led to a congressional investigation and the reauthorization of the program in 1986 through an act amending CERCLA.

=== 1986 amendments ===
The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) added minimum cleanup requirements in Section 121 and required that most cleanup agreements with polluters be entered in federal court as a consent decree subject to public comment (section 122). This was to address sweetheart deals between industry and the Reagan-era EPA that Congress had discovered.

=== Environmental justice initiative ===
In 1994 President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which called for federal agencies to make achieving environmental justice a requirement by addressing low income populations and minority populations that have experienced disproportionate adverse health and environmental effects as a result of their programs, policies, and activities. The EPA regional offices had to apply required guidelines for its Superfund managers to take into consideration data analysis, managed public participation, and economic opportunity when considering the geography of toxic waste site remediation. Some environmentalists and industry lobbyists saw the Clinton administration&#x27;s environmental justice policy as an improvement, but the order did not receive bipartisan support. The newly elected Republican Congress made numerous unsuccessful efforts to significantly weaken the program. The Clinton administration then adopted some industry favored reforms as policy and blocked most major changes.

=== Decline of excise tax ===
Until the mid-1990s, most of the funding came from an excise tax on the petroleum and chemical industries, reflecting the polluter pays principle. Even though by 1995 the Superfund balance had decreased to about $4 billion, Congress chose not to reauthorize collection of the tax, and by 2003 the fund was empty. Since 2001, most of the funding for cleanups of hazardous waste sites has come from taxpayers. State governments pay 10 percent of cleanup costs in general, and at least 50 percent of cleanup costs if the state operated the facility responsible for contamination. By 2013 federal funding for the program had decreased from $2 billion in 1999 to less than $1.1 billion (in constant dollars).

In 2001, the EPA used funds from the Superfund program to institute the cleanup of anthrax on Capitol Hill after the 2001 anthrax attacks. It was the first time the agency dealt with a biological release rather than a chemical or oil spill.

From 2000 to 2015, Congress allocated about $1.26 billion of general revenue to the Superfund program each year. Consequently, less than half the number of sites were cleaned up from 2001 to 2008, compared to before. The decrease continued during the Obama administration, and since under the direction of EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy Superfund cleanups decreased even more from 20 in 2009 to a mere 8 in 2014.

=== Reauthorization of excise tax ===
In November 2021, Congress reauthorized an excise tax on chemical manufacturers, under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The new chemical excise tax is effective July 1, 2022, and is double the rate of the previous Superfund tax. The 2021 law also authorized $3.5 billion in emergency appropriations from the U.S. government general fund for hazardous site cleanups in the immediate future.

==Provisions==
CERCLA authorizes two kinds of response actions:
# Removal actions. These are typically short-term response actions, where actions may be taken to address releases or threatened releases requiring prompt response. Removal actions are classified as: (1) emergency; (2) time-critical; and (3) non-time critical. Removal responses are generally used to address localized risks such as abandoned drums containing hazardous substances, and contaminated surface soils posing acute risks to human health or the environment.
# Remedial actions. These are usually long-term response actions. Remedial actions seek to permanently and significantly reduce the risks associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances, and are generally larger, more expensive actions. They can include measures such as using containment to prevent pollutants from migrating, and combinations of removing, treating, or neutralizing toxic substances. These actions can be conducted with federal funding only at sites listed on the EPA National Priorities List (NPL) in the United States and the territories. Remedial action by responsible parties under consent decrees or unilateral administrative orders with EPA oversight may be performed at both NPL and non-NPL sites, commonly called Superfund Alternative Sites in published EPA guidance and policy documents.

A &quot;potentially responsible party&quot; (PRP) is a possible polluter who may eventually be held liable under CERCLA for the contamination or misuse of a particular property or resource. Four classes of PRPs may be liable for contamination at a Superfund site:
# the current owner or operator of the site;
# the owner or operator of a site at the time that disposal of a hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant occurred;
# a person who arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant at a site; and
# a person who transported a hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant to a site, who also has selected that site for the disposal of the hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants.
The liability scheme of CERCLA changed commercial and industrial real estate, making sellers liable for contamination from past activities, meaning they can&#x27;t pass liability onto unknowing buyers without any responsibility. Buyers also have to be aware of future liabilities.

The CERCLA also required the revision of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan 9605(a)(NCP). The NCP guides how to respond to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. The NCP established the National Priorities List, which appears as Appendix B to the NCP, and serves as EPA&#x27;s information and management tool. The NPL is updated periodically by federal rulemaking.

The identification of a site for the NPL is intended primarily to guide the EPA in:
* Determining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the nature and extent of risks to human health and the environment
* Identifying what CERCLA-financed remedial actions may be appropriate
* Notifying the public of sites, the EPA believes warrant further investigation
* Notifying PRPs that the EPA may initiate CERCLA-financed remedial action.

Despite the name, the Superfund trust fund has lacked sufficient funds to clean up even a small number of the sites on the NPL. As a result, the EPA typically negotiates consent orders with PRPs to study sites and develop cleanup alternatives, subject to EPA oversight and approval of all such activities. The EPA then issues a Proposed Plans for remedial action for a site on which it takes public comment, after which it makes a cleanup decision in a Record of Decision (ROD). RODs are typically implemented under consent decrees by PRPs or under unilateral orders if consent cannot be reached. If a party fails to comply with such an order, it may be fined up to $37,500 for each day that non-compliance continues. A party that spends money to clean up a site may sue other PRPs in a contribution action under the CERCLA. CERCLA liability has generally been judicially established as joint and several among PRPs to the government for cleanup costs (i.e., each PRP is hypothetically responsible for all costs subject to contribution), but CERCLA liability is allocable among PRPs in contribution based on comparative fault. An &quot;orphan share&quot; is the share of costs at a Superfund site that is attributable to a PRP that is either unidentifiable or insolvent. The EPA tries to treat all PRPs equitably and fairly. Budgetary cuts and constraints can make more equitable treatment of PRPs more difficult.

==Procedures==
Upon notification of a potentially hazardous waste site, the EPA conducts a Preliminary Assessment/Site Inspection (PA/SI), which involves records reviews, interviews, visual inspections, and limited field sampling. Information from the PA/SI is used by the EPA to develop a Hazard Ranking System (HRS) score to determine the CERCLA status of the site. Sites that score high enough to be listed typically proceed to a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS).

The RI includes an extensive sampling program and risk assessment that defines the nature and extent of the site contamination and risks. The FS is used to develop and evaluate various remediation alternatives. The preferred alternative is presented in a Proposed Plan for public review and comment, followed by a selected alternative in a ROD. The site then enters into a Remedial Design phase and then the Remedial Action phase. Many sites include long-term monitoring. Once the Remedial Action has been completed, reviews are required every five years, whenever hazardous substances are left onsite above levels safe for unrestricted use.

*The &quot;CERCLA information system&quot; (CERCLIS) is a database maintained by the EPA and the states that lists sites where releases may have occurred, must be addressed, or have been addressed. CERCLIS consists of three inventories: the CERCLIS Removal Inventory, the CERCLIS Remedial Inventory, and the CERCLIS Enforcement Inventory.
*The &quot;Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation&quot; (SITE) program supports development of technologies for assessing and treating waste at Superfund sites. The EPA evaluates the technology and provides an assessment of its potential for future use in Superfund remediation actions. The SITE program consists of four related components: the Demonstration Program, the Emerging Technologies Program, the Monitoring and Measurement Technologies Program, and Technology Transfer activities.
*A &quot;reportable quantity&quot; (RQ) is the minimum quantity of a hazardous substance which, if released, must be reported.
*A &quot;source control action&quot; represents the construction or installation and start-up of those actions necessary to prevent the continued release of hazardous substances (primarily from a source on top of or within the ground, or in buildings or other structures) into the environment.
*A &quot;section 104(e) letter&quot; is a request by the government for information about a site. It may include general notice to a potentially responsible party that CERCLA-related action may be undertaken at a site for which the recipient may be responsible. This section also authorizes the EPA to enter facilities and obtain information relating to PRPs, hazardous substances releases, and liability, and to order access for CERCLA activities. The 104(e) letter information-gathering resembles written interrogatories in civil litigation.
*A &quot;section 106 order&quot; is a unilateral administrative order issued by EPA to PRP(s) to perform remedial actions at a Superfund site when the EPA determines there may be an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of a hazardous substance from a facility, subject to treble damages and daily fines if the order is not obeyed.
*A &quot;remedial response&quot; is a long-term action that stops or substantially reduces a release of a hazardous substance that could affect public health or the environment. The term remediation, or cleanup, is sometimes used interchangeably with the terms remedial action, removal action, response action, remedy, or corrective action.
**A &quot;nonbinding allocation of responsibility&quot; (NBAR) is a device, established in the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, that allows the EPA to make a nonbinding estimate of the proportional share that each of the various responsible parties at a Superfund site should pay toward the costs of cleanup.
*&quot;Relevant and appropriate requirements&quot; are those United States federal or state cleanup requirements that, while not &quot;applicable,&quot; address problems sufficiently similar to those encountered at the CERCLA site that their use is appropriate. Requirements may be relevant and appropriate if they would be &quot;applicable&quot; except for jurisdictional restrictions associated with the requirement.

==Implementation==
, there were 1,322 sites listed; an additional 447 had been delisted, and 51 new sites have been proposed.

Historically about 70 percent of Superfund cleanup activities have been paid for by potentially responsible party (PRPs). When the party either cannot be found or is unable to pay for the cleanup, the Superfund law originally paid for site cleanups through an excise tax on petroleum and chemical manufacturers.

The last full fiscal year (FY) in which the Department of the Treasury collected the excise tax was 1995. At the end of FY 1996, the invested trust fund balance was $6.0 billion. This fund was exhausted by the end of FY 2003. Since that time Superfund sites for which the PRPs could not pay have been paid for from the general fund. Under the 2021 authorization by Congress, collection of excise taxes from chemical manufacturers will resume in 2022.

===Hazard Ranking System===
The Hazard Ranking System is a scoring system used to evaluate potential relative risks to public health and the environment from releases or threatened releases of hazardous wastes at uncontrolled waste sites. Under the Superfund program, the EPA and state agencies use the HRS to calculate a site score (ranging from 0 to 100) based on the actual or potential release of hazardous substances from a site through air, surface water or groundwater. A score of 28.5 places the site on the National Priorities List, making the site eligible for long-term remedial action (i.e., cleanup) under the Superfund program.

== Environmental discrimination==
Federal actions to address the disproportionate health and environmental disparities that minority and low-income populations face through Executive Order 12898 required federal agencies to make environmental justice central to their programs and policies. Superfund sites have been shown to impact minority communities the most. Despite legislation specifically designed to ensure equity in Superfund listing, marginalized populations still experience a lesser chance of successful listing and cleanup than areas with higher income levels. After the executive order had been put in place, there persisted a discrepancy between the demographics of the communities living near toxic waste sites and their listing as Superfund sites, which would otherwise grant them federally funded cleanup projects. Communities with both increased minority and low-income populations were found to have lowered their chances of site listing after the executive order, while on the other hand, increases in income led to greater chances of site listing. Of the populations living within 1 mile radius of a Superfund site, 44% of those are minorities despite only being around 37% of the nation&#x27;s population.

As of January 2021, more than 9,000 federally subsidized properties, including ones with hundreds of dwellings, were less than a mile from a Superfund site.

=== Case studies in African American communities ===
In 1978, residents of the rural black community of Triana, Alabama were found to be contaminated with DDT and PCB, some of whom had the highest levels of DDT ever recorded in human history. The DDT was found in high levels in Indian Creek, which many residents relied on for sustenance fishing. Although this major health threat to residents of Triana was discovered in 1978, the federal government did not act until 5 years later after the mayor of Triana filed a class-action lawsuit in 1980.

In West Dallas, Texas, a mostly African American and Latino community, a lead smelter poisoned the surrounding neighborhood, elementary school, and day cares for more than five decades. Dallas city officials were informed in 1972 that children in the proximity of the smelter were being exposed to lead contamination. The city sued the lead smelters in 1974, then reduced its lead regulations in 1976. It wasn&#x27;t until 1981 that the EPA commissioned a study on the lead contamination in this neighborhood and found the same results that had been found a decade earlier. In 1983, the surrounding day cares had to close due to the lead exposure while the lead smelter remained operating. It was later revealed that EPA Deputy Administrator John Hernandez had deliberately stalled the cleanup of the lead-contaminated hot spots. It wasn&#x27;t until 1993 that the site was declared a Superfund site, and at the time it was one of the largest ones. However, it was not until 2004 when the EPA completed the clean-up efforts and eliminated the lead pollutant sources from the site.

The Afton community of Warren County, North Carolina is one of the most prominent environmental injustice cases and is often pointed to as the roots of the environmental justice movement. PCBs were illegally dumped into the community and then it eventually became a PCB landfill. Community leaders pressed the state for the site to be cleaned up for an entire decade until it was finally detoxified. However, this decontamination did not return the site to its pre-1982 conditions. There has been a call for reparations to the community which has not yet been met.

Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco, a historically African American community, has faced persistent environmental discrimination due to the poor remediation efforts of the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, a federally declared Superfund site. The negligence of multiple agencies to adequately clean this site has led Bayview residents to be subject to high rates of pollution and has been tied to high rates of cancer, asthma, and overall higher health hazards than other regions of San Francisco.

=== Case studies in Native American communities ===

One example is the Church Rock uranium mill spill on the Navajo Nation. It was the largest radioactive spill in the US but received a long delay in government response and cleanup after being placed as a lower priority site. Two sets of five-year cleanup plans have been put in place by US Congress, but contamination from the Church Rock incident has still not been completely cleaned up. Today, uranium contamination from mining during the Cold War era remains throughout the Navajo Nation, posing health risks to the Navajo community.

==Accessing data==
The data in the Superfund Program are available to the public.
* Superfund Site Search
* Superfund Policy, Reports and Other Documents
*TOXMAP was a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) that was deprecated on December 16, 2019. The application used maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the EPA Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) and Superfund programs. TOXMAP was a resource funded by the US Federal Government. TOXMAP&#x27;s chemical and environmental health information is taken from NLM&#x27;s Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET), PubMed, and other authoritative sources.

==Future challenges==
While the simple and relatively easy sites have been cleaned up, EPA is now addressing a residual number of difficult and massive sites such as large-area mining and sediment sites, which is tying up a significant amount of funding. Also, while the federal government has reserved funding for cleanup of federal facility sites, this clean-up is going much more slowly. The delay is due to a number of reasons, including EPA&#x27;s limited ability to require performance, difficulty of dealing with Department of Energy radioactive wastes, and the sheer number of federal facility sites.

<doc id="323740" wikidata="Q1087300" url="?curid=323740" title="The Cinematic Orchestra">
<text>The Cinematic Orchestra is a British nu jazz and downtempo music group created in 1999 by Jason Swinscoe and later involving his music collaborator Dominic Smith. The group is signed to independent record label Ninja Tune.

The Cinematic Orchestra have produced four studio albums, &quot;Motion&quot; (1999), &quot;Every Day&quot; (2002), &quot;Ma Fleur&quot; (2007) and &quot;To Believe&quot; (2019), and two film soundtrack albums, &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos&quot; (2009).

In addition to Swinscoe, the band includes former DJ Food member PC (Patrick Carpenter) on turntables, Luke Flowers on drums, Tom Chant on saxophone, Nick Ramm on piano, Stuart McCallum on guitar, Phil France on double bass. Former members include Jamie Coleman (trumpet), T. Daniel Howard (drums), Federico Ughi (drums), Alex James (piano), and Clean Sadness (synthesizer, programming). Heidi Vogel (vocals) appears as a regular collaborator.

Swinscoe and Carpenter have also recorded together under the band name Neptune.

==Style==
The Cinematic Orchestra&#x27;s sound, in both live and studio contexts, employs a live band which improvises along with a turntablist and electronic elements such as samples provided by Swinscoe. In their studio releases Swinscoe will often remix the live source material to produce a combination of live jazz improvisation with electronica, such that it is difficult to tell where the improvisation ends and the production begins.

==History==
Swinscoe first formed a group called &quot;Crabladder&quot; in 1990, whilst studying Fine Art at Cardiff College, releasing one official single on his own &quot;Power Tools&quot; label. In 1994, Swinscoe was given a DJ spot on Heart FM, a pirate radio station in south London.

The Cinematic Orchestra&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Motion,&quot; was released in 1999. The critical success of that album led to them being asked to perform at the Director&#x27;s Guild Awards ceremony for the presentation of the Lifetime Achievement Award to film director Stanley Kubrick.

The band were asked by the organisers of the Porto European City of Culture 2001 festival to write a new score to Dziga Vertov&#x27;s classic 1929 Soviet Union film &quot;Man with a Movie Camera,&quot; to be performed live in accompaniment with a showing of the silent film. The work differed from the band&#x27;s usual compositions due to its live performance, ruling out the post production work that was present on &quot;Motion.&quot; The Cinematic Orchestra toured the work and later released it as an album. Many of the compositions originally created for that album, &quot;Man with a Movie Camera,&quot; were later adapted from live form (adding in vocal tracks and electronic elements, among other changes) for their next album, &quot;Every Day&quot;. It reached #54 in the UK Albums Chart in May 2002.

In 2006, the Cinematic Orchestra created a cover version of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Exit Music (For a Film)&quot; that appeared on an album titled &quot;Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads.&quot; In this piece the band slowed down the tempo of the original, divided the timbre into four sections beginning with saxophone, to the classical guitar, to the electric guitar, ending the piece with the same simple acoustic guitar rhythm as the original.

The Cinematic Orchestra released the album &quot;Ma Fleur&quot; in May 2007. Several songs feature Patrick Watson, Fontella Bass, or Lou Rhodes on vocals, with Rhodes and Watson sharing vocals on one song.

The Cinematic Orchestra recorded the soundtrack to the Disneynature film &quot;The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos,&quot; released in France in December 2008 (originally as &quot;Les ailes pourpres: Le mystère des flamants).&quot; The score was produced by the band and Steve McLaughlin. The score was performed live with the London Metropolitan Orchestra at Union Chapel, Islington in September 2009 and won the award for Best Original Score for a Documentary Film at the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival in Wyoming, USA in October 2009.

Ninja Tune invited the Cinematic Orchestra to perform at the twentieth anniversary gala performance of the label at the Royal Albert Hall in November 2010.

In 2011, the Cinematic Orchestra commissioned a series of compositions for avant-garde short films that were performed at the Barbican Centre under the auspices of its curating a series entitled &quot;In Motion&quot; (also featuring Dorian Concept with saxophonist Tom Chant, Grey Reverend, and Austin Peralta). It subsequently released the album &quot;In Motion #1&quot; in 2012.

In 2015, they created their own version of Melanie De Biasio&#x27;s track &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Leave You&quot; for the album &quot;Gilles Peterson presents - No Deal Remixed&quot;.

Their fourth studio album, &quot;To Believe,&quot; was released in March 2019.

==Song appearances==

&quot;To Build a Home&quot;, from the album &quot;Ma Fleur&quot; and featuring the vocals of the Canadian singer-songwriter Patrick Watson, has been used extensively in film and television. In 2008, the song was used for the Chivas Regal &quot;Live with Chivalry&quot; advertisement. It was used for Sam &quot;OB&quot; O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s departure in a 2008 episode of the British soap &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;. It has been featured in the films &quot;Trinidad&quot;, &quot;The Tree&quot;, &quot;Polytechnique&quot;, and the 2011 shorts &quot;Rapha Continental&quot; and &quot;This Is Brighton&quot;. The song had also been used for episodes of &quot;jPod&quot;, &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, &quot;Packed to the Rafters&quot;, &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, &quot;On Thin Ice&quot;, &quot;Suits&quot;, &quot;Top Gear&quot;, &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;, on the 2013 broadcast of Comic Relief, on &quot;Supersize vs Super Skinny&quot;, the Australian reality series &quot;The Block Sky High&quot; and on &quot;The Big C&quot;. It was also featured in August 2013 for an extended trailer of the upcoming third series of &quot;Homeland&quot; on Showtime. It appeared in the 2009 documentary &quot;Ingredients: Who&#x27;s Your Farmer?&quot; about the local food movement. The song&#x27;s slow, melancholy melody provided an easy, smooth transition from the first half of the documentary to the next. In 2012, the song was used in a video named &quot;The Most Astounding Fact&quot;, in which science communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson answers a question posed by a &quot;Time&quot; magazine reader. The video was edited by freelance videographer Max Schlickenmeyer who posted it to YouTube, where it garnered more than 9 million views. In 2013, the song was used in an advertisement for Guinness featuring wheelchair basketballers. The song was also used in a UK advert for Sky Atlantic featuring Dustin Hoffman in front of a New York skyline. The advert was produced by WCRS. It is featured in the concluding scene of the 2013 Vanessa Hudgens film &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;. More recently, it appeared in the 2016 film &quot;The Edge of Seventeen&quot;, and the 2016 Ubisoft Annecy video game &quot;Steep&quot;. The 26 January 2016 episode of British soap &quot;EastEnders&quot; featured the song during the scenes following a serious bus accident. In 2017, the season five finale of &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; featured the song in its final scenes. In January 2018, the TV series &quot;This Is Us&quot; used the song during the ending of a second season episode. The song reappeared during the closing scene of a fourth season episode. It also featured in the documentary &quot;Best Wishes, Warmest Regards: A Schitt&#x27;s Creek Farewell&quot; in 2020. It was also used in 2020 in a tribute video by the daughter of author Helen Harris, biographer of Edward Payson Weston.

A shorter version of the song &quot;That Home&quot;, with a slightly different composition, has also been used on occasion, such as an episode of &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;, in an episode of &quot;Suits&quot;, in the trailer for the 2011 film &quot;Another Earth&quot; and in the ABC drama &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;. It also featured in the season seven finale of the FOX dance competition &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;. It was also featured in a trailer for the NBC drama &quot;Awake&quot;. It was also featured as one of the dance performance songs in the 2012 film &quot;Step Up Revolution&quot;.

The Public Radio Exchange radio show &quot;This American Life&quot; often uses the song &quot;Drunken Tune&quot; from the album &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot;.

The final scene and closing credits of the 2006 film &quot;Kidulthood&quot; feature the song &quot;All Things to All Men&quot; from the album &quot;Every Day&quot;. An instrumental version of the song had previously been used in the British television drama &quot;Hustle&quot;. The song also featured on the British soap &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; in December 2009, and appears on &quot;Wonders of the Solar System&quot; briefly (&quot;Thin Blue Line&quot;), narrated by Professor Brian Cox.

Their songs &quot;Burn Out&quot; and &quot;Flite&quot; were featured in the 2012 video game &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;.

In December 2012, the song &quot;Arrival of the Birds&quot; from the soundtrack for &quot;The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos&quot; appears in a commercial for the perfume Acqua di Gioia by Giorgio Armani. The song also appears at the end of the 2014 film &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot; and in the short film Together Apart from the Cornetto Cupidity Series.

An excerpt near the 16 minute mark of the &quot;In Motion #1&quot; track &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot; was used in part two of &quot;Top Gear&#x27;s Africa Special&quot; that originally aired on 10 March 2013.

The song closed the documentary &quot;Noma My Perfect Storm&quot; in 2015.

The second half of &quot;Manhatta&quot; was used in the closing sequence of the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the UK general elections in 2015 and 2017.

The song &quot;To Believe&quot; was featured in the TV show &quot;Fear the Walking Dead (season 6)&quot; episode 8, &quot;The Door&quot;.

The song &quot;A Caged Bird/Imitations of Life (featuring Roots Manuva)&quot; from the album &quot;To Believe&quot;, was featured in racing video game &quot;Need for Speed: Heat&quot;.

<doc id="323743" wikidata="Q1057736" url="?curid=323743" title="Theo Epstein">
<text>Theo Nathaniel Epstein (born December 29, 1973) is an American Major League Baseball executive who is, since 2024, the senior adviser and part-owner of Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball and Liverpool FC of the English Premier League, among other properties. 

Epstein helped to end two of the longest World Series droughts in MLB history. In 2004, when he was vice president and general manager for the Red Sox, the team won their first World Series championship in 86 years. His next job was president of baseball operations for the Chicago Cubs, who in 2016 won their first World Series championship in 108 years. After his tenure in Chicago, he joined MLB as a consultant.

==Early life ==
Epstein was born to a secular Jewish family in New York City and raised in Brookline, Massachusetts. He graduated from Brookline High School in 1991, where he played baseball for the Brookline High School Warriors, but dreamed of working for the Red Sox.

Epstein attended Yale University, where he lived at Jonathan Edwards College. He served as sports editor of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;. He graduated in 1995 with a degree in American Studies. During his time as an undergraduate, he wrote letters to several teams expressing interest in working for them. His letter to the Baltimore Orioles reached team executive Calvin Hill, a Yale alumnus and head of personnel, who invited him for an interview. Epstein interned for three consecutive summers for the Orioles. Eventually he was hired as the public relations assistant for the Orioles.

==Career==
===San Diego Padres===
Epstein then moved with Larry Lucchino to the San Diego Padres as director of player development. While working for the Padres, he also studied at the University of San Diego School of Law and earned a Juris Doctor degree at Lucchino&#x27;s suggestion. Epstein based his class selection on which professors seemed to be the most lenient with attendance policies given the Padres&#x27; often-late work hours. By studying law, Epstein was invited to take part in high-level negotiations and discussions by then-GM Kevin Towers since few in the Padres&#x27; small operations division had a legal background to understand contract language. He worked his way up to become the team&#x27;s director of baseball operations.

===Boston Red Sox===

After leaving the position as the Padres&#x27; President, Lucchino became president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Red Sox on November 15, 2001 and hired Epstein to work under him. At the end of the 2002 season, Lucchino appointed Epstein to replace interim general manager (GM) Mike Port. Epstein is credited with trading away Nomar Garciaparra and acquiring Bill Mueller and Curt Schilling, moves that helped break the &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot; when the Red Sox defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series, their first championship since 1918.

On October 31, 2005, he resigned, rejecting a three-year, $1.5-million-per-year contract for personal reasons. According to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;This is a job you have to give your whole heart and soul to&quot;, he said. &quot;In the end, after a long period of reflection about myself and the program, I decided I could no longer put my whole heart and soul into it.&quot; As it was Halloween the night he resigned from the Red Sox, he left Fenway Park wearing a gorilla suit in an attempt to avoid reporters. A witness reported spotting a person wearing a gorilla suit driving a Volvo similar to Epstein&#x27;s that night. The suit was loaned to him and was later auctioned for $11,000. The money raised was given to The Jimmy Fund and the Foundation to be Named Later (FTBNL).

Epstein remained in contact with the team&#x27;s front office and in January 2006, he and Red Sox management announced he would return, resuming the role of general manager and adding the title of executive vice president. The Red Sox went on to win the 2007 World Series, Epstein&#x27;s second championship with Boston. In November 2007, Epstein announced, at the annual general manager meeting, that he had signed a new contract with the Red Sox but declined to disclose the terms of the deal.

===Chicago Cubs===

On October 12, 2011, Epstein agreed to a five-year contract worth $18.5 million with the Chicago Cubs. On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Epstein&#x27;s official title with the Cubs would be president and that San Diego Padres general manager Jed Hoyer would take the GM position with the Cubs.

On October 23, 2011, he took out a full-page ad in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, thanking Red Sox fans and the team&#x27;s owners for their support. Two days later, the Cubs officially introduced Epstein as
president of baseball operations. The Cubs finished in last place in the National League Central for the first three years of Epstein&#x27;s presidency, as the focus was to acquire young talent rather than maximize short-term competitiveness. After a three-year rebuild, the Cubs clinched a playoff berth in 2015 and advanced to the National League Championship Series, where they were swept by the New York Mets.

Epstein signed an extension with the club on September 28, 2016, with a contract estimated to be worth up to $25 million. The Cubs would proceed to break the so-called &quot;Curse of the Billy Goat&quot; by defeating Cleveland Indians in the 2016 World Series, their first championship since 1908.

Epstein stepped down from his role on the Cubs on November 20, 2020. Jed Hoyer, Epstein&#x27;s long-time deputy, took over his position.

===MLB consultant and private equity===
In January 2021, MLB hired Epstein as a consultant for &quot;on-field matters&quot;. Later that year, he joined private equity firm Arctos Sports Partners.

===Return to Fenway Sports Group===
On February 2, 2024, Fenway Sports Group announced that Epstein would return to the company as a senior adviser, while also joining its ownership group pending MLB approval.

==Personal life==
Epstein has a twin brother, Paul, who is a social worker at Brookline High School in Brookline, Massachusetts. He and Paul are co-founders of &quot;The Foundation to be Named Later&quot;, established in 2005.

Epstein&#x27;s grandfather, Philip G. Epstein, and great-uncle, Julius J. Epstein – with Howard E. Koch – won Academy Awards for the screenplay of &quot;Casablanca&quot;, while his father, novelist Leslie Epstein, heads the Creative Writing Program at Boston University. His mother, Ilene (Gradman), opened a clothing store. Epstein&#x27;s sister, Anya, is a screenwriter and television producer (&quot;&quot; and &quot;Tell Me You Love Me&quot;).

In 2007, Epstein married Marie Whitney, a Catholic and the founder/creative director of Two Penny Blue. The couple have two sons. &quot;Boston Globe&quot; sportswriter Gordon Edes reported that the wedding took place at Nathan&#x27;s Famous hot dog stand at Coney Island, then later published a correction, noting that he had fallen for a prank by Theo&#x27;s father Leslie. The site and actual date of the wedding were never released, but the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; later reported that the wedding took place on Red Sox owner John Henry&#x27;s yacht in Saint Thomas.

===Charity===
Epstein&#x27;s &quot;Hot Stove Cool Music&quot; are biannual Boston and Chicago benefit concerts that have raised millions of dollars for the &quot;disadvantaged youth and families&quot; of the respective cities. Before the 2015 event, Epstein said, &quot;We&#x27;ve collectively raised more than $6 million and look forward to increasing that total this year through another great night of music, baseball and giving back.&quot;

==Honors and awards==
As a front office executive, Epstein is a three-time World Series champion, winning twice with the Red Sox (2004 and 2007) and once with the Cubs (2016). In 2007, the United States Sports Academy named Epstein the recipient of its &quot;Carl Maddox Sport Management Award&quot;.

In December 2008, &quot;Baseball America&quot; named Epstein its &quot;Baseball America&quot; Major League Executive of the Year.

In March 2009, the book &quot;Theo-logy: How a Boy Wonder Led the Red Sox to the Promised Land&quot; was published.

In September 2009, Epstein was named &quot;Sporting News&quot; Executive of the Decade. At the same time, the Red Sox were named &quot;Sporting News&quot; Team of the Decade. In December, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named him MLB&#x27;s Best General Manager of the Decade and number 3 on its list of the Top 10 GMs/Executives of the Decade (in all sports).

In November 2016, Epstein was named the &quot;Sporting News&quot; Executive of the Year. Also in November, Epstein won the Esurance MLB Award for Best Executive.

In March 2017, Epstein was announced as Yale&#x27;s Class Day Speaker. Fortune Magazine also ranked Epstein #1 in their 2017 list of the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Leaders&quot;. 

In April 2017, &quot;Time Magazine&quot; named Epstein one of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people.

<text>Carlos Saavedra Lamas (November 1, 1878 – May 5, 1959) was an Argentine academic and politician, and in 1936, the first Latin American Nobel Peace Prize recipient.

==Biography==
Born in Buenos Aires, Saavedra Lamas was a descendant of an early Argentine patriot. He married the daughter of president Roque Sáenz Peña. Saavedra Lamas achieved renown not only as foreign minister of Argentina for his practical work in drafting international agreements and in conducting international mediation, but also as a professor for his scholarship in the fields of labor legislation and international law.

Saavedra Lamas was a distinguished student at Lacordaire College and at the University of Buenos Aires Faculty of Law, where he received the Doctor of Laws degree in 1903, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. After study in Paris and travel abroad, he accepted a professorship in law and constitutional history at the University of La Plata, where he began the teaching career that was to span more than forty years. Later, he inaugurated a course in sociology at the University of Buenos Aires, taught political economy and constitutional law in the Law School of the university, and eventually served as the rector of the university.

Saavedra Lamas was a leading Argentine academician in two areas. A pioneer in the field of labor legislation, he edited several treatises on labor legislation in Argentina and on the need for a universally recognized doctrine on the treatment of labor - among them, &quot;Centro de legislación social y del trabajo&quot; (1927) (Center of Social and Labor Legislation), &quot;Traités internationaux de type social&quot; (1924), &quot;Código nacional del trabajo&quot; (three volumes, 1933) (National Code of Labor Law). In the arena of practical affairs, Saavedra Lamas drafted legislation affecting labor in Argentina, supported the founding of the International Labor Organization in 1919, and presided over the ILO Conference of 1928 in Geneva while serving simultaneously as leader of the Argentine delegation.

In international law, his other field of major scholarly interest, he published &quot;La Crise de la codification et de la doctrine Argentine de droit international&quot; (1931); and he spoke, wrote, or drafted legislation on many subjects with international ramifications - among them, asylum, colonization, immigration, arbitration, and international peace. His brief Vida internacional, which he wrote at the age of seventy, is an urbane by-product of all this study and experience.

Saavedra Lamas began his political career in 1906 as director of Public Credit and then became the secretary-general for the municipality of Buenos Aires in 1907. In 1908 he was elected to the first of two successive terms in Parliament. There he initiated legislation regarding coastal water rights, irrigation, sugar production, government finances, colonization, and immigration. His main interest, however, lay in foreign affairs. He provided leadership in saving Argentina&#x27;s arbitration treaty with Italy, which almost foundered in 1907–1908, and eventually became the unofficial adviser to both the legislature and the foreign office on the analysis and implications of proposed foreign treaties. Saavedra Lamas though was also a controversial public figure as he was seen by the masses as an elitist patrician who was too conservative and favored British intervention, especially in railroad construction.

Appointed minister of Justice and Education in 1915, he instituted educational reforms by integrating the different divisions of public education and by developing a curriculum at the intermediate level for the vocational and technical training of manpower needed in a developing industrial country.

When General Agustín P. Justo became president of Argentina in 1932, he appointed Saavedra Lamas as foreign minister. In this post for six years, Saavedra Lamas brought international prestige to Argentina. He played an important role in every South American diplomatic issue of the middle thirties, induced Argentina to rejoin the League of Nations after an absence of thirteen years, and represented Argentina at virtually every international meeting of consequence during this period.

His work in ending the Chaco War between Paraguay and Bolivia (1932–1935) had not only local significance but generalized international importance as well. When he took over the foreign office, he immediately engaged in a series of moves to lay the diplomatic groundwork for a negotiated settlement of this dispute. In 1932 he initiated at Washington the Declaration of August 3 which put the American states on record as refusing to recognize any territorial change in the hemisphere brought about by force. Next, he drew up a Treaty of Nonaggression and Conciliation which was signed by six South American countries in October, 1933, and by all of the American countries at the Seventh Pan-American Conference at Montevideo two months later. In 1935 he organized mediation by six neutral American nations which resulted in the cessation of hostilities between Paraguay and Bolivia. Meanwhile, in 1934, Saavedra Lamas presented the South American Antiwar Pact to the League of Nations where it was well received and signed by eleven countries. Acclaimed for all of these efforts, he was elected president of the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1936.

After his retirement from the foreign ministry in 1938, Saavedra Lamas returned to academic life, became president of the University of Buenos Aires for two years (1941–1943), and rounded out his career as a professor for an additional three years (1943–1946).

Saavedra Lamas was known as a strict disciplinarian in his office, a logician at the conference table, a charming host in his home or his art gallery, and a man of sartorial elegance who wore, it is said, the highest collars in Buenos Aires. In addition to the Nobel Peace Prize, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor of France and analogous honors from ten other countries.

He died in 1959 at the age of eighty from the effects of a brain hemorrhage.

In March 2014 his solid gold Nobel medal was put up for auction after being found in a South American pawn shop.

In August 2014 a project for rebuying his Nobel medal by the Argentine Nation was presented at the Argentine congress. His auctioned medal was later won and is now owned by a private Asian collector.

<doc id="323751" wikidata="Q2546913" url="?curid=323751" title="Walter de Gray">
<text>Walter de Gray (died 1 May 1255) was an English prelate and statesman who was Archbishop of York from 1215 to 1255 and Lord Chancellor from 1205 to 1214. His uncle was John de Gray, who was a bishop and royal servant to King John of England. After securing the office of chancellor, the younger Gray was a supporter of the king throughout his struggles and was present at the signing of Magna Carta in 1215. After two unsuccessful elections to a bishopric, he became Bishop of Worcester in 1214 but soon after moved to York. During the reign of John&#x27;s son, King Henry III, Gray continued to serve the king while also being active in his archdiocese. He died in 1255 and was buried at York Minster, where his tomb still survives.

==Early life==
Gray was the son of John de Gray, of Eaton in Norfolk and nephew of John de Gray, Bishop of Norwich. His birth year is not recorded, nor is his age when he died, but according to the historian Lee Wyatt, Gray was probably born around 1180. This assumes that in 1214 he was at least 30, the earliest legal age for consecration as a bishop, which would mean he was not born after 1184. Likewise, it is unlikely he was much older than 80 when he died, which gives an earliest possible birth year of 1175. He heard Edmund of Abingdon lecture at University of Oxford, although it does not appear that he was granted a degree.

==Royal service under John==
Gray was a favourite of King John of England, who appointed him Lord Chancellor in 1205; in return, Gray paid John 5,000 marks for the office. In 1209, Gray was one of the king&#x27;s supporters who helped delay the promulgation in England of the papal bull declaring John excommunicated. Gray accompanied the king to Dover in May 1213 when the king issued a royal charter whereby John became a papal vassal, although Gray did not appear as a witness on the charter. A story was later told that he refused to affix his chancellor&#x27;s seal to the charter, but this is a later invention. In late 1213 Gray went to Flanders, relinquishing custody of the great seal until his return in January 1214.

Gray was elected Bishop of Lichfield in 1210. John was so determined to secure Gray&#x27;s election, that one of John&#x27;s knights locked the cathedral chapter into a room, supposedly telling them that they would not be released until Gray was selected. His election was set aside by Pandulf Verraccio, the papal legate. A second election to the see was also unsuccessful in 1213.

Gray was then elected Bishop of Worcester on 20 January 1214, after resigning as chancellor in October 1214. His consecration as bishop took place on 5 October 1214. Gray was present at the issuing of Magna Carta in June 1215, and then once more travelled outside England, this time recruiting mercenaries for the king.

Gray was elected Archbishop of York on 10 November 1215 through the influence of John and Innocent III. John had wanted Walter, but the canons of York felt that Walter was ill-educated, and elected Simon Langton, brother of Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury. John objected, and wrote to Innocent III complaining of the election of the brother of one of his staunchest enemies, with which Innocent agreed. Innocent was said to have finally decided to give York to Gray because of Gray&#x27;s virginity, which the pope was said to have declared a great virtue for Gray. However, Gray eventually paid more than 10,000 pounds to the pope in various fees to get his election confirmed. Gray was attending the Fourth Lateran Council when he secured the papal assent to his translation to York and received his pallium at the council.

==Royal service under Henry III==
Gray was present at John&#x27;s death and supported the papal legate, Guala Bicchieri, who excommunicated all those opposed to the new king, Henry III, who was still a minor. John had faced an invasion from Prince Louis of France, who had been brought into the kingdom by rebellious English barons. Louis continued to try to seize the throne even after John&#x27;s death.

Gray was an important royal official during the minority of Henry, who often posted him as a diplomatic envoy. Gray performed the marriage ceremony of Henry&#x27;s sister Joan to King Alexander II of Scotland in 1221. In 1238 Gray mediated between the papal legate Otto of Tonengo and the University of Oxford, and eventually secured a pardon for the university due to its role in the dispute. Henry also named Gray as guardian of England when the king went to France in 1242. In 1252, Walter hosted King Henry and King Alexander III of Scotland for the Christmas feasts at York, which event cost the archbishop 2,500 pounds.

==As archbishop==
Gray attempted to assert his archiepiscopal authority over Scotland, which was not only resisted by the Scots but by the Archbishops of Canterbury. Gray had little success in defending his rights to Scotland against either adversary. He also clashed with successive Archbishops of Canterbury over the right of the Archbishops of York to have symbols of their archiepiscopal authority displayed when visiting the archdiocese of Canterbury. This dispute eventually kept Gray from King Henry&#x27;s second coronation in 1220.

Gray&#x27;s episcopal acta are the first to survive at York. They exist in two rolls, and this form may have been inspired by his experience with the chancery. Gray set up vicarages in his archdiocese, inspected the monasteries under his episcopal authority, and worked to improve the finances of his cathedral chapter. He also gave vestments and altar equipment to his cathedral. Gray purchased the village of Bishopthorpe, which became the residence of the archbishops. At Westminster, he purchased a house in 1244 that became York Place. He also endowed the church at Ripon, and translated the relics of Saint Wilfrid to a new shrine at Ripon. Besides Ripon, he also gave to the construction of the churches at Beverley and Southwell.

During his episcopate, both the north and south transepts of York Minster were constructed. Work on the south transept began by 1225 and on the north one by 1234. Work may have finished by 1251, although the records are sparse and do not allow for an exact date of completion. Traditionally, the south transept has been ascribed to Gray&#x27;s patronage, although there is no direct evidence for this, merely the location of his tomb within that transept. The north transept was funded by John le Romeyn, the treasurer of the cathedral chapter and a close friend of Gray&#x27;s. The motive for the construction of new transepts is not known for certain, but Lawrence Hoey speculated that a need to put the shrine of the local saint – William of York – into a grand setting, the need to replace the previous transepts, and the ambition of Romeyn and Gray to display their wealth and power.

Gray held a series of councils in his diocese from 1241 to 1255 which endeavoured to enforce clerical celibacy, keep benefices from being inherited, and improve the education and morals of the clergy. In 1221 Pope Honorius III wrote to Gray and ordered the archbishop to stop the practice of clerical marriage and enforce clerical celibacy in his archdiocese. The pope threatened unspecified admonitions if his commands were not met.

==Death and legacy==
In 1255 Gray visited London to attend a meeting of parliament, and died at Fulham on 1 May 1255. He was buried on 15 May 1255 at York Minster, His tomb still stands in the south transept, and is constructed of purbeck marble, and is thought to be the first canopied tomb in England. The tomb was restored in 1967–1968 and the coffin was opened, where a painted effigy was discovered on the coffin lid. Buried with Gray&#x27;s skeleton was a chalice, a paten which had been used as a lid for the chalice, a ring, and his crozier. His vestments and other textiles had mostly decayed, but a cushion that had been under his head and two other strips of cloth were still extant. These textiles, along with the metal objects, were removed before the coffin was resealed.

Four nephews of Gray were also clerics: William Langton (or Rotherfield) was Dean of York before being elected Archbishop of York but never consecrated, and Walter le Breton, Walter de Gray, and Henry de Gray, who were canons of York. Other more distant kinsmen continued to hold clerical and ecclesiastical offices throughout the 13th and early 14th centuries. Walter Giffard, a later Archbishop of York, was also a relative of some degree that is not precisely known.

<text>New England is a geographical region in the north of the state of New South Wales, Australia, about inland from the Tasman Sea. The area includes the Northern Tablelands (or New England Tablelands) and the North West Slopes regions. As of 2021, New England had a population of 185,560, with over a quarter of the people living in the area of Tamworth Regional Council.

==History==
The region has been occupied by Indigenous Australians for tens of thousands of years, in the west by the Kamilaroi people. In the highlands, the original languages (which are now extinct) included Anaiwan to the south of Guyra and Ngarbal to the north of Guyra. The population of the tablelands has been estimated to be 1,100 to 1,200 at the time of colonisation – quite low in comparison to the Liverpool Plains and Gwyder River region, estimated to be 4,500 to 5,500. Conflict, disease and environmental damage caused the tablelands population to be reduced to 400 by the 1890s.

The first European to explore the New England area was English explorer John Oxley, who crossed the southern part of the New England Range near the Apsley Falls before he discovered and named Port Macquarie in 1818. In 1827 Allan Cunningham travelled north along the western edge of the Range until he reached the Darling Downs in Queensland. In 1831 Thomas Mitchell reached Wallamoul Station near Tamworth and explored to the Namoi River then followed it to Narrabri. Moving on, Mitchell found a deep, broad river which was the Gwydir. In 1832, Mitchell cut across the plains to the Gwydir River near Moree. The team then spent several weeks charting the tributaries between the Gwydir and the Barwon Rivers.

Hamilton Collins Sempill was the first settler in the New England area when he took up the &#x27;Wolka&#x27; run in 1832, establishing slab huts where &#x27;Langford&#x27; now stands close to Walcha. During the 1830s further squatters moved their sheep flocks onto the Northern Tablelands as they had been displaced by the Australian Agricultural Company, which dominated resources in the Hunter Valley. When the area was opened up for settlement in the 1830s, this led to the gazetting of nine pastoral districts. These districts had a small police force and a Commissioner of Crown Lands.

Australian red cedar (&quot;Toona ciliata&quot;) cutters moved into the headwaters of the Macleay River in the early 1830s to harvest the valuable trees. The ranges between Kempsey and Glen Innes yielded about in 1950.
Work commenced in 1838 with the use of convicts to build a road, then known as &quot;Major&#x27;s Line&quot;, across the Great Dividing Range to link the wool-growing settlement of Walcha with Port Macquarie. This road was later named the Oxley Highway.

On 22 May 1839 the New England District was gazetted thus: &quot;New England District: Bounded on the east by a line north by compass from the top of Werrikimber Mountain which is at the head of the Hastings River; on the south by a line west by compass from the top of Werrikimber Mountain to the Great Dividing Range; on the west by the western extreme of the Great Dividing Range so as to include the Tableland and on the north the boundary is indefinite&quot;.

In 1840 there were 66 separate pastoral licences, in 1842 it rose to 98, 1845 – 116; and by 1848 there were 132. Only 10 new runs were registered between 1848 and 1855. In 1843 the Darling Downs district was separated from the New England.

This region ceased to be a statistical division after 1874, but the counties of Arrawatta, Clarke, Clive, Gough, Hardinge, Hawes, Sandon and Vernon approximated the region&#x27;s limits. In 1847 these counties, with the exception of Hawes and Vernon formed part of the &quot;Unsettled District&quot; of the colony. By 1850 all major communication routes had been forged, with little government assistance.

During the 1860s the famous bushranger, Captain Thunderbolt, robbed properties, mail coaches and hotels throughout the region. Thunderbolt was shot dead in May 1870 by Constable Walker at Kentucky Creek, near Uralla.

The population of the New England Region, including the slopes in 1957 was 143,788 and in 1971 there were 164,128 people, according to the census data. In the 2006 census the New England region had a population of 180,000 which included the local government areas of Armidale Dumaresq, Inverell, Walcha, Glen Innes Severn, Gunnedah, Guyra, Gwydir, Liverpool Plains, Moree Plains, Narrabri, Tamworth Regional and Uralla.

===Mining===
Gold was discovered in 1851 at Rocky River, approximately two kilometres west of Uralla and started a rush to the area. Then gold was found at Hanging Rock and nearby Swamp Creek in 1852. In the early 1850s some alluvial gold was found at Mulla Creek and Rywung (now Weabonga) on Swamp Oak Creek. In 1852 the first licenses to prospect were taken out. In the late 19th century several gold and antimony mines were established at places such as Halls Peak and Hillgrove, as well as two ambitious hydro-electric schemes to power them, the remains of which can be seen today along the Styx River and at Gara Gorge. The first gold mining was recorded at Tia in 1866 and in 1873 a reef was discovered at McLeod&#x27;s Creek, near Walcha. The discovery of the Torrington Tin Lode was made in 1881 but the small prospectors soon lost control to overseas mining companies. Tin and arsenic were mined from the 1880s at the Ottery Mine, near Emmaville. Copper was discovered at Gulf Creek, near Barraba, in 1889 and the first mine was established there in 1892. At its peak, in 1901, the copper mine was one of the largest in the state. Asbestos was first mined at Woodsreef, also near Barraba, from 1919 to the 1980s.

Mining had a major influence on the rise and fall of other towns and villages such as, Bingara, Bear Hill, Elsmore, Emmaville, Metz, Nundle, Stannifer, Tingha and Torrington.

===Railway service===
Construction of the Northern Tablelands railway service commenced in the 1870s and the Main North railway line reached Werris Creek and west Tamworth in 1878, Armidale in 1883 and Wallangarra on the Queensland border in 1888. The Main North railway line is now closed north of Armidale.

The Mungindi railway line from Werris Creek to Gunnedah opened in 1879, Narrabri in 1884 and Moree in 1897, Mungindi in 1914. The line is currently truncated to Weemelah between Moree and Mungindi. The line between Werris Creek and Moree is also known as the North-West line. A branch line was opened from Moree to Inverell in 1901. This line was closed in 1994. A branch line was opened between Camurra (11 km north of Moree) to North Star and Boggabilla in 1932 but it is now closed beyond North Star. Another branch was opened from Narrabri to Burren Junction in 1903.

===Natural disasters===
The major weather events in the region were:
* June 1950 – 1 person drowned in the flooded Barwon River, and 250,000 sheep were lost in the Moree area.
* October 1950 – 2 drowned in the Namoi area.
* February 1955 – nearly every home in Narrabri was flooded.
* February 1956 – 1 drowned in the flooded Peel River
* January 1962 – Walcha&#x27;s worst flood when 40 business houses and 39 residences were inundated.
* February 1971 – 5 killed, $25 million damage to stock and crops in the flooded Namoi area.
* January 1974 – Namoi flood area: $4 million property damage, $45 m roads and bridges. 500,000 sheep lost, worth $23m. $15m crop losses. $3 million beef cattle loss.
* September 1996 – A severe storm, with strong winds, heavy rain and hail, hit Armidale and caused widespread damage.
* November 2000 – The worst floods in half a century devastated Gunnedah, Narrabri and Wee Waa.
* November 2008 – Devastating damage occurred in the Tamworth, Somerton, Gunnedah and Weabonga areas after flash flooding.

==New England and its boundaries==
New England has no clearly defined boundaries, and the term has several possible definitions. These boundaries also vary according to the units responsible for services, including county councils, local government areas, electorates and the Livestock Health and Pest Authority (formerly the Pastures Protection Boards) etc. The New England region does not have a Bureau of Meteorology forecast as such, but the whole of the Northern Tablelands and part of the North West Slopes and Plains forecasts cover this region.

New England&#x27;s major settlements are Tenterfield, Inverell, Glen Innes, Moree, Armidale, Narrabri, Tamworth, Gunnedah, Quirindi and Wee Waa. Of these, Tamworth and Armidale are the major commercial areas, both with large shopping centres and tourist attractions. Of these, Inverell and Moree are considered semi-major towns.

The narrowest and most common definition of New England consists of the Northern Tablelands highland area which forms part of the Great Dividing Range, from the Moonbi Range in the south to the border of Queensland in the north. This tableland region is about long by approximately wide. It includes substantial areas more than above sea-level, with a distinctive cold climate and distinctive vegetation.

This highland region is often referred to as the New England Tableland, New England Plateau, or Northern Tablelands. There are widespread peaks over and the highest point at Round Mountain is above sea level. Other key peaks include Point Lookout at , Ben Lomond at , Mount Grundy at , Mount Hyland at , and Mount Duval at .

This definition of &quot;New England&quot; includes the towns and districts of Tenterfield, Glen Innes, Guyra, Inverell, Armidale and Walcha.

A broader definition of the New England Region covering , includes areas beyond the highlands which can also be considered to be the North West Slopes region and the Liverpool Plains. This definition is frequently known as New England North West or less commonly the Northern Region or Northern Inland Region and includes the western valleys of the Gwydir River and Namoi River and their tributaries, and the foothills and spur ranges which generally form the western side of the central Northern Tablelands. Towns and districts such as Moree, Narrabri, Gunnedah, the city of Tamworth and Quirindi, are included in the New England region according to this basis. Smaller towns include, Manilla, Barraba, Bingara, Boggabri, Mungindi, Wee Waa and Werris Creek. 
The two traditional centres of New England are Tamworth and Armidale. Armidale is home to the University of New England, one of Australia&#x27;s oldest universities. It also has large shopping centres and is the second largest city in the region. Tamworth is the bigger of the two, and is now best known as the centre of Australian country music and the home of the Australian Equine and Livestock Events Centre (AELEC) and Tamworth Regional Entertainment Centre (TREC). Other major towns and districts of New England include Narrabri, Moree, Glen Innes, Inverell, Tenterfield, Gunnedah and Walcha.

At its broadest definition, during the New England New State Movement the New England Region included the northern coastal lowlands of New South Wales, known as the Mid North Coast and Northern Rivers region, and including cities such as Lismore and Grafton. Several proposals were made for a new Australian state of New England and this included the North Coast region in the boundaries. Apart from this usage, the Mid North Coast and Northern Rivers region are not considered to be part of New England.

Police stations in New England Local Area Command (LAC) are Armidale, Ashford, Bundarra, Deepwater, Delungra, Emmaville, Glen Innes, Guyra, Inverell, Tenterfield, Tingha, Uralla and Yetman. Bendemeer, Nowendoc, Walcha and Walcha Road are in the Oxley LAC.

==Geography and ecology==
The topography of the region is dominated by the Northern Tablelands plateau. The eastern side of the plateau is drained by the various headwaters and tributaries of the Clarence River, Hastings River and the Macleay River. The eastern rivers are short and swift, and in many places form deep gorges and waterfalls. Notable waterfalls include the Apsley Falls at Walcha plus the Ebor Falls and Wollomombi Falls which are on Waterfall Way east of Armidale. These gorges fragment the eastern side of the plateau, which in some areas such as New England National Park and Point Lookout are quite close to the coast. There are many National Parks along the rugged eastern fringes of the highlands including Cathedral Rock National Park, which has the region&#x27;s highest peak, and Nymboida National Park.

The western side of the plateau is somewhat less rugged, and is drained towards the west by the tributaries of the Severn River, the Gwydir River and the Namoi River. These rivers form part of the Murray-Darling Basin. There are large dams at Copeton Dam on the Gwydir and at Keepit Dam, Chaffey Dam and Split Rock Dam in the Namoi catchment, plus Pindari Dam on the Severn River. The Nandewar Range is a major western spur of the highlands, culminating in Mount Kaputar near Narrabri.

The hilltops of the Great Dividing Range are basalt from north of Uralla to Glen Innes, and the eastern slopes are the lighter &quot;trap&quot; soils. On the western slopes near Bendemeer, Bundarra, Kentucky and Tenterfield the country is granite, with extensive sandy loams. The New England Peppermint Grassy Woodland lies within the region.

The New England lies in the temperate zone, and the climate is generally free from extremes of heat and cold. The greatest heat is usually experienced in the north-west around Narrabri and Mungindi. Winter frosts are common on the Northern Tablelands and winter snow is not unusual in this area. The Northern Tablelands receives most of its rain between late summer and early autumn with an annual average rainfall of about 800 mm, with the eastern escarpment having falls of around 2,000 mm average.

===Flora===
Wattles (&quot;Acacias&quot;), native apples (&quot;Angophora floribunda&quot;), black sallee (Eucalyptus stellulata), Blakely&#x27;s red gum (Eucalyptus blakelyi), Hillgrove box (&quot;Eucalyptus retinens&quot;), New England blackbutt (&quot;Eucalyptus andrewsii&quot;), broadleaved New England stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus caliginosa&quot;), manna gum (&quot;Eucalyptus viminalis&quot;), New England peppermint (&quot;Eucalyptus nova-anglica&quot;), ribbon gum (&quot;Eucalyptus nobilis&quot;), silvertop stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus laevopinea&quot;) wild cherry and yellow box (&quot;Eucalyptus melliodora&quot;) and stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus caliginosa&quot;) trees are common across the Northern Tablelands. The river oak (&quot;Casuarina cunninghamiana&quot;) grows along many creeks and river beds on the eastern and western slopes.

Bolivia Hill and the adjacent nature reserve are the only recorded locations of the endangered Bolivia Hill boronia (&quot;Boronia boliviensis&quot;), Bolivia homoranthus (&quot;Homoranthus croftianthus&quot;), Bolivia Stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus boliviana&quot;), the shrub Bolivia Hill Pimelea (&quot;Pimelea venosa&quot;) and the vulnerable Bolivia wattle (&quot;Acacia pycnostchya&quot;).
The rare Hillgrove spotted gum (&quot;Eucalyptus michaeliana&quot;) can be found near Hillgrove and in parts of the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park.

On the Western Slopes Caley&#x27;s ironbark (&quot;Eucalyptus caleyi&quot;), McKie&#x27;s stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus mckiena&quot;), red stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus macrorhynca&quot;), river red gums (&quot;Eucalyptus camaldulensis&quot;), rough-barked apple (&quot;Angophora&quot;), silver-leaved ironbark (&quot;Eucalyptus melanophloia nophloia&quot;), tumbledown gum (&quot;Eucalyptus dealbata&quot;), white box (&quot;Eucalyptus albens&quot;) and white cypress pine (&quot;callitris columellaris&quot;) are commonly found.

Some of the invasive weeds and plants found in the New England region include:
* Blackberry (&quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot;), competes with desirable pastures and harbours pest animals.
* Bracken competes with desirable pastures and causes toxicity to stock.
* Lantana (&quot;Lantana camara&quot;), invades the bushland
* Mother of millions (Kalanchoe delagoensis) causes severe toxicity to stock
* Nodding thistle (Carduus nutans)
* Patterson&#x27;s curse (&quot;Echium plantagineum&quot;) competes with desirable pastures and causes toxicity to stock.
* Saffron thistle (Carthamus lanatus)
* Serrated tussock (&quot;Nassella trichotoma&quot;), competes with desirable pastures
* St John&#x27;s wort (&quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot;) competes with desirable pastures and causes toxicity to stock.

===Fauna===
Common animals that may be encountered across the New England region include: kangaroos, echidnas, wallabies, possums and wombats. Common birds are: cockatoos, currawongs, magpies, crows, wild ducks, galahs, parrots, kookaburras, ravens, rosellas and emus (on the western slopes). Snakes, lizards, jacky dragons (&quot;Amphibolurus muricatus&quot;) and goannas may also be encountered.

Endangered species that may be seen include the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (&quot;Petrogale penicillata&quot;) which may be spotted in isolated sections of Oxley Wild Rivers National Park. Bundarra is one of only three breeding areas in New South Wales for the endangered regent honeyeater. Werrikimbe National Park is the home of the rare (native) Hastings River mouse which was considered to be extinct until it was re-discovered in 1981. The Namoi River snapping turtle (&quot;Elseya belli&quot;) is a species of turtle found only in the upper reaches of the Namoi River, Gwydir River and Macdonald River.

The area is also known to have supported vast populations of Australian megafauna.

Pest animals in the New England region include, foxes, rabbits, feral goats and feral pigs.

==Economy==
The New England region has a great diversity of mineral deposits ranging from large coal deposits in the Werris Creek to Boggabri area to metallics and gemstones on the tablelands. Antimony, coal, gold, sapphires and tin have been the most important economic commodities mined in the New England region.

There are numerous other business activities across the region ranging from small enterprises to large multi-national corporations that are producing goods for domestic and international markets. Aviation training is provided by the Tamworth-based BAE Systems flight training college, the Australasian-Pacific Aeronautical College.

Cattle and sheep are the predominant types of livestock produced in the New England and they have been produced since their importation during the earliest days of European settlement. The Northern Tablelands produce some of Australia&#x27;s best fine wool and beef cattle. The western slopes are major areas for cotton and wheat. Other primary production activities include dairying, the production of grains, lamb, pork, fruit, potatoes, poultry, eggs, various mining activities, timber production, viticulture and aquaculture.

==Transport and communications==

The New England region is traversed by five major highways and a concentrated network of minor roads. On the tablelands the New England Highway, which links Tamworth, Uralla, Armidale, Guyra, Glen Innes and Tenterfield is a major route linking New South Wales and Queensland. The Newell Highway is a major route linking Victoria and Queensland through Narrabri and Moree. Thunderbolts Way from Gloucester provides the shortest route from Sydney to the New England and continues through Walcha, Uralla and Bundarra to Inverell. The Oxley Highway, Gwydir Highway, the scenic Waterfall Way and Bruxner Highway traverse the New England region from west to east. On Western Slopes the Kamilaroi Highway runs in a north-western direction for 620 km, from Willow Tree passing through Quirindi, Gunnedah, Narrabri and Wee Waa until it reaches Bourke. Fossickers Way is a tourist route that runs from Nundle to Warialda in the north and then east to Inverell and Glen Innes passing through some rich gem areas.

The major towns have air, coach and rail services that supplement the road network. The Main North railway line following the same route as the New England Highway to Wallangarra, Queensland was the first railway link between the states, however the coastal railway is now used and the New England line is disused north of Armidale. There is a daily passenger service from and to Sydney which extends to Moree in the north west and Armidale in the north. The train divides at Werris Creek.

==Education==
The New England region has a comprehensive range of educational facilities available, including 125 public schools.

Armidale is the home of the University of New England, Australia&#x27;s oldest regional university and was the location of the former Armidale Teachers College. Other Armidale schools include, New England Girls&#x27; School (NEGS), The Armidale School (TAS), Armidale Secondary College, O&#x27;Connor Catholic College and Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College. Calala, near Tamworth, is the home of Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School, a public high school for boys. Calrossy Anglican School, Oxley High School, Peel High School, Tamworth High School and Tamworth Public School are the other principal schools that are located in Tamworth.

The New England Institute of TAFE has campuses in Tamworth, Armidale, Boggabilla, Glen Innes, Gunnedah, Inverell, Moree, Narrabri, Quirindi and Tenterfield.

==Health services==
On 25 August 2000, the New England North West Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service (WRHS) commenced operation after four years of fundraising and planning. The New England North West WRHS operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with an annual average of 130 missions.

==National parks==
There is a wide range of 27 main national parks and over 30 nature reserves in the New England area of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service region, plus Mount Kaputar National Park which is in the Central Region. National parks including World Heritage listed areas that form part of the Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves (CERRA), gorge country and wild rivers on the rugged eastern fringe of the region include:

* Cathedral Rock National Park which includes the highest peak in the region, Round Mountain
* Guy Fawkes River National Park
* New England National Park
* Oxley Wild Rivers National Park
* Washpool National Park
* Werrikimbe National Park

==New State Movement==
New England has been the home of Australia&#x27;s most persistent attempt to form a new state within the Australian commonwealth. In the 1930s and again in the 1960s, the New England New State Movement campaigned for New England to be separated from New South Wales. The movement was closely allied with the Country Party, which could have expected to form the government of such a new state.

On 29 April 1967, a referendum in the region on the creation of a new state in northern NSW returned a &#x27;no&#x27; vote of 54%, although the forced inclusion of the City of Newcastle, which is not a part of New England, was the major contributing factor that led to the &#x27;no&#x27; vote.

Chapter VI of the Constitution of Australia allows new states to be formed, but only with the consent of the Parliament of the state in question.

<text>The Italian city-states were numerous political and independent territorial entities that existed in the Italian Peninsula from antiquity to the formation of the Kingdom of Italy in the late 19th century.

The ancient Italian city-states were Etruscan (Dodecapolis), Latin, most famously Rome, and Greek (Magna Graecia), but also of Umbrian, Celtic and other origins. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, urban settlements in Italy generally enjoyed a greater continuity than settlements in western Europe. Many of these cities were survivors of earlier Etruscan, Umbrian and Roman towns which had existed within the Roman Empire. The republican institutions of Rome had also survived. 

Some feudal lords existed with a servile labour force and huge tracts of land, but by the 11th century, many cities, including Venice, Milan, Florence, Genoa, Pisa, Lucca, Cremona, Siena, Città di Castello, Perugia, and many others, had become large trading metropoles, able to obtain independence from their formal sovereigns. Some of these cities grew in importance and became duchies and maritime empires.

==Antiquity==
The cities of Magna Graecia and of Etruria are among the earliest examples of city-states in Italy. The Latin settlement of Rome also was a city-state, founded in the 753 BC. Rome eventually created many colonies and &quot;municipi&quot; on earlier Etruscan, Umbrian, or Celtic settlements throughout Italy. The network of Roman cities in Italy survived the fall of the Western Roman Empire and provided the basis for the re-emergence of city-states in the Medieval period.

==Medieval and modern period==

Among the earliest medieval city-states of Italy, that already started to emerge in the 7th century, were the Duchy of Naples, Duchy of Amalfi, Gaeta and the Republic of Venice which, although nominally under Byzantine control, were effectively independent. The Duchy of Spoleto and the Duchy of Benevento were under Lombard control.

===Communes===
The other early Italian city-states to appear in northern and central Italy arose as a result of a struggle to gain greater autonomy during the rule of the Holy Roman Empire. The Lombard League was an alliance that included at its apex most of the cities of northern Italy including Milan, Piacenza, Cremona, Mantua, Crema, Bergamo, Brescia, Bologna, Padua, Treviso, Vicenza, Verona, Lodi, Reggio Emilia and Parma, although its membership changed through time. Other city-states were associated to these &quot;commune&quot; cities, like Genoa, Turin and, in central Italy, the city states of Florence, Pisa, Lucca, Siena, Ancona, Città di Castello, Perugia, Terni, Assisi among others.

===Duchies===
South of Rome and the Papal States were the duchies of Salerno, Amalfi, Duchy of Naples and Duchy of Gaeta. Other independent cities were Bari and Trani, which in 1130 were united in the newly created Norman Kingdom of Sicily.

===Maritime republics===

Amalfi, Gaeta and Venice in the 11th century were already autonomous maritime republics. Around 1100, Genoa, Pisa and Ancona emerged as independent maritime republics too: trade, shipbuilding and banking helped support their powerful navies in the Mediterranean in those medieval centuries.

==Difference from northern Europe==

Between the 12th and 13th centuries, Italy was vastly different from feudal Europe north of the Alps. The Peninsula was a of political and cultural elements, not a unified state.

The very mountainous nature of Italy&#x27;s landscape was a barrier to effective inter-city communication. The Po plain was an exception: it was the only large contiguous area, and most city states that fell to invasion were located there. Those that survived the longest were in the more rugged regions, such as Florence or Venice, which was protected by its lagoon. 

The rugged terrain of the Alps prevented the Holy Roman Emperors or various German princes and lords from attacking the northern part of Italy, safeguarding the country from permanent German political control. Largely for these reasons, no strong monarchies emerged as they did in the rest of Europe. Authority of the Holy Roman Empire over northern Italian territory, especially after the year 1177, was &quot;de facto&quot; only nominal. Instead emerged the autonomous (sometimes &quot;de facto&quot; independent) city-states.

While those Roman, urban, republican sensibilities persisted, there were many movements and changes afoot. Italy first felt the changes in Europe from the 11th to the 13th centuries. Typically there was:
* a rise in population―the population doubled in this period (the demographic explosion)
* an emergence of huge cities (Venice, Florence and Milan had over 100,000 inhabitants by the 13th century in addition to many others such as Genoa, Bologna and Verona, which had over 50,000 inhabitants)
* the rebuilding of the great cathedrals
* substantial migration from country to city (in Italy the rate of urbanization reached 20%, making it the most urbanized society in the world at that time)
* an agrarian revolution
* the development of commerce

==Income==
It is estimated that the per capita income of northern Italy nearly tripled from the 11th century to the 15th century. This was a highly mobile, demographically expanding society, fueled by rapidly expanding commerce.

In the 14th century, just as the Italian Renaissance was beginning, Italy was the economic capital of Western Europe: the Italian States were the top manufacturers of finished woolen products. With the Bubonic Plague in 1348, the birth of the English woolen industry, and general warfare, Italy temporarily lost its economic advantage. By the late 15th century Italy was again in control of trade along the Mediterranean Sea. It found a new niche in luxury items like ceramics, glassware, lace and silk as well as experiencing a temporary rebirth in the woolen industry.

Italy never regained its strong hold on textiles. Though it was the birthplace of banking, by the 16th century German and Dutch banks began taking away business. The discovery of the Americas as well as new trade routes to Africa and India by the Portuguese, which made Portugal the leading trading power, brought about the shift of economic power from Italy to Portugal in the 16th century, from Portugal to the Netherlands in the 17th century, and from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom in the 18th century.

==Literacy and numeracy==
By the 13th century, northern and central Italy had become the most literate society in the world. More than one-third of the male population could read in the vernacular (an unprecedented rate since the decline of the Western Roman Empire), as could a small but significant proportion of women.

The Italian city states were also highly numerate, given the importance of the new forms of bookkeeping that were essential to the trading and mercantile basis of society. Some of the most widely circulating books, such as the &quot;Liber Abaci&quot; by Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa, included applications of mathematics and arithmetic to business practice or were business manuals based on sophisticated numeracy. 

Indeed, Luca Pacioli helped create the banking system of the Italian city-states with double-entry bookkeeping. His 27-page treatise on bookkeeping contained the first known published work on that topic, and is said to have laid the foundation for double-entry bookkeeping (of Genoese merchants) as it is practised today.

==Communes==
During the 11th century in northern Italy a new political and social structure emerged: the city-state or commune. The civic culture which arose from this &quot;urbs&quot; was remarkable. In some places where communes arose (e.g. Britain and France), they were absorbed by the monarchical state as it emerged. They survived in northern and central Italy as in a handful of other regions throughout Europe to become independent and powerful city-states. 

In Italy the breakaway from their feudal overlords occurred in the late 12th century and 13th century, during the Investiture Controversy between the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor: Milan led the Lombard cities against the Holy Roman Emperors and defeated them, gaining independence (battles of Legnano, 1176, and Parma, 1248; see Lombard League).

Some Italian city-states became great military powers very early on. Venice and Genoa acquired vast naval empires in the Mediterranean and Black Seas, some of which threatened those of the growing Ottoman Empire. During the Fourth Crusade (1204), Venice conquered three-eights of the Byzantine Empire.

The Maritime Republics were one of the main products of this new civic and social culture based on commerce and exchange of knowledge with other areas of the world outside western Europe. The Republic of Venice and the Republic of Genoa for example, had important trade communications with the Muslim and Byzantine world and this helped the initial development of the Italian Renaissance.

By the late 12th century, a new and remarkable society had emerged in Northern Italy; rich, mobile, expanding, with a mixed aristocracy and urban &quot;borghese&quot; (burgher) class, interested in urban institutions and republican government. But many of the new city-states also housed violent factions based on family, confraternity and brotherhood, which undermined their cohesion (for instance the Guelphs and Ghibellines).

==Princely states==
By 1300, most of these republics had become princely states dominated by a Signore. The exceptions were the Republics of Venice, Florence, Genoa, Lucca, and a few others, which remained republics in the face of an increasingly monarchic Europe. In many cases by 1400 the Signori were able to found a stable dynasty over their dominated city (or group of regional cities), obtaining a nobility title of sovereignty by their formal superior. For example in 1395 Gian Galeazzo Visconti bought the title of Duke of Milan from the King Wenceslaus for 100,000 gold florins.

==Regional states==
In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Milan, Venice, and Florence were able to conquer other city-states, creating regional states. The 1454 Peace of Lodi ended their struggle for hegemony in Italy, attaining a balance of power (see Italian Renaissance).

At the beginning of the 16th century, apart from some city-states like Genoa, Lucca or San Marino, only the Republic of Venice was able to preserve its independence and to match the European monarchies of France and Spain and the Ottoman Empire (see Italian Wars).

<text>Pierre-Jean de Béranger (; 19 August 1780 – 16 July 1857) was a prolific French poet and chansonnier (songwriter), who enjoyed great popularity and influence in France during his lifetime, but faded into obscurity in the decades following his death. He has been described as &quot;the most popular French songwriter of all time&quot; and &quot;the first superstar of French popular music&quot;.

Some newspapers from Malaysia and Seychelles mention that he was the retrospective composer of Allah Lanjutkan Usia Sultan, the anthem of the peninsular sultanate of Perak whose melody was later adopted for Malaysia&#x27;s national anthem Negaraku; as well as the pre-independent Nusantaran folk song Terang Bulan, but there is argument on whether he ever wrote any melody throughout his life.

==Biography==
===Early life and career, 1780–1803===

Béranger was born at his grandfather&#x27;s house on the Rue Montorgueil in Paris, which he later described as &quot;one of the dirtiest and most turbulent streets of Paris&quot;. He was not actually of noble blood, despite the use of an appended &quot;de&quot; in the family name by his father, who had vainly assumed the name of &quot;Béranger de Mersix&quot;. He was, in fact, descended from more humble stock, a country innkeeper on one side of the family and a tailor on the other—the latter was later celebrated in a song, &quot;Le tailleur et la fée&quot; (The tailor and the fairy). He made much of his humble origins in &quot;Le Villain&quot; (The Plebeian):

As a child he was shy and sickly, but skilful with his hands and learnt to carve cherry stones. He was sent to school in the faubourg St. Antoine, and from its roof witnessed the storming of the Bastille in 1789, which was commemorated in his poem, &quot;Le quatorze juillet&quot; (The 14th of July). His father had been a business agent, but his royalist sympathies meant that he had to go into hiding after the French Revolution. Pierre-Jean was therefore sent to live with an aunt in Péronne, in Somme, who ran an &quot;auberge&quot; (boarding house). His aunt apparently taught him republican principles, and from her doorstep he heard the guns at Valenciennes (during the War of the First Coalition); he also developed a passionate love of France and distaste for all things foreign.

He attended a school in Péronne, &quot;L&#x27;Institut Patriotique&quot;, founded by &quot;M. Ballue de Bellenglise&quot;, one time deputy of the legislative assembly, which was run according to the educational principles of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Here, the boys were organised into clubs and regiments, and taught to play at politics and war. Béranger was president of the club, made speeches before such members of the National Convention as passed through Péronne, and composed addresses to Jean Lambert Tallien and Robespierre.

Neither Greek nor Latin was taught at his school—nor even French language by all accounts, for it was only after he left school that he acquired the elements of grammar from a printer, in Péronne, called Lainez, with whom he served an apprenticeship from the age of 14 years of age (after a spell as a waiter, for his aunt). It was there that he acquired a taste for verse. Although he could never read Horace in the original, he had an acquaintance with Fénelon&#x27;s &quot;Télémaque&quot;, Racine and the dramas of Voltaire.

After spending some time in Laisnez&#x27;s printing-office, he was called to Paris, in 1796, to serve as an assistant in his father&#x27;s business. In 1798, the firm went bankrupt, and Beranger found himself in straitened circumstances, though he now had more time to compose verse. Poems such as &quot;Le Grenier&quot; (The Garret) and &quot;Mon Habit&quot; (My Coat) belong to this period. He did literary hackwork, and wrote pastorals, epics and other works. However, by the end of 1803, Béranger was in direst poverty and poor health. His wardrobe consisted of one pair of boots, one greatcoat, one pair of trousers with a hole in the knee, and &quot;three bad shirts which a friendly hand wearied itself in endeavouring to mend.&quot; The friendly hand was that of &quot;Judith Frere&quot;, whom he had known since 1796, and who continued to be his faithful companion until her death, three months before his own. She was not the &quot;Lisette&quot; referred to in his songs, but &quot;was&quot; the inspiration behind &quot;La Bonne Vieille&quot; and &quot;Maudit printemps&quot;.

===Success, 1804–1821===

Out of desperation Beranger wrote a letter to Lucien Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon, enclosing some of his work. Lucien Bonaparte took an interest in the young poet, even transferring to him his own pension of 1000 francs from the Institut de France, and persuaded him to write a poem on the &quot;Death of Nero&quot;. Five years later, in 1809, through the same patronage, but indirectly, he became a despatch clerk at the Imperial University of France, at a salary of an additional thousand francs. Now his life began to take on a more regular shape.

Meanwhile, he had written many songs for convivial occasions, and &quot;to console himself under all misfortunes&quot;; some had apparently already been published by his father, but he set no great store on them himself; and it was only in 1812, while keeping a sick friend company, that it occurred to him to write down the best of them. The following year he was elected to the Caveau Moderne, and his reputation as a songwriter began to spread. Manuscript copies of &quot;Les Gueux&quot;, &quot;Le petit homme gris&quot;, &quot;Le Sénateur&quot;, and, above all, of &quot;Le Roi d&#x27;Yvetot&quot;, a satire against Napoleon, passed from hand to hand, were spoken and sung, achieving both popularity and acclaim. Around this time, also, he made the acquaintance of the well-known songwriter, Désaugiers.

The disastrous events of the Napoleonic wars, with the invasion of France by allied armies, the surrender of Paris in 1814, and, finally, the defeat at Waterloo in 1815, had a deep effect on Béranger, and gave a new stimulus and direction to his poetic output. After the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, he turned his pen against the establishment, opposing the antinationalist tendencies of the government, revolting against the absurdities of the day and celebrating the former glories of the republic. He became the national poet of France.

Béranger&#x27;s first volume of poetry (&quot;Chansons morales et autres&quot;) appeared in 1815, and though it contained few political pieces, it aroused the suspicion of the department in which he worked due to its popularity; he was advised by his chief not to publish any similar material in the future. The advice went unheeded and Béranger issued another volume in 1821, by which time he had resigned from his regular employment.

===Imprisonment===

The second volume of songs enjoyed huge sales, but also attracted judicial proceedings; Béranger&#x27;s subsequent trial and conviction resulted in a fine of 500 francs and 3 months in Sainte-Pélagie Prison, though, from all accounts, his accommodation &quot;inside&quot; was actually more comfortable than the poor lodgings he had previously had to suffer on the &quot;outside&quot;. Even in jail he continued to compose, producing songs such as, &quot;&quot;Les Adieu à la Campagne&quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;La Chasse&quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;L&#x27;Agent Provocateur&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Mon Carnaval&quot;.

Béranger&#x27;s third collection went unpunished, but his 4th volume, published in 1828, was severely dealt with, the author being fined 1,100 francs and sentenced to nine months in La Force Prison. This was after the government had offered him a minimal penalty if he would offer no defence to the charges; Béranger, of course, refused the offer, not even asking for the option of passing his term in a &quot;Maison de santé&quot;, the French equivalent of an English madhouse.

===The height of his career===
This was the most brilliant period of Béranger&#x27;s career. He had influence among the opposition to the government; his advice was sought for and respected; his even-handedness, his love of freedom of speech, courtesy, lack of personal ambition, generous disposition, and marked sympathy for the young, all endeared him to the nation, and especially to the common people. A volume of his song lyrics was published in 1836, &quot;&quot;, illustrated with 100 wood engravings by the French illustrator J. J. Grandville.

His songs (such as &quot;Le Vieux Drapeau&quot;), helped to bring about the revolution of 1830, and he played a part, with his friends Lafitte and Lafayette, in placing Louis Philippe I upon the throne, but refused all the appointments proffered by the king and his ministers; he simply desired to live as a philosopher, content with the income from the sale of his songs, and preserving his personal independence. He did, however, ask for a pension for his friend, Rouget de Lisle, author of the Marseillaise, who was now old and poor, and had been dependent on him for five years. In 1833, his 5th volume of songs was published
After the French Revolution of 1848, and despite his own reluctance, he was elected to the Constituent Assembly by so large a number of votes (204,471) that he felt himself obliged to accept the seat. Not long afterwards, with great difficulty, he obtained leave to resign. This was the last public event of Béranger&#x27;s life.

===Retirement===
Béranger tried to live as quietly and privately as possible in retirement. He continued to polish his songs and had many illustrious visitors. He numbered among his friends Chateaubriand, Adolphe Thiers, Jacques Laffitte, Jules Michelet, Lamennais, Mignet. He was said to be amiable in character, ready to receive help when in need, but also ready to give help when needed by others. His correspondence is noted for its wisdom and kindness, reminiscent of Montaigne, and, occasionally, Charles Lamb.

It was in this period that he became a champion of the struggling artist Antoine Chintreuil, buying his work, paying for his supplies, and writing many letters of recommendation to collectors and connoisseurs.

He produced a book of memoirs, which was translated into English, and started work on a treatise, &quot;Social and Political Morality&quot;, which was left unfinished on his death. During his final illness, the street in which he lived was thronged with sympathisers and his death was an occasion for national sorrow and mourning. It was feared that the funeral would be the signal for some political disturbance; but the government took immediate measures, and all went quietly. The streets of Paris were lined with soldiers and full of townsfolk, silent and uncovered. From time to time cries arose: &quot;Honneur, honneur a Béranger!&quot;

==Songs==

Béranger has been described as &quot;the most popular French songwriter of all time&quot;, and it is certainly true that, in the 19th century, no nation had a lyricist whose influence on his fellow countrymen compared to that exercised by Béranger on the citizens of Paris. Like all chansonniers, he wrote lyrics but did not compose any music; he set the words to a pre-existing melody such as a folk tune. &quot;Le Roi d&#x27;Yvetot&quot;, for example, was sung to the traditional air &quot;Quand un tendron vient en ces lieux&quot;, while others might be set to well-known melodies by various composers.

The songs of Béranger are elaborate, written in a clear and sparkling style, full of wit and incision. It is not so much for any lyrical flow as for the happy turn of phrase that they claim merit. Whether the subject be happy or serious, light or passionate, the medium remains untroubled. The special merits of the songs are merits to be looked for more in English prose than in English verse. He worked deliberately, never writing more than 15 songs a year and often less, and was so fastidious that he threw away a quarter of his output.

&quot;I am a good little bit of a poet,&quot; Béranger said of himself, &quot;clever in the craft, and a conscientious worker to whom old airs and a modest choice of subjects (&quot;le coin que me suis confine&quot;) have brought some success.&quot; His modest self-appraisal belies his importance in literary history. When he first began to cultivate the chanson, it was a minor and little-regarded form, restricted to slight subjects and a humorous guise of treatment. Béranger raised the standing of the art and imbued it with greater sentiment.

From a comparatively early date, he resolved to write songs for the people. He was helped in this regard by Emile Debraux, who had often stood between him and the masses as interpreter, and given him the keynote of the popular humour. Now, he had observed in the songs of sailors, and workers, a prevailing tone of sadness; and so, as he grew more masterful in this sort of expression, he sought more and more after what is deep, serious and constant in the thoughts of common men. The evolution was slow; and we can see in his own works examples of every stage, from that of witty indifference in fifty pieces of the first collection, to that of grave and even tragic feeling in &quot;Les Souvenirs du peuple&quot; or &quot;Le Vieux Vagabond&quot;. And this innovation involved another, which was as a sort of prelude to the great romantic movement.

For the &quot;chanson&quot;, as he says himself, opened up to him a path in which his genius could develop itself at ease; he escaped, by this literary gateway, from strict academical requirements, and had at his disposal the whole dictionary, four-fifths of which, according to La Harpe, were forbidden to the use of more regular and pretentious poetry. If he still kept some of the old vocabulary, some of the old imagery, he was yet accustoming people to hear moving subjects treated in a manner more free and simple than before; so that his was a sort of conservative reform, preceding the violent revolution of Victor Hugo and his army of uncompromising romantics. He seems himself to have had glimmerings of some such idea; but he withheld his full approval from the new movement on two grounds: first, because the romantic school misused somewhat brutally the delicate organism of the French language; and second, as he wrote to Sainte-Beuve in 1832, because they adopted the slogan of &quot;Art for art,&quot; and set no object of public usefulness before them as they wrote. For himself (and this is the third point of importance) he had a strong sense of political responsibility. Public interest took a far higher place in his estimation than any private passion or favour. He had little toleration for those erotic poets who sing their own loves and not the common sorrows of mankind, who forget, to quote his own words, &quot;forget beside their mistress those who labour before the Lord.&quot; Hence it is that so many of his pieces are political, and so many, in the later times at least, inspired with a socialistic spirit of indignation and revolt. It is by this socialism that he becomes truly modern. and touches hands with Burns.

In Émile Gaboriau&#x27;s novel &quot;Monsieur Lecoq&quot;, published in 1868, Monsieur Lecoq finds that a prisoner is communicating with his confederate using a cipher based on Béranger&#x27;s poetry. It is noteworthy that in constructing the book&#x27;s plot, Gaboriau found it plausible to depict &quot;The songs of Béranger&quot; as the only book possessed by the prisoner.

<text>Pachydactylus is a genus of insectivorous geckos, lizards in the family Gekkonidae. The genus is endemic to Africa, and member species are commonly known as thick-toed geckos. The genus also displays rich speciation, having 58 distinct species identified when compared to other closely related gecko genera like &quot;Rhoptropus,&quot; most of which have emerged since 35Ma. It has been suggested that the reason for this rich speciation not from adaptive radiation nor nonadaptive radiation, but that the genus represents a clade somewhere between the two drivers of speciation. &quot;P. bibronii&quot; geckos have been used by NASA as animal models for experimentation.

==Description of the &quot;Pachydactylus&quot; genus ==
The genus &quot;Pachydactylus&quot; is characterized by dilated toe tips, usually with undivided scansors. Body scales are small, granular and non-overlapping, with scattered, large keeled tubercles.

Coloration of Pachydactylus species varies, but is generally drab in color.

Presence of adhesive toe pads varies by species and habitat, with rock dwelling species of &quot;Pachydactylus&quot; retaining adhesive pads, but unambiguous independent loss of toe pads in sand dwelling and burrowing species like &quot;P. rangei&quot;.

Body size in &quot;Pachydactylus&quot; varies across the 58 species, ranging from 35 to 115mm Snout-Vent Length (SVL) with the ancestral condition of a larger body size with adhesive toe pads to suit a generalist habitat.

==Behavior==
All observed species of &quot;Pachydactylus&quot; are strictly nocturnal. Wikibooks

==Habitat of &quot;Pachydactylus&quot; geckos==
&quot;Pachydactylus&quot; species live in a diverse range of habitats across Southern Africa. Habitat varies by species, with some species preferring generalist habitats, human dwellings, rock-dwellings, and sand dwellings. Habitat preference typically varies by body size and retention of toe pads, which varies across the genus. The body size of &quot;Pachydactylus&quot; geckos has been shown to correlate with their habitat range.

==Diet==
Lizards of the genus &quot;Pachydactylus&quot; feed mainly on arthropods, but have been observed eating small vertebrates.

==Geographic range==
The geographic range of the genus &quot;Pachydactylus&quot; is centered on Southern Africa, with some species reaching East Africa, the northernmost limit of their distribution. In South Africa&#x27;s rugged Richtersveld region, &quot;Pachydactylus&quot; geckos comprised 13 of 18 all gecko species surveyed.

<text>Bathurst () is a city in the Central Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. Bathurst is about 200 kilometres (120 mi) west-northwest of Sydney and is the seat of the Bathurst Regional Council. Founded in 1815, Bathurst is the oldest inland settlement in Australia and had a population of 44,621 in 2023.

Bathurst is often referred to as the Gold Country, as the area was the site of Australia&#x27;s first discovery of payable gold in 1851, and where Australia&#x27;s first gold rush occurred. Today education, tourism and manufacturing drive the economy. The internationally known racetrack Mount Panorama, also known as Wahluu, is a landmark of the city which brings in a lot of tourism, especially during the week of the Bathurst 1000. Bathurst has a historic city centre with many ornate buildings remaining from the New South Wales gold rush in the mid to late 19th century.

==History==
===Wiradjuri===
The area around what is now called Bathurst was originally occupied by the Muurrai clan of the Wiradjuri people. It was known as &quot;dalman&quot; or place of plenty. Yam fields were cultivated on the fertile floodplain and fire-stick farming was utilised to maintain grassy pasture for wild game. The Wiradjuri were noted by early colonists for their neat &quot;mandiyaba&quot; or possum-skin cloaks which were decorated with artistic etchings known as &quot;burwurr&quot;. British colonial settlement into this area began in 1815 and was expanded in 1818 when Governor Lachlan Macquarie removed restrictions that limited colonial settlements. Once these restrictions were removed the Wiradjuri people suffered major dislocation, death and disruption to their way of life.

===Early British colonisation (1815–1850)===

The government surveyor, George Evans, was the first European to sight the Bathurst Plains in 1813, following the first successful British crossing of the Blue Mountains in the same year. In 1814, Governor Lachlan Macquarie approved an offer by William Cox to build a road crossing the Blue Mountains, from Emu Plains to the Bathurst Plains. This road was wide and long, built between 18 July 1814 and 14 January 1815 using 5 freemen, 30 convict labourers and 8 soldiers as guards. Twenty convicts and soldiers remained stationed at terminus of the road at the Bathurst Plains. These were the first non-Indigenous residents of what was to become Bathurst but was simply referred to until May 7 of that year as the Grand Depot. Governor Macquarie surveyed the finished road in April 1815, travelling along it to the Grand Depot with his wife and an entourage of 50 officials, soldiers and servants.
On 7 May 1815, Governor Macquarie raised the British flag at the Grand Depot, ordered a ceremonial volley to be fired and named the military outpost as Bathurst after the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst. Bathurst thereby became the oldest inland British settlement in Australia. William Cox, who was appointed the first Commandant of Bathurst, and William Lawson were promised large grants of land in the area and soon sent herds of their livestock to the region.

The Bathurst region was opened up to wider British settlement in 1818 when Macquarie granted ten men of land each. These men were William Lee, Richard Mills, Thomas Kite, Thomas Swanbrooke, George Cheshire, John Abbott, John and James Blackman, John Neville and John Godden. These grants were located at what is now White Rock and Kelso. In 1818, Governor Macquarie stated in his diary:
This morning I inspected 10 new settlers for Bathurst. I have agreed to grant each 50 acres of land, a servant, a cow, four bushels [141 litres] of wheat, an allotment in the new town, and to receive into the King&#x27;s Store at Bathurst all the Wheat they can grow for the first 12 months.
In the early years of settlement, Bathurst was a base for many of the early explorers of the NSW inland, including George Evans in 1815, John Oxley in 1817–1818, Allan Cunningham in 1823, and Thomas Mitchell during the 1830s.

In 1819, frontier conflicts between local Wiradjuri groups and encroaching settlers began when Aboriginal people were shot and others mauled by the colonists&#x27; dogs. When Governor Brisbane opened the Bathurst area to wider colonisation from 1822, the subsequent large influx of graziers led to a more intense conflict over land and resources known as the Bathurst War. The Wiradjuri, led by leaders such as Windradyne, continued to resist settler encroachment until martial law was declared in August 1824, after which settlers conducted several raids against Wiradjuri settlements; colonists such as Theophilus Chamberlain, the superintendent for William Cox, perpetrated several massacres. In response, Major James Thomas Morisset was appointed commandant of Bathurst to restore order, conducting several sweeps across the landscape. Martial law ended in December 1824 as the remaining Wiradjuri were forced to make peace with the colonial authorities.

The Bathurst Rebellion occurred in late September 1830, when a large group of over 80 escaped convicts known as the Ribbon Gang roamed the Bathurst district, ransacking villages and engaging in shootouts over the course of three weeks. They were eventually captured and charged with murder, bushranging and horse-thieving. On 2 November 1830, ten members of the Ribbon Boys were hanged in Bathurst for their crimes. The site of the first and largest public hanging in Bathurst is still marked by the laneway sign &quot;Ribbon Gang Lane&quot; in the CBD.

===Gold rush era (1851–1860s)===
Bathurst became the first gold centre of Australia. Flecks of gold were first discovered in the Fish River in February 1823, but it was on 12 February 1851 in a Bathurst Hotel that Edward Hargraves announced the discovery of payable gold 26 miles (42km) north-west at the confluence of two creeks, a spot soon named Ophir. Further discoveries followed quickly nearby in Sofala and Hill End, and by the 1860s Bathurst&#x27;s economy was transformed by the discovery of the region&#x27;s gold and began to boom. The area&#x27;s fame grew even more in 1872 when Hill End became famous for Bernhardt Holtermann&#x27;s finding of the &#x27;Beyers-Holtermann Specimen&#x27;, this being the world&#x27;s largest specimen of native gold ever discovered, a record that still stands today.

One illustration of the prosperity gold brought to Bathurst is the growth and status of hotels and inns. The first licensed inn within the township was opened in 1835, the &quot;Highland Laddie&quot;. At the peak of hotel activity in 1875, coinciding with the gold rush period, there were 61 operating concurrently. A total of 89 hotel locations have been identified in the town of Bathurst, with 112 operating in the immediate district during the course of the history in Bathurst. Initially many pubs were simply a cottage with stables. As prosperity increased during the gold rush, the hotels became typical of architecture of pubs known today.
Bathurst&#x27;s position as a key transit point for transporting gold to Sydney made it an attractive target for bushrangers, causing a major problem for the authorities. Ben Hall, one of the period&#x27;s most notorious bushrangers, was married in St Michael&#x27;s Church at Bathurst in 1856. In October 1863, Hall and four other members of his gang raided Bathurst, robbing a jeweller&#x27;s shop, bailing up the Sportsmans Arms Hotel, and engaging the police in a shootout. They returned three days later and held up more businesses. A few members of the gang spent time in Bathurst Gaol, including Fred Lowry and John Peisley, who was hanged there for murder in 1862.

===Development to Federation (1860s–1910)===
The Cobb &amp; Co business was a horse drawn coaching transport business originally established in Victoria but relocated to Bathurst in 1862 to follow the gold rush. The business provided gold escorts, mail services and passenger services to the towns and rural settlements. Cobb &amp; Co. coaches were constructed in the coaching workshops located in Bathurst and the Bathurst Information Centre contains a restored Cobb &amp; Co. coach.

Bathurst later became the centre of an important coal-mining and manufacturing region. The Main Western railway line from Sydney reached Bathurst in 1876. From that time, the town became an important railway centre with workshops, crew base with locomotive depot and track and signal engineering offices. It remains today as the railway regional engineering headquarters with a large rail component manufacturing facility.
The heritage listed Bathurst Courthouse, a predominant landmark of the city centre, was constructed in 1880 based on designs by the New South Wales Colonial and Government architects, James Barnet and Walter Liberty Vernon.

In 1885, Bathurst had a population of about 8,000 and an additional 20,000 people in the district. The town in 1885 was a hub for stores such as E.G. Webb &amp; Co. with supplies and distribution occurring throughout large parts of western NSW and into Queensland and South Australia.

=== Early 20th century ===

This period is characterised by periods of slow to moderate population growth, with industrial and education industries developing and technology and services delivered to the town. Several major infrastructure developments arrive such as distributed town gas, electricity, town water supplies, and a sewage treatment system. Town gas had arrived in Bathurst courtesy of a private venture in 1872, with the Council providing a competing network from 1888. On 30 June 1914, the Council purchased the Wark Bros gas system and combined the gas networks. The old gasworks plant on Russell Street (now out of use) was built in 1960. In 1987 natural gas arrived via a new 240 km spur pipeline off the Moomba to Sydney pipeline. The early part of the century saw electricity arrive initially for street lighting; the city converted from gas street lighting to electric lighting on 22 December 1924, when 370 electric lights at a cost of £40,000 were switched on. Lighting spread along streets through to 1935, over time to businesses and finally private houses. Sewage treatment was an early infrastructure project funded by the state government and built in 1915. Water supply started with private wells in backyards. Eventually a waterworks was built to the south of the town on the river with the water pumped through piping laid progressively to the businesses and private dwellings. In 1931, work started on the 1,700 ML Winburndale Dam project to gravity feed water through a wood stave pipe laid to the town. The scheme was opened by the Premier of New South Wales on 7 October 1933. Later, a new larger water supply dam was built on the Campbells River. Originally known as the Campbell River Dam scheme and later renamed the Ben Chifley Dam after the late Prime Minister Ben Chifley of Bathurst. It was opened in November 1956. The Ben Chifley Dam received a major storage upgrade designed to meet the cities needs to 2050; the work was completed in 2001 increasing the capacity by 30% to .

An ambulance service commenced on 6 June 1925 with a new Hudson ambulance. A new ambulance station was opened 2 March 1929 and is still used by the NSW Ambulance Service. Motor cars were becoming common in the early 20th century and the need for road service patrols commenced in 1927, provided by the NRMA using a motorcycle/sidecar response vehicle. The early electronic media age arrived with the opening of commercial radio station 2BS on 1 January 1937. Bathurst Aerodrome was opened in 1942, initially to benefit the war effort providing parking for aircraft overflowing from Richmond air force base. The first commercial airline service departed for Sydney on 16 December 1946.

A famous Australian brand name of frozen foods began in Bathurst. Robert Gordon Edgell arrived in Bathurst in 1902. By 1906, he was growing pears, apples and asparagus and experimenting with canning and preserving fruit and vegetables, eventually opening a small cannery in 1926. In 1930, he formed the company Gordon Edgell &amp; Sons which became, and still is, a famous Australian food brand, now owned by Simplot.

Many attempts were made to start a university college, the earliest attempts were 1912 through to 1947 when real progress was made with plans for a state teachers college. The first intake of teacher students came at the beginning of 1951 with the official opening on 9 November 1951. The college has transformed over time into the Mitchell College of Advanced Education on 1 January 1970. The college grew and ultimately became the Charles Sturt University on 19 July 1989.

Bathurst was one of the locations to campaign to be the site of the new federal capital. In an essay prepared by a journalist with the &quot;Bathurst Times&quot;, Price Warung, in 1901 to promote Bathurst&#x27;s candidacy, he responds to the federal committees key requirements for the capital to have: &quot;centrality and accessibility of situation, salubrity, and capacity for impregnable defence&quot;. The proposed site for the capital city would have been slightly north-west of Bathurst, straddling the Macquarie River, at the locality known as Elrington.

=== World War II and Bathurst Migrant Camp ===
An Australian Army camp was established at Bathurst in early 1940, intended for the Second Australian Imperial Force&#x27;s 1st Armoured Division; however, it was later converted to an infantry training centre due to the unsuitability of the closely settled area to armoured training. Following World War II, the camp was converted to a migrant reception and training centre, with the first group of migrants arriving in 1948. At times the centre had up to residents at one time, taking in a total of around 100,000 migrants before its closure in 1952, when Villawood Migrant Centre was opened. Officially Bathurst Migrant Reception and Training Centre, it was usually referred to as Bathurst Migrant Camp.

===Population growth===
Bathurst&#x27;s population has had rapid growth periods throughout its history; during the mid to late 19th century gold rush period, then post World War 2 when migrants from the war ravaged countries were settled in the area and returning soldiers were offered farming land, and at the start of this century has been another fast growth period corresponding in part to Sydney&#x27;s congestion. Other periods have seen a slightly declining population, including the decade around the 1900s and during the 1960s. The following chart illustrates the growth from 1856 to recent times.
The median age of the city&#x27;s population is 35 years; which is particularly young for a regional centre (the state median is 38), and is related to the large education sector in the community. The city has had a moderate population growth of 1.29% year-on-year averaged over the five years until 2019, making Bathurst the tenth fastest-growing urban area in New South Wales outside Sydney. This growth over recent years has resulted in increased urban development, including retail precincts, sporting facilities, housing estates and expanding industrial areas.

==Geography==

Bathurst is located on the western edge of the Great Dividing Range in the Macquarie River plain; also known as the Bathurst plains.

The Macquarie River, which is part of the Murray-Darling basin, the largest river system in Australia, runs through the centre of the city. A number of levee banks have been erected in Bathurst to protect the region from occasional flood events.

Mount Panorama is located from the CBD and effectively within the city limits; it is AMSL and rises above the Bathurst CBD.

The Great Western Highway, which begins in the centre of the city of Sydney, ends at Bathurst. Two main state highways start at Bathurst: the Mitchell Highway to Bourke and the Mid-Western Highway to Hay. Bathurst is about mid-way along a regional road route from Canberra and Goulburn to Mudgee and the Hunter Region. Bathurst is also on the Main Western railway line that starts at Sydney Central and proceeds for by rail to Bathurst.

The Macquarie River divides Bathurst with the CBD located on the western side of the river. Four road bridges and two rail bridges span the river within the city area. From the upstream side they are: Macquarie River Railway Bridge (built in 1876) closed in 2011 (replaced with a new concrete single track rail bridge structure alongside and brought into use in 2011); the four lane Evans Bridge which opened in 1995; the Denison Bridge opened in 1870 (closed to road traffic and now a pedestrian bridge); the Gordon Edgell Bridge, a low−level bridge located on George Street; and Rankens Bridge at Eglinton.

===Landform===
Two physical components comprise the Bathurst region; the Bathurst Basin and the Tablelands areas. They are drained by the Macquarie, Turon, Fish and Campbells Rivers to the north and Abercrombie and Isabella Rivers to the south. The central basin area of the Bathurst area is mainly granite soils while in the north area sandstone, conglomerates, greywacke, siltstones, limestones and minor volcanos predominate. The south is more complex geology with siltstones, sandstones, greywacke, shales and chert, basalt and granite intrusions and embedded volcanic and limestones. Underlying Bathurst is the dominant feature of Bathurst granite (intruded in the Devonian period) and at Mount Panorama and Mount Stewart basalt occurs.

Topography of the region ranges from slightly undulating to rough and very steep country, about 30 km to the east of Bathurst is the folded and faulted sedimentary and metamorphosed formations of the Great Dividing Range which runs roughly north–south.

===Central Business District and suburbs===

Bathurst&#x27;s central business district (CBD) is located on William, George, Howick, Russell, and Durham Streets. The CBD is about in area and covers two city blocks. Banking, government services, shopping centres, retail shops, a park (shown) and monuments are in this area.

Bathurst has retained a mix of main street shopping along with enclosed shopping centres within the CBD, unlike other towns where the CBD focus has split between main street and new shopping centre developments located in the suburbs. Within the CBD lies Kings Parade; this is a park setting with several memorials of people and events in history. It is a popular location for locals to meet. Keppel Street is Bathurst&#x27;s second commercial shopping area, removed from the CBD by two blocks to the south. This area developed once the railway arrived in 1876. 

The main suburbs of Bathurst are: Kelso, Eglinton, West Bathurst, Llanarth, South Bathurst, Gormans Hill, Windradyne, Windradyne Heights and Abercrombie Estate. One of the newer suburbs is Marsden Estate, in Kelso.

===Climate===
Due to its elevation, Bathurst has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;), according to the Köppen climate classification. Bathurst is in Australia&#x27;s cool temperate zone, having warm summers and cool to cold winters with four distinct seasons. Regular spring and summer thunderstorms are common, resulting from the flat plains country to the west, leading into the mountainous nature of the country around Bathurst and assisting the development of storm cells. These storms do not often strike the city and instead move either in a south-east or north-east direction away from Bathurst. Bathurst gets 106.9 clear days annually.

In winter, light to moderate snowfalls occur each year on the high country around Bathurst, while snow is relatively rare in the city itself due to its low elevation at a northern latitude. On 5 July 1900, Bathurst received a freak snowfall measuring at in the main street. Bathurst is relatively dry year round, as it lay in a rain shadow on account of its sheltered valley location flanked by hills and ranges on all sides.

On 11 February 2017, Bathurst Ag recorded a new record high temperature of 41.5 °C (106.7 °F), although temperatures of 40 °C (104 °F) are exceedingly rare for Bathurst. There is a reading of 44.7 °C (112.5 °F) on 12 January 1878 at the Gaol, however such a reading may have been subject to overexposure. The highest minimum temperatures on record are on 14 January 1939, and on 20 November 1904. 

The lowest recorded temperature was on 31 July 1873; and the lowest maximum temperature was an extraordinary on 18 June 1877, which is the only known daily maximum below to have occurred in a major Australian city. Bathurst is one of only a handful of Australian towns to have recorded a sub-freezing maximum (others include Guyra and Nimmitabel), while at least one month has remained entirely free of air frosts, a trait common in broadly-temperate Laurasian (European, Asian, and North American) climates.

==Landmarks==
Bathurst&#x27;s place in Australia&#x27;s history is evidenced by the large number of landmark monuments, buildings, and parks.

In the centre of the city is a square known as Kings Parade. Originally a market area from 1849 to 1906 , it was redesignated as a public recreation ground and site for a soldiers memorial. Kings Parade now contains three memorials, an open space park and gardens.

The Bathurst War Memorial Carillon is a tall tower structure located in the centre of Kings Parade. The Parade is located in the centre of Bathurst&#x27;s CBD. The Carillon is a memorial to the soldiers who died in the two World Wars. The bell tower contains 49 bronze bells cast by John Taylor &amp; Co in 1928 that are rung daily at lunchtime, and an eternal flame on the platform level of the structure. The Carillon was officially completed on Armistice Day, 11 November 1933 at a cost of £8,000. It was upgraded in 2020 to standards, making it only the third such carillon in Australia.
The Evans memorial stands at the northern end of Kings Parade. Completed in 1920, the memorial commemorates the discovery of the Bathurst Plains in 1813 by George Evans, Assistant Surveyor of Lands.
The Boer War memorial stands at the southern end of Kings Parade. This memorial was unveiled in 1910 by Lord Kitchener.

==Governance==
===Local===
Local government was trialled in the new Colony with a &#x27;Bathurst and Carcoar District Council&#x27; established on 12 August 1843, Bathurst was proclaimed a town in 1852 and incorporated as a borough in 1862, next a municipality in 1883, then gazetted a city in on 20 March 1885. the same day as Sydney was declared a city. Bathurst Regional Council was formed on 26 May 2004 following the amalgamation of the Bathurst City Council, most of Evans Shire and a small amount of land formerly included in Oberon Shire.

===State===
The Electoral district of Bathurst is the state seat in the NSW Parliament. This seat covers the major centres of Bathurst and Lithgow, and all or part of Bathurst, Blayney, Cabonne, Lithgow, Mid-Western and Oberon local government areas.

Since 1859, Bathurst has existed as an electoral district in the NSW Parliament. Prior to 1856, Bathurst was a part of the Electoral district of Western Boroughs. Before the 1920s, Bathurst was a single member constituency, in the 1920s it became a multimember district with proportional representation. During the middle part of the 20th century the seat was marginal between Labor and Country Parties, from 1981 when the strong Labor town of Lithgow moved from Blue Mountains to Bathurst, the seat was dominated by Labor, except for 1988 when it was won by the Liberal Party for one 3-year term, and the 2011 election when Paul Toole of the National Party won the seat.

===Federal===

Bathurst is currently within the federal electoral district of Calare which includes a large part of western NSW from Lithgow in the east to Tullamore in the west. Prior to the 2010 election, Bathurst was within the Macquarie federal electoral district which was more easterly based including the Blue Mountains area with Bathurst as the western boundary of the district.

==Economy==
Bathurst&#x27;s economy is broad based with a manufacturing industry, large education sector (including agricultural) and government service sectors. In 2015, the Gross Regional Product was $1.96 billion representing 0.4% of the Gross State Product of New South Wales.

To capitalise on Bathurst&#x27;s growth, education facilities and youthful population, in 2011 the Regional Council announced it was progressing plans for a new Australian Centre for Science, Technology and Emerging Industries (ACSTEI), also known as the Technology Park, to be established adjacent to the Charles Sturt University Campus with the centre featuring next generation emerging industries.

===Manufacturing and food===
Private sector employers with large workforces in Bathurst (according to statistics published in 2009) include Devro, an international company that produces food casing products and Mars Petcare manufacturing plant are the single largest private employers of labour. Companies such as Telstra&#x27;s call centre, Simplot Australia&#x27;s (more recognisable as brands such as Edgells, BirdsEye, Chiko Roll, and I&amp;J Seafood products) food processing and canning plant and Burkes Transport a local trucking and distribution company. In 1982, Clyde Engineering opened a railway component facility in Kelso, initially producing electrical equipment under licence from Hitachi. In 1982 it began manufacturing locomotives. It closed in 2013.

===Public sector===
Government sector employers with large local workforces include Country Energy with their District Field Office and Corporate Office, Charles Sturt University, Bathurst Regional Council, the NSW Land Registry Services that provide mapping and survey data across NSW, the Western NSW Local Health District – Regional Office, Bathurst Correctional Centre, NSW Department of Education – Regional Office, New South Wales Police Force – Chifley Local Area Command, and NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service – Regional Office. In April 1982, the State Rail Authority opened a locomotive and wagon overhaul facility in Bathurst.

===Agriculture===
The Bathurst region&#x27;s climate of cool winter weather lends itself to stone fruit production and cool variety grapes suitable for wine production. 

Bathurst is the location for the Bathurst Primary Industries Centre, a government facility that has been operating since 1895 and originally known as The Experimental Farm. Originally established to study most facets of agriculture in the early growth years of the western inland, work included dairy, pigs, vegetable, cereal plantings, and fruit trees. The site is still one of the most important stone fruit research units in Australia.

Sheep and wool production are the main primary sector industries in the surrounding area with beef cattle a secondary production. Wool has been a significant part of the Bathurst rural scene since the 1850s when the industry was growing rapidly. Lambs for meat production are a common product of the region&#x27;s farms. Beef cattle breeds are predominantly British, British cross and European cross; the Bos indicus types are present but not common.

===Forestry===
Bathurst is the site of a major timber processing facility, which uses timber harvested from the surrounding forests. There are large plantations of softwood timber (pinus radiata) that are harvested for timber products; the main product being sawlogs, and some pulp. Bathurst is the headquarters for the Macquarie Region of Forestry Corporation of NSW (a NSW State Owned Corporation).

==Motorsport==
In the 21st century, Bathurst is known for motorsport, being the site of the Mount Panorama motor racing circuit. It hosts the Bathurst 12 Hour motor race each February, the Bathurst Motor Festival every Easter, and the Bathurst 1000 motor race each October. During these times, the population swells with tourists. The circuit is a public road when not being used for racing and is a popular tourist attraction for visitors to the city. Bathurst has a long history of racing, beginning with motorcycle racing from 1911. From 1931 to 1938, motorcycle racing was conducted at the Old Vale Circuit before moving to the newly created Mount Panorama Circuit in 1938. On 16 April 1938, Mount Panorama attracted 20,000 spectators to its first race, The Australian Tourist Trophy and in 2006 the crowd figure reached 194,000 for the 3-day Bathurst 1000 event.

A group known as &#x27;Mount Panorama Second Circuit Action Group&#x27; is promoting and lobbying to incorporate additional track and facilities into the existing circuit to capture additional events and increase the use of the facility.

Beside the circuit is the National Motor Racing Museum. This museum was built to encourage visitors to the circuit all year round and includes motor cycles and cars, representing the racing history of Bathurst. Peter Brock, the race car driver, was synonymous with Mount Panorama racing and a memorial sculpture dedicated to him, is located in the museum grounds.

==Sport==
Sports in general are well supported by the Bathurst community. The Bathurst Regional Council and NSW State Government have contributed significant funds over the past decade to build new facilities, such as a new heated Aquatic Centre, an Indoor Sports Stadium, Hockey Complex and major upgrade of the track, new pit complex and spectator facilities at the Mount Panorama circuit. The Hockey Complex is an advanced facility which includes water and sand based fields as well as numerous grass fields.

The city provides dedicated sports facilities for motor racing, Rugby League (part of Group 10), Rugby Union, Australian Rules, Athletics, Cricket, Netball, Tennis, Football and Touch Football. There are over 70 different sporting groups and organisations in the region from the Academy of Dance, croquet, aero, pony clubs, through to the football, rugby, cricket and cycling. Cycling is increasingly considered a speciality sport of the Bathurst Region with ideal road and community facilities around the city. The Bathurst Cycling Club is one of the oldest sports clubs in Australia founded in 1884.

==Bathurst region development==
Bathurst&#x27;s location close to Sydney and on major highways placed it in a desirable position for decentralisation plans by various governments over the years. Several decentralisation plans relating to Bathurst can be identified:

# in the late 1940s the Curtin Federal Government encouraged the NSW government to establish regions for regional development purposes. Bathurst and Orange were grouped as the Mitchell Region and established as such in 1945. Later the new Menzies federal government dropped support for the regionalisation scheme however the NSW Government continued, albeit modestly, promoting the regionalisation plan.
# on 3 October 1972 the Federal Government and New South Wales Governments agreed on a plan to introduce a decentralisation policy to various regions in NSW. This plan included a pilot growth centre in the Bathurst-Orange area and was known as the Bathurst Orange Development Corporation (BODC). Initially 13 areas were proposed, however only four were established with Bathurst-Orange and Albury-Wodonga the only in rural regional NSW. The project would comprise domestic, commercial and industrial developments and would develop the area economically, raise new capital investment, bring population to the region and create new employment opportunities. A statutory body was established by Act of Parliament to manage the BODC. The Act was effective from 1 July 1974. A key focus for the BODC was the purchase of land and to that end it purchased 209 properties around Bathurst valued at $22 million. A decline in regional trade as a result of changing global trends and the international depression and the oil shock during the mid-70s resulted in a declining interest by developers in new facilities. The BODC progressively received less and less government support and suffered liquidity problems. Several large new employers moved to Bathurst as part of the BODC initiative, including Devro, Uncle Bens (now Mars ), and Omya Minerals.
# In 1989, the Greiner government promoted the regional hub strategy that encouraged regional centres that had natural growth potential. Bathurst was one of 12 regional hub locations in NSW that received support funding for development of university expansions, administration, health and general education sectors.
# In 2010, a new plan to attract residents and therefore business to regional centres was launched. The marketing name is EVO Cities, a name coming from Energy, Vision and Opportunity (EVO). Seven NSW regional cities including Bathurst have developed the EVO City strategy at a local government level with funding provided by the NSW and Federal governments. The strategy largely relies on advertising in capital city markets to promote residents to relocate to the EVO Cities.

<doc id="323767" wikidata="Q882271" url="?curid=323767" title="Uroplatus">
<text>Uroplatus is a genus of geckos, commonly referred to as leaf-tail geckos or flat-tailed geckos, which are endemic to Madagascar and its coastal islands, such as Nosy Be. They are nocturnal, insectivorous lizards found exclusively in primary and secondary forest.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Uroplatus&quot;, is a Latinization of two Greek words: &quot;ourá&quot; (οὐρά) meaning &quot;tail&quot; and &quot;platys&quot; (πλατύς) meaning &quot;flat&quot;.

==Description==
Geckos of the genus &quot;Uroplatus&quot; are nocturnal and arboreal. They range in total length (including tail) from about for &quot;U. giganteus&quot; to for &quot;U. ebenaui&quot;. Larger species of &quot;Uroplatus&quot; are distinguished among geckos in having the largest number of marginal teeth among all living amniotes. Their distinctive laryngotracheal complex has been used to defend their monophyly. Other rare apomorphic character states include multiple inscriptional ribs, restriction of autotomy planes, and finger-like diverticula of the lungs.

All &quot;Uroplatus&quot; species have highly cryptic colouration, which acts as camouflage, most being grayish-brown to black or greenish-brown with various markings resembling tree bark. There are two variations of this camouflage: leaf form, and bark form. The leaf form is present in a number of small-bodied species. All other forms blend in well with tree bark upon which they rest during the day. Some of these tree bark forms have developed a flap of skin, running the length of the body, known as a &quot;dermal flap&quot;, which they lay against the tree during the day, scattering shadows, and making their outline practically invisible. These geckos bear a resemblance to geckos of the genera &quot;Phyllurus&quot; and &quot;Saltuarius&quot; of Australia. This is an example of convergent evolution.

The skull of &quot;Uroplatus&quot; is strongly ossified, with an extremely high tooth count and incipient secondary palate.

==Ecology==
&quot;Uroplatus&quot; geckos are exclusively nocturnal. The larger species spend most of the daylight hours hanging vertically on tree trunks, head down, resting, while the smaller leaf tailed geckos (&quot;U. phantasticus&quot;, &quot;U. ebenaui&quot;, &quot;U. finiavana&quot;, &quot;U. malama&quot;, &quot;U. fiera&quot;, &quot;U. fotsivava&quot;, and &quot;U. kelirambo&quot;) spend more time in bushes and small trees imitating twigs and leaves. They are all insectivores.

During their breeding season, female &quot;Uroplatus&quot; lay from 2–4 eggs depending on species and conditions.

==Captivity==
&quot;Uroplatus&quot; are found in the herpetology and pet trade, but rarely. Most are threatened by deforestation and habitat loss. The difficulty in diagnosing between species has led to accidental exportation of both threatened and undescribed species.

==Threats==
Habitat destruction and deforestation in Madagascar is the primary threat to the future of &quot;Uroplatus&quot; geckos as well as collection for the pet trade. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) lists all of the &quot;Uroplatus&quot; species on their &quot;Top ten most wanted species list&quot; of animals threatened by illegal wildlife trade, because of it &quot;being captured and sold at alarming rates for the international pet trade&quot;. It is a CITES Appendix 2 protected animal.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Uroplatus&quot; has had a complex taxonomic history. A detailed study from 2013 suggested there were at least 11 undescribed cryptic species in the genus, several of which have been described since its publication. In an attempt to better delineate the species boundaries of this genus, researchers have proposed karyotype analysis. These studies have yielded interesting results suggesting that &quot;Uroplatus&quot; is in a transitory evolutionary phase between two different chromosome shapes, arocentric and asymmetrical.

==Species==
The following 22 species are recognised.

*&quot;Uroplatus alluaudi&quot; – northern leaf-tail gecko
*&quot;Uroplatus ebenaui&quot; – spearpoint leaf-tail gecko
*&quot;Uroplatus fangorn&quot; 
*&quot;Uroplatus fetsy&quot; 
*&quot;Uroplatus fiera&quot; 
*&quot;Uroplatus fimbriatus&quot; – common leaf-tail gecko
*&quot;Uroplatus finaritra&quot; 
*&quot;Uroplatus finiavana&quot; 
*&quot;Uroplatus fivehy&quot; 
*&quot;Uroplatus fotsivava&quot; 
*&quot;Uroplatus garamaso&quot; 
*&quot;Uroplatus giganteus&quot; – giant leaf-tail gecko
*&quot;Uroplatus guentheri&quot; – Günther&#x27;s flat-tail gecko, Günther&#x27;s leaf-tail gecko
*&quot;Uroplatus henkeli&quot; – frilled leaf-tail gecko
*&quot;Uroplatus kelirambo&quot; 
*&quot;Uroplatus lineatus&quot; – lined leaf-tail gecko
*&quot;Uroplatus malahelo&quot; 
*&quot;Uroplatus malama&quot; 
*&quot;Uroplatus phantasticus&quot; – satanic leaf-tail gecko
*&quot;Uroplatus pietschmanni&quot; – cork-bark leaf-tail gecko
*&quot;Uroplatus sameiti&quot; 
*&quot;Uroplatus sikorae&quot; – mossy leaf-tail gecko

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Uroplatus&quot;.

<text>Jules Gabriel Janin (; 16 February 1804 – 19 June 1874) was a French writer and critic.

==Life and career==
Born in Saint-Étienne (Loire), Janin&#x27;s father was a lawyer, and he was educated first at St. Étienne, and then at the lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris. He involved himself in journalism from an early date, and worked on the &quot;Figaro&quot; and the &quot;Quotidienne&quot;, among others, until in 1830 he became dramatic critic of the &quot;Journal des Débats&quot;.

Long before, however, he had made a literary reputation for himself, publishing novels such as &quot;L&#x27;Âne mort et la Femme guillotinée&quot; (&quot;The Dead Donkey and the Guillotined Woman&quot;) (1829). &quot;La Confession&quot; (1830) followed, and then in &quot;Barnave&quot; (1831), he attacked the Orléans family. From the day when Janin became the theatrical critic of the &quot;Débats&quot;, though he continued to write books, he was most notable in France as a dramatic critic. Janin authored the text for the song &quot;Le Chant des chemins de fer&quot; by Hector Berlioz, a composer and fellow critic at the &quot;Débats&quot;.

After many years of &quot;feuilleton&quot; writing he collected some of his articles in the work called &quot;Histoire de la littérature dramatique en France (1853-1858).&quot; In 1865 he made his first attempt upon the Academy, but was not successful until five years later. Meanwhile, he had not been content with his feuilletons, written persistently about all manner of things. No one was more in request with the Paris publishers for prefaces, letterpress to illustrated books and suchlike. He was accused of taking bribes for favourable reviews, reputedly earning 6,000 to 8,000 francs from fearful playwrights on a premier.

Janin traveled (picking up in one of his journeys a country house at Lucca in a lottery), and wrote accounts of his travels. He wrote numerous tales and novels, and composed many other works, including &quot;Fin d&#x27;un monde et du neveu de Rameau&quot; (1861), in which, under the guise of a sequel to Diderot&#x27;s work, he showed his familiarity with the late 18th century. He married in 1841. In the early part of his career he had many quarrels, notably one with Felix Pyat (1810-1889), whom he prosecuted successfully for defamation of character.

For the most part his work was improvisation, noted for its light and vivid style. His &quot;Œuvres choisies&quot; (12 vols., 1875–1878) were edited by Albert Patin de La Fizelière. A study on Janin with a bibliography was published by Auguste Piédagnel in 1874. See also Sainte-Beuve, &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot;, ii. and v., and Gustave Planche, &quot;Portraits littéraires&quot;.

<text>Jean Baptiste Gustave Planche (16 February 1808 – 18 September 1857) was a French art and literary critic.

==Life and career==
Already in his time as a medical student, Planche frequented artistic circles. This did nothing to promote the success of his studies. Around 1830, Planche was introduced by the famous writer Alfred de Vigny to François Buloz, director of the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;, and contributed to this journal until 1840. In that year, his father, a rich apothecary, died, and over the few years, Planche dedicated himself to spending his 80,000 franc inheritance in Italy, his Salon reviews at the Revue des Deux Mondes taken over by Louis Peisse from 1841. He resumed his connection with the journal in 1846, a collaboration which was only terminated by his death in 1857, at the age of 49.

Planche was an honest critic and refused to accept a position from Napoleon III for fear of compromising his freedom. A fervent admirer of George Sand and Alfred de Vigny, he was contemptuous of Victor Hugo as a playwright. He characterized Hugo&#x27;s earlier dramas as odes (in allusion to Hugo&#x27;s book of poetry &#x27;Odes et Ballades&#x27;), those following the drama &quot;Le Roi s&#x27;amuse&quot; as antitheses (because their characters were torn apart by conflicting tendencies), and the later ones as nothing but . His critical papers were collected under the titles: &quot;Portraits littéraires&quot; (1836-1849); &quot;Nouveaux portraits littéraires&quot; (1854); and his art criticisms in &quot;Études sur l&#x27;école française&quot; (1855).

In his writings, Planche made an attempt to reconcile modern and classical art and literature by highlighting their common preoccupation in depicting human passions. Planche liked to formulate his opinions in a sharp and precise manner. His style is witty.

<text>The tiny scaled gecko (Lygodactylus bivittis) is a species of lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The species is endemic to Madagascar.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;L. bivittis&quot; was formerly placed in a monotypic genus &quot;Microscalabotes&quot;. However, molecular data suggested that &quot;Microscalabotes&quot; is nested within &quot;Lygodactylus&quot;, and the genus was synonymized.

==Habitat and behavior==
&quot;L. bivittis&quot; occurs in low and mid-elevation humid forests at elevations of above sea level. It is diurnal and lives in trees. It does not occur in heavily degraded areas and is threatened by the loss and degradation of humid forests in eastern Madagascar.

==Reproduction==
&quot;L. bivittis&quot; is oviparous.

<text>Geckolepis is a genus of geckos, commonly referred to as fish scale geckos, which are endemic to Madagascar and the Comoro Islands. They are nocturnal, arboreal, insectivorous lizards, found in primary and secondary forest, as well as degraded habitats. They are best known for their ability to lose their skin and scales when grasped by a predator.

== Skin and scales ==
The scales of &quot;Geckolepis&quot; are imbricated (overlapping) and ossified. Histological studies on the scales were performed as early as 1911 by Wilhelm Josef Schmidt. Schmidt noted the heterogeneity and imbrication of the scales, which makes meristics difficult on &quot;Geckolepis&quot;. Schmidt noted that the imbrication of the scales was a result of their folding, essentially being bilayered rather than monolayered. He showed also that the scale centres are ossified, formed from irregular crystals, which he illustrated in some detail. In their micro-CT scans, Scherz et al. found that the scales of &quot;G. megalepis&quot; and other species have the same degree of x-ray attenuation as bone, and concluded that this suggested the presence of osteoderm as well. They noted that, like in Schmidt&#x27;s illustrations, a zone toward the tip of the scales lacks ossifications as visible in micro-CT scans. Paluh et al. studied the osteoderm of &quot;Geckolepis&quot; cf. &quot;maculata&quot; using micro-CT and histology, and compared it to other geckos known to have osteoderm, namely &quot;Gekko gecko&quot; and &quot;Tarentola mauritanica&quot;. They found that the osteoderms differ strongly from those of the other gecko species that possess them, and represent a third independent convergent derivation of osteoderm in geckos. The osteoderm of &quot;Geckolepis&quot; somewhat resembles that of the Gerrhosauridae or &#x27;plated lizards&#x27;.

The scales of &quot;Geckolepis&quot; were known to come off already in the 19th century; Alfred Voeltzkow in 1983 described capturing specimens with bundles of cotton to avoid the scales coming off. Once lost, scales are regenerated, and eventually the regenerated scales are indistinguishable from original ones. The mechanism for this scale autotomy and the subsequent regeneration is not well understood, but was studied by C. Schubert and colleagues. These studies showed that it is not only the scales that are shed in the &#x27;dermolytic autotomy&#x27; of &quot;Geckolepis&quot;, but rather, there is a preformed splitting zone between the integument and the underlying connective tissue. They also showed that the dermolytic process is an active one, wherein a network of myofibroblasts in the splitting zone probably contract, followed by vasoconstriction to minimise blood loss. Their findings were questioned by Aaron M. Bauer and colleagues, but only based on comparative evidence from other geckos, which all have splitting zones within the integument, and not below it. Indeed, no subsequent studies have yet looked at this mechanism again, but there have been repeated calls for such investigation, especially as the regenerative properties may have relevance for human medicine.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Geckolepis&quot; has difficult taxonomy due to variable pholidosis. Recent taxonomic and genetic investigation have shown that several cryptic species are present in this genus. In 2016, Hawlitschek et al. resurrected &quot;G. humbloti&quot; from synonymy with &quot;G. maculata&quot;, as a species endemic to the Comoro Islands. In 2017, Scherz et al. (2017) described &quot;G. megalepis&quot; from the limestone pinnacle karst formations of Ankarana National Park—this species has larger scales than all other members of the genus, but it was also identified based on its osteology. The taxonomic identity of &quot;G. maculata&quot; remains uncertain.

== Species ==
The following five species are recognized:
*Peters&#x27;s spotted gecko or fish-scale gecko, &quot;Geckolepis maculata&quot; 
*Comoran fish scale gecko, &quot;Geckolepis humbloti&quot; 
*Many-scaled gecko, &quot;Geckolepis polylepis&quot; 
*Grandidier&#x27;s gecko, &quot;Geckolepis typica&quot; 
*&quot;Geckolepis megalepis&quot;

<doc id="323777" wikidata="Q58721" url="?curid=323777" title="Irreligion">
<text>Irreligion is the absence or rejection of religious beliefs or practices. It encompasses a wide range of viewpoints drawn from various philosophical and intellectual perspectives, including atheism, agnosticism, religious skepticism, rationalism, secularism, and non-religious spirituality. These perspectives can vary, with individuals who identify as irreligious holding diverse beliefs about religion and its role in their lives.

Relatively little scholarly research was published on non-belief until about 2010.

Over the past several decades, the number of secular persons has increased, with a rapid rise in the early 21st century, in many countries. In virtually every high-income country and many poor countries, religion has declined. Highly secular societies tend to be societally healthy and successful. Social scientists have predicted declines in religious beliefs and their replacement with more scientific/naturalistic outlooks (secularization hypothesis). According to Ronald Inglehart, this trend seems likely to continue and a reverse rarely lasts long because the trend is driven by technological innovation. However, other researchers disagree (contra-secularization hypothesis). By 2050, Pew Research Center (Pew) expects irreligious people to probably decline as a share of the world population (16.4% to 13.2%), at least for a time, because of faster population growth in highly religious countries and shrinking populations in at least some less religious countries. Many countries may also be gradually becoming more secular, generation by generation. Younger generations tend to be less religious than their elders. They might become more religious as they age, but still be less religious than previous generations if their countries become more affluent and stable. Nonetheless, secularization is compatible with religion since most versions of secularity do not lead to atheism or irreligion. Religious congruence, that is consistency between beliefs and behaviors, in individuals is rare. Religious incongruence is not the same thing as religious insincerity or hypocrisy. The widespread religious congruence fallacy occurs when interpretations or explanations unjustifiably presume religious congruence. This fallacy also infects &quot;new atheist&quot; critiques of religion.

Estimating the number of irreligious people in the world is difficult. Those who do not affiliate with a religion are diverse. In many countries censuses and demographic surveys do not separate atheists, agnostics and those responding &quot;nothing in particular&quot; as distinct populations, obscuring significant differences that may exist between them. People can feel reasonable anxieties about giving a politically ‘wrong’ answer – in either direction. Measurement of irreligiosity requires a high degree of cultural sensitivity, especially outside the West, where the concepts of &quot;religion&quot; or &quot;the secular&quot; are not always rooted in local culture and may not even be present. The sharp distinction, and often antagonism, between &quot;religious&quot; and &quot;secular&quot; is culturally and historically unique to the West since in most of human history and cultures, there was little differentiation between the natural and supernatural and concepts do not always transfer across cultures. Forms of secularity always reflect the societal, historical, cultural and religious contexts in which they emerge, and distinctions are sharp in religiously dominant contexts. Also, there&#x27;s considerable prevalence of atheism and agnosticism in ancient Asian texts. Atheistic traditions have played a significant part in those cultures for millennia. &quot;Cultural religion&quot; must be taken into account: non-religious people can be found in religious categories, especially where religion has very deep-seated religious roots in a culture. Many of the religiously unaffiliated have some religious beliefs. Also, some of them engage in certain kinds of religious practices. In 2016, Zuckerman, Galen and Pasquale estimated there were 400 million nonreligious or nontheistic people.
A 2022 Gallup International Association (GIA) survey, done in 61 countries, reported that 62% of respondents said they are religious, one in four that they aren&#x27;t, 10% that they&#x27;re atheists and the rest are not sure. In 2016, it found similar results (62%, 25%, 9% and 5%), also in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIN/GallupInternational2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; People in the European Union, East Asia and Oceania were the least religious.
In 2010, according to Pew, the religiously unaffiliated numbered more than 1.1 billion, about one-in-six people (16.3% of an estimated 6.9 billion). 76% of them resided in the 60 countries of Asia-Pacific. China, an atheist state and a Leninist religious state and the world&#x27;s most populous country, alone held the majority (62.2% or about 700 million). Several smaller countries eclipse China&#x27;s percent of residents who are irreligious. Shares were relatively similar in three of the six regions: Asia-Pacific (21.2% of more than 4 billion), Europe (18.2% of more than 742 thousands) and North America (17.1% of more than 344 thousands). Men, younger people, and whites, Asians, and people of Jewish heritage are more likely to be secular.

== Etymology==
Irreligion is either a borrowing from French or from Latin. The term &quot;irreligion&quot; is a combination of the noun &quot;religion&quot; and the &quot;ir-&quot; form of the prefix &quot;in-&quot;, signifying &quot;not&quot; (similar to &quot;irrelevant&quot;). It was first attested in French as in 1527, then in English as &quot;irreligion&quot; in 1598. It was borrowed into Dutch as in the 17th century, though it is not certain from which language.

==Definition==
According to the encyclopedia &quot;Britannica&quot;, the term irreligion is frequently characterized differently depending on context. Sometimes, surveys of religious belief use lack of identification with a religion as a marker of irreligion. This can be misleading: in some cases a person may identify with a religious cultural institution but not hold the doctrines of that institution or take part in its religious practice.

Some scholars define irreligion as the active rejection of religion, as opposed to the mere absence of religion. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Religion and Society&quot; defines it as: &quot;Active rejection of religion in general or any of its more specific organized forms. It is thus distinct from the secular, which simply refers to the absence of religion. [...] In contemporary usage, it is increasingly employed as a synonym for unbelief [...]&quot; Sociologist Colin Campbell also describes it as &quot;deliberate indifference towards religion&quot;, in his 1971 &quot;Towards a Sociology of Irreligion&quot;.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; has two definitions, one of which is labelled obsolete (first published in 1900). It is want of religion; hostility to or disregard of religious principles; irreligious conduct.

The &quot;Merriam Webster Dictionary&quot; defines it as &quot;the quality or state of being irreligious&quot; and &quot;irreligious&quot; as &quot;neglectful of religion: lacking religious emotions, doctrines, or practices&quot;, also &quot;indicating lack of religion&quot;.

Also for &quot;religion&quot;, there is no universally agreed-upon definition, even within the social sciences.

==Types==

* Agnostic atheism is a philosophical position that encompasses both atheism and agnosticism. Agnostic atheists are &quot;atheistic&quot; because they do not believe in the existence of any deity and &quot;agnostic&quot; because they claim that the existence of a deity is either unknowable in principle or unknown in fact.
* Agnosticism is the view that the existence of God, the divine, and the supernatural are unknown or unknowable.
* Alatrism or alatry (Greek: from the privative &quot;ἀ&quot;- + &quot;λατρεία (latreia)&quot; = worship) is the recognition of the existence of one or more gods, but with a deliberate lack of worship of any deity. Typically, it includes the belief that religious rituals have no supernatural significance and that gods ignore all prayers and worship.
* Anti-clericalism is opposition to religious authority, typically in social or political matters.
* Antireligion is opposition to or rejection of religion of any kind.
* Apatheism is the attitude of apathy or indifference toward the existence or non-existence of any deity.
* Atheism is the lack of belief that any deities exist; in a narrower sense, positive atheism is specifically the position that there are factually no deities. There are ranges of negative and positive atheism.
* Antitheism is the explicit opposition to theism. The term has had a range of applications. It typically refers to direct opposition to belief in any deity. 
* &quot;Cultural religion&quot;
* Deism is a philosophical position and rationalistic theology that rejects revelation as a source of knowledge and asserts that empirical reason and observation of the natural world are exclusively logical, reliable, and sufficient to determine the existence of a Supreme Being as the creator of the universe.
* Freethought. It holds that positions regarding truth should be formed on the basis of logic, reason, and empiricism rather than authority, tradition, revelation, or dogma.
* Ignosticism, also known as &quot;igtheism&quot;, is the idea that the question of the existence of God is meaningless because the word &quot;God&quot; has no coherent, unambiguous definition.
* Ietsism is an unspecified belief in an undetermined transcendent reality.
* Naturalism is the idea or belief that only natural (as opposed to supernatural or spiritual) laws and forces operate in the universe. 
* New Atheism is the position of some atheist academics, writers, scientists, and philosophers of the 20th and 21st centuries, such as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett.
* Nontheism
* Nones can be used to refer to those who are unaffiliated with any organized religion. This use derives from surveys of religious affiliation, in which &quot;None&quot; (or &quot;None of the above&quot;) is typically the last choice. Since this status can be chosen because of lack of organizational affiliation or lack of personal belief, it is a more specific concept than irreligion. A 2015 Gallup, Inc. poll concluded that in the United States &quot;nones&quot; were growing as a percentage of the population, while Christians were declining and non-Christians also increasing but to a much lesser degree, since the 1950s.
* Secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy in which ethics is based solely on human faculties, such as logic, empathy, reason, and ethical intuition, and not derived from belief in supernatural revelation or guidance—a source of ethics in many religions.
* Secular humanism is a system of thought that prioritizes human rather than divine matters.
* Secular liberalism is a form of liberalism in which secularist principles and values, and sometimes non-religious ethics, are especially emphasised.
* Secular paganism is an outlook that upholds the virtues and principles associated with paganism while maintaining a secular worldview.
* Post-theism is a variant of nontheism that proposes that the division of theism and atheism is obsolete and that the God-idea belongs to a stage of human development now past. Within nontheism, post-theism can be contrasted with antitheism.
* Religious skepticism is a type of skepticism about religion.
* Secularism. It is also used to describe a political conviction in favor of minimizing religion in the public sphere that may be advocated for regardless of personal religiosity. Sometimes, especially in the United States, it is also a synonym for naturalism or atheism.
* &quot;Spiritual but not religious&quot; (SBNR) is a designation coined by Robert C. Fuller for people who reject traditional or organized religion but have strong metaphysical beliefs. The SBNR may be included under the definition of nonreligion, but are sometimes classified as a wholly distinct group.
* Theological noncognitivism is the argument that religious language—specifically, words such as &quot;God&quot;—are not cognitively meaningful. It is sometimes considered synonymous with ignosticism.
* Transtheism refers to a system of thought or religious philosophy that is neither theistic nor atheistic but beyond them.

==History==

In the early 1970s, Colin Campbell began a sociological study of irreligion.

==Human rights==

In 1993, the United Nations Human Rights Committee declared that article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights &quot;protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief.&quot; The committee further stated that &quot;the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one&#x27;s current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views.&quot; Signatories to the convention are barred from &quot;the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers&quot; to recant their beliefs or convert.

Most democracies protect the freedom of religion or belief, and it is largely implied in respective legal systems that those who do not believe or observe any religion are allowed freedom of thought.

A noted exception to ambiguity, explicitly allowing non-religion, is Article 36 of the Constitution of China (as adopted in 1982), which states that &quot;No state organ, public organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion.&quot; Article 46 of China&#x27;s 1978 Constitution was even more explicit, stating that &quot;Citizens enjoy freedom to believe in religion and freedom not to believe in religion and to propagate atheism.&quot;

==Demographics==

Women in the labor force are more like men in religiosity. When they are out of it, they tend to be more religious.

In many countries censuses and demographic surveys do not separate atheists, agnostics and those responding &quot;nothing in particular&quot; as distinct populations.

Eleven countries have nonreligious majorities. In 2020, the countries with the highest percentage of &quot;Non-Religious&quot; (&quot;Term encompassing both (a) agnostics; and (b) atheists&quot;) were North Korea, the Czech Republic and Estonia. According to the 2018 Chinese General Social Survey, the country had the largest count of unaffiliated people: about one billion adults. Some boadly religious practices continue to play a significant role in the lives of a substantial shares of the Chinese population.

Determining objective irreligion, as part of societal or individual levels of secularity and religiosity, requires a high degree of cultural sensitivity from researchers. This is especially so outside the Western world, where the concepts of &quot;religious&quot; and &quot;secular&quot; are not necessarily rooted in local culture or even exist. &quot;Cultural religion&quot; is a vivid reality. It must be taken into account when trying to ascertain the numeric strength of atheism and agnosticism in a country. It is generally not considered more important than self-identification measures. Non-religious people can be found in religious categories. This is especially the case where religion has very deep-seated religious roots in a culture, such as with Christianity in Europe, Islam in the Middle East, Hinduism in India, and Buddhism in South-east Asia. For instance, Scandinavian countries have among the highest measures of nonreligiosity and even atheism in Europe. For example, 58% of the Swedish population identify with the Church of Sweden. Yet, 47% of atheists who live in those countries are still formally members of the national churches. In much of East Asia, ritual behavior holds greater salience than belief. China has state atheism and is a Leninist religious state, which maintains dominance over all other religions. About 85% of its population practice various kinds of religious behaviors with some regularity. Many East Asians identify as &quot;without religion&quot; ( in Chinese, in Japanese, in Korean), but &quot;religion&quot; in that context refers only to Buddhism or Christianity. Most of the people &quot;without religion&quot; practice Shinto and other folk religions. In the Muslim world, those who claim to be &quot;not religious&quot; mostly imply not strictly observing Islam, and in Israel, being &quot;secular&quot; means not strictly observing Orthodox Judaism. Vice versa, many American Jews share the worldviews of nonreligious people though affiliated with a Jewish denomination, and in Russia, growing identification with Eastern Orthodoxy is mainly motivated by cultural and nationalist considerations, without much concrete belief. In the United States, the majority of the &quot;Nones&quot;, those without a religious affiliation, have belief in a god or higher power, spiritual forces beyond the natural world, and souls.

In 2016, Zuckerman, Galen and Pasquale estimated there were 400 million nonreligious or nontheistic people. In their 2013 essay, Ariela Keysar and Juhem Navarro-Rivera estimated there were about 450 to 500 million nonbelievers, including both &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; atheists, or approximately 7% of the world population. These estimates come from the International Social Survey Programme 2008 survey in which 40 countries took part. In 2010, the religiously unaffiliated numbered more than 1.1 billion (around 1,126,500,000 persons), about one-in-six people (16.3% of an estimated 6,9 billion world population), according to Pew Research Center. In Pew reports, &quot;unaffiliated&quot; are atheists, agnostics, and people who checked &quot;nothing in particular&quot;. 76% of them resided in one of the six regions: Asia-Pacific. A 2012 WIN/Gallup International report on a poll from 57 countries reported that 59% of the world&#x27;s population identified as a religious person, 23% as not a religious person, 13% as &quot;convinced atheists&quot;, and also a 9% decrease in identification as &quot;religious&quot; when compared to the 2005 average from 39 countries. A 2015 WIN/Gallup International poll found that 63% of the globe identified as a religious person, 22% as not a religious person, and 11% as &quot;convinced atheists&quot;. Their 2016 survey found that 62% of the globe identified as a religious person, less than 25% as not a religious person, 9% others as &quot;convinced atheists&quot; and 5% others &quot;Do not know/no response&quot;. Keysar and Navarro-Rivera advised caution with these figures since other surveys have consistently reached lower figures for the number of atheists worldwide.

Inverse association between intelligence and religiosity, and the inverse correlation between intelligence and fertility might lead to a decline in non-religious identity (contra-secularization hypothesis) in the foreseeable future. In 2007, sociologist Phil Zuckerman&#x27;s global studies on atheism have indicated that global atheism may be in decline due to irreligious countries having the lowest birth rates in the world and religious countries having higher birth rates in general. A Pew 2015 global projection study for religion and nonreligion, projected that between 2010 and 2050, there will be some initial increases of the unaffiliated followed by a decline by 2050. Some theorists think religion will fade away but Pew reveals a more complicated picture. Pew predicts the unaffiliated share of the world population will decrease, at least for a while, from 16.4% to 13.2% by 2050. Pew states that religious areas are experiencing the fastest growth because of higher fertility and younger populations. By 2060, Pew says the number of unaffiliated will increase by over 35 million, but the overall population-percentage will decrease to 13% because the total population will grow faster. This would be mostly because of relatively old age and low fertility rates in less religious societies such as East Asia, particularly China and Japan, but also Western Europe. By 2019, 43 out of 49 countries studied continued to become less religious.

Relatively few unbelievers select ‘Atheist’ or ‘Agnostic’ as their preferred (non)religious or secular identity. Being nonreligious is not necessarily equivalent to being an atheist or agnostic. Many of the nonreligious have some religious beliefs. Also, some of the unaffiliated engage in certain kinds of religious practices. For example, &quot;belief in God or a higher power is shared by 7% of Chinese unaffiliated adults, 30% of French unaffiliated adults and 68% of unaffiliated U.S. adults. Being unaffiliated with a religion on polls does not automatically mean objectively nonreligious since there are, for example, unaffiliated people who fall under religious measures, just as some unbelievers may still attend a church or other place of worship. Out of the global nonreligious population, 76.2% reside in Asia-Pacific, while the remainder reside in Europe (12%), North America (5.2%), Latin America and the Caribbean (4%), sub-Saharan Africa (2.4%) and the Middle East and North Africa (0.2%).

===By population===

The Pew Research Centre in the table below reflects &quot;religiously unaffiliated&quot; in 2010 which &quot;include atheists, agnostics, and people who do not identify with any particular religion in surveys&quot;.

The Zuckerman data on the table below only reflect the number of people who have an absence of belief in a deity only (atheists, agnostics). These do not include the broader number of people who do not identify with a particular religion, such as deists, pantheists, and spiritual but not religious people.

==Historical trends==
Since 2007, there has been a surprising remarkably sharp trend away from religion. From about 2007 to 2019, 43 out of 49 countries studied became less religious. 
Past influential thinkers from Karl Marx to Max Weber to Émile Durkheim thought that the spread of scientific knowledge would dispel religion throughout the world. Industrialization also didn&#x27;t cause religion to disappear. Political scientists Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris argue faith is &quot;more emotional than cognitive&quot;, and both advance an alternative thesis termed &quot;existential security.&quot; They postulate that rather than knowledge or ignorance of scientific learning, it is the weakness or vulnerability of a society that determines religiosity. They claim that increased poverty and chaos make religious values more important to a society, while wealth and security diminish its role. As need for religious support diminishes, there is less willingness to &quot;accept its constraints, including keeping women in the kitchen and gay people in the closet&quot;.

===Prior to the 1980s===
Rates of people identifying as non-religious began rising in most societies at least as early as the turn of the 20th century. In 1968, sociologist Glenn M. Vernon wrote that US census respondents who identified as &quot;no religion&quot; were insufficiently defined because they were defined in terms of a negative. He contrasted the label with the term &quot;independent&quot; for political affiliation, which still includes people who participate in civic activities. He suggested this difficulty in definition was partially due to the dilemma of defining religious activity beyond membership, attendance, or other identification with a formal religious group. During the 1970s, social scientists still tended to describe irreligion from a perspective that considered religion as normative for humans. Irreligion was described in terms of hostility, reactivity, or indifference toward religion, and or as developing from radical theologies.

===1981–2019===

In a study of religious trends in 49 countries (they contained 60 percent of the world’s population) from 1981 to 2007, Inglehart and Norris found an overall, but not universal, increase in religiosity. Respondents in 33 of 49 countries rated themselves higher on a scale from one to ten when asked how important God was in their lives. This increase occurred in most former communist and developing countries. Most high-income countries became less religious. A sharp reversal of the global trend occurred from 2007 to 2019, when 43 out of 49 countries studied became less religious. This reversal appeared across most of the world. The decline in belief was not confined to high-income countries and appeared across most of the world. In virtually every high-income country, religion has continued to decline. At the same time, many poor countries, together with most of the former communist states, have also become less religious. From 2007 to 2019, only five countries became more religious, whereas the vast majority of the countries studied moved in the opposite direction. India is the most important exception to the general pattern of declining religiosity. The United States was a dramatic example of declining religiositywith the mean rating of importance of religion dropping from 8.2 to 4.6while India was a major exception. Research in 1989 recorded disparities in religious adherence for different faith groups, with people from Christian and tribal traditions leaving religion at a greater rate than those from Muslim, Hindu, or Buddhist faiths.

Inglehart and Norris speculate that the decline in religiosity comes from a decline in the social need for traditional gender and sexual norms, (&quot;virtually all world religions instilled&quot; pro-fertility norms such as &quot;producing as many children as possible and discouraged divorce, abortion, homosexuality, contraception, and any sexual behavior not linked to reproduction&quot; in their adherents for centuries) as life expectancy rose and infant mortality dropped. They also argue that the idea that religion was necessary to prevent a collapse of social cohesion and public morality was belied by lower levels of corruption and murder in less religious countries. They argue that both of these trends are based on the theory that as societies develop, survival becomes more secure: starvation, once pervasive, becomes uncommon; life expectancy increases; murder and other forms of violence diminish. As this level of security rises, there is less social/economic need for the high birthrates that religion encourages and less emotional need for the comfort of religious belief Change in acceptance of &quot;divorce, abortion, and homosexuality&quot; has been measured by the World Values Survey and shown to have grown throughout the world outside of Muslim-majority countries. Several very comprehensive surveys in the Middle East and Iran have come to similar conclusions: there is an increase in secularization and growing calls for reforms in religious political institutions.

<text>Homopholis is a genus of geckos found in Sub-Saharan Africa. Their diet consists of small insects, and they are oviparous.

==Species==
There are four species:
* &quot;Homopholis arnoldi&quot; 
* &quot;Homopholis fasciata&quot; — banded velvet gecko, striped velvet gecko
* &quot;Homopholis mulleri&quot; — Muller&#x27;s velvet gecko
* &quot;Homopholis wahlbergii&quot; — Wahlberg&#x27;s velvet gecko

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Homopholis&quot;.

Nomenclatural note: The spelling walbergii was corrected to wahlbergii by Smith (1849) in an errata within an addenda slip (unpaginated).

<text>Structural functionalism, or simply functionalism, is &quot;a framework for building theory that sees society as a complex system whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability&quot;.

This approach looks at society through a macro-level orientation, which is a broad focus on the social structures that shape society as a whole, and believes that society has evolved like organisms. This approach looks at both social structure and social functions. Functionalism addresses society as a whole in terms of the function of its constituent elements; namely norms, customs, traditions, and institutions.

A common analogy called the organic or biological analogy, popularized by Herbert Spencer, presents these parts of society as human body &quot;organs&quot; that work toward the proper functioning of the &quot;body&quot; as a whole. In the most basic terms, it simply emphasizes &quot;the effort to impute, as rigorously as possible, to each feature, custom, or practice, its effect on the functioning of a supposedly stable, cohesive system&quot;. For Talcott Parsons, &quot;structural-functionalism&quot; came to describe a particular stage in the methodological development of social science, rather than a specific school of thought.

==Theory==

In sociology, classical theories are defined by a tendency towards biological analogy and notions of social evolutionism:
While one may regard functionalism as a logical extension of the organic analogies for societies presented by political philosophers such as Rousseau, sociology draws firmer attention to those institutions unique to industrialized capitalist society (or &quot;modernity&quot;).

Auguste Comte believed that society constitutes a separate &quot;level&quot; of reality, distinct from both biological and inorganic matter. Explanations of social phenomena had therefore to be constructed within this level, individuals being merely transient occupants of comparatively stable social roles. In this view, Comte was followed by Émile Durkheim.
A central concern for Durkheim was the question of how certain societies maintain internal stability and survive over time. He proposed that such societies tend to be segmented, with equivalent parts held together by shared values, common symbols or (as his nephew Marcel Mauss held), systems of exchanges. Durkheim used the term &quot;mechanical solidarity&quot; to refer to these types of &quot;social bonds, based on common sentiments and shared moral values, that are strong among members of pre-industrial societies&quot;. In modern, complex societies, members perform very different tasks, resulting in a strong interdependence. Based on the metaphor above of an organism in which many parts function together to sustain the whole, Durkheim argued that complex societies are held together by &quot;organic solidarity&quot;, i.e. &quot;social bonds, based on specialization and interdependence, that are strong among members of industrial societies&quot;.

The central concern of structural functionalism may be regarded as a continuation of the Durkheimian task of explaining the apparent stability and internal cohesion needed by societies to endure over time. Societies are seen as coherent, bounded and fundamentally relational constructs that function like organisms, with their various (or social institutions) working together in an unconscious, quasi-automatic fashion toward achieving an overall social equilibrium. All social and cultural phenomena are therefore seen as functional in the sense of working together, and are effectively deemed to have &quot;lives&quot; of their own. They are primarily analyzed in terms of this function. The individual is significant not in and of themselves, but rather in terms of their status, their position in patterns of social relations, and the behaviours associated with their status. Therefore, the social structure is the network of statuses connected by associated roles.

Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as Marcel Mauss, Bronisław Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown. The prefix &#x27;structural&#x27; emerged in Radcliffe-Brown&#x27;s specific usage. Radcliffe-Brown proposed that most stateless, &quot;primitive&quot; societies, lacking strong centralized institutions, are based on an association of corporate-descent groups, i.e. the respective society&#x27;s recognised kinship groups. Structural functionalism also took on Malinowski&#x27;s argument that the basic building block of society is the nuclear family, and that the clan is an outgrowth, not &quot;vice versa&quot;.
It is simplistic to equate the perspective directly with political conservatism. The tendency to emphasize &quot;cohesive systems&quot;, however, leads functionalist theories to be contrasted with &quot;conflict theories&quot; which instead emphasize social problems and inequalities.

==Prominent theorists==

===Auguste Comte===

Auguste Comte, the &quot;Father of Positivism&quot;, pointed out the need to keep society unified as many traditions were diminishing. He was the first person to coin the term &quot;sociology&quot;. Comte suggests that sociology is the product of a three-stage development:
# Theological stage: From the beginning of human history until the end of the European Middle Ages, people took a religious view that society expressed God&#x27;s will. In the theological state, the human mind, seeking the essential nature of beings, the first and final causes (the origin and purpose) of all effects—in short, absolute knowledge—supposes all phenomena to be produced by the immediate action of supernatural beings.
# Metaphysical stage: People began seeing society as a natural system as opposed to the supernatural. This began with enlightenment and the ideas of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. Perceptions of society reflected the failings of a selfish human nature rather than the perfection of God.
# Positive or scientific stage: Describing society through the application of the scientific approach, which draws on the work of scientists.

===Herbert Spencer===

Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) was a British philosopher famous for applying the theory of natural selection to society. He was in many ways the first true sociological functionalist. In fact, while Durkheim is widely considered the most important functionalist among positivist theorists, it is known that much of his analysis was culled from reading Spencer&#x27;s work, especially his &quot;Principles of Sociology&quot; (1874–96). In describing society, Spencer alludes to the analogy of a human body. Just as the structural parts of the human body—the skeleton, muscles, and various internal organs—function independently to help the entire organism survive, social structures work together to preserve society.

While reading Spencer&#x27;s massive volumes can be tedious (long passages explicating the organic analogy, with reference to cells, simple organisms, animals, humans and society), there are some important insights that have quietly influenced many contemporary theorists, including Talcott Parsons, in his early work &quot;The Structure of Social Action&quot; (1937). Cultural anthropology also consistently uses functionalism.

This evolutionary model, unlike most 19th century evolutionary theories, is cyclical, beginning with the differentiation and increasing complication of an organic or &quot;super-organic&quot; (Spencer&#x27;s term for a social system) body, followed by a fluctuating state of equilibrium and disequilibrium (or a state of adjustment and adaptation), and, finally, the stage of disintegration or dissolution. Following Thomas Malthus&#x27; population principles, Spencer concluded that society is constantly facing selection pressures (internal and external) that force it to adapt its internal structure through differentiation.

Every solution, however, causes a new set of selection pressures that threaten society&#x27;s viability. Spencer was not a determinist in the sense that he never said that
# Selection pressures will be felt in time to change them;
# They will be felt and reacted to; or
# The solutions will always work.

In fact, he was in many ways a political sociologist, and recognized that the degree of centralized and consolidated authority in a given polity could make or break its ability to adapt. In other words, he saw a general trend towards the centralization of power as leading to stagnation and ultimately, pressures to decentralize.

More specifically, Spencer recognized three functional needs or prerequisites that produce selection pressures: they are regulatory, operative (production) and distributive. He argued that all societies need to solve problems of control and coordination, production of goods, services and ideas, and, finally, to find ways of distributing these resources.

Initially, in tribal societies, these three needs are inseparable, and the kinship system is the dominant structure that satisfies them. As many scholars have noted, all institutions are subsumed under kinship organization, but, with increasing population (both in terms of sheer numbers and density), problems emerge with regard to feeding individuals, creating new forms of organization—consider the emergent division of labour—coordinating and controlling various differentiated social units, and developing systems of resource distribution.

The solution, as Spencer sees it, is to differentiate structures to fulfill more specialized functions; thus, a chief or &quot;big man&quot; emerges, soon followed by a group of lieutenants, and later kings and administrators. The structural parts of society (e.g. families, work) function interdependently to help society function. Therefore, social structures work together to preserve society.

===Talcott Parsons===
Talcott Parsons began writing in the 1930s and contributed to sociology, political science, anthropology, and psychology. Structural functionalism and Parsons have received much criticism. Numerous critics have pointed out Parsons&#x27; underemphasis of political and monetary struggle, the basics of social change, and the by and large &quot;manipulative&quot; conduct unregulated by qualities and standards. Structural functionalism, and a large portion of Parsons&#x27; works, appear to be insufficient in their definitions concerning the connections amongst institutionalized and non-institutionalized conduct, and the procedures by which institutionalization happens.

Parsons was heavily influenced by Durkheim and Max Weber, synthesizing much of their work into his action theory, which he based on the system-theoretical concept and the methodological principle of voluntary action. He held that &quot;the social system is made up of the actions of individuals&quot;. His starting point, accordingly, is the interaction between two individuals faced with a variety of choices about how they might act, choices that are influenced and constrained by a number of physical and social factors.

Parsons determined that each individual has expectations of the other&#x27;s action and reaction to their own behavior, and that these expectations would (if successful) be &quot;derived&quot; from the accepted norms and values of the society they inhabit. As Parsons himself emphasized, in a general context there would never exist any perfect &quot;fit&quot; between behaviors and norms, so such a relation is never complete or &quot;perfect&quot;.

Social norms were always problematic for Parsons, who never claimed (as has often been alleged) that social norms were generally accepted and agreed upon, should this prevent some kind of universal law. Whether social norms were accepted or not was for Parsons simply a historical question.

As behaviors are repeated in more interactions, and these expectations are entrenched or institutionalized, a role is created. Parsons defines a &quot;role&quot; as the normatively-regulated participation &quot;of a person in a concrete process of social interaction with specific, concrete role-partners&quot;. Although any individual, theoretically, can fulfill any role, the individual is expected to conform to the norms governing the nature of the role they fulfill.

Furthermore, one person can and does fulfill many different roles at the same time. In one sense, an individual can be seen to be a &quot;composition&quot; of the roles he inhabits. Certainly, today, when asked to describe themselves, most people would answer with reference to their societal roles.

Parsons later developed the idea of roles into collectivities of roles that complement each other in fulfilling functions for society. Some roles are bound up in institutions and social structures (economic, educational, legal and even gender-based). These are functional in the sense that they assist society in operating and fulfilling its functional needs so that society runs smoothly.

Contrary to prevailing myth, Parsons never spoke about a society where there was no conflict or some kind of &quot;perfect&quot; equilibrium. A society&#x27;s cultural value-system was in the typical case never completely integrated, never static and most of the time, like in the case of the American society, in a complex state of transformation relative to its historical point of departure. To reach a &quot;perfect&quot; equilibrium was not any serious theoretical question in Parsons analysis of social systems, indeed, the most dynamic societies had generally cultural systems with important inner tensions like the US and India. These tensions were a source of their strength according to Parsons rather than the opposite. Parsons never thought about system-institutionalization and the level of strains (tensions, conflict) in the system as opposite forces per se.

The key processes for Parsons for system reproduction are socialization and social control. Socialization is important because it is the mechanism for transferring the accepted norms and values of society to the individuals within the system. Parsons never spoke about &quot;perfect socialization&quot;in any society socialization was only partial and &quot;incomplete&quot; from an integral point of view.

Parsons states that &quot;this point ... is independent of the sense in which [the] individual is concretely autonomous or creative rather than &#x27;passive&#x27; or &#x27;conforming&#x27;, for individuality and creativity, are to a considerable extent, phenomena of the institutionalization of expectations&quot;; they are culturally constructed.

Socialization is supported by the positive and negative sanctioning of role behaviours that do or do not meet these expectations. A punishment could be informal, like a snigger or gossip, or more formalized, through institutions such as prisons and mental homes. If these two processes were perfect, society would become static and unchanging, but in reality, this is unlikely to occur for long.

Parsons recognizes this, stating that he treats &quot;the structure of the system as problematic and subject to change&quot;, and that his concept of the tendency towards equilibrium &quot;does not imply the empirical dominance of stability over change&quot;. He does, however, believe that these changes occur in a relatively smooth way.

Individuals in interaction with changing situations adapt through a process of &quot;role bargaining&quot;. Once the roles are established, they create norms that guide further action and are thus institutionalized, creating stability across social interactions. Where the adaptation process cannot adjust, due to sharp shocks or immediate radical change, structural dissolution occurs and either new structures (or therefore a new system) are formed, or society dies. This model of social change has been described as a &quot;moving equilibrium&quot;, and emphasizes a desire for social order.

===Davis and Moore===
Kingsley Davis and Wilbert E. Moore (1945) gave an argument for social stratification based on the idea of &quot;functional necessity&quot; (also known as the Davis-Moore hypothesis). They argue that the most difficult jobs in any society have the highest incomes in order to motivate individuals to fill the roles needed by the division of labour. Thus, inequality serves social stability.

This argument has been criticized as fallacious from a number of different angles: the argument is both that the individuals who are the most deserving are the highest rewarded, and that &quot;a system of unequal rewards&quot; is necessary, otherwise no individuals would perform as needed for the society to function. The problem is that these rewards are supposed to be based upon objective merit, rather than subjective &quot;motivations.&quot; The argument also does not clearly establish why some positions are worth more than others, even when they benefit more people in society, e.g., teachers compared to athletes and movie stars. Critics have suggested that structural inequality (inherited wealth, family power, etc.) is itself a cause of individual success or failure, not a consequence of it.

===Robert Merton===
Robert K. Merton made important refinements to functionalist thought. He fundamentally agreed with Parsons&#x27; theory but acknowledged that Parsons&#x27; theory could be questioned, believing that it was over generalized. Merton tended to emphasize middle range theory rather than a grand theory, meaning that he was able to deal specifically with some of the limitations in Parsons&#x27; thinking. Merton believed that any social structure probably has many functions, some more obvious than others. He identified three main limitations: functional unity, universal functionalism and indispensability. He also developed the concept of deviance and made the distinction between manifest and latent functions. Manifest functions referred to the recognized and intended consequences of any social pattern. Latent functions referred to unrecognized and unintended consequences of any social pattern.

Merton criticized functional unity, saying that not all parts of a modern complex society work for the functional unity of society. Consequently, there is a social dysfunction referred to as any social pattern that may disrupt the operation of society. Some institutions and structures may have other functions, and some may even be generally dysfunctional, or be functional for some while being dysfunctional for others. This is because not all structures are functional for society as a whole. Some practices are only functional for a dominant individual or a group. 

There are two types of functions that Merton discusses the &quot;manifest functions&quot; in that a social pattern can trigger a recognized and intended consequence. The manifest function of education includes preparing for a career by getting good grades, graduation and finding good job. The second type of function is &quot;latent functions&quot;, where a social pattern results in an unrecognized or unintended consequence. The latent functions of education include meeting new people, extra-curricular activities, school trips. 

Another type of social function is &quot;social dysfunction&quot; which is any undesirable consequences that disrupts the operation of society. The social dysfunction of education includes not getting good grades, a job. Merton states that by recognizing and examining the dysfunctional aspects of society we can explain the development and persistence of alternatives. Thus, as Holmwood states, &quot;Merton explicitly made power and conflict central issues for research within a functionalist paradigm.&quot;

Merton also noted that there may be functional alternatives to the institutions and structures currently fulfilling the functions of society. This means that the institutions that currently exist are not indispensable to society. Merton states &quot;just as the same item may have multiple functions, so may the same function be diversely fulfilled by alternative items.&quot; This notion of functional alternatives is important because it reduces the tendency of functionalism to imply approval of the status quo.

Merton&#x27;s theory of deviance is derived from Durkheim&#x27;s idea of anomie. It is central in explaining how internal changes can occur in a system. For Merton, anomie means a discontinuity between cultural goals and the accepted methods available for reaching them.

Merton believes that there are 5 situations facing an actor.
* Conformity occurs when an individual has the means and desire to achieve the cultural goals socialized into them.
* Innovation occurs when an individual strives to attain the accepted cultural goals but chooses to do so in novel or unaccepted method.
* Ritualism occurs when an individual continues to do things as prescribed by society but forfeits the achievement of the goals.
* Retreatism is the rejection of both the means and the goals of society.
* Rebellion is a combination of the rejection of societal goals and means and a substitution of other goals and means.
Thus it can be seen that change can occur internally in society through either innovation or rebellion. It is true that society will attempt to control these individuals and negate the changes, but as the innovation or rebellion builds momentum, society will eventually adapt or face dissolution.

===Almond and Powell===
In the 1970s, political scientists Gabriel Almond and Bingham Powell introduced a structural-functionalist approach to comparing political systems. They argued that, in order to understand a political system, it is necessary to understand not only its institutions (or structures) but also their respective functions. They also insisted that these institutions, to be properly understood, must be placed in a meaningful and dynamic historical context.

This idea stood in marked contrast to prevalent approaches in the field of comparative politics—the state-society theory and the dependency theory. These were the descendants of David Easton&#x27;s system theory in international relations, a mechanistic view that saw all political systems as essentially the same, subject to the same laws of &quot;stimulus and response&quot;—or inputs and outputs—while paying little attention to unique characteristics. The structural-functional approach is based on the view that a political system is made up of several key components, including interest groups, political parties and branches of government.

In addition to structures, Almond and Powell showed that a political system consists of various functions, chief among them political socialization, recruitment and communication: socialization refers to the way in which societies pass along their values and beliefs to succeeding generations, and in political terms describe the process by which a society inculcates civic virtues, or the habits of effective citizenship; recruitment denotes the process by which a political system generates interest, engagement and participation from citizens; and communication refers to the way that a system promulgates its values and information.

==Unilineal descent==
In their attempt to explain the social stability of African &quot;primitive&quot; stateless societies where they undertook their fieldwork, Evans-Pritchard (1940) and Meyer Fortes (1945) argued that the Tallensi and the Nuer were primarily organized around unilineal descent groups. Such groups are characterized by common purposes, such as administering property or defending against attacks; they form a permanent social structure that persists well beyond the lifespan of their members. In the case of the Tallensi and the Nuer, these corporate groups were based on kinship which in turn fitted into the larger structures of unilineal descent; consequently Evans-Pritchard&#x27;s and Fortes&#x27; model is called &quot;descent theory&quot;. Moreover, in this African context territorial divisions were aligned with lineages; descent theory therefore synthesized both blood and soil as the same. Affinal ties with the parent through whom descent is not reckoned, however, are considered to be merely complementary or secondary (Fortes created the concept of &quot;complementary filiation&quot;), with the reckoning of kinship through descent being considered the primary organizing force of social systems. Because of its strong emphasis on unilineal descent, this new kinship theory came to be called &quot;descent theory&quot;.

With no delay, descent theory had found its critics. Many African tribal societies seemed to fit this neat model rather well, although Africanists, such as Paul Richards, also argued that Fortes and Evans-Pritchard had deliberately downplayed internal contradictions and overemphasized the stability of the local lineage systems and their significance for the organization of society. However, in many Asian settings the problems were even more obvious. In Papua New Guinea, the local patrilineal descent groups were fragmented and contained large amounts of non-agnates. Status distinctions did not depend on descent, and genealogies were too short to account for social solidarity through identification with a common ancestor. In particular, the phenomenon of cognatic (or bilateral) kinship posed a serious problem to the proposition that descent groups are the primary element behind the social structures of &quot;primitive&quot; societies.

Leach&#x27;s (1966) critique came in the form of the classical Malinowskian argument, pointing out that &quot;in Evans-Pritchard&#x27;s studies of the Nuer and also in Fortes&#x27;s studies of the Tallensi unilineal descent turns out to be largely an ideal concept to which the empirical facts are only adapted by means of fictions&quot;. People&#x27;s self-interest, manoeuvring, manipulation and competition had been ignored. Moreover, descent theory neglected the significance of marriage and affinal ties, which were emphasized by Lévi-Strauss&#x27;s structural anthropology, at the expense of overemphasizing the role of descent. To quote Leach: &quot;The evident importance attached to matrilateral and affinal kinship connections is not so much explained as explained away.&quot;

==Biological==

Biological functionalism is an anthropological paradigm, asserting that all social institutions, beliefs, values and practices serve to address pragmatic concerns. In many ways, the theorem derives from the longer-established structural functionalism, yet the two theorems diverge from one another significantly. While both maintain the fundamental belief that a social structure is composed of many interdependent frames of reference, biological functionalists criticise the structural view that a social solidarity and collective conscience is required in a functioning system. By that fact, biological functionalism maintains that our individual survival and health is the driving provocation of actions, and that the importance of social rigidity is negligible.

===Everyday application===
Although the actions of humans without doubt do not always engender positive results for the individual, a biological functionalist would argue that the intention was still self-preservation, albeit unsuccessful. An example of this is the belief in luck as an entity; while a disproportionately strong belief in good luck may lead to undesirable results, such as a huge loss in money from gambling, biological functionalism maintains that the newly created ability of the gambler to condemn luck will allow them to be free of individual blame, thus serving a practical and individual purpose. In this sense, biological functionalism maintains that while bad results often occur in life, which do not serve any pragmatic concerns, an entrenched cognitive psychological motivation was attempting to create a positive result, in spite of its eventual failure.
==Decline==
Structural functionalism reached the peak of its influence in the 1940s and 1950s, and by the 1960s was in rapid decline. By the 1980s, its place was taken in Europe by more conflict-oriented approaches, and more recently by structuralism. While some of the critical approaches also gained popularity in the United States, the mainstream of the discipline has instead shifted to a myriad of empirically oriented middle-range theories with no overarching theoretical orientation. To most sociologists, functionalism is now &quot;as dead as a dodo&quot;.

As the influence of functionalism in the 1960s began to wane, the linguistic and cultural turns led to a myriad of new movements in the social sciences: &quot;According to Giddens, the orthodox consensus terminated in the late 1960s and 1970s as the middle ground shared by otherwise competing perspectives gave way and was replaced by a baffling variety of competing perspectives. This third generation of social theory includes phenomenologically inspired approaches, critical theory, ethnomethodology, symbolic interactionism, structuralism, post-structuralism, and theories written in the tradition of hermeneutics and ordinary language philosophy.&quot;

While absent from empirical sociology, functionalist themes remained detectable in sociological theory, most notably in the works of Luhmann and Giddens. There are, however, signs of an incipient revival, as functionalist claims have recently been bolstered by developments in multilevel selection theory and in empirical research on how groups solve social dilemmas. Recent developments in evolutionary theory—especially by biologist David Sloan Wilson and anthropologists Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson—have provided strong support for structural functionalism in the form of multilevel selection theory. In this theory, culture and social structure are seen as a Darwinian (biological or cultural) adaptation at the group level.

==Criticisms==

In the 1960s, functionalism was criticized for being unable to account for social change, or for structural contradictions and conflict (and thus was often called &quot;consensus theory&quot;). Also, it ignores inequalities including race, gender, class, which cause tension and conflict. The refutation of the second criticism of functionalism, that it is static and has no concept of change, has already been articulated above, concluding that while Parsons&#x27; theory allows for change, it is an orderly process of change [Parsons, 1961:38], a moving equilibrium. Therefore, referring to Parsons&#x27; theory of society as static is inaccurate. It is true that it does place emphasis on equilibrium and the maintenance or quick return to social order, but this is a product of the time in which Parsons was writing (post-World War II, and the start of the cold war). Society was in upheaval and fear abounded. At the time social order was crucial, and this is reflected in Parsons&#x27; tendency to promote equilibrium and social order rather than social change.

Furthermore, Durkheim favoured a radical form of guild socialism along with functionalist explanations. Also, Marxism, while acknowledging social contradictions, still uses functionalist explanations. Parsons&#x27; evolutionary theory describes the differentiation and reintegration systems and subsystems and thus at least temporary conflict before reintegration (&quot;ibid&quot;). &quot;The fact that functional analysis can be seen by some as inherently conservative and by others as inherently radical suggests that it may be &quot;inherently&quot; neither one nor the other.&quot;

Stronger criticisms include the epistemological argument that functionalism is tautologous, that is, it attempts to account for the development of social institutions solely through recourse to the effects that are attributed to them, and thereby explains the two circularly. However, Parsons drew directly on many of Durkheim&#x27;s concepts in creating his theory. Certainly Durkheim was one of the first theorists to explain a phenomenon with reference to the function it served for society. He said, &quot;the determination of function is…necessary for the complete explanation of the phenomena.&quot; However Durkheim made a clear distinction between historical and functional analysis, saying, &quot;When ... the explanation of a social phenomenon is undertaken, we must seek separately the efficient cause which produces it and the function it fulfills.&quot; If Durkheim made this distinction, then it is unlikely that Parsons did not. 

However Merton does explicitly state that functional analysis does not seek to explain why the action happened in the first instance, but why it continues or is reproduced. By this particular logic, it can be argued that functionalists do not necessarily explain the original cause of a phenomenon with reference to its effect. Yet the logic stated in reverse, that social phenomena are (re)produced because they serve ends, is unoriginal to functionalist thought. Thus functionalism is either undefinable or it can be defined by the teleological arguments which functionalist theorists normatively produced before Merton.

Another criticism describes the ontological argument that society cannot have &quot;needs&quot; as a human being does, and even if society does have needs they need not be met. Anthony Giddens argues that functionalist explanations may all be rewritten as historical accounts of individual human actions and consequences (see Structuration).

A further criticism directed at functionalism is that it contains no sense of agency, that individuals are seen as puppets, acting as their role requires. Yet Holmwood states that the most sophisticated forms of functionalism are based on &quot;a highly developed concept of action,&quot; and as was explained above, Parsons took as his starting point the individual and their actions. His theory did not however articulate how these actors exercise their agency in opposition to the socialization and inculcation of accepted norms. As has been shown above, Merton addressed this limitation through his concept of deviance, and so it can be seen that functionalism allows for agency. It cannot, however, explain why individuals choose to accept or reject the accepted norms, why and in what circumstances they choose to exercise their agency, and this does remain a considerable limitation of the theory.

Further criticisms have been levelled at functionalism by proponents of other social theories, particularly conflict theorists, Marxists, feminists and postmodernists. Conflict theorists criticized functionalism&#x27;s concept of systems as giving far too much weight to integration and consensus, and neglecting independence and conflict. Lockwood, in line with conflict theory, suggested that Parsons&#x27; theory missed the concept of system contradiction. He did not account for those parts of the system that might have tendencies to mal-integration. According to Lockwood, it was these tendencies that come to the surface as opposition and conflict among actors. However Parsons thought that the issues of conflict and cooperation were very much intertwined and sought to account for both in his model. In this however he was limited by his analysis of an ‘ideal type&#x27; of society which was characterized by consensus. Merton, through his critique of functional unity, introduced into functionalism an explicit analysis of tension and conflict. Yet Merton&#x27;s functionalist explanations of social phenomena continued to rest on the idea that society is primarily co-operative rather than conflicted, which differentiates Merton from conflict theorists.

Marxism, which was revived soon after the emergence of conflict theory, criticized professional sociology (functionalism and conflict theory alike) for being partisan to advanced welfare capitalism. Gouldner thought that Parsons&#x27; theory specifically was an expression of the dominant interests of welfare capitalism, that it justified institutions with reference to the function they fulfill for society. It may be that Parsons&#x27; work implied or articulated that certain institutions were necessary to fulfill the functional prerequisites of society, but whether or not this is the case, Merton explicitly states that institutions are not indispensable and that there are functional alternatives. That he does not identify any alternatives to the current institutions does reflect a conservative bias, which as has been stated before is a product of the specific time that he was writing in.

As functionalism&#x27;s prominence was ending, feminism was on the rise, and it attempted a radical criticism of functionalism. It believed that functionalism neglected the suppression of women within the family structure. Holmwood shows, however, that Parsons did in fact describe the situations where tensions and conflict existed or were about to take place, even if he did not articulate those conflicts. Some feminists agree, suggesting that Parsons provided accurate descriptions of these situations. On the other hand, Parsons recognized that he had oversimplified his functional analysis of women in relation to work and the family, and focused on the positive functions of the family for society and not on its dysfunctions for women. Merton, too, although addressing situations where function and dysfunction occurred simultaneously, lacked a &quot;feminist sensibility&quot;.

Postmodernism, as a theory, is critical of claims of objectivity. Therefore, the idea of grand theory and grand narrative that can explain society in all its forms is treated with skepticism. This critique focuses on exposing the danger that grand theory can pose when not seen as a limited perspective, as one way of understanding society.

Jeffrey Alexander (1985) sees functionalism as a broad school rather than a specific method or system, such as Parsons, who is capable of taking equilibrium (stability) as a reference-point rather than assumption and treats structural differentiation as a major form of social change. The name &#x27;functionalism&#x27; implies a difference of method or interpretation that does not exist. This removes the determinism criticized above. Cohen argues that rather than needs a society has dispositional facts: features of the social environment that support the existence of particular social institutions but do not cause them.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Rousseau (6 April 1671 – 17 March 1741) was a French playwright and poet, particularly noted for his cynical epigrams.

==Biography==
Rousseau was born in Paris, the son of a shoemaker, and was well educated. As a young man, he gained favour with Boileau, who encouraged him to write. Rousseau began with the theatre, for which he had no aptitude. A one-act comedy, &quot;Le Café&quot;, failed in 1694, and he was not much happier with a more ambitious play, &quot;Le Flatteur&quot; (1696), or with the opera &quot;Venus et Adonis&quot; (1697). In 1700 he tried another comedy, &quot;Le Capricieux&quot;, which had the same fate. He then went with the duke of Tallard as an attaché to London, and, in days when literature still led to high position, seemed likely to achieve success.

His misfortunes began with a club squabble at the Café Laurent, which was much frequented by literary men, and where he indulged in lampoons on his companions. A shower of libellous and sometimes obscene verses was written by or attributed to him, and at last he was turned out of the café. At the same time his poems, as yet printed only singly or in manuscript, acquired him a great reputation, due to the dearth of genuine lyrical poetry between Jean Racine and André Chénier. In 1701 he was made a member of the Académie des inscriptions; he was offered, though he had not accepted, profitable places in the revenue department; he had become a favourite of the libertine but influential &quot;côterie&quot; of the Temple; and in 1710 he presented himself as a candidate for the Académie française.

Verses more offensive than ever were handed round, and gossip maintained that Rousseau was their author. Legal proceedings of various kinds followed, and Rousseau ascribed the lampoon to Bernard-Joseph Saurin. In 1712 Rousseau was prosecuted for defamation of character, and, on his non-appearance in court, was condemned to perpetual exile. He spent the rest of his life in foreign countries except for a clandestine visit to Paris in 1738; he refused to accept the permission to return which was offered him in 1716 because it was not accompanied by complete rehabilitation.

Prince Eugene of Savoy and other persons of distinction took him under their protection during his exile, and at Soleure he printed the first edition of his poetical works. He met Voltaire in Brussels in 1722. Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Le Pour et le contre&quot; is said to have shocked Rousseau, who expressed his sentiments freely. At any rate the latter had thenceforward no fiercer enemy than Voltaire. His death elicited from Jean-Jacques Lefranc, marquis de Pompignan an ode that was perhaps better than anything of Rousseau&#x27;s own work. That work may be roughly divided into two sections. One consists of formal and partly sacred odes and cantatas of the stiffest character, of which perhaps the &quot;Ode a la fortune&quot; is the most famous; the other of brief epigrams, sometimes licentious and always, or almost always, ill-natured.

As an epigrammatist Rousseau is inferior only to his friend Alexis Piron. The frigidity of conventional diction and the disuse of all really lyrical rhythm which characterize his period do not prevent his odes and cantatas from showing at times true poetical faculty, though cramped, and inadequate to explain his extraordinary vogue. Few writers were so frequently reprinted during the 18th century, but even in his own century La Harpe had arrived at a truer estimate of his real value when he said of his poetry: &quot;&quot;Le fond n&#x27;est qu&#x27;un lieu commun chargé de déclamations et même d&#x27;idées fausses&quot;.&quot;

Besides the Soleure edition mentioned above, Rousseau published an issue of his work in London in 1723.

<text>Ivor Keith Caplin (born 8 November 1958) is a British former Labour Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hove from 1997 to 2005.

==Early life==
Caplin was born in Brighton into a Jewish family and educated at the independent King Edward&#x27;s School, Witley and the Brighton College of Technology. He had a career in marketing with the Legal &amp; General Assurance Society from 1978 to 1997, from 1994 as Quality Manager in the Sales Division.

In 1991 he was elected to Hove Borough Council. In 1995, he led Labour&#x27;s successful campaign to win control of the council and became its Leader until April 1997, when it merged with Brighton. He was elected to the new Brighton and Hove Council in 1996 and was Deputy Leader until he resigned from the Council in March 1998.

==Parliamentary career==
Caplin, described as being from the centrist wing of the Labour Party, was elected as Member of Parliament for Hove in 1997, the city&#x27;s first gay MP. He became Parliamentary private secretary to Margaret Beckett in 1998.

Following re-election in 2001 Caplin became an Assistant Government Whip. He was a prominent supporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and refused to accept a 1,000 signature petition from constituents against the invasion, resulting in regular demonstrations outside his constituency office.

In June 2003 he was appointed Parliamentary under-secretary of state and Minister for Veterans at the Ministry of Defence. During his term, he introduced the Veteran&#x27;s Badge for those who had served in HM Armed Forces.

He was vice chairman of Labour Friends of Israel from 1997 to 2005.

He stood down from the House of Commons at the 2005 general election, following predictions he would lose the seat because of the strength of opposition in his constituency to the invasion of Iraq.

In 2010 Sir Thomas Legg conducted an independent audit of MPs&#x27; expenses in which he determined that Caplin should repay £17,865 representing mortgage interest payments claimed on his second home, after Caplin failed to provide paperwork to establish his entitlement to claim the money. Caplin appealed, stating that Legg&#x27;s letters had gone to an old address and had not been forwarded. On 1 April 2011 his appeal was upheld and the amount of repayment reduced to £1,178.43 (which Caplin had overclaimed due to interest rate fluctuations of which he was unaware); Caplin accepted the finding and agreed to repay the money.

==Post parliamentary career==
In December 2005, Caplin became a senior consultant for political lobbyists Foresight Communications, but was subsequently criticised by a Whitehall committee in 2006 for accepting lobbying work for the defence industry after being a defence minister without getting the agreement of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments.

In 2009 Caplin was appointed executive director of Haas Energy, a British company which hoped to obtain oil concessions in Iraq.

Caplin runs his own company Ivor Caplin Consultancy since 2005 which has various clients.

He was the Chair of the Jewish Labour Movement for 2018–2019.

== Suspension and arrest==
In June 2024 Caplin was suspended from the Labour Party due to &quot;serious allegations&quot; made about him. The allegations were not made public.

In January 2025 Caplin was arrested in Brighton by Sussex Police on suspicion of engaging in online sexual communications with a child, after being involved in an operation carried out by a group of anti-paedophile activists. He was released on bail until 11 April.

According to the &quot;Press Gazette&quot; &quot;The Ivor Caplin account on X has now been removed but up until [January 2025] it has been sharing, liking and interacting with posts showing explicit pornography – including pictures and videos of naked young people having sex&quot;. A Brighton-based journalist and former Labour member shared a screenshot in June 2024 of Caplin&#x27;s online activities, asking why Caplin was not questioned by the party about it. The journalist was visited by police in September 2024, declined a police caution, and was summoned to court under the Communications Act 2003.

<text>Sarah Jill &quot;Lalla&quot; Ward (born 28 June 1951) is an English actress, voice artist and author. She is best known for playing the role of Romana II in the BBC television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; from 1979 to 1981.

==Career==

===Early career===

Ward&#x27;s stage name, &quot;Lalla&quot;, originates from her attempts as a toddler to pronounce her own name. She left school at age 14 because she &quot;loathed every single minute of it&quot;, and took her O-levels on her own. Ward studied at the Central School of Speech and Drama from 1968 to 1971. After spending a few years painting, she auditioned at London drama schools &quot;as a sort of dare&quot; to herself: 

Ward began her acting career in the Hammer horror film &quot;Vampire Circus&quot; (1972), and played Lottie, the teenage daughter of Louisa Trotter (Gemma Jones) in &quot;The Duchess of Duke Street&quot;, the BBC drama series of the mid-1970s. She appeared in the films &quot;England Made Me&quot; (1973), &quot;Matushka&quot; (1973), &quot;Rosebud&quot; (1975), and &quot;Crossed Swords&quot; (or &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;) (1977). In 1974, she acted in a film called &quot;Got It Made&quot;, directed by James Kenelm Clarke. &quot;Club International&quot; magazine ran a set of nude pictures, claiming they were of her but actually featuring images from the 1978 film &quot;Sweet Virgin&quot;, and Ward successfully sued the magazine. Her television work included &quot;The Upper Crusts&quot; (1973) as the daughter of Margaret Leighton and Charles Gray, &quot;Van der Valk&quot; (1973), &quot;The Protectors&quot; (1973), &quot;Quiller&quot; (1975), &quot;Who Pays the Ferryman?&quot; (1977), as Jill Haydon, daughter of the underworld crime boss William Henry (Bill) Hayden in an episode of the hard-hitting British police drama &quot;The Professionals&quot;, the episode entitled &quot;When the Heat Cools Off&quot; (1978) and &quot;Hazell&quot; (1979). In 1980, she played Ophelia to Derek Jacobi&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; in the BBC television production.

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
She was the second actress to play the Time Lady Romana in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. After a guest appearance as Princess Astra in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Armageddon Factor&quot; in 1979, Ward was chosen to replace Mary Tamm, who had decided against continuing in the role. She appeared in all of Season 17&#x27;s stories and then her character was written out in the third to last story of Season 18 in the story entitled &quot;Warriors&#x27; Gate&quot;.

After &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, she appeared in the TV movie &quot;Schoolgirl Chums&quot; (1982), and &quot;The Jeweller&#x27;s Shop&quot; and &quot;The Rehearsal&quot; on stage. Ward decided to end her acting career after marrying Richard Dawkins. However, she has since reprised the character of Romana in the 1993 charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time,&quot; the 2003 webcast version of &quot;Shada&quot;, and in several &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Gallifrey&quot; audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions. She also played the &#x27;Mistress&#x27; opposite John Leeson&#x27;s &#x27;K-9&#x27; in two audio plays from BBV. In addition, she has appeared at a number of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; conventions and related special events. In November 2013 she appeared in the one-off 50th anniversary comedy homage &quot;The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot&quot;.

===Books===
Ward has recorded audio books, including Steven Pinker&#x27;s &quot;The Language Instinct&quot; and &quot;Shada&quot; by Gareth Roberts and Douglas Adams. She co-narrated &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, &quot;The Ancestor&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;The God Delusion&quot;, &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution&quot; with her then husband. In the 1980s. She also wrote two books on knitting and one on embroidery. Ward is a keen chef, and she contributed a recipe to &quot;The Doctor Who Cookbook&quot; which was edited by Gary Downie.

She also provided illustrations for &quot;Climbing Mount Improbable&quot; and &quot;Astrology for dogs (and owners)&quot; by William Fairchild (1980).

===Textiles and ceramics===
Ward is a textile artist and ceramicist. Her subjects are rare and endangered animals. She refers to her technique of creating fabric pictures as &quot;thread drawing&quot;, considering this a more accurate term for her work than the commonly used &quot;thread painting&quot;.

In 2009, at the suggestion of the Gerald Durrell Foundation, she prepared an exhibition of textiles and ceramics on the theme of Galapagos wildlife. The auction raised £24,000 for the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust&#x27;s campaign for the Floreana mockingbird and other wildlife of Galapagos.

She has shown three exhibitions at the National Theatre, London. Her 2010 textiles exhibition, &quot;Stranded&quot;, was inspired by the evolution of animals on islands. In 2011, &quot;Migration&quot; featured works which combined textiles and ceramics, the subjects seeming to move across both media. The theme of &quot;Vanishing Act&quot;, 2013, was camouflage. As with previous shows, Ward made available detailed instructions explaining her techniques. She also used one glass case to recreate her workspace, including such sources of inspiration as music, quotes, and a photo of her dog.

==Charity work==
Ward has served for almost 20 years on the committee of the Actors&#x27; Charitable Trust (TACT) and 10 years as a trustee.

==Personal life==
Ward was in a relationship with her co-star Tom Baker while working on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and they lived together in a flat in Deptford. The couple married in December 1980; however, the marriage lasted only 16 months. Ward attributed the separation to work commitments, different lifestyles and conflicts of interest. Regarding her marriage to Baker, Ward is quoted as saying: 

Ward said in 2004 that her long friendship with Douglas Adams, with whom she worked on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, meant more to her and was &quot;more valuable and more enduring&quot; than her marriage to Baker.

In 1992, at his 40th birthday party, Adams introduced her to his friend Richard Dawkins, the biologist and author of books including &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; and &quot;The God Delusion&quot;. Ward and Dawkins married later that year. In 2016, in a joint statement, the couple announced their amicable separation after 24 years of marriage.

In 2020, she married her third husband, Nicholas Rawlins.

===Family===
Sarah Ward is the daughter of Edward Ward, 7th Viscount Bangor, and his fourth wife, Marjorie Alice Banks, Lady Bangor; as such, she is entitled to use the courtesy title &quot;The Honourable&quot;. Her father was the BBC&#x27;s war correspondent in Finland at the beginning of the Second World War, while her mother was a writer and BBC producer specialising in dramatised documentaries. Her mother killed herself in July 1991.

She has a younger brother, Edward and an older half-brother, William, who is The 8th Viscount Bangor. Through her father, she is descended from The 1st Duke of Clarence, brother of Edward IV and Richard III, and from The 1st Earl of Peterborough, from The 1st Viscount Mordaunt, and from The 1st Viscount Bangor.

Her great-grandmother Mary Ward was an Anglo-Irish illustrator and amateur scientist, documented as the first person in the world to die in a motor vehicle accident.

<text>Genome projects are scientific endeavours that ultimately aim to determine the complete genome sequence of an organism (be it an animal, a plant, a fungus, a bacterium, an archaean, a protist or a virus) and to annotate protein-coding genes and other important genome-encoded features. The genome sequence of an organism includes the collective DNA sequences of each chromosome in the organism. For a bacterium containing a single chromosome, a genome project will aim to map the sequence of that chromosome. For the human species, whose genome includes 22 pairs of autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes, a complete genome sequence will involve 46 separate chromosome sequences.

The Human Genome Project is a well known example of a genome project.

==Genome assembly==
Genome assembly refers to the process of taking a large number of short DNA sequences and reassembling them to create a representation of the original chromosomes from which the DNA originated. In a shotgun sequencing project, all the DNA from a source (usually a single organism, anything from a bacterium to a mammal) is first fractured into millions of small pieces. These pieces are then &quot;read&quot; by automated sequencing machines. A genome assembly algorithm works by taking all the pieces and aligning them to one another, and detecting all places where two of the short sequences, or &quot;reads&quot;, overlap. These overlapping reads can be merged, and the process continues.

Genome assembly is a very difficult computational problem, made more difficult because many genomes contain large numbers of identical sequences, known as repeats. These repeats can be thousands of nucleotides long, and occur different locations, especially in the large genomes of plants and animals.

The resulting (draft) genome sequence is produced by combining the information sequenced contigs and then employing linking information to create scaffolds. Scaffolds are positioned along the physical map of the chromosomes creating a &quot;golden path&quot;.

===Assembly software===
Originally, most large-scale DNA sequencing centers developed their own software for assembling the sequences that they produced. However, this has changed as the software has grown more complex and as the number of sequencing centers has increased. An example of such assembler &quot;Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package&quot; developed by BGI for de novo assembly of human-sized genomes, alignment, SNP detection, resequencing, indel finding, and structural variation analysis.

==Genome annotation==

Since the 1980s, molecular biology and bioinformatics have created the need for DNA annotation. DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying attaching biological information to sequences, and particularly in identifying the locations of genes and determining what those genes do.

==Time of completion==
When sequencing a genome, there are usually regions that are difficult to sequence (often regions with highly repetitive DNA). Thus, &#x27;completed&#x27; genome sequences are rarely ever complete, and terms such as &#x27;working draft&#x27; or &#x27;essentially complete&#x27; have been used to more accurately describe the status of such genome projects. Even when every base pair of a genome sequence has been determined, there are still likely to be errors present because DNA sequencing is not a completely accurate process. It could also be argued that a complete genome project should include the sequences of mitochondria and (for plants) chloroplasts as these organelles have their own genomes.

It is often reported that the goal of sequencing a genome is to obtain information about the complete set of genes in that particular genome sequence. The proportion of a genome that encodes for genes may be very small (particularly in eukaryotes such as humans, where coding DNA may only account for a few percent of the entire sequence). However, it is not always possible (or desirable) to only sequence the coding regions separately. Also, as scientists understand more about the role of this noncoding DNA (often referred to as junk DNA), it will become more important to have a complete genome sequence as a background to understanding the genetics and biology of any given organism.

In many ways genome projects do not confine themselves to only determining a DNA sequence of an organism. Such projects may also include gene prediction to find out where the genes are in a genome, and what those genes do. There may also be related projects to sequence ESTs or mRNAs to help find out where the genes actually are.

==Historical and technological perspectives==
Historically, when sequencing eukaryotic genomes (such as the worm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;) it was common to first map the genome to provide a series of landmarks across the genome. Rather than sequence a chromosome in one go, it would be sequenced piece by piece (with the prior knowledge of approximately where that piece is located on the larger chromosome). Changes in technology and in particular improvements to the processing power of computers, means that genomes can now be &#x27;shotgun sequenced&#x27; in one go (there are caveats to this approach though when compared to the traditional approach).

Improvements in DNA sequencing technology have meant that the cost of sequencing a new genome sequence has steadily fallen (in terms of cost per base pair) and newer technology has also meant that genomes can be sequenced far more quickly.

When research agencies decide what new genomes to sequence, the emphasis has been on species which are either high importance as model organism or have a relevance to human health (e.g. pathogenic bacteria or vectors of disease such as mosquitos) or species which have commercial importance (e.g. livestock and crop plants). Secondary emphasis is placed on species whose genomes will help answer important questions in molecular evolution (e.g. the common chimpanzee).

In the future, it is likely that it will become even cheaper and quicker to sequence a genome. This will allow for complete genome sequences to be determined from many different individuals of the same species. For humans, this will allow us to better understand aspects of human genetic diversity.

<doc id="323793" wikidata="Q323047" url="?curid=323793" title="Abortifacient">
<text>An abortifacient (&quot;that which will cause a miscarriage&quot; from Latin: &quot;&quot; &quot;miscarriage&quot; and &quot;&quot; &quot;making&quot;) is a substance that induces abortion. This is a nonspecific term which may refer to any number of substances or medications, ranging from herbs to prescription medications.

Common abortifacients used in performing medical abortions include mifepristone, which is typically used in conjunction with misoprostol in a two-step approach. Synthetic oxytocin, which is routinely used safely during term labor, is also commonly used to induce abortion in the second or third trimester.

For thousands of years, writers in many parts of the world have described and recommended herbal abortifacients to women who seek to terminate a pregnancy, although their use may carry risks to the health of the woman.

== Medications ==

Because &quot;abortifacient&quot; is a broad term used to describe a substance&#x27;s effects on pregnancy, there is a wide range of drugs that can be described as abortifacients or as having abortifacient properties.

The most commonly recommended medication regimen for intentionally inducing abortion involves the use of mifepristone followed by misoprostol 1–2 days later. The use of these medications for the purpose of ending a pregnancy has been extensively studied, and has been shown to be both effective and safe with fewer than 0.4% of patients needing hospitalization to treat an infection or to receive a blood transfusion. This combination is approved for use up to 10 weeks&#x27; gestation (70 days after the start of the last menstrual period).

Other drugs with abortifacient properties can have multiple uses. Both synthetic oxytocin (Pitocin) and dinoprostone (Cervidil, Prepidil) are routinely used during healthy, term labor. Pitocin is used to induce and strengthen contractions, and Cervidil is used to prepare the cervix for labor by inducing softening and widening of this opening to the uterus. When used this way, neither medication is considered an abortifacient. However, the same drugs can be used to induce an abortion, particularly after 12 weeks of pregnancy. Misoprostol (discussed above) is also used to treat peptic ulcers in patients who have had gastric or intestinal damage from use of NSAIDs. Because its use in treatment of ulcers makes it easier to access, misoprostol alone is sometimes used for self-induced abortion in countries or regions where legal abortion is not available or readily accessible.

Not all abortifacient agents are taken with the intention to end a pregnancy. Methotrexate, a drug often used for management of rheumatoid arthritis, can induce abortion. For this reason contraception is often advised while using methotrexate for management of a chronic condition.

Sometimes herbal medicines are used in an attempt to induce abortion. In general, a dose sufficient to be effective poses a risk to the mother because of potential liver and kidney damage; failed attempts may require a follow-up clinical abortion because the uterus did not evacuate completely.

Some drugs that are not abortifacients, such as levonorgestrel, are referred to as abortifacients.

== History ==

The medical literature of classical antiquity often refers to pharmacological means of abortion; abortifacients are mentioned, and sometimes described in detail, in the works of Aristotle, Caelius Aurelianus, Celsus, Dioscorides, Galen, Hippocrates, Oribasius, Paul of Aegina, Pliny, Theodorus Priscianus, Soranus of Ephesus, and others.

In ancient Babylonian texts, scholars have described multiple written prescriptions or instructions for ending pregnancies. Some of these instructions were explicitly for ingesting ingredients to end a pregnancy, whereas other cuneiform texts discuss the ingestion of ingredients to return a missed menstrual period (which is used repeatedly throughout history as a coded reference to abortion). 
The ancient Greek colony of Cyrene at one time had an economy based almost entirely on the production and export of the plant silphium, which had uses ranging from food to a salve for feral dog bites. It was also considered a powerful abortifacient used to &quot;purge the uterus&quot;. Silphium figured so prominently in the wealth of Cyrene that the plant appeared on coins minted there.

In the Bible, Biblical scholars and learned Biblical commentators view the ordeal of the bitter water (prescribed for a &quot;sotah&quot;, or a wife whose husband suspects that she was unfaithful to him) as referring to the use of abortifacients to terminate her pregnancy. The wife drinks &quot;water of bitterness,&quot; which, if she is guilty, causes the abortion or miscarriage of a pregnancy she may be carrying. The Biblical scholar Tikva Frymer-Kensky has disputed the interpretation that the ordeal of the bitter water referred to the use of abortifacients.

The medieval Islamic physician Ibn Sina documented various birth control practices, including the use of rue as an abortifacient. Similarly, 11th-century physician Constantine the African described multiple abortifacient herbs, which he classified by order of their intensity, starting with abortifacients that had weaker effects on the body and ending with the most potent substances.

Carl Linnaeus, known as the &quot;father of botany&quot;, listed five abortifacients in his 1749 &quot;Materia medica&quot;. According to the historian of science Londa Schiebinger, in the 17th and 18th centuries &quot;many sources taken together – herbals, midwifery manuals, trial records, &quot;Pharmacopoeia&quot;, and &quot;Materia medica&quot; – reveal that physicians, midwives, and women themselves had an extensive knowledge of herbs that could induce abortion.&quot; Schiebinger further writes that &quot;European exploration in the West Indies yielded about a dozen known abortifacients.&quot;

For Aboriginal people in Australia, plants such as giant boat-lip orchid (&quot;Cymbidium madidum&quot;), quinine bush (&quot;Petalostigma pubescens&quot;), or blue-leaved mallee (&quot;Eucalyptus gamophylla&quot;) were ingested, inserted into the body, or were smoked with Cooktown ironwood (&quot;Erythrophleum chlorostachys&quot;).

Historically, the First Nations people of eastern Canada used &quot;Sanguinaria canadensis&quot; (bloodwort) and &quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot; to induce abortions.

According to Virgil Vogel, a historian of the indigenous societies of North America, the Ojibwe used blue cohosh (&quot;Caulophyllum thalictroides&quot;) as an abortifacient, and the Quinault used thistle for the same purpose. The appendix to Vogel&#x27;s book lists red cedar (&quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot;), American pennyroyal (&quot;Hedeoma pulegioides&quot;), tansy, Canada wild ginger (&quot;Asarum canadense&quot;), and several other herbs as abortifacients used by various North American Indian tribes. The anthropologist Daniel Moerman wrote that calamus (&quot;Acorus calamus&quot;), which was one of the ten most common medicinal drugs of Native American societies, was used as an abortifacient by the Lenape, Cree, Mohegan, Sioux, and other tribes; and he listed more than one hundred substances used as abortifacients by Native Americans.

Following a tradition among European and English authors, colonial Americans were advised by Benjamin Franklin to use careful measurements in his recipe for an abortifacient that he used as an example in a book he published to teach mathematics and many useful skills.

The historian Angus McLaren, writing about Canadian women between 1870 and 1920, states that &quot;A woman would first seek to &#x27;put herself right&#x27; by drinking an infusion of one of the traditional abortifacients, such as tansy, quinine, pennyroyal, rue, black hellebore, ergot of rye, sabin, or cotton root.&quot;

During the American slavery period, 18th and 19th centuries, cotton root bark was used in folk remedies to induce a miscarriage.

In the late 19th century, women in the UK and US increasingly ingested lead to abort pregnancies, sometimes in the form of pills made of diachylon or lead plaster. It would often cause the women to become ill and could kill them.

In the 19th century Madame Restell provided mail-order abortifacients and surgical abortion to pregnant clients in New York.

Early 20th-century newspaper advertisements included coded advertisements for abortifacient substances which would solve menstrual &quot;irregularities.&quot; Between 1919 and 1934 the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued legal restraints against fifty-seven &quot;feminine hygiene products&quot; including &quot;Blair&#x27;s Female Tablets&quot; and &quot;Madame LeRoy&#x27;s Regulative Pills.&quot;

=== Quickening ===
For much of history, ending a pregnancy prior to &quot;quickening&quot; (the moment when a pregnant woman first feels fetal movement) did not have the type of legal or political restrictions and taboos found in the 21st century. Early medieval laws did not discuss abortion prior to quickening. The early Catholic church held that human life began at &quot;ensoulment&quot; (at the time of quickening), a continuation of Roman norms and positions on the use of abortifacients prior to quickening.

In English law, abortion did not become illegal until 1803. &quot;Women who took drugs before that time [quickening] would describe their actions as &#x27;restoring the menses&#x27; or &#x27;bringing on a period&#x27;.&quot;

At that time, abortion after quickening became subject to the death penalty. In 1837, the significance of quickening was removed, but the death penalty was also abandoned.

<text>Mesannepada (, [MES-AN-NE2-PAD3-DA]), Mesh-Ane-pada or Mes-Anne-pada (died c. 2525 BC) (&quot;Youngling chosen by An&quot;; -2525 BC ) was the first king listed for the First Dynasty of Ur (c. 26th century BC) on the Sumerian king list. He is listed to have ruled for 80 years, having overthrown Lugal-kitun of Uruk: &quot;Then Unug (Uruk) was defeated and the kingship was taken to Urim (Ur)&quot;. In one of his seals, found in the Royal Cemetery at Ur, he is also described as king of Kish.

==Filiation==
===The &quot;Treasure of Ur&quot; discovered in Mari===

Mesannepada was a son of Meskalamdug. A lapis-lazuli bead with the name of King Meskalamdug was found in Mari, in the so-called &quot;Treasure of Ur&quot;, and reads:

Initially, it was thought that this bead (reference M. 4439) referred to a gift by Mesannepada to a king of Mari named Gansud or Ansud. This has now been corrected with the translation given above. The God &quot;Lugal-kalam&quot; (, &quot;Lord of the Land&quot;) to whom the dedication is made, is otherwise known in a dedication by a local ruler Šaba (Šalim) of Mari, also as Lugal-kalam, or in the dedication of Ishtup-Ilum where he is named &quot;Lugal-mātim&quot; (, &quot;Lord of the Land&quot;), and is considered identical with the local deity Dagan, or Enlil. 

It is unclear how this bead came to be in Mari, but this points to some kind of relation between Ur and Mari at that time. The bead was discovered in a jar containing other objects from Ur or Kish, the so-called &quot;Treasure of Ur&quot;. The jar was recognized as an offering for the foundation of a temple in Mari. Similar dedication beads have also been found from later rulers, such as Shulgi who engraved two carnelian beads with dedication to his gods .

===A&#x27;annepada dedication tablet===

Several dedication tablets by &quot;A&#x27;annepada, son of Mesannepada&quot; for the god Ninhursag are also known, which all have similar content:

===Sumerian King List===
Mesannepada appears in the Sumerian King List, as the first ruler of the First Dynasty of Ur, and is credited with a reign of 80 years. His successors are also named:

It is considered unlikely for a king to inherit a throne in his childhood and reign thereafter for 80 years. The length of the son&#x27;s reign was probably added to that of the father.

===Old Babylonian tablet: the Tummal Chronicle===
Mesannepada and his other son are also mentioned in an Old Babylonian tablet (1900-1600 BC), the Tummal Inscription, relating the accomplishments of several kings. Such tablets are usually copies of older tablets, now lost:

==Reign==
Mesannepada is associated with an expansion of Ur, at least diplomatically. A lapis-lazuli bead in the name of Mesannepada was found in Mari, and formed part of the &quot;Treasure of Ur&quot;, made for the dedication of a temple in Mari. Seals from the royal cemetery at Ur have also been found bearing the names of Mesannepada and his predecessors Meskalamdug and Akalamdug, along with Queen Puabi. A seal impression in the name of &quot;Mesannepada, king of Kish&quot; was found in the Royal Cemetery at Ur.


Mesannepada, and his son and successor Meskiagnun, who reigned 36 years, are both named on the &quot;Tummal Inscription&quot; as upkeepers of the main temple in Nippur along with Gilgamesh of Uruk and his son Ur-Nungal, verifying their status as overlords of Sumer. Judging from the inscriptions, Mesannepada then assumed the title &quot;King of Kish&quot;, to indicate his hegemony.

Another son of Mesannepada, named Aannepadda, (Aja-ane-pada or A-Anne-pada, &quot;father chosen by An&quot;), whose years of reigned are unknown, is known for having the temple of Ninhursag constructed (at modern Ubaid) near &quot;el-Obed&quot;, though he is not named on the kinglist.

A small ziggurat beneath the structure built at Ur by Ur-Nammu may date back to the time of Mes-Anne-pada.

In the 1950s, Edmund I. Gordon conjectured that Mesannepada, and an archaeologically attested early &quot;king of Kish&quot;, Mesilim, were one and the same, as their names were interchanged in certain proverbs in later Babylonian tablets; however this has not proved conclusive. More recent scholars tend to regard them as distinct, usually placing Mesilim in Kish before Mesannepada.

==Royal Cemetery of Ur==
Mesannapeda&#x27;s tomb may have been located in the Royal Cemetery at Ur. It has been suggested that tomb PG 1232, or PG 1237, nicknamed &quot;the Great Death-Pit,&quot; might belong to him.

<doc id="323818" wikidata="Q106303" url="?curid=323818" title="Daniel Auteuil">
<text>Daniel Auteuil (; born 24 January 1950) is a French actor and director who has appeared in a wide range of film genres, including period dramas, romantic comedies, and crime thrillers. In 1996 he won the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival together with Belgian actor Pascal Duquenne. He is also the winner of two César Awards for Best Actor, one in 1987 as Ugolin Soubeyran in &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; and &quot;Manon des Sources&quot; and one for his role in &quot;Girl on the Bridge&quot;. For his role in &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; he also won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Auteuil is considered one of France&#x27;s most respected actors.

==Early life==
Daniel Auteuil was born on 24 January 1950 in Algiers, French Algeria, the son of opera singers. He grew up in Avignon and Nancy, France. He began his acting career in musical comedy and made his film debut in 1972.

At age 16, thanks to André Benedetto, who led a company in Avignon, Auteuil began stage acting in Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;La Demande en mariage&quot;. To please his parents he began studies in topography, and he worked in a nightclub cloakroom on Saturday nights to earn money.

In 1969, after attending high school in Avignon, he went to Paris with his friend Roger Miremont. He enrolled in a theatre course taught by Cours Florent. Despite several attempts, he was never accepted to the Conservatoire national supérieur d&#x27;art dramatique.

==Career==
In 1970, he made his debut in théâtre national populaire in &quot;Early Morning&quot;. In 1972 and 1973 he appeared in the American musical &quot;Godspell&quot;. Partnered with Edwige Feuillère&#x27;s theatre (&quot;La folle de Chaillot&quot;) and Maria Pacôme&#x27;s theatre (&quot;Apprends-moi, Céline&quot;), he co-starred with François Périer in &quot;Coup de chapeau&quot;, which earned him the 1979 Gérard Philipe prize for the best actor in Parisian theatre of the year. He then appeared in &quot;Le Garçon d&#x27;appartement&quot;, which Gérard Lauzier adapted for the cinema in 1982 as &quot;T&#x27;empêches tout le monde de dormir&quot;.

In 1974, Auteuil made his debut on television under the direction of Marcel Jullian in the series &quot;Les Fargeot&quot; before continuing next to Rellys, Jackie Sardou and Fernand Sardou in &quot;Adieu Amélie&quot; by Jean-Paul Carrère. In 1977, he played the detective Camaret in the six-episode series &quot;Rendez-vous en noir&quot;, based on the novel by William Irish.

In 1975, Gérard Pirès offered Auteuil the lead role in &quot;L&#x27;Agression&quot; with Catherine Deneuve and Jean-Louis Trintignant.

Auteuil&#x27;s starring role in the historical drama film &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; (1986) and its sequel &quot;Manon des Sources&quot; (1986) brought him international recognition. Auteuil has since become one of the best-known, best-paid and most popular actors in France. Through his appearances in films including the swashbuckler &quot;Le bossu&quot; (1997), the comedy &quot;The Closet&quot; (2001), the romantic comedy &quot;After You...&quot; (2003), the thriller &quot;Caché&quot; (2005) and the comedy &quot;My Best Friend&quot; (2006), he has since gained greater international recognition.

In 2013, Auteuil was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

==Personal life==
Auteuil has two daughters: Aurore Auteuil with his former partner, Anne Jousset, and Nelly from a ten-year relationship with actress Emmanuelle Béart, his co-star in the films &quot;A Heart in Winter&quot; and &quot;Manon des Sources&quot; (1986). He married Aude Ambroggi, a Corsican sculptor born in 1977, on 22 July 2006 in Porto-Vecchio, Corsica.

<doc id="323822" wikidata="Q5357197" url="?curid=323822" title="Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories">
<text>Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories are broadly similar to the electoral system used in federal elections in Australia.

When the Australian colonies were granted responsible government in the 19th century, the constitutions of each colony introduced bicameral parliaments, each of which was based on the contemporaneous version of the Westminster system. In these parliaments, a lower house (often known as the legislative assembly) was composed of multiple single-member, geographical constituencies. Suffrage was extended only to adult males, with some states including a property criterion. In Queensland and Western Australia the vote was specifically denied to people of indigenous Australian descent. Despite these forms of discrimination, the s of Australian lower houses were, paradoxically, socially broader than those existing in most other countries at the time. However, in each colony an upper house (usually known as the legislative council) continued to be composed of members that were nominated by the governor of each colony and/or were elected under a restricted franchise that usually included a property qualification. This ensured that each upper house continued to be unrepresentative and dominated by wealthy landholders.

Before or soon after Federation in 1901, women of European descent received voting rights, at different times in each colony/state. While the abolition of the upper houses was often proposed, the only instance in which this occurred was Queensland, which became unicameral in 1922 (when the Legislative Council of Queensland was abolished). Gradually the various upper houses became directly-elected and property qualifications were removed. Indigenous Australians received the right to vote at different times in different states. In 1964, Western Australia removed restrictions on the voting rights of indigenous people and abolished the property qualification for the Legislative Council of Western Australia. The following year Queensland became the last state to lift restrictions on people voting, based on indigenous descent.

The Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory were directly administered by the federal government until 1974 and 1989 respectively. Both now have, like Queensland, unicameral parliaments.

== Conduct of elections ==
State and local government elections, by-elections and referendums are overseen by Electoral Commissions in each state and territory, as follows: 
* New South Wales – New South Wales Electoral Commission
* Queensland – Electoral Commission of Queensland
* Victoria – Victorian Electoral Commission
* South Australia – Electoral Commission of South Australia
* Tasmania – Tasmanian Electoral Commission
* Western Australia – Western Australian Electoral Commission
* Northern Territory – Northern Territory Electoral Commission, and 
* Australian Capital Territory – Australian Capital Territory Electoral Commission

== Date of elections ==
By federal law, state elections cannot take place on the same day as a federal election, which takes precedence if there is a conflict of dates. Federal elections have been held on a Saturday since the 1913 federal election.

All state and territory lower houses have four-year terms, and all mainland states and territories terms are fixed and determined by statute.

In New South Wales, elections are held on the last Saturday in March every 4th year, with the last election being on 25 March 2023, and the next election due on 27 March 2027. In Victoria, elections are held on the last Saturday in November every 4th year. The last election was on 26 November 2022, and the next election will be held on 28 November 2026. Prior to the 2006 Victorian election, Victorian parliamentary elections could be held any time at the discretion of the government in the last year of their four-year term of office. This meant that, in practice, the average period between elections was somewhat less than the maximum four years.

Queensland holds elections every 4th year on the last Saturday in October with the most recent election held on 31 October 2020. In Western Australia, elections are held every 4th year on the second Saturday in March with the next election due in March 2025.

In South Australia, section 28 of the Constitution Act 1934, as amended in 2001, directs elections must be held on the third Saturday in March every four years unless this date falls the day after Good Friday, occurs within the same month as a Commonwealth election, or the conduct of the election could be adversely affected by a state disaster. The timing of the Tasmanian lower house election is determined by the premier of Tasmania.

==Electoral systems used==
Of Australia&#x27;s six states and two territories, four use STV for election of members of their upper house. One uses alternative voting (Instant-runoff voting). (Three are unicameral so have no upper house.)

Of Australia&#x27;s six states and two territories, two use STV for election of members of their lower house. The rest use alternative voting (Instant-runoff voting). (see &quot;Summary&quot; below.)

==Australian Capital Territory==
In the Australian Capital Territory, the Legislative Assembly originally had 17 members from three electorates; at the 2016 election this was increased to 25 members from five electorates. Members are elected for four-year terms, each electing five members under a form of STV proportional representation system, known as the Hare-Clark system. The system was introduced at the 1995 election.

Casual vacancies are filled by the &#x27;countback&#x27; method, which involves recounting the original ballot papers to elect one of the candidates who stood but failed to be elected in the last election.

===Nomination===
Nomination as a candidate requires the following: 
*an Australian citizen, and
*18 years old, and
*qualified to be an elector in the ACT (that is, you have lived in the ACT for at least one month).

==New South Wales==
Elections in New South Wales are conducted by the New South Wales Electoral Commission as prescribed in the .

===Legislative Assembly===
The New South Wales Legislative Assembly has 93 members elected for four-year terms in single-member electoral districts. The method of election is optional preferential voting, (also known as instant run-off voting). The voting system is the same as for the federal House of Representatives except that in New South Wales the voter may choose how many candidate preferences to allocate beyond their primary vote. This means that while voters may number every candidate if they wish, their vote is still formal if they choose not to. They may vote for one candidate only, or for as many candidates as they choose, provided that they number them in correct sequence.

The NSW Electoral Commission determines electoral boundaries using a distribution process which provides for an approximate equal number of electors in each electoral district; with a margin of allowance of plus or minus 10% of the average enrolment.

===Legislative Council===
The New South Wales Legislative Council has 42 members elected for eight-year terms, one-half of the body being elected every four years, using the single transferable vote method, a form of preferential voting for use with proportional representation. The NSW constitution requires voters to express preferences for at least 15 candidates on the ballot – either through numbering individual candidates or at least one &quot;above the line&quot; vote – however preferences after this point are optional.

Since its formation in 1855, the Council has had three different methods of election (or appointment). 
# From 1855 to 1933 its members were appointed by the Governor, and the Council had no fixed size. In the early part of this period the Governor exercised a personal discretion in appointing members, but once the convention became established that the Governor acted only on the advice of the Premier, this meant that the Council was in effect appointed by the Premier.
# By the 1920s this was felt to be undemocratic and undesirable, so in 1933 the method of choosing members of the Council was changed by referendum. From 1933 to 1978, the Council consisted of 60 members, chosen for 12-year terms by single transferable vote in a secret ballot of both Houses of the Parliament (all Members of the Legislative Assembly and the 45 non-retiring Members of the Legislative Council). One-quarter of the members of the Council (15 of 60) came up for re-election every three years. This meant in practice that the party composition of the Council reflected that of the Assembly, with a lag of some years.
# In 1978 Neville Wran&#x27;s Labor government reformed the Council, again by referendum. Since that time the Council has been elected by the people by STV proportional representation, with the whole state voting as one electorate. 
# In 1978 the size of the Council was reduced to 45 members, serving nine-year terms, with one third of the members coming up for election every three years. When the term of the Legislative Assembly was extended from three years to four in 1984, terms of the Council were consequently extended to twelve years. At another referendum in 1991, the membership of the Council was reduced again to its current size, and the current system of eight-year terms, with elections every four years, was introduced, 21 (half the council) are elected at each election. (Whole-vote method transferring only surplus votes are used in cases where candidate is elected with surplus votes.)
# The existence of the Legislative Council, its powers, and fixed four-year terms for both houses are all entrenched in the NSW Constitution Act, and none can be changed except by referendum.

Council elections use &quot;above the line&quot; ballot papers, but a vote above the line equates to voting for candidates in one group – there are no group voting tickets as there are in Victoria.

===Nomination===
Nomination as a candidate requires the following: 
* the candidate must be over 18 years of age, and must be enrolled to vote in New South Wales, although not necessarily be a resident of the electorate for which they are nominating,
* a nomination form signed by the candidate and either by 15 electors enrolled in the electoral district to be contested or the Registered Officer of a political party, and
* to pay a deposit of $250 (Legislative Assembly) or $500 (Legislative Council), which is returned if the candidate gains at least 4% of the first preference vote.

==Northern Territory==

===Legislative Assembly===
The Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has 25 members elected for four-year terms from single-member constituencies under the same preferential form of the Alternative Vote used for the House of Representatives. The voting method changed in February 2016 from full-preferential voting to optional preferential voting. The Territory has never had an upper house.

===Nomination===
Nomination as a candidate requires the following: 
* an Australian citizen
* a resident within the Commonwealth for at least 6 months and within the Territory for at least 3 months.
* the candidate must be over 18 years of age,
* a nomination form signed by the candidate and either by 6 electors or the Registered Officer of a political party (registration of a party requires 200 members), and
* to pay a deposit of $200, which is returned if the candidate gains at least 20% of first preference vote.

==Queensland==
Elections in Queensland are conducted by the Electoral Commission of Queensland.

===Legislative Assembly===
The Legislative Assembly of Queensland has 93 members elected for fixed four-year terms from single-member constituencies using full-preferential voting. The Queensland Legislative Council, which consisted of members nominated by the Governor, was abolished by a Labor government in 1922.

Queensland has used the alternative vote since 1962. It used the &#x27;first past the post&#x27; (plurality) system from 1860 to 1892. From then until 1942 an unusual form of preferential voting called the contingent vote was used. In 1942 the plurality system was reintroduced until it was replaced in 1962 by the &#x27;full preferential&#x27; form of the alternative vote. From 1992 until 2016 the optional preferential system was used.

===Nomination===
Nomination as a candidate requires the following:
* the candidate must be over 18 years of age,
* a nomination form signed by the candidate and either by 6 electors or the Registered Officer of a political party (registration of a party requires 500 members), and
* to pay a deposit of $250, which is returned if the candidate gains at least 4% of first preference vote.

==South Australia==
Elections in South Australia are conducted by the Electoral Commission of South Australia. The Electoral Act stipulates that the election campaign must run for a minimum of 25 days and a maximum of 55 days. Like all other states and territories voting in South Australia is compulsory, however unlike other states initial enrolment is not compulsory so a voter could theoretically not be compelled to vote if they chose never to enrol.

===House of Assembly===
The South Australian House of Assembly has 47 members elected under the preferential Instant-runoff voting (IRV) system. If on the count of primary or first preference votes (votes marked with the number &#x27;1&#x27;), no candidate achieves more than 50% of the vote, the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded and their votes distributed according to the next available preferences, their 2nd or 3rd choice candidate. This process of exclusion continues until one candidate achieves 50% of the vote.

Group voting tickets were abolished for both houses of the South Australian parliament in 2018.

===Legislative Council===
The South Australian Legislative Council has 22 members elected under the preferential single transferable voting system. Following the similar Senate changes which took effect from the 2016 federal election, as of the 2018 state election, South Australia&#x27;s single transferable vote in the proportionally represented upper house was changed from group voting tickets to optional preferential voting − instructions for above the line votes are to mark &#x27;1&#x27; and then further preferences are optional as opposed to preference flows from simply &#x27;1&#x27; above the line being determined by group voting tickets, while instructions for voters who instead opt to vote below the line are to provide at least 12 preferences as opposed to having to number all candidates, and with a savings provision to admit ballot papers which indicate at least 6 below the line preferences.

The ECSA is responsible for a mandatory redistribution of House of Assembly boundaries before each election to ensure one vote one value.

Turnout rates are above 90%. Informal voting, which occurs when a voting slip is not valid, is at a rate of under 5%. Voting slips are informal when they are not filled out correctly, such examples are not numbering subsequent numbers, not filling out all the candidate boxes with numbers (except the last candidate), or in some other way that is verified by the State Electoral Office as illegible. South Australian elections have some features that are unique to the rest of Australia.

===Nomination===
Nomination as a candidate requires the following:
* the candidate must be over 18 years of age,
* a nomination form signed by the candidate and either by 2 electors or the Registered Officer of a political party (registration of a party requires 150 members), and
* to pay a deposit of a &quot;prescribed amount&quot;.

==Tasmania==
Elections in Tasmania are conducted by the Tasmanian Electoral Commission.

===House of Assembly===
The Tasmanian House of Assembly (the lower house) has 35 members, elected for four-year terms from five multi-member constituencies, each electing seven members by STV proportional representation. Tasmania is the only State to use proportional representation to elect its lower house, although it is also used in the Australian Capital Territory. Tasmania uses a form of STV known as the Hare-Clark system, which was introduced in 1909. Casual vacancies are filled by the &#x27;countback&#x27; method, which involves recounting the original ballot papers to elect one of the candidates who stood but failed to be elected in the last election.

===Legislative Council===
The Tasmanian Legislative Council (the upper house) has 15 members, each representing one of 15 electoral divisions. Elections are conducted on a 6-year periodic cycle. Elections for 3 members are held in May one year, with elections for 2 members held in May the following year and so on. Legislative Council elections use the same full preferential voting system used for the federal House of Representatives. Elections are held on the first Saturday in May each year.

Until recently Tasmania required voters to be residents of the State for at least six months before they were eligible to enrol and vote. This is no longer the case, bringing Tasmania into line with other states and the federal position.

===Nomination===
Nomination as a candidate requires the following:
* the candidate must be over 18 years of age, and must be enrolled to vote in Tasmania, although not necessarily be a resident of the electorate for which they are nominating,
* a nomination form signed by the candidate and either by 10 electors or the Registered Officer of a political party, and
* to pay a deposit of $400, which is returned if the candidate gains at least 20% of a quota at time of exclusion.

==Victoria==
Elections in Victoria are conducted by the Victorian Electoral Commission.

===Legislative Assembly===
The Victorian Legislative Assembly (lower house) has 88 members elected from single-member electorates (districts) under a preferential voting system, the same system used for the federal House of Representatives. Eleven districts are created in each Legislative Council region. Casual vacancies are filled by by-elections.

===Legislative Council===
The Victorian Legislative Council (upper house) has 40 members, with 5 members elected from each of the 8 regions. Five regions are urban (Eastern Metropolitan Region, Northern Metropolitan Region, South Eastern Metropolitan Region, Southern Metropolitan Region, and Western Metropolitan Region) and three are non-urban (Eastern Victoria Region, Northern Victoria Region and Western Victoria Region). A proportional voting system is used, with each member requiring a quota of the vote to be elected. Casual vacancies are filled by an appointment.

In 2003, the Bracks government changed the method of electing members of the Legislative Council. Before 2006, the Council had 44 members from 22 constituencies known as provinces, each elected for two terms at alternating elections.

Group voting tickets have been used since 1988.

===Nomination===
Nomination as a candidate requires the following: 
* the candidate must be over 18 years of age, and must be enrolled to vote in Victoria, although not necessarily be a resident of the electorate for which they are nominating,
* a nomination form signed by the candidate and either by six electors or the Registered Officer of a political party, and
* payment of a deposit of $350 (Assembly) or $700 (Council), which is returned if the candidate gains at least 4% of the first preference vote.

==Western Australia==

===Legislative Assembly===
The Western Australian Legislative Assembly has 59 members elected for four-year terms from single-member constituencies under the alternative vote form of preferential voting. The voting system is the full preferential system used for the House of Representatives.

===Legislative Council===
From 1986 to 2009, the Western Australian Legislative Council had 34 members elected for four-year terms from six multi-member constituencies known as regions, by STV proportional representation. Four regions elect five members while two regions elect seven members. As in the Assembly, the regions are deliberately malapportioned in favour of country areas. Now, since the Legislative Council, elected on 6 September 2008 and commencing office on 22 May 2009, each region is represented by six members, making a total Council of 36.

A recount method is used to fill mid-term vacancies in the Legislative Council. All ballots from the original election are recounted, with preferences for the vacating member ignored. If a candidate not participating in the recount would be elected, the count is restarted and their preferences are also ignored, until a participating candidate is elected. This is slightly different from the &quot;Countback&quot; method used to fill vacancies in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. However, like the Tasmanian system, legislation provides for the ability to call a by-election if the party the vacating member stood for at the original election does not have any qualifying candidates – for instance, if all of their candidates at the original election were elected.

Group voting tickets were introduced in 1987 and abolished in 2021.

===Nomination===
Nomination as a candidate requires the following:
* the candidate must have resided in Western Australia for at least one year.
* the candidate must be an Australian citizen.
* the candidate must be over 18 years of age,
* a nomination form signed by the candidate or the Registered Officer of a political party (registration of a party requires 500 members), and
* to pay a deposit of $250, which is returned if the candidate gains at least 5% of the first preference vote, or if a group gains 10% of the first preference votes.

==Summary==

===Lower houses===
===Upper houses===
Note (1) : Queensland and the two territories are unicameral, and do not have an upper house.
Note (2) : Under inclusive Gregory method, transfer value equals (surplus / total papers received by the elected candidate). Under weighted inclusive Gregory method, transfer value equals [current transfer value x (surplus / total votes received by the elected candidate)].

<text>Skinks are a type of lizard belonging to the family Scincidae, a family in the infraorder Scincomorpha. With more than 1,500 described species across 100 different taxonomic genera, the family Scincidae is one of the most diverse families of lizards. Skinks are characterized by their smaller legs in comparison to typical lizards and are found in different habitats except arctic and subarctic regions.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;skink&quot;, which entered the English language around 1580–1590, comes from classical Greek and Latin , names that referred to various specific lizards.

==Description==
Skinks look like lizards of the family Lacertidae (sometimes called &quot;true lizards&quot;), but most species of skinks have no pronounced neck and relatively small legs. Several genera (e.g., &quot;Typhlosaurus&quot;) have no limbs at all. This is not true for all skinks, however, as some species such as the red-eyed crocodile skink have a head that is very distinguished from the body. These lizards also have legs that are relatively small proportional to their body size.

Skinks&#x27; skulls are covered by substantial bony scales, usually matching up in shape and size, while overlapping. Other genera, such as &quot;Neoseps&quot;, have reduced limbs and fewer than five toes (digits) on each foot. In such species, their locomotion resembles that of snakes more than that of lizards with well-developed limbs. As a general rule, the longer the digits, the more arboreal the species is likely to be. A biological ratio can determine the ecological niche of a given skink species. The Scincidae ecological niche index (SENI) is a ratio based on anterior foot length at the junction of the ulna/radius-carpal bones to the longest digit divided by the .

Most species of skinks have long, tapering tails they can shed if predators grab onto them. Such species generally can regenerate the lost part of a tail, though imperfectly. A lost tail can grow back within around three to four months. Species with stumpy tails have no special regenerative abilities.

Some species of skinks are quite small; &quot;Scincella lateralis&quot; typically ranges from , more than half of which is the tail. Most skinks, though, are medium-sized, with snout-to-vent lengths around , although some grow larger; the Solomon Islands skink (&quot;Corucia zebrata&quot;) is the largest known extant species and may attain a snout-to-vent length of some .

Skinks can often hide easily in their habitat because of their protective colouring (camouflage).

===Blood color ===
Skinks in the genus &quot;Prasinohaema&quot; have green blood because of a buildup of the waste product biliverdin.

== Evolutionary history ==
The oldest known skink is &quot;Electroscincus zedi&quot; described from the mid-Cretaceous (late Albian to early Cenomanian) Burmese amber from Myanmar, dating to around . Based on the presence of osteoderms, &quot;Electroscincus&quot; appears to belong to the Scincidae crown group, indicating that some divergence among the extant skink subfamilies must have already occurred by 100 million years ago. Other definitive skink fossils are known from the Miocene.

Skink genera known from fossils include the following:


==Behavior==
A trait apparent in many species of skink is digging and burrowing. Many spend their time underground where they are mostly safe from predators, sometimes even digging out tunnels for easy navigation. They also use their tongues to sniff the air and track their prey. When they encounter their prey, they chase it down until they corner it or manage to land a bite and then swallow it whole. Despite being voracious hunters at times, all species pose no threat to humans and will generally avoid interaction in the wild. Being neither poisonous nor venomous, their bites are also mild and minor.

===Diet===
Skinks are generally carnivorous and in particular insectivorous. Typical prey include flies, crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, and caterpillars. Various species also eat earthworms, millipedes, centipedes, snails, slugs, isopods (woodlice etc), moths, small lizards (including geckos), and small rodents. Some species, particularly those favored as home pets, are omnivorous and have more varied diets and can be maintained on a regimen of roughly 60% vegetables/leaves/fruit and 40% meat (insects and rodents). Species of the genus &quot;Tristiidon&quot; are mainly frugivorous, but occasionally eat moss and insects.

===Breeding===

Although most species of skinks are oviparous, laying eggs in clutches, some 45% of skink species are viviparous in one sense or another. Many species are ovoviviparous, the young (skinklets) developing lecithotrophically in eggs that hatch inside the mother&#x27;s reproductive tract, and emerging as live births.
In some genera, however, such as &quot;Tiliqua&quot; and &quot;Corucia&quot;, the young developing in the reproductive tract derive their nourishment from a mammal-like placenta attached to the female – unambiguous examples of viviparous matrotrophy. Furthermore, an example recently described in &quot;Trachylepis ivensi&quot; is the most extreme to date: a purely reptilian placenta directly comparable in structure and function, to a eutherian placenta. 
Clearly, such vivipary repeatedly has developed independently in the evolutionary history of the Scincidae and the different examples are not ancestral to the others. In particular, placental development of whatever degree in lizards is phylogenetically analogous, rather than homologous, to functionally similar processes in mammals.
===Nesting===
Skinks typically seek out environments protected from the elements, such as thick foliage, underneath man-made structures, and ground-level buildings such as garages and first-floor apartments. When two or more skinks are seen in a small area, it is typical to find a nest nearby. Skinks are considered to be territorial and often are seen standing in front of or &quot;guarding&quot; their nest area. If a nest is nearby, one can expect to see 10-30 lizards within the period of a month. In parts of the southern United States, nests are commonly found in houses and apartments, especially along the coast. The nest is where the skink lays its small white eggs, up to 4-8 at a time.

==Habitat==

Skinks are very specific in their habitat as some can depend on vegetation while others may depend on land and the soil. As a family, skinks are cosmopolitan; species occur in a variety of habitats worldwide, apart from boreal and polar regions. Various species occur in ecosystems ranging from deserts and mountains to grasslands.

Many species are good burrowers. More species are terrestrial or fossorial (burrowing) than arboreal (tree-climbing) or aquatic species. Some are &quot;sand swimmers&quot;, especially the desert species, such as the mole skink or sand skink in Florida. Some use a very similar action in moving through grass tussocks. Most skinks are diurnal (day-active) and typically bask on rocks or logs during the day.

==Predators==
Raccoons, foxes, possums, snakes, coatis, weasels, crows, cats, dogs, herons, hawks, lizards, and other predators of small land vertebrates also prey on various skinks. This can be troublesome, given the long gestation period for some skinks, making them an easy target to predators such as the mongoose, which often threaten the species to at least near extinction, such as the Anguilla Bank skink. Invasive rodents are a major threat to skinks that have been overlooked, especially tropical skinks.

Skinks are also hunted for food by indigenous peoples in New Guinea, including by the Kalam people in the highlands of Madang Province, Papua New Guinea.

==Genetics==
===Genomic architecture===
Despite making up 15% of reptiles, skinks have a relatively conserved chromosome number, between 11 and 16 pairs. Skink genomes are typically about 1.5 Gb, approximately one-half the size of the human genome. The Christmas Island blue-tailed skink (&quot;Cryptoblepharus egeriae&quot;) was sequenced in 2022, representing the first skink reference genome. 

===Sex determination systems===
Skinks were long thought to have both genetic sex determination (GSD) and temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Despite having sex chromosomes that are not distinguishable with a microscope, all major skink lineages share an old XY system that is over 80 million years old. These X and Y specific regions are highly divergent and contain multiple chromosomal rearrangements and repetitive sequences.

==Genera==
Many genera, &quot;Mabuya&quot; for example, are still insufficiently studied, and their systematics are at times controversial, see for example the taxonomy of the western skink, &quot;Plestiodon skiltonianus&quot;. &quot;Mabuya&quot; in particular, is being split, many species being allocated to new genera such as &quot;Trachylepis&quot;, &quot;Chioninia&quot;, and &quot;Eutropis&quot;.

<text>The Bristol Type 175 Britannia is a retired British medium-to-long-range airliner built by the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1952 to meet British civilian aviation needs. During development two prototypes were lost and the turboprop engines proved susceptible to inlet icing, which delayed entry into service while solutions were sought.

By the time development was completed, &quot;pure&quot; jet airliners from France, the United Kingdom, and the United States were about to enter service, and consequently, only 85 Britannias were built before production ended in 1960. Nevertheless, the Britannia is considered one of the landmarks in turboprop-powered airliner design and was popular with passengers. It became known as &quot;The Whispering Giant&quot; for its quiet exterior noise and smooth flying, although the passenger interior remained less tranquil.

Canadair purchased a licence to build the Britannia in Canada, adding another 72 aircraft in two variants. These were the stretched Canadair CL-44/Canadair CC-106 Yukon, and the greatly modified Canadair CP-107 Argus maritime patrol aircraft.

==Design and development==
===Origins===
In 1942, during the Second World War, Allied aircraft construction saw the UK of necessity concentrating on heavy bombers, leaving the production of transport aircraft to the USA. This would have left the UK with little experience in transport construction at the end of the war, so in 1943, a committee under Lord Brabazon of Tara investigated the future British civilian airliner market. The Brabazon Committee called for several aircraft to be developed to its specifications for Britain&#x27;s civilian aviation needs.

Bristol won the Type I and Type III contracts, delivering their Type I design, the Bristol Brabazon in 1949. The requirement for the 1946 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Medium Range Empire (MRE) Requirements coincided with the Type III, Specification C.2/47, issued in April 1947 by the Minister of Supply. The specifications called for an airliner capable of carrying 48 passengers and powered with Bristol Centaurus radial engines or Napier Nomad turbo-compound Diesel engine. Turboprop options were also considered, but they were so new that Bristol could not guarantee their performance.

Although in-company Proposals &quot;X&quot; for conversions of Lockheed Constellations to Centaurus 662 powerplants or &quot;Y&quot; for licence production of the Constellation were considered in late 1946, BOAC decided that an entirely new design was preferred. After wrangling between the Ministry of Supply and BOAC over costs, the go-ahead for the project assigned the company designation Model 175 in July 1948. Three prototypes were ordered with the first being Mk 1 (Centaurus 662), and the second and third prototypes designated Mk 2 (to be convertible to Bristol Proteus turboprops, then under development).

In October 1947, with work already underway, Bristol had settled on a Centaurus-powered design with a gross weight of and a payload of . The anticipated Karachi-Cairo run necessitated a 48-seat limit including sufficient fuel for the lengthy stage. On 5 July 1949, the Ministry of Supply ordered five such prototypes with the understanding that BOAC would contract for 25 production units. BOAC purchased options for 25 aircraft on 28 July powered by the Bristol Centaurus, but to be re-fitted with the Bristol Proteus when available.

===Redefinition and prototypes===
In November 1948, the Type 175 was revised again to accommodate 74 passengers and a longer wingspan in a contemplated long-range version aimed at long-haul Empire and transatlantic routes rather than the medium-haul Empire routes originally planned. On reflection, BOAC decided that only the Proteus engine was viable, necessitating a further redesign eliminating the Centaurus option. Senior figures within BOAC such as the Deputy Chairman Whitney Straight, however, considered the Proteus engine to be &quot;an obsolete contraption&quot;. Despite BOAC&#x27;s desire to have a turboprop engine, the Type 175 project was contingent on the Proteus passing a 150-hour Type Test.

During April 1950, the airliner&#x27;s name, &quot;Britannia&quot;, was selected. The designation &quot;Britannia 101&quot; was applied to first pair of prototypes, which were powered by the early Proteus 625, the successor to the 600 series engine that had already completed type trials.

The first prototype, registered &quot;G-ALBO&quot;, with Bristol Chief Test Pilot A.J. &quot;Bill&quot; Pegg at the controls, first flew on 16 August 1952 at Filton Aerodrome. During the maiden flight, the over-sensitive flying controls led to wild pitching before Pegg restored control. During the landing approach, smoke filled the cockpit and the main undercarriage bogie temporarily stuck, only fully deploying seconds before landing. The snags were resolved and by September, the prototype was cleared to perform at the 1952 SBAC Display at Farnborough where spectators commented on the &quot;quietness&quot; of the giant airliner. In November 1952, Popular Science reported that by 1954 BOAC would have 25 of these aircraft on routes such as London-to-Tokyo over the Arctic and North Pole.

===Delays===
After three de Havilland Comets crashed without explanation in 1953 and 1954, the Air Ministry demanded that the Britannia undergo lengthy tests. Further delays were attributed to teething problems with the engine resulting in the loss in February 1954 of the second prototype, &quot;G-ALRX&quot;, caused by a failed reduction gear that led to an engine fire and the aircraft landing on the mudflats of the Severn Estuary. Finally, time was lost in resolving inlet icing issues (by selecting a different cruising height) that were discovered as the first aircraft were being delivered to BOAC. These were exaggerated by BOAC, devastated future sales and delayed the Britannia&#x27;s introduction by two years.
The first prototype &quot;G-ALBO&quot; was modified to more closely approximate a production standard, but was retained by the company to undergo engine testing and development. Bristol revised the design into a larger transatlantic airliner for BOAC, resulting in the Series 200 and 300; the Britannia 300LR (Long-Range) was viewed as being &quot;eminently suitable&quot; for BOAC&#x27;s services between London and Sydney. The purchase price for each Britannia 100-series aircraft was agreed by BOAC in 1955 at £768,000.

Australian airline Qantas considered the procurement of a Britannia fleet, however its protracted development eroded any competitive advantage against the Douglas DC-8 and de Havilland Comet 4. Route-proving trials continued through 1955, although orders were on the books from &quot;El Al&quot; and Canadian Pacific Air Lines alongside the standing order placed by BOAC.

During the first eight months of its operational trials, a total of 16 in-flight engine failures and 49 unscheduled engine changes punctuated the ongoing engine problem and delayed the Britannia&#x27;s in-service date until February 1957, roughly two years late. The Britannia received a fair amount of attention in both the popular press and the British House of Commons, especially when it was revealed that BOAC had contemplated fitting Rolls-Royce Tynes to their fleet of Douglas DC-7s as an interim measure until the Britannia was cleared for service.

In 1956, Bristol&#x27;s managing director Peter Masefield flew the tenth production Britannia, G-ANBJ, on a world sales tour. American interest was strong, since the Britannia seemed to be a faster, longer-range, higher-capacity sister of the Vickers Viscount, which was already a marketing success on US domestic routes, and, compared to the piston-engined DC-7C, itself a new type, the Britannia offered similar transcontinental or transatlantic range with greater speeds and the public appeal of more modern powerplants. Eastern Air Lines and TWA both wished to place orders, which might have forced competitors to follow suit. TWA&#x27;s majority owner Howard Hughes took the controls of the Britannia for one flight and immediately requested 30 aircraft. However, the Americans wanted delivery within a couple of years, and Bristol, with its limited production facilities and the prior commitment to the BOAC order, could not meet that requirement, so, with the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 jets expected in service by 1958-9, the opportunity passed.

Aviation historian Peter Pigott summarised the impact of the delays:
===Related developments===
In 1954, a licence was issued to Canadair to build the derivative Canadair CL-28/CP-107 Argus, and the Canadair CL-44/Canadair CC-106 Yukon. Based on the Britannia, the Argus maritime patrol and anti-submarine military aircraft was optimised for endurance on long-range patrol, not speed, and used four Wright R-3350-32W Turbo-Compound engines that used less fuel at low altitude. Unlike its Britannia forebear, the Argus was a hybrid, using the Britannia wings, tail surfaces and landing gear matched to a &quot;purpose-built&quot;, unpressurised fuselage. It substituted North American materials and standard parts for British parts.

The interior of the Argus was well equipped to conduct anti-submarine warfare — navigation, communication and tactical electronic equipment along with weapon loads that included bombs, torpedoes, mines and depth charges. A total of 33 Argus aircraft were built in two series (Mk 1 and Mk 2), serving the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and Canadian Forces from 1957 to 1982.

Canadair built 39 Canadair CL-44/Canadair CC-106 Yukon turboprop Rolls-Royce Tyne-powered aircraft, comprising 12 CC-106 Yukon for the RCAF and 27 CL-44D4 passenger/cargo variants for the civil market. Civilian operators typically operated the type as freighters. Four CL-44D4s were converted as CL-44Js with lengthened fuselages for service with the Icelandic &quot;budget&quot; airline &quot;Loftleiðir&quot;. The CL-44D4s were all built with swing-tails to allow straight-in cargo loading and served with a variety of carriers, most notably Flying Tiger Line. The similar CC-106 Yukon was used by the RCAF in a solely passenger configuration.

A final &quot;one-off&quot; development was the Conroy Skymonster, nicknamed &quot;Guppy&quot;, based on a Canadair CL-44D4 N447T. The prominent modification was an enlarged fuselage, like the Mini Guppy, which was produced by Jack Conroy&#x27;s previous company, Aero Spacelines. After a long operational career as a freighter, the &quot;Guppy&quot; was stored at Bournemouth Airport in 2003 and was later sold.

==Operational history==

Following a long period of uneventful development flying trials and the fitting of a modified Proteus 765 series engine that greatly reduced breakdowns, a full Certificate of Airworthiness was awarded at the end of 1955. The first two Model 102s were delivered to BOAC on 30 December 1955 for crew training. The Model 102 began scheduled service on 1 February 1957 with a BOAC flight from London to Johannesburg, flights to Sydney following in March and to Tokyo in July. By August 1957, the first 15 Model 102 aircraft had been delivered to BOAC. The last 10 aircraft of the order were built as Series 300 aircraft for transatlantic flights.

In April 1959, a Model 102 Britannia was leased by BOAC to Ghana Airways for flights between Accra and London, and several more Britannias were purchased by the airline in the early 1960s. The Model 102 was eventually made available to other BOAC associates, including Cathay Pacific, Central Africa, East African, Nigeria and Malayan airlines.
The next production series was based on the long-range, mixed passenger/freight Model 200 series that was intended for civil airline use, but ultimately Bristol offered the series to the Royal Air Force (RAF) instead. The production series of three Model 252 and 20 Model 253 aircraft were purchased by RAF Transport Command in 1959, assigned the designation &quot;Britannia C.2&quot; (first Model 252 series) and &quot;C.1&quot; (Model 253 series). Those in RAF service were allocated the names of stars, such as &quot;Arcturus&quot;, &quot;Sirius&quot; and &quot;Vega&quot;. On retirement from the RAF in 1975, many Model 200 series were subsequently used by independent civil operators for cargo operations, harkening back to their original intended role.

Although the Bristol Model 302 was built first as part of the original BOAC order, BOAC released this series to other airlines; &quot;Aeronaves de Mexico&quot; took two Model 302s, which entered service in December 1957. The 18 Bristol Britannia 312s for BOAC were delivered from September 1957 with its service introduction on the first-ever non-stop flight from London to Canada on 19 December 1957. In late December 1957, BOAC began regular Britannia flights from London to New York. Other airlines, such as Israel&#x27;s &quot;El Al&quot;, also operated the Britannia on transatlantic routes.

In 1959, BOAC started flying the Britannia across the Pacific to Tokyo and Hong Kong, thus extending their network round the world. The westbound routing in 1959 for these intercontinental BOAC Britannia flights between the U.K. and Asia was London-New York-San Francisco-Honolulu-Wake Island-Tokyo-Hong Kong.
On 1 April 1958 Canadian Pacific Air Lines took delivery of the first of six Model 314 Britannias, with an additional two Model 324s (built to a 320 standard) arriving later and sold to Cathay Pacific in 1961. BOAC ordered seven Model 302s, but never took delivery, instead they were taken on by airlines including &quot;Aeronaves de México&quot; and Ghana Airways. The main long-range series were the 310s, of which BOAC took 18 and, after deliveries began in September 1957, put them into service between London and New York City; in March 1964 BOAC owned 50 aircraft, 10 being Britannia 312s. BOAC&#x27;s last scheduled Britannia flight was April 1965.

The 310 series (the Model 318) also saw transatlantic service with &quot;Cubana de Aviación&quot; starting in 1958, in spite of the Cuban Revolution the airline had a special accord with British aircraft manufacturers to maintain this model of aircraft. In 1975, multiple Cuban Britannias were used to transport hundreds of soldiers of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces to Angola in Operation Carlota, a proxy war. &quot;Cubana de Aviación&quot; continued to fly its fleet of Britannias until March 1990.
Following the purchase of remaining spare parts from the Royal Aircraft Establishment and Cubana, Zaïrois airlines continued to operate several Britannias into the early 1990s on regular cargo flights from N&#x27;djili Airport to various destinations within the country.

Most aircraft were built by Bristol at Filton, but 30 were built at Belfast by Short Brothers and Harland. Due to the extended development instead of a projected production of 180 Britannias, only 80 were sold. The negative experience with the development of the Britannia caused BOAC to be more cautious towards other British-made aircraft such as the Vickers VC10. Throughout the Britannia&#x27;s lifespan, the engine icing condition remained a &quot;continual potential hazard&quot; that flight crews ultimately learned to manage with a &quot;high-lo&quot; flight regime that minimized the danger, Squadron Leader David Berry who had 5,000 hours on the type characterised it as flying &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot; &quot;Aeroplane&quot; in &quot;100 Great British Aircraft&quot; (2008) said the Britannia counted among the &quot;greats&quot;.

==Accidents and incidents==
Fourteen Britannias were lost with a total of 365 fatalities between 1954 and 1980. The worst accident was the 1967 Nicosia Britannia disaster with a loss of life totalling 126.
* On 4 February 1954, the second Britannia prototype was on a test flight when it crashed at Severn Beach, Gloucestershire. No. 3 engine indicated a loss of oil pressure so the crew shut it down. The crew restarted No. 3 but a fire broke out and could not be contained. No. 4 engine was then shut down as a precaution. On approach to Filton Airport, there was concern that the uncontrolled fire would lead to a failure of the main spar so the pilot, William &quot;Bill&quot; Pegg, elected to make an emergency landing on the mudflats of the Severn Estuary. There were no fatalities.
* On 6 November 1957, the 300 series prototype crashed during a test flight, killing the 15 occupants.
* On 24 December 1958, a BOAC Britannia 312 on a test flight crashed at Winkton, killing nine of the passengers and crew on board.
* On 5 July 1960, a Cuban Bristol Britannia 138 was hijacked by two co-pilots and diverted to Miami.
* On 22 July 1962, Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 301 a Britannia 314 was destroyed during an attempted &quot;go-around&quot; following a three-engined approach at Honolulu Airport, Hawaii.
* On 29 February 1964, British Eagle International Airlines Flight 802/6 crashed into the Glungezer mountain near Innsbruck killing all 83 people aboard.
* On 1 September 1966, Britannia Airways Flight 105 crashed while landing at Ljubljana, Slovenia (then Yugoslavia), resulting in a total of 98 fatalities out of 117 passengers and crew. The probable cause was the flight crew having failed to set their altimeter to QFE instead of QNH, creating a error in indicated altitude.

* On 20 April 1967, a Globe Air Britannia 313 was on a flight from Bangkok to Basel with intermediate stops at Colombo, Bombay (Mumbai) and Cairo. The crew did not fly to Cairo, but elected to fly to Nicosia instead, where a missed approach and subsequent low circuit ended in impact near the airport perimeter.
* On 12 October 1967, &quot;Sirius&quot; – a Royal Air Force C1 – was damaged beyond repair after over-running the runway at RAF Khormaksar, Aden.
* On 30 September 1977, an Interconair Britannia 253G was on a ferry flight. On approach to Shannon Airport severe vibration was experienced at a height of 300 feet. The approach was abandoned and an overshoot was commenced. The aircraft continued to sink and collided with the ground, short of, and to the right of, the runway. The aircraft bounced and the right wing broke off. The aircraft then skidded and caught fire. All six people on board survived.
* On 16 February 1980, a Britannia 253F of Redcoat Air Cargo crashed at Billerica, Massachusetts, shortly after taking off from Boston. The probable cause was an accumulation of ice and snow on the airframe before takeoff and a further accumulation of ice when it was then flown into moderate to severe icing conditions. Contributing to the cause were encounters with wind shear, downdrafts, and turbulence during the climb. Of eight crew and passengers, seven died and one was seriously injured.

<text>The British Independent Film Awards (BIFA) is an organisation that celebrates, supports, and promotes British independent cinema and film-making talent in the United Kingdom. Nominations for the annual awards ceremony are announced in early November, with the ceremony itself taking place in early December.

Since 2015, BIFA has also hosted UK-wide talent development and film screening programmes, with the support of Creative Skillset and the British Film Institute.

==History==
The British Independent Film Awards (BIFA) were created in 1998 by Elliot Grove and Suzanne Ballantyne of the Raindance Film Festival, with the aim of celebrating merit and achievement in independently funded British filmmaking, honouring new talent and promoting British films and filmmaking to a wider public audience. BIFA founding members include Phillip Alberstat, Chris Auty, André Burgess, Sally Caplan, Pippa Cross, Christopher Fowler, Lora Fox Gamble, Steven Gaydos, Norma Heyman, Emma E. Hickox, Fred Hogge, Robert Jones, Steve Kenis, Alberto Lopez, Ollie Madden, Hamish McAlpine, Neil McCartney, Saul Metzstein, Martin Myers, Sarah Radclyffe, Tracey Scoffield, Mark Shivas, Jim Wilson, and Michiyo Yoshizaki.

The first BIFA ceremony took place on 29 October 1998. Winners included Ken Loach (for &quot;My Name is Joe&quot;), Shane Meadows (for &quot;Twentyfour Seven&quot;) and Ray Winstone (for &quot;Nil by Mouth&quot;). The Special Jury Prize was awarded to Nik Powell, and the Best British Independent Film award went to &quot;My Name is Joe&quot;.

==Ceremony==
The BIFA ceremony takes place in early December every year and is one of the first dates in the annual awards season. Most of the awards categories are for British independent feature films only, though there are awards for Best International Independent Film and Best British Short Film. There are also several honorary awards, such as the Special Jury Prize, the Richard Harris Award and the Variety Award. Awarded since 2013, the trophy has been a sculpture by Fredrikson Stallard for Swarovski.

==Entry criteria==
BIFA entries close in late August / early September.

Main categories (British feature films):
* Films must be over 70 minutes in length.
* Films must have had a public screening to a paying audience, either on general release in the UK or at a British film festival or at one of BIFA&#x27;s recognised international festivals.
* Must be produced or majority co-produced by a British production company, or be in receipt of at least 51% of its budget from British source(s) and have sufficient British creative elements (e.g. Director, Writer, Producer, other cast &amp; crew).
* Where there is a major studio substantially funding a film, the total budget must not exceed $20 million.

Best International Independent Film:
* Films must have had a theatrical release in the UK within BIFA&#x27;s eligibility dates for the given year, or have won an award at one of BIFA&#x27;s recognised international film festivals.

==Voting process==
BIFA has a large pool of voters that consists of past BIFA winners and nominees, top British film industry professionals and experienced filmmakers from all areas of production. Although the pool is continually growing, fewer than 200 voters vote for the nominations in any one year.

All entered films must be seen by a minimum number of voters and discussed at a voter meeting before being marked as having been given fair consideration. Once all entered films have been given fair consideration, votes are cast privately in two rounds: once to reduce all entries to long lists of around 15 films in each category, and again to reduce the long lists to the 5 final nominees. In calculating the results, BIFA takes into account the number of voters who have seen each film as well as how many voted for it.

The winners in most categories are decided by independent juries, newly–appointed each year. Juries meet to discuss all nominations before voting confidentially for the winner. Exceptions include the honorary awards and the award for Best British Independent Film, the winner of which is decided by a confidential vote amongst all BIFA voters.

==Year-round activity==
Since 2015, BIFA has also hosted UK–wide talent development and film screening programmes with the support of Creative Skillset and the BFI.

==BIFA Insider==
Running from September 2015 to June 2016, BIFA Insider gave UK–based university and film school students the chance to watch award-winning British films for free online and participate in live-streamed Q&amp;As with top craftspeople who worked on those films.

Sessions included &quot;The Lobster&quot; with production designer Jaqueline Abrahams, &quot;The Selfish Giant&quot; with casting director Amy Hubbard and &quot;Frank&quot; with composer Stephen Rennicks.

==BIFA Presents==
BIFA Presents is an ongoing project wherein BIFA supports the theatrical distribution of award-nominated and -winning films with special preview and event screenings. In February 2017, BIFA Presents hosted exclusive previews of the Oscar-winning &quot;Moonlight&quot; in conjunction with Everyman Cinemas.

==BIFA Independents==
BIFA Independents is a series of regular screenings of films featuring BIFA-winning and nominated talent. Supported by the BFI, Odeon Cinemas, Vue Cinemas and Everyman Cinemas, the screenings take place in 20 UK locations and aim to increase the number of people who watch British independent films at the cinema.

The first BIFA Independents screening was in December 2016, featuring Andrea Arnold&#x27;s Best British Independent Film-winning &quot;American Honey&quot;.

The specific name, &quot;lutzae&quot;, is in honor of Brazilian herpetologist Bertha Lutz. The original generic name, &quot;Bogertia&quot;, was in honor of American herpetologist Charles Mitchill Bogert.

==Geographic range==
&quot;P. lutzae&quot; is found in northeastern Brazil, in the Brazilian states of Bahia, Paraíba, and Pernambuco.

==Habitat==
The preferred natural habitat of &quot;P. lutzae&quot; is forest.

==Behavior==
&quot;P. lutzae&quot; is terrestrial, and it is both diurnal and nocturnal.

==Defensive behavior==
If threatened, &quot;P. lutzae&quot; may vocalize, and it may shed its tail (autotomy).

==Diet==
&quot;P. lutzae&quot; preys upon arthropods, mainly spiders and beetles. Its diet varies ontogenetically and seasonally.

==Reproduction==
&quot;P. lutzae&quot; is oviparous.

==Taxonomy==
Based on DNA analysis, Gamble et al. (2012) placed this species in the genus &quot;Phyllopezus&quot;, along with three other described species and several undescribed species.

<text>Calodactylodes is a genus of lizards, commonly called golden geckos, in the family Gekkonidae (geckos). The genus is distributed in peninsular India and Sri Lanka. Lizards in the genus &quot;Calodactylodes&quot; are primarily distinguished from other lizards by their characteristic, paired flower petal-like skin extensions on their fingers and toes.

==Taxonomy==
The generic name, &quot;Calodactylodes&quot;, created in 1928 by Embrik Strand, is a replacement name for Beddome&#x27;s &quot;Calodactylus&quot;. Replacement was necessary because when Richard Henry Beddome created &quot;Calodactylus&quot; in 1870, this name was already preoccupied by a genus of beetles which Émile Blanchard had named &quot;Calodactylus&quot; in 1850.

==Species==
The following two species are recognized as being valid.

*&quot;Calodactylodes aureus&quot; – Indian golden gecko 
*&quot;Calodactylodes illingworthorum&quot; – Sri Lankan golden gecko

==Geographic range==
The Indian species, &quot;C. aureus&quot;, is found in the Eastern Ghats hill range in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu states. The Sri Lankan species, &quot;C. illingworthorum&quot;, is found in the Eastern Province, Sri Lanka.

==Natural history==
Both species of &quot;Calodactylodes&quot; live in rock crevices, are nocturnal, insectivorous, and very social, living in colonies of multiple individuals. During breeding seasons, the dominant male acquires a brilliant golden yellow colour all over the body, and hence the common name. Females and young ones are drab brown, camouflaging among the rocks. These geckos are very vocal, and their loud rattling calls are often to be heard inside the dark ravines. They reproduce by laying eggs. Females are communal nesters and many may lay their eggs (often numbering in thousands) together simultaneously in a safe and suitable rock crevice, away from predators&#x27; reach.

<text>Christinus is a genus of Gekkonidae geckos found in southern regions of Australia. It contains species and subspecies that are regionally termed as marbled geckos. The contrasted patterns of these geckos, marbling, are found in a variety of reddish-brown, grey, silver, white, black and purplish hues. They are frequently found in old knotted trees and sometimes congregate in large numbers in established urban environments.

The genus was named for Christine Biggs, a friend of one of the authors.

==Classification==
&quot;Christinus&quot; was first described by Wells and Wellington in 1984, giving the types species as that published as &quot;Diplodactylus marmoratus&quot; Gray 1845. Their later proposal to establish a genus &quot;Ridegekko&quot;, based on Boulenger&#x27;s original description of &quot;Phyllodactylus guentheri&quot; (&quot;C. guentheri&quot;), is not given in later literature. 
The genus has been described as containing two species, the island population and the widespread southern population. The latter, &quot;C. marmoratus&quot;, has two or more subspecies in its distribution range. One proposed subspecies, &quot;Christinus marmoratus alexanderi&quot; Storr, has been elevated by some authorities to the rank of species.

==Species==
* &quot;C. alexanderi&quot; (endemic to Nullarbor Plain)
* &quot;C. guentheri&quot;, (Lord Howe and Norfolk Island)
* &quot;C. marmoratus&quot;, (widespread: southern mainland, northwest interior, islands)
**&quot;C. m. macrodactylus&quot;

<text>Canadair Ltd. was a Canadian civil and military aircraft manufacturer that operated from 1944 to 1986. In 1986, its assets were acquired by Bombardier Aerospace, the aviation division of Canadian transport conglomerate Bombardier Inc.

Canadair&#x27;s origins lie in the establishment of a factory for Canadian Vickers in the Saint-Laurent borough of Montreal, at Cartierville Airport. It was created as a separate entity by the government of Canada on 11 November, 1944. 

Throughout much of its existence, it was a subsidiary of various other aircraft manufacturers prior to being nationalized by the Canadian government in 1976. 
For a decade, the company operated as a federally-owned Crown Corporation. In 1986, Canadair was privatized via its sale to Bombardier, after which it became a core element of the firm&#x27;s aerospace division. The company&#x27;s former principal manufacturing facility, &quot;Canadair Plant One&quot;, remains intact, although Cartierville Airport itself has been closed and since undergone redevelopment.

During its operational years, Canadair achieved several aviation firsts; the CL-44D, based on the British Bristol Britannia airliner, was the first design that allowed access by swinging the entire rear fuselage. The CL-89 and CL-289 were the first surveillance drones to be put into service in several countries&#x27; armed forces. The experimental CL-84 was the first VTOL aircraft that rotated the wings to achieve vertical lift-off (tiltwing). The CL-215 was the first purpose-designed water bomber.

==History==
Canadair was formally created on 11 November 1944 as a separate entity by the government of Canada. Having absorbed the operations of the Canadian Vickers company, it initially operated as a manufacturer of Consolidated PBY &quot;Canso&quot; flying boats on behalf of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Benjamin W. Franklin became its first president. In addition to the PBY contract, a development contract to produce a new variant of the Douglas DC-4 transport was also underway. The resulting aircraft, the Canadair DC-4M, which was powered by an arrangement of four British-sourced Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, began production during 1946; it was marketed under the &quot;Northstar&quot; name.

During the immediate postwar era, Canadair purchased the &quot;work in progress&quot; on the existing Douglas DC-3/C-47 series. In 1946, the Electric Boat Company, an American industrial group, bought a controlling interest in the company; shortly thereafter, the two companies merged to form the American company General Dynamics in 1952. During 1954, General Dynamics opted to purchase Convair, which had been created by the merger of Consolidated Aircraft and Vultee Aircraft; as a result of this purchase, Canadair was reorganised as Convair&#x27;s Canadian subsidiary.

During the 1950s, Canadair decided that it would develop its own indigenous trainer aircraft as a private venture. This aircraft, which would become the CT-114 Tutor was the product of the company’s in-house Preliminary Design department. By August 1957, the basic configuration had been completed, which was of a turbojet-powered, low-wing aircraft, complete with a tricycle undercarriage and a side-by-side cockpit arrangement. Despite a lack of official backing from the Canadian Government, the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s (RCAF) Directorate of Training’s Jet Trainer Liaison Committee had closely engaged with the company; their involvement in the project had reportedly made a significant impact in the aircraft&#x27;s final design. During September 1961, the Canadian government, having been impressed by the performance of the prototype, placed a sizeable order for 190 production aircraft on behalf of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Serving as the service&#x27;s primary trainer platform, the Tutor would be operated as such for over thirty years.

Another indigenously-developed design was the CL-215 amphibian. It arose from an internal research study during the early 1960s at Canadair, originally conceived of as a twin-engined floatplane transport based on the design of the &quot;369 Canso&quot; (a variant of the PBY). However, it was altered into a &quot;firefighter&quot; following a request by forestry officials in the Quebec Service Aérien (Quebec Government Air Service) who wanted a more effective way of delivering water to forest fires. The 1962 preliminary design, designated as the &quot;CL-204&quot;, was a purpose-designed water bomber that evolved into an amphibian flying boat configuration, powered by two shoulder-mounted Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 piston engines. Its design was shaped by a desire for the CL-205 to be well-suited for performing a range of roles, including air-sea search and rescue, cargo haulage and commercial passenger-carrying, in addition to the water bomber mission. The definitive design was publicly revealed at the 1965 Paris Air Show. While the &quot;CL-215A&quot; served as the standard water bomber configuration, another model, designated as the &quot;CL-215C&quot;, had been envisioned to dispense with compromises meant to enhance its performance at the water bomber role, allowing it be furnished with larger doors on the sides of the fuselage and a revised underfloor hull structure.

Perhaps the company&#x27;s most commercially successful product was the Challenger 600 business jet. Originally conceived of by the American aviation inventor Bill Lear as the &quot;LearStar 600&quot;, at the end of 1975, Canadair gave its backing to the concept; during April 1976, the company opted to acquire the whole project, formally launching it with the backing of the Canadian federal government shortly thereafter. Development of the Challenger 600 was hampered by a deadly crash amid the flight test programme on 3 April 1980; despite this, type certification for the aircraft was approved by both Transport Canada and the Federal Aviation Administration later that same year. The high cost of developing the Challenger 600 has been attributed as a major cause of Canadair&#x27;s poor financial situation during the 1980s, being reportedly close to bankruptcy; the company&#x27;s condition in turn ultimately contributed to its acquisition by Bombardier Inc. during 1986. In the long run, the business jet was well received by the market and can be considered to be a success, being produced for over four decades. In excess of 1,000 Challenger 600s had been reportedly completed by late 2018.
Outside of the field of aviation, Canadair opted to diversify into various other sectors, developing its own range of industrial and commercial products. The &quot;Canarch&quot; division was involved in curtain wall design and manufacture for a number of buildings. They also produce the cabins for many air traffic control towers operated by the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States. Both tracked and air-cushioned vehicles were designed and underwent testing; however none proceeded into commercial production.

In the late 1950s, the United States Army contracted Canadair to develop a small light-weight all-terrain amphibious tracked vehicle. In turn, Canadair developed the CL-70 RAT &quot;Remote Articulated Track&quot;; this vehicle, while not a commercial success, gave Canadair useful experience towards the development of the upgraded CL-91 Dynatrac, which was a marketing success and purchased by the US Army as &quot;XM-571&quot;.

During 1976, the Canadian government nationalized Canadair Ltd., by completing the purchase of the corporate assets from General Dynamics. It remained a federal crown corporation until 1986 when, having experienced record losses during its development of the Challenger business jet, the Mulroney government sold it to Bombardier Inc. Shortly after Canadair&#x27;s acquisition, Bombardier was able to restore it to profitability; the company soon acquired other aviation companies, such as the near-bankrupt Short Brothers of Belfast, Northern Ireland, and the business jet specialist Learjet of Wichita, Kansas, as well as de Havilland Aircraft of Canada of Toronto, Ontario. Together with these other entities, Canadair became a core component of Bombardier Aerospace.

Following the company&#x27;s acquisition by Bombardier, the Canadair name had continued to be prominently used in the branding of its larger series of business jets and regional jets, which have been marketed as the Canadian Regional Jet (CRJ). However, this branding has since been dropped; new projects from all of Bombardier&#x27;s various aircraft divisions have since simply been known as Bombardier Aerospace.

<text>Gustafs skål (), is a song written by Carl Michael Bellman as a salutation to Gustav III of Sweden, following the coup d&#x27;état of 1772, which made himself an autocrat and ended the parliamentary age of liberty. The king very much liked the song and informally it came to function as his royal anthem.

<text>The War of Devolution took place from May 1667 to May 1668. In the course of the war, France occupied large parts of the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comté, both then provinces of the Holy Roman Empire ruled by Spain. Its name derives from an obscure law known as the &quot;Jus Devolutionis&quot;, used by Louis XIV to claim that these territories had &quot;devolved&quot; to him by right of marriage to Maria Theresa of Spain.

The French encountered minimal resistance, but Louis returned much of their gains in the May 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. The terms were agreed by Emperor Leopold I in January 1668, reinforced by the Triple Alliance of England, Sweden and the Dutch Republic. 

The French invasion of the Spanish Netherlands marked the end of the long-standing Franco-Dutch alliance, and was the first of Louis XIV&#x27;s wars of expansion that dominated Western Europe for the last decades of the 17th century.

==Background==
As part of the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees that ended the Franco-Spanish War, Louis XIV of France married Maria Theresa, eldest daughter of Philip IV of Spain. Despite being weakened by almost a century of continuous warfare, the Spanish Empire included possessions in Italy, the Spanish Netherlands, the Philippines and the Americas, and though no longer the dominant great power, remained largely intact. To prevent its acquisition by France, Maria Theresa renounced her inheritance rights; in return, Louis was promised a dowry of 500,000 gold écus, a huge sum that was never paid.

When Cardinal Mazarin died in 1661, Louis took control of the state and initiated an expansionist policy. His Finance Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert argued control of the Spanish Netherlands was essential to French economic growth, which implied conflict with Spain, Emperor Leopold I and the Dutch Republic, a long-term French ally. The 1648 Peace of Münster confirmed Dutch independence and gave Amsterdam control of trade through North-West Europe, by permanently closing the Scheldt estuary. Retaining this monopoly was a Dutch priority.

By 1663, Louis concluded that the States General of the Netherlands would never voluntarily agree to his demands and began plans to seize the Spanish Netherlands, although negotiations continued to avoid raising suspicions. As required by the 1662 Franco-Dutch Treaty of Paris, France entered the Second Anglo-Dutch War in July 1665, providing an excuse for its military build up; Louis also calculated that this would make it harder for the Dutch to oppose him. Philip&#x27;s death in September left his four-year-old son Charles as king, and his widow Mariana of Austria as regent. If Charles died, Leopold would inherit the Spanish Empire.

French lawyers argued that as the dowry remained unpaid, Maria Theresa&#x27;s renunciation was invalid, and her rights &quot;devolved&quot; to Louis under the &quot;Jus Devolutionis&quot;, an obscure law restricting inheritance to children from a first marriage. On this basis, he claimed most of the Spanish Netherlands, including Brabant and Limburg, the towns of Cambrai, Antwerp and Mechelen, Upper Guelders, the counties of Namur, Artois and Hainaut, and related possessions. Leopold and Mariana dismissed this claim, as the law applied only in Brabant, Namur and Hainault and concerned private property, not feudal rights; however, this gave Louis a legal justification for his actions.

Aware of French intentions, Mariana&#x27;s government sought to end the Portuguese Restoration War, agree to an alliance with England, and break the Franco-Dutch relationship. Louis countered with the 1667 Treaty of Lisbon, a ten-year alliance with Portugal, and paid potential opponents like Brandenburg to remain neutral. Leopold was occupied with the Great Turkish War, while Foreign Minister Hugues de Lionne also extended the anti-Austrian League of the Rhine until 1668.

On 8 May, every French ambassador in Europe read out a declaration, claiming Louis was taking possession of lands that rightfully belonged to him. In mid-May, talks to end the Anglo-Dutch War opened in Breda between the Dutch Republic, Denmark–Norway, France and England; shortly before, Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt of the Dutch Republic learned Louis and Charles II of England had secretly agreed to terms in advance, increasing the pressure on the Dutch not to oppose French aims.

The impending war ended Spain&#x27;s reluctance to accept Portuguese sovereignty; the Anglo-Spanish Treaty of Madrid, signed on 23 May, granted England substantial commercial privileges, in return for help in ending the war with Portugal.

The Spanish Netherlands was a compact area, dominated by canals and rivers. Until the advent of railways in the 19th century, goods and supplies were largely transported by water; campaigns in this theatre focused on control of strongpoints along rivers such as the Lys, Sambre and Meuse.

After 1659, a series of military reforms initiated by Michel Le Tellier made the French army more professional, while improving its logistic support. This allowed them to put larger numbers in the field, for longer periods; by 1667, the army had an authorised strength of 80,000, of whom 51,000 were deployed for the campaign.

Turenne was appointed supreme commander; his main force of 35,000 men and the artillery train were concentrated around Mézières, on the River Meuse. Another 9,000 under Antoine d&#x27;Aumont prepared to advance up the Lys, via Kortrijk and Oudenaarde; de Créquy and 6,000 light cavalry were based at Sierck-les-Bains, securing their flank against an attack from Germany. Accompanied by Louis and his entourage, the French crossed the border on 24 May.

Aware of these preparations, Spanish governor Castelo Rodrigo urgently requested additional funds from Madrid. Despite spending the enormous sum of 1.5 million escudos on her daughter&#x27;s wedding, Mariana managed to increase the forces available to him from 11,000 in mid 1666 to 27,000 by April 1667.

Although insufficient to defend every position, the Spanish did not need to do so. Given time, it was accepted even the strongest fortifications would fall and their primary purpose was to delay, while the defenders mobilised reserves or found a diplomatic solution. Capturing towns was relatively easy, holding them far harder, since every garrison weakened the field army; over the next century, the French confronted this strategic dilemma time and again in this theatre.

Turenne&#x27;s first objective was Charleroi, a key Spanish supply base; Castelo Rodrigo could not hold it and withdrew to Brussels, first destroying its fortifications. On 2 June, De Montal was appointed French governor and given a garrison of 3,000, while Vauban began rebuilding its defences. By the end of July, Rochebaron had captured Tournai, Kortrijk and Oudenaarde; Turenne advanced on Dendermonde, intending to take Antwerp.

On 31 July, peace treaties were signed at Breda (between England and each of its opponents in the Second Anglo-Dutch War) and the Dutch began discussions with England and Spain on creating a diplomatic alliance against France. At the same time, Castelo Rodrigo opened the water defences, flooding the land and bringing the French advance to a halt. Turenne withdrew and on 10 August besieged Lille, capital of the Walloon region and an important commercial centre.

The garrison were allowed to withdraw after surrendering on 28 August; three days later, de Marchin and a Spanish relief force of 12,000 ran into a French cavalry detachment on the Bruges road. Ordered to cut off his retreat, Bellefonds and de Créquy inflicted nearly 2,000 casualties; in early 1668, Louis created both Marshals of France. On 12 September, Turenne captured Aalst but although his troops suffered relatively few battle casualties, sickness was a far bigger problem; in early October, campaigning ended for the winter.

===Negotiations; winter 1667/1668===

On 31 July 1667, the Treaty of Breda ended the Anglo-Dutch War and negotiations began on a common front against France. This was driven by the States of Zeeland, supported by Sir William Temple, English ambassador in the Hague and Brussels, and Francois-Paul de Lisola, Leopold&#x27;s representative in London.

De Witt summarised the Dutch dilemma as follows; &#x27;to abandon Spain is to make France a present of the Netherlands, to take on her defence alone is folly.&#x27; Although he and Charles of England preferred France, the vast majority of their countrymen did not, which meant they had to satisfy domestic opinion by making Louis retreat, but remain friends. According to the French ambassador in Sweden, Charles quickly recognised this was almost impossible, and focused on ensuring Louis blamed De Witt.

From April 1667 to June 1668, Franco-Dutch trade declined by 30%, due to the imposition of French tariffs. Combined with the prospect of France as a neighbour, this led to widespread support for an Anglo-Dutch alliance among Orangists, the States General and the general populace. In England, Parliament and business wanted peace, while most preferred Spain for strategic and commercial reasons, including chief minister Lord Arlington; an Anglo-Dutch alliance in support of Spain seemed the ideal solution. Finally, it allowed Charles of England to keep Parliament happy, while demonstrating Dutch unreliability and thus increasing the price Louis would pay for his support in the 1670 Treaty of Dover.

In September, De Witt promised to ensure Spain accepted French terms for ending the war, but Louis insisted he commit to enforcing them if needed. When Mariana refused, he persuaded the States of Holland to pass resolutions on 10 December and 14 January 1668, approving military action against Spain. This was strongly resisted by the other provinces, and the Orangist opposition in Holland.

When Philip died in 1665, Spain&#x27;s only ally was Leopold; by 1668, their diplomats had built relationships with the Orangists, England, and traditional French supporters like Sweden and Brandenburg. In September 1667, Afonso VI of Portugal was deposed by his brother Pedro, who opened discussions on ending the Restoration war. The 1667 agreement with France was annulled and on 13 February 1668, Spain recognised Portuguese independence with the Treaty of Lisbon.

To fund the 1668 campaign, Castelo Rodrigo agreed to a loan of 2 million guilders from the Amsterdam financial markets; as security, the Dutch would be allowed to occupy Bruges, Ostend and Damme. The prospect of peace with Portugal meant Mariana could reject these conditions; she sent Castelo Rodrigo letters of credit for 600,000 escudos and one million bars of silver. This allowed him to begin recruiting, while Brandenburg agreed to supply 12,000 troops.

On 20 January, Louis and Leopold signed a Partition Treaty, agreeing to the division of the Spanish Empire if Charles of Spain died; this included the terms given to De Witt in September. The Triple Alliance was signed by England and the Dutch Republic on 23 January, the third member, Sweden, formally joining on 5 May, three days after Aix-la-Chapelle. It contained a pact of mutual defence, an agreement to ensure Spain accepted French terms, and secret clauses, including military action against France if Louis reneged on this promise.

Ruvigny, French ambassador in London, received a copy within days, allegedly from Arlington, which he passed onto Lionne. Writing ten years later, largely to justify the subsequent Franco-Dutch War, Louis claimed it was a calculated insult by the &#x27;ungrateful Dutch nation&#x27;, but his reaction at the time was far more moderate. The French recognised the military clause was largely unenforceable; as Turenne observed, &#x27;the Dutch have more ill-will than power, the English neither troops or money&#x27;. Lionne also pointed out the Alliance&#x27;s guarantee applied to both sides, obliging Spain to comply with French terms &#x27;without it costing us a sou.&#x27;

===February 1668; the campaign in Franche-Comté===

Throughout his career, Louis sought to improve his position prior to negotiations; in September, he decided to occupy Franche-Comté. It was almost impossible for Spain to defend, while its governor, the Marquis de Yenne, had fewer than 2,000 men to hold the entire province. French armies also benefitted from vastly superior logistics, allowing them to open campaigns before their opponents were ready. The invasion was planned for early February, normally considered impractical for troop movements, adding the factor of surprise to superior numbers.

The operation was commanded by the Prince de Condé. Once France&#x27;s leading general, he fought against Louis during the 1648 to 1653 Fronde, then with Spain until 1659; this was his first command since returning from exile in 1660. Franche-Comté was considered part of Burgundy, his family&#x27;s traditional power base and his selection demonstrated royal control over an area with a long history as an independent state.

To keep his opponents guessing, Louis announced plans to double the army to 134,000 and leaked details of a proposed 1668 campaign. Led by himself and Turenne, 66,000 men would complete the conquest of the Spanish Netherlands; a subsidiary force under Philippe of Orléans would attack Catalonia, with Condé in the Three Bishoprics to deter an attack from Germany.

This provided cover for assembling troops and supplies in Dijon; by early February, Condé had 12,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry concentrated near Auxonne. He divided the army into two columns, the other led by Luxembourg, and entered Franche-Comté on 4 February. Besançon and Salins-les-Bains surrendered on 7 February, after which Condé and Luxembourg moved onto Dole, where they were joined by Louis on 9 February. His presence resulted in a largely unnecessary assault, which cost the French between 400 and 500 casualties, their only significant losses of the campaign. Dole surrendered on 14 February, followed by the provincial capital of Gray on 19th; Louis was back in Saint-Germain on 24th.

===May 1668; Northern Catalonia===
On the southern front, the Spanish took the initiative; the Duke of Osuna, Viceroy of Catalonia, invaded the Upper Cerdanya with 2,300 infantry and 200 cavalry. Weak French defences allowed him to capture 55 villages in the region, although irregular local &quot;miquelets&quot; combined with the French military in resisting the invasion. Spanish incursions continued until 1669, forcing the French to fortify the border.

===Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle===
With the largest army in Europe, Turenne, Condé and Orléans argued for continuing the war. Lionne, Colbert and Le Tellier recommended peace, primarily on financial grounds; the 1660s was a period of significant economic decline, and war was expensive. France was unprepared for a naval war against the Dutch and English, and while Colbert had initiated policies aimed at reducing its dependence on Dutch shipping for transporting goods, this would take time. In addition to those already contracted with Brandenburg, Charles of Lorraine offered Mariana another 8,000 men. 

In February, seven year old Charles was reported to be suffering from smallpox, an often fatal disease; his death would give Louis a good chance of achieving his objectives without fighting. The combination decided him on peace; on 25 April, the Treaty of Saint Germain, between France, England and the Republic, finalised terms, which were then incorporated into the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, signed by Spain and France on 2 May.

==Aftermath==

France withdrew from Franche-Comté and the Spanish Netherlands, with the exception of eleven towns and their surrounding areas. Lille, Armentières, Bergues and Douai were considered essential to reinforce France&#x27;s vulnerable northern border and remain French to this day. The retention of Tournai, Oudenaarde, Kortrijk, Veurne, Binche, Charleroi and Ath made future offensives much easier, as demonstrated in 1672.

From a military perspective, France strengthened its northern border, and Vauban began work on the defence line that became known as the &quot;Ceinture de fer&quot;. Possession of towns like Charleroi and Tournai facilitated future campaigns through the control of vital routes into the Spanish Netherlands, but they were easily isolated and required expensive garrisons.

The political results were mixed; in the Partition Treaty, Leopold recognised Louis&#x27; right to inherit part of the Spanish Empire, much to the anger of Spain. However, Louis&#x27; expansionist ambitions sparked discussions on an anti-French coalition, culminating in the formation of the 1689 Grand Alliance.

The role of the Triple Alliance in the peace is debated by modern historians, including Herbert Rowen, &quot;arguably the most important English-speaking historian of the Dutch Republic since John Lothrop Motley&quot;. Its real significance was aligning English and Dutch objectives, despite the brief interruption in 1672 of the deeply unpopular Third Anglo-Dutch War; the Dutch viewed Aix-la-Chapelle as a diplomatic triumph.

Concern over French ambitions also revived the Orangist party, increasing internal political conflict with De Witt&#x27;s Republican faction. One result was the deliberate neglect of the Dutch army, generally seen as bolstering the power of the Prince of Orange; this had catastrophic repercussions in 1672. Louis went to war in 1667 believing the Dutch would never voluntarily agree to the concessions he required in the Spanish Netherlands; he now decided the best way to achieve this was to first defeat the Republic, and began planning the Franco-Dutch War.

<text>The southern flounders or armless flounders are a small family, Achiropsettidae, of flounders found in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters. There are four genera, each with one species.

The bodies of southern flounders are greatly compressed, with both eyes on the left side of their heads. The caudal fin is separate, and the pectoral fins are rudimentary or entirely absent; none of the fins has spines. The lateral line is straight and well-developed. The family varies considerably in size, from of &quot;Pseudomancopsetta andriashevi&quot; to the length of &quot;Neoachiropsetta milfordi&quot;.

Little is known of the habits of the species in this family.

<text>Cnemaspis is a genus of diurnal (day) geckos found in Asia. With over 100 species, it is one of the most diverse genera of geckos. Molecular phylogenies suggest that the two regional groupings may form distinct clades which are not each other&#x27;s closest relatives.

==Description==
Species in this genus have slender, clawed digits which are cylindrical or depressed at the base (rarely dilated); the distal phalanges are compressed, forming an angle with the basal portion of the digits, the lower surface of which has a row of plates. Their bodies are more or less depressed, granular or tubercular above. Tail not compressed. Pupil circular; eyelid distinct all round the eye. Males with or without pre-anal or femoral pores.

<text>The Theseus was the Bristol Aeroplane Company&#x27;s first attempt at a gas-turbine engine design. A turboprop delivering just over 2,000 hp (1,500 kW) was chosen rather than compete with companies that were already developing turbojets. A heat exchanger to transfer waste heat from the exhaust to the compressor exit was necessary to meet a requirement for a fuel consumption comparable to a piston engine. 
However, the heat exchanger was abandoned after tests showed that it had a high pressure loss and only produced a fuel saving of 8%. Furthermore overall performance was reduced 

As well as being one of the first engines to feature a free propeller turbine, the Theseus was the first turboprop in the world to pass a type test in January 1947. Following 156 hours of ground runs and the receipt of a test certificate from the Ministry of Supply on 28 January 1947, two Theseus engines were fitted in the outer positions of a four-engined Avro Lincoln for air tests. After ground and taxying test the Lincoln first flew on 17 February 1947.

The engine was also installed in two Handley Page Hermes 5 development aircraft.

It was soon superseded by the Proteus design with more power.

==Applications==

<text>William Parry Murphy Sr. (February 6, 1892 – October 9, 1987) was an American physician who shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1934 with George Richards Minot and George Hoyt Whipple for their combined work in devising and treating macrocytic anemia (specifically, pernicious anemia).

==Early life==
Murphy was born on February 6, 1892, at Stoughton, Wisconsin and moved to Condon, Oregon as a youth. His father, Thomas Francis Murphy, was a congregational minister of English and Irish heritage. His mother, Rosa Anna Parry, was of a Welsh landowning background. Murphy was educated at the public schools of Wisconsin and Oregon. He completed his A.B. degree in 1914 from the University of Oregon. He completed his M.D. in 1922 from Harvard Medical School.

==Career==

In 1924, Murphy bled dogs to make them anemic (work inspired by war injury work), and then fed them various substances to gauge their improvement. He discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to restore anemia more quickly of all foods. Minot and Whipple then set about to chemically isolate the curative substance. These investigations showed that iron in the liver was responsible for curing anemia from bleeding, but meanwhile liver had been tried on people with pernicious anemia and some effect was seen there, also. The active ingredient in this case, found serendipitously, was not iron, but rather a water-soluble extract containing a new substance. From this extract, chemists were ultimately able to isolate vitamin B12 from the liver. Even before the vitamin had been completely characterized, the knowledge that raw liver and its extracts treated pernicious anemia (previously a terminal disease) was a major advance in medicine. Minot and Murphy&#x27;s famous paper &quot;Treatment of pernicious anemia by a special diet&quot; was published in 1926.

In 1930, Murphy was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh with George Minot.

In 1951, Murphy was one of seven Nobel Laureates who attended the 1st Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting.

==Personal life==
Murphy married Pearl Harriett Adams (died 1980) on September 10, 1919. They had a son, William P. Murphy Jr., and a daughter, Priscilla Adams.

Murphy died on October 9, 1987 in Brookline, Massachusetts at the age of 95.

<text>Crossobamon is a genus of lizards of the gecko family Gekkonidae.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Crossobamon&quot; contains two species:

*&quot;Crossobamon eversmanni&quot; 
*&quot;Crossobamon orientalis&quot; 

The latter species is poorly described, and was formerly considered a member of the genus &quot;Stenodactylus&quot;.

==Etymology==
The genus name: Gr. κροσσοι &quot;krossoi&quot; &quot;tassels, fringe&quot;; βαινω &quot;bainō&quot; &quot;to walk&quot;. The specific name, &quot;eversmanni&quot;, is in honor of German-born Russian biologist Alexander Eduard Friedrich Eversmann.

==Geographic range==
Geckos of the genus &quot;Crossobamon&quot; live in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia, and Central Asia.

==Description==
Of average size for geckos, about long, the two species are similar in appearance.

<text>Manuel Hanke (born 8 April 1980), known professionally as Manuel Ortega, is an Austrian singer of Spanish origin.

==Biography==
The son of a Spanish mother and an Austrian father, Ortega began his career as a singer when he was 10 years old. He sang with the Florianer Sängerknaben in one of the oldest choirs from Austria. His love for pop music led to him joining a band called BAFF when he was a teenager. Starting from an early age, meant Ortega has been able to make over 200 stages performances as of 2003. When he was 17, he took part in a search for talent and was chosen out of 1300 entrants to be the singer of a new group. Whilst successful, the group was not enough for Ortega and in 2001 he began a solo career.

The song &quot;El Amor, La Vida&quot; was the Austrian summer hit of 2001. In 2002 he represented Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Say A Word&quot;. He participated in the 3rd Season of the Ukrainian Dancing With the Stars (so-called &quot;International League of Champions&quot;) where he danced with the Ukrainian ballroom dancer, and Eurovision Dance Contest 2007 runner-up Yulia Okropiridze.

<text>Cyrtodactylus (Greek κυρτος &quot;kurtos&quot; &quot;curved&quot;, from κυπτω &quot;kuptō&quot; &quot;to stoop&quot;; δακτυλος &quot;daktulos&quot; &quot;finger, toe&quot;) is a diverse genus of Asian geckos, commonly known as bent-toed geckos, bow-fingered geckos, and forest geckos. The genus has 361 described species , which makes it the largest of all gecko genera.

==Description==
Instead of possessing dilated digits like other geckos, members of &quot;Cyrtodactylus&quot; have slender, curved toes to which the common names for the genus can be attributed.

==Taxonomy==
The phylogenetic relationships with this genus and the genus &quot;Geckoella&quot; has not been resolved to date. Based on morphology, suggested that it was a subgenus of &quot;Cyrtodactylus&quot; but a phylogenetic study by , though with inadequate sampling of taxa, restored it to generic status once again. All species of &quot;Geckoella&quot; have been placed here pending a more definitive study.

==Phylogeny==
The following phylogeny is from Pyron, et al. (2013), and includes 22 &quot;Cyrtodactylus&quot; species. &quot;Cyrtodactylus&quot; is a sister group of &quot;Hemidactylus&quot;.
==Species==
The genus &quot;Cyrtodactylus&quot; contains 361 described species, with new species being described frequently.
