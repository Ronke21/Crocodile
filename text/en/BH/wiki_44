The area of present-day Chōfu has been inhabited since Japanese Paleolithic times, and numerous remains from the Jōmon, Yayoi and Kofun periods have been discovered. During the Nara period, it became part of ancient Musashi Province. During the Sengoku period, the area was frequently contested between the Later Hōjō clan and Uesugi clan. During the Edo period, the area prospered as a post station on the Kōshū Kaidō and as a center for sericulture. The origin of the city name &quot;Chōfu&quot; comes from the fact that it was allowed to pay taxes in cloth instead of in rice.

In the post-Meiji Restoration cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, Chōfu Town and neighboring Jindai Village were established within Kanagawa Prefecture. The entire district was transferred to the control of Tokyo Metropolis on April 1, 1893.

<doc id="329705" wikidata="Q348345" url="?curid=329705" title="Donald O'Connor">
<text>Donald David Dixon Ronald O&#x27;Connor (August 28, 1925 – September 27, 2003) was an American dancer, singer and actor. He came to fame in a series of films in which he co-starred, in succession, with Gloria Jean, Peggy Ryan, and Francis the Talking Mule.

O&#x27;Connor was born into a vaudeville family, where he learned to dance, sing, play comedy, and perform slapstick. The most distinctive characteristic of his dancing style was its athleticism, for which he had few rivals. Yet it was his boyish charm that audiences found most engaging, and which remained an appealing aspect of his personality throughout his career. In his Universal musicals of the early 1940s, O&#x27;Connor was a wisecracking, fast-talking teenager, much like Mickey Rooney of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. But by 1952 and &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, MGM had cultivated a much more sympathetic sidekick persona for him, and that remained O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s signature image. 

His best-known work was his &quot;Make &#x27;Em Laugh&quot; dance routine in &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), for which O&#x27;Connor was awarded a Golden Globe. He also won a Primetime Emmy Award from four nominations and received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

O&#x27;Connor was born in 1925 to Vaudevillians Edward &quot;Chuck&quot; O&#x27;Connor and Effie Irene (née Crane) in Chicago, the 200th child born at St. Elizabeth Hospital there. Both the O&#x27;Connors struggled to remember where and when exactly Donald was born, due to the family&#x27;s extensive travel. Effie was a bareback rider and Chuck was a circus strongman and acrobat. His father&#x27;s family was from Ireland.

O&#x27;Connor later said, &quot;I was about 13 months old, they tell me, when I first started dancing, and they&#x27;d hold me up by the back of my neck and they&#x27;d start the music, and I&#x27;d dance. You could do that with any kid, only I got paid for it.&quot;

When O&#x27;Connor was only two years old, he and his seven-year-old sister, Arlene, were hit by a car while crossing the street outside a theater in Hartford, Connecticut; Donald survived, but his sister died. A few weeks later, his father died of a heart attack while dancing on stage in Brockton, Massachusetts.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s mother was extremely possessive of her youngest son due to these traumas, not allowing him to cross the street on his own until he turned 13. Effie also stopped O&#x27;Connor from learning hazardous dance routines, and made sure she always knew where he was when he was not performing.

==Career==
===O&#x27;Connor Family===
O&#x27;Connor joined a dance act with his mother and elder brother Jack. They were billed as the O&#x27;Connor Family, the Royal Family of Vaudeville. They toured the country doing singing, dancing, comedy, and acting. &quot;Our entire family composed an act&quot;, he says. &quot;We really didn&#x27;t have a choice; if you were in the family you appeared in the act. I loved vaudeville. The live audiences created a certain spontaneity.&quot;

When they were not touring they stayed with O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Uncle Bill in Danville, Illinois. O&#x27;Connor never went to school.

He later said, &quot;I learned two dance routines. I looked like the world&#x27;s greatest dancer. I did triple wings and everything. But I had never had any formal training. So, when I went into movies and started working with all those great dancers, I had a terrible time. I couldn&#x27;t pick up routines because I didn&#x27;t have any formal training. At the age of 15 — from 15 on, I really had to learn to dance. And that&#x27;s quite old for someone to start dancing real heavy, professionally.&quot;

Contrasting the vaudevillian style of dance with that of ballet and musicals he observed, &quot;All hoofers, they dance from the waist down. And I had to learn to dance from the waist up. And then, I became what&#x27;s known as a total dancer.&quot;

O&#x27;Connor began performing in movies in 1937, making his debut at age 11 in &quot;Melody for Two&quot; appearing with his family act. He was also in Columbia&#x27;s &quot;It Can&#x27;t Last Forever&quot; (1937).

===Paramount===
O&#x27;Connor signed a contract at Paramount Studios. He appeared in &quot;Men with Wings&quot; (1938), directed by William Wellman, as Fred MacMurray&#x27;s character as a boy. He was billed fifth in &quot;Sing You Sinners&quot; (1938) playing Bing Crosby&#x27;s and MacMurray&#x27;s younger brother.

He was in &quot;Sons of the Legion&quot; (1938), then had the second lead in a B-picture, &quot;Tom Sawyer, Detective&quot; (1938), playing Huckleberry Finn opposite Billy Cook&#x27;s Tom Sawyer. O&#x27;Connor third billed in both &quot;Boy Trouble&quot; (1939) and &quot;Unmarried&quot; (1939), playing John Hartley as a young boy in the latter.

O&#x27;Connor was billed fourth in &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot; (1939) with Betty Grable. He played Gary Cooper as a young boy in &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (1939), directed by Wellman.

&quot;Night Work&quot; (1939) was a sequel to &quot;Boy Trouble&quot; and O&#x27;Connor was in &quot;Death of a Champion&quot; (1939).

He went to Warner Bros to play Eddie Albert as a young boy in &quot;On Your Toes&quot; (1939). He then returned to his family act in vaudeville for two years.

===Universal===
In 1941, O&#x27;Connor signed with Universal Pictures for $200 a week, where he began with &quot;What&#x27;s Cookin&#x27;?&quot; (1942), a low-budget musical with The Andrews Sisters, the studio&#x27;s teenage singing star Gloria Jean, and Peggy Ryan. The film was popular and Universal began to develop O&#x27;Connor and Ryan as their version of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland.

He, Ryan, and the Andrews Sisters were in &quot;Private Buckaroo&quot; (1942) and &quot;Give Out, Sisters&quot; (1942); then he was co-starred opposite Jean in four films: &quot;Get Hep to Love&quot; (1942), &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; (1943), &quot;It Comes Up Love&quot; (1943), and &quot;School for Jive&quot;, which showed O&#x27;Connor to such good advantage that he became the focal point of the film, retitled &quot;Mister Big&quot; (1943). Universal added $50,000 to the budget and elevated the &quot;B&quot; movie to &quot;A&quot; status.

O&#x27;Connor and Ryan were in &quot;Top Man&quot; (1943), with Susanna Foster, and &quot;Chip Off the Old Block&quot; (1944), with Ann Blyth. O&#x27;Connor and Ryan both had cameos in Universal&#x27;s all-star &quot;Follow the Boys&quot; (1944).

During World War II, on his 18th birthday in August 1943, O&#x27;Connor was drafted into the United States Army. Before he reported for induction on February 6, 1944, Universal already had four O&#x27;Connor films completed. They rushed production to complete four more by that date, all with Ryan: &quot;This Is the Life&quot; (1944), with Foster; &quot;The Merry Monahans&quot; (1944), with Blyth and Jack Oakie; &quot;Bowery to Broadway&quot; (1945), another all-star effort where O&#x27;Connor had a cameo; and &quot;Patrick the Great&quot; (1945).

With a backlog of seven features, deferred openings kept O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s screen presence uninterrupted during the two years he was overseas with Special Services in the U.S. Army Air Forces.

===Return from war service===
Finally, the studio paired O&#x27;Connor opposite their biggest female star, Deanna Durbin, in &quot;Something in the Wind&quot; (1947), and kept him busy in musical comedies: &quot;Are You with It?&quot; (1948) with Olga San Juan, &quot;Feudin&#x27;, Fussin&#x27; and A-Fightin&#x27;&quot; (1949) with Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride, and &quot;Yes Sir, That&#x27;s My Baby&quot; (1949) with Gloria DeHaven.

&quot;I wasn&#x27;t really a dancer, a good dancer, until I got older,&quot; he said later. &quot;I could do those wings and stuff and I looked very good, but my heavens, it was very, very hard for me to pick up on — pick up steps. It was just oh — so laborious for me. I didn&#x27;t have a short cut like the other dancers do.&quot;

===&quot;Francis&quot;===
In 1949, O&#x27;Connor played the lead role in &quot;Francis&quot;, the story of a soldier befriended by a talking mule. Directed by Arthur Lubin, the film was a huge success. As a consequence, his musical career was constantly interrupted by production of one &quot;Francis&quot; film per year until 1955. O&#x27;Connor later said the films &quot;were fun to make. Actually, they were quite challenging. I had to play straight in order to convince the audience that the mule could talk.&quot;

O&#x27;Connor followed the first &quot;Francis&quot; with comedies: &quot;Curtain Call at Cactus Creek&quot; (1950), &quot;The Milkman&quot; (1950), and &quot;Double Crossbones&quot; (1951).

He did &quot;Francis Goes to the Races&quot; (1951), another big hit. In February 1951 he signed a new contract with Universal for one film a year for four years, enabling him to work outside the studio.

===&quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;===
In January 1952, O&#x27;Connor signed a three-picture deal with Paramount. He also received an offer to play Cosmo the piano player in &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952) at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer

That film featured his widely known rendition of &quot;Make &#x27;Em Laugh&quot;, which he choreographed with help from the assistant dance directors and his brother. The number featured dozens of jumps, pratfalls, and two backflips launched by running halfway up a wall.

&quot;The scene was building to such a crescendo, I thought I&#x27;d actually have to kill myself,&quot; said O&#x27;Connor. 

He acted alongside Gene Kelly, and earned the 1953 Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy or Musical. 

O&#x27;Connor went back to Universal for &quot;Francis Goes to West Point&quot; (1952) then returned to MGM for &quot;I Love Melvin&quot; (1953) a musical with Debbie Reynolds.

He began appearing regularly on television. One review in 1952 called him &quot;1952&#x27;s new star. Movie bred, he has the versatility of a Jimmy Durante and the effervescence of youth. He can dance, he can sing, he can act, and he can spout humor, but not yet with the finesse of a veteran.&quot;

He supported Ethel Merman in &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; (1953) at 20th Century Fox, later saying the film contained his best dancing. He co-starred in another Fox musical, &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot; (1954), which featured Irving Berlin&#x27;s music and also starred with Ethel Merman, Marilyn Monroe (O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s on screen love interest), Dan Dailey, Mitzi Gaynor, and Johnnie Ray.

After &quot;Francis Covers the Big Town&quot; (1953), Universal put O&#x27;Connor in a musical in color, &quot;Walking My Baby Back Home&quot; (1953) with Janet Leigh.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s industry and public recognition reached a peak in 1954, when he was asked to emcee that year&#x27;s Academy Awards ceremony.

He received excellent notices for &quot;Francis Joins the WACS&quot; (1954) and was scheduled to play Bing Crosby&#x27;s partner in &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954). O&#x27;Connor was forced to withdraw because he contracted an illness transmitted by the mule and was replaced in the film by Danny Kaye.

O&#x27;Connor, resentful of how the &quot;Francis&quot; series had interfered with his musical career, reluctantly agreed to star in &quot;Francis in the Navy&quot; (1955). Arthur Lubin, who directed the series, later recalled that O&#x27;Connor &quot;got very difficult&quot; to work with: &quot;He&#x27;d sit in his dressing room and stare into space, and I think he had problems at home.&quot;

Universal did not renew O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s contract after 13 years with the company. At a farewell luncheon, the studio executives presented him with a gift: a camera and 14 rolls of film. O&#x27;Connor was stunned at the insignificance of the gift after all the millions of dollars he had made for the studio, and in later life recalled, &quot;What can I say about these people?&quot;

O&#x27;Connor and Bing Crosby united on &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (1956) at Paramount. That studio also released &quot;The Buster Keaton Story&quot; (1957), in which O&#x27;Connor had the title role.

The Brussels Symphony Orchestra recorded some of his work, and in 1956 he conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic in a performance of his first symphony, &quot;Reflections d&#x27;Un Comique&quot;.

===Television===
O&#x27;Connor was a regular host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, and starred in &quot;The Donald O&#x27;Connor Show&quot; (1954–55) for one season. 

He hosted a color television special on NBC in 1957, one of the earliest color programs to be preserved on a color kinescope; an excerpt of the telecast was included in NBC&#x27;s 50th anniversary special in 1976.

In the late 1950s, he began guest starring on shows like &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show of the Month&quot;, and &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot;. But his focus moved increasingly to touring live shows.

===1960s===
O&#x27;Connor teamed with Glenn Ford in &quot;Cry for Happy&quot; (1961) at Columbia and he played the title role in &quot;The Wonders of Aladdin&quot; (1961) for MGM.

He subsequently focused on theatre work and his nightclub act, performing in Las Vegas. He returned to Universal for the first time in ten years to make the Sandra Dee comedy &quot;That Funny Feeling&quot; (1965).

He did episodes of &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;, &quot;Vacation Playhouse&quot;, &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot; and &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;. He also appeared in several productions of &quot;Little Me&quot;.

In 1968, O&#x27;Connor hosted a syndicated talk show also called &quot;The Donald O&#x27;Connor Show.&quot; The program was canceled because the dancer was becoming &quot;too political,&quot; and O&#x27;Connor was reprimanded by the studio.

===1970s===
He began to use nitroglycerin pills before performances so that he would have the stamina to complete them. He then suffered a heart attack in 1971, leading him to quit taking the medication.

He was in a TV production of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1971) and continued to perform on stage, notably in Las Vegas.

He guest-starred on episodes of &quot;The Girl with Something Extra&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&quot;, &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, &quot;Police Story&quot;, and &quot;Hunter&quot;.

O&#x27;Connor claimed to have overcome his depression after being hospitalized for three months after collapsing in 1978. He wrote letters to his friends and family explaining that his life had &quot;completely changed&quot;. The dancer was paralyzed from the waist down, but recovered by way of physical therapy. The letters detail the lives of other patients, particularly a 30-year-old man who was completely immobilized.

&quot;I won&#x27;t take anything I have for granted again,&quot; was written in each letter. O&#x27;Connor credited the patients he met and thanked God for allowing him to recover.

===1980s===
He appeared as a gaslight-era entertainer in the 1981 film &quot;Ragtime&quot;, notable for similar encore performances by James Cagney and Pat O&#x27;Brien. It was his first feature film role in 16 years.

O&#x27;Connor appeared in the short-lived &quot;Bring Back Birdie&quot; on Broadway in 1981. The following year he was in &quot;I Ought to Be in Pictures&quot; in Los Angeles.

He was Cap&#x27;n Andy in a short-lived Broadway revival of &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1983) and continued to tour in various shows and acts.

&quot;I&#x27;ve been on the road forever,&quot; he said in 1985, adding &quot;I&#x27;d consider another movie or a TV series, but I won&#x27;t play an old man. Art Carney is about my age and he&#x27;s making a career out of being old. I&#x27;m still singing and dancing. I&#x27;m not ready to be old.&quot;

O&#x27;Connor guest starred on &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, and &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;, and was in the films &quot;Pandemonium&quot; (1982), &quot;A Mouse, a Mystery and Me&quot; (1988), and &quot;A Time to Remember&quot; (1988).

He bought a theatre, the Donald O&#x27;Connor Theatre, and would perform in it with his children. In a 1989 interview he said &quot;There&#x27;s an element out there that wants to be entertained-and they can&#x27;t find this kind of thing I do. And yeah, I think I wear well. I sing, I dance, I do comedy. I&#x27;m not threatening. When you grow up in a circus family, the more things you learn, the more you get paid. So I can do straight comedy without the song and dance; I can do all kinds of combinations. Whatever&#x27;s in at the time, I can fit into.&quot;

He developed heart trouble and underwent successful quadruple-bypass surgery in 1990.

===1990s===
O&#x27;Connor continued to make film and television appearances into the 1990s, including the Robin Williams film &quot;Toys&quot; (1992) as the president of a toy-making company. He continued to perform live.

He had guest roles in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, &quot;The Building&quot;, &quot;The Nanny&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot;, and was in the films &quot;&quot; (1994), and &quot;Father Frost&quot; (1996).

In 1992, he said, &quot;I never wanted to be a superstar. I&#x27;m working on being a quasar, because stars wear out. Quasars go on forever... I look for the parts where I die and they talk about me for the rest of the movie.&quot;

In 1998, he received a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s last feature film was the Jack Lemmon-Walter Matthau comedy &quot;Out to Sea&quot;, in which he played a dance host on a cruise ship. O&#x27;Connor was still making public appearances well into 2003. He said he went on the road &quot;about 32 weeks a year. I do my concert work and I do night clubs and that kind of stuff. So I don&#x27;t dance much any more, but I do enough to show people I can still move my legs.&quot;

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Connor was married twice and had four children. His first marriage was in 1944 to Gwendolyn Carter, when he was 18 and she was 20. They married in Tijuana. Together they had one child, a daughter Donna. The couple divorced in 1954. During the turbulent nine-year marriage, Carter physically abused O&#x27;Connor in frustration over her lack of an acting career. In the divorce Carter was given ownership of their home and custody of their daughter. According to reports at the time the couple split, O&#x27;Connor was left with only the dog and sought the help of multiple psychiatrists. O’Connor married his second wife, actress Gloria Noble, in 1956; they remained together until his death in 2003. They had three children, son Donald Frederick, daughter Alicia, and son Kevin. Noble died in 2013. 

O&#x27;Connor was honored with a retrospective at New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center and an honorary degree from Boston University. He chose to keep much of his philanthropy work private. Some of it includes work for the United States Army and Red Cross. He created the Donald O&#x27;Connor Alcoholism Counseling Scholarship. 

He was married to Gloria Noble from October 11, 1956 until his death. They had three children: Alice, Fred, and Kevin. They were married for 47 years and lived in Thousand Oaks, California. Gloria died on June 11, 2013, of natural causes.

O&#x27;Connor had undergone quadruple heart bypass surgery in 1990, and he nearly died from pleural pneumonia in January 1999. He died from complications of heart failure on September 27, 2003, at age 78 at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital, in Woodland Hills, California.

The average annual rainfall is 1647 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.4 °C, and lowest in January, at around 2.5 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kunitachi expanded rapidly in the postwar decades and has continued to grow at a slower rate since then.

== History ==
Kunitachi lies along the historical Kōshū Kaidō, a route that connected Edo with Kofu in the province of Kai (present-day Yamanashi Prefecture). The area was noted for its abundant spring water. The villages of Ishida, Aoyagi and Yabo were created within Tama District of Kanagawa Prefecture during the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. The district was transferred from Kanagawa to Tokyo in 1893. In the 1920, much of the land was obtained by Kojiro Tsutsumi, the founder of Seibu, who began large-scale development of a planned community, which he intended to become a university town modeled after Göttingen in Germany. The Tokyo University of Commerce (Hitotsubashi University) was relocated from central Tokyo to this location, and a train station was opened on Chūō Main Line in 1926. The station was named &quot;Kunitachi&quot;, taking one &quot;kanji&quot; from the names of the stations to either side, namely Kokubunji Station and Tachikawa Station. The three villages were merged to form Kunitachi town in 1951. Kunitachi was elevated to city status on January 1, 1967.

==Government==

Kunitachi has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 22 members. Kunitachi, together with Kokubunji, contributes two members to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Tokyo 21st district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

===Climate===
Fussa has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Fussa is 13.9 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1998 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.3 °C, and lowest in January, at around 2.4 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Fussa peaked around the year 2000 and has declined slightly since then.

==History==

The area of present-day Fussa was part of ancient Musashi Province. During the Edo period, it was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate and administered by various &quot;hatamoto&quot;. The area was agricultural and noted for silkworms and &quot;sake&quot; production. After the Meiji Restoration, the 26 hamlets in the area consolidated into the villages of Fussa, Kumagawa and Tama within the short-lived Shinagawa Prefecture, followed by Kanagawa Prefecture. Parts of the area were involved in the Chichibu Incident of 1884.

The entire district was transferred to the control of Tokyo Metropolis on April 1, 1893, and the Ōme Railway joined Fussa to Tachikawa the following year. Fussa was elevated to town status in 1940, and an airfield for the Imperial Japanese Army was built, and became the central aircraft testing facility for the Army in 1942. During World War II, the area was only lightly bombed (once in 1945, with four casualties), and the military facilities were seized mostly intact by the American military after the war. In the post-war era, Fussa expanded rapidly through the construction of subsidized housing districts, and was elevated to city status on April 1, 1970 .

==Government==
Fussa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 19 members. Fussa, collectively with Hamura, Akiruno, Mizuho, Hinode, Hinohara and Okutama contributes two members to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Tokyo 25th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Fussa, along with its neighboring cities Iruma and Tachikawa, contains a strong military presence. A large portion of the city&#x27;s economy focuses on the bases and servicing those who live there. Of note is eastern Fussa&#x27;s &quot;Bar Row&quot; district, a historic though seedy collection of karaoke bars, shot bars, and massage parlors. The Bar Row area has been a fixture of Fussa nightlife catering to US military personnel since the 1950s. The city also serves as a bedroom community for central Tokyo and a regional commercial center.

<doc id="329708" wikidata="Q86536" url="?curid=329708" title="Komae, Tokyo">
<text>is a city located in the western portion of the Tokyo Metropolis, Japan. It is one of 30 municipalities in the western portion of Tokyo known as the Tama Area. , the city had an estimated population of 83,218, and a population density of 13,000 persons per km2. The total area of the city is . It is the smallest administrative city in Tokyo Metropolis both in area and population, and the second smallest in terms of area in the nation.

==Geography==

Komae is nestled between the Tama River to the southwest, and the much smaller Nogawa River to the north and east which flows near its boundaries with Chōfu city and Setagaya Ward. It is mostly flat. It is a small municipality; its boundaries fit within a circle of 2 km radius centred on the city hall. It is essentially a residential suburb of Tokyo which urbanised rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s, with most of the working population commuting to central Tokyo. There are several neighbourhood shopping areas, mainly around the train stations. The City Hall is located near Komae Station.

===Surrounding municipalities===
Kanagawa Prefecture
*Kawasaki
Tokyo Metropolis
*Chōfu
*Setagaya

===Climate===
Komae has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Komae is 14.8 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1647 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.0 °C, and lowest in January, at around 3.8 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Komae increased rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s and has continued to grow at a slower rate since then.

==History==
The city&#x27;s name is thought to originate from the word &quot;koma&quot;, referring to migrants, especially Goguryeo from the Korean peninsula who settled here around the 5th century AD. Numerous &quot;kofun&quot; burial mounds are located within the city borders.

The area of present-day Komae was part of ancient Musashi Province. In the post-Meiji Restoration cadastral reform of July 22, 1878, the area became part of Minamitama District in Kanagawa Prefecture. The town of Komae was created on April 1, 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Minamitama District was transferred to the administrative control of Tokyo Metropolis on April 1, 1893. Odakyu Railways&#x27;s Odawara line was constructed through Komae in 1926, linking it with Shinjuku in central Tokyo. Expanding population led to Komae being upgraded to the status of a town in 1952, and to a city on October 1, 1970.

On September 1, 1974, Tama River&#x27;s levee failed during a typhoon, and 19 houses were destroyed by torrential flooding. The riverbanks have now been strengthened. A small memorial stands at the location of the levee failure.

==Government==
Komae has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 26 members. The current mayor is Kunihiko Takahashi, an independent heading a coalition of the Democratic Party of Japan with the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan and the Komeito, which ousted long-term Japanese Communist Party mayor Yutaka Yano in 2012. Komae, together with the city of Chōfu, contributes three members to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Tokyo 26th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.
==Education==
The one public high school, Komae High School, is operated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education.

* a dialect form of the Japanese word for &quot;walnut&quot;
* a word meaning &quot;small, flat place&quot;
* The theory that the &quot;Kurome&quot; of the Kuromegawa River：黒目川 flowing through the city turns into the place name of &quot;Kurume&quot;. Originally, the Kurome River was also called &quot;Kurume&quot; River, the later people used the kanji notation such as Kurume＝久留米or久留目or来梅・Kurome＝黒目etc. . This was later recognised as the most likely theory.

At the time of the founding of the city, the name was changed to &quot;Higashikurume&quot; in order to avoid being confused for Kurume, Fukuoka. Since the new name already had already existed since 1915 as the name of the local train station, the name was already familiar to residents and adopted quickly.

<text>Batman Province (, ; ) is a province in Turkey. It was created in May 1990 with the Law No. 3647 taking some parts from the eastern Province of Siirt and some from the southern Province of Mardin. Its area is 4,477 km2, and its population is 634,491 (2022). Its current governor is Ekrem Canalp.

The province is considered part of Turkish Kurdistan and has a Kurdish majority.

==History==
The Batman Province contains the strategic Tigris river with fertile lands by its sides, as well as rocky hills with numerous caves providing a natural shelter. Therefore, it was inhabited from prehistoric times, likely from the Neolithic (Paleolithic) period, according to archeological evidence. First documented evidence of settlements in the province dates back to 7th century BC. An artificial &quot;island&quot; was created in this marshy area. It was named &quot;Elekhan&quot;, and had an independent status for 194 years from 546 BC till the invasion of Alexander the Great in 334 BC. The Batman Province was a religious center in the 4th–6th centuries AD and a part of the Byzantine Empire. In the 11th–12th centuries it was ruled by the Great Seljuq Empire and Artuqids, a part of which was based in the province, in the city of Hasankeyf. The city is a cultural center of the Batman Province and as such was declared as a natural conservation area in 1981.

Around 4th–6th centuries AD the province became an outpost of the Silk Road. It was populated by Assyrian Christians and Armenians, also had a significant presence of Pontic Greeks, Baghdadi Jews.
Significant changes in the language and management of the province were brought in 1515 by Mahmoud Pasha Elekhani. It is believed that a variant of his name, &quot;Elah&quot;, was transformed into &quot;Iluh&quot; and gave the old name to Batman city.

From July 1987 to October 1997 Batman Province was included in the OHAL state of emergency region.

Development of oil fields resulted in relocation of Turkish people into a mostly Kurd-populated Batman Province. This brought ethnic conflicts which escalated in the 1990s. More than 180 civilians were killed in the Batman city area by unidentified gunmen between 1992 and 1993. The province became a stronghold of the Kurdish Hezbollah, a Kurdish Sunni Islamist organization, and it was reported that Batman hosted a camp where the militants received military and political training.

Recent individual incidents include the following: 1 Turkish soldier was killed and 2 wounded during clashes in the province on 15 April 2010. Four Kurdish civilians were killed on 1 August 2010 after their vehicle struck a roadside bomb.

== Geography ==
The province occupies an area of . It lies in a mountainous area with the average elevation of 550 meters which contains several thousands of caves. The tallest mountains are Sason Dağları (2500 m), Meleto (2967 m), Kuşaklı Dağı (1947 m), Avcı Dağı (2121 m), Meydanok Tepesi (2042 m), Kortepe (2082 m) and Raman Dağı (1288 m). Several rivers ( or ) flow through the province, including Tigris, Batman, Sason and Garzan. The long Batman River flowing approximately from north to south forms a natural border between the Batman Province and Diyarbakır Province lying to the west. The historic Malabadi Bridge (built in 1146–1147) crosses the river near the town of Silvan. The Tigris flows from west to east, merges with the Batman River and exits the province. The Garzan River flowing from north to south enters the Tigris and separates Batman from the Siirt Province lying to the east. The province is also of interest from an archaeological point of view. Sights include the Imam Abdullah Dervish monastery, the bridge of Camiü‘r Rızk and Hasankeyf.

===Districts===
The province is divided into six districts:
* Batman
* Beşiri
* Gercüş
* Hasankeyf
* Kozluk
* Sason

There are 289 villages in the province.
== Demographics ==
The population of the province is rapidly growing as a result of the inflow of workforce to the capital. Between 1990 and 2000, its population was rising at a rate of 5% per year. The population was stable in Beşiri and Gercüş, increasing by 1% per year in Kozluk and Sason and decreasing by 3% per year in Hasankeyf. The total population was 634,491 in 2022.

==Oil industry==
Search for oil in the Batman Province was started in 1935. On 20 April 1940, oil was found at a depth of 1048 meters at the Raman oil field, south-east of Batman, nearby the city. The first experimental well started producing 10 tonnes (about 62 barrels) per day from 6 June 1940.

The field was expanded for commercial production by 1945, but the production was delayed to 1947 by the lack of storage. A small refinery was built at the site with a capacity of 9 tonnes/day by 1947 and by November 1948 a bigger refinery capable of processing up to 200 tonnes/day was built in Batman. An even bigger refinery (330 tonnes/d) was built in Batman by 1955. Several other oil fields were later discovered in the province with the Batı Raman oil field, which produces about 7,000 barrels daily, being the largest oil field in Turkey. A long oil pipeline was brought in 1967 from Batman to the port city of Dörtyol near the easternmost point of the Mediterranean coast to transport the Batman crude oil. The pipeline has an annual capacity of 3.5 million tonnes and was transporting about 20 million barrels (about 2.7 million tonnes) in the 1990s and about twice less between 2003 and 2007. Another, short () pipeline connected Batman with Şelmo – the location of the second largest oil field in Turkey. It was transferring between 1.5 and 0.5 million barrels per year in the period 1990–2007. Both pipelines are operated by BOTAŞ.

==Batman dam==
The Batman dam construction was started in 1986 and completed in 1999. It has a height of 85 meters and an annual power generation capacity of 483 GWh (peak power 198 MW). The associated reservoir has a surface area of 49 km2 and a volume of 1.175 km3. The dam supplies water for an area of .

The project was backed by high-profile executives Tetsuzo Matsumoto of Softbank and Norio Murakami of Google. Michihito Matsuda came third in the election, being defeated by Hiroyuki Abe. Organisers claimed that the &#x27;AI mayor&#x27; was programmed to analyze citizen petitions put forward to the city council in a more &#x27;fair and balanced&#x27; way than human politicians.

==Geography==
Inagi is located in the south-central portion of Tokyo Metropolis, approximately 25 kilometers from the center of Tokyo. The Tama River flows through the city, which is bordered by Kanagawa Prefecture to the south.

===Surrounding municipalities===
Tokyo Metropolis
*Chōfu
*Fuchū
*Tama
Kanagawa Prefecture
*Kawasaki

===Climate===

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Inagi has increased steadily since the 1950s.

==History==
The area of Inagi has been settled since the Japanese Paleolithic, or for over 20,000 years, based on projectile points, stone tools and microliths found in several locations within city borders. There is evidence of several Jomon period settlements, but settlement disappeared towards the end of the Jomon period due to climate change and eruptions of Mount Fuji. The area was sparely settled in the Yayoi period, with increasing settlement density in the Kofun period. A number of Nara period remains have been found, including the ruins of a roof tile kiln. During the Heian period, the area became part of a &quot;shōen&quot; controlled by the Oyamada clan, and later by their cadet branch, the Inabe clan into the Kamakura period, and was an area contested between competing branches of the Ashikaga clan and Uesugi clan in the Muromachi and Sengoku periods. After the start of the Edo period, the area was &quot;tenryō&quot; controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. Inagi as a municipality was founded on April 1, 1889 as a village in what was then Minamitama District, Kanagawa Prefecture, from the merger of 6 pre-Meiji period hamlets with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. The district was transferred to the administrative control of Tokyo Metropolis on April 1, 1893.

On April 1, 1957, Inagi Village was promoted to town status, and to city status on November 1, 1971.

==Government==
Inagi has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 22 members. Inagi, together with the city of Tama, contributes two members to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly. In elections to the lower house of the Diet of Japan, the city is a part of the Tokyo 30th district.

<text>Stephen Weaver Collins (born October 1, 1947) is an American former actor. He is known for playing Eric Camden on the WB/CW television series &quot;7th Heaven&quot; from 1996 to 2007. Afterwards, Collins played the roles of Dayton King on the ABC television series &quot;No Ordinary Family&quot; and Gene Porter in the NBC television series &quot;Revolution&quot;, father of Elizabeth Mitchell&#x27;s character, Rachel Matheson. Before &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, Collins was known for his roles as Commander Willard Decker in the 1979 film &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; and fighter pilot Jake Cutter in the ABC television series &quot;Tales of the Gold Monkey&quot;. In 2014, his career ended after he confessed to sexual misconduct against multiple minors.

== Early life ==
Stephen Collins was born on October 1, 1947, in Des Moines, Iowa, to mother Madeleine (née Robertson) and father Cyrus Stickney Collins, an airline executive. Collins was raised with his two older brothers in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, and attended Amherst College in Massachusetts, graduating &quot;cum laude.&quot; While at Amherst, he played bass guitar in a number of bands. He was also then a singing member of the Amherst College Zumbyes.

== Career ==
Stephen Collins is known for his role as Eric Camden in the television drama series &quot;7th Heaven&quot; during the series&#x27; run from 1996 to 2007 and for his role as Captain Willard Decker in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979). His other notable television credits include Jake Cutter in the cult series &quot;Tales of the Gold Monkey&quot; and his role in &quot;Tattingers&quot;, as well as guest appearances in &quot;The Waltons&quot;, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, and numerous miniseries and television films. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for his work opposite Ann-Margret in the miniseries &quot;The Two Mrs. Grenvilles&quot; (1987), and played John F. Kennedy in the miniseries &quot;A Woman Named Jackie&quot; (1991), which won the Emmy for Best Miniseries. He also played the lead role opposite Lauren Hutton in the television film &quot;The Rhinemann Exchange&quot; (1977), based on Robert Ludlum&#x27;s bestselling novel.

Collins was above-the-title billed in &quot;Loving Couples&quot; (1980) with Shirley MacLaine, James Coburn and Susan Sarandon. He co-starred with Diane Keaton in both &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; (1996) and &quot;Because I Said So&quot; (2007). He has co-starred with Meredith Baxter in three films, &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men,&quot; &quot;A Woman Scorned: The Betty Broderick Story,&quot; and &quot;Her Final Fury: Betty Broderick, the Last Chapter&quot;, both of which were television films broadcast on CBS in 1992.

In the 2010–11 television season, Collins starred in the short-lived ABC series &quot;No Ordinary Family&quot;. On ABC&#x27;s &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, he played a potential love interest for Ron Rifkin&#x27;s character Saul Holden. Collins appeared in season eight of &quot;The Office&quot; playing Andy Bernard&#x27;s father in the episode, &quot;Garden Party&quot;.

In 2013, Collins began appearing in the NBC series &quot;Revolution&quot; as Dr. Gene Porter, the leader of the town of Willoughby and father of Rachel Matheson (played by Elizabeth Mitchell). and in two episodes of &quot;Falling Skies&quot; in season three. Collins&#x27; final guest spots include &quot;The Fosters&quot;, &quot;Devious Maids&quot;, and &quot;Penance&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Stephen Collins was married to Marjorie Weinman from 1970 to 1978. In 1985, he married actress Faye Grant, whom he had met on the set of &quot;Tales of the Gold Monkey&quot; in 1982. Together they have a daughter, Kate, who was born in 1989. They separated in 2012, and, after 30 years of marriage, a final divorce decree was issued in January 2015.

Collins is an Episcopalian and a practitioner of Transcendental Meditation (TM) and has taken part in the advanced TM Yogic Flying technique since 1980. Until October 2014, he was a national co-director of the Committee for Stress-Free Schools, which advocates practicing TM in schools and funds TM research.

His nephew is Eve 6 frontman Max Collins.

== Sexual abuse against minors ==
On October 7, 2014, the New York City Police Department began investigating Collins after an audio tape leaked to the media revealed a male voice, purported to be that of Collins, admitting to past sexual abuse of a minor under the age of 14.

A Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson stated that Collins had been investigated by the department in 2012 after receiving a claim from 18 years earlier regarding sexual abuse. The LAPD further stated that its investigation did not allow it to &quot;substantiate the allegation&quot; against Collins.

In a December 2014 interview with &quot;People&quot;, Collins admitted that he committed &quot;inappropriate sexual conduct with three female minors&quot; in 1973, 1982, and 1994.

<doc id="329734" wikidata="Q1133777" url="?curid=329734" title="Cornelius Krieghoff">
<text>Cornelius David Krieghoff (June 19, 1815 – March 5, 1872) was a Dutch-born Canadian-American painter of the 19th century. He is best known for his paintings of Canadian genre scenes involving landscapes and outdoor life, which were as sought after in his own time as they are today. He painted many winter scenes, some in several variants (e.g. &quot;Running the Toll&quot;).

== Life and career ==
Krieghoff was born in Amsterdam, Kingdom of the Netherlands. When Cornelius was a boy, his father Johann Ernst Krieghoff returned to Germany (Krieghoff was likely German extraction via Lorenz Krieghoff of Thuringia) and worked for Wilhem Sattler to establish a wallpaper factory. His family was given accommodations in Schloss Mainberg, a 12th-century castle owned by Sattler, situated overlooking the Main River. He was initially taught by his father and then entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Germany about 1830. He moved to New York in 1836, and enlisted in the First Regiment of Artillery in the United States Army in 1837. While in the army, he made sketches of the Second Seminole War. He was discharged as Corporal from the army in 1840. Krieghoff traveled to Paris in 1844, where he copied masterpieces at the Louvre under the direction of Michel Martin Drolling (1789–1851).

With his wife, Émilie Gauthier, he moved to Montreal around 1846 and participated in the founding of the Montreal Society of Artists in 1847. While in Montreal, he befriended the Mohawks living on the Kahnawake Indian Reservation and made many sketches of them from which he later produced oil paintings.

He and his family (daughter Emily) moved to Quebec City in 1853. He returned to Europe in 1854, visiting Italy and Germany. In 1855, he returned to Canada. He served for a short time in the Volunteer Militia Company of Engineers, (a Canadian Militia unit in Hochelaga, Montreal), then lived in Europe from 1863 to 1868 and moved to Chicago to retire. He died in Chicago on March 5, 1872, at the age of 56 and is buried in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago. A decade later, on June 8, 1881, the Great Quebec Fire destroyed many of the sketches he had done at the time of his service In the First Regiment of Artillery in Florida, which were owned at the time by John S. Budden, who had lived with the artist for thirteen years.

According to Charles C. Hill, the former Curator of Canadian Art at the National Gallery of Canada, &quot;Krieghoff was the first Canadian artist to interpret in oils... the splendour of our waterfalls, and the hardships and daily life of people living on the edge of new frontiers&quot;.

== Collections ==
Public collections holding works by Cornelius Krieghoff include the Art Gallery of Hamilton (Hamilton, Canada), the Art Gallery of Ontario (Toronto, Canada), the Beaverbrook Art Gallery (Fredericton, Canada), the Brooklyn Museum (New York City), the Glenbow Museum (Calgary, Canada), the McCord Museum (Montreal, Canada), the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (Montreal, Canada), Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec (Quebec, Canada), the National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa, Canada), the New York Public Library (New York City), the Rockwell Museum (Corning, New York), the Winnipeg Art Gallery (Winnipeg, Canada) and the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia (Halifax, Canada).

The greatest accumulation of Krieghoff paintings ever assembled, at over two hundred, was once part of the vast private collection of billionaire newspaper and television magnate, Ken Thompson and is in the Thomson Collection on view at the Art Gallery of Ontario today.

In February 1977, Thomson, Canada’s top fine art collector, suddenly found his collection had become a top news story in several of his own papers—from The Globe and Mail in Toronto, to The Times of London—after quietly inviting English art forger Tom Keating to come to his top floor office at Thomson Tower to check if any of his cherished Krieghoffs were fakes. Keating was under investigation by the Art and Antiques squad at Scotland Yard for selling several fake Krieghoffs in the UK, and he claimed to have painted several hundred of them, mostly in the 1950s.

Curators at the Art Gallery of Ontario (to whom Thomson later donated nearly two thousand artworks worth over (US) three hundred million dollars) held their breath when, media herd in tow, their collection was inspected by the notorious art forger. Keating denied finding any of his pastiches in Thomson&#x27;s collection, nor at the AGO, nor at any of several other Canadian fine art institutions he carefully scrutinized. He professed relief that his vendetta against greedy art merchants had not tarnished the fine collections he felt privileged to tour and study over the course of his three-week visit. In February 1979, while giving evidence in his art fraud trial at the Old Bailey, he did say he was told in the 1950s that seventeen Krieghoffs in Lord Beaverbrook&#x27;s collection were fakes by him. Asked to come inspect them, he refused, saying: &#x27;Why waste the money? Try X-rays&#x27;.

== Recognition ==
In 1955, the National Film Board of Canada released the award-winning documentary &quot;The Jolifou Inn&quot;. The 10-minute film, directed by Colin Low and produced by Tom Daly, depicts 19th-century Québec life, as Krieghoff would have seen it, and uses his work to illustrate his source of inspiration.
On November 29, 1972, Canada Post issued &#x27;Cornelius Krieghoff, painter, 1815–1872&#x27; designed by William Rueter based on a painting &quot;The Blacksmith&#x27;s Shop&quot; (1871), by Cornelius Krieghoff in the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario. The 8¢ stamps are perforated 11 and were printed by British American Bank Note Company.

On July 7, 2000, Canada Post issued &#x27;The Artist at Niagara, 1858, Cornelius Krieghoff&#x27; in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on an oil painting &quot;The Artist at Niagara&quot; (1858) by Cornelius Krieghoff in the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario. The 95¢ stamps are perforated 13 x 13.5 mm and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.

== Auction record ==
The auction record for a painting by Cornelius Krieghoff is $570,000 Canadian. This record was set by &quot;Mail boat landing at Quebec&quot;, a 17 by 24 inch oil painting on canvas sold November 20, 2006, at Sotheby&#x27;s &amp; Ritchies (Toronto).

<text>The [[Romani people]] have long been a part of the collective mythology of the West, where they were (and very often still are) depicted as outsiders, aliens, and a threat. For centuries they were enslaved in Eastern Europe and hunted in Western Europe: the Pořajmos, Hitler&#x27;s attempt at genocide, was one violent link in a chain of persecution that encompassed countries generally considered more tolerant of minorities, such as the United Kingdom. Even today, while there is a surge of Romani self-identification and pride, restrictive measures are being debated and passed by democratic states to curb the rights of the Romani people.

It is generally thought that the Romanies, because they had no written language until relatively recently, have origins obscured by some mythical past. Although there are many unanswered questions, much more is known about the Romanies than is assumed. The greater problem in attempting a comprehensive history of the Romanies is their distribution, not only throughout Europe, but also in the Middle East and the Americas. In each region, Romani history diverged, depending on the attitudes of the host population. For instance, although slavery and serfdom are key themes in the history of Romani in the Eastern Europe, other forms of persecution, including early forms of genocide, are preponderant in Western Europe.

What is not often considered is how the implications of this shatter traditional myths about the Romanies. For example, Romanies are considered to be nomadic, which was largely true in Western Europe; however, the fact that they were slaves and serfs in the Balkans since at least the 15th century (and until the late 19th century) implies that they were settled. Between 1933 and 1945 Roma and Sinti suffered greatly as victims of Nazi persecution and genocide. Building on long-held prejudices, the Nazi regime viewed Roma both as &quot;asocials&quot; (outside “normal” society) and as racial &quot;inferiors&quot; believed to threaten the biological purity and strength of the “superior Aryan” race

<text>Cornell Law School is the law school of Cornell University, a private, Ivy League university in Ithaca, New York.

One of the five Ivy League law schools, Cornell Law School offers four degree programs (JD, LLM, MSLS and JSD) along with several dual-degree programs in conjunction with other professional schools at the university. It was established in 1887 as Cornell University&#x27;s Department of Law. Currently, the school graduates around 200 students each year.

Cornell Law School is home to the Legal Information Institute (LII), the &quot;Journal of Empirical Legal Studies&quot;, the &quot;Cornell Law Review&quot;, the &quot;Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy&quot;, and the &quot;Cornell International Law Journal&quot;. 

== History ==
=== 19th century ===
The Law Department at Cornell opened in 1887 in Morrill Hall with Judge Douglass Boardman as its first dean. At that time, admission did not require even a high school diploma. In 1917, two years of undergraduate education were required for admission, and in 1924, it became a graduate degree program. The department was renamed the Cornell Law School in 1925. In 1890, George Washington Fields graduated, one of the first law school graduates of color in the United States. In 1893, Cornell had its first female graduate, Mary Kennedy Brown. Future Governor, Secretary of State, and Chief Justice of the United States, Charles Evans Hughes, was a professor of law at Cornell from 1891 to 1893, and after returning to legal practice he continued to teach at the law school as a special lecturer from 1893 to 1895. Hughes Hall, one of the law school&#x27;s central buildings, is named in his honor.

In 1892, the school moved into Boardman Hall, which was constructed specifically for legal instruction. The school moved from Boardman Hall (now the site of Olin Library) to its present-day location at Myron Taylor Hall in 1932. The law school building, an ornate, Gothic structure, was the result of a donation by Myron Charles Taylor, a former CEO of US Steel, and a member of the Cornell Law class of 1894. 

=== 20th century ===
Hughes Hall was built as an addition to Myron Taylor Hall and completed in 1963. It was also funded by a gift from Taylor. Another addition to Myron Taylor Hall, the Jane M.G. Foster wing, was completed in 1988 and added more space to the library. Foster was a member of the class of 1918, an editor of the &quot;Cornell Law Review&quot; (then &quot;Cornell Law Quarterly&quot;), and an Order of the Coif graduate. 

In 1948, Cornell Law School established a program of specialization in international affairs and also started awarding LL.B. degrees. In 1968, the school began to publish the &quot;Cornell International Law Journal.&quot; In 1991, the school established the Berger International Legal Studies Program. In 1994, the school established a partnership with the University of Paris I law faculty to establish a Paris-based Summer Institute of International and Comparative Law. 

=== 21st century ===
From 1999 to 2004 the school hosted the Feminism and Legal Theory Project. In 2006, the school established its second summer law institute in Suzhou, China. The Clarke Program in East Asian Law and Culture was established in 2002.

In June 2012, the school embarked on a multi-year, multi-phase expansion and renovation. The first phase created additional classroom space underground, adjacent to Myron Taylor Hall along College Avenue. The second phase included the removal and digitization of printed materials from the library stacks so that the space could be converted into additional classroom and student space. The third phase involved converting Hughes Hall into office space. As a result, Myron Taylor Hall saw the addition of 40,000 square feet of underground classroom space. The renovation of Hughes Hall was completed in 2017.

==Academics==
=== Degree programs ===
Cornell has offered LL.M and J.S.D degrees since 1928. The joint JD/MBA (with Cornell&#x27;s Johnson School of Management) has three- and four-year tracks, The JD/MILR program is four years, the JD/MPA is four years, and the JD/MRP is four years.

In addition, Cornell has joint program arrangements with universities abroad to prepare students for international licensure:

* Joint program with University of Paris (La Sorbonne) (JD/Master en Droit)
* Joint program with Humboldt University of Berlin (JD/M.LL.P)
* Joint program with Institut d’Études Politiques de Paris (JD/Master in Global Business Law)

The JD/Master en Droit lasts four years and prepares graduates for admission to the bar in the United States and France. The JD/M.LL.P is three years old and conveys a mastery of German and European law and practices. The JD/Master in Global Business Law lasts three years. 

Cornell Law School runs two summer institutes overseas, providing Cornell Law students with unique opportunities to engage in rigorous international legal studies. The Cornell-Université de Paris I Summer Institute of International and Comparative Law at the Sorbonne in Paris, France offers a diverse curriculum in the historic Sorbonne and Centre Panthéon (Faculté de Droit) buildings at the heart of the University of Paris I: Panthéon-Sorbonne. Coursework includes international human rights, comparative legal systems, and international commercial arbitration. French language classes are also offered.

In 2006, Cornell Law School announced that it would launch a second summer law institute, the new Workshop in International Business Transactions with Chinese Characteristics in Suzhou, China. In partnership with Bucerius Law School (Germany) and Kenneth Wang School of Law at Soochow University (China), Cornell Law provides students from the United States, Europe, and China with an academic forum in which they can collaborate on an international business problem.

=== Rankings ===
Cornell Law School was ranked 2nd in the 2023 &quot;Above the Law&quot; rankings, which prioritizes career outcomes above all other factors. In 2023, Cornell Law was ranked 1st (in a tie) with an &quot;A+&quot; rating by &quot;The National Jurist&quot; in the &quot;Best Schools for Law Firm Employment&quot; listing. The school ranked 13th in the 2023-2024 U.S. News &amp; World Report Law School rankings.

=== Admissions ===

Cornell Law School is extremely selective: the median LSAT for the 2024 entering class was 173 (98th percentile among all test takers) and the 75th percentile was 175 (99th percentile among all test takers). The median undergraduate GPA was 3.89.

For the 2021 LL.M. program, which is designed for non-U.S.-trained lawyers, 900 applications were received for the 50 to 60 openings. LL.M. students come from over 30 different countries.

Along with consideration of the quality of an applicant&#x27;s academic record and LSAT scores, the full-file-review admissions process places a heavy emphasis on an applicant&#x27;s statement, letters of recommendation, community and extracurricular involvement, and work experience. The application also invites a statement on diversity and a short note on why an applicant particularly wants to attend Cornell. The law school values applicants who have done their research and have particular interests or goals that would be served by attending the school versus one of its peer institutions.

=== Campus ===
Cornell Law is housed within Myron Taylor Hall (erected 1932), which contains the Law Library, classrooms, offices, a moot courtroom, and the Cornell Legal Aid Clinic.

==== Library ====

The law library contains 700,000 books and microforms and includes rare historical texts relevant to the legal history of the United States. The library is one of the 12 national depositories for print records of briefs filed with the United States Supreme Court.

The large microfilm collection has sets of Congressional, Supreme Court, and United Nations documents, as well as a large collection of World Law Reform Commission materials. Microfiche records and briefs for the United States Supreme Court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and D.C. Circuit, and the New York State Court of Appeals are also collected. The library also has a large collection of international, foreign, and comparative law, with the main focus being on the Commonwealth of Nations and Europe. Along with this, there are also collections of public international law and international trade law. A new initiative by the library is to collect Chinese, Japanese, and Korean resources to support the law school&#x27;s Clarke Program in East Asian Law and Culture.

Rare books in the library include the Samuel Thorne collection, which has 175 of some of the earliest and most rare books on law. Other significant collections include the Nathaniel C. Moak Library and the Edwin J. Marshall Collection of early works on equity and the Earl J. Bennett Collection of Statutory Material, a print collection of original colonial, territorial, and state session laws and statutory codes. Among the library&#x27;s special collections are the 19th Century Trials Collection, Donovan Nuremberg Trials Collection, Scottsboro Collection, William P. and Adele Langston Rogers Collection and the Chile Declassification Project.

<text>The Mariana Islands ( ; ), also simply the Marianas, are a crescent-shaped archipelago comprising the summits of fifteen longitudinally oriented, mostly dormant volcanic mountains in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, between the 12th and 21st parallels north and along the 145th meridian east. They lie south-southeast of Japan, west-southwest of Hawaii, north of New Guinea, and east of the Philippines, demarcating the Philippine Sea&#x27;s eastern limit. They are found in the northern part of the western Oceanic sub-region of Micronesia, and are politically divided into two jurisdictions of the United States: the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and, at the southern end of the chain, the territory of Guam. The islands were named after the influential Spanish queen Mariana of Austria following their colonization in the 17th century.

The indigenous inhabitants are the Chamorro people. Archaeologists in 2013 reported findings which indicated that the people who first settled the Marianas arrived there after making what may have been at the time the longest uninterrupted ocean voyage in human history. They further reported findings which suggested that Tinian is likely to have been the first island in Oceania to have been settled by humans.

Spanish expeditions, beginning with one by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in the early 16th century, were the first Europeans to arrive; eventually, Spain annexed and colonized the archipelago, establishing their capital on the largest island, Guam. The Marianas were the first islands Magellan encountered after traversing the Pacific from the southern tip of South America. The fruits found there saved the survivors from scurvy, which had already killed dozens of crewmembers.

== Geography ==
The Mariana Islands are the southern part of a submerged mountain range that extends from Guam to near Japan. Geographically, the Marianas are part of a larger region called Micronesia, situated between 13° and 21°N latitude and 144° and 146°E longitude.

The Mariana Islands have a total land area of .
They are composed of two administrative units:
* Guam, a United States territory
* the Northern Mariana Islands (including the islands of Saipan, Tinian and Rota), which make up a Commonwealth of the United States.

The island chain geographically consists of two subgroups, a northern group of ten volcanic main islands, all are currently uninhabited; and a southern group of five coralline limestone islands (Rota, Guam, Aguijan, Tinian and Saipan), all inhabited except Aguijan. In the northern volcanic group a maximum elevation of about is reached; there are craters showing signs of activity, and earthquakes are not uncommon. Coral reefs fringe the coasts of the southern isles, which are of slight elevation.

The lowest point on the Earth&#x27;s crust, the Mariana Trench, is near the islands and is named after them.

The majority of islands in the Marianas still retain their indigenous names ending in the letters -an; for example, Guahan (the indigenous name of Guam), Agrigan, Agrihan, Aguihan/Aguigan, Pagan, Sarigan, Saipan, and Tinian.

== Geology ==
The islands are part of a geologic structure known as the Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc system, and range in age from 5 million years old in the north to 30 million years old in the south (Guam). The island chain arose as a result of the western edge of the Pacific Plate moving westward and plunging downward below the Mariana plate, a region which is the most volcanically active convergent plate boundary on Earth. This subduction region, just east of the island chain, forms the noted Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the Earth&#x27;s oceans and lowest part of the surface of the Earth&#x27;s crust. In this region, according to geologic theory, water trapped in the extensive faulting of the Pacific Plate as serpentinite, is heated by the higher temperatures of depth during its subduction, the pressure from the expanding steam results in the hydrothermal activity in the area and the volcanic activity which formed the Mariana Islands.

== Ecology ==

All the islands, except Farallon de Medinilla and Uracas or Farallon de Pajaros (in the northern group), are more or less densely forested, and the vegetation is dense, much resembling that of the Carolines and also of the Philippines, from where species of plants have been introduced. Owing to the moistness of the soil cryptogams are numerous, as are also most kinds of grasses. On most of the islands there is a plentiful supply of water.

The fauna of the Marianas, though inferior in number and variety, is similar in character to that of the Carolines and certain species are indigenous to both island groups. The climate though damp is healthy, while the heat, being tempered by the trade winds, is milder than that of the Philippines; the variations of temperature are not great.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===

The islands are part of a geologic structure known as the Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc system and range in age from 5 million years old in the north to 30 million years old in the south (Guam). The islands are formed as the highly dense and very old western edge of the Pacific Plate plunges downward to form the floor of the Mariana Trench and carries trapped water under the Mariana plate as it does so. This water is super-heated as the plate is carried farther downward and results in the volcanic activity which has formed the arc of Mariana Islands above this subduction region.
The Mariana Islands were the first islands settled by humans in Remote Oceania. Incidentally it is also the first and the longest of the ocean-crossing voyages of the Austronesian peoples into Remote Oceania, and is separate from the later Polynesian settlement of the rest of Remote Oceania. They were first settled around 1500 to 1400 BCE by migrants departing from the Philippines.

Archeological studies of human activity on the islands have revealed pottery with red-slipped, circle-stamped and punctate-stamped designs found in the Mariana Islands dating from between 1500 and 1400 BC. These artifacts show similar aesthetics to pottery found in Northern and Central Philippines, particularly Nagsabaran (Cagayan Valley) pottery, which flourished during the period between 2000 and 1300 BC.

Comparative and historical linguistics also indicate that the Chamorro language is most closely related to the Philippine subfamily of the Austronesian languages, instead of the Oceanic subfamily of the languages found in the rest of Remote Oceania.
Mitochondrial DNA and whole genome sequencing of the Chamorro people strongly support an ancestry from the Philippines. Genetic analysis of pre-&quot;Latte&quot; period skeletons in Guam also show that they do not have Australo-Melanesian (&quot;Papuan&quot;) ancestry, which rules out origins from the Bismarck Archipelago, New Guinea, and eastern Indonesia. The Lapita culture itself (the ancestral branch of the Polynesian migrations) is younger than the first settlement of the Marianas (the earliest Lapita artifacts are dated to around 1350 to 1300 BCE), indicating that they originated from separate migration voyages.

Nevertheless, DNA analyses also show close genetic relationships between ancient settlers of the Marianas and early Lapita settlers in the Bismarck Archipelago. This may indicate that both the Lapita culture and the Marianas were settled from direct migrations from the Philippines, or that early settlers from the Marianas voyaged further southwards into the Bismarcks and reconnected with the Lapita people.

The Marianas also later established contact with and received migrations from the Caroline Islands at around the first millennium CE. This brought new pottery styles, languages, genes, and the hybrid Polynesian breadfruit.

The period 900 to 1700 CE of the Marianas, immediately before and during the Spanish colonization, is known as the &quot;Latte&quot; period. It is characterized by rapid cultural change, most notably by the massive megalithic &quot;latte&quot; stones (also spelled &quot;latde&quot; or &quot;latti&quot;). These were composed of the &quot;haligi&quot; pillars capped with another stone called &quot;tasa&quot; (which prevented rodents from climbing the posts). These served as supports for the rest of the structure which was made of wood. Remains of structures made with similar wooden posts have also been found. Human graves have also been found in front of &quot;latte&quot; structures, The &quot;Latte&quot; period was also characterized by the introduction of rice agriculture, which is unique in the pre-contact Pacific Islands.

The reasons for these changes is still unclear, but it is believed that it may have resulted from a third wave of migrants from Island Southeast Asia. Comparisons with other architectural traditions makes it likely that this third migration wave were again from the Philippines, or from eastern Indonesia (either Sulawesi or Sumba), all of which have a tradition of raised buildings with capstones. The word &quot;haligi&quot; (&quot;pillar&quot;) is also used in various languages throughout the Philippines; while the Chamorro word &quot;guma&quot; (&quot;house&quot;) closely resembles the Sumba word &quot;uma&quot;.

=== Spanish exploration and control ===
The first Europeans to see the island group were a Spanish expedition, who on March 6, 1521, observed a string of islands and sailed between two of them during a Spanish expedition of world circumnavigation under the command of Ferdinand Magellan. Historically, the southern village of Umatac, Guam has been credited as the site of the Spanish landing. As confirmation, a scholarly study of the navigator&#x27;s diary, now kept in preservation in the Philippines, revealed a drawing of the islands with a tiny island to the south of a much larger island above it. The described placement of the islands confirms that Magellan had actually sailed between Guam and Cocos Island, and not Guam and Rota, as some originally thought, especially since the northern areas of Guam do not have safe coves or harbors to anchor. Moreover, the waters of Northern Guam are often rougher and the currents are even more treacherous in comparison to the safer coves and currents seen by the southwestern side of Guam.

Regardless of where they landed, the Spanish ships arrived in Guam and were unable to get fresh food as the inhabitants, Chamorros, &quot;entered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on&quot;, including &quot;the small boat that was fastened to the poop of the flagship&quot;, according to Spanish crewman Antonio Pigafetta. The Spanish crew, in retaliation, attacked the Chamorros and dubbed the islands Islas de los Ladrones (Islands of the Thieves). Wrote Pigafetta, &quot;Those people are poor, but ingenious and very thievish, on account of which we called those three islands the islands of Ladrones.&quot; Pigafetta writes,

And the captain-general wished to approach the largest of these three islands to replenish his provisions. But it was not possible, for the people of those islands entered the ships and robbed us so that we could not protect ourselves from them. And when we wished to strike and take in the sails so as to land, they stole very quickly the small boat called a skiff which was fastened to the poop of the captain&#x27;s ship. At which he, being very angry, went ashore with forty armed men. And burning some forty or fifty houses with several boats and killing seven men of the said island, they recovered their skiff.

Pigafetta also described the boats the inhabitants used, including the sail shaped like a &quot;lateen sail&quot; (actually the crab claw sail), hence the name Islas de las Velas Latinas (Islands of the Lateen Sails), the name used as Magellan claimed them for the Spanish crown. San Lazarus archipelago, Jardines (&#x27;gardens&#x27;) and Prazeres are among the names applied to them by later navigators.

In 1667, Spain formally claimed them, established a regular colony there and in 1668 gave the islands the official title of &quot;Las Marianas&quot;, in honor of Spanish Queen Mariana of Austria, widow of King Philip IV of Spain and Queen Regent of the Spanish Empire ruling during the minority of her son King Charles II. They then had a population of more than 50,000 inhabitants. With the arrival of passengers and settlers aboard the Manila Galleons from the Americas, new diseases were introduced in the islands, which caused many deaths in the native Chamorro population. The native population, who referred to themselves as &quot;Taotao Tano&quot; (people of the land) but were known to the early Spanish colonists as &quot;Chamurres&quot; or &quot;HachaMori&quot;, eventually died out as a distinct people, though their descendants intermarried. At the Spanish occupation in 1668, the Chamorros were estimated at 50,000, but a century later only 1,800 natives remained, as the majority of the population was of mixed Spanish-Chamorro blood or mestizo. They were characteristic Micronesians, with a considerable civilization. On the island of Tinian are some remains attributed to them, consisting of two rows of massive square stone columns, about broad and high, with heavy, round capitals called latte stones. According to early Spanish accounts cinerary urns were found embedded in the capitals. 
When Spanish settlement started on 14 June 1668, they were subordinate to the Mexican colony (soon viceroyalty) of New Spain, until 1817, when they became subordinated to the Philippines, as part of the Spanish East Indies.

Research in the archipelago was carried out by Commodore Anson, who in August 1742 landed upon the island of Tinian. The Ladrones were visited by Byron in 1765, Wallis in 1767 and in 1772.

The Marianas and specifically the island of Guam were a stopover for Spanish galleons en route from Acapulco, Mexico to Manila, Philippines in a convoy known as the Galeon de Manila. Following the 1872 Cavite mutiny, several Filipinos were exiled to Guam, including the father of Pedro Paterno, Maximo Paterno, Dr. Antonio M. Regidor y Jurado and Jose Maria Basa.

The islands were a popular port of call for British and American whaling ships in the 19th century. The first such visit on record was that of the &quot; Resource&quot; to Guam in October 1799. The last known visit was made by the American whaler &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; in February 1904.

=== Loss from Spain and split in governance ===
The Marianas remained a Spanish colony under the general government of the Philippines until 1898, when, as a result of its loss in the Spanish–American War, Spain ceded Guam to the United States. Guam has been separate from the Northern Marianas since this time. Following the Philippine–American War, Apolinario Mabini and other Filipino leaders were exiled to Guam in 1901.

Weakened from its defeat in the Spanish–American War, Spain could no longer effectively control and protect the nearly 6,000 islands it retained throughout Micronesia, including the Northern Marianas, Carolines and Pelew Islands. Therefore, Spain entered into the German-Spanish Treaty of February 12, 1899 to sell the Northern Marianas and its other remaining islands to Germany for 837,500 German gold marks (about US$4,100,000 at the time). The Northern Marianas and other island groups were incorporated by Germany as a small part of the larger German Protectorate of New Guinea. The total population in the Northern Marianas portion of these islands was only 2,646 inhabitants around this time, with the ten most northerly islands being actively volcanic and thus mostly uninhabited.

Japan, allied with the Entente Powers during World War I, seized all of Germany&#x27;s colonial possessions in East Asia and Micronesia, including the Northern Mariana Islands, and held them through the end of the war. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, Germany was stripped of all her colonies worldwide, including the Palau, Caroline, Northern Mariana and Marshall Islands. By international agreement, these were all placed into trusteeship under the management of League of Nations which assigned them to Japan as the Class C South Seas Mandate. During this time, Japan used some of the islands for sugarcane production, modestly increasing the population of a few of the islands.

=== World War II ===
The island chain saw significant fighting during World War II. Guam, a possession of the United States since 1898, was captured by Japan in an attack from the Northern Mariana Islands that began on the day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 8, 1941, the same time as the Pearl Harbor attack across the International Date Line). In 1944, the United States captured the Mariana Islands chain from Japan: the Northern Mariana Islands were desired by the U.S. as bombing bases to reach the Japanese mainland, with the invasion of Saipan being launched for that reason in June before the U.S. even moved to recapture Guam; a month later the U.S. recaptured Guam and captured Tinian. Once captured, Saipan and Tinian&#x27;s islands were used extensively by the United States military as they finally put mainland Japan within a round-trip range of American B-29 bombers. In response, Japanese forces attacked the bases on Saipan and Tinian from November 1944 to February 1945. At the same time and afterwards, the United States Army Air Forces based on these islands conducted an intense strategic bombing campaign against the Japanese cities of military and industrial importance, including Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, and others. Both US bombers the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; and the &quot;Bockscar&quot; (which dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively) flew their missions from Tinian&#x27;s North Field.

According to Werner Gruhl: &quot;Mariana Island historians estimate that 10 percent of Guam&#x27;s approximately 20,000 population were killed by violence, most by the Japanese Imperial Army and Navy.&quot;

=== Post-World War II ===

The direct result of World War II on the Mariana Islands was that, after the war, the Northern Mariana Islands came under the control of the United States in the same way they had earlier come under the control of Japan after World War I. However, this time they became part of the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) established pursuant to Security Council Resolution 21. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands later became a U.S. territory following its exit from the TTPI pursuant to Security Council Resolution 683. Although now both under U.S. control, the Northern Mariana Islands are separate from Guam. Efforts at reunification have failed in part due to residual post-war tensions resulting from the very different histories of Guam (occupied by Japan for only 31 months, in wartime) and the Northern Mariana Islands (more peacefully occupied by Japan, for about 30 years).

In addition, the Esmeralda Bank, Ruby Seamount, and Supply Reef are submarine landforms in the Mariana archipelago.

== Tourism ==

Tourism in the Northern Marianas is split mainly between Filipino, Japanese, American, Korean, Taiwanese and Chinese tourists. There are several large tour operators in Saipan that cater to Asian tourists coming to the island. By far, the majority of tourism in the Marianas is in Guam. Several flights a day land in Guam, mostly in the early hours between 1:00 AM and 3:30 AM. With the close of the garment industries in the Northern Marianas, tourism has grown slowly and is now a major part of the economy, As it has grown the economy over the 21th century, Most tourism is around the isles and volcanos. 

== Cuisine ==
Common dishes in the Mariana Islands include red rice, meat or poultry on the grill or in coconut milk, chicken &quot;kelaguen&quot;, &quot;apigigi&quot; (young coconut with cassava paste wrapped in banana leaf), and tropical fruits.

<text>The Spring River is a long river which flows through the U.S. states of Missouri and Arkansas. It consists of two branches, the South Fork of the Spring River and the Spring River proper. The South Fork of the Spring River starts in Howell County, Missouri and flows south through Fulton and Sharp counties in Arkansas. The South Fork of the Spring River joins the Spring River proper near the town of Hardy, Arkansas. The South Fork is a quiet stream with gravelly bars that are ideal for camping.

The Spring River proper begins where Mammoth Spring and Warm Fork of the Spring River merge at Mammoth Spring State Park in Mammoth Spring, Arkansas. Mammoth Spring is the outlet of an underground river that runs from Missouri into Arkansas. Over per hour flow out of the massive spring and forms the Spring River. Being predominantly spring fed with water averaging 58 °F (14 °C), the river is kept cool during warmer months and is suitable trout habitate for several miles.

The Spring River proper is a popular destination for tourists, canoers, and for riding inner tubes (&quot;toobers&quot;). The most popular stretch of the river is between Mammoth Spring and the tourist town of Hardy. Below Hardy, the Spring River flows past Ravenden and Imoden to its confluence with the Eleven Point River near Old Davidsonville State Park. The Spring River joins the Black River near Black Rock, Arkansas. There are a variety of outfitters along the river who provide supplies, canoe rental, and shuttle services in the area between Mammoth Spring and Hardy. Several resorts provide lodging for tourists.

The Spring River has a diverse population of fish including trout, walleye, largemouth and smallmouth bass, channel catfish, redear sunfish, and tiger muskies. A state record tiger muskie weighing 23 lb 12 oz (10.8 kg) was caught in the river in 1995. The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission maintains a trout hatchery on the river and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service operates another on the river near Mammoth Spring.

==Flooding==

In March 2008, a vigorous, slow moving low pressure system moved out of Texas and into Arkansas inundating the area with over a foot of rain falling in some areas of Arkansas and Missouri. Heavy rainfall rates caused the river to over flow its banks with an observed maximum depth of . This river level had only been surpassed by the record 1982 floods that reached a level of 29 feet. The mayor of Hardy ordered evacuation of 250 citizens of the town because of dangerous river levels that flooded over 100 buildings in and around the Spring River.

<doc id="329752" wikidata="Q99438637" url="?curid=329752" title="Seaman recruit">
<text>Seaman recruit is usually the lowest rank used in navies around the world.

==United States==

Seaman recruit (SR) is the lowest enlisted rate in the United States Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps just below seaman apprentice; this rank was formerly known as seaman third class. Two separate pay grades exist within this rank (and the corresponding ranks in the other branches of the United States military structure) — one for those with service of less than four months, with a higher pay scale for those in service for more than four months, even if they have not yet advanced to seaman apprentice.

===History===
Navy seaman recruits do not bear any uniform rank insignia currently. Prior to 1996, a diagonal stripe—the same as the U.S. Coast Guard—was used.

While all E-1s in the Coast Guard are called seaman recruits regardless of their assignment, the actual title for an E-1 in the U.S. Navy varies based on the community to which the sailor belongs:

* Navy E-1s in the general deck and administrative community are seaman recruits.
* Navy E-1 hospital corpsmen are hospitalman recruits. This is the only rating in this community.
* Fireman recruits are Navy E-1s in the engineering and hull community.
* Navy E-1s in the aviation community are called airman recruits.
* Navy Seabees are called constructionman recruits. 

In October 2005, the dental technician rating was merged with the hospital corpsman rating, eliminating the dentalman recruit title. E-1s who held the rank of dentalman recruit at the transition became hospitalman recruits.

Sailors who have completed the requirements to be assigned a rating and have been accepted by the Bureau of Naval Personnel as holding that rating (a process called &quot;striking&quot;) are called designated strikers and are called by their full rate and rating in formal communications (e.g., &quot;machinist&#x27;s mate fireman recruit&quot;, as opposed to simply &quot;fireman recruit&quot;), though the rating is often left off in informal communication. Those who have not officially been assigned to a rating are officially referred to as &quot;undesignated&quot; or &quot;non-rates&quot;.

<doc id="329756" wikidata="Q934430" url="?curid=329756" title="The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)">
<text>The Postman Always Rings Twice is a 1934 crime novel by American writer James M. Cain. The novel was successful and notorious upon publication. It is considered one of the most outstanding crime novels of the 20th century. The novel&#x27;s mix of sexuality and violence was startling in its time and caused it to be banned in Boston.

It is included in Modern Library&#x27;s list of 100 best novels, and it was published as an Armed Services Edition during WWII. The novel has been adapted for film seven times, of which the 1946 version is regarded as an important film noir.

The story owes a clear debt to Émile Zola&#x27;s 1868 novel &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot;, which has a similar plot.

==Plot==
The story is narrated in the first person by Frank Chambers, a young drifter who stops at a rural California diner for a meal and ends up working there. The diner is operated by a beautiful young woman, Cora, and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, sometimes called &quot;the Greek&quot;.

Frank and Cora feel an immediate attraction to each other and begin a passionate affair with sadomasochistic qualities. Cora is tired of her situation, married to a man she does not love and working at a diner that she wants to own and improve. She and Frank scheme to murder Nick in order to start a new life together without Cora losing the diner.

The pair plan on striking Nick&#x27;s head and making it seem as if he fell and drowned in the bathtub. Cora fells Nick with a solid blow, but a sudden power outage and the appearance of a policeman make the scheme fail. Nick recovers and, because of retrograde amnesia, does not suspect that he narrowly avoided being killed.

Determined to kill Nick, Frank and Cora fake a car accident. They ply Nick with wine, strike him on the head and crash the car. Frank is also gravely injured in the crash, while Cora simulates minor injuries and bruises. The local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it. As a tactic intended to get Cora and Frank to turn on each other, he charges only Cora with Nick&#x27;s murder, coercing Frank to sign a complaint against her.

Cora, furious and indignant, insists on offering a full confession detailing both their roles. Her lawyer tricks her into dictating that confession to a member of his own staff. Cora, believing her confession made, returns to prison. Though she would be sure to learn of the trickery, a few valuable hours are gained. The lawyer uses the time to manipulate the insurance companies financially interested in the trial to have their private detective recant his testimony, which was the final remaining weapon in the prosecution&#x27;s arsenal. The state is forced to grant Cora a plea agreement under which she is given a suspended sentence and no jail time.

After the trial, Cora&#x27;s diner begins to boom, but her relationship with Frank worsens. While Cora is attending her mother&#x27;s funeral, Frank has an affair with a wild cat tamer. Upon returning home, Cora tells him that she is pregnant. She is also angered when she finds out about his affair.

Frank and Cora eventually reconcile, get married and plan a happy future and a family. Then Cora is killed in a car crash while Frank is driving. The book ends with Frank, from death row, summarizing the events that followed, explaining that he was wrongly convicted of murdering Cora. The text, he hopes, will be published after his execution.

==Publication history==

After failing as a scriptwriter for Paramount and Columbia studios in 1932, Cain resumed his efforts to write a longer work of fiction. His short story &quot;The Baby in the Icebox&quot; had impressed Alfred A. Knopf publishers, and with their encouragement and that of playwright Vincent Lawrence, Cain began to write a novel in March 1933. Completed in September, the manuscript was initially turned down by both Knopf and Macmillan. Walter Lippmann, who Cain had served under as a journalist at the &quot;New York World&quot;, interceded on his behalf and convinced Alfred Knopf to acquire the story. Originally titled &quot;Bar-B-Que&quot;, the work appeared as &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; in early 1934. Publisher Knopf detested both the originally proposed title &quot;Bar-B-Que&quot;, as well as &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;. A compromise title &quot;For Love or Money&quot; was proposed by Knopf. Cain and Lawrence insisted that the metaphor of a mail carrier as the agent of fate was essential and prevailed in the title dispute. [See below: Origins of the title].

==Critical response==

In 1934, the 42-year-old Cain was a successful journalist, known primarily for his satiric dialogues and sketches published in &quot;The American Mercury&quot; and as a human interest columnist for &quot;New York World&quot;, &quot;The American Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;.
With the publication of &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;, Cain was instantly hailed as the foremost American writer in the hard-boiled genre. An &quot;ecstatic&quot; review by Franklin P. Adams in the &quot;New York Herald&quot; served to alert critics to Cain&#x27;s achievement. The novel elicited high praise from literary critics in the US and abroad, and proved to be a perennial best-seller: &quot;When the book appeared it caused a sensation.&quot; Cain was appalled when his work was described as the &quot;quintessence&quot; of the &quot;hard-boiled&quot; genre and the author labeled the preeminent &quot;tough-guy&quot; writer. He emphatically rejected these characterizations of his writing.

The arresting first sentence of the novel begins &quot;They threw me off the haytruck about noon...&quot; and was widely remarked upon. The early passages of the novel have been cited in journals and studied in college writing courses since the novel appeared. Biographer David Madden notes that the opening passages showcase Cain&#x27;s narrative skill: &quot;The compression, the swift execution of the basic situation [in the first pages] are typical of the entire novel.&quot; Cain&#x27;s virtues as a novelist have not been uniformly lauded. Biographer Paul Skenazy noted that the Postman suffered from &quot;simplistic psychological portraits, some mannered writing [and] inconsistencies in the time frame and plot structures...&quot;. Critic Walter Wells in his analysis of Hollywood fiction argued that the &quot;Postman remains a forced, structurally imperfect work [pandering] shamelessly to subliterary taste.&quot;
Literary critic Edmund Wilson cautioned that the story is &quot;always in danger of becoming unintentionally funny.&quot; Biographer Roy Hoopes noted that &quot;After reading…Cain&#x27;s light fiction, you cannot help but wonder whether the comic scenes in 
&quot;Postman&quot; were really unintentional.&quot; The fame of &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; prompted parodies: humorist James Thurber, who had worked with Cain at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in the early 1930s, offered a burlesque of the first sentence of the novel which opens: &quot;They kicked me out of college when I was about twenty-seven…&quot;

Hoopes regards &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; as &quot;that rarest of literary achievements—a best-seller widely acclaimed by the critics.&quot;

==Plot and theme origins==

Two sources informed Cain&#x27;s plot inventions for &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;. In California during the early 1930s, he frequented a gas station operated by a buxom woman who pumped his gas. Cain described his encounters with her:

Cain discovered the dramatic component he required for the story in the details of the 1927 Ruth Snyder-Judd Gray case, in which a wife murdered her husband in collusion with her lover, the prototypes for his characters Cora Papadakis and Frank Chambers in &quot;Postman&quot;. Biographer Paul Skenazy suggests that Cain was intrigued not only by their adultery and murder, but the subsequent betrayals that sent Snyder and Gray into &quot;a self-destructive spiral.&quot;

===Origins of title===

The meaning of the title has been the subject of much speculation. William Marling, for instance, suggested that Cain may have taken the title from the sensational 1927 case of Ruth Snyder, who, like Cora in &quot;Postman&quot;, had conspired with her lover to murder her husband. Cain used the Snyder case as an inspiration for his 1943 novel &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;; Marling believed it was also a model for the plot and the title of &quot;Postman&quot;. In the real-life case, Snyder said she had prevented her husband from discovering the changes she had made to his life insurance policy by telling the postman to deliver the policy&#x27;s payment notices only to her and instructing him to ring the doorbell twice as a signal indicating he had such a delivery for her.

The historian Judith Flanders, however, has interpreted the title as a reference to postal customs in the Victorian era. When mail (post) was delivered, the postman knocked once to let the household know it was there: no reply was needed. When there was a telegram, however, which had to be handed over personally, he knocked twice so that the household would know to answer the door. Telegrams were expensive and usually the bringers of bad news: so a postman knocking (later, ringing) twice signaled trouble was on the way.

In the preface to &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, Cain wrote that the title of &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; came from a discussion he had with the screenwriter Vincent Lawrence.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.loc/how-postman-name&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cain, Lawrence spoke of the anxiety he felt when waiting for the postman to bring him news on a submitted manuscript, noting that he would know when the postman had finally arrived because he always rang twice. In his biography of Cain, Roy Hoopes recounted the conversation between Cain and Lawrence, noting that Lawrence did not say merely that the postman always rang twice but also that he was sometimes so anxious waiting for the postman that he would go into his backyard to avoid hearing his ring. The tactic inevitably failed, Lawrence continued, because if the postman&#x27;s first ring was not noticed, his second one, even from the backyard, would be.

As a result of the conversation, Cain decided upon that phrase as a title for his novel. Upon discussing it further, the two men agreed such a phrase was metaphorically suited to Frank&#x27;s situation at the end of the novel. With the &quot;postman&quot; being God or fate, the &quot;delivery&quot; meant for Frank was his own death as just retribution for murdering Nick. Frank had missed the first &quot;ring&quot; when he initially got away with that killing. However, the postman rang again and this time the ring was heard; Frank is wrongly convicted of having murdered Cora and then sentenced to die. The theme of an inescapable fate is further underscored by the Greek&#x27;s escape from death in the lovers&#x27; first murder attempt, only to be done in by their second one.

<text>The Cooloola monster (Cooloola propator) is a large burrowing orthopteran of the family Cooloolidae, a family erected to accommodate it because it is so dissimilar to other ensiferans. It was discovered in 1980 in the Great Sandy National Park in Queensland, Australia, by David C. Rentz. Further members of the genus &quot;Cooloola&quot; were later discovered at other locations in Queensland.

==Description==
The Cooloola monster is a robust subterranean insect, characterised by very short antennae with ten bead-like segments. This contrasts with other members of the suborder Ensifera which have thirty or more segments. The sexes are different, the male being brownish and well-sclerotized (armoured), while the female has a relatively soft exoskeleton and is usually whitish in colour, as are the juveniles. Males have short wings and fully functional eyes, while females have no wings and their eyes have a flat cornea and few facets. The mouthparts are also unusual for ensiferans, having a knife-shaped lacinia (tip of the maxilla) and small elongated mandibles. These mouthparts suggest that the insect is predatory. In the related species &quot;Cooloola ziljan&quot;, the lacinia has been observed in use as a digging tool. The legs are adapted for burrowing and the hind legs bear flattened spines for this purpose. The fore and mid-legs are about the same length and the hind-legs rather larger. The shape of the femur and the degree of spination of the tibia differ between males and females. The tarsus is elongate and dorso-ventrally flattened in males, and shorter and less flattened in females. The male has a slender abdomen but the female&#x27;s abdomen is bulbous with a very short ovipositor.

==Behaviour==
Very little is known of the natural history of this insect. The male is sometimes seen on the surface at night but the female seems to remain permanently underground. The insects live in sandy soil near streams under Australian sheoak trees and are occasionally found hiding under stones or logs.

<doc id="329758" wikidata="Q4344" url="?curid=329758" title="Arnaut Daniel">
<text>Arnaut Daniel (; fl. 1180–1200) was an Occitan troubadour of the 12th century, praised by Dante as &quot;the best smith&quot; (&quot;miglior fabbro&quot;) and called a &quot;grand master of love&quot; (&quot;gran maestro d&#x27;amore&quot;) by Petrarch. In the 20th century he was lauded by Ezra Pound in &quot;The Spirit of Romance&quot; (1910) as the greatest poet to have ever lived. 

==Life==
According to one biography, Daniel was born of a noble family at the castle of Ribérac in Périgord; however, the scant contemporary sources point to him being a jester with pernicious economic troubles: Raimon de Durfort calls him &quot;a student, ruined by dice and shut-the-box&quot;.

==Work and style==
The dominant characteristic of Daniel&#x27;s poetry is an extreme obscurity of thought and expression, a style called &quot;trobar clus&quot; (&#x27;hermetic verse&#x27;). He belonged to one school of troubadour poets that sought to make their meanings difficult to understand through the use of unfamiliar words and expressions, enigmatical allusions, complicated meters and uncommon rhyme schemes. Daniel further invented a form of stanza in which no lines rhymed with each other, finding their rhymes only in the corresponding line of the next stanza.

Daniel was the inventor of the sestina, a song of six stanzas of six lines each, with the same end words repeated in every stanza, though arranged in a different and intricate order. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow claims he was also the author of the metrical romance of &quot;Lancillotto&quot;, or &quot;Launcelot of the Lake&quot;, but this claim is completely unsubstantiated; Dante&#x27;s reference to Daniel as the author of &quot;prose di romanzi&quot; (&quot;proses of romance&quot;) remains, therefore, a mystery. There are sixteen extant lyrics of Arnaut Daniel only one of which can be accurately dated, to 1181. Of the sixteen there is music for at least one of them, but it was composed at least a century after the poet&#x27;s death by an anonymous author. No original melody has survived.

==Legacy==
Daniel&#x27;s attempt to avoid simple and commonplace expressions in favor of striving for newer and more subtle effects found an admirer in Dante who would imitate the sestina&#x27;s form in more than one song. Petrarch also wrote several sestinas as the form later gained popularity with Italian poets. 

In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Arnaut Daniel appears as a character doing penance in Purgatory for lust. He responds in Old Occitan to the narrator&#x27;s question about who he is:
:Tan m&#x27;abellis vostre cortes deman,
:qu&#x27;ieu no me puesc ni voill a vos cobrire.
:Ieu sui Arnaut, que plor e vau cantan;
:consiros vei la passada folor,
:e vei jausen lo joi qu&#x27;esper, denan.
:Ara vos prec, per aquella valor
:que vos guida al som de l&#x27;escalina,
:sovenha vos a temps de ma dolor.
::(Purg., XXVI, 140–147)

Translation:
:&quot;Your courteous question pleases me so,
:that I cannot and will not hide from you.
:I am Arnaut, who weeping and singing go;
:Contrite I see the folly of the past,
:And, joyous, I foresee the joy I hope for one day.
:Therefore do I implore you, by that power
:Which guides you to the summit of the stairs,
:Remember my suffering, in the right time.&quot;

It is not believed that it is a coincidence that Dante wrote about Daniel in eight lines, as that was the favored amount of lines per stanza that the troubadours preferred to write. Dante also replicated that style and stanza length in six out of the eleven Occitan poems that Dante references in his &quot;De Vulgari Eloquentia.&quot;

Throughout the entirety of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante upholds the ideas of Italian superiority extending from the Roman Empire into that of &quot;modern&quot; language. This is displayed in his writing of Arnaut Daniel in Occitan thus, in one commentator&#x27;s opinion, mocking the closed and difficult style of troubadour poetry (&quot;trobar clus&quot;), compared to the open sweetness of Italian poetry.

In homage to these lines which Dante gave to Daniel, the European edition of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s second volume of poetry was titled &quot;Ara Vos Prec&quot;. In addition, Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; opens and closes with references to Dante and Daniel. &quot;The Waste Land&quot; is dedicated to Pound as &quot;il miglior fabbro&quot; which is what Dante had called Daniel. The poem also contains a reference to Canto XXVI in its line &quot;Poi s&#x27;ascose nel foco che gli affina&quot; (&quot;Then he hid in the fire that purifies them&quot;) which appears in Eliot&#x27;s closing section of &quot;The Waste Land&quot; as it does to end Dante&#x27;s canto.

Arnaut&#x27;s 4th canto contains the lines that Pound claimed were &quot;the three lines by which Daniel is most commonly known&quot; (The Spirit of Romance, p. 36):

:&quot;leu sui Arnaut qu&#x27;amas l&#x27;aura
:E chatz le lebre ab lo bou
:E nadi contra suberna&quot;

Translation:
:&quot;I am Arnaut who gathers up the wind,
:And chases the hare with the ox,
:And swims against the torrent.&quot;

<doc id="329759" wikidata="Q2304073" url="?curid=329759" title="Manned Maneuvering Unit">
<text>The Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) is an astronaut propulsion unit that was used by NASA on three Space Shuttle missions in 1984. The MMU allowed the astronauts to perform untethered extravehicular spacewalks at a distance from the shuttle. The MMU was used in practice to retrieve a pair of faulty communications satellites, Westar VI and Palapa B2. Following the third mission the unit was retired from use. A smaller successor, the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER), was first flown in 1994, and is intended for emergency use only.

==Overview==
The unit featured redundancy to protect against failure of individual systems. It was designed to fit over the life-support system backpack of the Space Shuttle Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). When carried into space, the MMU was stowed in a support station attached to the wall of the payload bay near the airlock hatch. Two MMUs were carried on a mission, with the second unit mounted across from the first on the opposite payload bay wall. The MMU controller arms were folded for storage. When an astronaut backed into the unit and snapped the life-support system into place, the arms were unfolded.

To adapt to astronauts with different arm lengths, controller arms could be adjusted over a range of approximately 13 centimetres. The MMU was small enough to be maneuvered with ease around and within complex structures. With a full propellant load, its mass was 148 kilograms (326 pounds).

Gaseous nitrogen was used as the propellant for the MMU. Two aluminium tanks with Kevlar wrappings contained 5.9 kilograms of nitrogen each, enough propellant for a six-hour Extravehicular activity (EVA) depending on the amount of maneuvering done. The two propellent tanks had an initial charge on the ground prior to the mission allowing for Delta-v of 110 to 130 ft/sec. The tanks could be recharged in orbit to a minimum equivalent Delta-v of 72 ft/sec. For a nominal mass, translational acceleration was 0.3±0.05 ft/sec2 and rotational acceleration was 10.0±3.0 deg/sec2.

There were 24 nozzle thrusters placed at different locations on the MMU. To operate the propulsion system, the astronaut used their fingertips to manipulate hand controllers at the ends of the MMU&#x27;s two arms. The right controller produced rotational acceleration for roll, pitch, and yaw. The left controller produced translational acceleration for moving forward-back, up-down, and left-right. Coordination of the two controllers produced intricate movements in the unit. Once a desired orientation was achieved, the astronaut could engage an automatic attitude-hold function that maintained the inertial attitude of the unit in flight. This freed both hands for work.

==History==

In 1966, the US Air Force developed an Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), a self-contained rocket pack very similar to the MMU. This was planned to be tested during Project Gemini on an EVA by Eugene Cernan on Gemini 9A on June 5, 1966. However, the test had to be cancelled because Cernan, tired and overheated, sweated so profusely that his helmet visor fogged before he could get to the AMU mounted on the back of the spacecraft. Astronauts did not learn how to work during EVA without tiring until the final Gemini 12 mission, but no AMU was carried on that flight. Since there was no real need for self-contained astronaut EVA flight in the Apollo and Skylab programs, the idea had to wait for the advent of the Space Shuttle program, though several maneuvering device designs were tested inside Skylab.

===Active use in space===

The MMU was used on three Shuttle missions in 1984. It was first tested on February 7 during mission STS-41-B by astronauts Bruce McCandless II and Robert L. Stewart. Two months later, during mission STS-41-C, astronauts James van Hoften and George Nelson attempted to use the MMU to capture the Solar Maximum Mission satellite and to bring it into the orbiter&#x27;s payload bay for repairs and servicing. The plan was to use an astronaut-piloted MMU to grapple the SMM with the Trunion Pin Attachment Device (TPAD) mounted between the hand controllers of the MMU, null its rotation rates, and allow the Shuttle to bring it into the Shuttle&#x27;s payload bay for stowage. Three attempts to grapple the satellite using the TPAD failed. The TPAD jaws could not lock onto Solar Max because of an obstructing grommet on the satellite not included in the blueprints for the satellite. This led to an improvised plan which nearly ended the satellite&#x27;s mission. The improvisation had the MMU astronaut use his hands to grab hold of an SMM solar array and null the rates by a push from MMU&#x27;s thrusters. Instead, this attempt induced higher rates and in multiple axes; the satellite was tumbling out of control and quickly losing battery life. SMM Operations Control Center engineers shut down all non-essential SMM subsystems and with a bit of luck were able to recover the SMM minutes before total failure. The ground support engineers then stabilized the satellite and nulled its rotation rates for capture with the orbiter&#x27;s robotic arm, the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS). This proved to be a much better plan. Their successful work increased the lifespan of the satellite.

The final MMU mission was STS-51-A, which flew in November 1984. The propulsion unit was used to retrieve two communication satellites, Westar VI and Palapa B2, that did not reach their proper orbits because of faulty propulsion modules. Astronauts Joseph P. Allen and Dale Gardner captured the two satellites and brought them into the Orbiter payload bay for stowage and return to Earth.
===Retirement===

After a safety review following the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, the MMU was judged too risky for further use and it was found many activities planned for the MMU could be done effectively with manipulator arms or traditional tethered EVAs. NASA also discontinued using the Shuttle for commercial satellite contracts, and the military discontinued the use of the Shuttle, eliminating the main potential uses. Although the MMU was envisioned as a natural aid for constructing the International Space Station, with its retirement, NASA developed different tethered spacewalk approaches.

The two operational, flown flight units MMU No. 2 and No. 3 were stored by NASA in a clean room at Lockheed Martin in Denver through 1998. NASA transferred flight article No. 3 to the National Air and Space Museum in 1998, which now hangs suspended in the hall above Space Shuttle Discovery in the Udvar-Hazy Center annex. Flight article No. 2 is on display at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama. As of 2017, MMU No. 1 is on display in the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility at Johnson Space Center.

<doc id="329760" wikidata="Q7894124" url="?curid=329760" title="Universal dialectic">
<text>Universal dialectic is an ontological idea which is closely related to the Taoist and Neo-Confucian concept of taiji or &quot;supreme ultimate.&quot; In the West, dialecticians including Hegel explored themes that some see as remarkably similar, laying the groundwork for unification. Universal dialectic is envisioned as a single fundamental creative principle of inherent complementarity, as inspired by Heraclitus. However, rather than manifesting only cyclical change (as was the Greek view), it is progressive in nature, bringing about states of increasing complexity through a dialectical process of synthesis.

Accordingly, the term &quot;universal dialectic&quot; can be seen as part of an attempt to Westernize and/or modernize the concept of &quot;taiji&quot; in regard to the fundamental role and nature of complementary opposites in the ongoing self-organizing process of creation. It associates this traditionally Eastern view with the concept of dialectic advocated by Socrates, Hegel, and Marx. This Western influence adds a progressive element to the inexorable process of change, a concept which is absent in Oriental thought.

Jean-Paul Sartre may also be considered to have developed his thought in this direction if one considers the framework that his biographers used, that of the three stages of liberty, equality and fraternity. Sartre&#x27;s writing was inherently dialectical but evolving towards the universal.

<text>Urban renewal (also called urban regeneration in the United Kingdom and urban redevelopment in the United States) is a program of land redevelopment often used to address urban decay in cities. Urban renewal involves the clearing out of blighted areas in inner cities in favour of new housing, businesses, and other developments.

==Historical origins==
The concept of urban renewal as a method for social reform emerged in England as a reaction to the increasingly cramped and unsanitary conditions of the urban poor in the rapidly industrializing cities of the 19th century. The agenda that emerged was a progressive doctrine that assumed better housing conditions would reform its residents morally and economically. Modern attempts at renewal began in the late 19th century in developed nations. However, urban reform imposed by the state for reasons of aesthetics and efficiency had already begun in 1853, with Haussmann&#x27;s renovation of Paris ordered by Napoleon III.

Modern urban renewal experienced an intense phase in the late 1940s under the rubric of reconstruction. In the context of urban renewal, &quot;reconstruction&quot; typically refers to efforts to rebuild and revitalize cities that were damaged during World War II. This phase involved not just repairing buildings, but also rethinking urban design, infrastructure, and housing policies.

The impact of these initiatives was significant: cities were often reshaped with new zoning laws, transportation systems, and public housing projects. These changes aimed to accommodate growing populations and improve living conditions, but they also often led to displacement of communities and altered demographics.

==Modern urban renewal==
In the late 20th century and now in the 21st century, urban renewal initiatives have often pursued three key goals: economic revitalization, social or cultural regeneration, and environmental sustainability. These efforts frequently aim to transform underutilized urban areas into hubs of economic and cultural activity, leveraging policies that promote both sustainability and equitable development. For example, green infrastructure projects, such as urban parks and community gardens, not only enhance property values but also foster social cohesion and provide environmental benefits like improved water management and biodiversity conservation.

In recent years, urban renewal programs have increasingly involved &quot;culturepreneurs,&quot; individuals or organizations that blend cultural and economic strategies to reimagine urban spaces. These stakeholders often collaborate with governments and private entities to redevelop vacant land into dynamic public spaces, such as pop-up cultural venues or urban beaches. Culturepreneur initiatives are designed to bridge the gap between the needs of urban residents, local authorities, and property developers, fostering innovative, community-driven solutions.

Moreover, urban renewal projects have drawn attention to the nuanced impacts of gentrification. While these efforts can bring economic and infrastructural improvements, they may also displace long-standing communities and erode cultural heritage. Addressing these challenges requires a deliberate focus on equitable development strategies, as demonstrated by initiatives like the ReGenesis Project in South Carolina, which combines environmental cleanup with community-driven planning.

===Goals===
Urban renewal evolved into a policy based less on destruction and more on renovation and investment, and today is an integral part of many local governments. A primary purpose of urban renewal is to restore economic viability to a given area by attracting external private and public investment and by encouraging business start-ups and survival.

The goals of urban renewal are:

* Tackling barriers to economic growth
* Decreasing the level of unemployment
* Increasing the level of attractiveness for both local residents and investors
* Increasing residents satisfaction in where they live
* Creating opportunities for deprived communities
* Unlocking potential in deprived areas

== Strategies ==

===Slum clearance===

Slum clearances are strategy to demolish low-income poor-quality settlements and use the land for another type of housing. As well as being a tool for urban renewal, they have also been carried for public health and social reform reasons. Slum clearances and other programmes focused mainly on the demolition of housing in disadvantaged areas have often been criticized as a means of urban renewal for not adequately addressing the social problems that caused the initial problems in the area. By contrast, slum upgrading is an approach that aims to improve the existing area by directly addressing existing land tenure, infrastructure, and socioeconomic problems.

===Eminent domain===
Also known as land acquisition, compulsory purchase/acquisition, resumption or expropriation in various countries, eminent domain is, in principle, the power to take private property for public use.

However, cases have emerged in the United States in cases where the land acquired was not put to any public use. For example, the Kelo v. City of New London lawsuit ruled that eminent domain may instead transfer acquired private property into private ownership in the case of renewal schemes. The case was brought by a homeowner whose house was acquired and demolished by a private company after the verdict. The company did not complete its contracted construction, leaving the plot empty. Similar occurred in the Rust Belt, where large areas of productive buildings were demolished to enable speculative future development which never materialized. Syracuse, Cincinnati, and Niagara Falls, among many others, cleared entire neighborhoods under urban renewal plans, only for the cleared areas to become surface parking lots, sparse industrial areas, or vacant land.

=== Construction around an event or venue ===
In Barcelona the 1992 Olympics provided a catalyst for infrastructure improvements and the redevelopment of the water front area, and in Bilbao the building of a new art museum was the focus for a new business district around the city&#x27;s derelict dock area. The approach has become very popular in the UK due to the availability of lottery funding for capital projects and the vibrancy of the cultural and creative sectors. However, the arrival of Tate Modern in the London borough of Southwark may be heralded as a catalyst to economic revival in its surrounding neighborhood.

=== Business incentives ===
Urban renewal schemes are often combined with small business and big business incentives.

=== Village renewal ===
The process of urban regeneration is often carried out in rural areas, referred to as village renewal, though it may not be exactly the same in practice. An example being the introduction of tractors in France after the second world war.

==Effects==

=== Improvement of living conditions ===
Replenished housing stock might be an improvement in quality, cultural and social amenity, and opportunities for safety and surveillance. Developments such as London Docklands increased tax revenues for government. In late 1964, the British commentator Neil Wates expressed the opinion that urban renewal in the United States had &#x27;demonstrated the tremendous advantages which flow from an urban renewal programme,&#x27; such as remedying the &#x27;personal problems&#x27; of the poor, creation or renovation of housing stock, educational and cultural &#x27;opportunities&#x27;.

=== Economic benefits ===
Urban renewal might have economic benefits and improve the global economic competitiveness of a city&#x27;s centre.

=== Urban sprawl ===
Urban renewal may increase density and reduce urban sprawl. While urban sprawl is an unrestricted way of expanding the limits of a city, urban renewal clears out undeveloped areas within city limits. While urban sprawl increases urbanization, it can lead to vacant areas and sparse industrial sites.

In some cases, urban renewal may result in increased urban sprawl when city infrastructure begins to include freeways and expressways. Urban renewal triggers urban sprawl to transpire, as a network of highways and interstates becomes the connection between many different cities. Areas are also often cleared in solely order to construct highways, which bring pollution and heavy vehicle traffic to surrounding neighborhoods.

Poorly-conceived designs can lead to the destruction of functional neighborhoods and the creation of new ones which are less desirable or replaced with experimental new development patterns which prove undesirable or not economically sustainable.

=== Displacement of population ===
Community displacement of people living in urban renewal areas comes in various forms. Displacement may be a stated or covert intention of the project, but it may also happen when other renewal objectives are prioritized over the ability of residents to stay in their area, or as an unforeseen consequence of planning decisions. Displacement may be direct, for example in cases where low-income residents are forced to leave their homes and communities, or indirect, for example when renewal is a catalyst for gentrification and/or housing prices rise such that they no longer affordable to low-income residents. Indirect displacement can also result from the interplay of renewal projects and social inequalities, for example when people face discrimination in the housing market based on racial identity.

In the United States, urban redevelopment projects have often resulted in the displacement of low-income inhabitants and Black communities when their dwellings were taken and demolished. In the 1950s, a Southwest Washington renewal project (see Berman v. Parker) displaced thousands of largely African-American families, but provided them with no replacement housing because at the time the law did not provide for any. A model established to improve the growth and urbanization of American cities instead harmed the welfare of many communities. Increasingly, urban redevelopment led to residents being replaced, not by new residents, but by shopping malls, automobile factories and dealerships, and big-box stores. Replacement housing – particularly in the form of high-rise housing for low-income tenants – has not been successful. Hostile architectural designs, together with low-quality construction and maintenance have often led to rapid deterioration and abandonment of these projects. Public housing projects like Cabrini-Green in Chicago and Pruitt-Igoe in St. Louis became so bad that they had to be demolished. In 2000, Portland, Oregon city leaders promised residents whose communities had already been decimated through urban renewal programs that their latest scheme would benefit the poor, the elderly and ethnic minorities. In 2016, Portland Development Commission apologised again after the funds instead went into multimillion-dollar apartment projects, the increasing prices force the African-American and other low-income residents out of the market.

The impact of urban renewal on marginalized communities has been well-documented in ethnographic studies. &quot;Rebuilding Shattered Worlds: Creating Community by Voicing the Past&quot; (2016) examines the destruction of Syrian Town, a diverse neighborhood in Easton, Pennsylvania, and highlights how former residents use collective memory to maintain community ties despite displacement.

=== Loss or change of character ===
In the politics of urban renewal, the state ultimately decides what is important to a city based on its own narrative and existing market conditions, and introduces elements which reflect these values, replacing the infrastructure and character of older city cores. This can have knock-on effects on society and culture more broadly. Professor Kenneth Paul Tan writes that Singapore&#x27;s self-image of having succeeded against all odds has led to strong pressure to pursue progress and development regardless of the destructive cost, postulating that Singapore&#x27;s &quot;culture of comfort and affluence&quot; has developed in order to cope with people&#x27;s repeated loss of their sense of place, redirecting their desires from &quot;community&quot; towards &quot;economic progress, upward mobility, affluent and convenient lifestyles and a ‘world-class’ city.&quot;

== Policies and projects by country ==

===Argentina===
In Buenos Aires, Argentina, Puerto Madero is a known example of an urban renewal project. In the 1990s, the Argentine government decided to build a new residential and commercial district to replace city&#x27;s old port and docks. More than 50 skyscrapers have been built in the last 20 years. Puerto Madero is now Buenos Aires&#x27; most expensive and exclusive neighborhood.

===Australia===
Australia&#x27;s built environment is quite young and the earliest large scale urban renewal projects didn&#x27;t occur until the 1960s in the large cities of Sydney and Melbourne. Housing Commission of New South Wales and the Housing Commission of Victoria conducted large slum recalamation projects in the 1960s replacing large areas of Victorian era housing with international style housing commission towers. These projects were halted in the early 1970s as enthusiasm for Towers in the Park planning waned. In 1971, a plan to raze Sydney&#x27;s historic area The Rocks for public housing was halted by green bans. The CBDs and inner suburban areas of Australia&#x27;s cities have been in constant renewal since the 19th century, however apart from large commercial re-developments this has mostly been done in ad-hoc fashion rather than as major planning initiative. Among the largest projects since the 1980s have been the clearing of most of South Brisbane&#x27;s commercial heart to become South Bank for World Expo 88 and the transformation of large industrial parts of South Melbourne to become the modern hi-rise dominated precinct Southbank. More recent ongoing projects include Darling Harbour in Sydney and Docklands in Melbourne in the late 1980s as well as South Wharf in Melbourne and Barangaroo in Sydney in the 2000s. Urban renewal involving established residential areas is now seldom tolerated and more recent projects have instead concentrated on disused industrial and transport infrastructure or adaptive reuse of older building stock particularly for new hi-rise housing projects. Pyrmont and Ultimo in Sydney and Postcode 3000 in Melbourne in 1992 are two key early examples along with Beacon Cove Fisherman&#x27;s Bend in Melbourne and Urban renewal in Woolstore Precinct, Teneriffe and later Northshore at Hamilton in Brisbane.

===Brazil===
In Rio de Janeiro, the is a large-scale urban waterfront revitalization project, which covers a centrally located five million square meter area. The project aims to redevelop the port area, increasing the city center attractiveness as a whole and enhancing the city&#x27;s competitiveness in the global economy. The urban renovation involves 700 km of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; 5 km of tunnels; 70 km of roads; 650 km2 of sidewalks; 17 km of bike path; 15.000 trees; and 3 plants for sanitation treatment.

=== China ===
China experienced the fastest urbanization and has one of the greatest urban sprawl scale in the world from 1990. Massive real estate development and reconstruction brought economic revitalization. However, when cleaning the urban decay area, traditional and historic buildings were destroyed to different levels. In the industry, researchers and practitioners used “old town reconstruction” and “urban regeneration” to describe the changes made to the urban decay area. After having more research about urban renewal in terms of international trends and domestic development, the practitioners in the industry built consensus to use “urban renewal” to describe all the changes made to the old town area. With the rapid development pace of urbanization in China, the urbanization rate reached the inflection point of the Northam curve. The city development was not about urban sprawl and real estate development on a large scale. China improved its urban development strategy by using inventory planning other than incremental planning. Chinese promoted urbanization aggressively as national policy. But due to the change from the concept of urban renewal in terms of its presentation from the physical dimension, China now promotes small-scale “repairs” to improve the urban environment in a more sustainable and reasonable way. At the 15th China Central City Work Conference, the policy, &quot;urban repair and ecological restoration,&quot; was put forward. Immediately thereafter, new urban renewal models such as Guangzhou&#x27;s micro-renovation and Shanghai&#x27;s micro-renewal appeared to lead the trend of a new era of urban renewal programs in China.

“Planning is inherently political”, however, the urban development in China for the past decade is strikingly similar to the situation in many Western countries. In terms of the similarity sharing with U.S. urban renewal programs, both countries viewed older neighborhoods as outdated and blighted, encouraged local governments to cooperate with local development interests for downtown redevelopment, failed to provide enough support and concern for residents of cleared areas, who often were the low-income residents, and building plenty of highways to reach large scale urban sprawl.

=== Czechia ===
The Josefov neighborhood, or Old Jewish Quarter, in Prague was leveled and rebuilt in an effort at urban renewal between 1890 and 1913.

=== Hong Kong ===

The Urban Renewal Authority is the statutory body responsible for urban renewal in Hong Kong. The Operation Building Bright scheme was launched in 2009 and is subsidised by the government. People remain living inside the buildings during the renovation period, which usually lasts for over a year, leading to concerns about exposure to construction dust and the possible presence of asbestos. Such rehabilitation works are common in districts with older buildings, like Kowloon City, Mong Kok, Sham Shui Po, Yao Ma Tei and Tai Po.

The government of Hong Kong has always been concerned with land shortage and has introduced various policies to increase land supply. One of the current initiatives, noted in the Chief Executive&#x27;s 2022 Policy Address, is to consolidate property interests and expedite urban renewal.

===Iran===
Iranian Urban Renewal corporation is in charge of the program. Tehran and Isfahan and Khorasan and Khuzestan have some of the highest statistics of housing developments. Seventh program offers support to Ministry of Road and Urban and Development for gentrification and development in lesser devoped zones. Funding will also support money going to mass housing developers.

===Ireland===
During the 1990s the concept of culture-led regeneration gained ground. Examples most often cited as successes include Temple Bar in Dublin where tourism was attracted to a bohemian &#x27;cultural quarter&#x27;,

===Israel===

Israel has been undergoing extensive urban renewal projects due to the large number of concrete tenement buildings in its cities which do not meet modern Israeli safety standards and have what is widely considered to be an impoverished and unattractive appearance. Israel built large numbers of these tenement buildings, known in Israel as &quot;train buildings&quot; (בנייני רכבת, &quot;binyanei rakevet&quot;), in the first decades of independence to house masses of Jewish refugees coming from Europe and the Muslim world. Since then, Israeli architectural styles have changed. In addition, these buildings do not meet modern safety regulations: Israeli law has required all new buildings to be built in an earthquake-resistant manner since 1980 and to be built with bomb shelters since 1991. There are two main urban renewal programs: the evacuate and build program and TAMA 38. The evacuate and build program, launched in 1998, allows developers to tear down older building complexes and replace them with larger and more modern buildings, while TAMA 38, launched in 2005, enables developers to extensively remodel buildings, strengthening them against earthquakes, adding safety rooms, remodeling the building&#x27;s appearance, and adding new apartments. In both projects, the tenants are temporarily evacuated for the duration of the work and the developer pays for their alternative accommodation. In both programs, the developers add more apartments so as to sell them to additional tenants and make a profit.

===Italy===
In Italy, the concept of urban renewal had been having the classical meaning of &quot;recovery&quot;, &quot;re-use&quot;, and also &quot;redevelopment&quot; for many years. It has not been long time that this meaning has changed, or has begun to change, towards the Anglo-Saxon model taking in account the idea of an action that &quot;determines an increase of economic, cultural, social values in an existing urban or territorial context.&quot; For instance, we can mention the regional law of 29 July 2008, nr. 21, of the Puglia Region, &quot;Norms for urban regeneration&quot;, which states: «By this law, the Puglia Region promotes the regeneration of parts of cities and urban systems in coherence with municipal and inter-municipal strategies in order to improve urban, socio-economics, environmental and cultural conditions of human settlements &quot;LEGGE REGIONALE 29 luglio 2008, n. 21: &quot;Norme per la rigenerazione urbana&quot;.

A similar concept was carried out by Lombardy Region by mean of its Regional Law of 26 November 2019 - n. 18 &quot;Simplification and incentive measures for urban and territorial regeneration, as well as for the recovery of existing building heritage. Changes and addendums to the regional law 11 March 2005, n. 12 (Law for the Government of the Territory) and other regional laws &quot;Legge Regione Lombardia 18/2019. This law defines the urban regeneration as &quot;the coordinated set of urban-building interventions and social initiatives that can include replacement, re-use, redevelopment of the built environment and reorganization of the urban landscape by mean of recovery of degraded, underused or abandoned areas, as well as through the creation and management of infrastructure, green spaces and services […] with a horizon towards sustainability and environmental and social resilience, technological innovation and increasing biodiversity&quot; (Art 2. L.R.18/2019). The same law introduces some rewards reserved to whom builds for social purposes. Moreover, these rewards are also reserved for those who carry on some particular implementation models. For instance, you can increase the volume of your building whenever &quot;integrated safety systems and construction site risk management processes are applied; methods that are based on traceability and control activities, with particular reference to soil movement and waste traceability, based on advanced technologies&quot;, the increase in the building index is recognized in the art. 3 and these rewards are also given when technologies as geolocation, video surveillance and perimeter protection are implemented in order to prevent the &quot;risk of crime during all phases of construction sites&quot; La legalità per la rigenerazione urbana: a law analysis.

===Morocco===
In the French colonial period, the entire city of Marrakesh - the city inside the defensive walls - was razed and redeveloped, except for the preservation of mosques, madrassas, and funerary memorials. The preserved madrassas include buildings erected as caravanserai.
=== Russia ===

In 2017, Moscow launched a large-scale program to renovate dilapidated Soviet-built housing, known as Khrushchevki. The program provided for the demolition of 5,171 apartment buildings and the resettlement of 1.6 million city residents by 2032. The program was later extended to a number of other Russian cities.

===Singapore===

The history of Singapore&#x27;s urban renewal goes back to the time period surrounding the Second World War. Before the war, Singapore&#x27;s housing environment had already been a problem. The tension of both infrastructure and housing conditions were worsened by the rapidly increasing number of the Singapore population in the 1930s. As a consequence of the war and the lack of economic development, between the 1940s to the 1950s, the previous evil of housing conditions continued to happen. As much as 240,000 squatters were placed in Singapore during the 1950s. It was caused by the movement of migrants, especially from peninsular Malaysia and the baby boom. In mid 1959, overcrowded slums were inhabited by a big number of squatter populations, whereas these areas lacked the existence of service facilities such as sanitation.

Since the establishment of the Republic of Singapore, urban renewal has been included in the part of the national improvement policy that was urgently put in action. Before that, the 1958 master plan had already been designed to solve the city problems. However, due to the lack of urban planning experts caused by the deficiency of professional staff, criticism came from many urban practitioners. The professional team recommended by the United Nations then was asked by the government to cope with the urban renewal matters and its redevelopment plan in 1961. Based on the UN assistance report, two pilot developments were initiated in the end of 1964 by the government. These redevelopments then led to the success of Singapore&#x27;s urban renewal because the government could provide sufficient amount of public housing and business areas.

In the establishment of urban renewal programmes, some difficulties were experienced by the PAP government. The obstacles came from the resistance of people who used to live in the slums and squatters. It was reported by Singapore newspapers that those people were reluctant to be replaced. This became the major problems of 1960s redevelopment schemes. Affordable land value also became one of its reasons. Another problem was that the government had to purchase the private land owned by the middle and upper society to make the land vacant and be used for redevelopment.

===South Korea===

Urban regeneration in South Korea began in the 1950s with the reconstruction from Korean War, but the first &quot;Urban Redevelopment Act&quot; was passed in 1976. This began 20 years of large-scale clearance projects, which did not address socioeconomic problems and led to the breakdown of communities. In the 2000s, the government&#x27;s focus changed from redevelopment to maintenance of existing developments.

===Taiwan===
In Taipei, Taiwan, Xinyi Special District is a known example of an urban renewal project. Its historical development began in 1976, when the Taipei Municipal Government accepted the proposal to redevelop the area east of the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall. The goal of this redevelopment was to set up a secondary commercial center away from the more crowded old city center (Taipei Station, Ximending area). The redevelopment hoped to increase the prosperity of the eastern district and the convenience of urban life for existing residents. The center&#x27;s purpose was to expand business investment in the area and attract international financial services and technology firms. It also planned for residential development by building a completely new community. The Xinyi Project Area is the only commercial development area in Taipei with a wholly planned street and urban design. In addition to attracting corporations, it also features large retail spaces, department stores, and shopping malls. Xinyi Special District is now the prime central business district of Taipei.

===United Kingdom===
==== 19th century ====
From the 1850s onwards, the terrible conditions of the urban poor in the slums of London began to attract the attention of social reformers and philanthropists, who began a movement for social housing. The first area to be targeted was the notorious slum called the Devil&#x27;s Acre near Westminster. This new movement was largely funded by George Peabody and the Peabody Trust and had a lasting impact on the urban character of Westminster.

Slum clearance began with the Rochester Buildings, on the corner of Old Pye Street and Perkin&#x27;s Rent, which were built in 1862 by the merchant William Gibbs. They are one of the earliest large-scale philanthropic housing developments in London. The Rochester Buildings were sold to the Peabody Trust in 1877 and later become known as Blocks A to D of the Old Perkin&#x27;s Rents Estate. Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts funded an experimental social housing estate, among the first of its kind, on the corner of Columbia Road and Old Pye Street (now demolished). In 1869, the Peabody Trust built one of its first housing estates at Brewer&#x27;s Green, between Victoria Street and St. James&#x27;s Park. What remained of the Devil&#x27;s Acre on the other side of Victoria Street was cleared and further Peabody estates were built after the Cross Act of 1875.

In 1882, the Peabody Trust built the Abbey Orchard Estate on former marshland at the corner of Old Pye Street and Abbey Orchard Street. Like many of the social housing estates, the Abbey Orchard Estate was built following the square plan concept. Blocks of flats were built around a courtyard, creating a semi-private space within the estate functioning as recreation area. The courtyards were meant to create a community atmosphere and the blocks of flats were designed to allow sunlight into the courtyards. The blocks of flats were built using high-quality brickwork and included architectural features such as lettering, glazing, fixtures and fittings. The estates built in the area at the time were considered model dwellings and included shared laundry and sanitary facilities, innovative at the time, and fireplaces in some bedrooms. The design was subsequently repeated in numerous other housing estates in London.

State intervention was first achieved with the passage of the Public Health Act of 1875 through Parliament. The Act focused on combating filthy urban living conditions that were the cause of disease outbreaks. It required all new residential construction to include running water and an internal drainage system and also prohibited the construction of shoddy housing by building contractors.
The London County Council was created in 1889 as the municipal authority in the County of London and in 1890 the Old Nichol in the East End of London was declared a slum and the Council authorized its clearance and the rebuilding of an area of some , including the Nichol and Snow estates, and a small piece on the Shoreditch side of Boundary Street, formally Cock Lane. The slum clearance began in 1891 and included 730 houses inhabited by 5,719 people. The LCC architects designed 21 and Rowland Plumbe two of 23 blocks containing between 10 and 85 tenements each. A total of 1,069 tenements, mostly two or three-roomed, were planned to accommodate 5,524 persons. The project was hailed as setting &quot;new aesthetic standards for housing the working classes&quot; and included a new laundry, 188 shops, and 77 workshops. Churches and schools were preserved. Building for the project began in 1893 and it was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1900. Other such schemes in the 1880s, where newly cleared sites were sold on to developers, included Whitechapel, Wild Street, Whitecross Street and Clerkenwell.

====Interwar period====
The 1917 Tudor Walters Committee Report into the provision of housing and post-war reconstruction in the United Kingdom, was commissioned by Parliament as a response to the shocking lack of fitness amongst many recruits during the War; this was attributed to poor living conditions, a belief summed up in a housing poster of the period &quot;you cannot expect to get an A1 population out of C3 homes&quot;.

The report&#x27;s recommendations, coupled with a chronic housing shortage after the First World War led to a government-led program of house building with the slogan &#x27;Homes for Heroes&#x27;. Christopher Addison, the Minister for Housing at the time was responsible for the drafting of the Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Act 1919 which introduced the new concept of the state being involved in the building of new houses. This marked the start of a long 20th century tradition of state-owned housing, which would much later evolve into council estates.

With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, increased house building and government expenditure was used to pull the country out of recession. The Housing Act of 1930 gave local councils wide-ranging powers to demolish properties unfit for human habitation or that posed a danger to health, and obligated them to rehouse those people who were relocated due to the large scale slum clearance programs. Cities with a large proportion of Victorian terraced housing – housing that was no longer deemed of sufficient standard for modern living requirements – underwent the greatest changes. Over 5,000 homes (25,000 residents) in the city of Bristol were designated as redevelopment areas in 1933 and slated for demolition. Although efforts were made to house the victims of the demolitions in the same area as before, in practice this was too difficult to fully implement and many people were rehoused in other areas, even different cities. In an effort to rehouse the poorest people affected by redevelopment, the rent for housing was set at an artificially low level, although this policy also only achieved mixed success.

Post-Second World War

Post-war reconstruction was a catalyst for much urban renewal in the UK.

==== Since the 1990s ====
The Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) was a project run by the government from 1994 to 2002 to enable regeneration in areas with social and economic problems, with funds allocated through a competitive bidding system. The Housing Market Renewal Initiative (also known as the Pathfinder Scheme) was in place between 2002 and 2011 and aimed to demolish, refurbish or construct new housing. Areas of housing that were demolished were replaced with new houses aimed towards attracting richer tenants to move to the area, rather than use by the areas&#x27; former residents. Other programs, such as The Castleford Project (2002-2005) sought to enable local citizens to have greater control and ownership of the direction of their community and the way in which it overcomes market failure. This approach supports important themes in urban renewal today, such as participation, sustainability and trust – and government acting as advocate and &#x27;enabler&#x27;, rather than an instrument of command and control.

Currently there are two main Urban Regeneration projects going on in London, Elephant Park at Elephant &amp; Castle and at Stratford. These are both being done by Lendlease, a multinational company focusing on redeveloping neglected city areas.

===United States===
In the United States the term &#x27;urban renewal&#x27; technically refers only to a federal program in the middle-to-late 20th Century, but colloquially is sometimes used to refer to any large-scale change in urban development. Urban renewal is a widely discussed and controversial program. Urban renewal sometimes lives up to the hopes of its original proponents – it has been assessed by politicians, urban planners, civic leaders, and residents – it has played an important but controversial role. But at other times urban redevelopment projects have failed in several American cities, having wasted large amounts of public funds to no purpose. It has been seen by proponents as an economic engine and a reform mechanism, and by critics as a mechanism for control.

====1900 to 1950s====

Prior to the Urban Renewal policies of the 1950s, cities in the United States revitalized with large scale projects like the design and construction of Central Park in New York and the 1909 Plan for Chicago by Daniel Burnham. Similarly, the efforts of Jacob Riis in advocating for improved living conditions in degraded areas of New York in the late 19th century were also formative. The redevelopment of large sections of New York City and New York State by Robert Moses between the 1930s and the 1970s was a notable and prominent example of urban redevelopment. Moses directed the construction of new bridges, highways, housing projects, and public parks.

Other cities across the US began to create redevelopment programs in the late 1930s and 1940s. These early projects were generally focused on slum clearance and were implemented by local public housing authorities, which were responsible both for clearing slums and for building new affordable housing. In Detroit, the (local) City Planning and Housing Council (CHPC) founded in 1937 had a large hand in the reconstruction of urban slums, with their primary mission being the elimination of poor housing conditions, creating less crowded and cleaner public housing.

In 1944, the GI Bill (officially the Serviceman&#x27;s Readjustment Act) guaranteed Veterans Administration (VA) mortgages to veterans under favorable terms, which fueled suburbanization after the end of World War II, as places like Levittown, New York, Warren, Michigan and the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles were transformed from farmland into cities occupied by tens of thousands of families in a few years. However, the GI Bill was primarily beneficial for white veterans over black ones, so in inner cities where black veterans tried using the benefits from the GI bill to occur housing and/or jobs, it was much more difficult.

The Housing Act of 1949, also known as the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Act, provided federal loans to cities to acquire and clear slum areas to be sold to private developers to redevelop in accordance with a plan prepared by the city (normally with new housing), and grants to cover two-thirds of the portion of the city&#x27;s costs in excess of the sale prices received from the developers, as well as provide millions of dollars to create public housing throughout the country. The phrase used at the time was &quot;urban redevelopment&quot;. &quot;Urban renewal&quot; was a phrase popularized with the passage of the Housing Act of 1954, which made these projects more enticing to developers by, among other things, providing mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).

The term &quot;urban renewal&quot; was not introduced in the USA until the Housing Act was again amended in 1954. That was also the year in which the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the general validity of urban redevelopment statutes in the landmark case, &quot;Berman v. Parker&quot;.

Under the powerful influence of multimillionaire R.K. Mellon, Pittsburgh became the first major city to undertake a modern urban-renewal program in May 1950. Pittsburgh was infamous around the world as one of the dirtiest and most economically depressed cities, and seemed ripe for urban renewal. A large section of downtown at the heart of the city was demolished, converted to parks, office buildings, and a sports arena and renamed the Golden Triangle in what was generally recognized as a major success. Other neighborhoods were also subjected to urban renewal, but with mixed results. Some areas did improve, while other areas, such as East Liberty and the Hill District, declined following ambitious projects that shifted traffic patterns, blocked streets to vehicular traffic, isolated or divided neighborhoods with highways, and removed large numbers of ethnic and minority residents. An entire neighborhood was destroyed (to be replaced by the Civic Arena), displacing 8000 residents (most of whom were poor and black).

Because of the ways in which it targeted the most disadvantaged sector of the American population, novelist James Baldwin famously dubbed Urban Renewal &quot;Negro Removal&quot; in the 1960s.

Early to mid-20th century Detroit was a prime area for urban &quot;redevelopers&quot;, as much of the city had only decrepit housing available. The efforts of the CHPC and the FHA to renew Detroit caused huge amounts of black displacement due to the construction of highways and airports directly through black neighborhoods like 8-mile and Paradise Valley. Black families were thrown out from their homes and not provided relocation services. The &quot;slums&quot; being cleared or being looked at for redevelopment were primarily black neighborhoods.

In 1956, the Federal-Aid Highway Act gave state and federal government complete control over new highways, and often they were routed directly through vibrant urban neighborhoods—isolating or destroying many—since the focus of the program was to bring traffic in and out of the central cores of cities as expeditiously as possible and nine out of every ten dollars spent came from the federal government. This resulted in a serious degradation of the tax bases of many cities, isolated entire neighborhoods, and meant that existing commercial districts were bypassed by the majority of commuters. Segregation continued to increase as communities were displaced. Black families that had their homes and neighborhoods destroyed had to find housing options deeper in the inner city as whites could then use those highways to spread further and further into the suburbs but continue to work in the city.

In Boston, one of the country&#x27;s oldest cities, almost a third of the old city was demolished—including the historic West End—to make way for a new highway, low- and moderate-income high-rises (which eventually became luxury housing), and new government and commercial buildings. This came to be seen as a tragedy by many residents and urban planners, and one of the centerpieces of the redevelopment—Government Center—is still considered an example of the excesses of urban renewal.

====Reaction against urban renewal====
In 1961, Jane Jacobs published &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot;, one of the first—and strongest—critiques of contemporary large-scale urban renewal. However, it would still be a few years before organized movements began to oppose urban renewal. The Rondout neighborhood in Kingston, New York (on the Hudson River) was essentially destroyed by a federally funded urban renewal program in the 1960s, with more than 400 old buildings demolished, most of them historic brick structures built in the 19th century. Similarly ill-conceived urban renewal programs gutted the historic centers of other towns and cities across America in the 1950s and 1960s (for example the West End neighborhood in Boston, the Gateway District of Minneapolis, the downtown area of Norfolk, Virginia and the historic waterfront areas of the towns of Narragansett and Newport in Rhode Island).

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a landmark law to prohibit discrimination based on race, gender, religion, sex, national origin, and later sexual orientation and gender identity through legal means. At this time, racial deed restrictions on housing were legally removed and banned, which was an important step for Desegregation in the United States. However, redlining still existed to present the unequal real estate transaction for many ethnic minorities. Even though segregation was explicitly illegal, discrimination under urban planning context has been deep-rooted.

From 1965 to 1967, riots swept many cities across the States—most drastically in Detroit during the 12th Street Riot. By the 1970s many major cities developed opposition to the sweeping urban-renewal plans for their cities. In Boston, community activists halted construction of the proposed Southwest Expressway but only after a three-mile long stretch of land had been cleared. In San Francisco, Joseph Alioto was the first mayor to publicly repudiate the policy of urban renewal, and with the backing of community groups, forced the state to end construction of highways through the heart of the city. Atlanta lost over 60,000 people between 1960 and 1970 because of urban renewal and expressway construction, but a downtown building boom turned the city into the showcase of the New South in the 1970s and 1980s. In the early 1970s in Toronto, Jacobs was heavily involved in a group which halted the construction of the Spadina Expressway and altered transport policy in that city.

Some of the policies around urban renewal began to change under President Lyndon Johnson and the War on Poverty, and in 1968, the Housing and Urban Development Act and The New Communities Act of 1968 guaranteed private financing for private entrepreneurs to plan and develop new communities. Subsequently, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 established the Community Development Block Grant program (CDBG) which began in earnest the focus on redevelopment of existing neighborhoods and properties, rather than demolition of substandard housing and economically depressed areas.

Until 1970, the displaced owners and tenants received only the constitutionally-mandated &quot;just compensation&quot; specified in the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This measure of compensation covered only the fair market value of the taken property, and omitted compensation for a variety of incidental losses like, for example, moving expenses, loss of favorable financing and notably, business losses, such as loss of business goodwill. In the 1970s the federal government and state governments enacted the Uniform Relocation Assistance Act which provides for limited compensation of some of these losses. However the Act denies the displaced land owners the right to sue to enforce its provisions, so it is deemed an act of legislative grace rather than a constitutional right. Historically, urban redevelopment has been controversial because of such practices as taking private property by eminent domain for &quot;public use&quot; and then turning it over to redevelopers free of charge or for less than the acquisition cost (known as &quot;land write-down&quot;). Thus, in the controversial Connecticut case of Kelo v. City of New London (2005) the plan called for a redeveloper to lease the subject 90-acre waterfront property for $1 per year.

Currently, a mix of renovation, selective demolition, commercial development, and tax incentives is most often used to revitalize urban neighborhoods. An example of an entire eradication of a community is Africville in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Gentrification is still controversial, and often results in familiar patterns of poorer residents being priced out of urban areas into suburbs or more depressed areas of cities. Some programs, such as that administered by Fresh Ministries and Operation New Hope in Jacksonville, Florida, and the Hill Community Development Corporation (Hill CDC) in Pittsburgh&#x27;s historic Hill District attempt to develop communities, while at the same time combining highly favorable loan programs with financial literacy education so that poorer residents are not displaced.

====Niagara Falls, New York====

An example of urban renewal gone wrong in the United States is in downtown Niagara Falls, New York. Most of the original downtown was demolished in the 1960s, and many replacement projects including the Rainbow Centre Factory Outlet, Niagara Falls Convention and Civic Center, the Native American Cultural Center, the Hooker Chemical (later the Occidental Petroleum) Headquarters building, the Wintergarden, the Fallsville Splash Park, a large parking ramp, an enclosed pedestrian walkway, the Falls Street Faire &amp; Falls Street Station entertainment complexes, and the Mayor E. Dent Lackey Plaza closed within twenty to thirty years of their construction.
In addition, the Robert Moses State Parkway cut through the town, dividing it from the riverfront. As in many American cities, some demolished blocks were never replaced.

Ultimately, the former tourist district of the city along Falls Street was destroyed. It went against the principles of several urban philosophers, such as Jane Jacobs, who claimed that mixed-use districts were needed (which the new downtown was not) and arteries needed to be kept open. Smaller buildings also should be built or kept. In Niagara Falls, however, the convention center blocked traffic into the city, located in the center of Falls Street (the main artery), and the Wintergarden also blocked traffic from the convention center to the Niagara Falls. The Rainbow Centre interrupted the street grid, taking up three blocks, and parking ramps isolated the city from the core, leading to the degradation of nearby neighborhoods. Tourists were forced to walk around the Rainbow Center, the Wintergarden, and the Quality Inn (all of which were adjacent), in total five blocks, discouraging small business in the city. These issues have spawned ongoing efforts to address them.

===South Africa===
From 1938 to 1942, the Central Housing Board and Cape Town City Council constructed 13,000 flats as part of slum clearance projects. In the mid-1950s, some residential areas of Johannesburg were to be involuntarily removed by city planners. Black townships were targeted, motivated by residents&#x27; participation in civil unrest against the Apartheid government authorities in 1949 and 1950. In post-apartheid South Africa major grassroots social movements such as the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign and Abahlali baseMjondolo emerged to contest &#x27;urban renewal&#x27; programs that forcibly relocated the poor out of the cities.

In addition, the Mayor oversees all city services, public property, police and fire protection, most public agencies, and shares with the Governor of Maryland, responsibilities for the public school system within the city limits. As of December 8, 2020, the Office of the Mayor of the City of Baltimore has changed hands 62 times with 53 different individuals in assuming office in the 223 years of city government, 1797–2020. The Office of the Mayor is located in the historic Baltimore City Hall located at 100 Holliday Street in downtown Baltimore.

==History==
James Calhoun was first elected in 1794 under the old Baltimore Town government with a group of town commissioners, and continued as the first mayor under the new City Charter in 1796–97, when the city was incorporated as the &quot;City of Baltimore&quot; under the authority of the Maryland General Assembly, which had originally authorized the port in 1706 and the creation of a town in 1729 and its laying out in early 1730. Calhoun continued to serve for another seven years until 1804.

Baltimore had been the county seat of surrounding Baltimore County, which had been &quot;erected&quot; (authorized) in 1659 as the fifth county designated in the Province of Maryland and first county in northern Maryland, since finagling a scheme to move the courthouse from old Joppa in 1767. The city was separated from the adjacent County by the provisions of the new second Maryland Constitution of 1851 and became an independent city with the same status as the other 22 (later 23) counties of Maryland. Then the seat for Baltimore County was moved after a referendum to Towsontown (later Towson), a few miles north of Baltimore, with the building there in 1854 of its first courthouse structure.

Six individuals are credited with multiple, non-consecutive returns to the office after completing an initial term, and are counted as separate mayoralties. These are:
Edward Johnson (twice), John Montgomery, Ferdinand C. Latrobe (elected four times), Howard W. Jackson, William F. Broening, and Theodore R. McKeldin.

The mayor was originally elected to a term of two years under the original City Charter of 1796–1797. In 1920, the charter was amended so the mayor serves a term of four years. There are no limits on the number of terms a mayor may serve.

For years, the mayor was elected in the year immediately preceding the presidential election. However, in 2012, the 2015 election was postponed to 2016 in order to better align with national elections. As a result, incumbent Stephanie Rawlings-Blake had her term extended an additional year. An earlier attempt to move the mayoral election to the same year as presidential elections was made in 1999, but went awry when the General Assembly refused to move the primary election. As a result, then-incumbent Martin O&#x27;Malley was nominated for a second term in 2003, then had to wait over a year to run in and win the general election.

Baltimore has experienced major turnover in the mayor&#x27;s office in recent years, in large part due to corruption scandals. In September 2015, incumbent mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced she would not seek re-election, setting up a hotly-contested primary election in the heavily Democratic city in 2016. Maryland State Senator Catherine Pugh defeated former mayor Shelia Dixon, who resigned from office in 2010 after pleading guilty to misappropriating holiday gift cards intended to serve poor Baltimore residents. Pugh easily defeated Republican Alan Walden and Green Party candidate Joshua Harris to become the 50th Mayor of Baltimore, and was sworn in on December 6, 2016. Pugh resigned on May 2, 2019, amid a scandal in which Pugh was accused of, and eventually pled guilty to charges of fraud, conspiracy, and tax evasion regarding a scheme to sell copies of a self-published children&#x27;s book series, known as Healthy Holly, to the University of Maryland Medical System without competition. Upon Pugh&#x27;s resignation, then-City Council President Jack Young took over as Mayor. In the 2020 Democratic primary, Young went up against Dixon, his successor as City Council President Brandon Scott, former T. Rowe Price executive and Obama administration Treasury Department official Mary Miller, former federal prosecutor and deputy Attorney General of Maryland Thiruvendran Vignarajah. Scott narrowly edged out Dixon, with Young finishing a distant fifth. Brandon Scott was elected with more than 70% of the vote in the November general election, and was sworn in as the city&#x27;s 52nd Mayor on December 8, 2020.

Some well-known political and historical figures to have held the office of Mayor of Baltimore include:

* Samuel Smith, Revolutionary War soldier and War of 1812 commander, twice elected to the House of Representatives and Senate respectively, twice served as President Pro Tempore of the Senate, served as Mayor from 1835 until 1838.
* Thomas Swann, member of the American Party, better known as the &quot;Know-Nothings,&quot; served as Mayor from 1856 until 1860, was elected as the 33rd Governor of Maryland in 1866, and subsequently served in the House of Representatives for ten years until 1879.
* William Pinkney Whyte, served as mayor from 1881 until 1883, served three non-consecutive terms as United States Senator, was elected the 35th Governor of Maryland in 1872, and as Attorney General of Maryland in 1887.
* Thomas D&#x27;Alesandro, Jr., served three terms as Mayor from 1947 until 1959, best known outside of Baltimore as the father to future Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, son Thomas D&#x27;Alesandro III also served as Mayor for one term from 1967 until 1971.
* William Donald Schaefer, served four terms as Mayor, the most of anyone to hold the office, from 1971 until 1987, when he became the 58th Governor of Maryland. Schaefer would also serve as Comptroller of Maryland later in life from 1999 until 2007.
* Kurt Schmoke, served three terms as Mayor from 1987 until 1999, was the first African-American to be elected Mayor of Baltimore.
* Martin O&#x27;Malley, served two terms as Mayor of Baltimore from 1999 until 2007, when he became the 61st Governor of Maryland, was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in 2016, dropped out of contest in the winter of 2016 after failing to secure a strong finish in the Iowa caucuses.

<doc id="329776" wikidata="Q7714274" url="?curid=329776" title="The Armada (book)">
<text>The Armada is a popular history by Garrett Mattingly—a historian who taught at Columbia University—about the attempt of the Spanish Armada to invade England in 1588. It was published in 1959 by Houghton Mifflin Company, and Mattingly won a special Pulitzer Prize for the work in 1960 as &quot;a first class history and a literary work of high order.&quot; It was published in the UK in the same year by Jonathan Cape under the title &quot;The Defeat of the Spanish Armada&quot;.

One biographer wrote that &quot;The Armada&quot; was &quot;written in purple prose but a royal purple, which read like historical fiction.&quot; Another biographer noted that Mattingly &quot;treated his job as that of telling a story about people&quot; and that &quot;The Armada&quot; was &quot;that rarity, a book by a professional historian and admired by professional historians which nevertheless became a best seller.&quot; &quot;The Armada&quot; remains in print and has also been issued outside the United States under the title &quot;The Defeat of the Spanish Armada&quot;.

<doc id="329781" wikidata="Q8713" url="?curid=329781" title="Ctenizidae">
<text>Ctenizidae ( ) is a small family of mygalomorph spiders that construct burrows with a cork-like trapdoor made of soil, vegetation, and silk. They may be called [[Ctenizidae|trapdoor spiders]], as are other, similar species, such as those of the families Liphistiidae, Barychelidae, and Cyrtaucheniidae, and some species in the Idiopidae and Nemesiidae. The name comes from the distinctive behavior of the spiders to construct trapdoors, and ambush prey from beneath them. 

In 2018, the family Halonoproctidae was split off from the Ctenizidae. A further genus, &quot;Stasimopus&quot;, was split off into its own family, Stasimopidae, in 2020. The family currently consists of two genera and five species.

==Etymology==
The name derives from Greek &quot;ktenizein&quot;, meaning &quot;combing&quot; or &quot;cleaning&quot;, referring to their behaviour of cleaning continuously, and the suffix &quot;-idae&quot;, which designates belonging to a family.

==Taxonomy==
The family Ctenizidae was first described by Thorell in 1887, being based on the genus &quot;Cteniza&quot;. Since the advent of molecular phylogenetics and its application to spiders, the family has been progressively dismantled; the World Spider Catalog lists over 100 genera formerly placed in Ctenizidae but now transferred to other families. The Halonoproctidae were split off in 2018, leaving only three genera. Even so, the family was not monophyletic, since &quot;Stasimopus&quot; is not in the same clade as the other two genera, according to a 2018 study (the three genera left in the Ctenizidae at that time are shaded in yellow):

In 2020, a large scale molecular phylogenetic study confirmed the placement of &quot;Stasimopus&quot; outside the clade consisting of &quot;Cteniza&quot; and &quot;Cyrtocarenum&quot;, and transferred it to its own family, Stasimopidae. This placement is accepted by the World Spider Catalog .

===Genera===
, the World Spider Catalog accepted only two extant genera:
* &quot;Cteniza&quot; — Europe, Central Asia
* &quot;Cyrtocarenum&quot; — Greece, Turkey

;Extinct genera
* †&quot;Baltocteniza&quot; Early Eocene Baltic amber
* †&quot;Electrocteniza&quot; Early Eocene Baltic amber

==Distribution and habitat==
The two genera of Ctenizidae are found in Europe and Turkey, particularly in France and Italy. Like many other mygalomorphs, &quot;Cteniza&quot; have highly localized distributions. This results in clumps of spider burrows a short distance from their maternal burrows, resulting in a dense cluster of spiders surrounding a large female.

<doc id="329788" wikidata="Q699355" url="?curid=329788" title="Holger Czukay">
<text>Holger Schüring (24 March 1938 – 5 September 2017), known professionally as Holger Czukay (), was a German musician best known as a co-founder of the krautrock group Can. Described as &quot;successfully bridg[ing] the gap between pop and the avant-garde&quot;, Czukay was also notable for having created early important examples of ambient music, for having explored &quot;world music&quot; well before the term was coined, and for having been a pioneer of sampling.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Czukay was born as Holger Schüring on 24 March 1938 in the Free City of Danzig (present-day Gdańsk, Poland). According to Holger, his grandfather told the Third Reich officials that their family &quot;must be Aryan&quot;, and came up with a family tree supporting the claim. Additionally, the family changed their Polish last name &quot;Czukay&quot; to Schüring, a Dutch name. In early 1945, after World War II, his family was expelled from Poland. They booked tickets for a passage on the ship MV Wilhelm Gustloff, which was due to depart on 13 January 1945, but at the last moment his grandmother changed her mind and took them to the railway station, where they boarded a train carrying wounded soldiers to Berlin. MV Wilhelm Gustloff was hit by a Soviet torpedo, and almost ten thousand passengers died.

Czukay family resettled to Limburg an der Lahn, and when Holger was in his teens, moved to Duisburg, where he attended the Gerhard Mercator Scientific School and worked part-time in a radio and TV repair shop. While working at the shop he became fond of the aural qualities of radio broadcasts (anticipating his use of shortwave radio broadcasts as musical elements) and became familiar with the rudiments of electrical repair and engineering. Around that time, in the late fifties, Czukay was playing double bass in local jazz bands, including his own Holger Czukay Quintet. His fascination for music inclined Czukay&#x27;s relocation to East Berlin and enrollment at the Hochschule für Musik Hanns Eisler Berlin in February 1962. Holger was expelled from the Berlin Music Academy, but kept pursuing his music studies.

Czukay signed up to Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s new-music course in Cologne, studying under Stockhausen from 1963 to 1966. While studying he met his future Can bandmates—Irmin Schmidt and David C. Johnson. In May 1966, Czukay resettled to St Gallen (Switzerland) taking up a lecturing post in music at the Institut auf dem Rosenberg. One of his pupils, Michael Karoli, familiered Czukay with the contemporary rock music, introducing him to The Beatles, Velvet Underground, and Frank Zappa. Holger particularly liked &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, impressed by its unusual musical structure and blasts of AM radio noise; perpetrating &quot;avant-garde pranks in a pop/rock context&quot;. Czukay and Karoli played with rock pianist Tony Ashton and several members of his band, Remo Four, proposing him an idea to form an experimental band, but didn&#x27;t followed through. When Michael was finishing school, Czukay was fired from the Institut auf dem Rosenberg, as Czukay explained, &quot;for being too … er … intriguing!&quot;

In late Autumn 1967, Czukay got a letter from Irmin inviting Holger to form a group in Cologne. Czukay brought Karoli with him.

===Career===
Czukay co-founded Can in 1968, where he played bass guitar, and undertook most of the recording and engineering for the group. During live performances Holger wore his signature white gloves using them while playing bass to protect his fingertips for tape editing, and also to absorb sweat. Rosko Gee, former bassist of the British band Traffic, joined the band in 1977, with Czukay handling only tapes and sound effects on the album &quot;Saw Delight&quot;, his final LP with the group before departing for a solo career. Czukay had been sidelined due to creative disputes and his failure to progress as a bassist, admitting his shortcomings on the instrument which he had taken up &quot;almost by default&quot; in the early days of Can.

After his departure from Can, Czukay recorded several solo albums. One of his trademarks was the use of shortwave radio sounds and his early pioneering of sampling, in those days involving the painstaking cutting and splicing of magnetic tapes. He would tape-record various sounds and snippets from shortwave and incorporate them into his compositions. He also used shortwave as a live, interactive musical instrument (such as on 1991&#x27;s &quot;Radio Wave Surfer&quot;), a method of composition he termed &quot;radio painting&quot;. Czukay also stated &quot;If you want to make something new, you shouldn&#x27;t think too far beyond one certain idea&quot;.

Czukay continued to work with the former members of Can: playing bass on Irmin Schmidt&#x27;s soundtrack pieces released in &quot;Filmmusik Vol.2&quot; (1981), recording &quot;Full Circle&quot; (1982) with Jaki Liebezeit, and mastering Michael Karoli&#x27;s debut album &quot;Deluge&quot; (1984). Czukay further collaborated with a number of musicians, notably a series of albums with Jah Wobble and David Sylvian, two younger British musicians who shared his interest in blending pop music with experimental recording and sampling techniques. Other collaborators include U.N.K.L.E., Brian Eno, Eurythmics, and German Neue Deutsche Welle band Trio.

In 2009, after a problematic time with the record company that had been gradually re-releasing his albums on CD, Czukay began a new collaboration with the Claremont 56 record label, releasing vinyl-only remixes of tracks from earlier albums, as well as some new recordings. This approach changed Czukay&#x27;s plans for his back catalogue, so that the original albums &quot;Der Osten ist Rot&quot; (1984), &quot;Rome Remains Rome&quot; (1987) and &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; (1993) are no longer being reissued (in the case of &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, because the master tapes have degraded beyond repair). Instead, most of the tracks are being remade and newly organized as limited edition vinyl releases.

In 2018, it was announced that Czukay&#x27;s work was being released in a box set, &quot;Cinema&quot;, including his solo works, collaborations, and unreleased material. It was released in March 2018.

===Personal life===
Holger Czukay was married for nearly thirty years to the German painter and singer Ursula Kloss (known professionally as Ursa Major, and later as U-She), with whom he collaborated on numerous multimedia pieces. Ursula Schüring (as she was called after marrying Holger Schüring under his real name) died on her 55th birthday (28 July 2017) after having been severely debilitated by illness for over a decade.

===Death===
On 5 September 2017, Czukay was found dead in his apartment, converted from Can&#x27;s old studio in Weilerswist, near Cologne. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that he had died on the same day, but the cause of his death was the subject of a police investigation. His death was eventually assumed to have been from natural causes.

<text>Smokey Bear is an American campaign and advertising icon of the U.S. Forest Service in the Wildfire Prevention Campaign, which is the longest-running public service announcement campaign in United States history to date. The Ad Council, the Forest Service, and the National Association of State Foresters, in partnership with the creative agency FCB, use the character of Smokey Bear to educate the public about the dangers of unplanned human-caused wildfires.

The first campaign featuring Smokey began in 1944; it used the slogan &quot;Smokey Says – Care Will Prevent 9 out of 10 Forest Fires&quot;. (Smokey&#x27;s name has always intentionally been spelled differently from the adjective &quot;smoky&quot;.) In 1947, the slogan was changed to &quot;Remember... Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires.&quot; This version of the slogan was used continually in Smokey Bear campaigns until April 2001, when the message was officially updated to &quot;Only You Can Prevent Wildfires.&quot; This change was made in response to a massive outbreak of wildfires occurring in natural areas other than forests (such as grasslands), and to clarify that Smokey was promoting the prevention of unplanned outdoor fires, not prescribed burns. Smokey has also been given additional lines to say throughout the years.

According to the Ad Council, in 2018, 80% of outdoor recreationists correctly identified Smokey Bear&#x27;s image, and 8 in 10 recognized the campaign’s public service announcements.

Smokey Bear&#x27;s name and image are protected by the &quot;Smokey Bear Act of 1952&quot; (16 U.S.C. 580 (p-2); previously also 18 U.S.C. 711).

==History==
===Origins===
Although the U.S. Forest Service had been fighting wildfires long before the outbreak of World War II, the war brought a new importance and urgency to the effort. At the time, many experienced firefighters and other able-bodied men were serving in the armed forces, leaving fewer at home to fight wildfires. U.S. planners hoped that, if Americans knew how wildfires would harm the war effort, they would work with the Forest Service to reduce their occurrence. The Forest Service began using colorful posters to educate Americans about the dangers of wildfires in the hope that local communities could prevent them from starting in the first place. Careless citizens were not the only fire threat, however; the Empire of Japan considered using wildfires as a weapon, and in the spring of 1942, Japanese submarines surfaced near the coast of Santa Barbara, California, and fired shells that exploded on an oil field close to Los Padres National Forest. The Japanese military implemented a concerted wildfire strategy later in the war, launching some 9,000 fire balloons into the jet stream; an estimated 11% of these reached the U.S. between November 1944 and April 1945. Only one balloon bomb is known to have caused fatalities: Elsie Mitchell (the wife of Archie E. Mitchell) and five children were killed by one near Bly, Oregon, on May 5, 1945. A memorial was erected at what was later named the Mitchell Monument Historic Site.

===Campaign beginnings===
In 1942, the U.S. Forest Service established the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention program, and on August 13 of that year, Disney&#x27;s full-length animated motion picture &quot;Bambi&quot; premiered in New York City. Soon after, Walt Disney allowed his characters to appear in fire-prevention public service campaigns. However, &quot;Bambi&quot; was only loaned to the government for a year, so after that the Forest Service needed a new symbol. After much discussion, a bear was chosen, based on a rough sketch made by Forest Service artist Harry Rossoll. His name was inspired by &quot;Smokey&quot; Joe Martin, a New York City Fire Department hero who had suffered burns and blindness during a bold fire rescue in 1922.

On August 9, 1944, the Forest Service authorized the creation of Smokey Bear as its official symbol. This date has since been considered the character&#x27;s birthday. The first Smokey Bear poster was delivered on October 10 by artist Albert Staehle. In the first poster, overseen by the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Campaign, Smokey was depicted wearing jeans and a campaign hat, pouring a bucket of water on a campfire. The message underneath read, &quot;S S;– Care will prevent 9 out of 10 forest fires!&quot;

In 1947, the Wartime Advertising Council (later the Ad Council) coined the slogan that was associated with Smokey Bear thereafter for more than five decades: &quot;Remember...only YOU can prevent forest fires.&quot; In 2001, the slogan was officially amended to replace &quot;forest fires&quot; with &quot;wildfires&quot; in response to numerous outbreaks of wildfires in natural areas other than forests, and to clarify that the campaign was advocating for the prevention of unplanned fires, not of controlled burns or of fires prescribed for conservation purposes.

===Living symbol===
The living symbol of Smokey Bear was a five-pound, three-month-old American black bear cub who was found in the spring of 1950 after the Capitan Gap fire, a wildfire that burned in the Capitan Mountains of New Mexico. Smokey had climbed a tree to escape the blaze, yet his paws and hind legs had been burned.
At first he was called Hotfoot Teddy, but he was later renamed Smokey, after the character created a few years prior. Ranger Ray Bell of the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish heard about the cub and took him to Santa Fe. Bell, his wife Ruth, and their children, Don and Judy, cared for the little bear with the help of local veterinarian Dr. Edwin J. Smith. The story was picked up by the national news services and Smokey became a celebrity. Many people wrote and called asking about the cub&#x27;s recovery. The state game warden wrote to the chief of the US Forest Service, offering to present the cub to the agency as long as the cub would be dedicated to a conservation and wildfire prevention publicity program. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary for Homer C. Pickens, then assistant director of the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, he kept the cub on his property for a while before flying with the bear to D.C. Soon after, Smokey was flown in a Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser airplane to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. A special room was prepared for him at the Saint Louis Zoo for an overnight fuel stop during the trip, and when he arrived at the National Zoo on June 27, 1950, several hundred spectators, including members of the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, photographers, and media, were there to welcome him.

Smokey Bear lived at the National Zoo for 26 years. During that time he received millions of visitors and so many letters addressed to him (more than 13,000 a week) that in 1964 the United States Postal Service gave him his own ZIP Code (20252), which is still in use. He developed a love for peanut butter sandwiches in addition to his daily diet of bluefish and trout.

In 1962, Smokey was paired with a female bear, &quot;Goldie Bear,&quot; with the hope that perhaps Smokey&#x27;s descendants would take over the Smokey Bear title. In 1971, when the pair still had not produced any young, the zoo added &quot;Little Smokey,&quot; another orphaned bear cub from the Lincoln Forest, to their cage—announcing that the pair had &quot;adopted&quot; this cub.

On May 2, 1975, Smokey Bear officially &quot;retired&quot; from his role as living icon, and the title &quot;Smokey Bear II&quot; was bestowed upon Little Smokey in an official ceremony. Little Smokey died August 11, 1990.

Upon the death of the original bear on November 9, 1976, his remains were returned by the government to Capitan, New Mexico, and buried at Smokey Bear Historical Park, operated by the New Mexico State Forestry Division. The facility is now a wildfire and Smokey interpretive center. The bear is interred in the adjacent garden. The plaque at his grave reads, &quot;This is the resting place of the first living Smokey Bear ... the living symbol of wildfire prevention and wildlife conservation.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran a semi-humorous obituary for Smokey, labeled &quot;Bear,&quot; calling him a transplanted New Mexico native who had resided for many years in Washington, D.C., with many years of government service. It also mentioned his family, including his wife, Goldie Bear, and &quot;adopted son,&quot; Little Smokey. The obituary noted that Smokey and Goldie were not blood-relatives, despite the fact that they shared the same &quot;last name&quot; of &quot;Bear.&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; included an obituary for Smokey Bear on the front page of the paper on November 11, 1976. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published one as well; in fact, so many newspapers published articles and obituaries that the National Zoo archives include four complete scrapbooks devoted to them (Series 12, boxes 66–67).

===Peak in popularity===

Smokey quickly became a part of American popular culture, appearing on radio programs, in comic strips, in cartoons, and as merchandise. Knickerbocker Bears acquired the license to produce Smokey Bear dolls in 1944. In 1949, Forest Service worker Rudy Wendelin became the campaign&#x27;s full-time artist and was considered Smokey Bear&#x27;s &quot;manager&quot; until Wendelin retired in 1973.

By 1952, because Smokey Bear had attracted considerable commercial interest, the United States Congress passed the Smokey Bear Act to remove the character from the public domain and place it under the control of the United States Secretary of Agriculture. The act provided that Smokey&#x27;s royalties would be used to fund education about wildfire prevention.

In 1939, after local high school students helped fight a forest fire in the Black Hills, Hill City High School in South Dakota became the only school district in the United States authorized to use Smokey Bear as their mascot.

A Smokey Bear doll was produced by Ideal Toy Company beginning in 1952; the doll included a mail-in card for children to enable them to sign up to be designated Junior Forest Rangers. Children could also apply by writing to the U.S. Forest Service or Smokey Bear at his ZIP Code. Within three years, half a million children had applied. Also in 1952, songwriters Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins produced a successful song, titled &quot;Smokey the Bear,&quot; and performed by Eddy Arnold. The pair said that the word &quot;the&quot; was added to Smokey&#x27;s name to keep the song&#x27;s rhythm. During the 1950s, that variant of the name became widespread both in popular speech and in print, including in at least one standard encyclopedia, even though Smokey Bear&#x27;s name was never officially changed. A 1955 book in the Little Golden Books series was called &quot;Smokey the Bear,&quot; and he calls himself by this name in the book. It depicted him as an orphaned cub rescued in the aftermath of a forest fire, loosely following the true story of the bear who had been chosen as Smokey&#x27;s &quot;living symbol&quot;. This was the first book about him, and it was followed by many sequels and coloring books. Soon, thousands of dolls, toys, and other collectibles were on the market.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the Ad Council sponsored radio advertisements featuring Smokey Bear &quot;in conversation&quot; with prominent American celebrities such as Bing Crosby, Art Linkletter, Dinah Shore and Roy Rogers. Smokey&#x27;s name and image are used for the &quot;Smokey Bear Awards&quot;, which are awarded by the U.S. Forest Service, the National Association of State Foresters (NASF) and the Ad Council, to &quot;recognize outstanding service in the prevention of human-caused wildfires and to increase public recognition and awareness of the need for continuing fire prevention efforts&quot;.

The face of Smokey Bear occasionally appeared (usually on jumpers) in some episodes of the Canadian television series The Forest Rangers.

In 1959, a 14-foot-tall animatronic version of Smokey Bear was unveiled at the Ohio State Fairgrounds in Columbus, Ohio, at the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Natural Resources Park. It was installed to help teach fire prevention to children and their families. In 2015, it was replaced by a new Smokey Bear version in the same location. Both iterations of the animatronic figure have asked visitors to take the pledge to &quot;never, ever play with matches or leave any fire unattended&quot;.

The Beach Boys quote Smokey Bear in their 1964 song &quot;Drive-In&quot;: &quot;If you say you watch the movie you&#x27;re a couple of liars / and &#x27;Remember only you can prevent forest fires&#x27;&quot;. Though Smokey was originally drawn wearing the campaign hat of the U.S. Forest Service, the hat alone later became famous by association with the Smokey cartoon character. Today, it is sometimes called a &quot;Smokey Bear hat&quot; and is still used by the U.S. Forest Service, some branches of the military, and the state police.

===Recent history===
For Smokey&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 1984, he was honored with a U.S. postage stamp, illustrated by Rudy Wendelin, that pictured a cub hanging onto a burned tree. The same year, the U.S. Forest Service began to transfer Smokey Bear materials that had been collected from the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Campaign to the National Agricultural Library to be maintained in their special collections as documentation of the program. The National Archives and Records Administration transferred their materials concerning Smokey to the National Agricultural Library&#x27;s special collections in 1990. The library continues to accept and maintain donations from various Forest Service offices. The collection consists of posters, proofs, mechanicals, original artwork, motion pictures, sound recordings, and various pieces of memorabilia, some of which are available online; all the pieces are accessible in Beltsville, MD, through the library.

The commercial for his 50th anniversary portrayed woodland animals about to have a surprise birthday party for Smokey, including a cake with candles. Smokey comes blindfolded, smells smoke and not realizing the source is his birthday candles, he uses his shovel to destroy the cake. When he takes off his blindfold, he sees that it was a birthday cake for him and apologizes. That same year, a poster of the bear with a cake full of extinguished candles was issued. It reads &quot;Make Smokey&#x27;s Birthday Wish Come True&quot;.

In 2004, Smokey&#x27;s 60th anniversary was celebrated in several ways, including a Senate resolution designating August 9, 2004, as &quot;Smokey Bear&#x27;s 60th Anniversary&quot;, requesting that the President issue a proclamation &quot;calling upon the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities&quot;. According to Richard Earle, author of &quot;The Art of Cause Marketing&quot;, the Smokey Bear campaign is among the most powerful and enduring of all public service advertising:&quot;Smokey is simple, strong, straightforward. He&#x27;s a denizen of those woods you&#x27;re visiting, and he cares about preserving them. Anyone who grew up watching &quot;Bambi&quot; realizes how terrifying a forest fire can be. But Smokey wouldn&#x27;t run away. Smokey&#x27;s strong. He&#x27;ll stay and fight the fire if necessary, but he&#x27;d rather have you douse it and cover it up so he doesn&#x27;t have to.&quot;In 2011, the campaign launched its first mobile application, or app, to provide critical information about wildfire prevention, including a step-by-step guide to safely building and extinguishing campfires, as well as a map of current wildfires across America.

In 2012, NASA, the U.S. Forest Service, the Texas Forest Service and Smokey Bear teamed up to celebrate Smokey&#x27;s 68th birthday at NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center in Houston. The popular mascot toured the center and recorded a promotional announcement for NASA Television. NASA astronaut Joe Acaba and the Expedition 31 crew chose a plush Smokey doll to be the team&#x27;s launch mascot, celebrating their trip to the International Space Station. During his tour about 250 miles above Earth, Smokey turned 68 years old.

In 2014, the campaign celebrated Smokey&#x27;s 70th birthday, with new birthday-themed television, radio, print, outdoor, and digital PSAs that continued the 2013 campaign &quot;Smokey Bear Hug&quot;. The campaign depicted Smokey rewarding his followers with a hug, in acknowledgement of using the proper actions to prevent wildfires. In return, outdoor–loving individuals across the nation were shown reciprocating with a birthday bear hug in honor of his 70 years of service. Audiences were encouraged to join in by posting their own #SmokeyBearHug online. The campaign also did a partnership with Disney&#x27;s &quot;Planes&quot; that same year. In 2016, the campaign launched a new series of PSAs that aimed to increase awareness about less commonly known ways that wildfires can start. The new &quot;Rise from the Ashes&quot; campaign featured art by Bill Fink, who used wildfire ashes as an artistic medium to illustrate the devastation caused by wildfires and highlight less obvious wildfire causes. In 2017, the campaign launched new videos and artwork inspired by Smokey Bear posters to continue to raise awareness of lesser-known wildfire starts. The new artwork was created by Brian Edward Miller, Evan Hecox, Janna Mattia, and Victoria Ying, portraying Smokey Bear in each of their unique styles.

For his 75th birthday in 2019, the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Zoo in Washington D.C. opened an outdoor exhibit on May 23, 2019. Fourteen posters and multiple archival photographs of the original bear line the pathway in front of Smokey Bear&#x27;s original habitat. At the entrance stands a 6-foot-tall statue of his cartoon persona. Along with the exhibit, new commercials and promotional materials were released, and events were held throughout the U.S. The NAL showcased movies, commercials, and paintings at their Beltsville location, materials were loaned to government agencies, and materials were provided to travel to various National Forests across the country throughout 2019.

On August 1, 2019, Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles released a Smokey Bear License Plate, just a few days before Smokey Bear&#x27;s 75th birthday. The plate was sponsored by Keep Oregon Green, and costs an extra $40 per registration period, $35 of which goes to Keep Oregon Green.

== Commercialization and cultural impact ==
Use of the Smokey Bear symbol in popular culture is often unauthorized. Clothing, accessories, and memorabilia depicting Smokey Bear are common in American fashion and culture. The chief of the Forest Service can authorize use of the Smokey Bear symbol for noncommercial educational purposes, and for &quot;the commercial manufacture, importation, reproduction, or use of Smokey Bear upon the following findings: (1) That the use to which the article or published material involving Smokey Bear is to be put shall contribute to public information concerning the prevention of forest fires. (2) That the proposed use is consistent with the status of Smokey Bear as the symbol of forest fire prevention and does not in any way detract from such status. (3) That a use or royalty charge which is reasonably related to the commercial enterprise has been established. (c) Such other conditions shall be included as the Chief deems necessary in particular cases.&quot;

Some state police forces are nicknamed &quot;Smokeys&quot; (particularly by truck drivers) because their patrolmen wear the same type of campaign hat that Smokey Bear does.

==Voice portrayal==
Washington, D.C., radio station WMAL personality Jackson Weaver served as the primary voice representing Smokey until Weaver&#x27;s death in October 1992. Dallas McKennon voiced Smokey in the 1957 &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; short film, &quot;Red Riding Hoodlum&quot;. George Walsh voiced Smokey in the 1960 animated short film, &quot;Smokey the Bear and the Little Boy&quot;. After Weaver&#x27;s death, Gene Moss took over the role and voiced him until his death in 2002. In later years, Smokey has also been voiced by Roger C. Carmel (1969–1986), Jim Cummings (1993–2008), and Jack Angel (2002–2012). Frank Welker also briefly voiced Smokey in a few commercials. In June 2008, the Forest Service launched a new series of public service announcements voiced by actor Sam Elliott, simultaneously giving Smokey a new visual design intended to appeal to young adults. (coincidentally, Elliott was born on the very same day that Smokey was created). In celebration of Smokey&#x27;s 75th birthday in 2019, public service announcements featuring emoji-based versions of the character were introduced, with the voices of Stephen Colbert, Jeff Foxworthy, and Al Roker. In 2024, in celebration of Smokey&#x27;s 80th birthday, actor Brian Tyree Henry took over as the new voice.

==Adaptations==
Smokey Bear—and parodies of the character—have been appearing in animation for more than fifty years. In 1956, Smokey made a cameo appearance in the Walt Disney short film &quot;In the Bag&quot; with a voice provided by Jackson Weaver. Rankin/Bass Productions, in cooperation with Tadahito Mochinaga&#x27;s MOM Production in Japan, produced an &quot;Animagic&quot; stop-motion animated television special, &quot;Ballad of Smokey the Bear&quot;, narrated by James Cagney. It was broadcast on Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1966, as part of the &quot;General Electric Fantasy Hour&quot; on NBC. The same day, a Smokey Bear balloon was featured in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, and it was advertised as &quot;Thanksgiving is Smokey Bear Day on NBC TV&quot;.

During the 1969–1970 television season, Rankin/Bass also produced a weekly Saturday Morning cartoon series for ABC, called &quot;The Smokey Bear Show&quot;. This series was animated by Toei Animation in Japan.

Despite his real name being Smokey Bear, the name &quot;Smokey the Bear&quot; has been perpetuated in popular culture. Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins&#x27; song &quot;Smokey the Bear&quot; has been covered by the group Canned Heat, among others. The track is on their CD &quot;The Boogie House Tapes 1969–1999&quot;.

The online battle royale game &quot;Fortnite: Battle Royale&quot; parodies Smokey and his motto in a loading screen featuring Cuddle Team Leader, a woman dressed in a teddy bear costume replacing Smokey and doing his signature finger-pointing pose. Below her is the message &quot;Only YOU can prevent V-Buck scams&quot;, warning players not to risk security compromises by attempting to obtain free virtual currency offered by hackers as bait.

Smokey is briefly mentioned in the 2015 Sony Pictures Animation film &quot;Open Season: Scared Silly&quot;, when Eliot the Deer mentions Smokey being one of his favorite bears.

==Slogan==

Although the goal of reducing human-caused wildfires has never changed, the tagline of the Smokey Bear campaign was adjusted in the 2000s, from &quot;Only you can prevent forest fires&quot; to &quot;Only you can prevent wildfires&quot;. The main reason was to accurately expand the category beyond just forests to include wildlands, which include grasslands. Another reason was to respond to misplaced criticism from wildfire experts, and to distinguish &#x27;bad&#x27; intentional or accidental wildfires from the needs of sustainable forests via natural &quot;good&quot; fire ecology.

Decades of fire suppression and lack of indigenous fire ecology can contribute to dense forests with a lot of understory &quot;fuel&quot; and many dead standing trees. When a forest fire eventually does occur, the increased fuel creates a crown fire, which destroys all vegetation and affects surface soil chemistry. Although such fires have been occurring sporadically for 100 million years, and are part of the natural ecological rhythm of forests, frequent and small &quot;natural&quot; ground fires do prevent the accumulation of fuel and allow large, slow-growing vegetation, &quot;e.g.&quot;, trees, to survive.

Periodic low-intensity wildfires are also an integral component of certain ecosystems that evolved to take advantage of natural fires, such as Douglas fir, chaparral and closed-cone conifer forest habitats, which need fire for cones to open and seeds to sprout, and germinate and grow better in open burn sites. Wildfires also play a role in the preservation of pine barrens, which are well adapted to small ground fires and rely on periodic fires to remove competing species.

SmokeyBear.com&#x27;s current site has a section on &quot;Benefits of Fire&quot; that includes this information: &quot;Fire managers can reintroduce fire into fire-dependent ecosystems with prescribed fire. Under specific, controlled conditions, the beneficial effects of natural fire can be recreated, fuel buildup can be reduced, and we can prevent the catastrophic losses of uncontrolled, unwanted wildfire.&quot; Prescribed or controlled fire is an important resource management tool. It is a way to efficiently and safely provide for fire&#x27;s natural role in the ecosystem. However, the goal of Smokey Bear will always be to reduce the number of human-caused wildfires and reduce the loss of resources, homes and lives.

<text>The Diamond Sutra (Sanskrit: &quot;Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;) is a Mahāyāna Buddhist sutra (a kind of holy scripture) from the genre of &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot; (&#x27;perfection of wisdom&#x27;) sutras. Translated into a variety of languages over a broad geographic range, the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; is one of the most influential Mahayana sutras in East Asia, and it is particularly prominent within the Chan (or Zen) tradition, along with the &quot;Heart Sutra&quot;.

A copy of the Tang dynasty–Chinese version of the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; was found among the Dunhuang manuscripts in 1900 by Daoist monk Wang Yuanlu and sold to Aurel Stein in 1907. They are dated back to 11 May 868. 
The Chinese Diamond Sutra was printed in 868, and the ‘Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong’ was printed in 751. The oldest surviving printed work is the ‘Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong’, printed by woodblock in Korea around 751.

It is also the first known creative work with an explicit public domain dedication, as its colophon at the end states that it was created &quot;for universal free distribution&quot;.

==Title==
The Sanskrit title for the sūtra is the &quot;Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;,
which may be translated roughly as the &quot;Vajra Cutter Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra&quot; or &quot;The Perfection of Wisdom Text that Cuts Like a Thunderbolt&quot;. In English, shortened forms such as &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; and &quot;Vajra Sūtra&quot; are common. The title relies on the power of the vajra (diamond or thunderbolt, but also an abstract term for a powerful weapon) to cut things as a metaphor for the type of wisdom that cuts and shatters illusions to get to ultimate reality. The sutra is also called by the name &quot;Triśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; (300 lines on the Perfection of Wisdom sutra).

The &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; is highly regarded in East Asian countries with traditions of Mahayana Buddhism. Translations of this title into the languages of some of these countries include:

==History==
The exact date of the composition of the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; in Sanskrit is uncertain—arguments for the 2nd and 5th centuries have been made. The first Chinese translation dates to the early 5th century, but, by this point, the 4th or 5th century monks Asanga and Vasubandhu seem to have already authored authoritative commentaries on its content.The Vajracchedika sutra was an influential work in the Mahayana Buddhist tradition. Early translations into a number of languages have been found in locations across Central and East Asia, suggesting that the text was widely studied and translated. In addition to Chinese translations, translations of the text and commentaries were made into Tibetan, and translations, elaborations, and paraphrases survive in a number of Central Asian languages.

The first translation of the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; into Chinese is thought to have been made in 401 by the venerated and prolific translator Kumārajīva. Kumārajīva&#x27;s translation style is distinctive, possessing a flowing smoothness that reflects his prioritization on conveying the meaning as opposed to precise literal rendering. The Kumārajīva translation has been particularly highly regarded over the centuries, and it is this version that appears on the 868 Dunhuang scroll. It is the most widely used and chanted Chinese version.

In addition to the Kumārajīva translation, a number of later translations exist. The &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; was again translated from Sanskrit into Chinese by Bodhiruci (the one from North India) in 509, Paramārtha in 558, Dharmagupta (twice, in 590 and in 605~616), Xuanzang (twice, in 648 and in 660~663), Bodhiruci (the one from South India) in 693, and Yijing in 703.

The Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang visited a Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda monastery at Bamiyan, Afghanistan, in the 7th century. Using Xuanzang&#x27;s travel accounts, modern archaeologists have identified the site of this monastery. Birchbark manuscript fragments of several Mahāyāna sūtras have been discovered at the site, including the &quot;Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; (MS 2385), and these are now part of the Schøyen Collection. This manuscript was written in the Sanskrit language, and written in an ornate form of the Gupta script. This same Sanskrit manuscript also contains the &quot;Medicine Buddha Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Bhaiṣajyaguruvaiḍūryaprabhārāja Sūtra&quot;).
The &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; gave rise to a culture of artwork, sūtra veneration, and commentaries in East Asian Buddhism. By the end of the Tang dynasty (907) in China there were over 80 commentaries written on it (only 32 survive), such as those by prominent Chinese Buddhists like Sengzhao, Xie Lingyun, Zhiyi, Jizang, Kuiji and Zongmi. Copying and recitation of the &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot; was a widespread devotional practice, and stories attributing miraculous powers to these acts are recorded in Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan, and Mongolian sources.

One of the best known commentaries is the &quot;Exegesis on the Diamond Sutra&quot; by Huineng, the Sixth Patriarch of the Chan School. The &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot; features prominently in the 1st chapter of the Platform Sutra, the religious biography of Huineng, where hearing its recitation is supposed to have triggered the enlightening insight that led Huineng to abandon his life as a woodcutter to become a Buddhist monk.

== Contents ==

The &quot;Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sutra&quot; contains the discourse of the Buddha to a senior monk, Subhuti. Its major themes are anatman (not-self), the emptiness of all phenomena (though the term &#x27;śūnyatā&#x27; itself does not appear in the text), the liberation of all beings without attachment and the importance of spreading and teaching the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; itself. In his commentary on the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot;, Hsing Yun describes the four main points from the sūtra as giving without attachment to self, liberating beings without notions of self and other, living without attachment, and cultivating without attainment. According to Shigenori Nagatomo, the major goal of the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; is: &quot;an existential project aiming at achieving and embodying a non-discriminatory basis for knowledge&quot; or &quot;the emancipation from the fundamental ignorance of not knowing how to experience reality as it is&quot;.

In the sūtra, the Buddha has finished his daily walk to Sravasti with the monks to gather offerings of food, and he sits down to rest. Elder Subhūti comes forth and asks the Buddha: &quot;How, Lord, should one who has set out on the bodhisattva path take his stand, how should he proceed, how should he control the mind?&quot;
What follows is a dialogue regarding the nature of the &quot;perfection of insight&quot; (&quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot;) and the nature of ultimate reality (which is illusory and empty). The Buddha begins by answering Subhuti by stating that he will bring all living beings to final nirvana (extinction, blowout), but that after this &quot;no living being whatsoever has been brought to extinction&quot;. This is because a bodhisattva does not see beings through reified concepts such as &quot;person&quot;, &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;self&quot;, but sees them through the lens of perfect understanding, as empty of inherent, unchanging self.

The Buddha continues his exposition with similar statements which use negation to point out the emptiness of phenomena, merit, the Dharma (Buddha&#x27;s teaching), the stages of enlightenment and the Buddha himself. Japanese Buddhologist Hajime Nakamura calls this negation the &quot;logic of not&quot; (&quot;na prthak&quot;). Further examples of the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; via negativa include statements such as:
* &quot;As far as &#x27;all dharmas&#x27; are concerned, Subhuti, all of them are dharma-less. That is why they are called &#x27;all dharmas&#x27;.&quot;
* &quot;Those so-called &#x27;streams of thought&#x27;, Subhuti, have been preached by the Tathagata as streamless. That is why they are called &#x27;streams of thought&#x27;.&quot;
* All beings&#x27;, Subhuti, have been preached by the Tathagata as beingless. That is why they are called &#x27;all beings&#x27;.&quot;

The Buddha is generally thought to be trying to help Subhūti unlearn his preconceived, limited notions of the nature of reality. Emphasizing that all phenomena are ultimately illusory, he teaches that true enlightenment cannot be grasped until one has set aside attachment to them in any form.

Another reason why the Buddha makes use of negation is that language reifies concepts and this can lead to attachment to those concepts, but true wisdom is seeing that nothing is fixed or stable, hence according to the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; thoughts such as &quot;I have obtained the state of an Arhat&quot; or &quot;I will bring living beings to nirvana&quot; do not even occur in an enlightened one&#x27;s mind because this would be &quot;seizing upon a self ... seizing upon a living being, seizing upon a soul, seizing upon a person&quot;.

The sutra goes on to state that anyone who says such things should not be called a bodhisattva. According to David Kalupahana the goal of the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; is &quot;one colossal attempt to avoid the extremist use of language, that is, to eliminate any ontological commitment to concepts while at the same time retaining their pragmatic value, so as not to render them totally empty of meaning&quot;.

Kalupahana explains the negation of the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; by seeing an initial statement as an erroneous affirmation of substance or selfhood, which is then critiqued (all dharmas&#x27; are dharmaless&quot;), and then finally reconstructed (&quot;that is why they are called &#x27;all dharmas) as being conventional and dependently originated. Kalupahana explains this final reconstruction as meaning: &quot;that each concept, instead of either representing a unique entity or being an empty term, is a substitute for a human experience which is conditioned by a variety of factors. As such, it has pragmatic meaning and communicative power without being absolute in any way.&quot; According to Paul Harrison, the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; central argument here is that &quot;all dharmas lack a self or essence, or to put it in other words, they have no core ontologically, they only appear to exist separately and independently by the power of conventional language, even though they are in fact dependently originated&quot;.

The mind of someone who practices the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot; or &quot;perfection of wisdom&quot; is then a mind free from fixed substantialist or &quot;self&quot; concepts:

Throughout the teaching, the Buddha repeats that successful memorization and elucidation of even a four-line extract of it is of incalculable merit, better than giving an entire world system filled with gifts and can bring about enlightenment. Section 32 (of the Chinese version) also ends with a four-line gatha:

Paul Harrison&#x27;s translation of the Sanskrit version states:

==Dunhuang block print==

There is a woodblock-printed copy of the &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot; in the British Library which, although not the earliest example of block printing, is the earliest example which bears an actual date.

The extant copy is in the form of a scroll about long. The archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein purchased it in 1907 in the walled-up Mogao Caves near Dunhuang in northwest China from a monk guarding the caves – known as the &quot;Caves of the Thousand Buddhas&quot;.

The colophon, at the inner end, reads:

In 2010 UK writer and historian Frances Wood, head of the Chinese section at the British Library, Mark Barnard, conservator at the British Library, and Ken Seddon, professor of chemistry at Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast, were involved in the restoration of its copy of the book. The British Library website allows readers to view the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; in its entirety.

<text>Mangelwurzel or mangold wurzel (from German &quot;Mangel/Mangold&quot;, &quot;chard&quot; and &quot;Wurzel&quot;, &quot;root&quot;), also called mangold, mangel beet, field beet, fodder beet and (archaic) root of scarcity, is a cultivated root vegetable. It is a variety of &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot;, the same species that also contains the red beet (beetroot) and sugar beet varieties. The cultivar group is named Crassa Group. Their large white, yellow or orange-yellow swollen roots were developed in the 18th century as a fodder crop for feeding livestock.

==Uses==

Contemporary use is primarily for cattle, pig and other stock fodder, although it can be eaten—especially when young—by humans. Considered a crop for cool-temperate climates, the mangelwurzel sown in autumn can be grown as a winter crop in warm-temperate to subtropical climates. Both leaves and roots may be eaten. Leaves can be lightly steamed for salads or lightly boiled as a vegetable if treated like spinach or chard, which is a member of the same subspecies. Grown in well-dug, well-composted soil and watered regularly, the roots become tender, juicy, and flavourful. The roots are prepared boiled like potato for serving mashed, diced, or in sweet curries. Animals are known to thrive upon this plant; both its leaves and roots provide nutritious food. George Henderson, a 20th-century English farmer and author on agriculture, described mangel beets as one of the best fodders for dairying, as milk production is maximized.

The mangelwurzel has a history in England of being used for sport (&quot;mangold hurling&quot;), for celebration, for animal fodder, and for the brewing of a potent alcoholic beverage. The 1830 Scottish cookbook &quot;The Practice of Cookery&quot; includes a recipe for a beer made with mangelwurzel. In 19th-century American usage, mangel beets were sometimes referred to as &quot;mango&quot;.

During the Irish Famine (1845–1852), Poor Law Guardians in Galway City leased (on a 999-year-lease) an former nunnery to house 1,000 orphaned or deserted boys ages from five to about 15. Here, the boys were taught tailoring, shoe making, and agricultural skills. On a plot, they grew potatoes, cabbage, parsnips, carrots, onions, Swedish turnips, and &quot;mangold wurtzel&quot;, both for workhouse consumption and for a cash crop.

Mangelwurzels are used in dairy cows as winter food, especially in New Zealand. Veterinarians used to believe that the plant contains too much oxalate for cattle to eat, but farmers found that very high amounts of grazed manglewurzel killed only a very small portion of cows, with the rest thriving. It is now known that these deaths were due to rumen acidosis and had nothing to do with oxalate. Safer protocols to transition cows onto mangelwurzel feed were then provided, making the entire process quite safe.

As with most foods, subsisting on solely one crop can produce dietary deficiency. The food shortages in Europe after World War I caused great hardships, including cases of mangel-wurzel disease, as relief workers called it. It was a consequence of eating only beets.

== Growing requirements ==
In general, mangelwurzel are easy to grow. They may require supplementary potassium for optimum yields, flavour, and texture, and foliage readily displays potassium deficiency as interveinal chlorosis. This can be corrected with either organic or inorganic sources of potash.

Mangelwurzel is very susceptible to damage from frost. It is suited to southern parts of England where the climate is too warm and dry for the successful cultivation of turnip.

==In tradition==
In South Somerset, on the last Thursday of October every year, Punkie Night is celebrated. Children carry around lanterns called &quot;Punkies&quot;, which are hollowed-out mangelwurzels. Mangelwurzels also are, or previously were, carved out for Halloween in Norfolk, Wales, parts of Yorkshire and northwest Cumberland (Workington) and Devon.

John Le Marchant, a British Army cavalry officer and swords instructor, recommended cutting the &quot;mangel-wurzel&quot; to learn the proper mechanics for a draw cut with the broadsword in his historic manual on swordsmanship.

In an early article in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, Thompson A and Minx M cite Mangelwurzel seeds as an effective relief for constipation when taken &quot;per anum&quot; (through the anus) after scoring the husk.

Mangelwurzel seeds were sent by Benjamin Rush to George Washington.

<doc id="329806" wikidata="Q350834" url="?curid=329806" title="Sleight of hand">
<text>Sleight of hand (also known as prestidigitation or legerdemain ()) refers to fine motor skills when used by performing artists in different art forms to entertain or manipulate. It is closely associated with close-up magic, card magic, card flourishing and stealing. Because of its heavy use and practice by magicians, sleight of hand is often confused as a branch of magic; however, it is a separate genre of entertainment and many artists practice sleight of hand as an independent skill. Sleight of hand pioneers with worldwide acclaim include Dan and Dave, Ricky Jay, Derek DelGaudio, David Copperfield, Yann Frisch, Norbert Ferré, Dai Vernon, Jerry Sadowitz, Cardini, Tony Slydini, Helder Guimarães and Tom Mullica.

==Etymology and history==

The word &quot;sleight&quot;, meaning &quot;the use of dexterity or cunning, especially so as to deceive&quot;, comes from the Old Norse. The phrase &quot;sleight of hand&quot; means &quot;quick fingers&quot; or &quot;trickster fingers&quot;. Common synonyms of Latin and French include &quot;prestidigitation&quot; and &quot;legerdemain&quot; respectively. Seneca the Younger, philosopher of the Silver Age of Latin literature, famously compared rhetorical techniques and illusionist techniques.

===Association with close-up magic===

Sleight of hand is often used in close-up magic, where the sleights are performed with the audience close to the magician, usually in physical contact or within . This close contact eliminates theories of fake audience members and the use of s. It makes use of everyday items as props, such as cards, coins, rubber bands, paper, phones and even saltshakers. A well-performed sleight looks like an ordinary, natural and completely innocent gesture, change in hand position or body posture. In addition to manual dexterity, sleight of hand in close-up magic depends on the use of psychology, timing, misdirection, and natural choreography in accomplishing a magical effect.

===Association with stage magic===

Sleight of hand during stage magic performances is not common, as most magic events and stunts are performed with objects visible to a much larger audience, but is nevertheless done occasionally by many stage performers. The most common magic tricks performed with sleight of hand on stage are rope manipulations and card tricks, with the first typically being done with a member of the audience to rule out the possibility of stooges and the latter primarily being done on a table while a camera is live-recording, allowing the rest of the audience to see the performance on a big screen. Worldwide acclaimed stage magician David Copperfield often includes illusions featuring sleight of hand in his stage shows.

===Association with card cheating===

Although being mostly used for entertainment and comedy purposes, sleight of hand is also notoriously used to cheat at casinos and gambling facilities throughout the world. Common ways to professionally cheat at card games using sleight of hand include palming, switching, ditching, and stealing cards from the table. Such techniques involve extreme misdirection and years of practice. For these reasons, the term &quot;sleight of hand&quot; frequently carries negative associations of dishonesty and deceit at many gambling halls, and many magicians known around the world are publicly banned from casinos, such as British mentalist and close-up magician Derren Brown, who is banned from every casino in Britain.

===Association with cardistry===

Unlike card tricks done on the streets or on stage and card cheating, cardistry is solely about impressing without illusions, deceit, misdirection and other elements commonly used in card tricks and card cheating. Cardistry is the art of card flourishing, and is intended to be visually impressive and to give the appearance of being difficult to perform. Card flourishing is often associated with card tricks, but many sleight of hand artists perform flourishing without considering themselves magicians or having any real interest in card tricks.

===Association with card throwing===

The art of card throwing generally consists of throwing standard playing cards with excessively high speed and accuracy, powerful enough to slice fruits like carrots and even melons. Like flourishing, throwing cards is meant to be visibly impressive and does not include magic elements. Magician Ricky Jay popularized throwing cards within the sleight of hand industry with the release of his 1977 book &quot;Cards as Weapons&quot;, which was met with large sales and critical acclaim. Some magic tricks, both close-up and on stage, are heavily connected to throwing cards.

<text>Garrett Mattingly (May 6, 1900 – December 18, 1962) was a professor of European history at Columbia University who specialized in early modern diplomatic history. In 1960 he won a Pulitzer Prize for &quot;The Defeat of the Spanish Armada&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born in Washington, D.C., Mattingly attended elementary school in Washington and public high school in Michigan after his family moved to Kalamazoo in 1913. Following graduation, Mattingly served, 1918-1919, as a sergeant in the U. S. Army. He then earned an A. B. summa cum laude at Harvard University (1923) and, while still an undergraduate, studied in France at Strasbourg and Paris and in Florence, Italy. After two years spent working in a New York City publishing house he received his M.A. in history at Harvard (1926) and began his academic career at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, teaching history and literature. There he formed a close personal and professional friendship with writer Bernard DeVoto.

Mattingly completed his PhD at Harvard in 1935, having developed a strong interest in the sixteenth century and coming under the influence of Roger B. Merriman, a specialist in the history of the Spanish Empire. Aided by a Guggenheim Fellowship—of which he was a four-time winner—he spent the academic year 1937-1938 doing intensive research in European archives. In order to read the primary sources, Mattingly taught himself several foreign languages as well as sixteenth-century script.

==Academic career==
Mattingly&#x27;s first book was the biography, &quot;Catherine of Aragon&quot; (1941), a book &quot;extremely careful and accurate and enormously erudite&quot; but with traces of the care, accuracy and erudition &quot;carefully concealed or utterly obliterated.&quot; The book was chosen as a selection of the Literary Guild.

During World War II Mattingly served in the U.S. Naval Reserve as a lieutenant commander, but he spent most of his service in Washington, D.C., instructing intelligence officers. In the process, Mattingly learned much about naval operations that would later prove useful writing a best-seller about the Armada. Following the war Mattingly, disappointed in not attaining a Harvard appointment, found a position in the adult program of Cooper Union in New York City, where he &quot;perfected his dramatic style of lecturing.&quot; In 1947 Mattingly joined the department of history at Columbia University where he spent the remainder of his career and was appointed William R. Shepherd Professor of European History in 1959. His lectures at Columbia were popular both for their learning and their sprightly presentation. A friend, Leo Gershoy, recalled that Mattingly lectured with head &quot;cocked, eyes sparkling, his smile benign, he talked in a flow of words, witty, gay, and serious, about poetry and drama and novels, about music he loved dearly, about tapestries and paintings he admired, about rich wines and fine food that few appreciated with equal discrimination. He loved, too, to talk about explorers whose voyages he could so fully trace, and about sailing ships, how they were built and manned and how navigated.&quot; Mattingly treated his job as a historian &quot;as that of telling a story about people&quot; and he had &quot;a wide-range panoramic vision.&quot;

In 1955 Mattingly published &quot;Renaissance Diplomacy&quot;, a book that made his historical reputation. Exceptionally well researched and citing sources in six languages, Mattingly wrote it in a style both erudite and limpid. As J. H. Hexter later wrote, &quot;If any amount of skill could have made &quot;Renaissance Diplomacy&quot; a popular book, its author had the skill; but the cards were stacked against him.&quot; Nevertheless, Mattingly was so determined not to publish the book with a university press that, at his publisher&#x27;s recommendation, he cut the manuscript by a third and destroyed the original draft. &quot;It is perhaps a measure of that achievement that the &quot;Renaissance Diplomacy&quot; which historians read with such admiration is not as good as Mattingly could have made it; it is, indeed, not as good as he had made it. Even so, it remains one of the finest historical works of the past half century.&quot;

Mattingly&#x27;s most successful book was &quot;The Armada&quot; (1959). As one biographer has written, the book was &quot;written in purple prose but a royal purple, which read like historical fiction.&quot; Hailed enthusiastically by critics, the book was a bestseller as both Book-of-the-Month Club and History Book Club selections. Mattingly also won a special Pulitzer Prize for the work. He was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

==Critical assessment==
Although a mild &quot;Norman Thomas socialist&quot; in politics, Mattingly had a &quot;low tolerance for ideologies&quot; both political and professional. He once joked that he was an old-fashioned literary historian like &quot;Will Durant, Irving Fisher and William Hickling Prescott.&quot;

==Marriage and later years==
Mattingly married Gertrude L. McCollum, a teacher, in 1928; the couple had no children. Although his health had been poor for several previous years, Mattingly died unexpectedly of emphysema in 1962 while serving as George Eastman Visiting Professor at Oxford University.

<doc id="329820" wikidata="Q4051372" url="?curid=329820" title="The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald">
<text>&quot;The Wreck of the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; is a 1976 hit song written, composed and performed by the Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot to memorialize the sinking of the bulk carrier SS &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; in Lake Superior on November 10, 1975. Lightfoot considered this song to be his finest work.

Appearing originally on his 1976 album &quot;Summertime Dream&quot;, Lightfoot re-recorded the song in 1988 for the compilation album &quot;Gord&#x27;s Gold, Vol. 2&quot;.

==Lyrics==
The song chronicles the final voyage of the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; as it succumbed to a massive late-season storm and sank in Lake Superior with the loss of all 29 crewmen. Lightfoot drew inspiration from news reports he gathered in the immediate aftermath, particularly &quot;The Cruelest Month&quot;, published in &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine&#x27;s November 24, 1975, issue. Lightfoot&#x27;s passion for recreational sailing on the Great Lakes informs his ballad&#x27;s verses throughout.

Recorded before the ship&#x27;s wreckage could be examined, the song contains some artistic conjectures, omissions and paraphrases. In later interviews, Lightfoot recounted how he had agonized over possible inaccuracies while trying to pen the lyrics until his lead guitarist Terry Clements convinced him to do what Clements&#x27; favourite author Mark Twain would have advised: just tell a story.

In March 2010, Lightfoot changed a line during live performances to reflect new findings that there had been no crew error involved in the sinking. The line originally read, &quot;At 7 p.m. a main hatchway caved in; he said...&quot;; Lightfoot began singing it as &quot;At 7 p.m. it grew dark, it was then he said...&quot; Lightfoot learned about the new research when contacted for permission to use his song for a History Channel documentary that aired on March 31, 2010. Lightfoot stated that he had no intention of changing the original copyrighted lyrics; instead, from then on, he simply sang the new words during live performances.
==Melody==
The melody for the song was later adapted by Bobby Sands for his song &quot;Back Home in Derry&quot;. When asked about the similarity and why he didn&#x27;t pursue copyright infringement, Lightfoot said that the melody was &quot;just an old Irish folk song; an old Irish dirge. I think I took it from that. It&#x27;s all folk music and it&#x27;s all out there for everyone to enjoy.&quot;

==Production==
The song was recorded in December 1975 at Eastern Sound, a recording studio composed of two Victorian houses at 48 Yorkville Avenue in a then-hippie district of downtown Toronto. The famous studio was later torn down and replaced by a parking lot.

Pee Wee Charles and Terry Clements came up with &quot;the haunting guitar and steel riffs&quot; on a &quot;second take&quot; during the evening session.

The song was the first commercial digital multitrack recording on the 3M 32-track digital recorder – a prototype technology at the time.

==Chart success==

Lightfoot&#x27;s single version hit number 1 in his native Canada (in the &quot;RPM&quot; national singles survey) on November 20, 1976, barely a year after the disaster. In the United States, it reached number 1 in &quot;Cashbox&quot; and number 2 for two weeks in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (behind Rod Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;), making it Lightfoot&#x27;s second-most successful single, behind only &quot;Sundown&quot;. Overseas it was at best a minor hit, peaking at number 40 in the UK Singles Chart.

<text>Mammoth Spring is a large, first magnitude karst spring that arises in the Ozark Plateau within the state of Arkansas. It is the largest spring in Arkansas and the third-largest spring within the Ozark Plateau region behind Big Spring and Greer Spring. Mammoth Spring is the seventh-largest natural spring in the world.

The spring&#x27;s outlet pool is contained entirely within Mammoth Spring State Park. The park is located in the town of Mammoth Spring, which lies in extreme north-central Arkansas. The outlet pool is adjacent to US Highway 63, only 500 ft. south of the Missouri border, and it can be readily seen from the highway. The spring&#x27;s large discharge volume rushes a few hundred feet down the outlet channel before merging with the Warm Fork of the Spring River to form the Spring River. The cold water that emerges from the spring creates excellent trout fishing conditions and ample flow for water sports on the Spring River. Mammoth Spring was declared a National Natural Landmark by the Department of the Interior in June 1972.

==Description==
Precipitation that falls in southern Missouri seeps into the water table and flows through a vast system of passages and cavities. These cavities form an underground river that ultimately emerges on the surface at the town of Mammoth Spring, Arkansas. The emerging water forms a 10-acre spring pool that drains over a high stone dam. The spring generates a harmonic mean flow of about 9 m³/s (322 cubic feet per second). The water emerges at a constant 14 °C (58 °F). The spring itself cannot be viewed at the Mammoth Spring site because its mouth is more than 21 m (70 ft) below the surface of the large spring pool.

Nine miles northwest of Mammoth Spring, visitors can see a portion of the underground river that feeds the spring at a collapsed cave in Grand Gulf State Park in Missouri. The remains of a portion of the cave are now a 40 m (130 ft) deep chasm with a natural bridge over it. Dye tests have proven that the water flowing through the 40 m (130 ft) chasm at Grand Gulf exits through the existing cave and emerges at Mammoth Spring.

==Industrial use==
The spring was used to power a gristmill from the times of the earliest European settlement. The Mammoth Spring Milling Company constructed a dam and a water-powered gristmill just downstream of the outlet of the spring lake. In 1925, the dam was purchased by the Arkansas-Missouri Power Company which constructed a hydroelectric plant at the dam. This plant supplied power to the surrounding area until 1972.

==Park==
In 1957, Mammoth Spring State Park was established. Surrounding land claims could not be acquired until 1972, however. Prior to 1972, the Mammoth Spring Cattle Sales Barn was co-owned and run by local entrepreneur Bert Kenneth Bishop and his associate, roughly on the site of where the Welcome Center now stands. Local farmers would routinely come to the site to sell livestock and other wares, such as Howard Green, who sold home-made walking sticks. Following this period in history, the State legislature voted to condemn the land and join the plot to the state park.
The original Frisco Depot was restored in 1971 and now functions as a repository for artifacts and memorabilia related to the railroad and the spring area. The State Park provides a visitor&#x27;s center, picnic areas, walking trails, and tour access to the dam and hydro plant.

The United States Fish and Wildlife Service maintains a fish hatchery near the spring.

<text>Mammoth Spring State Park is a Arkansas state park in Fulton County, Arkansas in the United States. The park is located surrounding National Natural Landmark of the same name to provide recreation and interpretation for visitors. The park offers fishing, boating and hiking in addition to an Arkansas Welcome Center and restored 1886 Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railroad (later the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway or &quot;Frisco&quot;) depot operating as a railroad museum. The site became a state park in 1957, but the park continued to add area until 1975.

==Mammoth Spring==
Originating in the park, Mammoth Spring averages a flow rate of per hour of water. Rainfall in southern Missouri percolates into the ground, flows through Grand Gulf State Park and reemerges as Mammoth Spring in Arkansas.

==History==

In 1887, the Mammoth Spring Improvement and Water Power Company constructed the limestone dam which created Spring Lake. This dam initially powered a flour mill, cotton mill, and cotton gin. This property was acquired in 1925 by the Arkansas-Missouri Power Company, which constructed a hydroelectric facility that was operated until 1972. The company donated this property to the state to become part of the state park. These facilities, including the lake, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Prior to 1957, the Mammoth Spring Cattle Sales Barn was co-owned and run by local entrepreneur Kenneth &quot;Bert&quot; Bishop and his associate, roughly on the site where the tourist information center now stands. Local farmers would routinely come to the site to sell livestock and other wares, such as Howard Green, who sold home-made walking sticks. Following this period in history, the State legislature voted to condemn the land and turn the spot into a state park. 1957, the park was established. The original Frisco Depot, and 1885 Victorian train station, was restored in 1971. The depot now functions as a museum, containing artifacts and memorabilia; it was listed on the National Register in 1992.

==Recreation==
The park offers a visitor center/Arkansas Welcome Center to interpret the history of the region. A short walking trail leads to the restored train depot that formerly provided a connection for the city of Mammoth Spring to the Frisco Railway. Items of historical significance from the surrounding area, including a restored caboose, are on display in the museum. The former hydroelectric plant and mill nearby allow visitors to understand the economic importance the spring had to the early development of the nearby city. A pavilion, picnic areas, baseball field, and playground are available for visitors as well. Seasonal boat rentals on Spring Lake can be obtained at the visitor center.

<doc id="329829" wikidata="Q626978" url="?curid=329829" title="Vertical blanking interval">
<text>In a raster scan display, the vertical blanking interval (VBI), also known as the vertical interval or VBLANK, is the time between the end of the final visible line of a frame or field and the beginning of the first visible line of the next frame or field. It is present in analog television, VGA, DVI and other signals. Here the term field is used in interlaced video, and the term frame is used in progressive video and there can be a VBI after each frame or field. In interlaced video a frame is made up of 2 fields. Sometimes in interlaced video a field is called a frame which can lead to confusion.

In raster cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays, the blank level is usually supplied during this period to avoid painting the retrace line—see raster scan for details; signal sources such as television broadcasts do not supply image information during the blanking period. Digital displays usually will not display incoming data stream during the blanking interval even if present.

The VBI was originally needed because of the inductive inertia of the magnetic coils which deflect the electron beam vertically in a CRT; the magnetic field, and hence the position being drawn, cannot change instantly. Additionally, the speed of older circuits was limited. For horizontal deflection, there is also a pause between successive lines, to allow the beam to return from right to left, called the horizontal blanking interval. Modern CRT circuitry does not require such a long blanking interval, and thin panel displays require none, but the standards were established when the delay was needed (and to allow the continued use of older equipment). Blanking of a CRT may not be perfect due to equipment faults or brightness set very high; in this case a white retrace line shows on the screen, often alternating between fairly steep diagonals from right to left and less-steep diagonals back from left to right, starting in the lower right of the display.

In analog television systems the vertical blanking interval can be used for datacasting (to carry digital data), since nothing sent during the VBI is displayed on the screen; various test signals, VITC timecode, closed captioning, teletext, CGMS-A copy-protection indicators, and various data encoded by the XDS protocol (e.g., the content ratings for V-chip use) and other digital data can be sent during this time period.

In U.S. analog broadcast television, line 19 was reserved for a Ghost-canceling reference and line 21 was reserved for NABTS captioning data. The obsolete Teletext service contemplated the use of line 22 for data transmission.

The pause between sending video data is sometimes used in real time computer graphics to modify the frame buffer, or to provide a time reference for when switching the source buffer for video output can happen without causing a visible tear. This is especially true in video game systems, where the fixed frequency of the blanking period might also be used to derive in-game timing.

On many consoles there is an extended blanking period, as the console opts to paint graphics on fewer lines than the television would natively allow, permitting its output to be surrounded by a border. On some very early machines such as the Atari 2600, the programmer is in full control of video output and therefore may select their own blanking period, allowing arbitrarily few painted lines. On others such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, a predefined blanking period could be extended.

Most consumer VCRs use the known black level of the vertical blanking pulse to set their recording levels. The Macrovision copy protection scheme inserts pulses in the VBI, where the recorder expects a constant level, to disrupt recording to videotapes.

== Vertical blanking interval in digital video ==

While digital video interconnects (such as DVI and HDMI) generally do have a &quot;vertical blanking&quot; part of the datastream,
they are unable to carry closed caption text or most of the other items that, in analog TV interconnects, are transmitted during the &quot;vertical blanking interval&quot;.
This can lead to .

<doc id="329830" wikidata="Q1390043" url="?curid=329830" title="Politically Incorrect">
<text>Politically Incorrect (stylized as POLITICALLY INCOrrECT) is an American late-night, half-hour political talk show hosted by Bill Maher that aired from July 25, 1993, to July 5, 2002. It premiered on Comedy Central in July 1993 and aired for three seasons until November 5, 1996; amid its success on Comedy Central, ABC expressed interest in bringing the show to the network to shore up its late-night lineup, moving there on January 5, 1997.

On September 17, 2001, Maher criticized United States foreign policy on the show and argued that the perpetrators of the September 11 terrorist attacks, &quot;although terrible people,&quot; were not cowards. &quot;What &quot;was&quot; cowardly,&quot; he argued, &quot;was America&#x27;s relationship with the rest of the world.&quot; The comments were widely condemned, and while Maher later apologized and clarified the meaning behind his comments, major advertisers stopped advertising with the show. As a result, the show was canceled in 2002.

The show first originated from New York City, but soon moved to Los Angeles. The New York episodes were shot at the CBS Broadcast Center and the Los Angeles episodes at CBS Television City, where it remained even after its move to ABC.

The first episode featured comedian Jerry Seinfeld, Howard Stern co-host Robin Quivers, Republican Party strategist Ed Rollins, and comedian Larry Miller. Frequent guests included Dave Matthews, Arianna Huffington, Michael McKean, Ann Coulter, Carrot Top, and Christine O&#x27;Donnell.

==Format==

The show began with a brief topical monologue from Maher. Then Maher introduces the guests individually, promoting their current projects. Four guests appear, usually a mix of individuals from show business, popular culture, pundits, political consultants, and occasionally regular people in the news, discussing topics in the news selected by Maher. Maher described the program as &quot;&quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; on acid.&quot;

On rare occasions, Maher would interview a single guest. The show was pioneering in mixing political figures and entertainers. Maher tried to air all points of view, especially controversial ones. Guests could be both aggravating and insightful, with the conversation similar to a cocktail party with quick-witted guests.

== Writers ==
The show&#x27;s writers included Al Franken, Arianna Huffington, Kevin Bleyer, Scott Carter, and Chris Kelly.

==9/11 controversy and cancellation==
On September 11, 2001, conservative political commentator Barbara Olson was on her way to Los Angeles to appear as a guest on &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, when the airplane she was on was hijacked and flown into the Pentagon during the September 11 attacks.

In the aftermath of the attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush said that the terrorists responsible were cowards. During the September 17, 2001 episode, one of Maher&#x27;s guests, Dinesh D&#x27;Souza, said &quot;These are warriors. And we have to realize that the principles of our way of life are in conflict with people in the world. And so - I mean, I&#x27;m all for understanding the sociological causes of this, but we should not blame the victim. Americans shouldn&#x27;t blame themselves because other people want to bomb them.&quot; Maher agreed, and replied: &quot;We have been the cowards, lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That&#x27;s cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building, say what you want about it, [it&#x27;s] not cowardly.&quot; Similar comments were made by others in other media.

Advertisers withdrew their support, and some ABC affiliates stopped airing the show temporarily. White House press secretary Ari Fleischer denounced Maher, warning that &quot;people have to watch what they say and watch what they do.&quot; Maher apologized, and explained that he had been criticizing U.S. military policy, not American soldiers.

The show was canceled the following June, which Maher and many others saw as a result of the controversy, although ABC denied that the controversy was a factor and said the program was canceled due to declining ratings. Maher said that the show struggled for advertisers in its final months. There were subsequently comments in various media on the irony that a show called &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; was canceled because its host had made a supposedly politically incorrect comment.

The show was replaced on ABC by &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; in 2003.

Maher rebounded with an hour-long weekly program on HBO called &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; premiering on February 21, 2003, which follows a similar format, with fewer guests since the coronavirus pandemic.

== Awards and recognition ==
The show won a 2000 Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video for a Series.&quot; In addition, it was nominated for seventeen other awards, including: &quot;Outstanding Variety&quot;; &quot;Outstanding Music or Comedy Series&quot; (every year from 1995 to 2002); and &quot;Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Music Program&quot; in 1997. The show also won two CableACE Awards in 1995 and 1996 for Talk Show Series and was nominated for a third in 1997. It was also nominated for two Writers Guild of America awards for best Comedy/Variety series in 2001 and 2002.

==Related media==
Maher released a book in 1997, &quot;Does Anybody Have a Problem with That? The Best of Politically Incorrect&quot;, which featured questions asked on the show, comments Maher made and guest answers. In 2003 an audiobook &quot;POLITICAL INCORRECTIONS: The Best Opening Monologues from Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher&quot; was released, which featured opening monologues from the show accompanied by explanations of the current affairs that were being discussed in the media at that time.

<doc id="329833" wikidata="Q297252" url="?curid=329833" title="David Moyes">
<text>David William Moyes (born 25 April 1963) is a Scottish professional football manager and former player, who manages Premier League club Everton. He was the 2003, 2005 and 2009 League Managers Association Manager of the Year. He is also on the committee for the League Managers Association in an executive capacity.

Moyes made over 540 league appearances as a centre-back in a playing career that began with Celtic, where he won a championship medal. He then played for Cambridge United, Bristol City, Shrewsbury Town, and Dunfermline Athletic before ending his playing career with Preston North End. He became a coach at Preston, working his way up to assistant manager before eventually taking over as manager in 1998, his first managerial position. Moyes led Preston to the Division Two title in 1999–2000 and the Division One play-off final the following season.

Moyes took over from Walter Smith as manager of Everton in March 2002. Under him, the club managed a fourth-place finish in the league in 2004–05, their highest finish since 1988, and played in the qualifying rounds for the UEFA Champions League the following season, the first time they had taken part in UEFA&#x27;s most prestigious cup competition since 1970–71. Moyes also led Everton to a runners-up finish in the 2008–09 FA Cup, their best performance in the competition since winning it in 1995. Everton consistently finished between fifth and eighth in the league under Moyes, and at the time of his departure, he was the longest-serving current manager in the league behind Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger, at 11 years and 3 months.

Moyes succeeded Ferguson as manager of Manchester United in June 2013, but with the club in seventh place in the league in April 2014 and unable to qualify for European competition, he was sacked after 10 months in the job. Moyes was appointed as head coach of Spanish club Real Sociedad in November 2014, but was again sacked after just under a year in charge. In July 2016, he replaced Sam Allardyce as manager of Sunderland, but resigned at the end of the 2016–17 season after the club was relegated to the EFL Championship. 

Moyes was appointed manager of West Ham in November 2017 and led the club out of the relegation zone to a 13th-place finish, but left at the end of the season when his contract was not renewed. He was appointed at West Ham for a second time in December 2019, following the sacking of Manuel Pellegrini. During his second stint, West Ham achieved two consecutive top-seven finishes in the Premier League, before victory in the 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League, beating Fiorentina in the final to achieve the club&#x27;s first major silverware in 43 years. Moyes left West Ham in 2024, and returned to Everton the following year.

==Playing career==
===Club career===
Moyes started his career at Icelandic club ÍBV, playing half a season with the youth team in 1978. Moyes enjoyed a career that encompassed playing at a number of clubs, usually as a centre-back, beginning at Celtic, where he won a championship medal and made 24 league appearances, and ending with Preston North End.

As a player with Cambridge United, Moyes received abuse from teammate Roy McDonough for his religious beliefs; Moyes is a practising Christian. McDonough felt that religion was distracting them from focusing on playing; speaking of Moyes, Alan Comfort and Graham Daniels, he said: &quot;The three of them sat in the changing room with a little black book, discussing their faith, when they should have been getting psyched up for a relegation scrap.&quot; Following a 3–3 draw with Wigan Athletic on 9 March 1985, McDonough, who was 26 years old at the time, states that he &quot;battered&quot; Moyes for not putting sufficient effort into the game.

While playing for Shrewsbury Town in 1987, Moyes began coaching at the nearby private school, Concord College, on the recommendation of Jake King as a way to supplement his wages. Moyes later made over one hundred appearances for Dunfermline Athletic between 1990 and 1993, including a starting appearance in the 1991 Scottish League Cup final.

Moyes made over 530 league appearances in his career before becoming a coach at Preston, working his way up to assistant manager before eventually taking over as manager in 1998.

===International career===
Moyes captained Scotland at under-18 age group level. He played under former UEFA Technical Director Andy Roxburgh in 1980.

==Managerial career==
===Preston North End===
Moyes took over as Preston North End manager in January 1998, replacing Gary Peters as the club struggled in Division Two and were in danger of relegation. He had spent much of his playing career preparing for management, taking coaching badges at just 22 years of age and compiling notes on managers he had played under, their techniques and tactics. Preston avoided relegation at the end of the 1997–98 season and reached the Division Two play-offs the following season, where they were beaten by Gillingham at the semi-final stage.

The following season, Moyes guided Preston to the Division Two title and a promotion to Division One. An even greater achievement perhaps was to steer Preston into the Division One play-offs the season after that, with largely the same squad. Preston lost 3–0 to Bolton Wanderers in the 2001 Football League First Division play-off final, missing out on promotion to the Premier League. One month later, Moyes signed a new five-year contract with the club. In 2001, whilst studying for his UEFA Pro License, Moyes shadowed Roy Hodgson at Udinese during Hodgson&#x27;s six month spell at the club. Towards the end of the following season, he left for Everton, to take over from fellow Scotsman Walter Smith in March 2002. Moyes took charge of Preston for 234 matches, of which his team won 113, drew 58 and lost 63.

===Everton===
====2002–2004====
Moyes joined Everton on 14 March 2002 and at his unveiling press conference, declared that Everton were &#x27;The People&#x27;s Club&#x27; on Merseyside. He said: &quot;I am from a city (Glasgow) that is not unlike Liverpool. I am joining the people&#x27;s football club. The majority of people you meet on the street are Everton fans. It is a fantastic opportunity, something you dream about. I said &#x27;yes&#x27; right away as it is such a big club.&quot;
His first game in charge was two days later, against Fulham at Goodison Park. Everton won the game 2–1, with David Unsworth scoring after just 30 seconds.

Everton managed to sustain a good run of form and avoided relegation, which was a genuine threat when he was originally appointed. Despite having a history and list of honours only surpassed in English football by Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United, the past decade had not been a successful time for the Toffees, with an FA Cup win in 1995 and a sixth-place finish in 1996 being about the only bright spots for the club that side of 1990.

Moyes prepared for his first full season in charge at Everton by signing Chinese international Li Tie, Nigerian defender Joseph Yobo and goalkeeper Richard Wright and released older players such as Jesper Blomqvist and David Ginola. On 12 April 2003, Moyes was sent to the stands during a game against West Bromwich Albion by referee Steve Bennett for using foul and abusive language and for improper behaviour. Everton were edged out of qualification for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup on the last day of the season by Blackburn Rovers, following a defeat by Manchester United, and finished seventh in the league. Moyes was awarded LMA Manager of the Year for the first time, to go with the Premier League Manager of the Month award for November 2002, when the Toffees had been in the Champions League places.

For the 2003–04 season, Moyes signed Kevin Kilbane from Sunderland, James McFadden from Motherwell, Nigel Martyn from Leeds United and Francis Jeffers returned on loan from Arsenal. Poor results followed though and Everton did not win a game in 2004 until 28 February. A confrontation between Moyes and Duncan Ferguson at Everton&#x27;s training ground was said to be symptomatic of the problems at the club. Everton finished 17th with 39 points, the lowest total in the club&#x27;s history until 2022–23, (although survival had been confirmed some time earlier), just avoiding relegation.

====2004–2009====
During the summer of 2004, despite the turmoil surrounding the club&#x27;s recent form, Moyes managed to bring in Tim Cahill and Marcus Bent. To this day, Cahill is considered to be one of Moyes&#x27; best signings, scoring 15 goals in his first season playing for Everton. Those who left the club were Tomasz Radzinski, Tobias Linderoth, David Unsworth and, most significantly Wayne Rooney, who joined Manchester United for a reported £25.6 million. Later, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published extracts from Rooney&#x27;s autobiography, claiming that Moyes had forced Rooney out of the club and then leaked the details to the press. Moyes went on to sue for libel before settling out of court when Rooney apologised and agreed to pay for damages. Moyes donated the undisclosed damages from the suit to the Everton Former Players&#x27; Foundation.

During the 2004–05 season, Everton went on to surpass all expectations by finishing fourth in the league and securing a place in the following season&#x27;s third qualification round for the UEFA Champions League, Moyes again being awarded the LMA Manager of the Year award. Moyes then broke Everton&#x27;s transfer record to bring in striker James Beattie in January and, as influential midfielder Thomas Gravesen left, Mikel Arteta came in on loan.

At the beginning of the 2005–06 season, Everton struggled again and were battling relegation. Their bid to play in the Champions League ended with a loss to Villarreal in the qualifying round, and the club were defeated 5–1 at FC Dinamo București in the first round of the UEFA Cup. Moyes signed Nuno Valente, Andy van der Meyde, Simon Davies, Per Krøldrup, and Phil Neville; signed Matteo Ferrari on loan; and made Arteta a permanent signing. They climbed from bottom place in late October to a secure 11th-place finish at the end of the season.

Moyes broke the club transfer record for a second time at the start of the 2006–07 season with the £8.6 million acquisition of Andrew Johnson. Joleon Lescott was also signed from Wolverhampton Wanderers while goalkeeper Tim Howard arrived from Manchester United on a loan deal, which was later made permanent. All of these players would prove to be successful signings, further enhancing Moyes&#x27; reputation as a team builder. Whilst Everton&#x27;s league form flourished again, their record in the FA Cup under Moyes did not improve: in the third round they crashed out 4–1 to Blackburn Rovers. An improved league position of sixth was secured along with UEFA Cup football for the next season.

It was the 2007–08 season that Everton displayed the most consistency and stability since Moyes arrived at the club, finally ending the cycle of alternating between the top and bottom halves of the league. In his sixth full season in charge, Moyes secured fifth place in the league and reached the semi-final of the Football League Cup as well as the last 16 of the UEFA Cup, eventually being beaten on penalties by Fiorentina. Moyes also signed four more players who went on to become very important players for Everton: Yakubu was signed for another record fee of £11.25 million, Steven Pienaar for £2.05 million after an initial loan, Phil Jagielka was brought in for £4 million, and Leighton Baines was signed for a fee that could rise to £6 million. All of this gave Everton and its fans cause for optimism as a string of strong performances broke the pattern inconsistency which saw league finishes of 15th, 7th, 17th, 4th and 11th under Moyes. His reputation as a disciplinarian could be seen to manifest in Everton&#x27;s yellow card count. They received just 27 yellow cards all season – the lowest in the league and six fewer than their nearest rival Liverpool.

Moyes recruited Steve Round as his assistant manager for the 2008–09 season to replace Alan Irvine, who had taken over as Preston North End manager the previous winter. Everton&#x27;s first new player of the season, Lars Jacobsen, was brought in two games into the season. This was shortly followed by the signings of Segundo Castillo and Louis Saha. On deadline day, Moyes secured the services of goalkeeper Carlo Nash on a free transfer, and Marouane Fellaini for a club record £15 million. On 14 September, Moyes was sent to the stands by referee Alan Wiley during a game against Stoke City. He was later fined £5,000 by The Football Association for improper conduct and warned about his future behaviour.

At the end of the transfer window January 2009, Moyes brought in Brazilian international striker Jô on loan from Manchester City. On 14 October 2008, Moyes agreed to extend his Goodison Park stay by a further five years. On 19 April 2009, Moyes led his team to an FA Cup semi-final victory over Manchester United, after a penalty shoot-out, to reach the final for the first time since 1995. In what would be Everton&#x27;s only appearance in a final during Moyes&#x27; time at the club, Everton were beaten 2–1 by Chelsea despite taking a lead through Louis Saha in the opening minute.

====2009–2013====
In the summer of 2009, Moyes sold Joleon Lescott to Manchester City for £22 million, after a saga that lasted for the entire transfer window. With the money from the Lescott sale, Moyes brought in Johnny Heitinga, Sylvain Distin and Diniyar Bilyaletdinov. He also re-signed Jô on a season-long loan and Lucas Neill on a free transfer. Moyes was named as Premier League Manager of the Month for January 2010 after three wins and a draw. Moyes took charge of his 600th match as a manager on 6 February 2010 in the Merseyside Derby against Liverpool which resulted in a 1–0 defeat. Everton ended the season in eighth place, failing to qualify for Europe for the first time in four years despite a run of only two defeats in their last 24 league games.

On 14 May 2010, Moyes revealed he would be interested in taking up the Celtic job in the future; that job did indeed become vacant at the end of the 2009–10 season with the departure of Tony Mowbray, but Moyes did not put his name forward for the vacancy and Neil Lennon was appointed instead. In August 2010, Moyes dismissed speculation linking him with the manager&#x27;s job at Aston Villa left vacant by the resignation of Martin O&#x27;Neill.

In September 2010, Moyes admitted an improper conduct charge in relation to his behaviour towards referee Martin Atkinson following a 3–3 draw with Manchester United. He was fined £8,000 with his assistant Steve Round also admitting to the same charge.
In January 2012, Moyes became the fourth manager, after Alex Ferguson, Arsène Wenger and Harry Redknapp, to record 150 wins in the Premier League. He celebrated his 400th Premier League game in November 2012 with a 2–1 win against Sunderland.

Upon reaching his 10th anniversary at the club Moyes received praise from many fellow managers including Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsène Wenger and Kenny Dalglish for his achievements at Everton. His service to Everton was also praised in Parliament by Steve Rotheram MP.

On 9 May 2013, following Ferguson&#x27;s retirement at Manchester United and with his own contract expiring at the end of the season, Moyes informed Everton that he would leave the club to succeed Ferguson. Three days after being named as Ferguson&#x27;s successor at Manchester United, Moyes took charge of his last game with Everton at Goodison. He received a guard of honour by his own players prior to the post-match lap of appreciation, and Everton fans held banners with messages such as &quot;Goodbye and Good luck&quot;, and &quot;Thanks for the memories&quot;. On his reception, Moyes stated, &quot;It was really emotional. All the stewards were standing clapping me when I came in and I didn&#x27;t know what to do. I am gobsmacked and thankful and humbled for what the people of Everton have shown me today&quot;.

Some fans at Everton dubbed Moyes &quot;Dithering Dave&quot;, criticising what they saw as indecisive management, particularly regarding transfers. Another criticism of his eleven years at Everton was his away record against the &quot;Big Four&quot; (the four best Premier League teams of the last decade), Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool. In 43 matches at Old Trafford, Stamford Bridge, Highbury/Emirates Stadium and Anfield, his Everton team failed to win a single game.

===Manchester United===

Moyes signed a six-year contract with Manchester United, and officially took up his managerial position on 1 July 2013. Moyes had been hand-picked as manager by Sir Alex Ferguson and after his appointment a banner reading &quot;The Chosen One&quot; was displayed at Old Trafford. His first unofficial game as United manager ended in defeat as Teeratep Winothai scored the only goal for Singha All Stars in Bangkok on 13 July 2013. On 11 August 2013, he won his only trophy with Manchester United in his first official game, a 2–0 win over Wigan Athletic in the FA Community Shield. It meant he became the first United manager in history to win a trophy outright in his first season in charge. Less than a week later, he won his first league game in charge of the club, opening the season with a 4–1 victory against Swansea City, but after that, United suffered their worst ever start to a Premier League season, leading the start of his reign to be described as &quot;calamitous&quot; following a 1–0 defeat at Liverpool, a 4–1 defeat at Manchester City and a 2–1 home defeat by West Bromwich Albion (United&#x27;s first defeat to West Brom at home since 1978), with several journalists stating the pressure was now on despite it being early in his reign. On 2 September 2013, Moyes signed Marouane Fellaini on a four-year contract, with the option of extension of another season, reuniting with his former player in a £27.5 million deadline day deal.

In December, Manchester United lost Premier League matches at home to Everton and Newcastle United in the space of four days (United&#x27;s first defeat at home to Everton in 21 years, and first at home to Newcastle in 41 years), suffering back-to-back league defeats at Old Trafford for the first time since the 2001–02 season. United were ninth in the table after 15 games, 13 points behind leaders Arsenal. Moyes said that he took &quot;complete responsibility&quot; for United&#x27;s defeats but said he was confident his team would improve. Moyes did however have a positive start to his first Champions League campaign with the club. United finished top of their group after winning four of their six group stage matches.

In January 2014, United were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round by Swansea City, losing 2–1 at home (Swansea&#x27;s first ever win at Old Trafford), and lost in the semi-final of the Football League Cup, with Sunderland winning a penalty shoot-out. In February, United lost 2–1 at Stoke (Stoke&#x27;s first win over United in 30 years). Following consecutive 0–3 home defeats against Liverpool and Manchester City, a flypast was staged by United fans with the banner displaying &quot;Wrong One – Moyes Out&quot; in seven-foot high lettering during a home match against Aston Villa in March. After the match, which United won 4–1, Moyes said the majority of fans had been &quot;very supportive&quot; of him. The club reached the quarter-final stage of the Champions League, after beating Olympiacos, but were defeated 4–2 on aggregate by Bayern Munich.

On 20 April 2014, United lost 2–0 at Everton (the first time Everton had beat United home and away in 44 years). Two days later, United announced that they had sacked Moyes. Moyes was in charge of United for 10 months, the third-shortest managerial stint in United history and the shortest in 82 years, despite calls from several respected ex-Manchester United players such as Denis Law and David Beckham calling for Moyes to be given more time at the club. At the time of his sacking, United were seventh in the Premier League table, 13 points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with four matches remaining, ensuring United would fail to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1995 and finish outside of the top three for the first time in Premier League history. Moyes had won 5 points from a possible 24 against Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City, and Arsenal (the top four at the time of sacking). He was replaced in the interim by long-serving player Ryan Giggs and permanently by Louis van Gaal. Moyes was awarded £5 million in compensation following the sacking.

Moyes was critiqued for his perceived defeatist attitude while at United. He had referred to their rivals Liverpool as the &quot;favourites&quot; ahead of their trip to Old Trafford (Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers responded &quot;I would never say that at Liverpool – even if I was bottom of the league&quot;), and on Man United, the defending champions, Moyes stated their city rivals Manchester City were &quot;at the sort of level we are aspiring to&quot;. Calling the appointment of Moyes Ferguson&#x27;s second biggest mistake as Man United manager, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; stated, &quot;Moyes never sounded or managed like a United manager. United got an Everton manager, Everton coaches, an Everton player and achieved an Everton finish; seventh&quot;.

=== Real Sociedad ===
On 10 November 2014, Moyes was appointed as the new head coach of La Liga club Real Sociedad on an 18-month deal after the dismissal of Jagoba Arrasate, with the team lying in 15th on the table. His managerial debut was an away league match against Deportivo La Coruña on 22 November, which ended in a goalless draw. Six days later, in his first home match at Anoeta, he earned his first victory as the club&#x27;s coach, Carlos Vela scoring a hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Elche. On 4 January 2015, Moyes led Sociedad to a 1–0 win over Barcelona, a result which journalists compared to his management of Everton and contrasted with his results at Manchester United. Ten days later, in a 2–2 home draw against Villarreal which eliminated his team from the Copa del Rey, Moyes was sent to the stand and later given a two-match touchline ban for arguing over an offside decision.

He was sacked on 9 November 2015 after coming under increasing pressure due to a poor start to the season.

=== Sunderland ===
On 23 July 2016, Moyes was appointed as the replacement for Sam Allardyce as manager of Sunderland, returning to the Premier League for the first time since his sacking as United boss in April 2014.

On 3 April 2017, it was revealed that Moyes had made a controversial remark after a post-match interview after Sunderland&#x27;s goalless draw with Burnley on 18 March. After the interview with the BBC&#x27;s Vicki Sparks, while the microphone was still audible, Moyes, said: &quot;It was getting a wee bit naughty at the end there so just watch yourself. You still might get a slap even though you&#x27;re a woman. Careful the next time you come in&quot;. Moyes apologised for the incident. The FA wrote to Moyes to ask for his observations on the incident. In June that year, he was fined £30,000 for the comments, a decision that was upheld by an independent panel the following month.

Sunderland were confirmed to be relegated to the EFL Championship for the first time in ten years on 29 April 2017, after a 1–0 loss to AFC Bournemouth, marking the first relegation of Moyes&#x27; career. After the match, he stated that he would like to remain as manager. However, on 22 May, one day after the end of the Premier League season, Moyes resigned.

===West Ham United===
====Initial stint (2017–2018)====
Moyes was appointed manager of West Ham United on 7 November 2017, with the team in the relegation zone. Moyes marked his first game in charge of West Ham, and his 500th Premier League game, with a 2–0 loss away to Watford on 19 November. On 9 December, he won as Hammers manager for the first time, Marko Arnautović scoring the only goal of a win over reigning champions Chelsea at the London Stadium. On 13 January 2018, West Ham registered a 4–1 win away to Huddersfield, which became Moyes&#x27; 200th victory as a Premier League manager, he became only the fourth to reach this milestone, after Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsène Wenger and Harry Redknapp. Following a 2–0 win at Leicester City on 5 May 2018 and with two games remaining of the season, Moyes managed West Ham to Premier League survival for the 2017–18 season. His six-month deal with West Ham expired on 13 May 2018 and he left the club shortly after.

====Second stint (2019–2024)====
On 29 December 2019, Moyes returned to his previous position as the manager of West Ham United on an 18-month contract. He replaced Manuel Pellegrini, who had left them in 17th in the Premier League table, one point above the relegation zone. Speaking about his return to West Ham, Moyes said, &quot;I think there&#x27;s only two or three managers with a better Premier League win record. That&#x27;s what I do, I win. I&#x27;m here to get West Ham wins and get them away from the bottom three.&quot;

His first game on return resulted in a 4–0 win, against Bournemouth, in the Premier League on 1 January 2020. West Ham finished in 16th place in the Premier League with 39 points, their lowest points tally since 2010–11 when they gained 33 points and finished bottom. Moyes&#x27; 19 games in charge produced 20 points, one more than the previous 19 games managed by Manuel Pellegrini.

In the 2020–21 season, Moyes guided West Ham to a record Premier League points total of 65, finishing in sixth place and qualifying for the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League. The team won 19 Premier League games, including nine away, both records for the club. Owing to these strong performances, some West Ham supporters affectionately given the manager the moniker &quot;Moyesiah&quot;. In June 2021, Moyes signed a new three-year contract with West Ham.

In the 2021–22 season, Moyes guided West Ham to a top-seven finish and a Europa League semi-final, where they lost 3–1 on aggregate to Eintracht Frankfurt. It was the first time in club history that the club finished in the top seven in back-to-back seasons.

In the 2022–23 season, Moyes led the club to victory in the 2023 UEFA Europa Conference League final against Fiorentina to finish undefeated in the tournament play, winning 12 games and drawing one. West Ham finished the Premier League season in 14th place, the lowest table position any team winning a European trophy has ever finished.

In February 2024, with some supporters calling for him to be replaced, Moyes said he had been offered another contract but would wait until the end of the season before deciding if he should sign it. In April 2024, after Moyes had received criticism from some fans for his perceived negative style of play, a spokesperson for West Ham said they would be waiting until the end of the season before deciding on any future contract. On 6 May 2024, West Ham confirmed that Moyes would leave the club at the end of his current contract, at the end of the 2023–24 season.
===Return to Everton===
On 11 January 2025, Moyes returned to Everton on a two-and-a-half-year contract, replacing previous manager Sean Dyche, who had left the club 16th in the league, one point above the relegation zone. On 19 January 2025, Moyes guided Everton to their first win in six matches in the Premier League, winning 3–2 at home against Tottenham Hotspur.

==Commentary work==
During the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Moyes provided some commentary for selected matches for BBC Radio 5 Live. Moyes co-owns the racehorse Desert Cry, which was trained by Ginger McCain. In May 2024, Talksport announced Moyes as one of their broadcast team covering Euro 2024 in June and July 2024. He was also part of the BBC team at Euro 2024.

==Personal life==
Moyes was born and raised in the Thornwood area of Glasgow, before his family moved to the nearby town of Bearsden. Moyes&#x27; father, David Sr, was a scout at Everton and previously a coach at Drumchapel Amateurs, where Moyes began his career. His full-time occupation was as a pattern-maker and later a lecturer at Anniesland College in North Glasgow. Moyes&#x27; mother, Joan, hailed from Portrush in Northern Ireland and worked in clothes stores in Glasgow. His cousin, Dessie Brown, is secretary of Coleraine Football Club. Moyes&#x27; nephew is former Livingston player Ewan Moyes.

Moyes is a devout Christian who would often discuss religion with Alan Comfort and Graham Daniels, although he is often reluctant to talk about his faith in interviews.

Moyes is a supporter of the Labour Party and in 2010 backed Andy Burnham to be leader in the Labour Party leadership election. During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum he was a supporter of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence.

In 2005, Moyes received an honorary fellowship from Myerscough College near Preston. In December 2017, Moyes received another honorary fellowship from the University of Central Lancashire.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Moyes accepted a 30% cut to his salary as West Ham looked to retain jobs allowing them to pay 100% of non-playing staff salaries. He left London during the pandemic and worked in his home village in Lancashire delivering fruit and vegetables to those in need. On 22 September 2020, shortly before an EFL Cup fixture against Hull City, Moyes and players Josh Cullen and Issa Diop tested positive for COVID-19 and left the ground before the game. His place was taken by Alan Irvine as West Ham won 5–1. He then returned a second positive test three days later.

In April 2021, Moyes spoke in favour of merging the English and Scottish football league pyramids and expanding the Premier League into two divisions.

Moyes was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2025 New Year Honours for services to football.

<doc id="329846" wikidata="Q57138" url="?curid=329846" title="Within Temptation">
<text>Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1996 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have been classified by critics as gothic metal and symphonic metal, although each album contains other influences outside these genres. Critics have noticed the band&#x27;s experimentation and musical versatility. In an interview, den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In another interview, den Adel stated that &quot;We consider ourselves more an atmospheric melodic symphonic metal/rock band... In my opinion, we are not a gothic band but we have gothic elements&quot;.

After the release of their debut album &quot;Enter&quot; in 1997, the band became prominent in the Dutch underground scene. It was not until 2001 that they became known to the general public, with the single &quot;Ice Queen&quot; from their second album &quot;Mother Earth&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the Dutch charts. This was followed by the band winning the Conamus Exportprijs, a Dutch music award, four years in a row, and a fifth in 2016. Within Temptation&#x27;s next albums, &quot;The Silent Force&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Heart of Everything&quot; (2007), debuted at No. 1 on the Dutch charts and expanded their international recognition. In 2008, they released &quot;Black Symphony&quot;, a live album recorded with the Metropole Orchestra. This was followed in 2009 by &quot;An Acoustic Night at the Theatre&quot;, another live album, this time with acoustic renditions of the songs.

The band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;The Unforgiving&quot;, was released in March 2011 and was one part of a transmedia effort, alongside both a comic book series and a series of short films that together encompass a story. The album saw the band increasingly venturing on new musical territories outside symphonic metal.

The group advanced the exploration of other musical genres in their subsequent releases. Their sixth studio album, &quot;Hydra&quot;, was released in early 2014, and featured guest appearances from various artists: Finnish singer Tarja Turunen, who appears in the lead single &quot;Paradise (What About Us?)&quot;; Howard Jones, former vocalist of American metalcore band Killswitch Engage; Dave Pirner, lead vocalist of American alternative rock band Soul Asylum; and American rapper Xzibit. Their seventh studio album, &quot;Resist&quot;, was released in February 2019 and incorporated influences from other musical styles such as industrial and EDM. &quot;Bleed Out&quot;, their latest studio effort, was released on 20 October 2023, and contains influences from metalcore and djent, alongside hints from their initial gothic metal inclinations.

By 2016, the band had already sold more than 3.5 million albums worldwide.

==History==
===Formation===
Long-term partners Robert Westerholt (guitar) and Sharon den Adel (vocals) began the band in 1996, after Westerholt left his previous band, The Circle. The Circle renamed themselves &quot;Voyage&quot; and released an album called &quot;Embrace&quot;, including a song featuring den Adel. Soon after that release the band broke up.

Westerholt then joined with den Adel in forming a doom metal band called &quot;The Portal&quot;, including former The Circle band members Jeroen van Veen on bass guitar and Michiel Papenhove on guitar, as well as Martijn Westerholt on the keyboard and Dennis Leeflang on drums (later replaced by Ivar de Graaf). However, they renamed themselves &quot;Within Temptation&quot;, before they started recording their demo, &quot;Enter&quot;. The &quot;Enter&quot; demo contained some songs that would later be released in their first album. They were offered a recording contract and signed to DSFA Records later that year, beginning work on their first album.

===&quot;Enter&quot; and first national tour (1997–1999)===

&quot;Enter&quot;, the debut album, was released in 1997. The album was well received and the band embarked on a four gig tour across the country, after which they performed at the &quot;Dynamo Open Air&quot; festival in Eindhoven. The band rounded out 1997 by embarking on their first international tour of Germany and Austria. Also, subsequently Ivar de Graaf left the band and was replaced by Ciro Palma.

The sound of &quot;Enter&quot;, whilst melodic, was doomily paced, and influenced by gothic doom metal, heavily reliant on slow keyboards and drums and repetitive guitar riffs. Also prominent on this album are death grunts by Robert Westerholt and George Oosthoek, ex-member of Orphanage.

In 1998 the band continued to tour – their profile had elevated them to the main stage at &quot;Dynamo&quot; for the 1998 event. However, Within Temptation had released no new material (and did not have plans for a second album at this point), to which end they elected to release an EP, &quot;The Dance&quot;, with three songs (plus two remixes) that would further mature the sound from Enter.

Finally taking a break from touring, 1999 was largely a sabbatical year for the band. They took the opportunity to construct their own studio, as well as returning to personal pursuits, with plans to return to the fold the next year.

===&quot;Mother Earth&quot; and national breakthrough (2000–2003)===

2000 was an eventful year for the band as they returned to touring, playing three Dutch festivals; &quot;Waterpop&quot;, &quot;Bospop&quot; and &quot;Lowlands&quot;. In addition, they went to work on their second album, releasing &quot;Mother Earth&quot; in the Low Countries on 1 December. The album was a moderate success in the Dutch charts the first few weeks after its release.
The band released the single &quot;Our Farewell&quot;, which never entered the charts. The second single from Mother Earth, &quot;Ice Queen&quot;, was regarded as the breakthrough release for the band; in March 2002 it climbed to No. 2 in the Netherlands but was their first No. 1 single when it climbed to the top in Belgium. The success rebounded to &quot;Mother Earth&quot;, which continued to climb in the Dutch album chart, ending the year at No. 3.

2001 saw a number of changes in personnel; Ruud Jolie was added as a second guitarist, drummer Ivar de Graaf was replaced by Stephen van Haestregt, and Martijn Westerholt (suffering from infectious mononucleosis) was replaced by Martijn Spierenburg. Westerholt later started the band Delain.

In 2002 they had their first concert in France and a headline gig in Mexico City. They attained their first major award, the Dutch &quot;Silver Harp&quot;. They bolstered this by embarking on a major international tour supporting Paradise Lost in 2003 and re-releasing &quot;Mother Earth&quot; on the GUN Records label across more European countries; it was a success in Germany, where it went platinum and reached No. 7 in the charts; the re-release of &quot;Ice Queen&quot; also charted well in the top 30. In turn the Benelux regions got a different release, a cover of Kate Bush&#x27;s &quot;Running Up that Hill&quot;. The band headlined music festivals across the Netherlands, while their &quot;Mother Earth&quot; tour DVD claimed the prestigious Edison Award. Promotion of &quot;Mother Earth&quot; in newer markets continued well into 2004 with various international festival appearances (such as M&#x27;era Luna, Rock Werchter, and Pukkelpop) and other headline gigs, which also saw the band make their UK live debut in London in September of that year.

===&quot;The Silent Force&quot; and further recognition (2004–2006)===
Plans for the band&#x27;s third album came to fruition in 2004, with the release of &quot;The Silent Force&quot; on 15 November 2004, across Europe. It was produced by Daniel Gibson and an instant No. 1 in the Netherlands and charted well in many European countries. In support of the release they embarked on another large international tour in 2005, with dates across Europe (including their first festival appearance in the United Kingdom headlining the Bloodstock festival) and a one-off show in Dubai. As of early 2005, the album had already sold more than 400.000 copies only in Europe. &quot;Stand My Ground&quot; and &quot;Memories&quot;, the first singles from the new album, continued the band&#x27;s run of chart success, culminating in a second Edison Award. The third single was &quot;Angels&quot;. &quot;Stand My Ground&quot; was later to be promoted on the trailer for the film &quot;Blood and Chocolate&quot;. The band also provided some of the soundtrack to the video game &quot;Knights of the Temple: Infernal Crusade&quot; released in March.

In January 2006, Within Temptation won the &quot;Dutch Pop Prize&quot; (best Dutch contribution) and &quot;Dutch Export Prize&quot; (best-selling Dutch artist outside the Netherlands); the latter one given to them for the third time in a row. The band also reported that they were busy working on their next album, due to be released during the fall and that they would start playing at festivals starting in April, in addition to going on an international tour at the end of the year. Although already being successful in Europe, it was not until 5 August 2008, that both &quot;Mother Earth&quot; and &quot;The Silent Force&quot; albums were released in the North American market for the first time, through Roadrunner Records.

===&quot;The Heart of Everything&quot;, international recognition and first world tour (2007–2008)===
The album &quot;The Heart of Everything&quot; from Within Temptation was released on 9 March 2007, in the Netherlands, and in the United States on 24 July. Two tracks, called &quot;The Howling&quot; and &quot;Sounds of Freedom&quot;, were recorded as promotion material for the video game &quot;The Chronicles of Spellborn&quot;, and the first of these opens the album. The full track listing was revealed on 10 January. The album debuted at No. 1 in the Dutch Album 100, making it their second number-one album. It reached No. 2 in Belgium, No. 2 in Finland, the top 10 in eight countries and top 100 in eleven countries.

The song &quot;What Have You Done&quot; was the first single released from the album. Its initial music video was recorded on the 12, 13 and 14 December 2006 at the Koko club in London, and a CGI studio in Windsor. It features Mina Caputo of Life of Agony on guest vocals. Fans were allowed to participate in the making of the video, although this first version left the band feeling disappointed (comments made by the band at their March show in Lyon). Shortly after, a completely new video for the song was made. The second single, released across Europe in June, was &quot;Frozen&quot;. The video, filmed in Romania, deals with child abuse, and sales of the single was to raise money for a children&#x27;s charity, Child Helpline International. &quot;The Howling&quot; was chosen as a digital single release for the UK (not to be confused with the US EP release), and another video was also shot. The extended version of the &quot;Frozen&quot; single features an unreleased b-side, &quot;Sounds of Freedom&quot;, as mentioned the second song written for the promotion of the computer game &quot;The Chronicles of Spellborn&quot;. Roadrunner Records also released a limited edition EP called &quot;The Howling&quot;, which was available only at Hot Topic stores, containing the title track plus popular tracks from their former album &quot;The Silent Force&quot;.

Within Temptation started their very first United States tour a few months after the European release of &quot;The Heart of Everything&quot;, supporting Lacuna Coil, and appearing alongside In This Moment, Stolen Babies, The Gathering, and Kylesa. The tour, dubbed The Hottest Chicks in Metal Tour 2007, was largely a success. &quot;The Heart of Everything&quot; was then released there on 24 July, and the promotional single of &quot;What Have You Done&quot; shipped to rock stations 2 July. This was the band&#x27;s first album to be released in America followed by the previous albums &quot;Mother Earth&quot; and &quot;The Silent Force&quot; a year later.

 In support of the new album, Within Temptation decided to kick off their first headlining US tour in Fall 2007. The band played 13 shows, starting on 5 September 2007, in Boston and ended on 23 September 2007, in Tempe, Arizona.

On 19 October 2007, Within Temptation released the video for their third single &quot;All I Need&quot;. The single was released in Europe around 12 November and features the single and album versions of the title track plus demo versions of &quot;The Last Time&quot; (previously unreleased track), &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Our Solemn Hour&quot;.

In November 2007, the band released info that their concert at Beursgebouw, in Eindhoven, was filmed for possible inclusion on a new concert DVD (either parts or all of the show). On 7 February 2008, the band performed a 10,000 audience show entitled &quot;Black Symphony&quot; at the Ahoy in Nederlands together with The Metropole Orchestra, a choir and several guest artists, and it was later revealed that this show would be filmed in its entirety for DVD and Blu-ray together with a double CD, which was to be released on 22 September 2008 (international) and 23 September 2008 (in the US). The trailer for the DVD (containing the entire live performance of the song &quot;Our Solemn Hour&quot; from the show) was released on the band&#x27;s Opendisc feature on 16 July 2008. Another single from &quot;The Heart of Everything&quot;, Forgiven, was released to promote the Black Symphony release. Later, Black Symphony was certified Gold in the Netherlands.

===&quot;An Acoustic Night at the Theatre&quot; (2009–2010)===
On 3 November 2008, Ruud Jolie stated on his blog, that the members of Within Temptation were going to take a year off, writing that &quot;After the Theater Tour, that will start next week, me and the rest of Within Temptation are gonna take a whole year off. For the last 7 years, we&#x27;ve been hopping from studio to tour bus to airplane to boat to studio again to tour bus to bicycle to airplane to an occasional swimming pool on the top of a hotel to tour bus again. We all really needed a break from the band...&quot; From that tour, On 11 August 2009, on their official website, Sharon announced that an acoustic album would be released in late October/early November called &quot;An Acoustic Night at the Theatre&quot;. It would include several acoustic songs from their tour in November 2008. On 30 October the album was released, the single was released with the album called &quot;Utopia&quot;. The song is a duet between Sharon and Chris Jones and was released on 23 October.

Their song &quot;What Have You Done&quot; is now on the video game &quot;Guitar Hero: World Tour&quot; and was present on a TV promo of a Grey&#x27;s Anatomy episode, &quot;The Truth Beneath The Rose&quot; was featured in the commercials for The Tudors, season 3, on ShowTime. The song All I Need was featured in the American Television show, Vampire Diaries.

===&quot;The Unforgiving&quot; and second world tour (2011–2012)===
In November 2008, the band announced that they would begin working on their new studio album in 2009, and that the Heart Of Everything Tour was drawing to an end.&#x27; On 1 June 2009, it was announced that Sharon had given birth to a boy, her second child with Robert Westerholt.
In 2010, the band embarked on a second Theatre Tour, their last with drummer Stephen Van Haestregt.

In the meantime, the band continued work on their new studio album. In an interview with Metal Ways at Appelpop 2008, guitarist Robert Westerholt stated that the new album was &quot;probably going to be kind of a concept, but it&#x27;s so early still that nothing is really sure yet. But we&#x27;re trying to look in that direction.&quot;

On 18 November 2010, the band announced via their website that their new album, entitled &quot;The Unforgiving&quot; was released on 29 March 2011. The concept of the album would be based on a comic book series, written by Steven O’Connell (BloodRayne &amp; Dark 48), and illustrated by Romano Molenaar (Witchblade, Darkness and X-Men). Each song on &quot;The Unforgiving&quot; was written along Steven&#x27;s narrative, with characters in the songs reflecting the protagonists of the comic.
On 26 July 2010, the band announced that they would be embarking on a European tour at the beginning of 2011 in support of their new release. However, on 26 November 2010, it was announced that due to Sharon&#x27;s third pregnancy, the tour dates would be moved from early 2011 to fall 2011.

On the official website, den Adel shared that they have recorded three music videos for the album within the course of a week. &#x27;Where Is The Edge&#x27;, a promotional video, was released on 15 December 2010 featuring scenes from the Dutch movie Me &amp; Mr Jones. The first new single, &quot;Faster,&quot; was released 21 January and the video for the song was released 31 January 2011. The track is currently being played in heavy rotation (at least once in each show) on UK classic rock station Planet Rock.
On 22 February 2011, the band announced that Mike Coolen had joined as full-time drummer. However, the studio album had been recorded with Swedish drummer Nicka Hellenberg.

On 14 March 2011, Sony BMG organized an online-listening session of the-upcoming-album on a Polish website that only people from Poland could access. However, every song was soon after leaked onto the Internet. Within Temptation tried to prevent the leak before the release date. Limited promotion CDs were sent strictly to journalists who had to come to a listening session. Later that month, the second short film entitled &quot;Sinéad&quot; was released without an accompanying music video. However, it is available on the special edition CD/DVD set of &quot;The Unforgiving&quot; along with the remaining short film &quot;Triplets&quot; and music video for &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot;. During the album promotional phases, the birth of Logan was reported on the Within Temptation website.

The album debuted at No. 2 in the Netherlands, while the two previous albums, &quot;The Heart of Everything&quot; and &quot;The Silent Force&quot; debuted at No. 1. The Unforgiving also debuted in the Top 10 of Belgium, Portugal, Finland, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and Austria. When the single Faster was released it did not chart as well as other Within Temptation singles like &quot;Stand My Ground&quot; and &quot;Ice Queen&quot;, though in the digital music store iTunes the song placed on the common charts, entering the Top 5 in the Netherlands (#4), while the single reached No. 11 so far. On the digital Rock Charts, Faster became a hit, reaching the No. 1 in the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Spain, No. 2 on Sweden, No. 5 in Germany, No. 6 in Austria, No. 8 in France, No. 10 in Luxembourg, No. 11 in Denmark, No. 13 in the US and No. 18 in Mexico. Following that, the band announced that the new single would be &quot;Sinéad.&quot; Later on, the band was awarded &quot;Best Other Media Music&quot; for its album &quot;The Unforgiving&quot; on the new solenity &quot;Buma Music in Motion&quot;, that awards creative and innovative methods to make music.

On 10 June 2011, the music video of &quot;Sinéad&quot; was officially released to promote the same single, that had its physical release on 15 July. The single was a little different from the others, including 3 remixes of the music made by 3 different DJs.

Proceeding on promotion of the album, the band presented at the Sziget Festival, but The Unforgiving Tour officially started 12 August, at the Huntenpop Festival, where the band played the whole &quot;The Unforgiving&quot; album among other albums hits, in a special show as &quot;The First Challenge&quot;. During August, the band performed at several Summer Festivals as M&#x27;era Luna and Lowlands and started an indoor tour in September, first in the North America and then crossing Europe. In early September, the album reached Gold status in Poland. Later that month, it was announced that Robert would step down touring with the band (except for occasional shows) as there was no-one to look after Robert and Sharon&#x27;s three children. Robert will focus on production and songwriting, while Stefan Helleblad is taking his place on stage.

In early 2012, to continue promoting the album, the band started a South American tour, passing over Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Peru and Ecuador. Right after coming back to Europe, the band presented a semi-acoustic Dutch theater tour in March 2012, called Sanctuary, much like their previous live album &quot;An Acoustic Night at the Theatre&quot; in which they played many songs never played before like &quot;Say My Name&quot;, &quot;The Last Dance&quot;, &quot;Overcome&quot;, &quot;Bittersweet&quot; and some that they don&#x27;t play often like &quot;Restless&quot;, &quot;Sounds Of Freedom&quot;, &quot;The Swan Song&quot; and &quot;Our Farewell&quot;. Most of them were played in acoustic version. On 8 May 2012 Sharon den Adel and Ruud Jolie appeared on DWDD Recordings to perform an acoustic cover of Nirvana&#x27;s song Smells Like Teen Spirit. The band embarked on a second leg of festivals, headlining several of the biggest European 2012 Summer Festivals, such as Sonisphere, Masters of Rock, Rock Werchter, Summerbreeze and Gods of Metal. Later, the band officially announced a very special show called &quot;Elements&quot;. The sold out special show celebrated the band&#x27;s 15-year anniversary at the Sportpaleis, Belgium, and the band was accompanied by the &quot;Il Novecentro Orchestra&quot; and other special guests, such as band&#x27;s ex-members.

===&quot;Hydra&quot; and various influences (2013–2016)===
In the run up to the 15th anniversary of Within Temptation, the band was asked by Belgian radio station &quot;Q-Music&quot; to choose and perform an existing track in a &quot;Within Temptation style&quot; once a week during fifteen weeks during their special program &quot;Within Temptation Friday&quot;. The covers consist most part of pop songs in which the band transformed into a more symphonic oriented form. Lead vocalist Sharon den Adel stated that:“Our approach was to really make the cover a new Within Temptation song. So not going the easy way by using only a piano or an acoustic guitar for example, but really trying to put all the elements of a Within Temptation track in this new version. It was quite a challenge because we had only one week to get it right, while recording an original Within Temptation song can sometimes takes up half a year! But this pressure also gave us an creative boost and it was very rewarding to get it done in time each week. Also, we learned a lot from the in-depth analysis we needed to make on these hits, written by others, in combination with implementing our own sound and style in each new cover. We are glad that we’ve taken up this challenge and are very proud of the result.&quot; They covered artists such as Imagine Dragons, OneRepublic, Lana Del Rey, The Who among others. On 19 April 2013, 11 of the 15 covers made by the band were them released in a cover album entitled &quot;The Q-Music Sessions&quot;. On the same day, the band released the official music video of their cover of &quot;Titanium&quot;.

The writing process of the band&#x27;s next studio album began in 2012, and at the first half of the year the band has 6 songs written already. The album was scheduled to be released worldwide in September, by their new label, BMG and in the Netherlands by Universal Music. On 16 June, the band went on to record the first music video for the new album. During a series of statements about the recording progress of the album, Westerholt stated that the album would contain growls. At the middle of May, bassist Jeroen van Veen went to the studio to record the bass base for the first five songs. On 12 July, the band released a teaser trailer of the upcoming studio album, but without any names revealed. On the next month, the band announced the title of the lead single, in which is &quot;Paradise (What About Us?)&quot;, also uploading a teaser trailer revealing some lyrics and a guitar solo in anticipation for the release. The band eventually got a North American sign deal with Nuclear Blast and, about that partnership the company&#x27;s president Monte Conner stated that 
&quot;There are very few bands out there today who continually deliver on such a high and consistent level as Within Temptation. That is why they have such an incredibly loyal worldwide fan base. I am thrilled they chose Nuclear Blast Entertainment as their US partner. Their fans are in for a real treat come later this year!&quot;. The band also established a licensing deal with Dramatico for the United Kingdom release of the album. Once the drumming and vocal recording was complete, the final guitar recordings started on 26 August.

On 30 August, the band announced that the lead single &quot;Paradise (What About Us?)&quot; would be released as an EP, which is also set to feature 3 tracks from the upcoming album in their demo form, being them &quot;Let Us Burn&quot;, &quot;Silver Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Dog Days&quot;. Upon making this announcement, den Adel said: &quot;By releasing these demos we want to invite you in our home studio and show how we capture song ideas at an early stage of creating a new album. These demo versions are far from their final sound on the album, but will give you a hint of what we&#x27;re working on. It will be fascinating to hear how the end result will sound like, once the album is released.&quot;. After announcing that the lead single would contain a guest musician, on 13 September the band officially announced that Tarja Turunen was set to appear as a special vocalist on the title song. The EP was released on 27 September. On 25 and 26 October, den Adel and Westerholt presented an unknown number of songs of the upcoming album to the press. The second promotional single, Dangerous, was released on 20 December and features ex-Killswitch Engage singer Howard Jones. Hydra was finally released on 31 January 2014, in mainland Europe and on 4 February on North America and United Kingdom, and was met with critical and commercial success. In the Netherlands, &quot;Hydra&quot; marked the band&#x27;s return to the first position on the charts since the release of &quot;The Heart of Everything&quot; in 2007, also reaching the first spot on the Czech Republic album charts, making it their first number-one album outside the Netherlands. The band had their first album on a top 10 position in the UK Albums Chart, debuting at six and the first top 20 position on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, debuting at the number 16.

To promote the album, the band embarked on their Hydra World Tour, which was originally planned to start in January 2014, but then was postponed so the band could polish the songs more before releasing the album and had a try-out show at the Effenaar, in Eindhoven, NL, in which sold out on the same day it was put on sale. The first official show happened on 26 February, in Helsinki, Finland, and the arena tour passed primarily in Europe, covering a few summer festivals. Due to the great reception of &quot;Hydra&quot; in the United States, the band decided to tour again in North America, travelling from West to East coast and passing over twelve cities, being two in Canada and having some venues with sold out tickets. On 2 May, the band announced through their Facebook page that they were going to record the concert at the Heineken Music Hall, Amsterdam, and the great part of the concert later appeared on the DVD &quot;Let Us Burn - Elements &amp; Hydra Live in Concert&quot; together with some parts of the previous tour &quot;Elements&quot; 15th anniversary show. As the end of the European leg, the tour had an attendance of over 120.000 people.

===Den Adel&#x27;s solo project and &quot;Resist&quot; (2017–2019)===
On 3 November 2017, the band changed their website and social media to display only a message announcing that a statement from Sharon den Adel would be coming soon. A video statement appeared 7 days later, in which Sharon announced a new solo project entitled &quot;My Indigo&quot;. The project came by a writer&#x27;s block she had while starting to composing new songs for the band&#x27;s next album, besides also dealing with personal problems, which led her to get some time apart from the band and compose for herself. Later, she decided to release these songs publicly via the aforementioned project. During this process, she regained inspiration to write again for the band, and songs for a new Within Temptation album are currently in the demo phase, with new material to be released in 2018.

At the end of November, the band announced a European tour for the end of the next year. At the beginning of December, almost a year before the tour, two concerts were already sold out. The tour commenced before the release of the album, and saw the band playing selected songs in order to promote it. By the end of 2018, it was reported by the Dutch media that the first European leg of the tour had an attendance of 125,000 people.

In July 2018, Within Temptation signed a new recording contract with Vertigo Records Germany, which was selected to release their seventh studio album worldwide, except in Japan. The first single from the album, titled &quot;The Reckoning&quot; and featuring Jacoby Shaddix, was released on 14 September of that year. The music video for the song marked the first time the band got nominated again for the Edison Award since 2005. The second single, titled &quot;Raise Your Banner&quot; and featuring Anders Fridén, was released on 16 November and the third, &quot;Firelight&quot;, featuring Jasper Steverlinck, was released on 23 November. The album, titled &quot;Resist&quot;, was officially announced through Metal Hammer magazine by the end of 2018 and released on 1 February 2019. The fourth single &quot;In Vain&quot;, was released on 11 January 2019. A music video for &quot;Supernova&quot;, a song off of the album, was released on 5 February 2019. A lyric video for &quot;Mad World&quot; was released on 15 April 2019.

After the album release, the band went back on The Resist Tour to perform fifteen concerts in North America and later on European summer festivals. During the 2019 festival season, the band was scheduled for the first time as one of the headliners for the Graspop Metal Meeting, one of the biggest European heavy metal festivals.

=== &quot;Worlds Collide&quot; tour and &quot;Bleed Out&quot; (2020–present) ===
On 17 September 2019, the band had originally announced that they would be embarking on a co-headlining tour with Evanescence in April and May 2020 titled Worlds Collide. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, both Within Temptation and their co-headliner had postponed the tour to September 2020, later postponing it again to fall 2021, and then postponing again to spring 2022. During the outbreak, the band took part at the Together at Home movement, where artists make online live performances in order to encourage people to stay home and prevent more infection cases. The band also opened for Iron Maiden at selected European and North American dates of the Legacy of the Beast World Tour during 2022.

On 30 April 2020, the band announced the release of a new single on 8 May 2020, &quot;Entertain You&quot;, scheduled to be part of the band&#x27;s upcoming eighth studio album. A music video was later released for the single. A second single titled, &quot;The Purge&quot;, was released on 20 November 2020 along with a music video. Sharon den Adel confirmed on 18 February 2021 that the band plans on releasing more singles, stating that &quot;they are working on it&quot;. A third single, &quot;Shed My Skin&quot;, which features German metalcore band Annisokay as special guests was released on 25 June 2021. The band had also announced on 1 June 2021 that they would be performing two virtual reality concerts on 15 and 16 July 2021, entitled &quot;The Aftermath&quot;, in which they performed a variety of older and new material. A music video for &quot;Shed My Skin&quot;, which consists of the song being performed on the virtual concert, was released on 14 July 2021. Later that year, the re-imagined version of &quot;Forsaken&quot; also performed on the concert was released on streaming platforms. The band&#x27;s first concert with public attendance after the decrease in the pandemic infection cases took place on 29 July 2021, as one of the main acts of the Kuopio Rock open air festival, in Finland.

In an interview with Audio Ink Radio, vocalist Sharon den Adel had confirmed that the band is planning to release more new music in the coming months, stating: &quot;We&#x27;ve only recorded two songs, and we have a lot of demos, which are very far, so we can finish them quite quickly. So we&#x27;re just gonna start with that — we&#x27;re gonna make those demos real songs, and eventually, next year, we&#x27;re gonna release also a few songs again. Eventually there will be an album, but the album is not complete yet, so we have to start writing also some extra new songs to make the whole album complete&quot;.

The band&#x27;s next musical release came in May 2022 from a collaboration with Asking Alexandria on a new version of their song &quot;Faded Out&quot; from &quot;See What&#x27;s on the Inside&quot;. This new version was released alongside a music video featuring promotional scenes leading to the release of the movie The Retaliators. The song is also part of its official soundtrack. The band released another single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Pray for Me&quot;, on 8 July 2022.

On 27 July, den Adel confirmed in an interview that the new album is expected to come out in 2023. On 20 December, the band released the official music video for their track &quot;The Fire Within&quot;, a song originally written back in 2019.

Another single, &quot;Wireless&quot; was released on 18 May 2023. On 17 August 2023, simultaneously with the release of the single of the same name, Within Temptation announced their eighth studio album, &quot;Bleed Out&quot;, which was released on 20 October 2023. A European tour of the same name was later announced on 4 October 2023.

In March 2024, Sharon den Adel came to Kyiv to create a new music video together with Alex Yarmak for the song &quot;A Fool&#x27;s Parade&quot;. On April 11, 2024, the band&#x27;s official channel released the video &quot;A Fool&#x27;s Parade&quot;. In June 2024, after winning several export awards throughout the years, Within Temptation was honored by the Dutch organization Buma Cultuur with a Life Achievement Award. The organization stated that &quot;the band undeniably provided the blueprint for a unique metal genre, which has inspired many and brought the sextet significant success far beyond their home country&quot;.

Spierenburg departed from the band on 9 December 2024.

==Musical style==
The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Enter&quot;, was released in 1997, which music critics classified as two heavy metal subgenres, gothic metal and doom metal classifying the release as &quot;gloomy, doomy, slow moving, atmospheric, symphonic gothic metal.&quot; and compared it with Tristania and Theatre of Tragedy, two other bands in the genre. The guitar riffs and keyboard work were also praised, as were the contrasting voices of the two lead vocalists, Sharon den Adel and Robert Westerholt. The band&#x27;s next record, an EP entitled &quot;The Dance&quot;, released in 1998, was described as &quot;important in the development of the band&quot; presenting &quot;the band&#x27;s musical growth as they explore the parameters of orchestral, neo-classical metal.&quot;

With the release of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Mother Earth&quot;, their musical style came to a point of inflexion, where only den Adel remained as lead vocalist leading the band to more melodic and Celtic songs and more folk influences. Critics approved of the changes in musical direction and suggested that the album &quot;reveals new dimensions in the concept of metal.&quot;

With Daniel Gibson as its main producer, the album &quot;The Silent Force&quot; was classified as &quot;very melodic, catchy and relaxing&quot;.

With the release of &quot;The Heart of Everything&quot;, in 2007, critics were divided on the band&#x27;s new direction, though some appreciated the new direction and found it more varied. &quot;About.com&quot; agreed with both opinions, stating that the album had &quot;the depth and complexity of classical music and the dark edge of gothic metal.&quot; &quot;AllMusic&quot; commented that the band &quot;isn&#x27;t afraid to get downright symphonic&quot;.

In 2011, the band released their fifth studio album, &quot;The Unforgiving&quot;, the biggest change in their musical direction to that point. Although being largely well received by critics, some reviewers disliked the changes, with Q magazine calling the album &quot;The metal T&#x27;Pau&quot;. Besides that, some critics found the &quot;1980s pop, rock and metal&quot; influences a good thing for the band.

In order to celebrate the band&#x27;s 15th anniversary, the Belgian radio station &quot;Q-music&quot; invited the band to make 15 covers of famous songs. Later, the band released &quot;The Q-Music Sessions&quot; album, another divergent genre variation from their original sound. The album featured reworked covers of several famous pop songs, such as &quot;Titanium&quot; by David Guetta featuring Sia, &quot;Grenade&quot; by Bruno Mars, &quot;The Power of Love&quot; by Frankie Goes to Hollywood and also some indie and folk rock songs as The Who&#x27;s &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; and Passenger&#x27;s &quot;Let Her Go&quot;.

The name of the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Hydra&quot;, refers to this great variation in the band&#x27;s main sound, as Westerholt said: &quot;&#x27;Hydra&#x27; is a perfect title for our new album because like the monster itself, the record represents the many different sides of our music.” &quot;The Aquarian Weekly&quot; considered the title highly appropriate and compared it to the band&#x27;s diverse musical history, alleging that they were able to find the right balance between all the musical changes and, during the following tour, the sextet was also referred to as &quot;a band that defy stereotypes&quot;.

<text>A rotten or pocket borough, also known as a nomination borough or proprietorial borough, was a parliamentary borough or constituency in England, Great Britain, or the United Kingdom before the Reform Act of 1832, which had a very small electorate and could be used by a patron to gain unrepresentative influence within the House of Commons. The same terms were used for similar boroughs represented in the 18th-century Parliament of Ireland. The Reform Act abolished the majority of these rotten and pocket boroughs.

==Background==
A parliamentary borough was a town or former town that had been incorporated under a royal charter, giving it the right to send two elected burgesses as Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons. It was not unusual for the physical boundary of the settlement to change as the town developed or contracted over time, for example due to changes in its trade and industry, so that the boundaries of the parliamentary borough and of the physical settlement were no longer the same.

For centuries, constituencies electing members to the House of Commons did not change to reflect population shifts, and in some places the number of electors became so few that they could be bribed or otherwise influenced by a single wealthy patron. In the early 19th century, reformists scornfully called these boroughs &quot;rotten boroughs&quot; because they had so few inhabitants left, or &quot;pocket boroughs&quot;, because their MPs were elected by the whim of the patron, thereby being &quot;in his pocket&quot;; the actual votes of the electors were a mere formality since all or most of them voted as the patron instructed them, with or without bribery. As voting was by show of hands at a single polling station at a single time, few would vote contrary to the declared wishes of the patron. Often only one candidate would be nominated (or two for a two-seat constituency) so that the election was uncontested, because other candidates saw it as futile to stand.

Thus an MP might be elected by only a few voters (although the number of constituents would usually be higher), while at the same time many new towns, which had grown due to increased trade and industry, were inadequately represented. Before 1832 the town of Manchester, which expanded rapidly during the Industrial Revolution from a small settlement into a large city, was merely part of the larger county constituency of Lancashire and did not elect its own MPs.

Many of these ancient boroughs elected two MPs. By the time of the 1831 general election, out of 406 elected members, 152 were chosen by less than 100 voters each, and 88 by fewer than fifty voters.

By the early 19th century moves were made towards reform, with eventual success when the Reform Act 1832 abolished the rotten boroughs and redistributed representation in Parliament to new major population centres. The Ballot Act 1872 introduced the secret ballot, which greatly hindered patrons from controlling elections by preventing them from knowing how an elector had voted. At the same time, the practice of paying or entertaining voters (&quot;treating&quot;) was outlawed, and election expenses fell dramatically.

==Rotten boroughs==
The term &quot;rotten borough&quot; came into use in the 18th century; it meant a parliamentary borough with a tiny electorate, so small that voters were susceptible to control in a variety of ways, as it had declined in population and importance since its early days. The word &quot;rotten&quot; had the connotation of corruption as well as long-term decline. In such boroughs most or all of the few electors could not vote as they pleased, due to the lack of a ballot and their dependency on the &quot;owner&quot; of the borough. Only rarely were the views or personal character of a candidate taken into consideration, except by the minority of voters who were not beholden to a particular interest.

Typically, rotten boroughs had gained their representation in Parliament when they were more flourishing centres, but the borough&#x27;s boundaries had never been changed or they had become depopulated or deserted over the centuries. Some had once been important places or had played a major role in England&#x27;s history but had fallen into insignificance as for example when industry moved away. In the 12th century Old Sarum had been a busy cathedral city, reliant on the wealth expended by Sarum Cathedral within its city precincts, but it was abandoned when the cathedral was moved to create the present Salisbury Cathedral, built on a new site nearby (&quot;New Sarum&quot;). The new site immediately attracted merchants and workers who built up a new town around it. Despite this dramatic loss of population, the constituency of Old Sarum retained its right to elect two MPs, putting them under the control of a landowning family.

Many rotten boroughs were controlled by landowners and peers who might give the seats in Parliament to their like-minded friends or relations, or who went to Parliament if they were not already members of the House of Lords. They also commonly sold them for money or other favours; the peers who controlled such boroughs had a double influence in Parliament as they held seats in the House of Lords. This patronage was based on property rights which could be inherited and passed on to heirs or sold, as a form of property. Despite the small number of voters in each district listed below, for all or much of the time of their existence the boroughs had two MPs.

Before being awarded a peerage, Arthur Wellesley, later Duke of Wellington, served in the Irish House of Commons as a Member for the rotten borough of Trim. Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh served as a Member for the rotten borough of Plympton Erle.

==Pocket boroughs==
Pocket boroughs were boroughs which could effectively be controlled by a single person who owned at least half of the &quot;burgage tenements&quot;, the occupants of which had the right to vote in the borough&#x27;s parliamentary elections. A wealthy patron therefore had merely to buy up these specially qualified houses and install in them his own tenants, selected for their willingness to do their landlord&#x27;s bidding, or given such precarious forms of tenure that they dared not displease him. As there was no secret ballot until 1872, the landowner could evict electors who did not vote for the two men he wanted. A common expression referring to such a situation was that &quot;Mr A had been elected on Lord B&#x27;s interest&quot;.

There were also boroughs which were controlled not by a particular patron but rather by the Crown, specifically by the departments of state of the Treasury or Admiralty, and which thus returned the candidates nominated by the ministers in charge of those departments.

Some rich individuals controlled several boroughs; for example, the Duke of Newcastle is said to have had seven boroughs &quot;in his pocket&quot;. One of the representatives of a pocket borough was often the man who controlled it, and for this reason they were also referred to as proprietorial boroughs.

Pocket boroughs were seen by their 19th-century owners as a valuable method of ensuring the representation of the landed interest in the House of Commons.

Significantly diminished by the Reform Act 1832, pocket boroughs were for all practical purposes abolished by the Reform Act 1867. This considerably extended the borough franchise and established the principle that each parliamentary constituency should hold roughly the same number of electors. Boundary commissions were set up by subsequent Acts of Parliament to maintain this principle as population movements continued.

==Reform==
In the late 18th century, many political societies, such as the London Corresponding Society and the Society of the Friends of the People, called for parliamentary reform. Specifically, they thought that the rotten borough system was unfair and they called for a more equal distribution of representatives that reflected the population of Britain. However, legislation enacted by William Pitt the Younger caused these societies to disband by making it illegal for them to meet or publish information.

In the 19th century, there were moves toward reform, which broadly meant ending the over-representation of boroughs with few electors. The culmination of the process of Catholic Emancipation in 1829 finally brought the reform issue to a head. The reform movement had a major success in the Reform Act 1832, which disfranchised the 56 boroughs listed below, most of them in the south and west of England. This redistributed representation in Parliament to new major population centres and places with significant industries, which tended to be farther north.

==Contemporary defences==
A substantial number of Tory constituencies were rotten and pocket boroughs, and their right to representation was defended by the successive Tory governments in office between 1807 and 1830. During this period they came under criticism from figures such as Thomas Paine and William Cobbett.

It was argued in defence of such boroughs that they provided stability and were also a means for promising young politicians to enter Parliament, with William Pitt the Elder being cited as a key example. Some MPs claimed that the boroughs should be retained, as Britain had enjoyed periods of prosperity while they were part of the constitution of Parliament.

Because British colonists in the West Indies and British North America, and those in the Indian subcontinent, had no representation of their own at Westminster, representatives of these groups often claimed that rotten boroughs provided opportunities for virtual representation in Parliament for colonial interest groups.

The Tory politician Spencer Perceval asked the nation to look at the system as a whole, saying that if pocket boroughs were disenfranchised, the whole system was liable to collapse.

== Later usage ==

The magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; has a column entitled &quot;Rotten Boroughs&quot;, which lists stories of municipal wrongdoing. In this instance, &quot;boroughs&quot; refers to local government districts rather than parliamentary constituencies.

In his book &quot;The Age of Consent&quot; (2003), George Monbiot compared small island states with one vote in the United Nations General Assembly to &quot;rotten boroughs&quot;.

The term &quot;rotten borough&quot; is sometimes used to disparage electorates used to gain political leverage. In Hong Kong and Macau, functional constituencies (with small voter bases attached to special interests) are often referred to as &quot;rotten boroughs&quot; by long-time columnist Jake van der Kamp. In New Zealand, the term has been used to refer to electorates which, by dint of an agreement for a larger party, have been won by a minor party, enabling that party to gain more seats under the country&#x27;s proportional representation system. &quot;The Spectator&quot; has described the London Borough of Tower Hamlets as a &quot;rotten borough&quot;, and in 2015 &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that Tower Hamlets was to be the subject of an investigation into electoral fraud.

The Electoral Reform Society produced a list of &quot;Rotten Boroughs&quot; for the 2019 United Kingdom local elections, with Fenland District Council at the top.

The Corporation of the City of London has been referred to as the UK&#x27;s Last Rotten Borough due to the fact that only four of its 25 electoral wards hold elections where voting by residents decides the result. The other wards are decided on votes cast by business leaders, not residents, making this the only local government authority in the UK that now lacks a popular franchise.

== In popular culture ==
===Literature===
*In the satirical novel &quot;Melincourt, or Sir Oran Haut-Ton&quot; (1817) by Thomas Love Peacock, an orang-utan named Sir Oran Haut-Ton is elected to parliament by the &quot;ancient and honourable borough of Onevote&quot;. The election of Sir Oran forms part of the hero&#x27;s plan to persuade civilisation to share his belief that orang-utans are a race of human beings who merely lack the power of speech. &quot;The borough of Onevote stood in the middle of a heath, and consisted of a solitary farm, of which the land was so poor and intractable, that it would not have been worth the while of any human being to cultivate it, had not the Duke of Rottenburgh found it very well worth his while to pay his tenant for living there, to keep the honourable borough in existence.&quot; The single voter of the borough, Mr Christopher Corporate, elects two MPs, each of whom &quot;can only be considered as the representative of half of him&quot;.
*In the parliamentary novels of Anthony Trollope pocket boroughs are a recurring theme. John Grey, Phineas Finn, and Lord Silverbridge are all elected by pocket boroughs.
*In Chapter 7 of the novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (published 1847–1848), author William Makepeace Thackeray introduces the fictitious borough of &quot;Queen&#x27;s Crawley&quot;, so named in honour of a stopover in the small Hampshire town of Crawley by Queen Elizabeth I, who, delighted by the quality of the local beer, instantly raised the small town of Crawley into a borough, giving it two members in Parliament. At the time of the story, set in the early 19th century, the place had lost population, so that it was &quot;come down to that condition of borough which used to be denominated rotten&quot;. Queen&#x27;s Crawley re-appears in Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;The Virginians&quot; (published in 1857–1859).
*In Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; (1864–1865), a borough called &quot;Pocket-Breaches&quot; elects Mr. Veneering as its MP.
*The novel &quot;Rotten Borough&quot; was a controversial story published by Oliver Anderson under the pen name Julian Pine in 1937, republished in 1989.
*In Diana Wynne Jones&#x27; 2003 book &quot;The Merlin Conspiracy&quot;, Old Sarum features as a character, with one line being &quot;I&#x27;m a rotten borough, I am.&quot;
*In the Aubrey–Maturin series of sea-faring tales, the pocket borough of Milport (also known as Milford) is initially held by General Aubrey, the father of protagonist Jack Aubrey. In the twelfth novel in the series, &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot; (1988), Jack&#x27;s father dies and the seat is offered to Jack himself by his cousin Edward Norton, the &quot;owner&quot; of the borough. The borough has just seventeen electors, all of whom are tenants of Mr Norton.
*In the 1969 first novel of George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s &quot;The Flashman Papers&quot; series, the eponymous antihero, Harry Flashman, mentions that his father, Buckley Flashman, had been in Parliament, but &quot;they did for him at Reform&quot; – implying that the elder Flashman had sat for a rotten or pocket borough.

===Television===
*In the episode &quot;Dish and Dishonesty&quot; of the BBC television comedy &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;, Edmund Blackadder attempts to bolster support for the Prince Regent in Parliament by getting the incompetent Baldrick elected to the fictional rotten borough of Dunny-on-the-Wold (presumably a reference to Dunwich, with &#x27;dunny&#x27; also being a slang term meaning &#x27;toilet&#x27; in Australian English or &#x27;idiot&#x27; in an obsolete British English dialect). He easily accomplished this with a result of 16,472 to nil, even though the constituency had only one voter (Blackadder himself).

===Video games===
*The video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot; briefly mentions pocket and rotten boroughs in a database entry entitled &quot;Pocket Boroughs&quot;, with Old Sarum identified as one of the worst examples of a pocket borough. In the game, shortly before the Boston Massacre, a non-player character (NPC) can be heard speaking to a group of people on the colonies&#x27; lack of representation in Parliament and listing several rotten boroughs, including Old Sarum.

<text>George Pal (born György Pál Marczincsak; ; February 1, 1908 – May 2, 1980) was a Hungarian-American animator, film director and producer, principally associated with the fantasy and science-fiction genres. He became an American citizen after emigrating from Europe.

He was nominated for Academy Awards (in the category Best Short Subjects, Cartoon) for seven consecutive years (1942–1948) and received an honorary award in 1944. This makes him the second-most nominated Hungarian exile (together with William S. Darling and Ernest Laszlo) after Miklós Rózsa.

==Early life and career==
Pal was born in Cegléd, Hungary, the son of György Pál Marczincsak, Sr. and his wife Mária. He graduated from the Hungarian University of Fine Arts in 1928 (aged 20). From 1928 to 1931, he made films for Hunnia Film Studio of Budapest, Hungary. In 1931, he married Elisabeth &quot;Zsóka&quot; Grandjean, and after moving to Berlin, founded Trickfilm-Studio GmbH Pal und Wittke, with UFA Studios as its main customer from 1931 to 1933. During this time, he patented the Pal-Doll technique (known as &quot;Puppetoons&quot; in the US).

In 1933, he worked in Prague. In 1934, he made cigarette&lt;ref name=&quot;animationresources/george-pal-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; advertisement films in his hotel room in Paris, and was invited by Philips to make two more ad shorts. He started to use Pal-Doll techniques in Eindhoven, in a former butchery, then at villa-studio Suny Home. He made five films before 1939 for the British company Horlicks Malted Milk. In December of that year, aged 32, he emigrated from Europe to the United States, and began work for Paramount Pictures. At this time, his friend Walter Lantz helped him obtain American citizenship.

As an animator, he made the &quot;Puppetoons&quot; series in the 1940s, which led to him being awarded an honorary Oscar in 1943 for &quot;the development of novel methods and techniques in the production of short subjects known as Puppetoons&quot;. Pal then switched to live-action film-making with &quot;The Great Rupert&quot; (1950).

He is best remembered as the producer of several science-fiction and fantasy films in the 1950s and 1960s, such as &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;, four of which were collaborations with director Byron Haskin, including &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1953). He himself directed &quot;Tom Thumb&quot; (1958), &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1960), and &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot; (1962).

==Death==
In May 1980, he died in Beverly Hills, California, of a heart attack at the age of 72, and is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, California. &quot;The Voyage of the Berg&quot;, on which he was working at the time, was never completed.

==Awards and honours==
Pal has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1722 Vine St. In 1980, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences founded the &quot;George Pal Lecture on Fantasy in Film&quot; series in his memory.

George Pal (along with the film &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;) is among the many references to classic science fiction and horror films in the opening theme (&quot;Science Fiction/Double Feature&quot;) of both the stage musical &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; and its cinematic counterpart, &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975).

In 1975, Pal received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, as well as the San Diego Comic Con Inkpot Award.

Pal&#x27;s Puppetoons &quot;Tulips Shall Grow&quot; and &quot;John Henry and the Inky-Poo&quot; (1946) were added to the Library of Congress 1997 and 2015 National Film Registry. One of the Tubby the Tuba models along with a frog and three string instruments were donated to the Smithsonian Institution for the National Museum of American History.

==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive has preserved several of George Pal&#x27;s films, including &quot;Radio Röhren (Valve) Revolution&quot; (1934),&lt;ref name=&quot;awn/GP6&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; an advertising short for Philips, &quot;Jasper and the Beanstalk&quot; (1945), and &quot;John Henry and the Inky Poo&quot; (1946).

<text>Immediate Records was a British record label, started in 1965 by The Rolling Stones&#x27; manager Andrew Loog Oldham and Tony Calder, and concentrating on the London-based blues and R&amp;B scene.

==History==
Immediate Records was started in 1965. Signed musicians included Rod Stewart, P.P. Arnold, songwriter Paul Korda, Billy Nicholls, John Mayall, Savoy Brown, Small Faces, The Nice, Fleetwood Mac, The Groundhogs, Chris Farlowe, Duncan Browne and Humble Pie.

Due to financial problems, the label ceased operations in 1970, and it has been the subject of controversy ever since. This is especially true in regard to unpaid royalties owed to the Small Faces, who made numerous hit recordings for the label between 1967 and 1969. Despite their success, the band received virtually no income from these often re-released records, until legal action finally secured payments from the present licencees in the early 2000s.

According to Small Faces drummer Kenney Jones, most of Immediate Records&#x27; assets and income were embezzled by one of the company&#x27;s senior partners, who allegedly channelled the funds to offshore bank accounts. Paul Korda, who wrote songs such as &quot;The Time Has Come&quot; for P.P. Arnold, was never paid for work done for Immediate Records.

In the US, Immediate Records first set up a deal with MGM Records, who issued three singles (K-13530, K-13567, K-13600) as part of the regular MGM series using regular MGM labels with the Immediate logo on the side of the label. Then Immediate Records set up a short-lived deal with United Artists, who issued two singles using the Immediate moniker (E-1901, E-1902) before signing a deal with CBS to set up a new label series, which picked selective Immediate Records singles (using product codes with the ZS7 prefix) and albums (using Z12) until they had a dispute. Finally, Immediate Records set up a short-lived independent label in the US to issue one single (IMOC-001), Humble Pie’s first album, and The Nice&#x27;s last album before the label entered into liquidation.

In 2008, a comprehensive book about Immediate Records, written by Simon Spence, who &#x27;ghosted&#x27; Andrew Loog Oldham&#x27;s two autobiographies, was published in the UK and US by Black Dog as part of their Labels Unlimited series. A second, amended version has since been published. In 2016, a comprehensive discography with brief organisational history, &quot;The Immediate Discography: The First 20 Years&quot; by recorded music historian, Mark Jones, was published with input from Barry Green, the curator of the official Immediate archive. This book won the Association for Recorded Sound Collections, Best Research in Recorded Rock Music, Best Discography Award, 2017.

Today, Sanctuary Records, owned by BMG Rights Management, controls the Immediate Records catalogue in the United Kingdom. Outside of the UK, Charly Records controls the Immediate catalogue. Charly owns the Immediate Records trade mark.

<doc id="329862" wikidata="Q1133828" url="?curid=329862" title="The Move">
<text>The Move were a British rock band formed in Birmingham in 1965. They scored nine top 20 UK singles in five years, but were among the most popular British bands not to find any real success in the United States. For most of their career The Move were led by guitarist, singer and songwriter Roy Wood. He wrote all the group&#x27;s UK singles and, from 1968, also sang lead vocals on many songs. Initially, the band had four main vocalists (Wood, Carl Wayne, Trevor Burton, and Chris &quot;Ace&quot; Kefford) who divided the lead-vocal duties among themselves.

The Move evolved from several mid-1960s Birmingham-based groups, including Carl Wayne &amp; the Vikings, the Nightriders, and the Mayfair Set. Their name referred to the move various members of these bands made to form the group. Besides Wood, The Move&#x27;s original five-piece line-up in 1965 was drummer Bev Bevan, bassist Ace Kefford, vocalist Carl Wayne, and guitarist Trevor Burton. By 1972, The Move had been reduced to a trio consisting of Wood, Bevan and Jeff Lynne, formerly of the Idle Race. The band&#x27;s later years saw this lineup develop a side project called Electric Light Orchestra, which would go on to achieve major international success after The Move disbanded.

Between 2007 and 2014, Burton and Bevan performed intermittently as &quot;The Move featuring Bev Bevan and Trevor Burton&quot;.

==History==
===Formation and early career===
The Move were formed in December 1965, and played their debut show at the Belfry, Wishaw, on 23 January 1966. The original intentions of Trevor Burton, Ace Kefford and Roy Wood were to start a group from among Birmingham&#x27;s best musicians—along similar lines to the Who. The three played together at jam sessions at Birmingham&#x27;s Cedar Club, and invited Carl Wayne and Bev Bevan to join their new group. After a debut at the Bell Hotel in Stourbridge in January 1966, and further bookings around the Birmingham area, Moody Blues manager Tony Secunda offered to manage them. At the time, The Move mainly played covers of American west coast groups such as the Byrds together with Motown and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll songs. Many of the band&#x27;s selections for their songs came from the extensive record collection of Danny King, a former bandmate of Burton. Although Carl Wayne handled most of the lead vocals, all the band members shared harmonies, and each was allowed at least one lead vocal per show (and often traded lead vocals within specific songs).

Secunda got them a weekly residency at London&#x27;s Marquee Club in 1966, where they appeared dressed as gangsters. Their early career was marked by a series of publicity stunts, high-profile media events and outrageous stage antics masterminded by Secunda; these included Wayne taking an axe to television sets. Wood was uncomfortable with this sensationalism, and many concert promoters responded by banning The Move from live performances, but the stunts succeeded in drawing media attention and concert audiences to the group. Eventually, Secunda also managed to persuade Wood to begin writing songs for the band during his time off. They secured a production contract with independent record producer Denny Cordell, but that was turned into a media event by Secunda, who arranged for the band to sign their contracts on the back of Liz Wilson, a topless female model. Wood wrote their first single, &quot;Night of Fear&quot;, a No. 2 hit on the UK Singles Chart in January 1967, which began The Move&#x27;s practice of musical quotation (in this case, the &quot;1812 Overture&quot; by Tchaikovsky). Their second single, &quot;I Can Hear the Grass Grow&quot;, was another major hit, reaching No. 5 in the UK.

In April 1967, &quot;NME&quot; reported that The Move had offered a £200 reward (equivalent to £ in 2025) for the recovery of the master tapes of ten songs intended for their debut album. The tapes were stolen from their agent&#x27;s car when it was parked in Denmark Street, London. The tapes were found in a skip (dumpster) shortly afterward, but the damage caused to them meant that new mixes and masters would have to be made, resulting in the delayed album only being released in March 1968 instead of the original plan of autumn 1967. Their third single &quot;Flowers in the Rain&quot; was the first chart single played on BBC Radio 1 when it began broadcasting at 7am on 30 September 1967, introduced by Tony Blackburn. The single, which reached No. 2 in the UK, was less guitar-orientated than their previous two singles, and featured a woodwind and string arrangement by Cordell&#x27;s assistant Tony Visconti. The track was released on the re-launched Regal Zonophone label.

===Legal issues===
Without consulting the band, Secunda produced a cartoon postcard to promote the single &quot;Flowers in the Rain&quot;; this showed the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Harold Wilson, in bed with his secretary, Marcia Williams. Wilson sued The Move for libel and the group lost the lawsuit; they had to pay all costs, and all royalties earned by the song were awarded to charities of Wilson&#x27;s choice. The ruling remained in force even after Wilson&#x27;s death in 1995. In the &quot;Family Trees&quot; documentary special on the Birmingham music scene, Wood says that while the band as a whole lost their royalties, it affected him the most, as he wrote the song.

For their fourth single the group had planned to release &quot;Cherry Blossom Clinic&quot;, a lighthearted song about the fantasies of a patient in a mental institution, backed by the satirical &quot;Vote For Me&quot;. However, The Move had been unnerved by their court experiences; they and the record label felt it unwise to pursue such a potentially controversial idea, so the single was shelved. &quot;Vote For Me&quot; remained unreleased until it appeared on retrospective collections from 1997 onwards, while &quot;Cherry Blossom Clinic&quot; became one of the tracks on their first LP, called &quot;Move&quot;.

As a direct consequence of the lawsuit, The Move fired Secunda and hired Don Arden, who had himself recently been fired as manager of the Small Faces. In a 2000 interview, Wayne noted that there had always been a major split within the group about Secunda&#x27;s tactics: &quot;[Secunda] had the animals who would do what he wanted to do in Trevor, Ace, and me—the fiery part of the stage act. I think Roy would obviously qualify this himself, but I believe he was slightly embarrassed by the image and the stunts—but the rest of us weren&#x27;t ... We were always willing to be Secunda puppets.&quot;

===Pop success and dissolution===
During November and December 1967 the group took part in another package tour around the UK, playing two shows a night over sixteen days, as part of an all-star bill that included the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Pink Floyd, the Nice, Eire Apparent, the Outer Limits, Amen Corner, along with then-BBC Radio 1 DJ Pete Drummond. In March 1968, The Move returned to the charts with &quot;Fire Brigade&quot;, another UK Top 3 hit, and the first on which Wood sang lead vocal. A few weeks later, around the time of the LP&#x27;s release, Kefford was let go from the band because of increasing personal problems escalated by drug usage. Wood stated that from the day the band was founded, Kefford had not got along well with any of the other band members. The Move then became a four-piece, in which Burton and (occasionally) Wayne took turns on bass on stage.

The Move were on the bill at the inaugural Isle of Wight Festival on 31 August 1968. In mid-1968, their fifth single &quot;Wild Tiger Woman&quot;, a song acknowledging the group&#x27;s love of Jimi Hendrix (Wood and Burton sang backing vocals on &quot;You Got Me Floatin&#x27;&quot; on the Jimi Hendrix Experience&#x27;s second album, &quot;&quot;), sold poorly and failed to make the UK chart. The Move responded with their most commercially successful song to date, &quot;Blackberry Way&quot; (co-produced by Jimmy Miller), which topped the UK chart in February 1969. Wayne refused to sing the song, so it was recorded as a trio with Wood again handling lead vocal. Richard Tandy played keyboards on &quot;Blackberry Way&quot; and joined the band for a time, playing keyboards live, and switching to bass when Burton was briefly sidelined with a shoulder injury. Upon Burton&#x27;s recovery, Tandy departed to join the Uglys. The new, more pop-oriented musical direction, and the single hitting number one was the last straw for the increasingly disenchanted Burton, who wanted to work in a more hard rock/blues-oriented style, and he left the group in February 1969 after an altercation on stage with Bevan in Sweden.

At this time the band invited Jeff Lynne, a friend of Wood, to join. He turned down the offer down because he was still working toward success in the Idle Race, another Birmingham-based group. It was rumoured in the music press that Hank Marvin of the recently disbanded Shadows had been invited to join The Move. Some years later, Wayne recalled that to be nothing more than a publicity stunt; however, Marvin himself, in an article in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1973 and elsewhere, has maintained that he was approached by Wood and invited to join The Move, but declined because their schedule was too hectic for him. Bevan confirmed in a 2014 interview that the band invited Marvin, but they never expected him to accept. Burton was ultimately replaced in 1969 by Rick Price, another veteran of several Birmingham rock groups, who joined on a temporary, non-contractual basis. Thus, the group in spring 1969 consisted of Wayne (vocals), Wood (guitar, vocals), Bevan (drums), and Price (bass, vocals).

Both Ace Kefford and Trevor Burton struggled commercially after leaving The Move. Kefford formed his own short-lived group, the Ace Kefford Stand, with Cozy Powell on drums. After this, he pursued a solo career and recorded a solo album in 1968, but it remained un-released until 2003 when it appeared as &quot;Ace The Face&quot;. Burton played bass with yet another Birmingham group, the Steve Gibbons Band, was one-third of the short-lived band Balls (with Denny Laine and Alan White), and later fronted his own blues group as lead guitarist.

In October 1969, The Move made their only concert appearances in the US, opening two shows for the Stooges in Detroit, and playing dates in Los Angeles and at the Fillmore West in San Francisco. When neither their US record company nor promoters showed any more interest—the band even had to make their own accommodation &amp; travel arrangements—the remaining proposed tour dates in New York were cancelled and the group returned home. During that period, Arden sold The Move&#x27;s management contract to impresario Peter Walsh, who was at the time also managing the Marmalade. Walsh, who specialised in cabaret acts, began booking the band into cabaret-style venues, which further increased the tension between Wayne and Wood. Bevan later said the others felt &quot;old before their time&quot; when playing cabaret dates. By this point, Wood was openly discussing his desire to form a band playing more eclectic music, including both harder rock and classical instruments, which he tentatively dubbed &quot;The Electric Light Orchestra&quot;.

The Move&#x27;s second album, 1970&#x27;s &quot;Shazam&quot;, continued The Move&#x27;s practice of musical quotation, and of elaborately re-arranged versions of other performers&#x27; songs. &quot;Hello Susie&quot; (a Wood composition), which was a Top 5 hit for Amen Corner in 1969, quoted Booker T. Jones&#x27; and Eddie Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Big Bird&quot;. The album also featured a slightly slower re-recording of &quot;Cherry Blossom Clinic&quot;, an instrumental medley of public domain works, and a cover of a Tom Paxton song, &quot;The Last Thing on My Mind&quot;. Despite such superficial similarities with their past, however, the album represented a clear break from The Move&#x27;s identity as a pop group, reintroducing them as a hard-edged underground band. Burton played bass on a couple of tracks as they had been recorded before he left, although this was not credited at the time.

Well aware that Wood was intent on setting up his new, orchestral rock project, Wayne suggested that Wood concentrate on performing with his new band while continuing to write songs for The Move, which would be reorganized with a lineup consisting of Wayne, Burton, and Kefford; however, his suggestion was rejected by Wood, Bevan and Price, so after getting angry and embarrassed witnessing a fight between Wood and a drunken audience member in Sheffield, Wayne quit the group in January 1970, a month before the release of &quot;Shazam&quot;. He subsequently worked in a variety of musical ventures and appeared on television and radio. In 2000, he replaced Allan Clarke as lead singer of the Hollies and performed with them as lead singer until his death from cancer in 2004.

===Jeff Lynne and a new direction===
Upon Wayne&#x27;s departure, The Move jettisoned Walsh as manager and returned to Arden. Lynne agreed to join the band as a second guitarist and pianist, enthused by Wood&#x27;s ELO idea. Wood also wanted a second songwriter in the band to relieve the pressure on himself. The band&#x27;s first recording with Lynne was a single, &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;. Feeling nervous as the band were about to go on stage for a television spot for the song, Wood spontaneously combed his hair out to make it look wild and applied black-and-white makeup with a star in the middle of his forehead, thus birthing the &quot;Wizzard&quot; image he would use extensively in his post-Move career and helping define The Move&#x27;s image for the rest of their run. Soon afterward, the band toured Ireland and Germany. In August 1970, the group was the lead act at the Knighton Rock Festival, staged in the small Radnorshire town of Knighton. In a radio interview, Bevan stated that The Move had ceased playing all of their prior songs except for &quot;I Can Hear the Grass Grow&quot; and were now playing mostly originals except for a few re-arranged covers (such as &quot;She&#x27;s a Woman&quot;), as the band transitioned from mainstream pop toward progressive rock with its new alignment.

For the rest of the year, The Move concentrated on studio work, because they still owed one more album under their existing contract with Essex Music (David Platz) – which Essex Music was planning to use to set up its own record label, Fly Records. To prepare for their new direction, Wood and Lynne overdubbed multiple instruments, including piano, woodwinds, sitar, and a Chinese cello that Wood had bought. However, before the third album &quot;Looking On&quot; was completed, Arden signed the new Wood-Lynne-Bevan band (without Price, who was not under contract with The Move) to a three-album deal with the Harvest Records division of EMI that included a £25,000 (equivalent to £ in 2025) advance – announced at the time as £100,000 (equivalent to £ in 2025), but still more money – £8,333 each (equivalent to £ in 2025) than the band had seen so far, despite its success. As a result, by the time &quot;Looking On&quot; was released in December 1970, with five songs composed by Wood and two by Lynne, Fly Records had lost interest in it, despite the fact that the album included a No. 7 hit, &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;, which was the band&#x27;s last recording for Regal Zonophone.

The second single from the album, &quot;When Alice Comes Back to the Farm&quot;, failed to chart on Fly. The song intended as the B-side of that single, &quot;10538 Overture&quot;, was ultimately held by the band for its new Electric Light Orchestra project, and Price&#x27;s bass line was deleted and re-recorded by Wood, since Price was not part of the new group. Price in fact was unaware that The Move were working without him, until he heard about new material being made in early 1971. He then pursued other projects, including the band Mongrel, although he later rejoined Wood in Wizzard and the short-lived Wizzo Band. He went on to work in musical management, and also formed the duo Price and Lee with his wife Dianne Lee, formerly of the duo Peters and Lee.

===Toward the first split===

Although Wood, Lynne and Bevan had intended &quot;Looking On&quot; to be the final Move album, Harvest requested that the new group first release a new Move album, in the same vein as &quot;Looking On&quot;, as the first album under its new deal, with the other two albums to be credited to the new group, in order to recoup the advance given to the band. As a result, the band recorded the last Move album and the first Electric Light Orchestra album at the same time—even during the same lengthy recording sessions (due to all the overdubbing by Wood and Lynne). The final Move LP, &quot;Message from the Country&quot;, was released in summer 1971. Wood&#x27;s &quot;Ben Crawley Steel Company&quot; featured a Bevan lead vocal that was modelled on Johnny Cash, while Bevan&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess Me Up&quot; (sung by Wood) paid homage to Elvis Presley, complete with fake Jordanaires. Although Wood and music critics continue to hold &quot;Message from the Country&quot; in high regard, in 2005 Bevan referred to that album as his least favourite from The Move. The album was followed by two more Wood-penned hit singles, &quot;Tonight&quot; and &quot;Chinatown&quot;. For several television appearances behind those songs, The Move added two musicians who became members of the original ELO: Bill Hunt (horns, woodwinds, piano) and a returning Richard Tandy (guitar, bass).

In 1972, after the release of the first Electric Light Orchestra album, The Move released what turned out to be a farewell record, a maxi single consisting of &quot;California Man&quot;, &quot;Ella James&quot; (from &quot;Message&quot;, but a track originally planned by EMI to be their first single on the Harvest label) and &quot;Do Ya&quot;. &quot;California Man&quot;, a No. 7 UK hit—featuring baritone saxophones, a double bass, and a riff borrowed from George Gershwin—was an affectionate tribute to Jerry Lee Lewis (the double bass had Lewis&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Killer&quot;, written on it) and Little Richard, with Lynne and Wood trading verses and lines. Meanwhile, Lynne&#x27;s &quot;Do Ya&quot; became The Move&#x27;s best-known song in the US; it was the only Move song to reach the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart at No. 93. (However, the Electric Light Orchestra&#x27;s remake of &quot;Do Ya&quot;, recorded after Wood&#x27;s departure, was a significant US hit in 1977.) With the release of the album &quot;The Electric Light Orchestra&quot;, within weeks of the last single being released, they appeared on television promoting both The Move&#x27;s last single and ELO&#x27;s debut single (the long-delayed &quot;10538 Overture&quot;) at the same time. Wood and Hunt quit ELO during the early recording sessions of ELO&#x27;s second album, &quot;ELO 2&quot;, which was the group&#x27;s final album under their Harvest Records contract. Wood went on to front the glam rock band Wizzard, as well as releasing a solo album in 1973, &quot;Boulders&quot;, while Lynne, Bevan and Tandy kept touring as ELO and finally achieved international success. &quot;Boulders&quot; was recorded during Wood&#x27;s time with The Move, but its release was held off because Lynne and Bevan wished it not to compete with The Move&#x27;s albums.

===Resurrection and break-up===
A one-off reunion occurred on 28 April 1981, at the Locarno in Birmingham, involving Wood, Bevan, and Kefford. Several other Birmingham bands of the era also reunited for the event, which was a charity fundraiser.

After Wayne&#x27;s death in 2004, Bevan formed the Bev Bevan Band—shortly to be renamed &#x27;Bev Bevan&#x27;s Move&#x27; (with no other past members), in order to capitalise on The Move&#x27;s continuing reputation and belated success. Bevan recruited former ELO Part II colleagues guitarist Phil Bates and keyboard player Neil Lockwood, plus bassist Phil Tree, to play a set on tour composed mostly of classics by The Move. Wood expressed extreme displeasure at that development.

Former Move guitarist Burton joined the band on occasion during 2006, and joined permanently in 2007 (Wayne had tried to broker a reunion between Bevan and Burton before his death, and was to be involved with the new band). Bates departed in July 2007 to re-join ELO Part II (now renamed the Orchestra) and was replaced with Gordon Healer. The Autumn 2007 tour was billed as &quot;the Move featuring Trevor Burton and Bev Bevan&quot;.

In 2014, the band toured as The Move with a lineup consisting of Bevan, Burton, Tree, keyboardist/vocalist Abby Brant, and guitarist/vocalist Tony Kelsey. On 2 May 2014, Bev Bevan announced through a Facebook post that The Move had broken up, and that he and Burton would tour separately with groups called &quot;the Bev Bevan Band&quot; and &quot;the Trevor Burton Band&quot;. In December 2014 the Bev Bevan Band completed their &quot;Stand Up And Rock&quot; tour, which lasted for almost 50 dates, in conjunction with Bevan&#x27;s childhood friend Jasper Carrott. Guests on the tour included Trevor Burton, Geoff Turton and Joy Strachan-Brain, alongside Bevan, Kelsey, Tree and Brant.

In 2016 the band announced that they had reformed again, and were due to perform at The Core Theatre in Solihull, West Midlands, with a line-up consisting of Bevan, Burton, Tree, and Kelsey; however, it was later revealed that the band performing would no longer be billed as &#x27;The Move&#x27;, but as &#x27;Bev Bevan&#x27;s Zing Band&#x27;, and would not feature Burton; with the line-up consisting of Bevan, Tree, and Kelsey, along with a returning Abby Brant, and Geoff Turton on lead vocals.

<text>Andrew Loog Oldham (born 29 January 1944) is an English record producer, talent manager, impresario and author. He was manager and producer of the Rolling Stones from 1963 to 1967, and was noted for his flamboyant style.

==Early life==
Oldham&#x27;s father, Andrew Loog, was a United States Army Air Force lieutenant, a New Orleanian of German descent, who served with the Eighth Air Force. Loog was killed in June 1943 when his B-17 bomber was shot down over the English Channel, and he was buried at the Ardennes American Cemetery and Memorial in Belgium. Oldham&#x27;s Australian-born mother, Celia Oldham, was a nurse and comptometer operator. Oldham attended the Aylesbury School for Boys, Cokethorpe School in Oxfordshire, St Marylebone Grammar School and Wellingborough School in Northamptonshire.

A self-proclaimed hustler, Oldham spent teenage summers swindling tourists in French towns. His interest in the pop culture of the 1960s and the Soho coffeehouse scene led to working for Carnaby Street mod designer John Stephen and later as an assistant to then-emerging fashion designer Mary Quant. Oldham became a publicist for British and American musicians and for producer Joe Meek. Among his projects were stints publicizing both Bob Dylan (on his first UK visit) and the Beatles (for Brian Epstein) in early 1963.

==The Rolling Stones==
In April 1963, a journalist friend recommended that Oldham see a young R&amp;B band named the Rolling Stones. Oldham saw potential in the group being positioned as an &quot;anti-Beatles&quot;—a rougher group compared to the &quot;cuddly moptop&quot; image of the Beatles at that time. Oldham, still a teenager, rapidly acquired a seasoned business partner (Eric Easton) and took over management of the Stones who had been informally represented by Giorgio Gomelsky. Oldham had previously been business partners with Peter Meaden, first manager of the Who, but they had fallen out after getting into several fights. Oldham signed recording rights to the Stones to Decca, targeting A&amp;R head Dick Rowe, who had earlier declined to sign the Beatles.

Among strategies devised and executed by Oldham to propel the group to success: 
*reassigning Ian Stewart from onstage keyboard player in May 1963 to studio-only play. This was to keep their public appearance as a five-man group of slender young men; Oldham said words to the effect that &quot;the kids can&#x27;t count to six&quot; and Stewart was 3–5 years older than four of the five band members. (Although Bill Wyman was almost two years older than Stewart, no-one knew this at the time. Wyman, who wrote for some of the Stones&#x27; early fanzines, even dubbed himself the youngest member. His true age was not revealed until around the time of the band&#x27;s highly successful 1969 American tour.). Stewart stayed on as the road manager and continued to contribute keyboard parts to the band&#x27;s recordings and live performances, and remained an influence.
*encouraging Mick Jagger to be the front man, and to take the spotlight off leader Brian Jones.
*bringing John Lennon and Paul McCartney to the recording studio, which led to their song &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; becoming the Rolling Stones&#x27; second single;
*encouraging Mick Jagger and Keith Richards to start writing their own songs (&quot;As Tears Go By&quot; was their first); 
*promoting a &quot;bad boy&quot; image for the Rolling Stones, in contrast to the Beatles. Oldham generated widely reprinted headlines like &quot;Would You Let Your Sister Go with a Rolling Stone?&quot; and provocative album-cover notes, such as a satirical incitement to fans to mug a blind beggar for funds to buy the album: This quote can be found on the top right on the back of some issues of &quot;The Rolling Stones No. 2&quot; LP. 

Oldham and Eric Easton negotiated a recording contract which was very favourable to themselves. Instead of having the Stones sign directly with Decca they set up a company, Impact Sound, which retained ownership of the group&#x27;s master tapes, which were then leased to an idea learned from Phil Spector. Impact Sound received a 14% royalty from Decca but paid only 6% to the Stones, out of which Oldham and Eric Easton received a 25% management fee.

Oldham produced all Rolling Stones recordings from 1963 until late 1967 despite having no previous experience as a producer. According to the Rolling Stones&#x27; website, accounts regarding the value of his musical input to the Stones recordings vary &quot;from negligible to absolute zero&quot;. Though lacking technical expertise in the studio, it is thought that Oldham was good at seeing the &quot;big picture&quot; of the Rolling Stones&#x27; image and sound. He discovered Marianne Faithfull at a party, giving her Jagger and Richards&#x27; &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; to record. He also developed other studio talent with his Andrew Oldham Orchestra, in which Rolling Stones as well as London session players (including Steve Marriott on harmonica) recorded pop covers and instrumentals. As his success increased, Oldham thrived on a reputation as a garrulous, androgynous gangster who wore makeup and sunglasses and relied on his bodyguard Reg &#x27;The Butcher&#x27; King to threaten rivals.

Oldham put an advert in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; that praised The Righteous Brothers&#x27; version of &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; in an effort to detract attention and sales from Cilla Black&#x27;s competing version.

In 1965, Oldham hired Allen Klein as his business manager. On Oldham&#x27;s behalf Klein renegotiated the Rolling Stones&#x27; contract with Decca, excluding Oldham&#x27;s partner, Eric Easton. However, over the following two years Oldham&#x27;s relations with the Stones were strained by his drug use and inattention to the group&#x27;s needs. When Jagger and Richards were arrested for drug possession in 1967, instead of devising a strategy for their legal defence and public relations, Oldham fled to the United States, leaving Klein to deal with the problem. Oldham was forced to resign as manager of the Rolling Stones in late 1967, and sold his rights to the group&#x27;s music to Allen Klein the following year.

==Immediate Records==
In 1965, Oldham set up Immediate Records, among the first independent labels in the UK. Among the artists that he signed and/or produced or guided were PP Arnold, Chris Farlowe, the Small Faces, John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers, Rod Stewart, the Nice, Jimmy Page, Nico, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Amen Corner, the McCoys, the Strangeloves, Humble Pie and Duncan Browne.

With Arthur Greenslade he was credited as the co-writer of &quot;Headlines&quot;, the B-side of &quot;Ride on Baby&quot; (IM 038), by Chris Farlowe, which was released in October 1966.

After the Small Faces disbanded in 1969, he put together Humble Pie, featuring Steve Marriott (formerly of the Small Faces) and Peter Frampton (formerly of the Herd).

In the 1970s and 1980s, Oldham worked primarily in the United States. He produced Donovan, Gene Pitney and other artists. In the mid-1980s, he made Colombia his home after marrying Esther Farfan, a Colombian model. There he briefly worked with some Colombian bands.

==Later career==
A recording by the Andrew Oldham Orchestra was rediscovered in the 1990s when the Verve used a string loop based on the orchestral arrangement of the Rolling Stones song &quot;The Last Time&quot; in their song &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;; in the ensuing court battle, songwriting royalties for the Verve track were awarded to Allen Klein&#x27;s ABKCO Records, the owner of the copyright for &quot;The Last Time&quot;.

Oldham co-wrote a biography of ABBA in the 1990s and three autobiographies: &quot;Stoned&quot; (1998), &quot;2Stoned&quot; (2001), and &quot;Rolling Stoned&quot; (2011) in which he and other music figures recount his days as a manager, producer and impresario. He was inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.

In 2005, Oldham thanked the Scientology-linked drug rehab organisation Narconon for saving his life from his cocaine addiction. In the same year he was recruited by Steven Van Zandt to host a radio show on Van Zandt&#x27;s &quot;Underground Garage&quot; radio channel heard in North America on Sirius Satellite Radio. Oldham had a three-hour show on weekdays and a four-hour weekend show. In 2006 he collaborated with renowned Argentine musician Charly García for his album &quot;Kill Gil&quot;, which was eventually released in a slightly reworked form in 2010. In 2008, he worked on the production of a new album by Argentine rock band Los Ratones Paranoicos. 

In 2014, Oldham overheard Canadian artist Ché Aimee Dorval singing backup on a friend&#x27;s track he was helping to produce, and he subsequently signed her to his label. In September 2014, Oldham&#x27;s label released Dorval&#x27;s second studio EP, &quot;Volume One&quot;. She was also given two covers to sing on his 2013 album of Rolling Stones songs entitled &quot;Andrew Oldham Orchestra and Friends play the Rolling Stones Songbook Vol. 2&quot;. Dorval sang &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; and &quot;Under My Thumb&quot;.

In 2020, he began his first lectures as a visiting Scholar at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia, Canada.

==&quot;Andrew&#x27;s Blues&quot;==
The song &quot;Andrew&#x27;s Blues&quot;, sung by the Rolling Stones and appearing on the bootleg &quot;Black Box&quot; collection CD1, is a humorous if scathing evocation of Oldham.

==Personal life==

In August 1964 he was quoted in the London &quot;Evening Post&quot; saying that he wanted &#x27;to settle down and marry a girl called Sheila&#x27;. This took place the following month, when he and Sheila Klein were married in Glasgow on the 16 September. They had known each other for over two years. Oldham told Maureen Cleave &#x27;I don&#x27;t know that she has any special qualities, but she&#x27;s just right for me.&#x27;

Oldham has two sons, the elder, Sean, from his marriage to Sheila Klein, and the younger, Maximilian, from his marriage to Esther Farfan.

<doc id="329874" wikidata="Q1160042" url="?curid=329874" title="Daniel Wakefield (judge)">
<text>Daniel Bell Wakefield (27 February 1798 – 8 January 1858) was born in Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, England. He practised law in London and was involved in planning a colony in South Australia. He migrated to New Zealand in 1842 where he served as attorney general for New Munster Province, and as a temporary judge in the Supreme Court.

==Early life==
Daniel Bell Wakefield was the third child and second son of Edward Wakefield (1774–1854), a distinguished surveyor and land agent, and Susanna Crush (1767–1816). His grandmother, Priscilla Wakefield (1751–1832), was a popular author for the young, and one of the introducers of savings banks.
He was the brother of Catherine Gurney Wakefield (1793–1873), the mother of Charles Torlesse (1825–1866); Edward Gibbon Wakefield (1796–1862); Arthur Wakefield (1799–1843); William Hayward Wakefield (1801–1848); John Howard Wakefield (1803–1862); Felix Wakefield (1807–1875); Priscilla Susannah Wakefield (1809–1887); Percy Wakefield (1810–1832); and an unnamed child born in 1813.

In 1824, Daniel Wakefield eloped with and married Selina Elizabeth de Burgh. They had a son, Charles Wakefield. His son Charles and wife Selina Elizabeth both died in 1828. In 1835 Wakefield married Angela Attwood, daughter of Thomas Attwood. They had three children: Selina in 1837, Charles Marcus in 1838, and Alice Mary who was born in New Zealand on 9 October 1849.

After obtaining his law degree, Wakefield practised in London as a member of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He drafted a Bill for the formation of a Colony in South Australia that was accepted by the Secretary of State for the Colonies with some provisos. The Adelaide Street Naming Committee rewarded his efforts by naming Wakefield Street in his honour.

==New Zealand==
Daniel Wakefield immigrated alone under a false name &#x27;Bowler&#x27; to New Zealand in 1842, living first in New Plymouth and later moving to Wellington. In 1844, he was elected as head of a committee charged with forming the local militia. In 1847 he was named attorney general for New Munster Province, a post he held until 1853. He served as temporary judge in the Supreme Court in 1855–56.

He died in Wellington on 8 January 1858.

<doc id="329877" wikidata="Q1465408" url="?curid=329877" title="Taijitu">
<text>In Chinese philosophy, a taijitu () is a symbol or diagram () representing &quot;taiji&quot; () in both its monist (&quot;wuji&quot;) and its dualist (yin and yang) forms in application is a deductive and inductive theoretical model. Such a diagram was first introduced by Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhou Dunyi of the Song Dynasty in his &quot;Taijitu shuo&quot; ().

The &quot;Daozang&quot;, a Taoist canon compiled during the Ming dynasty, has at least half a dozen variants of the &quot;taijitu&quot;. The two most similar are the &quot;Taiji Xiantiandao&quot; and &quot;wujitu&quot; () diagrams, both of which have been extensively studied since the Qing period for their possible connection with Zhou Dunyi&#x27;s &quot;taijitu&quot;.

Ming period author Lai Zhide simplified the &quot;taijitu&quot; to a design of two interlocking spirals with two black-and-white dots superimposed on them, became synonymous with the &quot;Yellow River Map&quot;. This version was represented in Western literature and popular culture in the late 19th century as the &quot;Great Monad&quot;, this depiction became known in English as the &quot;yin-yang symbol&quot; since the 1960s. The contemporary Chinese term for the modern symbol is referred to as &quot;the two-part Taiji diagram&quot; ().

Ornamental patterns with visual similarity to the &quot;yin yang symbol&quot; are found in archaeological artefacts of European prehistory; such designs are sometimes descriptively dubbed &quot;yin yang symbols&quot; in archaeological literature by modern scholars.

== Structure ==
The &quot;taijitu&quot; consists of five parts. Strictly speaking, the &quot;yin and yang symbol&quot;, itself popularly called &quot;taijitu&quot;, represents the second of these five parts of the diagram.

*At the top, an empty circle depicts the absolute (&quot;wuji&quot;). According to Zhou, &quot;wuji&quot; is also a synonym for &quot;taiji&quot;.
*A second circle represents the Taiji as harboring Dualism, yin and yang, represented by filling the circle in a black-and-white pattern. In some diagrams, there is a smaller empty circle at the center of this, representing Emptiness as the foundation of duality.
*Below this second circle is a five-part diagram representing the Five Agents (&quot;Wuxing&quot;), representing a further stage in the differentiation of Unity into Multiplicity. The Five Agents are connected by lines indicating their proper sequence, Wood () → Fire () → Earth () → Metal () → Water ().
*The circle below the Five Agents represents the conjunction of Heaven and Earth, which in turn gives rise to the &quot;ten thousand things&quot;. This stage is also represented by the &quot;bagua&quot;.
*The final circle represents the state of multiplicity, glossed &quot;The ten thousand things are born by transformation&quot; (; simplified )

== History ==

The term &quot;taijitu&quot; in modern Chinese is commonly used to mean the simple &quot;divided circle&quot; form (), but it may refer to any of several schematic diagrams that contain at least one circle with an inner pattern of symmetry representing yin and yang.

=== Song and Yuan eras ===

While the concept of yin and yang dates to Chinese antiquity, the interest in &quot;diagrams&quot; ( &quot;tú&quot;) is an intellectual fashion of Neo-Confucianism during the Song period (11th century), and it declined again in the Ming period, by the 16th century. During the Mongol Empire and Yuan dynasty, Taoist traditions and diagrams were compiled and published in the encyclopedia Shilin Guangji by Chen Yuanjing.

The original description of a &quot;taijitu&quot; is due to Song era philosopher Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073), author of the &quot;Taijitu shuo&quot; (; &quot;Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate&quot;), which became the cornerstone of Neo-Confucianist cosmology. His brief text synthesized aspects of Chinese Buddhism and Taoism with metaphysical discussions in the &quot;Yijing&quot;.

Zhou&#x27;s key terms Wuji and Taiji appear in the opening line , which Adler notes could also be translated &quot;The Supreme Polarity that is Non-Polar&quot;.
Non-polar (&quot;wuji&quot;) and yet Supreme Polarity (&quot;taiji&quot;)! The Supreme Polarity in activity generates &quot;yang&quot;; yet at the limit of activity it is still. In stillness it generates &quot;yin&quot;; yet at the limit of stillness it is also active. Activity and stillness alternate; each is the basis of the other. In distinguishing &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot;, the Two Modes are thereby established. The alternation and combination of &quot;yang&quot; and &quot;yin&quot; generate water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. With these five [phases of] &quot;qi&quot; harmoniously arranged, the Four Seasons proceed through them. The Five Phases are simply &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot;; &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot; are simply the Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-polar. [Yet] in the generation of the Five Phases, each one has its nature.
Instead of usual &quot;Taiji&quot; translations &quot;Supreme Ultimate&quot; or &quot;Supreme Pole&quot;, Adler uses &quot;Supreme Polarity&quot; (see Robinet 1990) because Zhu Xi describes it as the alternating principle of &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot;, and:
insists that &quot;taiji&quot; is not a thing (hence &quot;Supreme Pole&quot; will not do). Thus, for both Zhou and Zhu, &quot;taiji&quot; is the &quot;yin-yang&quot; principle of bipolarity, which is the most fundamental ordering principle, the cosmic &quot;first principle.&quot; &quot;Wuji&quot; as &quot;non-polar&quot; follows from this. 

Since the 12th century, there has been a vigorous discussion in Chinese philosophy regarding the ultimate origin of Zhou Dunyi&#x27;s diagram.
Zhu Xi (12th century) insists that Zhou Dunyi had composed the diagram himself, against the prevailing view that he had received it from Daoist sources. Zhu Xi could not accept a Daoist origin of the design, because it would have undermined the claim of uniqueness attached to the Neo-Confucian concept of &quot;dao&quot;.

=== Ming and Qing eras ===
While Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073) popularized the circular diagram, the introduction of &quot;swirling&quot; patterns first appears in the Ming period and representative of transformation.

Zhao Huiqian (, 1351–1395) was the first to introduce the &quot;swirling&quot; variant of the &quot;taijitu&quot; in his &quot;Liushu benyi&quot; (, 1370s). The diagram is combined with the eight trigrams (&quot;bagua&quot;) and called the &quot;River Chart spontaneously generated by Heaven and Earth&quot;.
By the end of the Ming period, this diagram had become a widespread representation of Chinese cosmology.

The dots were introduced in the later Ming period (replacing the droplet-shapes used earlier, in the 16th century) and are encountered more frequently in the Qing period. The dots represent the seed of yin within yang and the seed of yang within yin; the idea that neither can exist without the other and are never absolute. 

Lai Zhide&#x27;s design is similar to the &quot;gakyil&quot; (&quot;dga&#x27; &#x27;khyil&quot; or &quot;wheel of joy&quot;) symbols of Tibetan Buddhism; but while the Tibetan designs have three or four swirls (representing the Three Jewels or the Four Noble Truths, i.e. as a triskele and a tetraskelion design), Lai Zhide&#x27;s taijitu has two swirls, terminating in a central circle.

== Modern yin-yang symbol ==
The Ming-era design of the &quot;taijitu&quot; of two interlocking spirals was a common yin-yang symbol in the first half of the 20th century. The flag of South Korea, originally introduced as the flag of Joseon era Korea in 1882, shows this symbol in red and blue. This was a modernisation of the older (early 19th century) form of the Bat Quai Do used as the Joseon royal standard.

The symbol is referred to as &quot;taijitu&quot;, simply &quot;taiji&quot; (or the Supreme Ultimate in English), &quot;hetu&quot; or &quot;river diagram&quot;, &quot;the yin-yang circle&quot;, or &quot;wuji,&quot; as &quot;wuji&quot; was viewed synonymously with the artistic and philosophical concept of &quot;taiji&quot; by some Taoists, including Zhou. Zhou viewed the dualistic and paradoxical relationship between the concepts of &quot;taiji&quot; and &quot;wuji&quot;, which were and are often thought to be opposite concepts, as a cosmic riddle important for the &quot;beginning...and ending&quot; of a life.

The names of the &quot;taijitu&quot; are highly subjective and some interpretations of the texts they appear in would only call the principle of &quot;taiji&quot; those names rather than the symbol.

Since the 1960s, the He tu symbol, which combines the two interlocking spirals with two dots, has more commonly been used as a yin-yang symbol.
compare with 

In the standard form of the contemporary symbol, one draws on the diameter of a circle two non-overlapping circles each of which has a diameter equal to the radius of the outer circle. One keeps the line that forms an &quot;S&quot;, and one erases or obscures the other line. In 2008 the design was also described by Isabelle Robinet as a &quot;pair of fishes nestling head to tail against each other&quot;.

The Soyombo symbol of Mongolia may be prior to 1686.
It combines several abstract shapes, including a &quot;Taiji&quot; symbol illustrating the mutual complement of man and woman. In socialist times, it was alternatively interpreted as two fish symbolizing vigilance, because fish never close their eyes.

The modern symbol has also been widely used in martial arts, particularly tai chi, and Jeet Kune Do, since the 1970s.
In this context, it is generally used to represent the interplay between hard and soft techniques.

The dots in the modern &quot;yin-yang symbol&quot; have been given the additional interpretation of &quot;intense interaction&quot; between the complementary principles, i.e. a flux or flow to achieve harmony and balance.

== Similar symbols ==

Similarities can be seen in Neolithic–Eneolithic era Cucuteni–Trypillia culture on the territory of current Ukraine and Romania. Patterns containing ornament looking like Taijitu from archeological artifacts of that culture were displayed in the Ukraine pavilion at the Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China.

The interlocking design is found in artifacts of the European Iron Age. Similar interlocking designs are found in the Americas: Xicalcoliuhqui.

While this design appears to become a standard ornamental motif in Iron-Age Celtic culture by the 3rd century BC, found on a wide variety of artifacts, it is not clear what symbolic value was attached to it. Unlike the Chinese symbol, the Celtic yin-yang lack the element of mutual penetration, and the two halves are not always portrayed in different colors. Comparable designs are also found in Etruscan art.

== In computing ==
Unicode features the &quot;he tu&quot; symbol in the Miscellaneous Symbols block, at code point . The related &quot;double body symbol&quot; is included at , in the Tibetan block.
The Soyombo symbol, which includes a taijitu, is available in Unicode as the sequence U+11A9E 𑪞 + U+11A9F 𑪟 + U+11AA0 𑪠.
