<text>Apollo-Soyuz was the first crewed international space mission, carried out jointly by the United States and the Soviet Union in July 1975. Millions of people around the world watched on television as an American Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet Soyuz capsule. The project, and its &quot;handshake&quot; in space, was a symbol of détente between the two superpowers amid the Cold War.

The Americans officially called the mission the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) while the Soviets called it Experimental flight &quot;Soyuz&quot;–&quot;Apollo&quot; () and Soyuz 19. The unnumbered American spacecraft was left over from canceled Apollo missions and was the last Apollo module to fly.

The mission consisted of three American astronauts (Thomas P. Stafford, Vance D. Brand, and Deke Slayton) and two Soviet cosmonauts (Alexei Leonov and Valery Kubasov) who performed both joint and separate scientific experiments, including an arranged eclipse of the Sun by the Apollo module to allow instruments on the Soyuz to take photographs of the solar corona. The pre-flight work provided useful experience for later joint American–Russian space flights, such as the Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; program and the International Space Station.

Apollo–Soyuz was the last crewed United States spaceflight for nearly six years until the first launch of the Space Shuttle on 12 April 1981, and the last crewed United States spaceflight in a space capsule until Crew Dragon Demo-2 on 30 May 2020.

== Historical background ==

The purpose and catalyst of Apollo–Soyuz was the policy of détente between the two Cold War superpowers: the United States and the Soviet Union. Tensions ran high between the two world superpowers while the United States was engaged in the Vietnam War. Meanwhile, the Soviet press was highly critical of the Apollo space missions, printing &quot;the armed intrusion of the United States and Saigon puppets into Laos is a shameless trampling underfoot of international law&quot; over a photograph of the Apollo 14 launch in 1971. Although Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made the Soviet Union&#x27;s policy of détente official in his 1956 doctrine of peaceful coexistence at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the two nations seemed to be in perpetual conflict.

After John Glenn&#x27;s 1962 orbital flight, an exchange of letters between President John F. Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev led to a series of discussions led by NASA Deputy Administrator Hugh Dryden and Soviet scientist Anatoly Blagonravov. Their 1962 talks led to the Dryden-Blagonravov agreement, which was formalized in October of that year, the same time the two countries were in the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The agreement was formally announced at the United Nations on 5 December 1962. It called for cooperation on the exchange of data from weather satellites, a study of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, and joint tracking of the NASA Echo II balloon satellite. Kennedy interested Khrushchev in a joint crewed Moon landing, but after the assassination of Kennedy in November 1963 and Khrushchev&#x27;s removal from office in October 1964, the competition between the two nations&#x27; crewed space programs heated up, and talk of cooperation became less common, due to tense relations and military implications.

On 19 April, 1971, the USSR launched the first piloted orbital space station, Salyut 1. Meanwhile, the United States had launched the Apollo 14 mission several months prior, the third mission to land on the Moon. Each side gave the other little coverage of their achievements.

With the close of the Vietnam War, relations between the United States and the USSR began to improve, as did the prognosis for a potential cooperative space mission. Apollo–Soyuz was made possible by the thaw in these relations, and the project itself endeavoured to amplify and solidify the improving relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. According to Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev: The Soviet and American spacemen will go up into outer space for the first major joint scientific experiment in the history of mankind. They know that from outer space our planet looks even more beautiful. It is big enough for us to live peacefully on it, but it is too small to be threatened by nuclear war. Thus, both sides recognized ASTP as a political act of peace.

In October 1970, Soviet Academy of Sciences president Mstislav Keldysh responded to NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine&#x27;s letter proposing a cooperative space mission, and there was subsequently a meeting to discuss technical details. At a meeting in January 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s Foreign Policy Adviser Henry Kissinger enthusiastically espoused plans for the mission, and expressed these views to NASA administrator George Low: &quot;As long as you stick to space, do anything you want to do. You are free to commit—in fact, I want you to tell your counterparts in Moscow that the President has sent you on this mission&quot;. 

Both sides had severe criticisms of the other side&#x27;s engineering. Soviet spacecraft were designed with automation in mind; the Lunokhod 1 and Luna 16 were both uncrewed probes, and each Soyuz spacecraft had been designed to minimize risk due to human error by having fewer manual controls with which human operators would have to contend during flight. By contrast, the Apollo spacecraft was designed to be operated by humans and required highly trained astronauts to operate. The Soviet Union criticized the Apollo spacecraft as being &quot;extremely complex and dangerous&quot;.

The Americans also had concerns about Soviet spacecraft. Christopher C. Kraft, director of the Johnson Space Center, criticized the design of the Soyuz: &quot;We in NASA rely on redundant components — if an instrument fails during flight, our crews switch to another in an attempt to continue the mission. Each Soyuz component, however, is designed for a specific function; if one fails, the cosmonauts land as soon as possible. The Apollo vehicle also relied on astronaut piloting to a much greater extent than did the Soyuz machine.&quot; The American astronauts had a very low opinion for the Soyuz spacecraft as it was a craft that was designed to be controlled from the ground. This was in contrast with the Apollo module that was meant to be flown from the capsule. Eventually Glynn Lunney, the Manager of the Apollo–Soyuz Test Program, warned them about talking to the press about their dissatisfaction as they had offended the Soviets. NASA was worried that any slight would cause the Soviets to pull out and the mission to be scrapped.

American and Soviet engineers settled their differences for a possible docking of American and Soviet spacecraft in meetings between June and December 1971 in Houston and Moscow, including Bill Creasy&#x27;s design of the Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS) between the two ships that would allow either to be active or passive during docking.

By April 1972, both the United States and the USSR signed an Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes, committing both the USSR and the United States to the launch of the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project in 1975.

ASTP was particularly significant for the USSR&#x27;s policy of keeping the details of their space program secret from the Soviet people and the world at large, especially Americans. The ASTP was the first Soviet space mission to be televised live during the launch, while in space, and during the landing. Soyuz 19 was also the first Soviet spacecraft to which a foreign flight crew had access before flight; the Apollo crew were permitted to inspect it and the launch and crew training site, which was an unprecedented sharing of information with Americans about any Soviet space program.

Not all reactions to ASTP were positive. Many Americans feared that ASTP was giving the USSR too much credit in their space program, putting them on equal footing with the sophisticated space exploration efforts of NASA. More feared that the apparent peaceful cooperation between the USSR and the United States would lull people into believing there was no conflict at all between the two superpowers. Some Soviet publicists called American critics of the mission &quot;demagogues who stand against scientific cooperation with the USSR&quot;. In general, tensions between the United States and the USSR had softened, and the project set a precedent for future cooperative projects in space.

=== Background ===


The ASTP entailed the docking of an American Apollo command and service module (CSM) with a Soviet Soyuz 7K-TM spacecraft. Although the Soyuz was given a mission designation number (Soyuz 19) as part of the ongoing Soyuz programme, its radio call sign was simply &quot;Soyuz&quot; for the duration of the joint mission. The Apollo mission was not a numbered mission of the Apollo program, and similarly bore the call sign &quot;Apollo.&quot; Despite this, the press and NASA have referred to the mission as &quot;Apollo 18,&quot; but this should not be confused with the canceled lunar mission.

The Apollo spacecraft was launched with a docking module specially designed to enable the two spacecraft to dock with each other, used only once for this mission. The Saturn IB launch vehicle and CSM were surplus material. Like the Apollo Lunar Module, the docking module had to be retrieved from the S-IVB upper-stage of the Saturn IB rocket after launch. The docking module was designed as both an airlock — as the Apollo was pressurized at about using pure oxygen, while the Soyuz used a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at sea level pressure (about ) — and an adapter, since the surplus Apollo hardware used for the ASTP mission was not equipped with the APAS docking collar jointly developed by NASA and the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union for the mission. One end of the docking module was attached to the Apollo using the same &quot;probe-and-drogue&quot; docking mechanism used on the Lunar Module and the Skylab space station, while its other end had the APAS docking collar, which Soyuz 19 carried in place of the standard Soyuz/Salyut system of the time. The APAS collar fitted onto Soyuz 19 was releasable, allowing the two spacecraft to separate in case of malfunction.

The Apollo flew with a three-man crew on board: Tom Stafford, Vance Brand, and Deke Slayton. Stafford had already flown into space three times, including within eight nautical miles of the lunar surface as Commander of Apollo 10, and was the first general officer to fly into space. He was a brigadier general in the United States Air Force at the time of the flight; he would retire with three stars in 1979. Slayton was one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts selected in 1959, but an irregular heartbeat grounded him until 1972. He became head of NASA&#x27;s astronaut office and, after a lengthy medical program, selected himself for this mission. At the time, Slayton was the oldest person to fly in space and the one with the longest gap between selection as an astronaut and first flight into space. Brand, meanwhile, had trained with the Apollo spacecraft during his time as a backup Apollo 15 command module pilot, and had served two stints as a backup Skylab commander. The closest he had come to flying prior to ASTP was as commander for the Skylab Rescue mission mustered to potentially retrieve the crew of Skylab 3 due to a fuel leak on that mission&#x27;s Apollo CSM.

The Soyuz flew with two men: Alexei Leonov and Valery Kubasov. Leonov became the first man to walk in space on Voskhod 2 in March 1965. Kubasov, who flew on Soyuz 6 in 1969, ran some of the earliest space manufacturing experiments. Both were to have flown on the ill-fated Soyuz 11 in 1971 (Leonov as commander, Kubasov as the flight engineer), but were grounded because Kubasov was suspected of having tuberculosis. The two-man crew on the Soyuz was a result of the modifications needed to allow the cosmonauts to wear the Sokol space suit during launch, docking, and reentry.

The ASTP-class Soyuz 7K-TM spacecraft used was a variation of the post-Soyuz 11 two-man design, with the batteries replaced by solar panels enabling &quot;solo&quot; flights (missions not docking to one of the Salyut space stations). It was designed to operate, during the docking phase, at a reduced nitrogen/oxygen pressure of , allowing easier transfers between the Apollo and Soyuz. Six ASTP-class Soyuz spacecraft were built in total, including the one used. Before the actual mission, two craft were launched uncrewed as Kosmos satellites. The third was launched as the crewed Soyuz 16 flight as a rehearsal in order to test the APAS docking mechanism. Another craft was used fully fueled as a &quot;hot backup&quot; at the launch site – later it was disassembled. And the sixth craft was available as a &quot;cold&quot; backup; it was later used on the last &quot;solo&quot; Soyuz flight in 1976, but with the APAS docking adapter replaced by the MKF-6 multispectral camera.

=== Launch and mission ===
The Soyuz and Apollo flights launched within seven-and-a-half hours of each other on 15 July 1975, and docked on 17 July 1975. Three hours later, the two mission commanders, Stafford and Leonov, exchanged the first international handshake in space through the open hatch of the Soyuz. NASA had calculated that the historic handshake would have taken place over the British seaside resort of Bognor Regis, but a delay resulted in its occurrence being over the city of Metz in France. During the first crew exchange, the crews were read a statement from Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, and received a phone call from U.S. President Gerald Ford.

While the two ships were docked, the three Americans and two Soviets conducted joint scientific experiments, exchanged flags and gifts (including tree seeds which were later planted in the two countries), listened to each other&#x27;s music (examples include &quot;Tenderness&quot; by Maya Kristalinskaya and &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Be Friends?&quot; by War), signed certificates, visited each other&#x27;s ships, ate together, and conversed in each other&#x27;s languages. (Because of Stafford&#x27;s pronounced drawl when speaking Russian, Leonov later joked that there were three languages spoken on the mission: Russian, English, and &quot;Oklahomski&quot;.) There were also docking and redocking maneuvers, during which the two spacecraft reversed roles and the Soyuz became the &quot;active&quot; ship.

American scientists developed four of the experiments performed during the mission. Embryologist Jane Oppenheimer analyzed the effects of weightlessness on fish eggs at various stages of development.

After 44 hours together, the two ships separated, and maneuvered to use the Apollo to create an artificial solar eclipse to allow the crew of the Soyuz to take photographs of the solar corona. Another brief docking was made before the ships went their separate ways. The Soviets remained in space for two more days, and the Americans for five, during which the Apollo crew also conducted Earth observation experiments.

=== Re-entry and aftermath ===
The mission was considered a great success, both technically and as a public-relations exercise for both nations. The only serious problem was during reentry and splashdown of the Apollo craft, during which the crew were accidentally exposed to toxic monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide fumes, caused by unignited reaction control system (RCS) hypergolic propellants venting from the spacecraft and reentering a cabin air intake. The RCS was inadvertently left on during descent, and the toxic fumes were sucked into the spacecraft as it drew in outside air. Brand briefly lost consciousness, while Stafford retrieved emergency oxygen masks, put one on Brand, and gave one to Slayton. The three astronauts were hospitalized for two weeks in Honolulu, Hawaii. Brand took responsibility for the mishap; because of high noise levels in the cabin during reentry, he believed he was unable to hear Stafford call off one item of the reentry checklist, the closure of two switches which would have automatically shut off the RCS and begun drogue parachute deployment. These procedures were manually performed later than usual, allowing the ingestion of the propellant fumes through the ventilation system.

The ASTP was the final flight of an Apollo spacecraft. Immediately after the launch of the Apollo spacecraft, preparations began to convert LC-39B and the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center for use by the Space Shuttle, the United States&#x27; next crewed spacecraft program. LC-39A had already been closed after the launch of Skylab.

== Legacy ==
=== Technical ===
A derivative (but mechanically incompatible) docking collar, APAS-89, was launched as part of the Kristall module of the Soviet Mir space station. Originally intended as the docking port for the Buran Soviet space shuttle, the APAS-89 unit was used for the next Russian-American docking mission, STS-71, twenty years later as part of the Shuttle–Mir program (though not before the docking port was tested by the last APAS-equipped Soyuz, Soyuz TM-16, in 1993).

The American Space Shuttle continued to use the same APAS-89 docking hardware through the end of the Space Shuttle program to dock to Mir and then the International Space Station, the latter through the Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMAs).

The PMAs are equipped with the later APAS-95 adapters, which differ from the APAS-89 adapters in that they are no longer androgynous; while compatible with the APAS-89 docking collars, they are not capable of acting as the &quot;active&quot; partner in docking.

The first PMA, PMA-1, remains in use as the interface connecting the Russian-built, NASA-owned Zarya module to the US segment of the ISS (USOS), and so the APAS continues in use to this day (2024).

=== Political ===
Apollo–Soyuz was the first joint US–Soviet space mission. At the time it was thought that space would become either more international or competitive as a result, but it became both. The mission became symbolic of each country&#x27;s goals of scientific cooperation, while their news reports downplayed the technical prowess of the other. Soviet press implied that it was leading the United States in space flight, tying it to the Marxist–Leninist ideology, while the United States reported that the Soyuz was technically primitive. High-profile space cooperation declined after the successful mission and became entangled in linkage politics, but it set a precedent of cooperation that continued in the Shuttle–Mir Program.

=== Cultural ===
The American and Soviet commanders, Stafford and Leonov, became lasting friends. Leonov was the godfather of Stafford&#x27;s younger children. Stafford gave a eulogy at Leonov&#x27;s funeral in October 2019.

An asteroid, 2228 Soyuz-Apollo, discovered in 1977 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Chernykh, is named after the mission.

To commemorate Apollo–Soyuz, renowned British/Irish bartender Joe Gilmore of The Savoy Hotel&#x27;s American Bar created the &#x27;Link-Up&#x27; cocktail. When the astronauts were told the cocktail was being flown out from London to be enjoyed on their return, they said, &quot;Tell Joe we want it up here&quot;.

===Scientific===
The Apollo craft carried the SAG telescope designed to observe in the extreme ultraviolet. Across several orbits of observing the instrument discovered two ultraviolet sources; HZ 43 and FEIGE 24, both of which were White dwarfs. Other stars observed included, Proxima Centauri (a Red Dwarf), SS Cygni (a Binary star), and Sirius (also a Binary star). A third possible discovery was an unknown object in the Pavo constellation. The star HD 192273 was later suggested as a candidate for the Pavo observation but further study concluded that the star’s distance and spectral class made this unlikely.

== Spacecraft locations ==


The Apollo command module from the mission is on display at the California Science Center in Los Angeles. The descent module of Soyuz 19 is on display at the RKK Energiya museum in Korolyov, Russia.

A display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. shows the docked Apollo/Soyuz configuration. The display is made up of the unflown Apollo Command and Service Module 105 (used for vibration testing for the Skylab program), the back-up Docking Module, and an unflown Soyuz spacecraft, on loan from the Russian government. 

== Commemorations ==
The United States Postal Service issued the Apollo–Soyuz commemorative stamps, honoring the United States–Soviet link up in space, on 15 July 1975, the day of the launch.

The remaining crew&#x27;s most recent reunion was on 16 July 2010, when Leonov, Kubasov, Stafford, and Brand met at an Omega timepiece store in New York City. All except Leonov participated in a public roundtable that evening. Omega had produced several watches to be used on the mission.

=== Monument ===
A large Soyuz–Apollo monument was constructed outside the Soviet (now Russian) space control center RKA Mission Control Center (Russian acronym: TsUP) in Moscow. It consisted of a metal scale model of Earth overarched by an arc terminating in the joined Soyuz–Apollo spacecraft. It was damaged when a vehicle collided with it in the late 1990s, and was removed for repairs.

===Mission Control Center===
The mission control room that hosted the Americans in Korolyov, Russia, was preserved as a memorial to the Soyuz–Apollo mission.

== Program cost ==
The United States spent US$245 million (equal to $ today) on the Apollo–Soyuz project and spacecraft.

The amount of money the Soviet Union spent on the ASTP is unknown but reportedly constituted a &quot;significant portion.&quot;

<text>The Shocker (Herman Schultz) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and John Romita Sr, the character debuted in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #46 in March 1967. He is usually depicted as an enemy of the superhero Spider-Man, and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery.

Schultz was originally a self-taught engineer and renowned safe cracker who invented a pair of gauntlets capable of producing powerful vibrational shock waves. He incorporated these gauntlets into a protective battlesuit and became a mercenary for hire. As the Shocker, Schultz quickly rose in New York City&#x27;s criminal underworld and has been employed by various crime lords, which has often put him into conflict with Spider-Man. One notable trait that differentiates the Shocker from most other Spider-Man villains is his pursuit of wealth and a comfortable life rather than revenge or chaos. As a result, he has sometimes put aside his differences with Spider-Man and has helped him or other heroes when it was in his best interest.
The character was ranked as Spider-Man&#x27;s 23rd greatest enemy by IGN. The Shocker has been adapted from the comics into various forms of media, having been voiced by Jim Cummings in &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot;, Jeff Bennett in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, and David B. Mitchell in the video game &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. Two iterations of the character were featured in the 2017 Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot;, with Herman Schultz portrayed by Bokeem Woodbine and [[Montana (comics)|Jackson Brice]] portrayed by Logan Marshall-Green.

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #46 (March 1967) and was created by Stan Lee and John Romita Sr.

In an interview, Romita discussed how he designed the character, &quot;I used a lot of very subliminal feeling. While designing the Shocker costume, for some reason, I thought &#x27;cushion&#x27; and &#x27;quilt.&#x27; I&#x27;m thinking, if the guy has a shocking power and vibrates buildings so they fell apart by shaking them, then there&#x27;s got to be some kind of cushion effect, and so, subliminally, I did it.&quot;

He appeared as a regular character in &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; from issue #157 to 162, when he deserted the team. He was also one of the main characters in &quot;The Superior Foes of Spider-Man&quot; comic series.

==Fictional character biography==
Herman Schultz was born in New York City. He was a high school who had brilliant talents as both an inventor and an engineer. Instead of using such talents to gain legitimate employment, he became a successful burglar and the world&#x27;s best safe-cracker (according to him in later stories). After finally being caught and incarcerated for his crimes, he developed a pair of gauntlets designed to shoot air blasts, vibrating at high frequency. Schultz uses his gauntlets to escape from prison and becomes the supervillain known as &quot;the Shocker&quot;. He defeats Spider-Man in their first confrontation (Spider-Man was at a disadvantage due to having a bad left arm sprain from an earlier battle with the Lizard) during a robbery. While robbing a bank, he was later beaten and sent back to prison after Spider-Man pinned Schultz&#x27;s thumbs away from the gauntlets&#x27; triggers with his webbing and then knocked him out.

Shocker later stole an ancient stone tablet with an inscription for a formula that could restore youth, that had been earlier stolen by the Kingpin. Likely Schultz&#x27;s most ambitious solo exploit was his attempt to hold New York City for ransom by blacking out various electrical grids to spell out his name, and extort one million dollars from the city. He then made one million dollars by harassing a stock broker. Shocker later joined Egghead&#x27;s Masters of Evil (with Radioactive Man, Tiger Shark, Moonstone, and Beetle) to incriminate Dr. Henry Pym, then on trial for treason. The Masters battled the Avengers in this encounter; Shocker was brainwashed and purposely abandoned by Egghead to deliver a false testimony, and subsequently cooperated with the authorities in exonerating the ex-Avenger. Shocker was later hired by the Nazi war criminal Baron Von Lundt to kill Dominic Fortune, and built the vibro-shock units into his entire uniform to do so. Shocker was hired by the Chameleon and Hammerhead to induce Electro to join their organization. Shocker later attempted to steal thousands of charity dollars at the celebrity fund raiser for the New York City Library. He&#x27;s captured by Spider-Man and sent to prison. He later escapes with the help of fellow inmate Boomerang. By this time, he&#x27;s developed severe confidence issues and has become terrified that the Scourge of the Underworld is going to kill him. A tipping point occurs when Spider-Man apprehends him and seems to not take him seriously. Enraged, Shocker defeats Spider-Man and is about to finish him off when a Scourge imposter intervenes, causing Shocker to flee. When he next appeared his confidence issues are gone. He aims to hunt down Scourge himself and kill him first.

Shocker has proven to be a constant presence among Spider-Man&#x27;s gallery of enemies. He often works as a member of a team (including Hobgoblin&#x27;s Sinister Seven, Norman Osborn&#x27;s Sinister Twelve, Doctor Octopus&#x27;s most recent Sinister Six, and the Masters of Evil) or in partnership with at least one other villain. Previous alliances include Boomerang, the Beetle, Rhino, Leila Davis, Hydro-Man, and Speed Demon (all of which made up the Sinister Syndicate), and the Trapster, Constrictor and Jack O&#x27;Lantern. He also teamed up with a large group of villains during the Acts of Vengeance, when he helped them unsuccessfully attack the Fantastic Four. During one of his team-ups with Doctor Octopus, he participated in a raid on Avengers Mansion, hoping to help conquer it as the heroes were distracted by the events of the Infinity War. Shocker was forced to fight alongside the heroes called the Guardians of the Galaxy when alien doubles of both sides attacked. After the doubles stopped coming, Doctor Octopus tried to order Shocker and the others to continue fighting the heroes but instead, they turned on Doctor Octopus. They did not wish to harm the people who had helped save their lives. Shocker helped chase Doctor Octopus out of the building.

At one point in his career, Shocker became increasingly paranoid that he was on the Scourge of the Underworld&#x27;s hit list, even though there was no actual proof that he was. He thus started seeking ways to become more powerful, hoping to thwart any attempt on his life by the vigilante group. Shocker somehow acquired actual superhuman vibration powers. As he becomes more powerful, he realizes that the new powers will eventually kill him. He seeks a vibrational harness to cure himself and is aided by Night Thrasher and Spider-Man. Shocker has had Spider-Man on the ropes on several occasions, with timely interventions often saving Spider-Man. Individuals thwarting Shocker&#x27;s victories over Spider-Man include security guards, Dominic Fortune, and even a Scourge of the Underworld impostor. Shocker has also let Spider-Man go on a few occasions, the first being when he found Spider-Man incapacitated with a bout of vertigo on the outside of a tall building. He doesn&#x27;t kill Spider-Man, thinking it an unworthy end, but doesn&#x27;t help him either. Shocker found another moment of victory over Spider-Man when he teamed up with the Trapster. Sent by the Friends of Humanity to assassinate Paul Stacy, the duo managed to glue Stacy and Spider-Man together and corner them, only to be called off their assignment moments before finishing them off. Shocker would later turn on the Trapster at the behest of Osborn of having Trapster eliminated as a potential witness against his recent attempt to frame Spider-Man for murder. Preparing to kill the resigned Trapster in an alley, he was attacked and rendered unconscious at the last minute by Spider-Man (then disguised under the alias Dusk).

Shocker has a run-in with Iron Man on a subway car in NYC. Shocker is hired by the Golem, along with Constrictor and Jack O&#x27;Lantern, to protect a diamond delivery. He battles Hood. Shocker was terminated as a freelance agent by Hammer Industries and captured by Spider-Man while trying to rob a federal bank alongside Hydro-Man. He accidentally evaporates his water-based ally with a misplaced vibration. He allied himself with Speed Demon of the New Thunderbolts to break into a particularly well-guarded safe. Though the police arrived at his hide-out in quick pursuit, he was saved by Speed Demon dashing in and stealing both the loot and Shocker&#x27;s weapons, removing all traces of evidence (and, unfortunately for Shocker, also keeping the money to fund the Thunderbolts&#x27; further activities).

Shocker plays a small role in the &quot;Secret War&quot; crossover event where he was among the villains used by Lucia von Bardas to attack New York.

A new version of the Sinister Six, with Shocker as a member, bands together during the &quot;Civil War&quot; but were stopped by Captain America and his Secret Avengers.

Shocker was among the group of villains that the Punisher attempts to kill at the wake of the recently deceased Stilt-Man that was held at the Bar with No Name. He survives the poisoning and fire-bombing.

Shocker was shown to have partially reformed the Sinister Syndicate alongside Hydro-Man and Boomerang. This group attempts to rob Baily&#x27;s Auction House but are interrupted by Spider-Man and then Initiative members War Machine and Komodo. The latter are there to neutralize Spider-Man. The trio escapes, only to be found and attacked by government operatives called &#x27;Scarlet Spiders&#x27;.

In his first &quot;Brand New Day&quot; appearance, he is shown to have been hired by a mobster to take out a subway train wagon full of jurors. After a brief battle with Spider-Man, he is knocked unconscious while Spider-Man uses his gauntlets to destroy rubble blocking the path. Although he seems cooperative at first, as soon as he is secured by Spider-Man, he activates a powerful shock in his gauntlets through his belt, causing the main exit to collapse and allowing him to escape. On their way to collect money from bets on superhero fights, Shocker and Boomerang discover the dead body of &quot;the Bookie&quot;.

During the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, Shocker appeared as a member of Hood&#x27;s crime syndicate.

During the &quot;Origin of the Species&quot; storyline, Shocker is invited by Doctor Octopus to rejoin the reestablished Sinister Six, where he exchange for securing some specific items. He and Tombstone went after Menace&#x27;s infant in the restaurant shop, until Spider-Man interfered. After he passes out from his fight, the police arrive but Shocker is carried away by Tombstone who escapes. When Spider-Man goes on a rampage against the villains after the infant was stolen by Chameleon, Shocker is attacked in his hideout and threatens Shocker to tell him everything about the villains&#x27; whereabouts. Shocker tells Spider-Man that Chameleon has the baby at the Kravinoff Mansion.

Shocker was then seen in the Raft due to a popular online vote at Marvel.com and was selected to join the Thunderbolts&#x27;s new Beta team called the Underbolts where it was revealed that MACH-V has put his name on the list of likely candidates.

During the &quot;Spider-Island&quot; storyline, Spider-Man and Carlie Cooper encounter a six-armed Shocker. During the fight, Shocker reveals that he wants the money so that Mad Thinker can cure him. Shocker then pulls off his mask to reveal that he&#x27;s slowly mutating into a spider-like creature.

Shocker later appeared as a member of Villains for Hire (a villain counterpart of Heroes for Hire).

As part of the &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot;, Shocker appears as a member of the latest incarnation of the Sinister Six, consisting of himself, Boomerang, Lady Beetle, Speed Demon, Overdrive, and the Living Brain.

Shocker features as one of the main characters in &quot;The Superior Foes of Spider-Man&quot;, which concludes with Silvermane crowning him the new don of the New York underworld after Shocker saves dozens of mobsters by singlehandedly defeating the Punisher. Shocker shares a meal with She-Hulk while they discuss a memory Jennifer cannot remember, and Herman helps her by telling what little he remembers because she treated him well and bought him lunch, whereas other heroes would just beat him up and ask questions later. It was then revealed that a villain named Nighteater created a spell that would murder hundreds of people but made everyone think he was not a villain, but was instead a hero named Nightwatch, because it was more profitable. When Shocker found out, he assisted She-Hulk in defeating Nightwatch. When asked by Nightwatch why Shocker was angry after already getting his cut, even if he had forgotten, Shocker said that it was because he wanted to be a hero too.

When New York City was covered in the Darkforce dome by the evil Captain America during the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Shocker and Scorpia took advantage of this by robbing a bank but was stopped by Rogue. When the Shocker accidentally crushes the ground beneath them, they were surrounded by Darkforce creatures and had no choice but to work together. When they finally beat the biggest of the creatures, Rogue flies away. Herman Schultz is being tried for his crimes as the Shocker and Rogue volunteers herself as a character witness. Rogue said that the Shocker, from her experience when she was fighting Darkforce monsters alongside him, was smart, kind and courageous, and given the chance, could redeem himself.

During the &quot;Sinister War&quot; storyline, Shocker was with Boomerang, Hydro-Man, Speed Demon, and Overdrive when they were used by Kindred to attack Spider-Man.

During the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot; storyline, Shocker was seen as a member of Mayor Wilson Fisk&#x27;s incarnation of the Thunderbolts at the time when Mayor Fisk made superhero activities illegal. After defeating Darkhawk, Shocker tried to get Luke Cage and Jessica Jones to surrender only to be defeated by them.

During the &quot;Gang War&quot; storyline, Shocker is among the villains hired by Hobgoblin to guard his hideout and are attacked by Scorpion, Shift, and Starling. During Shocker&#x27;s fight with Scorpion, Shocker was among the villains persuaded by him to turn against Hobgoblin.

==Characterization==
===Skills and equipment===
The Shocker wears a pair of gauntlets he designed with vibro-shock units known as &quot;vibro-smashers&quot; that, when activated by a pump-action thumb trigger, can project a concentrated blast of compressed air that vibrates at an intense frequency. This creates a series of rapid-succession high-pressure air blasts that result in a series of powerful impacts. This allows Shocker to both effectively throw long range vibrational punches from a distance, creating destructive vibrations that can crumble solid concrete and cause extensive damage to the human body and its internal organs, as well as throw shock waves which vibrate the structure of something to weaken or destroy it. A lesser known ability of the gauntlets allows Shocker to make incredible leaps, by directing the air blasts toward the ground in front of him. Holding the thumb triggers down for an extended period of time increases the intensity, speed, and even spread of the air blasts.

The feedback from the Shocker&#x27;s gauntlets is extremely intense (the initial test almost killed him). To guard himself from this, he developed a protective costume consisting largely of yellow quilt patches designed to absorb the shock. The costume is made of foam-lined synthetic fabric which absorbs all vibrations and establishes a vibrational shield which deflects normal blows and allows him to slip from any grasp. The costume&#x27;s appearance has been the source of ridicule on the part of Spider-Man and other characters. How fellow villain the Looter was able to once wield one of the gauntlets without wearing a protective costume and suffering injury is unclear, though his super strength and durability were presumably a factor. Despite having no superhuman abilities, his vibrating suit and gauntlets enable him to trade blows with Spider-Man.

Around the year 2000 (real time), Herman Schultz began upgrading the abilities of his costume and weapons. His suit now contains a number of built-in shock units, which throw up a protective vibrational field when triggered by accompanying motion detectors. Besides deflecting most physical blows, this makes it difficult, if not impossible for someone to physically assault or grasp him by surprise. This power upgrade was accompanied by a much bulkier and more protective looking costume (as designed by artist John Romita, Jr.).

He also recently allowed Hammer Industries to drastically upgrade the power of his gauntlets. However, not trusting to share the whole of his secrets (and thus become what he perceives as expendable), he refused Hammer&#x27;s technicians access to his actual costume, which (at least at the time) likely wasn&#x27;t providing him with thorough protection from the feedback of the upgraded gauntlets (he cited nosebleeds as a risk he was willing to take).

Shocker has since appeared repeatedly in his original costume and minus the redesigned super-gauntlets provided to him by Hammer Industries. Whether or not this means he has found a way to retain his upgraded abilities in his old costume or whether he no longer uses them remains in question.

Continued use of the gauntlets has had a negative effect on Shocker&#x27;s body and he admits that he rarely has a day when he gets out of bed without his back hurting.

===Personality===
While most Spider-Man villains usually shift from their original goals to a vendetta against Spider-Man, the Shocker is still concerned largely with making a living and protecting his reputation. As such, the character is usually portrayed as behaving in a more professional manner than the majority of his maniacal peers.

Shocker has a notably rational personality among Spider-Man&#x27;s enemies. He has often been shown to recognize his own limitations amongst a universe of super-powered individuals. He was once stricken with chronic anxiety and paranoia (in the &quot;Deadly Foes of Spider-Man&quot; series) stemming from his fears about being targeted by anti-heroes Scourge and the Punisher (surprisingly, he has survived encounters with both). While partnered with the Trapster, he mentions that he engages in psychotherapy.

In recent stories (&quot;Venomous&quot; and &quot;Senseless Violence&quot;), Shocker has revealed that he is extremely frustrated with his place in life, not wanting to be known as a punching bag for superheroes like Spider-Man. He unsuccessfully attempts to purchase the Venom symbiote at an auction to gain some respect. When temporarily partnered with Hydro-Man, he rebukes Morrie&#x27;s suggestion that they go kill Spider-Man, being far more interested in more financially lucrative ventures and trying to rebuild a professional reputation.

==Other characters named Shocker==
===Dalt Kendall===
During the Golden Age, Dalt Kendall was a brilliant scientist who was obsessed with electric eels. He began breeding a pair of gigantic electric eels in his secret lab, slowly exposing himself to their electricity. Over time, his body developed an immunity to electricity and the ability to discharge electricity at will. Using his new powers, he began a life of crime, calling himself the Shocker. Madeline Joyce witnessed his first robbery and in her costumed identity of Miss America, attempted to apprehend the Shocker. Shocker managed to evade capture several times before Miss America finally discovered the entrance to his secret lab. Once he discovered she was in his hideout, Shocker began to divulge the source of his powers before taking the opportunity to attack the heroine. Miss America then tricked him into thinking she was unconscious and struck back at him, punching him into his pet electric eel aquarium. Somehow, the electric eel&#x27;s electricity killed him while unconscious even though he had the ability to harmlessly absorb their electricity otherwise.

===Randall Darby===

Randall Darby is a mutant who took the Shocker codename after being recruited by Magneto to become a member of his Brotherhood of Mutants. After Magneto abandoned him, Darby changes his code name to Paralyzer.

<text>Guards! Guards! is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the eighth in the &quot;Discworld&quot; series, first published in 1989. It is the first novel about the Ankh-Morpork City Watch. The first &quot;Discworld&quot; point-and-click adventure game borrowed heavily from the plot of &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;

==Plot==
A secret monastic order plots to overthrow the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork and install a puppet monarch under the control of the Order. They summon a dragon to terrorise the city and plan to have the puppet &quot;slay&quot; the dragon and claim to be the lost heir of the defunct royal house.

The Night Watch, which is generally seen as both corrupt and incompetent, starts to change with the arrival of idealistic new recruit Carrot Ironfoundersson, a human orphan raised by dwarfish parents. When the Librarian of the Unseen University (an orangutan) reports a book of magic stolen, Vimes links the theft to the dragon&#x27;s appearances. The Watch&#x27;s investigation makes the acquaintance of Lady Sybil Ramkin, who breeds small swamp dragons, and gives an underdeveloped dragon named Errol to the Watch as a mascot.

At first, the plot works flawlessly. The Patrician is ousted in favor of the new king, but the banished dragon returns and makes itself king, demanding gold and virgin sacrifices, and prepares to wage war against Ankh-Morpork&#x27;s neighbours for the further acquisition of both (which the citizenry generally seem to approve of).

Vimes confronts his old childhood friend, the Patrician&#x27;s Secretary Lupine Wonse, having figured out that he is the Supreme Grand Master, and responsible for the dragon&#x27;s appearance. Vimes is imprisoned in the same cell as the Patrician. Vimes escapes with the help of the Librarian and runs to rescue Sybil, chosen as the first sacrificed maiden. After the remaining Watch fail to kill the king through a &#x27;million-to-one chance&#x27; arrowshot, Errol fights it, and knocks it from the sky. The assembled crowd closes in to kill the king, and Sybil pleads for the dragon&#x27;s life. Carrot arrests it, but Errol lets it escape. The dragon is in fact female, and the battle between them was a courtship ritual.

Vimes arrests Wonse, as he tries to summon another dragon, telling Carrot to &quot;throw the book at him&quot;. Wonse falls to his death after the very literal Carrot hits him with a thrown copy of &quot;Laws and Ordinances of Ankh-Morpork&quot;.

The Patrician is reinstated as ruler of Ankh-Morpork, and offers the Watch anything they want as a reward. They ask only for a modest pay raise, a new tea kettle, and a dartboard. However, since the Watch&#x27;s original station house was destroyed by the dragon, Lady Ramkin donates her childhood home at Pseudopolis Yard to serve as the new one. She also proposes marriage to Vimes, who, much to his own surprise, accepts.

==Reception==
John Clute in 1990 wrote that the book&#x27;s serious topics risked damaging the Discworld&#x27;s comedic potential: &quot;Pratchett writes with something like genius&quot;, and particularly faulted Lord Vetinari&#x27;s monologue on the nature of evil (which Clute described as Realpolitik and Weltschmerz): although he conceded that the monologue had been skilfully written, and he felt that it &quot;has all the ring of another sphere of discourse&quot; and &quot;comes close to shattering the comic pulse of the Discworld&quot;.

&quot;NPR&quot; described &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; as a &quot;solid entryway&quot; to the Discworld novels.

In later years, &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; has increasingly become a go-to starting point for new readers (next to Mort), and an early example of the more intricate political and social commentary that many later discworld books would feature.

==Adaptations==
The novel has been adapted as:
* a six-episode serial on BBC Radio 4 (23 November - 28 December 1992) dramatised by Michael Butt and starring John Wood (Vimes), Melvyn Hayes (Nobby), Robert Gwilym (Carrot), Crawford Logan (Vetinari), Helen Atkinson-Wood (Lady Ramkin), Brett Usher (Supreme Grand Master), and Martin Jarvis (narrator).
* a stage play for the amateur stage scripted by Stephen Briggs (1993) (script later published in book form 1997).
* a professional stage play scripted by Geoffrey Cush and starring Paul Darrow (1998).
* a &quot;Big Comic&quot; (Graphic novel) drawn by Graham Higgins and based on Briggs&#x27; script (2000).
* an audio play presented live at Dragon*Con in 2001, adapted by David Benedict and performed by the ARTC (Atlanta Radio Theatre Company). In appreciation, the ARTC made a donation to the Orangutan Foundation International.
* a video game loosely based on the plot of the book, with Rincewind substituted for Sam Vimes.
* a Board Game - officially launched at Titancon, Belfast 24 September 2011 by Backspindle Games (Designers: Leonard Boyd &amp; David Brashaw) in conjunction with Z-Man Games, USA.

<text>Femforce is a comic book published by AC Comics that began publication in 1985, detailing the adventures of the titular team: the &quot;Federal Emergency Missions Force&quot; or &quot;Femforce&quot;, some of them original creations, while others originated in the 1940s and 1950s, lapsing into the public domain by the time &quot;Femforce&quot; was published. The team are, as their name implies, all superheroines, and are the first and the longest running all-women &#x27;super-team&#x27;. The series has passed 200 issues, a significant milestone for an independent comic book company. Writers on the book have included Bill Black, Stephanie Sanderson, Mark Heike, Paul Monsky, Enrico Teodorani and Francesca Paolucci. Artists on the book have included Bill Black, Stephanie Sanderson, Mark Heike, Brad Gorby, Jeff Austin, Dave Roberts and Rik Levins.

==Fictional history==
The team was formed by Miss Victory, She Cat, the Blue Bulleteer and the original Rio Rita in the 1940s during World War II, in which they fought as aides to the allied forces. After the war, Rio Rita retired. The rest of the Femforce continued to operate as an offshoot of the U.S. government, most of them kept young by their super-powers. In 1960, Blue Bulleteer was assaulted by thugs and nearly killed but was luckily taken in by Azagoth, a being from another dimension. When she returned from Azagoth&#x27;s home dimension as the sorceress Nightveil she brought a new ally, the reality-altering Synn, with her.

Later members in the 1980s were weapons mistress Colt and the environmentalist Tara. The group also met up with the granddaughter of their old member Rio Rita, who was using the same codename as her grandmother though she never officially joined the team. When a villain, Black Commando, forced Ms. Victory to overdose on V-45, the serum that gave her powers, it altered her mind and she became a renegade named &#x27;Rad&#x27;. and was replaced on the team by her now-adult daughter Jennifer, who became a second Ms. Victory. Once her mother returned and took over as leader of the team again, Jennifer&#x27;s life gradually grew worse before she herself became a second Rad. In the 1990s, new members included the alien warrior Stardust, the ghost Firebeam, electric-powered Rayda, and briefly, the heroines Dragonfly and Thunderfox.

The Femforce&#x27;s military liaison was initially a man named General Gordon, an old school and somewhat sexist soldier who occasionally clashed with his female allies. Gordon was later replaced by General Roberta Strock who was considerably friendlier to the Femforce&#x27;s cause. Other allies have included the Sentinels of Justice and the so-called &quot;Vault of Heroes&quot;, a group of costumed crimefighters placed in suspended animation in the 1940s by the mystic, Dr. Weird (the Vault was AC Comics&#x27; method of reviving a number of public domain superheroes from now-defunct publishing companies of the Golden Age of Comic Books).

==Team members==
The lineup of Femforce has frequently changed over the decades of the team&#x27;s existence but has included the following characters:

* Miss Victory: Real Name: Joan Wayne. Powers: Superhuman strength, flight and invulnerability. Based on the original Golden Age Miss Victory. Team leader.
* She Cat: Real name: Jessica Hunt. Powers: Enhanced strength with advanced agility and reflexes. Based on the Harvey Comics version of Black Cat.
* Nightveil: Real Name: Laura Wright. Powers: Sorcery, flight, dimensional travel. Originally a gun-toting heroine named Blue Bulleteer. The Blue Bulleteer identity is based on the Fox Feature Syndicate version of Phantom Lady (not to be confused with the Quality Comics/DC Comics character of the same name).
* Rio Rita: Real Name: Rita Farrar. A spy from Spain, she retired and was eventually succeeded by her granddaughter. She had no powers. Based on Fiction House&#x27;s Senorita Rio.
* Synn: Real name: Silva Synn. Powers: Illusions, flight, matter manipulation.
* Tara: Real name: Tara Fremont. Powers: Size changing, ability to communicate with animals. Inspired by Sheena, Queen of the Jungle and other jungle girl characters of the 1940s and 1950s. 
* Rayda: Real name: Dyna Morisi. Powers: Electricity manipulation, enhanced reflexes.
* Stardust: Real name: Dr. Mara. Powers: Flight, superhuman strength, energy bolts.
* Colt: Real name: Valencia Kirk. Powers: None, though she is an expert in espionage, weapons technology. Temporarily took over as team leader after the original Miss Victory became the villainess Rad; was later replaced as team leader when Joan Wayne&#x27;s daughter, Jennifer, became the new Ms. Victory.
* Firebeam: The ghost of a woman killed in a house fire, whose spirit can now control fire.
* Ms. Victory: Real name: Jennifer (Wayne) Burke. Daughter of the original Miss Victory, Joan Wayne. Later became the anti-heroine Rad. Powers: Superhuman strength, flight and invulnerability.
* Dragonfly: Real name: Nancy Arazello. Powers: Superhuman strength, telekinesis and flight.
* Thunderfox: A fictional comic book character brought to life by Nightveil&#x27;s magic. Later fades from existence when her comic is cancelled. Powers: Superhuman strength and invulnerability.

==Other characters==
* Garganta: Real name: Carol Heisler. Powers: Size-changing and telepathy. Originally an elderly scientist turned into a young blonde, later made an auxiliary Femforce member. Writers Dominique Mainon and James Ursini described Garganta as a modern example of the giantess rooted in the myth of the Amazons. A live-action film featuring Garganta was produced by Bill Black. 
* Yankee Girl: Real name: Lauren Mason. Powers: Flight, superhuman strength, invulnerability. Based on the original Golden Age Yankee Girl.
* Fem Paragon: A fascist tyrant from another dimension and leader of the armies of Rur.

<doc id="331975" wikidata="Q333480" url="?curid=331975" title="Oliver Letwin">
<text>Sir Oliver Letwin (born 19 May 1956) is a British politician, Member of Parliament (MP) for West Dorset from 1997 to 2019. Letwin was elected as a member of the Conservative Party, but sat as an independent after having the whip removed in September 2019. He was Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer under Michael Howard and Shadow Home Secretary under Iain Duncan Smith. He was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 2014 to 2016.

Following the 2015 general election Letwin was given overall responsibility for the Cabinet Office and became a full member of the Cabinet in the Conservative government. Previously he had been the Minister of State for Government Policy from 2010.

During the Second May ministry in 2019, Letwin rebelled against leading Eurosceptics within the Conservative Party by tabling a cross-party motion to hold &quot;indicative votes&quot;, allowing MPs to vote on several Brexit options in order to establish whether any could command a majority in the House of Commons; it transpired that none of them could. Letwin sought to extend Article 50 through passing the Cooper–Letwin Act. In August 2019 he announced that he would stand down at the next election. On 3 September 2019, he lost the Conservative party whip and sat as an independent MP after that.

==Early life and education==
Letwin, who was born 19 May 1956 in London, is the son of William Letwin (14 December 1922 – 20 February 2013), emeritus professor at the London School of Economics, and the conservative academic Shirley Robin Letwin. His parents were &quot;Jewish-American intellectuals from Chicago whose parents had fled persecution in Kiev.&quot;

He was educated at The Hall School, Hampstead and at Eton College. He then went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he received a double first in history. From 1980 to 1981, Letwin was a visiting fellow (a Procter Fellow) of Princeton University, then a research fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge, from 1981 until 1982. His thesis, &quot;Emotion and Emotions&quot;, earned a PhD awarded by the Cambridge Philosophy Faculty in 1982. He is also a graduate of the London Business School.

==Political career==
He was a member of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Policy Unit from 1983 to 1986.

According to official government documents from 1985, released in December 2014 under the thirty-year rule, Letwin recommended that the Prime Minister &quot;use Scotland as a trail-blazer for the pure residence charge&quot;, i.e. the controversial Community Charge or &quot;Poll tax&quot;, having trialled it there first, and to implement it nationwide should &quot;the exemplifications prove ... it is feasible.&quot;

Another 1985 internal memo released in December 2015 showed Letwin&#x27;s response to the Broadwater Farm riot, which blamed the violence on the &quot;bad moral attitudes&quot; of the predominantly Afro-Caribbean rioters, claiming that &quot;lower-class, unemployed white people lived for years without a breakdown of public order on anything like the present scale&quot;. It also criticised some of the schemes proposed to address inner-city problems, suggesting David Young&#x27;s proposed scheme to support black entrepreneurs would flounder because the money would be spent on the &quot;disco and drug trade&quot;. Letwin later apologised, saying that parts of the memo had been &quot;both badly worded and wrong.&quot;

Letwin co-authored &quot;Britain&#x27;s biggest enterprise: ideas for radical reform of the NHS&quot;, a 1988 Centre for Policy Studies pamphlet written with John Redwood which advocated a closer relationship between the National Health Service and the private sector. This is regarded as providing a theoretical justification for NHS reforms carried out by subsequent governments, particularly the Health and Social Care Act 2012.

Letwin stood unsuccessfully against Diane Abbott in Hackney North and Stoke Newington at the 1987 election, and against Glenda Jackson for the Hampstead and Highgate seat at the 1992 election.

===MP for West Dorset (1997–2019)===
Letwin won the historically safe Conservative seat of West Dorset at the 1997 general election, achieving a majority of 1,840 votes over the next candidate.

====Shadow Cabinet (2000–2010)====

As Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Conservative Party William Hague appointed Letwin as a member of his Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury in September 2000. He supported Michael Portillo and Michael Howard in their consecutive tenures as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer.

He had previously been an official Opposition spokesman on Constitutional Affairs, Scotland and Wales from 1998, and was promoted to Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury in 1999.

During the campaign for the 2001 general election, Letwin expressed an aspiration to curtail future public spending by £20 billion per annum relative to the plans of the Labour government. When this proposal came under attack as regressive, Letwin found few of his colleagues to defend it, and he adopted a low profile for the remainder of the campaign. He went into hiding during the 2001 election. At this election, his majority in his West Dorset constituency was cut to 1,414 votes.

In September 2001, he was appointed Shadow Home Secretary by the new Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith. In this role, he attracted plaudits for his advocacy of a &quot;neighbourly society&quot;, which manifested itself in calls for street by street neighbourhood policing, modelled on the philosophy of the police in New York. He was also largely credited with forcing the then Home Secretary to withdraw his proposal in 2001 to introduce an offence of incitement to religious hatred. He successfully argued that such an offence would be impossible to define, so there would be little chance of prosecution. He also argued that Muslims would feel persecuted by such a law. In late 2003, Michael Howard appointed Letwin as his successor as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. As Shadow Chancellor he focused on reducing waste in the public sector.

At the 2005 general election the Conservative Party claimed to have found £35 billion worth of potential savings, to be used for increased resources for front-line services and for tax cuts. This approach was credited with forcing the government to introduce bureaucracy reduction and cost-cutting proposals of their own. In May 2005, Letwin&#x27;s majority in his seat increased to 2,461 votes, despite his hard pro-EU views. After the election, Letwin was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that he had requested a role less onerous than his former Treasury brief so that he would have time to pursue his career in the City. Until December 2009, he was a non-executive director of the merchant bank NM Rothschild Corporate Finance Ltd.

Following Michael Howard&#x27;s decision to stand down as Conservative Party leader after the 2005 election, Letwin publicly backed the youngest candidate and eventual winner David Cameron.

In the lead-up to the 2010 general election, Letwin played an important role in the development of Conservative policy, and was described by Daniel Finkelstein as &quot;the Gandalf of the process&quot;. The 2010 general election saw him increase his majority to 3,923 votes.

====Cameron premiership (2010–2016)====
British Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Letwin to the newly created office of Minister of State for Government Policy in the newly formed Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition government in May 2010. His responsibilities included developing government policies with the Cabinet Office, as set out in the Coalition&#x27;s programme for government, as well as implementing departmental business plans. He also attended the Cabinet, although not as a full member or Cabinet Minister.

Letwin was appointed as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 14 July 2014, succeeding Lord Hill of Oareford who became the United Kingdom&#x27;s next European Commissioner. He also continued in his role as Minister for Policy until the 2015 general election, when the position was abolished.

He was returned with a much increased majority of 16,130 votes by his West Dorset constituents at the 2015 general election. Following that election, Letwin remained Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Cameron also appointed him as a full member of the new Conservative government&#x27;s Cabinet with responsibility for overall charge and oversight of the Cabinet Office.

Immediately after the 23 June 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Cameron appointed Letwin &quot;Minister for Brexit&quot;. He appeared on 5 July before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee and was criticised for Government&#x27;s lack of planning for a leave vote. The Cabinet was accused of &quot;dereliction of duty&quot;. When committee chairman Crispin Blunt observed, upon the resignation of Cameron, that Letwin had been left &quot;holding the baby&quot;, Letwin said,
&quot;I can only say that the baby is being firmly held, and that my intention is that the baby should prosper – because I care about the baby in question. It is, in fact, our country.&quot;

Letwin was awarded a knighthood by David Cameron in the 2016 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours List. This gave him the honorific title &quot;Sir&quot; for life.

====May premiership (2016–2019)====
The new Prime Minister Theresa May terminated Letwin&#x27;s tenure as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and split the Minister for Brexit position he had held, creating the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union and handing that job to arch-Leaver David Davis.

In 2018, Letwin led an &quot;independent review&quot; into the delivery of housing on large development sites.

During the Second May ministry in 2019, Letwin rebelled against leading Eurosceptics within the Conservative Party by tabling a cross-party motion to hold &quot;indicative votes&quot;, allowing MPs to vote on several Brexit options in order to establish whether any could command a majority in the House of Commons. Though no option received a positive number of votes, the &quot;People&#x27;s Vote&quot; proposal from Margaret Beckett was the most popular.

====Expulsion from the Conservative Party====

In August 2019, Letwin announced that he would stand down at the next general election. On 3 September 2019 he proposed the Letwin motion upon the Benn bill under Standing Order No. 24, and then, with 20 other rebel Conservative MPs, voted against the Conservative government of Boris Johnson. The rebel MPs voted for the Letwin motion to take control of parliamentary business from the government, for the purpose of introducing a bill which would prevent the Prime Minister&#x27;s policy of allowing the United Kingdom to leave the EU without a deal on 31 October. The bill thus introduced the next day became the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019. Subsequently, all 21 were advised that they had lost the Conservative whip, expelling them as Conservative MPs and requiring them to sit as independents. If Letwin had decided to stand for re-election in a future election the party would have blocked him as a Conservative candidate, but that was immaterial for him, as he had already promised in August to stand down.

====As an independent MP====
After his summary ejection from the Conservative parliamentary party, Letwin sat as an independent. On 19 October 2019, he tabled an amendment to the Government business of the &#x27;super Saturday&#x27; session. His amendment passed by 322 to 306 votes. The government then deferred the vote it had planned for that day on the actual deal itself. His amendment attracted the support of ten former Conservative and ten Democratic Unionist Party members, while the government attracted the votes of six Labour MPs and seventeen independents. Eight Labour MPs, five Conservatives and one independent member did not vote on the Letwin motion. The following day, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; published a declaration from an anonymous Conservative source that Letwin&#x27;s motion had been masterminded by Lord Pannick, the barrister who had represented Gina Miller in her actions against the Johnson ministry&#x27;s Brexit policy.

After announcing that he would not stand in the 2019 general election, Letwin was succeeded as the Conservative candidate for Dorset West by Chris Loder, who was subsequently elected as the seat&#x27;s MP.

==Public sector spending==
Letwin maintained in June 2017 that the public is willing to increase taxes carefully for large numbers of people to pay for improved public services. Letwin said, &quot;It may well be, in one way or another, a large number of people will have to pay a little more tax if we are going to maintain the trend towards reduced deficits and yet spend a little more on the crucial public services that do need more spent on them&quot;. Letwin wants to see better public services rather than higher public sector pay. Letwin believes reducing the deficit is important so Britain is protected when the next downturn comes.

==Controversies==

===1985 Broadwater Farm memo controversy===
In 1985, Letwin and Hartley Booth wrote a five-page document as members of then-Prime Minister Thatcher&#x27;s policy unit in response to the widespread 1985 unrest in Britain&#x27;s inner cities – with riots in Broadwater Farm estates in Tottenham, North London, Handsworth, Brixton, Peckham and Toxteth. In the paper, Letwin and Booth urged &quot;Thatcher to ignore reports that rioting in mainly black urban areas was the result of social deprivation and racism.&quot; Letwin was at the time considered to be a &quot;young star&quot; of the Conservative Party. The memo scorned suggestions by senior cabinet ministers to set up a £10 million communities programme to tackle inner-city problems by helping black entrepreneurs start businesses as suggested by then-Employment Secretary David Young, refurbishing public housing council blocks as suggested by then-Environment Secretary Kenneth Baker and &quot;establishing training programmes for low-income youth.&quot;

Letwin said it would not ameliorate the situation but would do little more than &quot;subsidise Rastafarian arts and crafts workshops&quot; stating that black &quot;entrepreneurs will set up in the disco and drug trade.&quot; When the 1985 paper was released to public record by the Cabinet Office along with other Whitehall papers under accelerated procedures of the 30 years rule into the public record through the National Archives in Kew, West London on 30 December 2015, a chastened Letwin apologised on the same day for &quot;the offence caused&quot;.

Trevor Phillips OBE, former head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission observed that, &quot;I don&#x27;t think these remarks would have raised a single eyebrow at the time.&quot;

The 1985 Broadwater Farm memo argued the riots were caused by bad behaviour not social conditions. The policy unit proposed a programme for creating &quot;better attitudes,&quot; including measures to encourage the establishment of &#x27;old-fashioned independent schools&#x27; which Cabinet Secretary Sir Robert Armstrong warned in 1985 constituted social engineering.

Labour MP Chuka Umunna, whose Streatham constituency included parts of Brixton, said the tone of the memo was &quot;positively Victorian.&quot; He added:

The attitudes towards the black community exhibited in the paper are disgusting and appalling ... The authors of this paper illustrate a complete ignorance of what was going on in our community at that time, as evidenced by their total and utter disregard of the rampant racism in the Met Police which caused the community to boil over – there is no mention of that racism in their paper. 
In July 2014 the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot; for the shooting and the time it had taken to say sorry&quot; following an inquest into the death of Dorothy &quot;Cherry&quot; Groce, whose shooting by the Metropolitan Police triggered the riots. The jury inquest blamed the Metropolitan Police for failures that contributed to Groce&#x27;s death.

===Asylum seekers===
In 2003, while Shadow Home Secretary, Letwin announced a policy to prevent any asylum seekers entering the UK instead suggesting a &quot;far off-shore processing centre&quot;. When questioned about where this processing centre would be, he said &quot;I haven&#x27;t the slightest idea yet&quot;. He had previously suggested holding asylum seekers on prison ships for vetting by security services.

===NHS privatisation===
In June 2004, Letwin, then Shadow Chancellor, was reported by an attendee to have stated at a private meeting that within five years from a Conservative election victory &quot;the NHS [would] not exist anymore&quot;, to be replaced by a &quot;funding stream handing out money to pay people where they want to go for their healthcare&quot;. The incident occurred after he had urged local business lobbying efforts to create a PFI hospital in Dorchester in May, and dismissed revealing the extent of his planned cuts to public spending to the voters as &quot;irrational&quot;. Letwin denied the comments after they were exploited by Labour. A Conservative spokesman asserted Letwin&#x27;s intended meaning to have been that &quot;within five years a Conservative government would have broken down the monolithic bureaucracy of the health service, putting decision-making in the hands of the hospitals rather than the Whitehall pen-pushers&quot;, with &quot;a far more efficient and effective NHS&quot; as the end result.

===Expenses===
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported in 2009 that Letwin agreed to repay a bill for £2,145 for replacing a leaking pipe under the tennis court at his constituency home in Dorset, which he had claimed on his parliamentary expenses.

===Public sector reform===
Speaking to consultancy firm KPMG on 27 July 2011, Letwin caused controversy after stating that you cannot have &quot;innovation and excellence&quot; without &quot;real discipline and some fear on the part of the providers&quot; in the public sector. This was widely reported, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; headline stating Letwin says &quot;public sector workers need &#x27;discipline and fear&#x27;.&quot;

===Government document disposal===
In October 2011 the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported a story that Letwin had thrown away more than 100 secret government documents in public bins in St. James&#x27;s Park, with no real care to dispose of them properly. Enquiries made by the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office found that although Letwin did not dispose of any government documents, he had in fact disposed of constituents&#x27; personal and confidential letters to him and therefore did breach data protection rules. Letwin later apologised for his actions.

==Personal life==
Letwin married government lawyer Isabel Davidson in 1984; the couple have two children.

In 2003, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported Letwin saying that he would &quot;go out on the streets and beg&quot; rather than send his children to the state schools in Lambeth where he and his family lived.

==Honours==
* He was sworn of Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council in 2002. This gave him the honorific style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.
* He was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II after being recommended by David Cameron in the 2016 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours. This gave him the honorific title &quot;Sir&quot; for life.
* He has been elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. This gave him the post-nominal letters &quot;FRSA&quot; for life.

<text>A keyboard buffer is a section of computer memory used to hold keystrokes before they are processed.

Keyboard buffers have long been used in command-line processing. As a user enters a command, they see it echoed on their terminal and can edit it before it is processed by the computer.

In time-sharing systems, the location of the buffer depends on whether communications is full-duplex or half-duplex. In full-duplex systems, keystrokes are transmitted one by one. As the main computer receives each keystroke, it ordinarily appends the character which it represents to the end of the keyboard buffer. The exception is control characters, such as &quot;delete&quot; or &quot;backspace&quot; which correct typing mistakes by deleting the character at the end of the buffer.

In half-duplex systems, keystrokes are echoed locally on a computer terminal. The user can see the command line on their terminal and edit it before it is transmitted to the main computer. Thus the buffer is local.

On some early home computers, to minimize the necessary hardware, a CPU interrupt checked the keyboard&#x27;s switches for key presses multiple times each second, and recorded the key presses in a keyboard buffer for the operating system or application software to read.

On some systems, if the user presses too many keys at once, the keyboard buffer overflows and will emit a beep from the computer&#x27;s internal speaker.

== Other uses ==

The use of keyboard buffers is sometimes known from the user experience side as typeahead.

<doc id="331986" wikidata="Q62882" url="?curid=331986" title="Marc Andreessen">
<text>Marc Lowell Andreessen (/ænˈdriːsən/ AN-dree-sen; born July 9, 1971) is an American businessman and former software engineer. He is the co-author of Mosaic, the first widely used web browser with a graphical user interface; co-founder of Netscape; and co-founder and general partner of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. He co-founded and later sold the software company Opsware to Hewlett-Packard; he also co-founded Ning, a company that provides a platform for social networking websites. He is an inductee in the World Wide Web Hall of Fame. Andreessen&#x27;s net worth is estimated at $1.9 billion as of January 2025.

== Early life and education ==
Andreessen was born in Cedar Falls, Iowa, and raised in New Lisbon, Wisconsin. He is the son of Patricia and Lowell Andreessen, who worked for a seed company. In December 1993, he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UIUC). As an undergraduate, he interned twice at IBM in Austin, Texas. He worked in the AIX graphics software development group responsible for the MIT X Window implementation and ports of the 3D language APIs: SGI&#x27;s Graphics Language (GL) and PHIGS. He also worked at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois, where he became familiar with Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s open standards for the World Wide Web. After being shown the ViolaWWW graphic web browser in late 1992, Andreessen and full-time salaried co-worker Eric Bina worked on creating a browser with integrated graphics that could be ported to a wide range of computers, including Windows. The result was the Mosaic web browser released in 1993.

==Career==

Andreessen has worked at Netscape, Opsware, founded Andreessen Horowitz, and invested in many successful companies including Facebook, Foursquare, GitHub, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Twitter.

=== Netscape ===
After graduating from UIUC in 1993, Andreessen moved to California to work at Enterprise Integration Technologies. Andreessen then met with Jim Clark, the founder of Silicon Graphics, who had recently exited the firm. Clark believed the Mosaic browser had great commercial possibilities and suggested starting an Internet software company. Soon, Mosaic Communications Corporation was in business in Mountain View, California, with Andreessen as co-founder and vice president of technology. The University of Illinois was unhappy with the company&#x27;s use of the Mosaic name, so Mosaic Communications changed its name to Netscape Communications, and its flagship Web browser was the Netscape Navigator.

Netscape&#x27;s IPO in 1995 put Andreessen in the public eye. He was on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; and other publications.

Netscape was acquired in 1999 for $4.3 billion by AOL. Andreessen&#x27;s hiring as its chief technical officer was contingent on the completion of the acquisition. The same year, he was named to the &quot;MIT Technology Review&quot; TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.

=== Opsware ===
After AOL acquired Netscape in late 1998, Andreessen founded Opsware with Ben Horowitz, Tim Howes, and In Sik Rhee. Originally named Loudcloud, the company provided computing, hosting and software services to consumer-facing internet and e-commerce companies. Loudcloud sold its hosting business to EDS and changed its name to Opsware in 2003, with Andreessen serving as chairman. Acquired by Hewlett-Packard for $1.6 billion in 2007, it was one of the first companies to offer software as a service and to attempt cloud hosting.

===Andreessen Horowitz===
Between 2005 and 2009, Andreessen and Horowitz separately invested a total of $80 million in 45 startups, including Twitter and Qik. The two became well known as super angel investors. On July 6, 2009, Andreessen and Horowitz announced their Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

=== Investments ===
Andreessen Horowitz began with an initial capitalization of $300 million; within three years the firm grew to $2.7 billion under management across three funds. In 2012, Andreessen Horowitz&#x27;s portfolio holdings included Facebook, Foursquare, GitHub, Pinterest, Twitter, and Honor, Inc.

On September 1, 2009, an investor group that included Andreessen Horowitz acquired a majority stake in Skype at a valuation of $2.75 billion, which was considered risky. The deal paid off in May 2011 when Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion. In 2010, the firm assisted Silicon Valley attorney Ted Wang in creating the first free standardized seed round financing documents, the Series Seed Documents.

Andreessen joined the eBay board of directors in 2008 and served on it for six years. In October 2014, he announced his resignation from the board due to the company&#x27;s decision to break off its online payments unit PayPal. The decision to cut ties with PayPal was a point of contention between Andreessen and investor Carl Icahn. Icahn advocated for the PayPal split while Andreessen opposed the spin-off, resulting in public disputes. Andreessen was accused by Icahn of putting his own interests in front of what was best for shareholders. Icahn published his argument in an open letter that detailed alleged conflicts of interest in eBay&#x27;s 2009 sale of Skype to a group of private investors, which included Andreessen&#x27;s firm.

===Industry influence===
Andreessen advises the leaders of companies in which Andreessen Horowitz invests, including Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Mark Pincus of Zynga.

Andreessen and Horowitz were ranked No. 6 on &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;″s 2011 New Establishment List, no. 1 on CNET&#x27;s 2011 most influential investors list and Nos. 2 and 21, respectively, on the 2012 &quot;Forbes&quot; Midas List of Tech&#x27;s Top Investors.

In April 2012, Andreessen and Andreessen Horowitz General Partners Ben Horowitz, Peter Levine, Jeff Jordan, John O&#x27;Farrell, and Scott Weiss pledged to donate half their lifetime incomes from venture capital to charitable organizations.

In 2012, Andreessen was named in the &quot;Time&quot; 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world assembled by &quot;Time&quot;. His essay &quot;Software is eating the world&quot; has been influential and widely cited.

In 2013, Andreessen was one of five Internet and Web pioneers awarded the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering.

In April 2020, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Andreessen published an opinion article, &quot;It&#x27;s time to build&quot;, describing the United States&#x27; COVID-19 response and suggesting technological and cultural solutions to the problem.

In October 2023, Andreessen published a &quot;Techno-Optimist Manifesto&quot; arguing that civilization is built on technology and that &quot;Technology is the glory of human ambition and achievement, the spearhead of progress, and the realization of our potential.&quot; He has also described himself as a &quot;tescrealist&quot;.

=== Ventures ===
Andreessen cofounded and chaired Ning, the third company he established, after Netscape and Loudcloud. In September 2011, it was announced that Ning had been sold to Mode Media for a reported price of $150 million. Andreessen joined Glam Media&#x27;s board of directors after the sale.

He is a personal investor in companies including LinkedIn and boutique bank Raine.

Andreessen serves on the board of Meta, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Kno, Stanford Hospital, Bump Technologies, Anki, Oculus VR, OpenGov, Dialpad, and TinyCo. Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced in February 2018 that board member Andreessen would not seek reelection at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on April 4. In his time at Hewlett Packard, Andreessen had been partially blamed for some of the company&#x27;s failures, including the recruiting of Léo Apotheker as well as the acquisitions of Autonomy and Palm.

He is advisor to Asana and director of CollabNet. He is a proponent of Bitcoin. Andreessen is on an advisory board for Neom, the Saudi Arabian government&#x27;s plan to build a futuristic megacity in the desert.

=== Criticism ===
In February 2016, Andreessen posted a tweet in response to India&#x27;s decision to apply net neutrality to Facebook&#x27;s proposed project Free Basics. The tweet suggested that anti-colonialism had been catastrophic for the Indian people. Andreessen later deleted the tweet following criticism from Indians and non-Indians alike (including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg). Facebook spent millions advertising Free Basics to the Indian public. The project failed due to violations, setting preferential tariffs in accessing content and setting up a &quot;walled garden&quot; on the internet.

==== Conflict of interest ====
In April 2016, Facebook shareholders filed a class action lawsuit to block Zuckerberg&#x27;s plan to create a new class of non-voting shares. The lawsuit alleges Andreessen secretly coached Zuckerberg through a process to win board approval for the stock change, while Andreessen served as an independent board member representing stockholders.

According to court documents, Andreessen shared information with Zuckerberg about their progress and concerns and helped Zuckerberg negotiate against shareholders. Court documents included transcripts of private texts between Zuckerberg and Andreessen.

== Personal life ==

Andreessen married Laura Arrillaga in 2006. She is the founder of the Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund and daughter of Silicon Valley real estate billionaire John Arrillaga. They have one son together.

In 2009, Andreessen issued a $25,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in the 1987 unsolved murder of Barbara Blackstone, a teacher from New Lisbon High School in Wisconsin, where he had attended. The case remains unsolved as of 2022.

In 2021, he and his wife bought a property in Malibu for $177 million from Serge and Florence Azria. This was the highest price paid for a California property at that time. As of February 2023, his net worth is estimated at $1.7 billion by &quot;Forbes&quot;.

In 2022, Andreessen advocated against the construction of 131 multifamily housing units in their affluent Atherton, California town. In a letter, Andreessen and his wife wrote that they opposed permitting more than one house on a single acre of land. Andreessen&#x27;s comments sparked criticisms of hypocrisy, as he had previously argued for increased housing supply, in particular in California.

===Politics===
Andreessen endorsed and voted for Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. In 2012, Andreessen donated $100,000 to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. During the 2016 primary season, he endorsed Republican candidate Carly Fiorina, but after Fiorina dropped out of the race, Andreessen switched his endorsement to the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, citing the Republican nominee Donald Trump&#x27;s immigration stance.

In July 2024, Andreessen announced he would donate to Super PACs that support Donald Trump&#x27;s 2024 presidential campaign.

Andreessen is a mega-donor to the political superPAC and pro-cryptocurrency advocacy group Fairshake. Andreessen came out against president Joe Biden&#x27;s re-election bid, saying he feared higher taxes on billionaires and stricter regulations on industries he invests in (cryptocurrency and AI). On Joe Rogan&#x27;s podcast in November 2024, Andreessen claimed that some cryptocurrency users have been unfairly debanked.

== Accolades ==
Andreessen was one of six inductees in the World Wide Web Hall of Fame announced at the First International Conference on the World-Wide Web in 1994.

<text>The Communist Party of Great Britain is a political group which publishes the &quot;Weekly Worker&quot; newspaper. The CPGB (PCC) claims to have &quot;an internationalist duty to uphold the principle, &#x27;One state, one party&#x27;. To the extent that the European Union becomes a state then that necessitates EU-wide trade unions and a Communist Party of the EU&quot;. In addition, it is in favour of the unification of the entire working class under a new Communist International. It is not to be confused with the former Communist Party of Great Britain, the Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist–Leninist), or the current Communist Party of Britain.

== Formation ==

The origins of the CPGB (PCC) lie in the New Communist Party of Britain (NCP) which split from the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1977. Under the influence of a faction of the Communist Party of Turkey, a handful led by NCP youth section leader John Chamberlain (who uses the pseudonym Jack Conrad) attempted to rejoin the then CPGB.

Few actually regained party cards but the grouping began to publish &quot;The Leninist&quot;, first as a journal, then as a more or less monthly paper. Initially &quot;The Leninist&quot; appeared to some to be a Stalinist publication in its politics, but over time it mutated into something very different. This may be due to their interaction with various Trotskyist groups including a series of exchanges with the Spartacist League. The faction developed a critique of the Stalinist states as well as the bureaucratism and political liquidationism of the old CPGB.

== Post-CPGB dissolution ==
After the dissolution of the official CPGB in 1991 and its relaunch as the Democratic Left, the group declared their intention to reforge the party on what they declared to be &quot;firm Leninist principles&quot;. They organised an &quot;emergency conference&quot;, at which they claimed the CPGB name, but not its assets. They also changed the name of their paper, increasing its regularity to weekly.

By the early 1990s the group was working closely with the tiny Trotskyist Revolutionary Democratic Group and the discussion magazine &quot;Open Polemic&quot;. It also sought to deepen its links with a group of recent ex-members of other Trotskyist groups such as the Socialist Workers Party who called themselves the International Socialist Group. The CPGB (PCC) described this process as &quot;Communist rapprochement&quot;. The attempt failed as the ISG collapsed and &quot;Open Polemic&quot; briefly enrolled a few of its supporters in the CPGB (PCC), only for them to quit in a row over money.

During the 1992 general election campaign, Ken Livingstone claimed that the members of the CPGB (PCC) were &quot;MI5 agents&quot;.

In 1999, the group stood candidates for two UK constituencies in the European elections. Prevented from using the CPGB name it stood as &#x27;Weekly Worker&#x27;.

== Activities ==
The group was for a short while embedded in the Socialist Labour Party, but left to join the Socialist Alliance in which they came to work closely with the Alliance for Workers&#x27; Liberty and proposed a merger of their papers, rejected by the AWL. The two have since politically drifted apart.

In 2004, the group affiliated to the Respect Coalition. A minority disagreed with the tactic of working within Respect and formed a faction called the Red Platform. The new faction called instead for the CPGB (PCC) to rejoin a Socialist Alliance reform current called the Socialist Alliance Democracy Platform. The Red Platform won their aim but the CPGB (PCC) majority continued to work within Respect. Members of the Red Platform subsequently left to create the Red Party in August 2004 over a disagreement about their views being published in the paper.

The group was active in the Campaign for a Marxist Party (2006–2008) and is critical of the Campaign for a New Workers&#x27; Party and the Convention of the Left. The CPGB (PCC) was heavily involved in founding the Hands Off the People of Iran (HOPI) campaign. Mark Fischer, formerly National Organiser of the CPGB (PCC), is HOPI secretary. The CPGB (PCC) also enjoys close links with Communist Students.

The CPGB (PCC) endorsed the Labour Party in the June 2009 European Parliament elections and criticised the No to EU – Yes to Democracy coalition as &quot;left-wing nationalist&quot;.

Non-members such as former Soviet dissident Boris Kagarlitsky, Matzpen founder Moshé Machover and Professor Hillel Ticktin, editor of &quot;Critique&quot; and chairman of the &quot;Centre for the Study of Socialist Theory and Movements&quot;, University of Glasgow, have spoken at CPGB (PCC) events.

=== Campaign for a Marxist Party ===
The Campaign for a Marxist Party was a campaign (founded 4 November 2006) run by the CPGB-PCC and other organisations on the British left for a political party with explicitly Marxist goals as part of a rebuilt workers&#x27; international. Its members were &quot;Critique&quot; (who proposed the campaign initially), CPGB (PCC) and the Democratic Socialist Alliance. The Irish Socialist Democracy group welcomed the CPGB (PCC). Similar socialist campaign groups include Campaign for a New Workers&#x27; Party and Convention of the Left.

The campaign agreed three founding political principles at the founding conference:
# We are in favour of a planned, democratic socialist society and against the market.
# Socialism will be achieved in a single step when the working class seizes power over society, there are no intermediate &quot;democratic&quot; or other stages
# The Campaign is against the destructive incubus of Stalinism and will seek to make clear the counter revolutionary and anti-human nature of the Stalinist regimes and Parties. Stalinism was responsible for mass slaughter, brutal incarceration and the atomisation of the people of the countries under its control. In addition the Stalinists were responsible for the most cynical and costly betrayals of the working class everywhere from Germany to South Africa – no Party which has as its aim the liberation of humanity can do other than condemn the Stalinist current and seek to undo the damage done to Marxism by it.

Its seven-member executive mainly consisted of members of the CPGB (PCC) and the &quot;Democratic Socialist Alliance&quot; criticised the party for its &quot;hijacking&quot; of the campaign. A group of members became known as the Trotskyist Tendency. The campaign published &quot;Marxist Voice&quot;.

In November 2008, it was announced that the CPGB (PCC) would move to wind up the campaign at its December AGM. Having done so, it claimed it will establish a new committee to promote &quot;unity of Marxists as Marxists&quot;. A minority of members objected to the dissolution of the campaign including in published articles by Dave Spencer, Phil Sharpe and Steve Freeman.

=== Communist Platform of Left Unity ===
In 2013, the CPGB (PCC) intervened in the campaign for a new left party initiated by film director Ken Loach. They accused the campaign&#x27;s initial appeal of making &quot;Keynesian platitudes&quot; and called for a new formation on the left to have an explicitly Marxist programme. The CPGB (PCC) described the &quot;politically decrepit&quot; Socialist Resistance as &quot;the one &#x27;insider&#x27; group&quot; in the campaign and accused the group of attempting &quot;to relive old Labour-style Keynesian welfarism&quot;.

In the run up to the Left Unity (LU) founding conference in November 2013, the CPGB (PCC) launched the Communist Platform in response to the Socialist Platform &quot;[obscuring] the differences between Marxism and a left reading of clause four-type politics&quot;. They launched the Communist Platform as a permanent tendency in Left Unity on 8 February 2014. On 29 March 2014, CPGB member Yassamine Mather was elected to Left Unity&#x27;s National Council at the party&#x27;s first policy conference.

In February 2016, the CPGB (PCC) dissolved their Platform and left LU.

=== Labour Party ===
In 2015, the CPGB (PCC) supported Jeremy Corbyn in his successful campaign to be elected leader of the Labour Party. The CPGB (PCC) has been a supporter of Labour Party Marxists (LPM), which promotes many of the ideas of the &quot;Weekly Worker&quot; to a Labour Party audience through its website and occasional print bulletins. Stan Keable, secretary of Labour Party Marxists, was expelled from the Labour Party in June 2017 for his association with LPM. The CPGB (PCC) has also promoted the work of another Labour Party organisation, Labour against the witch-hunt, in the &quot;Weekly Worker&quot;. In 2020, the CPGB (PCC) suffered the resignation of a number of members around its work in the Labour Left Alliance. The leadership of the CPGB (PCC) have argued that this was due to a departure from communist principle on the part of those members; this has been strongly rejected by the leadership&#x27;s internal critics.

=== Communist University ===
Every year the CPGB (PCC) organises a weeklong summer school called Communist University. They invite speakers from in- and outside the CPGB (PCC) to discuss a range of topics. Amongst the regular speakers are Scottish computer scientist Paul Cockshott, Iranian scholar and activist Yassamine Mather and a founder of the Israeli socialist organisation Matzpen, Moshé Machover. Recurring themes, amongst others, are international politics, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Labour Party.

== Policies ==
The party has been involved in a rethinking of the class nature of the former Soviet Union. Despite its origins in the New Communist Party of Britain, &quot;The Leninist&quot; advanced sharp criticisms of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc countries while strongly opposing movements it considered to be in support of capitalism. Today, leading member Jack Conrad calls these societies forms of &quot;bureaucratic socialism&quot; in a view strongly influenced by Hillel Ticktin and the &quot;Critique&quot; journal while Mike Macnair argues that the Soviet Union was a peasant based society frozen in transition from feudalism to capitalism. However, the CPGB (PCC) does not formally endorse any particular theoretical analysis of the Soviet Union.

During the Kosovo War of the late 1990s, the party supported the ethnic-Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and supports the complete secession of Kosovo from Serbia. The party refers to Kosovo as Kosova, the Albanian and Ottoman Turkish name for Kosovo.

The party formerly listed the abolition of the age of consent among its immediate demands, with alternative legislation to protect children from sexual abuse. In 2021 it amended this demand: &quot;Young people are entitled to develop their sexual lives free from parental, police or religious control. We favour legislation which protects children and young people from sexual exploitation by those who are substantially older than them, especially by those in authority over them.&quot;

== International ==
The CPGB (PCC) has informal ties with the Dutch Communist Platform, which shares a similar political point of view. Members of the Communist Platform have visited the CPGB&#x27;s Communist University in the past.

<doc id="332008" wikidata="Q622901" url="?curid=332008" title="Korsakoff syndrome">
<text>Korsakoff syndrome (KS) is a disorder of the central nervous system characterized by amnesia, deficits in explicit memory, and confabulation. This neurological disorder is caused by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1) in the brain, and it is typically associated with and exacerbated by the prolonged, excessive ingestion of alcohol. Korsakoff syndrome is often accompanied by Wernicke encephalopathy; this combination is called Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome.

Korsakoff syndrome is named after Sergei Korsakoff, the Russian neuropsychiatrist who described it during the late 19th century.

==Signs and symptoms==
There are seven major symptoms of Korsakoff syndrome, an amnestic-confabulatory syndrome:
* anterograde amnesia, memory loss for events after the onset of the syndrome
* retrograde amnesia, memory loss extends back for some time before the onset of the syndrome
* amnesia of fixation, also known as fixation amnesia (loss of immediate memory, a person being unable to remember events of the past few minutes)
* confabulation, that is, invented memories which are then taken as true, due to gaps in memory, with such gaps sometimes associated with blackouts
* minimal content in conversation
* lack of insight
* apathy – interest in things is quickly lost, and there is an indifference to change

Benon R. and LeHuché R. (1920) described the characteristic signs of Korsakoff syndrome with some additional features including: confabulation (false memories), fixation amnesia, paragnosia or false recognition of places, mental excitation, and euphoria.

Thiamine is essential for the decarboxylation of pyruvate, and deficiency during this metabolic process is thought to cause damage to the medial thalamus and mammillary bodies of the posterior hypothalamus, as well as generalized cerebral atrophy. These brain regions are all parts of the limbic system, which is heavily involved in emotion and memory.

KS involves neuronal loss, that is, damage to neurons; gliosis, which is a result of damage to supporting cells of the central nervous system, and bleeding also occurs in mammillary bodies. Damage to the medial dorsal nucleus or anterior nuclei of the thalamus (limbic-specific nuclei) is also associated with this disorder. Cortical dysfunction may have arisen from thiamine deficiency, alcohol neurotoxicity, and/or structural damage in the diencephalon.

Originally, it was thought that a lack of initiative and a flat affect were important characteristics of emotional presentation in those affected. Studies have questioned this, proposing that neither is necessarily a symptom of KS. Research suggesting that people with Korsakoff syndrome are emotionally unimpaired has made this a controversial topic. It can be argued that apathy, which is a usual characteristic, reflects a deficit of emotional &quot;expressions&quot;, without affecting the &quot;experience&quot; or perception of emotion.

KS causes deficits in declarative memory in most people, but leaves implicit spatial, verbal, and procedural memory functioning intact. People with KS have deficits in the processing of contextual information. Context memories refers to the where and when of experiences, and is an essential part of recollection. The ability to store and retrieve this information, such as spatial location or temporal order information, is impaired.
Research has also suggested that people with Korsakoff syndrome have impaired executive functions, which can lead to behavioral problems and interfere with daily activities. It is unclear, however, which executive functions are affected most. Nonetheless, IQ is usually not affected by the brain damage associated with Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome.

At first it was thought that those with KS used confabulation to fill in memory gaps. However, it has been found that confabulation and amnesia do not necessarily co-occur. Studies have shown that there is dissociation between provoked confabulation, spontaneous confabulation (which is unprovoked), and false memories. That is, people affected could be led to believe certain things had happened which actually had not, but so could people without Korsakoff syndrome.

==Causes==
Conditions resulting in thiamine deficiency and its effects include chronic alcoholism and severe malnutrition. Alcoholism may co-occur with poor nutrition, which in addition to inflammation of the stomach lining, causes thiamine deficiency. Other causes include dietary deficiencies, prolonged vomiting, eating disorders, and the effects of chemotherapy. It can also occur in pregnant women who have a form of extreme morning sickness known as hyperemesis gravidarum. Mercury poisoning can also lead to Korsakoff syndrome. Though it does not always co-occur, this disorder can emerge frequently as a consequential result of Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy.

PET scans show that there is a decrease of glucose metabolism in the frontal, parietal and cingulated regions of the brain in those with Korsakoff syndrome. This may contribute to memory loss and amnesia. Structural neuroimaging has also shown the presence of midline diencephalic lesions and cortical atrophy.

Structural lesions of the central nervous system, though rare, can also contribute to symptoms of KS. Severe damage to the medial dorsal nucleus inevitably results in memory deficit. Additionally, autopsies of people who had KS have showed lesions in both the midline and anterior thalamus, and thalamic infarctions. Bilateral infarctions to the thalamus can result in Korsakoff-induced amnesia as well. These findings imply damage to anterior thalamic nuclei can result in disruptive memory.

==Risk factors==
A number of factors may increase a person&#x27;s risk to develop Korsakoff syndrome. These factors are often related to general health and diet.
* Age
* Alcoholism
* Chemotherapy
* Dialysis
* Extreme dieting
* Genetic factors

==Diagnosis==
KS is primarily a clinical diagnosis; imaging and lab tests are not necessary.

==Prevention==
The most effective method of preventing AKS is to avoid thiamine deficiency. In Western nations, the most common causes of such a deficiency are alcoholism and eating disorders. Because these are behavioral-induced causes, Korsakoff syndrome is essentially considered a preventable disease. Thus, fortifying foods with thiamine, or requiring companies that sell alcoholic beverages to supplement them with B vitamins in general or thiamine in particular, could avert many cases.

==Treatment==
It was once assumed that anyone with KS would eventually need full-time care. This is still often the case, but rehabilitation can help regain some, albeit often limited, level of independence. Treatment involves the replacement or supplementation of thiamine by intravenous or intramuscular injection, together with proper nutrition and hydration. However, the amnesia and brain damage caused by the disease does not always respond to thiamine replacement therapy. In some cases, drug therapy is recommended. Treatment typically requires taking thiamine orally for 3 to 12 months, though only about 20 percent of cases are reversible. If treatment is successful, improvement will become apparent within two years, although recovery is slow and often incomplete.

As an immediate form of treatment, a pairing of intravenous or intramuscular thiamine with a high concentration of B-complex vitamins can be administered three times daily for 2–3 days. In most cases, an effective response will be observed. A single dose of 1 gram of thiamine can also be administered to achieve a clinical response. In those who are seriously malnourished, the sudden availability of glucose without proper bodily levels of thiamine to metabolize is thought to cause damage to cells. Thus, the administration of thiamine along with an intravenous form of glucose is often good practice.

Treatment for the memory aspect of KS can also include domain-specific learning, which when used for rehabilitation is called the method of vanishing cues. Such treatments aim to use intact memory processes as the basis for rehabilitation. Those who used the method of vanishing cues in therapy were found to learn and retain information more easily.

People diagnosed with KS are reported to have a normal life expectancy, presuming that they abstain from alcohol and follow a balanced diet. Empirical research has suggested that good health practices have beneficial effects in Korsakoff syndrome.

==Epidemiology==
Rates vary between countries, but it is estimated to affect around 12.5% of heavy drinkers.

== Ferdinand/Elefant ==
The &quot;Ferdinand/Elefant&quot; (Sd.Kfz. 184, and known as &quot;Panzerjäger Tiger&quot; (P)) used the chassis of Porsche&#x27;s VK 4501 (P) which had been produced before the design was rejected, due to its complex Porsche-designed powerplant, in favour of the Henschel design which became the Tiger. Two over-stressed Maybach HL120 water-cooled V-12 engines were installed instead to drive the generators and electric motors for the final drives. On top of this chassis, a forward-facing 88 mm L/71 gun was mounted.

== Development of tank manufacturing ==
German manufacturing of tanks began in 1934, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. German industry had not produced arms in many years, and time was required to develop the necessary techniques for hardening steel and for the development of tooling to produce arms. The first tank type produced was the two-man, Panzer I light tank, designed and produced by the Krupp works as a training vehicle. It was not designed for use in combat; instead, the main battle tank of the German army was to be the Panzer III but delays in its development and manufacture led to the production of an interim vehicle, the Panzer II, which began production the following year. It was not clear yet how tanks would be used in the next war, nor was it apparent that tank-versus-tank combat would be important; some military theorists envisioned tanks operating in support of infantry. The cavalry arm of the Heer saw the major function of tanks to be that of reconnaissance. This was in marked conflict with the ideas of the armoured warfare proponents of Germany, chiefly Heinz Guderian, Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma, and Walther von Reichenau. It was not until 1937–38 that the first Panzer III and Panzer IV medium tanks began to appear.

Noting that Germany was the third largest producer of automobiles in the world, Guderian projected that Germany would be competitive with its major adversaries, a rather optimistic projection since Germany had great difficulty replacing vehicle losses throughout the war, the United States had been considered a non-combatant, and it ignored Soviet production capacity.

Early in development the Heer settled on the concept of the tank having a commander who was in radio communication with his superiors. Thus the basic design of the main battle tanks called for a larger turret that would house the tank commander, gunner and loader, while a driver and a machine gunner were down in the hull. Guderian insisted on the tank commander being in radio communication with both his platoon and with the members of his own tank crew. Though the Panzer III was conceived as the main battle tank of the Wehrmacht, the Wehrmacht did not anticipate being at war with Europe&#x27;s major powers in 1939, and few were available at the start of the war. Excluding Czech-built tanks, on 1 September 1939 the invasion of Poland was undertaken with the German armoured force of 3,195 tanks evenly split between the Pz I training tank and the Pz II light tank; of the main battle tanks, only 98 Pz IIIs were in service during the invasion of Poland, along with 211 Pz IVs, with 215 tanks of various models also available as command tanks after being modified by having their main armament removed and extra communications equipment installed.

== Manufacturing control==
The production of tanks in Germany began in 1934. Due to the insertion of the Nazi Party into the procurement process and political considerations that had nothing to do with the goal of providing arms for the military, the companies that ended up gaining the contracts for tank production had limited actual experience in mass production. Ford and Opel, two manufacturers with considerable knowledge and ability in assembly line techniques, were not allowed to participate in the bidding process. Germany in general and the German tank production industry in particular was not prepared for the total war that Germany was entering in 1939. In contrast to the Messerschmitt Bf109 fighter aircraft, which was designed by Willy Messerschmitt with the production of large numbers of the aircraft in mind, tank design and production in Germany in 1939 was the work of craftsmen. German industry anticipated supporting the military in brief conflicts. A full commitment to war production was not made until the midpoint in the conflict. Surprisingly, civilian vehicle production was not set aside until 1943. By contrast British car companies switched to war production (making military transports, aircraft and tanks) at the start of the war and the United States halted production of civilian automobiles within two months of its entry into the war in late 1941, with autoplants converted to military-only production of arms, munitions, trucks, tanks and planes.

In the run up to the outbreak of war, the large companies engaged in tank production did not have space set aside for expanding their production lines. In consequence, unlike allied manufacturers, German tank manufacturers never came to a point where they were stockpiling and storing excess finished products. Though these companies did expand with the increased demand of the ongoing war, it was not until the assignment of Albert Speer as Minister of Armaments that true efforts were made to bring mass production techniques to the German tank production industry.

During the period before the war, all companies with the exception of Alkett (which was under the control of Rhine-Metal Borsig, a subsidiary of the government-controlled Hermann Göring Works) were privately owned stock companies with the stock available for purchase by the public. All these companies, with the exception again of Alkett, produced tanks in addition to their normal peacetime manufacture of trucks, locomotives, and other heavy equipment. From 1935 onward, the government progressively increased its control over industries engaged in rearmament. The Nazi Party&#x27;s Four Year Plan introduced in 1936 placed Hermann Göring in leadership of the state&#x27;s efforts to bring industry into state control. Through threat and coercion Göring was able to expand the Nazi Party&#x27;s control of private industry involved in steel and armament production. By 1938, this control included the rationing of essential raw materials, factory inventories, labor hours, rates of pay, working conditions, building and machine tool expansion, plant locations and stock dividends. All companies were forced to join the Economic Board of the tank industry which handled all questions affecting the industry.

== Location of German tank manufacturing industry ==
The tank manufacturing industry in Germany was not concentrated in any one geographic location. Major plants were located in Nuremberg, Kassel, Brunswick, Magdeburg, and Berlin. There was, however, some geographical concentration of tank component manufacturers, such as engines and gears in Friedrichshafen, hulls, turrets, and guns in the Ruhr, rubber treads in Hanover, and instruments in Berlin. These locations, if interdicted, represented a potential chokepoint to German tank manufacturing.

== German tank problem ==
During the course of the war the Allies made sustained efforts to determine the extent of German productivity, and approached this in two major ways: conventional intelligence gathering and statistical estimation. In many cases statistical analysis substantially improved on conventional intelligence. In some cases conventional intelligence was used in conjunction with statistical methods, as was the case in estimation of Panther tank production just prior to D-Day.

The allied command structure had thought the Panther tanks seen in Italy were an unusual heavy tank, and would only be seen in northern France in small numbers, much the same way as the Tiger I was seen in Tunisia. The US Army was confident that the Sherman tank would perform well against the German &quot;Mk III&quot; and &quot;IV&quot; tanks which they expected to meet. Shortly before the landings in northern France, rumours indicated that large numbers of Panther tanks were being used in the panzer divisions.

To ascertain if this were true the Allies attempted to estimate the number of Panther tanks being produced. To do this they made use of the serial numbers printed on captured or destroyed German tanks. The principal numbers used were gearbox numbers, as these fell in two unbroken sequences. Chassis and engine numbers were also used, though their use was more complicated. Various other components were used to cross-check the analysis. Similar analyses were done on tires, which were known to be sequentially numbered. The analysis of Panther tank wheels yielded an estimate for the number of wheel molds that were in use. A discussion with British road wheel makers then allowed the estimation of the number of wheels that could be produced from this many molds. This in turn yielded the total number of Panthers that were being produced each month. Analysis of road wheels from the two tanks obtained yielded an estimate of 270 Panthers produced in February 1944 alone, substantially more than had previously been suspected.

German records after the war showed production for the month of February 1944 was 276. The statistical approach proved to be far more accurate than conventional intelligence methods, and the phrase &quot;German tank problem&quot; became accepted as a descriptor for the statistical analysis used.

<doc id="332026" wikidata="Q1601611" url="?curid=332026" title="Hot cross bun">
<text>A hot cross bun is a spiced bun, usually containing small pieces of raisins and marked with a cross on the top, which has been traditionally eaten on Good Friday in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, India, Pakistan, Malta, United States and the Commonwealth Caribbean. They are available all year round in some countries, including the UK.

The bun marks the end of the season of Lent and different elements of the hot cross bun each have a specific meaning, such as the cross representing the crucifixion of Jesus, the spices inside signifying the spices used to embalm him and sometimes also orange peel reflecting the bitterness of his time on the cross.

==History==
The Greeks in the 6th century AD may have marked cakes with a cross.

In the Christian tradition, the making of buns with a cross on them and consuming them after breaking the fast on Good Friday, along with &quot;crying about &#x27;Hot cross buns, is done in order to commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus. It is hypothesised that the contemporary hot cross bun of Christianity derives at some distance from a bun developed in St Albans in England. There in 1361, Brother Thomas Rodcliffe, a Christian monk at St Albans Abbey, developed a similar recipe called an &quot;Alban Bun&quot; and distributed the bun to the poor on Good Friday.

In 1592, during the reign of Elizabeth I of England, the London Clerk of Markets issued a decree forbidding the sale of spiced buns and other spiced breads, except at burials, on Good Friday, or at Christmas. The punishment for transgressing the decree was forfeiture of all the forbidden product to the poor. As a result, hot cross buns at the time were primarily made in domestic kitchens. Further attempts to suppress the sale of these items outside of these holy days took place during the reign of James I of England (1603–1625).

The first definite record of hot cross buns comes from a London street cry: &quot;Good Friday comes this month, the old woman runs. With one or two a penny hot cross buns&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Poor Robin&#x27;s Almanac&quot; for 1733. The line &quot;One a penny, two a penny, hot cross-buns&quot; appears in the English nursery rhyme &quot;Hot Cross Buns&quot; published in the &quot;London Chronicle&quot; for 2–4 June 1767. Food historian Ivan Day states, &quot;The buns were made in London during the 18th century. But when you start looking for records or recipes earlier than that, you hit nothing.&quot;

==Traditions==

English folklore includes many superstitions surrounding hot cross buns. One is that if the bun was made from dough kneaded for the host
and baked and served on Good Friday, it would not spoil or grow mouldy during the subsequent year. Much the same was claimed for sacrificial bread in Classical times before Christianity. Another belief encourages keeping such a bun for medicinal purposes. A piece of it given to someone who is ill is said to help them recover.

If taken on a sea voyage, hot cross buns are said to protect against shipwreck. If hung in the kitchen, they are said to protect against fire and ensure that all breads turn out perfectly. The hanging bun is replaced each year.

==Other versions==
In the United Kingdom, the major supermarkets produce variations on the traditional recipe such as toffee, orange-cranberry, salted caramel and chocolate, and apple-cinnamon.

In Australia, recent variations of the Hot Cross Bun by major supermarkets have included chocolate chip, sour cherry, burger sauce, Iced VoVo, Pizza Shapes, Vegemite and cheese, jalapeño and cheese, and others.

In Jamaica and some Commonwealth Caribbean islands, the hot cross bun has over time evolved into a &quot;spiced Easter bun&quot; with the addition of molasses, spices and a loaf shape. This bun is eaten with cheese in islands such as Jamaica and Guyana and served with beverages such as mauby or ginger beer.

In Slovakia and in the Czech Republic, &quot;mazanec&quot; is a similar cake or sweet bread eaten at Easter. It often has a cross marked on top.

==The cross==

The traditional method for making the cross on top of the bun is to use shortcrust pastry, though some 21st century recipes recommended a paste of flour and water.

<text>Nenagh ( ; , or simply &#x27;the Fair&#x27;) is the county town of County Tipperary in Ireland. Nenagh used to be a market town, and the site of the East Munster Ormond Fair.

Nenagh was the county town of the former county of North Tipperary. It became the second-largest urban centre in the amalgamated county, with a population of 9,895 in 2022. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.

== Geography ==
Nenagh, the largest town in northern County Tipperary, lies to the west of the Nenagh River, which empties into Lough Derg at Dromineer, 9 km to the north-west, a centre for sailing and other water sports. The Silvermine Mountain range lies to the south of the town, with the highest peak being Keeper Hill () at 694 m. The Silvermines have been intermittently mined for silver and base metals for over seven hundred years. Traces of 19th century mine workings remain.

The area has a mild climate, with the average daily maximum in July of 19 °C and the average daily minimum in January of 3 °C.

== History ==
Nenagh is in the Barony of Ormond Lower, which was the traditional territory of the O&#x27;Kennedys before the Norman invasion of Ireland. This land was included in the grant made by King John of England to Theobald, the eldest son of Hervey Walter of Lancashire, England. Theobald was subsequently appointed &quot;Chief Butler of Ireland&quot;.
Nenagh Castle was built and was the main castle of the Butler family before they moved to Gowran, County Kilkenny in the 14th century. The family later purchased Kilkenny Castle, which was to be the main seat of their power for the next 500 years. The town was one of the ancient manors of the Butlers, who received the grant of a fair from Henry VIII of England. They also founded the medieval priory and hospital of St John the Baptist, just outside the town, at Tyone. A small settlement grew up around the castle, but it never seems to have been of any great importance other than as a local market throughout the medieval period. An important Franciscan friary was founded in the town in 1252 in the reign of Henry III of England, which became the head of the Irish custody of West Ireland and was one of the richest religious houses in Ireland. The Abbey was in use for six hundred years; Fr. Patrick Harty, who died in 1817, was its last inhabitant.

In the rebellion of 1641 Nenagh Castle was garrisoned by George Hamilton for James Butler, the twelfth Earl of Ormonde (later the first Duke). It was taken by Phelim O&#x27;Neill in 1648 during Owen Roe&#x27;s journey south via the silver mines but was re-taken by Murrough O&#x27;Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin in the same year and George Hamilton was back again as governor to face Major-General Henry Ireton and Colonel Daniel Abbott in 1650. After a short siege he surrendered on articles and was allowed to march out — not being hung out of the top window as asserted by many writers following an error apparently first made by a writer in the &quot;Dublin Penny Journal&quot; in 1833. Abbott then became governor for the Cromwellians and withstood attacks on the Castle both by Colonel Grace from Birr and a Captain Loghlen O&#x27;Meara of a local family who defeated his forces in an engagement close by and forced them to take shelter in the Castle. After the Restoration, Sir William Flower came along in 1660 on behalf of the Marchioness of Ormond, who had the ownership of the Manor on her marriage settlements.
The last Marquess (James Butler) died in 1997. Without a male heir, the marquessate became extinct, while the earldom is dormant.

The town seems to have been refounded in the 16th century. In 1550, the town and friary were burned by O&#x27;Carroll. In 1641 the town was captured by Red Owen O&#x27;Neill, but shortly afterwards it was recaptured by Lord Inchiquin. It surrendered to Ireton in 1651 during the Cromwellian period and was burned by Patrick Sarsfield in 1688 during the Williamite Wars. Apart from the Castle and Friary, most of the town&#x27;s buildings date from the mid-18th century onward when its sale out of Butler ownership led to the large-scale grant of leases and the subsequent growth of industries and buildings. The town&#x27;s growth and development was accelerated in 1838 when the geographical county of Tipperary was divided into two ridings and Nenagh became the administrative capital of the North Riding. In this period Daniel O&#x27;Connell held one of his Monster meetings for Repeal of the Act of Union at Grange outside of Nenagh.

In the 19th century, Nenagh was primarily a market town, providing services to the agricultural hinterland. Industries included brewing, corn processing, coach building and iron works with the addition of cottage industries such as tailoring, dressmaking, millinery, shoemaking, carpentry, wood-turning, wheelwrighting, harnessmaking, printing, and monumental sculpting. In the middle of the 19th century, Nenagh was affected by the Famine. The Nenagh Co-operative Creamery was established in 1914 providing employment in milk processing and butter-making.

== Politics and governance ==
The town is part of the nine-member municipal district of Nenagh for elections to Tipperary County Council and is part of the Tipperary constituency. Nenagh was the county town of the former county of North Tipperary, abolished in 2014.

== Built heritage ==
The town&#x27;s historic features include Nenagh Castle, the Heritage Centre and the ruined Franciscan abbey.

=== Nenagh Castle ===

This Norman keep was built by Theobald Walter, 1st Baron Butler and completed by his son Theobald le Botiller c1220.
The circular keep is over thirty metres high and its base has a diameter of sixteen metres. It is one of the finest of its kind in Ireland. The crown of crenellations and ring of clerestory windows were added at the instigation of Bishop Michael Flannery in 1861. The intention was that the keep would become the Bell tower of a Pugin-designed cathedral that was never built. The keep now features on the logos of a number of local clubs and businesses including Nenagh Town Council. The castle and grounds were extensively renovated between 2009 and 2013. This project was aimed to position the castle as a key tourist attraction in the area. It is now open to the public.

=== Other historic buildings ===



The old jail, with its octagonal governor&#x27;s residence, is now an historic monument. Only one jail block remains intact. The Governor&#x27;s Residence and jail gatehouse house Nenagh &amp; District Heritage Centre.

Nenagh Courthouse was built in 1843 to the design of architect John B. Keane. The design was similar to his previous courthouse in Tullamore, which in turn followed William Morrison&#x27;s designs for Carlow and Tralee. In 2002, the grounds of the refurbished courthouse became the site of bronze sculptures of Matt McGrath, Bob Tisdall and Johnny Hayes, three Olympic gold medalists with Nenagh links. After the county council moved to their new Civic Offices in 2005, the courthouse was subsequently refurbished.
Nenagh Arts Centre (formerly the Town Hall) is a distinctive building built in 1895. It was refurbished and now features a theatre and multi-purpose exhibition space. Until 2005 it housed the offices of Nenagh Town Council and up until the 1980s Nenagh Public library. The building was designed by the then Town Engineer Robert Gill (father of Tomás Mac Giolla).

St Mary&#x27;s of the Rosary Catholic Church is a neo-gothic church and was built in 1895 to a design by architect Walter G Doolin. It was constructed by John Sisk using Lahorna stone and Portroe slate with the Portland stone of the arches being the only imported material.

The adjacent St Mary&#x27;s Church of Ireland Church was built in 1862 to a design by the architect Joseph Welland (1798–1860) and features a stained glass window from the studio of Harry Clarke. The building is striking in its simplicity in contrast to its larger and more ornate neighbour.

The town also contains the ruins of a Franciscan Friary, where the Annals of Nenagh were written and the medieval Priory of St John on the outskirts of the town at Tyone.

=== Modern buildings ===
The new Civic Offices on the Limerick Road house Tipperary County Council offices. Designed by ABK Architects, the building won international recognition for its design.

Nenagh Hospital, known locally as St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital, located on the Thurles Road (c1940). It is the only general hospital in north Tipperary. Built in the International Style of mostly flat roof and rendered walls the hospital was retro-fitted with uPVC windows at a later date. There is an adjoining mortuary church with notable mosaics and stained glass.

== Transport ==
Nenagh is situated on the R445 Regional Road, which links it to the M7. The M7 by-passes the town to the south and provides high quality access to the cities of Limerick and Dublin. The N52 National Secondary Route to Birr (and through the Midlands to Dundalk) starts/terminates south of Nenagh, at a junction with the M7. This route also bypasses Nenagh to the north and connects with the M7 to the west of the town towards Limerick.

=== Bus ===
Nenagh is connected to other main towns and cities by bus services. The main carriers are JJ Kavanagh and Sons, Bus Éireann and Bernard Kavanagh &amp; Sons. Both JJ Kavanagh and Sons and Bus Éireann now offer services 24 hours a day to Dublin and Limerick with JJ Kavanagh buses offering direct services to both Dublin and Shannon airports. The town centre bus stops are located at Banba Square. Nenagh railway station is also served infrequently by a small number of journeys on Bus Éireann route 323. Local Link Tipperary operates bus service 854 between Nenagh and Roscrea with intermediate stops in stops in Toomevara, Moneygall, Cloughjordan and Shinrone. The service operates seven days a week with three departures in each direction.
=== Rail ===
Nenagh railway station is on the Limerick to Ballybrophy line. Passengers can connect at Ballybrophy to trains heading northeast to Dublin or southwest to Cork or Tralee. The station opened on 5 October 1863.

A committee (the Nenagh Rail Steering Committee) working in conjunction with Irish Railway News, had a meeting with the national railway company Iarnród Éireann (IÉ) on 1 September 2005 to present the results of a traffic study funded by Nenagh Town Council and North Tipperary County Council, and to seek a morning and evening service between Nenagh and Limerick which would increase commuter traffic. IÉ agreed to delay an afternoon service from the December 2005 timetable and to work towards an early service when equipment permitted from 2007. A January 2012 national newspaper article suggested that Irish Rail was expected to seek permission from the National Transport Authority to close the line.

Nenagh is only 37 km from Thurles, which is on the main Dublin/Cork line, and which has around 18 trains daily in each direction, including non-stop services to and from Dublin. However, there are only two buses each weekday from Nenagh to Thurles (and vice versa).

== Sport ==
=== Gaelic games ===
Nenagh Éire Óg is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club and has had a number successes in County Championships in both football and hurling, winning the County Senior Hurling Championship in 1995. The club has also been represented on Senior All-Ireland winning Tipperary hurling teams by Mick Darcy (1925), Jack Darcy (1925), John McGrath (1958), Mick Burns (1958, 1961, 1962, 1964 &amp; 1965), Michael Cleary (1989 &amp; 1991), Conor O’Donovan (1989 &amp; 1991), John Heffernan (1989), Hugh Maloney (2010), Michael Heffernan (2010), Barry Heffernan (2016 &amp; 2019), Dáire Quinn (2016) and Jake Morris (2019).

=== Rugby union ===
Rugby Union club Nenagh Ormond RFC was the first club in County Tipperary to gain senior status by being promoted to the third division of the Rugby AIB League in 2005. The All-Ireland League club has produced three full Irish International players: Tony Courtney in the 1920s and more recently Trevor Hogan, Cronan Gleeson and Donnacha Ryan.

=== Association football ===
Nenagh is home to Nenagh A.F.C. (1951) and Nenagh Celtic F.C. (1981). Nenagh A.F.C.&#x27;s home grounds are Brickfields and Islandbawn. Nenagh Celtic&#x27;s home ground is the VEC grounds. Nenagh Celtic have won a number of titles in their history.

=== Athletics ===

The local athletic club Nenagh Olympic were named after three men (Johnny Hayes, Matt McGrath and Bob Tisdall) with Nenagh connections who won Olympic gold medals and the badge of the club is three interlocking Olympic Rings in green, white and orange. A statue of the three has been erected in Banba Square in the grounds of the Courthouse. The club has produced athletes like Gary Ryan, who represented Ireland at the Olympics. The club also possesses Ireland&#x27;s first and to date only international standard indoor athletics track at Tyone. Many championships are held there including Munster championships and all Ireland championships.

=== Golf ===
Nenagh Golf Club located at Beechwood on the &quot;Old Birr Road&quot; was affiliated to the Golfing Union of Ireland in 1929. The original 9-hole course was designed by Alister McKenzie, who along with Bobby Jones designed the legendary Augusta National. The course was expanded to 18 holes by Eddie Hackett in 1973. The course was expanded to during the 1980s and 1990s and redevelopment to a new design by Patrick Merrigan was completed in 2001.

<text>Ryan Davies (22 January 1937 – 22 April 1977) was a Welsh comedian, actor, musician, singer, and songwriter. Though his career lasted just 11 years, he became widely known in Wales through his work with Ronnie Williams as the comedic double act Ryan and Ronnie.

==Early life==
Davies was born in Glanamman on 22 January 1937. He was educated in Bangor and at London&#x27;s Central School of Speech and Drama.

==Career==

Davies&#x27; first professional appearance was in the National Eisteddfod of Wales in Aberavon in 1966. His talents were quickly recognised by BBC Wales, and he made his name on Welsh-language television shows such as the sitcom &quot;Fo a Fe&quot;. Meredydd Edwards, the head of Light Entertainment, brought Davies and Ronnie Williams together as a double act and the pair had immediate success, first in their Welsh-language television show &quot;Ryan a Ronnie&quot;. This also launched them onto the concert and cabaret circuit across Wales.

The duo&#x27;s show became so popular that it was moved to BBC1 and broadcast in English, winning them a much wider audience, and three series were shown between 1971 and 1973. Davies&#x27; speciality was dressing up as a &quot;typical&quot; Welsh housewife for a weekly sketch on the show known as &quot;Our House&quot;, in which he played &quot;Mam&quot; and Williams played Will, the father. The two were hugely popular in Wales, and were the first comedians to make TV series in both Welsh and English. They were often thought of fondly as the Welsh answer to Morecambe and Wise.

Davies had a simultaneous solo career as an actor, singer, pianist, and songwriter. He had a role in the 1972 film &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. His best known compositions are &quot;Hen Geiliog y Gwynt&quot;, &quot;Nadolig Pwy a Wyr&quot;, and &quot;Blodwen a Meri&quot;. 

Other songs written by Davies and performed with Williams in their television series have been covered by other artists, including &quot;Ti a dy ddoniau&quot; being covered by Jodie Marie and &quot;Yn y bore&quot; being covered by Emyr Wyn Gibson and Steve Pablo Jones.

Davies and Williams split in 1975, citing Williams&#x27; ill health as the official reason, though Williams would ultimately outlive Davies by 20 years. 

Following Williams&#x27; decision to stop performing, Davies pursued a solo career, with a live show at the Swansea Top Rank nightclub. The evening saw Davies give a notable performance of &quot;Myfanwy&quot;, a song he described as &quot;The greatest love song ever written&quot;. The live recording of this version was included on Davies&#x27; album &quot;Ryan at the Rank&quot;, with the song quickly became one of Davies&#x27; most notable and familiar performances. The album itself is now regarded as a classic.

Davies continued to appear extensively on television and in traditional Christmas pantomime appearances in at the Swansea Grand Theatre.

==Personal life==
Ryan married his childhood sweetheart Irene; they had a daughter named Bethan and a son named Arwyn, the latter of whom also became an actor.

==Death==
On 22 April 1977, Davies died suddenly of an asthma attack while visiting American friends in Buffalo, New York. He was 40 years old. One of his own songs, &quot;Pan Fo&#x27;r Nos yn Hir&quot;, was performed at his funeral. It has since been covered by other performers, including Rhydian Roberts and the Whitland Male Voice Choir.

==Filmography==
*&quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; (1972) – Second Man

<text>Captain James Butler White, DFC, RNAS (7 July 1893 – 2 January 1972) was a World War I Royal Naval Air Service flying ace.

White was born on Manitoulin Island, Ontario, Canada.

He served with No. 8 Naval Squadron RNAS, which was renamed No. 208 Squadron RAF after the Royal Naval Air Service was merged with the Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force in 1918. He achieved 12 victories in total, his first on 24 January 1918 and his last two on 3 October 1918. All of his victories were scored while flying a Sopwith Camel.

The citation for his Distinguished Flying Cross (published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 3 December 1918) read:

:A fine fighting pilot who has accounted for eight enemy aeroplanes. He has led numerous offensive and low bombing raids, and by his able and daring leadership has achieved great success with a minimum of casualties to his patrol.

After the war, White entered the finance industry in Toronto. He started his own brokerage company and was eventually President of the Toronto Stock Exchange.

<doc id="332042" wikidata="Q1545625" url="?curid=332042" title="Strappado">
<text>The strappado, also known as corda, is a form of torture in which the victim&#x27;s hands are tied behind their back and the victim is suspended by a rope attached to the wrists, typically resulting in dislocated shoulders. Weights may be added to the body to intensify the effect and increase the pain. This kind of torture would generally not last more than an hour without rest, as it would otherwise likely result in death.

Other names for strappado include &quot;reverse hanging&quot;, &quot;Palestinian hanging&quot; and . It was employed by the medieval Inquisition and many governments, such as the civil law court (1543–1798) of the Order of St. John at the Castellania in Valletta, Malta.

The proper application of the strappado technique causes permanent but not visible damage. The levels of pain and resistance vary by victim depending on the victim&#x27;s weight and any additional weights added to the body. It is not, as Samuel Johnson erroneously entered in &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, a &quot;chastisement by blows.&quot;

==Variants==

There are three variants of this torture. In the first, victims have their arms tied behind their backs; a large rope is then tied to the wrists and passed over a pulley, beam or a hook on the roof. The torturer pulls on this rope until the victim is hanging from the arms. Since the hands are tied behind the victim&#x27;s back, this will cause a very intense pain and possible dislocation of the arms. The full weight of the subject&#x27;s body is then supported by the extended and internally rotated shoulder sockets. While the technique shows no external injuries, it can cause long-term nerve, ligament or tendon damage. The technique typically causes brachial plexus injury, leading to paralysis or loss of sensation in the arms. Prolonged suspension may eventually cause infarction of the muscles of the shoulder and chest wall and subsequent rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and eventual death.

The second variation, known as squassation, is similar to the first, but a series of drops are added, meaning that the victim is allowed to drop until his or her fall is suddenly checked by the rope. In addition to the damage caused by the suspension, the painful jerk would cause major stress to the extended and vulnerable arms, leading to broken shoulders. It is believed that this form of strappado was employed on Niccolò Machiavelli during his 1513 imprisonment after allegedly conspiring against the Medici family in Florence, who were also his primary patrons.

In the third variant, the victim&#x27;s hands are tied to the front. The victim is also hung from the hands, but the ankles are tied and a heavy weight is attached to them. This will cause pain and possible damage not only to the arms, but also to the legs and hips.

==History==
According to William Godwin, Girolamo Savonarola was tortured by strappado multiple times before being put to death in a trial by ordeal (fire). However, Savonarola apparently renounced his confessions after being tortured, and he was sentenced to be burned at the stake. This device was thought to be used during the Salem witch trials of Salem, Massachusetts in 1692 to torture accused witches.

==Modern instances==
The &quot;ropes&quot; was one of several torture methods employed at the Hỏa Lò Prison, popularly known among Americans as the Hanoi Hilton during the 1964–1973 era of the Vietnam War. The site was used by the North Vietnamese Army to house, torture, and interrogate captured servicemen, mostly American airmen shot down during bombing raids. The aim of the torture was usually not to acquire information, but to break the will of the prisoners, both individually and as a group, and to extract written or recorded statements from the prisoners that would be critical of American conduct of the war and praise their captors.

According to a 1997 Human Rights Watch report, this technique was &quot;widely employed&quot; by the security forces of Turkey, where it is &quot;usually used together with high-pressure water, electric shock, beating, or sexual molestation such as squeezing the testicles or breast or placing a nightstick against or in the vagina or anus.&quot; In 1996, the European Court of Human Rights found Turkey guilty of torture for its use of reverse hanging. Turkey has been admonished by Amnesty International and other international human rights groups concerning the use of the technique.

In 2003, one of the Bulgarian nurses interrogated during the HIV trial in Libya, Snezhana Dimitrova, stated that she had been tortured in this way.

They tied my hands behind my back. Then they hung me from a door. It feels like they are stretching you from all sides. My torso was twisted and my shoulders were dislocated from their joints from time to time. The pain cannot be described. The translator was shouting, &quot;Confess or you will die here&quot;.

In November 2003, suspected terrorist Manadel al-Jamadi was tortured to death at Abu Ghraib prison during a Central Intelligence Agency interrogation by members of the U.S. military. It was revealed in February 2005 that al-Jamadi had died after 30 minutes of interrogation, during which he was suspended by the wrists bound behind his back.

Richard Belmar has stated that he was repeatedly subjected to this torture method as a punishment during his extrajudicial detention at the Parwan Detention Facility in Afghanistan from 2002–2005.

In 2017, video footage was released of Iraqi Army members inflicting strappado torture following successes in the Battle of Mosul.

In March 2023, the European Court of Human Rights found Ukraine in violation of the prohibition against torture, alleging that in November 2003 police made use of strappado to coerce prisoner Mykola Slyvotskyy into falsely confessing his guilt for two murders that another person had previously confessed to committing.

Strappado is sometimes used as a variant of the helicopter position for torture in Eritrea as of the early twenty-first century.

<text>Pyramids is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, published in 1989, the seventh book in his &quot;Discworld&quot; series. It won the BSFA Award for Best Novel in 1989.

==Plot summary==
The main character of &quot;Pyramids&quot; is Teppic (short for Pteppicymon), the crown prince of the tiny kingdom of Djelibeybi (a pun on the candy Jelly Baby, meaning &quot;Child of the Djel&quot;), the Discworld counterpart to Ancient Egypt. The kingdom, founded seven-thousand years ago and formerly a great empire which dominated the continent of Klatch, has been in debt and recession for generations due to the construction of pyramids for the burial of its pharaohs (primarily on prime agricultural land) and now occupies an area two miles wide along the 150-mile-long River Djel.

Young Teppic has been in training at the Assassins Guild in Ankh-Morpork for the past seven years, having been sent to bring in revenue for the kingdom. The day after passing his final exam by chance, he mystically senses that his father, Pteppicymon XXVII, has died and that he must return home. Being the first Djelibeybian king raised outside the kingdom leads to some interesting problems, as Dios, the high priest, is a stickler for tradition, and does not actually allow the pharaohs to rule the country.

When plans are being laid out for the old pharaoh&#x27;s tomb, Teppic (now Pteppicymon XXVIII) mentions that his father did not wish to be buried in a pyramid; in reaction to Dios&#x27;s rejection of this idea, Teppic ends up ordering the construction of a pyramid twice the size of the largest one previously built in Djelibeybi. Whilst the pyramid-building Ptaclusp dynasty work out how to build the pyramid within budget and on time (eventually taking advantage of the unfinished pyramid&#x27;s premature temporal distortions), the late Pteppicymon XXVII spends his time observing the embalming of his mortal remains and taking an interest in the lives of his embalmers, Dil and Gurn.

After numerous adventures and misunderstandings, Teppic is forced to escape from the palace with a handmaiden named Ptraci, who was condemned to death for not wishing to die and serve the late pharaoh in the afterlife (effectively on Dios&#x27; orders since Teppic wished to pardon her). However, during the attempt, Dios discovers them and decrees that Teppic has killed the King (as the King is only recognised whilst wearing the Mask of the Sun and Dios reasons that Teppic&#x27;s actions to save Ptraci would not be those of the King) and should be put to death. Meanwhile, the massive pyramid warps space-time so much that it &quot;rotates&quot; Djelibeybi out of alignment with the space/time of the rest of the Disc by ninety degrees.

After Teppic and Ptraci manage to escape Djelibeybi, they travel to Ephebe to consult with the philosophers there as to how to get back. Meanwhile, pandemonium takes hold in Djelibeybi, as the kingdom&#x27;s multifarious gods (many of whom occupy the same roles, such as Supreme God, God of the Sun, or God of the Djel) descend upon the populace, and all of Djelibeybi&#x27;s dead rulers come back to life. Also, the nations of Ephebe and Tsort prepare for war with one another, as Djelibeybi can no longer act as a buffer zone between the two.

Eventually, Teppic re-enters the Kingdom and attempts to destroy the Great Pyramid, with the help of all of his newly resurrected ancestors. They are confronted by Dios, who, it turns out, is as old as the kingdom itself, and has advised every pharaoh throughout its history. Dios hates change and thinks Djelibeybi should stay the same. Teppic succeeds in destroying the Pyramid, returning Djelibeybi to the real world and sending Dios back through time (where he meets the original founder of the Kingdom, thereby restarting the cycle). Teppic then abdicates, allowing Ptraci (who turns out to be his half-sister) to rule. Ptraci immediately institutes much-needed changes, Teppic decides to travel the Disc, Death comes to ferry the former rulers of Djelibeybi to the afterlife, and Djelibeybi&#x27;s former embalmers and pyramid-builders adjust to life without the pyramids.

==Characters==
*Teppic (short for Pteppicymon XXVIII), who left the kingdom to train at the Assassin&#x27;s Guild of Ankh-Morpork as a boy, thus regarding himself more as Morporkian than Djelibeybian
*Dios, the High Priest of Djelibeybi and chief minister
*Pteppicymon XXVII, the late king of Djelibeybi and Teppic&#x27;s father
*Chidder, one of Teppic&#x27;s classmates
*Arthur Ludorum, one of Teppic&#x27;s classmates and the son of Johan Ludorum, a famous assassin
*Cheesewright, one of Teppic&#x27;s classmates
*Ptraci, a handmaiden of the late king and Teppic&#x27;s half-sister
*Dil and Gurn, master and apprentice embalmers tasked with mummifying Pteppicymon XXVII
*Ptaclusp I, Ptaclusp IIa and Ptaclusp IIb, the pyramid-building dynasty tasked with the construction of the Great Pyramid

==Major themes==
The novel portrays a &quot;time polder&quot;, a bubble which comprises a particular slice of history and a particular bit of geography. In this &quot;polder&quot;, history repeats itself through Dios, and critic Stefan Ekman argues that a central theme of the novel is the struggle breaking free from the &quot;polder&quot;, of leaving one&#x27;s background behind.

<doc id="332053" wikidata="Q7843696" url="?curid=332053" title="Tripontium">
<text>Tripontium (Latin for &quot;Place of three bridges&quot;) was a town in Roman Britain. It lay on the Roman road later called Watling Street (and known today as the A5) at a site now chiefly within the civil parish of Churchover in the English county of Warwickshire and partly in Leicestershire, some 3.4 miles north-east of Rugby and 3.1 miles south of Lutterworth.

==Character==
Tripontium was established as a military frontier post soon after the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 47. Its name references the bridges over the River Avon and two of its tributaries. Tripontium later developed into a civilian town which was inhabited for around 400 years, peaking in the 2nd century, before being abandoned in the late 4th century when the Romans left Britain.

==Excavations==
The exact position of Tripontium remained a mystery for centuries, but it was found by the antiquarian Matthew Bloxam in 1836. Excavation works at the site were begun in 1961 by the Rugby Archaeological Society and have continued to 2006.

From its out-of-the-way location, it was initially thought that Tripontium was a small wayside settlement of little importance. Excavations of the site have, however, revealed that it was an important Romano-British town, with large public bath houses, an extensive administrative building, and an inn (&quot;&quot;) . Numerous pieces of pottery, Roman coins, and other remains have been found. Some of the area of the town has been destroyed by gravel extraction in modern times and part of the site is unavailable for excavation. Nevertheless, it seems highly likely that more buildings, such as the remains of a temple or a forum, remain to be found at the site. The excavation of Tripontium has been the largest of its type to be carried out by an amateur archaeological society.

Tripontium was probably the most important Roman settlement in the area. The town is some 8 miles south of Venonae (High Cross), the point at which Watling Street crossed the Fosse Way. The large size of the bathhouses and inn have led historians to conclude that Tripontium is likely to have been an important stopping-place for travellers, both military and civilian. It was probably also an administrative centre for the surrounding area. The town was mentioned as a stopping place in the Antonine Itineraries, a third century document which recorded the places the Roman Emperors stopped and those they passed through.

The site is a scheduled ancient monument. It has been placed on the Heritage at Risk Register due to the risks from unlicensed metal detecting and its condition is declining.

The site is not open to the public, but many of the finds from the excavations are on display at the Rugby Art Gallery and Museum and the Lutterworth Museum.

<text>Bodie ( ) is a ghost town in the Bodie Hills east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in Mono County, California, United States. It is about southeast of Lake Tahoe, and east-southeast of Bridgeport, at an elevation of 8,379 feet (2554 m). Bodie became a boom town in after the discovery of a profitable vein of gold; by 1879 it had established 2,000 structures with a population of roughly 8,000 people.

The town went into decline in the subsequent decades and came to be described as a ghost town by . The U.S. Department of the Interior recognizes the designated Bodie Historic District as a National Historic Landmark.

Also registered as a California Historical Landmark, the ghost town officially was established as Bodie State Historic Park in 1962. It receives about 200,000 visitors yearly. Bodie State Historic Park is partly supported by the Bodie Foundation.

== History ==

=== Discovery of gold ===
Bodie began as a mining camp of little note following the discovery of gold in 1859 by a group of prospectors, including W. S. Bodey. Bodey died in a blizzard the following November while making a supply trip to Monoville (near present-day Mono City), never able to see the rise of the town that was named after him. According to area pioneer Judge J. G. McClinton, the district&#x27;s name had been &quot;Bodey,&quot; &quot;Body,&quot; and a few other orthographic variations. After a painter in the nearby boomtown of Aurora, lettered a sign &quot;Bodie Stables,&quot; it was then standardized to &quot;Bodie.&quot;

Gold discovered at Bodie coincided with the discovery of silver at nearby Aurora (thought to be in California, later found to be Nevada), and the distant Comstock Lode beneath Virginia City, Nevada. But while these two towns boomed, interest in Bodie remained lackluster. By 1868 only two companies had built stamp mills at Bodie, and both had failed.

=== Boom ===
In 1876, the Standard Company discovered a profitable deposit of gold-bearing ore, which transformed Bodie from an isolated mining camp comprising a few prospectors and company employees to a Wild West boomtown. Rich discoveries in the adjacent Bodie Mine during 1878 attracted even more hopeful people. By 1879, Bodie had a population of approximately 7,000–10,000 people and around 2,000 buildings. One legend says that in 1880, Bodie was California&#x27;s second or third largest city, but the U.S. Census of that year disproves this. Over the years 1860–1941 Bodie&#x27;s mines produced gold and silver valued at an estimated (in 1986 dollars, or $85 million in 2021).

Bodie boomed from late 1877 through mid to late 1880. The first newspaper, &quot;The Standard Pioneer Journal of Mono County&quot;, published its first edition on October 10, 1877. Starting as a weekly, it soon expanded publication to three times a week. It was also during this time that a telegraph line was built which connected Bodie with Bridgeport and Genoa, Nevada. California and Nevada newspapers predicted Bodie would become the next Comstock Lode. Men from both states were lured to Bodie by the prospect of another bonanza.

Gold bullion from the town&#x27;s nine stamp mills was shipped to Carson City, Nevada, by way of Aurora, Wellington, and Gardnerville. Most shipments were accompanied by armed guards. After the bullion reached Carson City, it was delivered to the mint there, or sent by rail to the mint in San Francisco.

===Districts and amenities===

As a bustling gold mining center, Bodie had the amenities of larger towns, including a Wells Fargo Bank, four volunteer fire companies, a brass band, railroad, miners&#x27; and mechanics&#x27; union, several daily newspapers, and a jail. At its peak, 65 saloons lined Main Street, which was a mile long. Murders, shootouts, barroom brawls, and stagecoach holdups were regular occurrences.

As with other remote mining towns, Bodie had a popular, though clandestine, red light district on the north end of town. There is an unsubstantiated story of Rosa May, a prostitute who, in the style of Florence Nightingale, came to the aid of the town menfolk when a serious epidemic struck the town at the height of its boom. She is credited with giving life-saving care to many, but after she died, was buried outside the cemetery fence.

Bodie had a Chinatown, the main street of which ran at a right angle to Bodie&#x27;s Main Street. At one point it had several hundred Chinese residents and a Taoist temple. Opium dens were plentiful in this area.

Bodie also had a cemetery on the outskirts of town and a nearby mortuary. It is the only building in the town built of red brick three courses thick, most likely for insulation to keep the air temperature steady during the cold winters and hot summers. The cemetery includes a Miners Union section, and a cenotaph erected to honor President James A. Garfield. The Bodie Boot Hill was located outside of the official city cemetery.

On Main Street stands the Miners Union Hall, which was the meeting place for labor unions. It also served as an entertainment center that hosted dances, concerts, plays, and school recitals. It now serves as a museum.

=== Mining town ===

The first signs of decline appeared in 1880 and became obvious toward the end of the year. Promising mining booms in Butte, Montana; Tombstone, Arizona; and Utah lured men away from Bodie. The get-rich-quick, single miners who came to the town in the 1870s moved on to these other booms, and Bodie developed into a family-oriented community. In 1882 residents built the Methodist Church (which still stands) and the Roman Catholic Church (burned 1928). Despite the population decline, the mines were flourishing, and in 1881 Bodie&#x27;s ore production was recorded at a high of $3.1 million. Also in 1881, a narrow-gauge railroad was built called the Bodie Railway &amp; Lumber Company, bringing lumber, cordwood, and mine timbers to the mining district from Mono Mills south of Mono Lake.

During the early 1890s, Bodie enjoyed a short revival from technological advancements in the mines that continued to support the town. In 1890, the recently invented cyanide process promised to recover gold and silver from discarded mill tailings and from low-grade ore bodies that had been passed over. In 1892, the Standard Company built its own hydroelectric plant approximately away at Dynamo Pond. The plant developed a maximum of and 3,530 volts alternating current (AC) to power the company&#x27;s 20-stamp mill. This pioneering installation marked the country&#x27;s first transmissions of electricity over a long distance.
In 1910, the population was recorded at 698 people, which were predominantly families who decided to stay in Bodie instead of moving on to other prosperous strikes.

=== Decline ===

The first signs of an official decline occurred in 1912 with the printing of the last Bodie newspaper, &quot;The Bodie Miner&quot;. In a 1913 book titled &quot;California Tourist Guide and Handbook: Authentic Description of Routes of Travel and Points of Interest in California&quot;, the authors, Wells and Aubrey Drury, described Bodie as a &quot;mining town, which is the center of a large mineral region&quot;. They referred to two hotels and a railroad operating there. In 1913, the Standard Consolidated Mine closed.

Mining profits in 1914 were at a low of $6,821 (~$ in ). James S. Cain bought everything from the town lots to the mining claims, and reopened the Standard mill to former employees, which resulted in an over $100,000 profit in 1915. However, this financial growth was not in time to stop the town&#x27;s decline. In 1917, the Bodie Railway was abandoned and its iron tracks were scrapped.

The last mine closed in 1942, due to War Production Board order L-208, shutting down all non-essential gold mines in the United States during World War II. Mining never resumed after the war.

Bodie was first described as a &quot;ghost town&quot; in 1915. In a time when auto travel was on the rise, many travelers reached Bodie via automobiles. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; published an article in 1919 to dispute the &quot;ghost town&quot; label.

By 1920, Bodie&#x27;s population was recorded by the US Federal Census at a total of 120 people. Despite the decline and a severe fire in the business district in 1932, Bodie had permanent residents through nearly half of the 20th century. A post office operated at Bodie from 1877 to 1942.

=== Ghost town and park ===
In the 1940s, the threat of vandalism faced the ghost town. The Cain family, who owned much of the land, hired caretakers to protect and to maintain the town&#x27;s structures. Martin Gianettoni, one of the last three people living in Bodie in 1943, was a caretaker.

Bodie is now an authentic Wild West ghost town.

The town was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961, and in 1962 the state legislature authorized creation of Bodie State Historic Park. A total of 170 buildings remained. Bodie has been named as California&#x27;s official state gold rush ghost town.

Visitors arrive mainly via SR 270, which runs from US 395 near Bridgeport to the west; the last three miles of it is a dirt road. There is also a road to SR 167 near Mono Lake in the south, but this road is extremely rough, with more than 10 miles of dirt track in a bad state of repair. Due to heavy snowfall, the roads to Bodie are usually closed in winter.

Today, Bodie is preserved in a state of arrested decay. Only a small part of the town survived, with about 110 structures still standing, including one of many once operational gold mills. Visitors can walk the deserted streets of a town that once was a bustling area of activity. Interiors remain as they were left and stocked with goods. Littered throughout the park, one can find small shards of china dishes, square nails, and an occasional bottle, but removing these items is against the rules of the park.

The California State Parks&#x27; ranger station is located in one of the original homes on Green Street.

In 2009 and again in 2010, Bodie was scheduled to be closed. The California state legislature worked out a budget compromise that enabled the state&#x27;s Parks Closure Commission to keep it open. As of 2024, the park is still operating, now administered by the Bodie Foundation.

== Climate ==
Bodie is a rare example of the dry-summer subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dsc&quot;), with hot to freezing summers and long, snowy winters, and is part of USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 5. Winds can sweep across the valley at close to . Nights remain cold even through the summer, often dropping well below freezing throughout the year.

With an average of 303 nights below freezing per year, Bodie rivals Utqiagvik, Alaska&#x27;s 315, and no month has ever been completely frost-free. The fewest nights below freezing in a month was two, the exceptionally warm August 1967, whose mean minimum of was the highest during the twentieth century, although July 1896 had a mean minimum of . Bodie&#x27;s actual highest minimum on record is on August 1 of 1968; however, on average only two nights per year stay above , and minima that high have never occurred between September 14 and June 4.

The longest frost-free period is a mere thirty days from July 20 to August 18, 1901, but to illustrate the vast diurnal temperature range, Bodie had as many as 98 consecutive maxima at or above between June 9 and September 14, 2007 – which included the record hot July 2007 with mean maximum .

The harsh weather is due to a particular combination of high altitude () and a very exposed plateau, with little in the way of a natural surrounding wall to protect the long, flat piece of land from the elements. Plenty of firewood was needed to keep residents warm through the long winters. Bodie is not located in a forest, so lumber had to be imported from Bridgeport, Benton, Carson City, or Mono Mills. The winter of 1878–79 was particularly harsh and claimed the lives of many residents. On average, there are 22.7 days with + highs, 19.6 days where the high fails to rise above freezing, and 35 nights with sub- lows. The record high temperature of was set on July 21, 1988, while the record low of was set on February 13, 1903, which also saw the lowest maximum temperature of .

Average annual precipitation is , with August on average being the driest month and January the wettest. There are an average of 60 days annually with measurable precipitation. The wettest &quot;rain year&quot; was from July 1968 to June 1969 with and the driest was from July 1999 to June 2000 with . The most precipitation in one month was in January 1901, and the most in 24 hours on February 12, 1895. Average annual snowfall is . The snowiest year was 1965 with . The most snow in one month was in January 1969.

<text>The Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival is a 12-day alternative theatre festival held each year in July in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. 

Primarily held in venues in Winnipeg&#x27;s historic Exchange District, it currently ranks as the second-largest independent fringe theatre festivals in North America. The festival is presented by Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre, the only regional theatre in Canada to produce a fringe festival. 

== Overview ==
The festival has three key principles:

# Festival is non-juried;
# Artists have freedom to present whatever they want on stage; and
# 100% of the box office goes directly to the artists (though artists must pay a flat fee to enter).

Chuck McEwen, former director of the Toronto Fringe Festival, is the current executive producer, and has been in charge since 2008.

Winnipeg Fringe is modelled on the Edmonton Fringe Festival, providing several venues for performing companies; however, some companies arrange their own venues, which is more akin to the Edinburgh Fringe festival. Nonetheless, all venues have paid technicians and volunteer ticket sellers and ushers.

The festival&#x27;s venues are centred in Winnipeg&#x27;s historic Exchange District with the Old Market Square serving as the festival&#x27;s outdoor hub. However, as the festival has grown, there have also been venues outside that district but still close to Winnipeg&#x27;s downtown.

The performing companies at the festival are both local and from across Canada and around the world. For example, the 2005 festival featured performers from France, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and South Africa as well as across Canada and the United States.

==History==

The Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival opened in 1988 by the Manitoba Theatre Centre, Canada&#x27;s oldest regional theatre, with Larry Desrochers as the first Executive Producer.

In its first year, ticket sales were 14,000 across nine days of performances. That figure rose to 26,000 in 1989—year two of the festival. It climbed to 44,709 in 1999 and was more than 60,000 in 2001.

In 2008, Chuck McEwen, former director of the Toronto Fringe Festival, became executive producer of the festival.

Paid attendance briefly set a record high for North America in 2009 with 81,565 tickets sold, surpassing the previous record of 77,700 set at the 2006 Edmonton Fringe. (However, the Edmonton Fringe festival currently holds the North American record with 104,142 tickets sold in 2011.)

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre cancelled that year&#x27;s Winnipeg Fringe Festival as a safety precaution. The 2020 festival was scheduled to take place from July 15 to 26. RMTC considered rescheduling the event to late summer or fall but ultimately decided to cancel the physical event. Instead, the RMTC offered free online programming from July 14 to 17 beginning at 7PM nightly. The online festival featured local, national, and international programming including performances from Mike Delamont, Frances Koncan, the Coldhearts, Outside Joke, and Anjali Sandhu. Online festival programming was streamed on YouTube and Facebook.

The festival returned from a two-year hiatus from live performances in 2022.

In 2023, the Fringe introduced a pay-what-you-can model for the five shows presented at the Kids Venue at the Manitoba Theatre for Young People in &quot;an effort to make the festival more affordable for families.&quot; That model continued into 2024.

==Annual theme==

The festival has a different theme each year. Some previous themes have been &quot;the F word&quot; (meaning &quot;fringe&quot;), and James Bond.

In 2010, the theme was The Big Top, referring to circuses, with a giant, helium-filled balloon floating above Old Market Square. In 2012, for the 25th anniversary edition of the festival, there was no theme as organizers just &quot;wanted people to get their fringe on.&quot; In 2014, the theme was &quot;We like when you watch.&quot;

The theme in 2015 was &quot;We&#x27;re all &lt;blank&gt; here,&quot; where the blank was filled in variously. On the program, it was &quot;mad,&quot; but on the website for volunteers it was &quot;friends.&quot;

The theme in 2024 was &quot;Gone Fringin&#x27;: Venture into Our Neck of the Woods.&quot;

The Harry S. Rintoul Memorial Award for Best New Manitoba Play at the Winnipeg Fringe Festival was established by the Manitoba Association of Playwrights to recognize the best play written by a Manitoban and performed at the festival.

<text>St. Edward&#x27;s University is a private, Catholic university in Austin, Texas, United States. It was founded and is operated in the Holy Cross tradition.

==History==
===Founding and early history===
St. Edward&#x27;s University was founded by the Reverend Edward Sorin, Superior General of the Congregation of Holy Cross, who also founded the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana. Father Sorin established the institution on farmland south of Austin in 1877 and named it St. Edward&#x27;s Academy in honor of his patron saint, King Edward the Confessor. The high school section later separated to become St. Edward&#x27;s High School but closed during the 1970s. It is affiliated with the Congregation of Holy Cross.

In 1885, President P.J. Franciscus secured a charter and changed the name to St. Edward&#x27;s College. Enrollment increased. The first school newspaper, the organization of baseball and football teams, and approval to start building an administration building all followed. Architect Nicholas J. Clayton of Galveston, Texas was commissioned to design the college&#x27;s Main Building. The structure was built four stories tall in the Gothic Revival style and was constructed with local white limestone.
===Twentieth century===
In 1903, a fire destroyed the majority of Main Building, but it was rebuilt by the fall. In 1922, Main Building sustained damage from a tornado that caused significant damage all over the campus. Main Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. In 1925, St. Edward&#x27;s received its university charter. Most of the personnel at the time were Holy Cross priests and brothers. Women arrived at St. Edward&#x27;s in 1966 as students for Maryhill College, a coordinate institution. By 1970, Maryhill was absorbed and St. Edward&#x27;s became co-educational.

By 1971, the university granted bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in business administration. Also added were the College Assistance Migrant Program, or CAMP (1972); a professionally oriented Theater Arts curriculum (1972); a degree program for adults called New College (1974); and Freshman Studies (1975). In 1984, Patricia Hayes became the second layperson to lead St. Edward&#x27;s University. In 1990, enrollment reached 3,000 for the first time. This decade also ushered in civic initiatives and capital improvements.

St. Edward&#x27;s endowment, as of 2015, stood at more than $92.4 million.

===Expansion (1999present)===
George E. Martin served as the institution&#x27;s 23rd president. From Fall 1999–Summer 2021, Martin oversaw a period of expansion for St. Edward&#x27;s that included transforming the campus through the construction of many new buildings, doubling enrollment, growing the endowment, building global partnerships and founding the Holy Cross Institute to sustain the mission of the Brothers of the Congregation of Holy Cross. In February 2022, Montserrat Fuentes was inaugurated as the 24th president and first Hispanic president of St. Edward&#x27;s University. As part of her presidential inaugural address, Fuentes unveiled the university&#x27;s Strategic Plan 2027.

====New buildings and renovations====
Trustee Hall, a academic facility, opened in fall 2002. In 2003, Basil Moreau Hall, a co-ed freshmen residence hall opened. The John Brooks Williams Natural Sciences Center–North facility that opened in fall 2006, was the first of a two-building science complex and houses the biology and chemistry programs in the School of Natural Sciences. The John Brooks Williams Natural Sciences Center–South opened in fall 2013. It houses the computer science, mathematics and physics programs, and features 13 classrooms, advanced computer and math labs, and a 126-seat auditorium.

A 756-car parking garage opened in 2007. Major renovations of existing campus buildings include Premont Hall (2006), Fleck Hall (2007) and Doyle Hall (2009). A new residential village opened in 2009. A renovated campus library, formerly the Scarborough-Phillips Library, opened in fall 2013 as The Munday Library. The library features global digital classrooms for video conferencing, revamped reading, study and meeting spaces, an expanded digital collection, and writing and media centers. The library renovation was funded in 2011 by a $13 million donation from Bill and Pat Munday. The Mundays also donated $20 million for university scholarships in 2013. Both donations were school records.

<doc id="332079" wikidata="Q370766" url="?curid=332079" title="Ground truth">
<text>Ground truth is information that is known to be real or true, provided by direct observation and measurement (i.e. empirical evidence) as opposed to information provided by inference.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (s.v. &quot;ground truth&quot;) records the use of the word &quot;Groundtruth&quot; in the sense of &#x27;fundamental truth&#x27; from Henry Ellison&#x27;s poem &quot;The Siberian Exile&#x27;s Tale&quot;, published in 1833.

== Usage ==
The term &quot;ground truth&quot; can be used as a noun, adjective, and verb.
* Noun: &quot;ground truth&quot; (no hyphen). Example: &quot;The ground truth is essential for training accurate models.&quot;
* Adjective: &quot;ground-truth&quot; (hyphenated compound adjective). Example: &quot;We need to use ground-truth data to validate the model.&quot;
* Verb: &quot;to ground-truth&quot; or &quot;to groundtruth&quot; (compound verb,). Example: &quot;We need to ground-truth the results to ensure their accuracy.&quot;

== Statistics and machine learning ==
&quot;Ground truth&quot; may be seen as a conceptual term relative to the knowledge of the truth concerning a specific question. It is the ideal expected result. This is used in statistical models to prove or disprove research hypotheses. The term &quot;ground truthing&quot; refers to the process of gathering the proper objective (provable) data for this test. Compare with gold standard.
For example, suppose we are testing a stereo vision system to see how well it can estimate 3D positions. The &quot;ground truth&quot; might be the positions given by a laser rangefinder which is known to be much more accurate than the camera system.

Bayesian spam filtering is a common example of supervised learning. In this system, the algorithm is manually taught the differences between spam and non-spam. This depends on the &quot;ground truth&quot; of the messages used to train the algorithm – inaccuracies in the ground truth will correlate to inaccuracies in the resulting spam/non-spam verdicts.

== Remote sensing ==
In remote sensing, &quot;ground truth&quot; refers to information collected at the imaged location. Ground truth allows image data to be related to real features and materials on the ground. The collection of ground truth data enables calibration of remote-sensing data, and aids in the interpretation and analysis of what is being sensed. Examples include cartography, meteorology, analysis of aerial photographs, satellite imagery and other techniques in which data are gathered at a distance.

More specifically, ground truth may refer to a process in which &quot;pixels&quot; on a satellite image are compared to what is imaged (at the time of capture) in order to verify the contents of the &quot;pixels&quot; in the image (noting that the concept of &quot;pixel&quot; is imaging-system-dependent). In the case of a classified image, supervised classification can help to determine the accuracy of the classification by the remote sensing system which can minimize error in the classification.

Ground truth is usually done on site, correlating what is known with surface observations and measurements of various properties of the features of the ground resolution cells under study in the remotely sensed digital image. The process also involves taking geographic coordinates of the ground resolution cell with GPS technology and comparing those with the coordinates of the &quot;pixel&quot; being studied provided by the remote sensing software to understand and analyze the location errors and how it may affect a particular study.

Ground truth is important in the initial supervised classification of an image. When the identity and location of land cover types are known through a combination of field work, maps, and personal experience these areas are known as training sites. The spectral characteristics of these areas are used to train the remote sensing software using decision rules for classifying the rest of the image. These decision rules such as Maximum Likelihood Classification, Parallelopiped Classification, and Minimum Distance Classification offer different techniques to classify an image. Additional ground truth sites allow the remote sensor to establish an error matrix that validates the accuracy of the classification method used. Different classification methods may have different percentages of error for a given classification project. It is important that the remote sensor chooses a classification method that works best with the number of classifications used while providing the least amount of error.

Ground truth also helps with atmospheric correction. Since images from satellites have to pass through the atmosphere, they can get distorted because of absorption in the atmosphere. So ground truth can help fully identify objects in satellite photos.

===Errors of commission===
An example of an error of commission is when a pixel reports the presence of a feature (such a tree) that, in reality, is absent (no tree is actually present). Ground truthing ensures that the error matrices have a higher accuracy percentage than would be the case if no pixels were ground-truthed. This value is the inverse of the user&#x27;s accuracy, i.e. Commission Error = 1 - user&#x27;s accuracy.

===Errors of omission===
An example of an error of omission is when pixels of a certain type, for example, maple trees, are not classified as maple trees. The process of ground-truthing helps to ensure that the pixel is classified correctly and the error matrices are more accurate. This value is the inverse of the producer&#x27;s accuracy, i.e. Omission Error = 1 - producer&#x27;s accuracy

== Geographical information systems ==
In GIS the spatial data is modeled as &quot;field&quot; (like in remote sensing raster images) or as &quot;object&quot; (like in vectorial map representation). They are modeled from the real world (also named &quot;geographical reality&quot;), typically by a cartographic process (illustrated).

Geographic information systems such as GIS, GPS, and GNSS, have become so widespread that the term &quot;ground truth&quot; has taken on special meaning in that context. If the location coordinates returned by a location method such as GPS are an estimate of a location, then the &quot;ground truth&quot; is the actual location on Earth. A smart phone might return a set of estimated location coordinates such as 43.87870,-103.45901. The ground truth being estimated by those coordinates is the tip of George Washington&#x27;s nose on Mount Rushmore. The accuracy of the estimate is the maximum distance between the location coordinates and the ground truth. We could say in this case that the estimate accuracy is 10 meters, meaning that the point on earth represented by the location coordinates is thought to be within 10 meters of George&#x27;s nose—the ground truth. In slang, the coordinates indicate where we think George Washington&#x27;s nose is located, and the ground truth is where it really is. In practice a smart phone or hand-held GPS unit is routinely able to estimate the ground truth within 6–10 meters. Specialized instruments can reduce GPS measurement error to under a centimeter.

==Military usage==
US military slang uses &quot;ground truth&quot; to refer to the facts comprising a tactical situation—as opposed to intelligence reports, mission plans, and other descriptions reflecting the conative or policy-based projections of the industrial·military complex. The term appears in the title of the Iraq War documentary film &quot;The Ground Truth&quot; (2006), and also in military publications, for example &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; saying: &quot;Stripes decided to figure out what the ground truth was in Iraq.&quot;

<text>The Metropolitan Council, commonly abbreviated Met Council or Metro Council, is the regional governmental agency and metropolitan planning organization in Minnesota serving the Twin Cities seven-county metropolitan area, accounting for over 55 percent of the state&#x27;s population. 

The Met Council is granted regional authority powers in state statutes by the Minnesota Legislature. These powers are unique in that unlike the Regional Development Commissions they can supersede decisions and actions of local governments. The legislature created the Metro Council to maintain public services, oversee growth of the state&#x27;s largest metro area and to act as the regional planning organization. Like the Metro in Portland, Oregon, it also administers an urban growth boundary.

The Council&#x27;s role in the Twin Cities metro area is defined by the necessary regional services it provides and manages. These include public transportation, sewage treatment, regional planning, urban planning for municipalities, forecasting population growth, ensuring adequate affordable housing, maintaining a regional park and trails system, and &quot;provides a framework for regional systems including aviation, transportation, parks and open space, water quality and water management.&quot;

The Council has survived multiple reform attempts after being accused of mismanagement and lack of accountability, notably over the construction of the Southwest LRT, though state lawmakers continue to develop plans to remake the Council.

==Governance and structure==

The Met Council has 17 members, 16 of whom represent a geographic district in the seven-county area with one chair who serves at large. All members are appointed by the Governor of Minnesota and are reappointed with each new governor in office. The Minnesota Senate may confirm or reject each appointment. 

The seven counties in the Council&#x27;s Twin Cities Metropolitan Area are Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington counties.

Geographic districts vary in characteristics but were historically drawn by population percentage and the presence of major natural resources. Districts near the downtown core are much smaller while the edge districts encompass large amounts of rural land. For example, District 3 contains almost all of Lake Minnetonka and its tributaries and watershed.

The Met Council employs about 4,300 people, and their wage data are publicly accessible.

==Duties==

=== General duties ===
The Council delivers regional services to communities and the public through these divisions and operating areas:

* Regional Administration/Chair&#x27;s Office – Generally sets the goals and direction the Council will take with the metro area. It also manages finances and makes budget decisions on how shared funding and grant programs are distributed amongst the region.
* Community Development – The majority of land use, regional, urban, and community planning occur with this division. It also develops and administers regional and municipal frameworks as well as the long-range vision plans.
* Transportation – This division includes Metro Transit, the authority that provides most bus service and operates light rail and commuter rail lines. Metropolitan Transportation Services (MTS) includes the staff that support the Council&#x27;s role as the Metropolitan Planning Organization for the region. It also analyzes and develops future transportation options. However, road and street corridor planning is left to county and city governments. The metropolitan highway system is planned in coordination with the Minnesota Department of Transportation. Additional public transit agencies also exist under an agreement in state law that allows them to &quot;opt-out&quot; of Metro Transit service. The largest agencies are Southwest Metro Transit in the west and Minnesota Valley Transportation Authority in the south.
* Environmental Services – MCES is mandated to address water quality, water supply, and sewage treatment. It also has full jurisdiction of the wastewater treatment system (within the MUSA boundary). This includes maintenance and construction of wastewater interceptors and operation of seven wastewater treatment plants throughout the metro area. Treatment of drinking water and storm run-off water management are left to municipalities.
* Municipal Urban Service Area (MUSA) – While not a division, the MUSA is an urban growth boundary which instead of limiting development, limits the services and infrastructure needed for development. Its most important service is the sewage treatment system. Growth is controlled because state law prohibits septic tank systems, and most cities require development to be connected to a system.

=== Tax sharing ===
The council&#x27;s most distinctive authority is its ability to tax and share the tax revenue between municipalities through the Minnesota Fiscal Disparities Program. This program, first implemented in 1975, made the Twin Cities region the first region to attempt tax-base sharing in the country. The funds are then largely redistributed back to the localities with lower than average market value of property per capita.

==History==
In 1967 the Minnesota Legislature created the Metropolitan Council in response to growing issues of septic tank wastewater contamination. At the time, the region consisted of &quot;172 cities, 97 townships, and 76 school districts&quot;. The region also faced issues with a deteriorating privately-owned bus system.

Additional acts of the legislature passed in 1974, 1976, and 1994 expanded the role and powers of the Met Council, merging it with transit and waste control commissions to become a unified regional authority. The Met Council also gained the authority to approve or disapprove of municipal development plans and to manage the region&#x27;s affordable housing programs.

Current efforts are ongoing to transfer responsibility of the METRO Blue Line extension, a light‑rail project connecting Minneapolis to the suburbs of Robbinsdale, Crystal, and Brooklyn Park from the Met Council to Minnesota&#x27;s Department of Transportation. The council has controversially overseen the almost $3 billion project while it has been delayed an additional four years and as costs rose $450 million to $550 million.

===Chairs===

==Controversy==
The Met Council has long raised the ire of suburban residents in the region. For instance, one source of controversy has been the council&#x27;s power to invalidate the land use plans of municipalities which conflict with its own. 

In 2004, the city of Lake Elmo refused to allow higher‑density development despite the Met Council&#x27;s comprehensive development guide. The city challenged the Council&#x27;s statutory authority to compel the city to modify its comprehensive plan in order to reach minimum density levels. However, the Minnesota Supreme Court found the city&#x27;s argument unpersuasive &quot;when viewed against the plain and unambiguous language of the statutes at issue.&quot;

Shortly after the 2010 Minnesota elections, Minnesota Legislative Auditor James Nobles recommended on January 21, 2011, that &quot;the Legislature should restructure the governance of the Metropolitan Council&quot; (page 41). The Legislative Auditor continued stating that &quot;Maintaining an appointed Met Council would continue the Council&#x27;s accountability problems ... Because Council members are appointed by the governor, however, they are not directly accountable to the public for (their) decisions.&quot; This lack of credibility and accountability was reported on by newspapers such as the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot;, the &quot;Star Tribune&quot;, and online editorials like Politics In Minnesota.

Marty Seifert, a Republican candidate for governor in the 2014 election, also called for the abolition of the Council, citing it as an unelected authority with taxation powers without representation. However, most of the responsibilities of the Metropolitan Council would still need to be maintained, including a Metropolitan Planning Organization that allows the region to receive federal transportation funding.

Criticisms of the council reached a high point in 2018 when the Met Council survived two attempted reforms at both the state and the federal level.

In late 2023, the Met Council came under fire again with a state legislative committee, the Metropolitan Governance Task Force, tasked with examining reformation, be it through elections or other means. In February 2024, the task force came up with six reformation paths, but the state legislature will need to take further action as warranted.

In May 2024, after years of mounting delays, cost overruns and mismanagement of the Southwest LRT, the Minnesota State Legislature passed a law giving the Minnesota Department of Transportation greater oversight of future transit projects. Transportation-focused State Senator Scott Dibble (politician) sponsored the change, calling the Met Council &quot;incompetent and incapable.&quot;

<text>In computability theory, a set &quot;S&quot; of natural numbers is called computably enumerable (c.e.), recursively enumerable (r.e.), semidecidable, partially decidable, listable, provable or Turing-recognizable if:

*There is an algorithm such that the set of input numbers for which the algorithm halts is exactly &quot;S&quot;. 

Or, equivalently,

*There is an algorithm that enumerates the members of &quot;S&quot;. That means that its output is a list of all the members of &quot;S&quot;: &quot;s&quot;1, &quot;s&quot;2, &quot;s&quot;3, ... . If &quot;S&quot; is infinite, this algorithm will run forever, but each element of S will be returned after a finite amount of time. Note that these elements do not have to be listed in a particular way, say from smallest to largest.

The first condition suggests why the term &quot;semidecidable&quot; is sometimes used. More precisely, if a number is in the set, one can &quot;decide&quot; this by running the algorithm, but if the number is not in the set, the algorithm can run forever, and no information is returned. A set that is &quot;completely decidable&quot; is a computable set. The second condition suggests why &quot;computably enumerable&quot; is used. The abbreviations c.e. and r.e. are often used, even in print, instead of the full phrase.

In computational complexity theory, the complexity class containing all computably enumerable sets is RE. In recursion theory, the lattice of c.e. sets under inclusion is denoted formula_1.

== Formal definition ==

A set &quot;S&quot; of natural numbers is called computably enumerable if there is a partial computable function whose domain is exactly &quot;S&quot;, meaning that the function is defined if and only if its input is a member of &quot;S&quot;.

==Equivalent formulations==
The following are all equivalent properties of a set &quot;S&quot; of natural numbers:

;Semidecidability:
:*The set &quot;S&quot; is computably enumerable. That is, &quot;S&quot; is the domain (co-range) of a partial computable function.
:*The set &quot;S&quot; is formula_2 (referring to the arithmetical hierarchy).
:*There is a partial computable function &quot;f&quot; such that: formula_3
;Enumerability:
:*The set &quot;S&quot; is the range of a partial computable function.
:*The set &quot;S&quot; is the range of a total computable function, or empty. If &quot;S&quot; is infinite, the function can be chosen to be injective.
:*The set &quot;S&quot; is the range of a primitive recursive function or empty. Even if &quot;S&quot; is infinite, repetition of values may be necessary in this case.
;Diophantine:
:*There is a polynomial &quot;p&quot; with integer coefficients and variables &quot;x&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;i&quot; ranging over the natural numbers such that formula_4 (The number of bound variables in this definition is the best known so far; it might be that a lower number can be used to define all Diophantine sets.)
:*There is a polynomial from the integers to the integers such that the set &quot;S&quot; contains exactly the non-negative numbers in its range.

The equivalence of semidecidability and enumerability can be obtained by the technique of dovetailing.

The Diophantine characterizations of a computably enumerable set, while not as straightforward or intuitive as the first definitions, were found by Yuri Matiyasevich as part of the negative solution to Hilbert&#x27;s Tenth Problem. Diophantine sets predate recursion theory and are therefore historically the first way to describe these sets (although this equivalence was only remarked more than three decades after the introduction of computably enumerable sets).

==Examples==
* Every computable set is computably enumerable, but it is not true that every computably enumerable set is computable. For computable sets, the algorithm must also say if an input is &quot;not&quot; in the set – this is not required of computably enumerable sets.
* A recursively enumerable language is a computably enumerable subset of a formal language.
* The set of all provable sentences in an effectively presented axiomatic system is a computably enumerable set.
* Matiyasevich&#x27;s theorem states that every computably enumerable set is a Diophantine set (the converse is trivially true).
* The simple sets are computably enumerable but not computable.
* The creative sets are computably enumerable but not computable.
* Any productive set is not computably enumerable.
* Given a Gödel numbering formula_5 of the computable functions, the set formula_6 (where formula_7 is the Cantor pairing function and formula_8 indicates formula_9 is defined) is computably enumerable (cf. picture for a fixed &quot;x&quot;). This set encodes the halting problem as it describes the input parameters for which each Turing machine halts.
* Given a Gödel numbering formula_5 of the computable functions, the set formula_11 is computably enumerable. This set encodes the problem of deciding a function value.
* Given a partial function &quot;f&quot; from the natural numbers into the natural numbers, &quot;f&quot; is a partial computable function if and only if the graph of &quot;f&quot;, that is, the set of all pairs formula_12 such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is defined, is computably enumerable.

==Properties==

If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are computably enumerable sets then &quot;A&quot; ∩ &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot; ∪ &quot;B&quot; and &quot;A&quot; × &quot;B&quot; (with the ordered pair of natural numbers mapped to a single natural number with the Cantor pairing function) are computably enumerable sets. The preimage of a computably enumerable set under a partial computable function is a computably enumerable set.

A set formula_13 is called co-computably-enumerable or co-c.e. if its complement formula_14 is computably enumerable. Equivalently, a set is co-r.e. if and only if it is at level formula_15 of the arithmetical hierarchy. The complexity class of co-computably-enumerable sets is denoted co-RE.

A set &quot;A&quot; is computable if and only if both &quot;A&quot; and the complement of &quot;A&quot; are computably enumerable.

Some pairs of computably enumerable sets are effectively separable and some are not.

== Remarks ==
According to the Church–Turing thesis, any effectively calculable function is calculable by a Turing machine, and thus a set &quot;S&quot; is computably enumerable if and only if there is some algorithm which yields an enumeration of &quot;S&quot;. This cannot be taken as a formal definition, however, because the Church–Turing thesis is an informal conjecture rather than a formal axiom.

The definition of a computably enumerable set as the &quot;domain&quot; of a partial function, rather than the &quot;range&quot; of a total computable function, is common in contemporary texts. This choice is motivated by the fact that in generalized recursion theories, such as α-recursion theory, the definition corresponding to domains has been found to be more natural. Other texts use the definition in terms of enumerations, which is equivalent for computably enumerable sets.

<text>Aosta ( , , ; ; , or ; or ) is the principal city of the Aosta Valley, a bilingual region in the Italian Alps, north-northwest of Turin. It is situated near the Italian entrance of the Mont Blanc Tunnel and the Great St Bernard Tunnel, at the confluence of the Buthier and the Dora Baltea, and at the junction of the Great and Little St Bernard Pass routes.

==History==

Aosta was settled in proto-historic times and later became a centre of the Salassi, many of whom were killed or sold into slavery by the Romans in 25 BC. The campaign was led by Terentius Varro, who then founded the Roman colony of &quot;Augusta Praetoria Salassorum&quot;, housing 3,000 retired veterans. After 11 BC Aosta became the capital of the Alpes Graies province of the Empire. Its position at the confluence of two rivers, at the end of the Great and the Little St Bernard Pass, gave it considerable military importance, and its layout was that of a Roman military camp.

After the fall of the Western Empire, the city was conquered, in turn, by the Burgundians, the Ostrogoths, and the Byzantines. The Lombards, who had annexed it to their Italian kingdom, were expelled by the Frankish Empire under Pepin the Short. Under his son, Charlemagne, Aosta acquired importance as a post on the Via Francigena, leading from Aachen to Italy. After 888 AD it was part of the renewed Kingdom of Italy under Arduin of Ivrea and Berengar of Friuli.

In the 10th century Aosta became part of the Kingdom of Burgundy. After the fall of the latter in 1032, it became part of the lands of Count Humbert I of Savoy.

The privilege of holding the assembly of the states-general was granted to the inhabitants in 1189. An executive council was nominated from this body in 1536, and continued to exist until 1802. After the Congress of Vienna restored the rule of Savoy it was reconstituted and formally recognized by Charles Albert of Sardinia, at the birth of his grandson Prince Amedeo, who was created duke of Aosta.

==Climate==
Aosta is in the rain shadow of the Mont Blanc massif and features a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa), bordering on a cool semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSk), also bordering on an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb) and under the Köppen climate classification due to its low average annual rainfall. It is considered temperate oceanic (Trewartha: Do) in the Trewartha climate classification. 

The city experiences cool to very cold winters, hot summers and relatively dry conditions throughout the year.

==Main sights==
===Prehistoric===
*Saint-Martin-de-Corléans Megalithic Area with artifacts and tombs dating to the Neolithic era.

===Ancient remains===

The ancient town walls of Augusta Prætoria Salassorum are still preserved almost in their entirety, enclosing a rectangle . They are high, built of concrete faced with small blocks of stone. At the bottom, the walls are nearly thick, and at the top .

Towers stand at angles to the enceinte and others are positioned at intervals, with two at each of the four gates, making twenty towers in total. They are roughly square, and project from the wall. Of the 20 original towers, the following are well preserved:
*&quot;Tour du Lépreux&quot; (French for &quot;Leper&#x27;s Tower&quot;), was given this name after a leper called Pierre-Bernard Guasco who was jailed there in the late 17th century. &quot;Le lépreux de la cité d&#x27;Aoste&quot;, a novel by Xavier de Maistre, is also named after this leper.
*&quot;Tourneuve&quot; (13th century).
*&quot;Tour du Pailleron&quot;.
*Tower (Castle) of Bramafan, built in the 11th century over a Roman bastion. It was the residence of the Savoy viscounts. In Franco-Provençal, &quot;Bramé la fan&quot; means &quot;To scream for hunger&quot;.
*&quot;Tour du Baillage&quot;.
*&quot;Tour Fromage&quot;.

The south and east gates exist intact. The latter, a double gate with three arches flanked by two towers known as the Porta Praetoria (1st century AD) was the eastern gate to the city, and has preserved its original form apart from the marble covering. It is formed by two series of arches enclosing a small square.

The rectangular arrangement of the streets is modeled on a Roman plan dividing the town into 64 blocks (insulae). The main road, about wide, divides the city into two equal halves, running from east to west. This arrangement makes it clear that guarding the road was the main raison d&#x27;être of the city.

The Roman theatre, of which the southern façade remains today, is tall. The structure, dating from the late reign of Augustus, occupied an area of ; it could contain up to 4,000 spectators. In the nearby was the amphitheatre, built under Claudius. A marketplace surrounded by storehouses on three sides with a temple in the centre with two on the open (south) side, as well as a thermae, have also been discovered.

Outside the town walls is the Arch of Augustus, a triumphal arch in honour of Augustus, built in 35 BC to celebrate the victory of consul Varro Murena over the Salassi. About to the west is a single-arched Roman bridge, called the Pont d&#x27;Aël. It has a closed passage, lighted by windows for foot passengers in winter, and above it an open footpath.

There are considerable remains of the ancient road from Eporedia (modern Ivrea) to Augusta Praetoria into the Aosta Valley. The modern railway follows this route, notable for the Pont Saint-Martin, which has a single arch with a span of and a roadway wide; the cutting of Donnas; and the Roman bridges of Cillian (Saint-Vincent) and Aosta (Pont de Pierre).

===Other sights===
*The Cathedral, built in the 4th century and replaced in the 11th century by a new edifice dedicated to the Madonna. It is annexed to the Roman Forum.
*The Romanesque-Gothic &quot;Collegiate church of Saint Ursus&quot; (Saint-Ours). Its most evocative feature is the cloister, which can be entered through a hall on the left of the façade. It is dedicated to Ursus of Aosta.
*The Saint-Bénin College, built about 1000 by the Benedictines. It is now an exhibition site.
*The Bridge of Grand Arvou, a medieval arch bridge-aqueduct.

==Transport==
Aosta lies on the crossroad of two major trans-alpine trunk roads: national road 26 (Italian: SS26, French: RN26) connecting the city of Chivasso to Little St Bernard Pass on the Italy-France border, and national road 27 (Italian: SS27, French: RN27) connecting the city of Aosta to the Great St Bernard Pass on the Italy-Switzerland border. Aosta is also served by the A5 motorway between Turin and Courmayeur.

Aosta railway station, opened in 1886, forms part of the Chivasso–Ivrea–Aosta railway. Direct trains only connect Aosta up to the city of Ivrea. The branch line to nearby Pré-Saint-Didier, in the Valdigne, on the way towards Courmayeur was closed in 2015. Train service is operated by Trenitalia.

The main bus hub is located near the Aosta train station. Buses connect the city of Aosta to the nearby valleys and to destinations outside the region, including Turin, Milan, Chamonix (France) and Martigny (Switzerland).

Aosta airport is located 5 km to the east of the city.

==Identity, land and descent==
Teips being sub-units of tukkhums, members of the same teip are traditionally thought to descend from a common ancestor, and thus are considered distant blood relatives. Teip names were often derived from an ancestral founder. As is also true of many other North Caucasian peoples, traditionally, Chechen and Ingush men were expected to know the names and places of origin of ancestors on their father&#x27;s side, going back many generations, with the most common number being considered 7. Many women also memorized this information, and keener individuals can often recite their maternal ancestral line as well. The memorization of the information serves as a way to impute clan loyalty to younger generations. Among peoples of the Caucasus, traditionally, large scale land disputes could sometimes be solved with the help of mutual knowledge of whose ancestors resided where and when.

A teip&#x27;s ancestral land was thus held as sacred, because of its close link to teip identity. It was typically marked by clan symbols, including the clan cemetery, tower, and sanctuary. Land being scarce in mountainous Ingushetia and Chechnya, after the feudal system was overthrown, each teip claimed a definite area of land. Land boundaries were marked by stones with specific marks pointing to a local place of worship. While at first land was owned collectively, individual cultivation ultimately became the norm. In old Chechen and Ingush tradition, women were allowed to own land. The vehement Ingush and Chechen opposition to Soviet collectivization has been explained by the threat it posed to the traditional customs of land allotment.

==Political function==
Each &quot;teip&quot; had an elected council of elders, a court of justice, and its own set of customs. The civilian chief, referred to as the &quot;thamda&quot; or &quot;kh&#x27;alkhancha&quot;, chaired the council of elders. The &quot;baechcha&quot;, meanwhile, was the military leader.

==Subdivisions==
The teip has its own subdivisions, in order of their progressive nesting, the &#x27;, the &#x27;, and the &#x27;. The &#x27; consists of households sharing the same family name, while the &#x27; is a number of &#x27; units that together form a common lineage, however that is not always the case. The basic social unit, meanwhile, was the household, consisting of the extended family spanning three or four generations, referred to as the tsa&quot; or the &#x27;, with married daughters usually living with in the household of their spouse. Brothers would share the same land and livestock.

==Formation of new teips==
The number of teips has been unstable in recent history. While there were 59 Chechen and Ingush teips in the early 19th century, this swelled to a hundred by the mid-19th century, and today there are about 170. New teips could be founded when a large &quot;&quot; broke off and claimed the title of a full-fledged teip.

<doc id="332100" wikidata="Q370235" url="?curid=332100" title="Graham Hancock">
<text>Graham Bruce Hancock (born 2 August 1950) is a British writer who promotes pseudoscientific ideas about ancient civilizations and hypothetical lost lands. Hancock proposes that an advanced civilization with spiritual technology existed during the last Ice Age until it was destroyed following comet impacts around 12,900 years ago, at the onset of the Younger Dryas. He speculates that survivors of this cataclysm passed on their knowledge to primitive hunter-gatherers around the world, giving rise to all the earliest known civilizations (such as ancient Egypt, Sumeria, and Mesoamerica). 

Born in Edinburgh, Hancock studied sociology at Durham University before working as a journalist, writing for a number of British newspapers and magazines. His first three books dealt with international development, including &quot;Lords of Poverty&quot; (1989), a well-received critique of corruption in the aid system. Beginning with &quot;The Sign and the Seal&quot; in 1992, he shifted focus to speculative accounts of human prehistory and ancient civilizations, on which he has written a dozen books, most notably &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot; and &quot;Magicians of the Gods&quot;. 

Experts have described Hancock&#x27;s investigations of archaeological evidence, myths and historical documents as superficially resembling investigative journalism, but lacking in accuracy, consistency and impartiality. They define his work as pseudoarchaeology and pseudohistory because they consider it to be biased towards preconceived conclusions by ignoring context, misrepresenting sources, cherry picking, and withholding critical counter-evidence. Anthropologist Jeb Card has described Hancock&#x27;s writings as being paranormal in nature, and his idea of an Ice age civilization as a modern mythological narrative that due to its emphasis on alleged secret and spiritual knowledge (including psychic abilities and communing with souls and &quot;powerful nonphysical beings&quot; via the use of psychedelics), is incompatible with the archaeological scientific method. Hancock portrays himself as a culture hero who fights the &quot;dogmatism&quot; of academics, presenting his work as more valid than professional archaeology and as &quot;a path to truly understanding reality and the spiritual elements denied by materialist science&quot;, though he often cites science in support of his ideas. He has not submitted his writings for scholarly peer review and they have not been published in academic journals.

He has also written two fantasy novels and in 2013 delivered a controversial TEDx talk promoting the use of the psychoactive drink ayahuasca. His ideas have been the subject of several films, as well as the Netflix series &quot;Ancient Apocalypse&quot; (2022), Hancock makes regular appearances on the podcast &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; to discuss his work.

==Early life and journalism==
Graham Bruce Hancock was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1950. He moved to India with his parents at the age of three, where his father worked as a surgeon. Having returned to the UK, he graduated from Durham University with a degree in sociology in 1973.

As a journalist, Hancock worked for many British papers, such as &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He co-edited &quot;New Internationalist&quot; magazine from 1976 to 1979, and was the East Africa correspondent of &quot;The Economist&quot; from 1981 to 1983. Before 1990, his works dealt mainly with problems of economic and social development. His book &quot;Lords of Poverty: The Power, Prestige, And Corruption Of The International Aid Business&quot; (1989) was based on his experience writing about international aid for &quot;The Economist&quot;. In the book, Hancock critiques the international aid system, stating in the book &quot;aid is not bad ... because it is sometimes misused, corrupt or crass; rather, it is inherently bad, bad to the bone, and utterly beyond reform&quot;. Critics agreed that Hancock&#x27;s work was a powerful critique of the international aid system, though a number disagreed with Hancock&#x27;s thesis that aid was inherently bad.

During his time as a journalist, he was criticized for being on what he described as &quot;friendly personal terms&quot; with dictator Siad Barre of Somalia (according to &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;he set up a company to publish government-approved coffee table books about Somalia as a multi-racial paradise&quot;) as well as having links to then dictator of Ethiopia Mengistu Haile Mariam, which caused controversy when Hancock wrote a favourable profile of Barre for &quot;The Independent&quot;, as, by his own admission, &quot;various aspects of my trip were facilitated by the [Barre] regime&quot;. He admitted that he &quot;definitely made a mistake&quot; by establishing links to Mengistu.

==Later writing==
Since 1990, Hancock&#x27;s works have focused mainly on speculative connections he makes between various archaeological, historical, and cross-cultural phenomena. He has stated that from about 1987 he was &quot;pretty much permanently stoned ... and I felt that it helped me with my work as a writer, and perhaps at some point it did&quot;, while an article published in &quot;The Independent&quot; in 1995 claims that in 1989 he shifted from working for Barre to investigating the Ark of the Covenant (on which he wasn&#x27;t able to enter due to being blocked by Ethiopian guards), which resulted in his 1992 book, &quot;The Sign and the Seal&quot;. Other books include &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot;, &quot;Keeper of Genesis&quot; (released in the US as &quot;Message of the Sphinx&quot;), &quot;The Mars Mystery&quot;, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Mirror&quot; (with wife Santha Faiia), &quot;Underworld: The Mysterious Origins of Civilization&quot;, and &quot;Talisman: Sacred Cities, Secret Faith&quot; (with co-author Robert Bauval).

In the 1997 book &quot;The Mars Mystery&quot; Hancock speculated based on the low-resolution Viking lander images, that the supposed face on the Cydonia region of Mars, along with a purported &quot;five sided pyramid&quot; may have been the work of an advanced civilisation on Mars that was later destroyed by a cataclysm. In Hancock&#x27;s book &quot;Talisman: Sacred Cities, Secret Faith&quot;, co-authored with Robert Bauval, the two put forward what sociologist of religion David V. Barrett called &quot;a version of the old Jewish-Masonic plot so beloved by ultra-right-wing conspiracy theorists.&quot; They suggest a connection between the pillars of Solomon&#x27;s Temple and the Twin Towers, and between the Star of David and The Pentagon. A contemporary review of &quot;Talisman&quot; by David V. Barrett for &quot;The Independent&quot; pointed to a lack of originality as well as basic factual errors, concluding that it was &quot;a mish-mash of badly-connected, half-argued theories&quot;. In a 2008 piece for &quot;The Telegraph&quot; referencing &quot;Talisman&quot;, Damian Thompson described Hancock and Bauval as fantasists. Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Supernatural: Meetings With the Ancient Teachers of Mankind&quot;, was published in the UK in October 2005 and in the US in 2006. In it, Hancock examines paleolithic cave art in the light of David Lewis-Williams&#x27; neuropsychological model, exploring its relation to the development of the fully modern human mind. In 2015, his &quot;Magicians of the Gods: The Forgotten Wisdom of Earth&#x27;s Lost Civilization&quot; was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press.

In addition to writing Hancock has been involved in a number of television documentaries about his pseudoarchaeological theories. 1996, he appeared in &quot;The Mysterious Origins of Man&quot;. He also wrote and presented the documentaries &quot;Underworld: Flooded Kingdoms of the Ice Age&quot; (2002) and &quot;Quest for the Lost Civilisation&quot; (1998). In 2022 he presented &quot;Ancient Apocalypse&quot;, a Netflix documentary series that was widely viewed but panned by critics and academics.

His first novel, &quot;Entangled: The Eater of Souls&quot;, the first in a fantasy series, was published in 2010. The novel makes use of Hancock&#x27;s prior research interests. He has noted: &quot;What was there to lose, I asked myself, when my critics already described my factual books as fiction?&quot;

==Pseudoarchaeology==
Experts consider Hancock&#x27;s pseudoarchaeological work to be based on cherry picked information, and strident opposition to &quot;mainstream archaeology&quot;. They suggest it superficially resembles investigative journalism, but is neither accurate, consistent or impartial. His ideas are built with references to myths, pseudoscience, outdated scientific models, and cutting-edge science depending on what suits his claims. Hancock aims to erode trust in known facts and archaeological expertise, and responds to criticism with accusations of censorship. Many of his supporters echo his rhetoric and label critics as disinformation agents.

Pseudoarchaeologists mislead their audience by misrepresenting the current state of knowledge, take quotes out of contexts, and withhold countervailing data. Garrett G. Fagan pointed out two typical examples in Hancock&#x27;s book &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot; (1995):
* Hancock wrote that &quot;the best recent evidence suggests that&quot; large regions of Antarctica may have been ice free until about 6,000 years ago, referring to the Piri Reis map and Hapgood&#x27;s work from the 1960s. What is left entirely unmentioned are the extensive studies of the Antarctic ice sheet by George H. Denton, published in 1981, which showed the ice to be hundreds of thousands of years old.
* When discussing the ancient city of Tiwanaku, Hancock presents it as a &quot;mysterious site about which very little is known&quot; and that &quot;minimal archaeology has been done over the years&quot;, suggesting it dates to 17,000 years ago. Yet in the years prior to these statements dozens of studies had been published, major excavations were conducted and the site was radiocarbon dated by three sets of samples to around 1500 BC.

=== Lost ice age civilization ===
Hancock&#x27;s main thesis throughout most of his work is that there was an advanced civilization during the last Ice Age, which was destroyed as a result of a widespread natural disaster, causing the small number of survivors to travel the world, spreading their knowledge and giving rise to the earliest known civilizations. He does not accept that these civilizations could have arisen independently or that faraway peoples developed the same ideas, arguing that they all came from one advanced ice age civilization. It is a form of hyperdiffusionism based on Ignatius Donnelly&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; (1882), an influence Hancock has cited. The idea lacks concrete evidence, is biased towards western civilization, and oversimplifies complex cultural developments.

To explain the disappearance of his ice age civilization, Hancock embraces the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which has little support in the scientific community. He argues that the civilization was destroyed around 12,000 years ago by sudden climate change during the Younger Dryas cool period, which he attributes to an impact winter caused by a massive meteor bombardment.

Hancock claims that the few survivors of the catastrophe arrived in places like Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Mesoamerica, where they shared their knowledge and superior technology with primitive hunter-gatherers; introducing them to agriculture, monumental architecture, and astronomy. He believes the monuments they built encode astronomical data to warn future humans. The narrative assumes that the advanced civilization lacked a writing system that enabled them to leave a less ambiguous message. Hancock does not explain why this warning is not uniform across different cultures and so hard to decode that generations of researchers missed it.

Hancock believes that these events are preserved in various myths, such as Plato&#x27;s story of Atlantis, and that the Atlanteans were remembered as &quot;magicians and gods&quot;.

Hancock has accepted the fringe theories of other Atlantis proponents regarding several historic sites. For example that of Robert M. Schoch, who contests that the Great Sphinx of Giza was carved over 11,500 years ago, based on claims of the Sphinx having been eroded by water or that of Danny Hilman Natawidjaja, who believes Gunung Padang to be a 27,000 year old Atlantean structure.

Scholars Olav Hammer and Karen Swartz write that Hancock&#x27;s works are &quot;based largely on an imaginative reinterpretation of artifacts and myths that divorces them from their immediate cultural and religious contexts.&quot; 

==== Spiritual technology and Ice age civilisation as myth ====

Hancock believes that the technology his lost Ice Age civilization possessed was primarily spiritual. According to anthropologist Jeb Card, in &quot;America Before&quot; (2019) Hancock describes his advanced Ice Age civilisation as a &quot;global-sea based society comparable with the late pre-industrial British Empire&quot; with knowledge &quot;that would seem like magic even today&quot;, with this knowledge suggested by Hancock to include psychic capabilities. Hancock suggests that the teachings of Atlanteans to later civilisations were &quot;geometric, astronomical and spiritual&quot; in nature, which were faciltated by the use of psychotropic plants (such as ayahuasca and peyote) used to access the Otherworld, allowing them to commune with souls and &quot;powerful nonphysical beings&quot;.

He also proposed that they were able to move and shape large stones with the help of meditation and psychoactive plants, and asserted that granite blocks of the Great Pyramid of Giza were moved by &quot;priests chanting&quot;, suggesting a form of acoustic levitation.

Archaeologist John Hoopes has described Hancock&#x27;s claims as effectively religious in nature and rooted in New Age beliefs. Jeb Card stated that attempts to critique Hancock&#x27;s work &quot;using the criteria of professional archaeology is doomed to failure, as his goals are outside the goals of the materialist practice of scientific archaeology&quot;, describing Hancock as part of the paranormal milieu, and the idea of the ice age civilisation as a mythic narrative rooted in opposition to materialism, describing Hancock as &quot;not a failed version of an archaeologist&quot; but a &quot;successful mythographer of a post-science age&quot;. Olav Hammer and Karen Swartz, both primarily scholars of new religious movements, have also concurred with interpretation of Hancock as a creator of myths, describing him as a &quot;bricoleur who creates a myth from a motley selection of cultural elements&quot;.

==== Racist implications ====
Archaeologists and the author Jason Colavito have criticised Hancock for the origins of some of his claims being drawn from racist sources. For instance, Hancock draws from the work of Donnelly, a proponent of the racist &quot;mound builder myth&quot;, with Donnelly suggesting that the Indigenous peoples of the Americas were not capable of creating sophisticated structures, attributing their creation instead to white Atlanteans. Hancock has distanced himself from this claim, yet failed to explain how a fully competent local population could serve as evidence for a lost civilization that transferred superior science and technology to them. 

Although Hancock has identified the Atlanteans as indigenous Americans, he stated in &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot; that Atlanteans were &quot;white [and] auburn-haired&quot;. Hancock has based some of his work on outdated race science and has argued for the presence of indigenous &quot;Caucasoids&quot; and &quot;Negroids&quot; in the Americas prior to 1492, which he claims are depicted in indigenous American art and mythology. 

The Maya were described by Hancock as only &quot;semi-civilized&quot; and their achievements as &quot;generally unremarkable&quot; to support the thesis that they inherited their calendar from a much older, far more advanced civilization.

Hancock has denied that he is racist, and has expressed support for native rights.

=== Orion correlation theory ===
One of the many recurring themes in several of Hancock&#x27;s works has been an exposition on Robert Bauval&#x27;s Orion correlation theory (OCT). OCT posits that the relative locations of the three largest pyramids of the Giza pyramid complex were chosen by the builders to reflect the three stars of Orion&#x27;s Belt of the constellation Orion. The pyramids are aligned to the cardinal direction within a fraction of a degree, however they are mismatched with Orion&#x27;s Belt exceeding five degrees, noted astronomer Tony Fairall.

Hancock and Bauval&#x27;s Orion correlation theory was the subject of &quot;Atlantis Reborn&quot;, an episode of the BBC documentary series &quot;Horizon&quot; broadcast in 1999. The programme was critical of the theory, demonstrating that the constellation Leo could be found amongst famous landmarks in New York, and alleging that Hancock had selectively moved or ignored the locations of temples to support his argument. It concluded that &quot;as long as you have enough points and you don&#x27;t need to make every point fit, you can find virtually any pattern you want.&quot;

Following the broadcast, Hancock and Bauval complained to the Broadcasting Standards Commission, but the commission found that &quot;the programme makers acted in good faith in their examination of the theories&quot;. One complaint was upheld: that the programme unfairly omitted one of their arguments in rebuttal of astronomer Edwin Krupp. The following year the BBC broadcast a revised version of the episode, &quot;Atlantis Reborn Again&quot;, in which Hancock and Bauval provided further rebuttals to Krupp.

===&quot;The Message of the Sphinx&quot; (1996)===
&quot;The Message of the Sphinx: A Quest for the Hidden Legacy of Mankind&quot; (&quot;Keeper of Genesis&quot; in the United Kingdom) is a pseudoarchaeology book written by Hancock and Robert Bauval in 1996 which argues that the creation of the Sphinx and Pyramids occurred as far back as 10,500 BC using astronomical data. Working from the premise that the Giza pyramid complex encodes a message, the book begins with the fringe Sphinx water erosion hypothesis, evidence that the authors believe suggests that deep erosion patterns on the flanks of the Sphinx were caused by thousands of years of heavy rain. The authors go on to suggest, using computer simulations of the sky, that the pyramids, representing the three stars of Orion&#x27;s Belt, along with associated causeways and alignments, constitute a record in stone of the celestial array at the vernal equinox in 10,500 BC. This moment, they contend, represents Zep Tepi, the &quot;First Time&quot;, often referred to in the hieroglyphic record. They state that the initiation rites of the Egyptian pharaohs replicate on Earth the sun&#x27;s journey through the stars in this remote era, and they suggest that the &quot;Hall of Records&quot; of a lost civilisation may be located by treating the Giza Plateau as a template of these same ancient skies.

=== &quot;Ancient Apocalypse&quot; (2022) ===

Hancock&#x27;s theories are the basis of &quot;Ancient Apocalypse&quot;, a 2022 documentary series produced by Netflix, where Hancock&#x27;s son Sean is &quot;senior manager of unscripted originals&quot;. In the series, Hancock outlines his long-held belief that there was an advanced civilization during the last ice age, that it was destroyed following comet impacts around 12,000 years ago, and that its survivors introduced agriculture, monumental architecture and astronomy to hunter-gatherers around the world. He attempts to show how several ancient monuments and natural features are evidence of this, and repeatedly claims that archaeologists are ignoring or covering-up this alleged evidence.

Archaeologists and other experts say that the series presents pseudoscientific claims that lack evidence, cherry picks, and fails to present the counter-evidence. Other commentators criticized the series for unfounded accusations that &quot;mainstream archaeology&quot; conspires against Hancock&#x27;s ideas. Archaeologists linked Hancock&#x27;s claims to &quot;white supremacist&quot; ideologies from the 19th century, which they say are insulting to the ancestors of indigenous peoples who built the monuments. A Maltese archaeologist who appeared in an episode said her interview had been manipulated. The Society for American Archaeology (SAA) objected to the classification of the series as a documentary and requested that Netflix reclassify it as science fiction. The SAA also stated:
== Other media appearances ==
Hancock gave a TEDx lecture titled &quot;The War on Consciousness&quot;, in which he described his use of ayahuasca, an Amazonian brew containing a hallucinogenic compound DMT, and argued that adults should be allowed to responsibly use it for self-improvement and spiritual growth. He stated that for 24 years he was &quot;pretty much permanently stoned&quot; on cannabis, and that in 2011, six years after his first use of ayahuasca, it enabled him to stop using cannabis. At the recommendation of TED&#x27;s Science Board, the lecture was removed from the TEDx YouTube channel and moved to TED&#x27;s main website where it &quot;can be framed to highlight both [Hancock&#x27;s] provocative ideas and the factual problems with [his] arguments&quot;.

Hancock has appeared on &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; podcast several times. In April 2024 (episode #2136) Hancock debated Flint Dibble, a professor of archeology at Cardiff University, who strongly rebuffed Hancock&#x27;s unfounded ideas, leading even many of Hancock&#x27;s backers to see Dibble – and orthodox science – as the victor. Both Hancock and Dibble agreed that continuing archeological research would be a great benefit to humanity.

==In popular culture==
In 2009, Roland Emmerich released his blockbuster disaster movie &quot;2012&quot;, citing &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot; in the credits as an inspiration for the film, stating: &quot;I always wanted to do a biblical flood movie, but I never felt I had the hook. I first read about the Earth&#x27;s Crust Displacement Theory in Graham Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot;.&quot;

<text>Legends! is a comedic play written by James Kirkwood, Jr. It toured the United States with Mary Martin and Carol Channing in 1986, but never had a production on Broadway. The play concerns two aging rival film stars. Kirkwood wrote about the tour&#x27;s adventures in his memoir &quot;Diary of a Mad Playwright&quot;.

==Production history==

* Mary Martin and Carol Channing U.S. tour: Martin and Channing started the US tour in January 1986 in a Center Theatre Group world premiere production at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, California and ended in Miami, Florida in January 1987, having played more than 300 performances. Although the producers of the show had hoped that it would open on Broadway, that did not happen. Martin left the production when her second-act speech about breast cancer was cut.
* Joan Collins and Linda Evans tour: Joan Collins toured North America with former &quot;Dynasty&quot; co-star Linda Evans. The tour started in September 2006 in Toronto and concluded in New Haven, Connecticut in May 2007 after a 30-week, multi-city tour.
* Lypsinka in New York: John Epperson, better known as Lypsinka has adapted the play for two men in drag, and presented a staged reading on March 23, 2009 in New York City. The reading, which featured Charles Busch, was a benefit for Friends in Deed - The Crisis Center for Life-Threatening Illness. In June 2010, Epperson brought the show to the Studio Theatre in Washington, DC, where he co-starred with James Lecesne.
* Hayley and Juliet Mills Australian tour: &quot;Legends!&quot; made its Australian premiere in 2015 with Hayley Mills and Juliet Mills: The production, which featured Juliet Mills&#x27; husband Maxwell Caulfield, debuted at the QPAC (Brisbane) with a 2–14 June run having previewed from 28 May, subsequently playing a second and final 18 June-5 July engagement at the Theatre Royal (Sydney).

<text>The four-corner method or four-corner system () is a character-input method used for encoding Chinese characters into either a computer or a manual typewriter, using four or five numerical digits per character.

The four digits encode the shapes found in the four corners of the symbol, upper left to lower right. Although this does not uniquely identify a Chinese character, it leaves only a very short list of possibilities. A fifth digit can be added to describe an extra part above the lower right if necessary.

The four-corner method, in its three revisions, was supported by the Chinese state for a while, and is found in numerous older reference works and some still in publication. The small &quot;Kangorin Sino-Japanese Dictionary&quot; by Yoneyama had a four-corner index when it was introduced in the 1980s, but it has since been deleted. However, it is not in common usage today, although dictionaries using it are available. It is identified, in public opinion, with the time when many Chinese were illiterate and the language was not yet unified; more Chinese today use the dictionary to help them write, not read. But it is useful for scholars, clerks, editors, compilers, and especially for foreigners who read Chinese. In recent years it has achieved a new usage as a character input system for computers, generating very short lists to browse.

==Origin==
The four-corner method was invented in the 1920s by Wang Yunwu, the editor in chief at Commercial Press Ltd., China. Its original purpose was to aid telegraphers in looking up Chinese telegraph code numbers in use at that time from long lists of characters. This was mentioned by Wang Yunwu in an introductory pamphlet called &quot;Four-Corner Method&quot;, published in 1926. Cai Yuanpei and Hu Shih wrote introductory essays for this pamphlet.

==Mnemonics==
The four digits used to encode each character are chosen according to the &quot;shape&quot; of the four corners of each character. In order, these corners are upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right. The shapes can be memorized using a poem composed by Hu Shih, called &quot;Bihuahaoma Ge&quot; (), as a &quot;memory key&quot; to the system:

In the 1950s, lexicographers in the People&#x27;s Republic of China changed the poem somewhat in order to avoid association with Hu Shih, who had criticized the Chinese Communist Party, although the contents remain generally unchanged. The 1950s version is as follows:

Several other notes:
* A single stroke can be represented in more than one corner, as is the case with many curly strokes. (e.g. the code for 乙 is 1771)
* If the character is fenced by , (门), or , the lower corners are used to denote what is inside the radical, instead of 00 for 囗 or 22 for the others. (e.g. the code for 回 is 6060)

There have been scores, maybe hundreds, of such numerical and alpha-numerical systems proposed or popularized (such as Lin Yutang&#x27;s &quot;Instant Index&quot;, Trindex, Head-tail, Wang An&#x27;s &quot;Sanjiahaoma&quot;, Halpern); some Chinese refer to these generically as &quot;sijiaohaoma&quot; (after the original pamphlet) though this is not correct.

==Versions==
Over time, the four-corner method has gone through some changes.

===First Version===
The first (revised) version was published in Shanghai in 1928. It was quickly adopted and popularized as a method for (among other things):
* Arranging and indexing Chinese characters in dictionaries
* Indexing Chinese classical and modern books, libraries, hospital and police records
* Chinese typewriters
* Military code making (for handling the characters quickly)

The &quot;Wang Yun-wu Da Cidian&quot; of 1928 was remarkable for its time, and although the pronunciations were very much in line with today&#x27;s Standard Chinese, the lack of a phonetic index diminished its overall usefulness. The northern Mandarin pronunciations were given in Gwoyeu Romatzyh, a romanization system devised by linguist Zhao Yuanren, as well as in Mandarin Phonetic System (MPS or Bopomofo) characters with a dotted corner for tone. It also delineated parts of speech, and all compounds were listed by the four-corner method as well.

The famed lexicographer and editor of &quot;Ciyuan&quot;, Lu Erkui, as well as other lexicographers, became early proponents of the four-corner method. By 1931, it was used extensively by the Commercial Press to index virtually all classical reference works and collections of China, such as the &quot;Pei Wen Yun Fu&quot; and &quot;Complete Library of the Four Treasuries&quot;, as well as many modern ones.

Hospital, personnel and police records were organized just like the biographical indexes and dynastic histories of former times. For a while (Nash, Trindex, 1930), it seemed that use of the 214 Kangxi radicals, introduced during the Qing dynasty, was being replaced by the four-corner method.

Internationally, Harvard and other universities were using the method for their book collections, and the KMT government in Nanjing seemed to have selected this numerical system as its standard. It was taught in primary schools to children in Shanghai and other locations during the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s, up to the outbreak of war with Japan in 1937. The four-corner method was extremely popular in government education circles to promote spoken language unification until pronunciation-based systems became fashionable in the mid-1930s.

The first large-scale project to promote spoken language unification was in 1936: Wang Li&#x27;s 4-volume Mandarin Phonetic System entry, &quot;Guoyu Cidian&quot;. In 1949 it was re-edited into the MPS &quot;Hanyu Da Cidian&quot; with Kangxi radical index, and a small Four Corner dictionary was available as the &quot;Xin Sijiaohaoma Cidian&quot; of 1953. After 1949, limited use of MPS and the original four-corner method continued in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, until the introduction of pinyin in 1958 and after. Today&#x27;s Chinese dictionaries still contain MPS characters below each pinyin class entry and sometimes in a phonetics chart in tables (&quot;Xinhua Cidian&quot;), while main entries are all in Hanyu Pinyin order. There is one all-&quot;sijiaohaoma&quot; small dictionary (Third Revision, below).

===Second Revision===
A minor Second Revision was made during and just after World War II. This was used by most postwar lexicographers including Morohashi Tetsuji, who created his 12-volume Sino-Japanese dictionary, the &quot;Dai Kan-Wa jiten&quot; and included the four-corner index among several other lookup methods. Oshanin included a four-corner index in his Chinese-Russian dictionary and an edition of the &quot;25 Histories&quot; (&quot;Ershiwu shi&quot;) was published in the early 1950s with a four-corner index volume containing the entire content.

Then, in 1958, with the introduction of pinyin, a small &quot;Xin Sijiaohaoma Cidian&quot; was produced by the Beijing Commercial Press, but the rapid Han character simplification of the following years made the small (30,000 compound) book obsolete in China. Overseas and in Hong Kong, it remained popular for a number of years as a high speed key to phonetic dictionaries and indexes. It was used by those partly literate in or unfamiliar with Standard Chinese, especially Hanyu Pinyin.

Wang Yunwu produced a &quot;Xiao Cidian&quot; and &quot;Zonghe Cidian&quot; in the late 1940s; the latter remains in print in Taiwan, with an auxiliary section of rare characters and gives the telecode number, radical and stroke counts for each character.

===Third Revision===
During the Cultural Revolution in mainland China, the four-corner method underwent a radical Third Revision during the compilation of the experimental volume of the &quot;Xiandai Hanyu Cidian&quot;, Commercial Press, Beijing, 1972. Another medium-sized dictionary, the &quot;Xinhua Zidian&quot;, appeared with this index as well, but in the late 1990s the four-corner index disappeared from newer editions. Both works now use only the pinyin main entry and multi-door radical index systems that make it possible to look up a character with perhaps a wrong radical (i.e., characters appear redundantly under different radicals) and the number of strokes and variant forms are greatly reduced, and many more people are literate and capable of transcribing Chinese with pinyin. The use of stroke counting and radicals puts memorization of the character ahead of sheer speed in handling it. This method is more supportive of mass literacy than classical scholarship or processing and filing names or characters for the majority in China today.

The four-corner method is ultimately for readers, researchers, editors and fileclerks, not for writers who seek a character that they know in speech or recitation. In China today, a new version of the excellent small &quot;Xin Sijiaohaoma Cidian&quot;, soft cover from Commercial Press, Beijing, has been available since the late 1970s, updated in several new editions and printings. It also uses the Third Revision.

==Current usage==
The main purpose of the original four-corner system today is in doing academic research or handling large numbers of characters, terms, index cards, or names. It is also used in computer entry, where a smaller list of items is created to browse from than with other systems. The &quot;Xinhua Zidian&quot; large type edition is available with a four-corner index for those whose failing eyesight precludes browsing and counting strokes.

In China today, many famous KMT period reference books and collections with four-corner indexes are being reprinted for sale to scholars and those interested in Old Chinese language or historical studies.

<text>The naxar (, co-spelled &quot;nakhar&quot; or &quot;nahar&quot;) is the currency that Chechen separatists planned for the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.

In 1994, in the UK, banknotes were printed in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 nakhar, dated 1995.

This currency was not put into circulation, and almost all printed banknotes stored in bank of Grozny were destroyed by the Russian military.

The name is derived from the Chechen нахарт (&quot;nakhart&quot;), meaning &quot;small change.&quot;

In probability theory and statistics, the F&quot;-distributionor F&quot;-ratio, also known as Snedecor&#x27;s &quot;F&quot; distribution or the Fisher–Snedecor distribution (after Ronald Fisher and George W. Snedecor), is a continuous probability distribution that arises frequently as the null distribution of a test statistic, most notably in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and other &quot;F&quot;-tests.

==Definitions==
The &quot;F&quot;-distribution with &quot;d&quot;1 and &quot;d&quot;2 degrees of freedom is the distribution of

: formula_9

where formula_10 and formula_11 are independent random variables with chi-square distributions with respective degrees of freedom formula_12 and formula_13.

It can be shown to follow that the probability density function (pdf) for &quot;X&quot; is given by

: formula_14

for real &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0. Here formula_15 is the beta function. In many applications, the parameters &quot;d&quot;1 and &quot;d&quot;2 are positive integers, but the distribution is well-defined for positive real values of these parameters.

The cumulative distribution function is

:formula_16

where &quot;I&quot; is the regularized incomplete beta function.

==Properties==
The expectation, variance, and other details about the F(&quot;d&quot;1, &quot;d&quot;2) are given in the sidebox; for &quot;d&quot;2 &gt; 8, the excess kurtosis is

:formula_17

The &quot;k&quot;-th moment of an F(&quot;d&quot;1, &quot;d&quot;2) distribution exists and is finite only when 2&quot;k&quot; &lt; &quot;d&quot;2 and it is equal to

:formula_18

The &quot;F&quot;-distribution is a particular parametrization of the beta prime distribution, which is also called the beta distribution of the second kind.

The characteristic function is listed incorrectly in many standard references (e.g.,). The correct expression is

:formula_19

where &quot;U&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) is the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind.

==Related distributions==
===Relation to the chi-squared distribution===
In instances where the &quot;F&quot;-distribution is used, for example in the analysis of variance, independence of formula_20 and formula_21 (defined above) might be demonstrated by applying Cochran&#x27;s theorem.

Equivalently, since the chi-squared distribution is the sum of squares of independent standard normal random variables, the random variable of the &quot;F&quot;-distribution may also be written

:formula_22

where formula_23 and formula_24, formula_25 is the sum of squares of formula_26 random variables from normal distribution formula_27 and formula_28 is the sum of squares of formula_29 random variables from normal distribution formula_30.

In a frequentist context, a scaled &quot;F&quot;-distribution therefore gives the probability formula_31, with the &quot;F&quot;-distribution itself, without any scaling, applying where formula_32 is being taken equal to formula_33. This is the context in which the &quot;F&quot;-distribution most generally appears in &quot;F&quot;-tests: where the null hypothesis is that two independent normal variances are equal, and the observed sums of some appropriately selected squares are then examined to see whether their ratio is significantly incompatible with this null hypothesis.

The quantity formula_34 has the same distribution in Bayesian statistics, if an uninformative rescaling-invariant Jeffreys prior is taken for the prior probabilities of formula_32 and formula_33. In this context, a scaled &quot;F&quot;-distribution thus gives the posterior probability formula_37, where the observed sums formula_38 and formula_39 are now taken as known.

===In general===
*If formula_40 and formula_41 (Chi squared distribution) are independent, then formula_42
*If formula_43 (Gamma distribution) are independent, then formula_44
*If formula_45 (Beta distribution) then formula_46
*Equivalently, if formula_47, then formula_48.
*If formula_47, then formula_50 has a beta prime distribution: formula_51.
*If formula_47 then formula_53 has the chi-squared distribution formula_54
*formula_55 is equivalent to the scaled Hotelling&#x27;s T-squared distribution formula_56.
*If formula_47 then formula_58.
*If formula_59 — Student&#x27;s t-distribution — then: formula_60
*&quot;F&quot;-distribution is a special case of type 6 Pearson distribution
*If formula_34 and formula_62 are independent, with formula_63 Laplace(&quot;μ&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) then formula_64
*If formula_65 then formula_66 (Fisher&#x27;s z-distribution)
*The noncentral &quot;F&quot;-distribution simplifies to the &quot;F&quot;-distribution if formula_67.
*The doubly noncentral &quot;F&quot;-distribution simplifies to the &quot;F&quot;-distribution if formula_68
*If formula_69 is the quantile &quot;p&quot; for formula_70 and formula_71 is the quantile formula_72 for formula_73, then formula_74
* &quot;F&quot;-distribution is an instance of ratio distributions
* W-distribution is a unique parametrization of F-distribution.

<text>The Fathers of Confederation are the 36 people who attended at least one of the Charlottetown Conference of 1864 (23 attendees), the Quebec Conference of 1864 (33 attendees), and the London Conference of 1866 (16 attendees), preceding Canadian Confederation. Only eleven people attended all three conferences.

==Table of participation==
The following table lists the participants in the Charlottetown, Quebec, and London Conferences and their attendance at each stage.

==Group photographs and paintings==
==Other possible claimants to title==
Four other individuals have been labelled as Fathers of Confederation. Hewitt Bernard, who was the recording secretary at the Charlottetown Conference, is considered by some to be a Father of Confederation. The leaders most responsible for bringing three specific provinces into Confederation after 1867 are also referred to as Fathers of Confederation.
* The provisional government established by Louis Riel ultimately negotiated the terms under which Manitoba entered Confederation in 1870.
* The leadership of Amor De Cosmos was instrumental both in bringing democracy to British Columbia and in bringing the province into Confederation in 1871.
* The province of Newfoundland entered Confederation in 1949 under the leadership of Joey Smallwood, who was then referred to as the &quot;only living Father of Confederation&quot;.

<doc id="332119" wikidata="Q6635832" url="?curid=332119" title="List of radio stations in Greece">
<text>Greece has over 1,000 radio stations operating with a certificate of temporary legality. Most broadcast on the FM band; the AM band has been almost entirely abandoned by broadcasters, with the exception of State-run media and a few other stations.

In March 2001, the Greek government closed approximately 60 of 90+ FM stations operating in the Athens area, citing potential interference to frequencies to be used by the new Athens International Airport. There are some who believe that the government shut down these stations as a political favor to powerful publishing and media groups, whose stations, for the most part, remained on the air; others argued that the licensing process was legally inconsistent.

The Greek broadcast licensing process came under legal scrutiny as a result, and in 2002, eight of the closed stations reopened. In 2004 and 2005, several more stations reopened as the result of a judicial order. Stations have continued to open since then. Most of them are unlicensed and lack legal permission to broadcast; many of these stations were among those shut down by the Greek government in 2001. Throughout the country, no radio station is operating with a formal license as of March 2019; instead, stations are operating with temporary permits of legality with no expiration date, or simply operate without any legal status whatsoever.

The following is a list of major FM stations in Greece; this list is being upgraded.

==Radio stations in Attica==
Most stations in Athens broadcast from Mount Ymittos to the east of the city (but west of the Athens International Airport in Spata). A smaller minority of stations operate from Mount Parnitha, northwest of the city, or Mount Aigaleo, bordering the west of the city. Many stations also have repeaters on the island of Aegina, south of Athens in the Saronic Sea, to cover coastal regions of Athens, including Glyfada and Vouliagmeni, which due to the topography of the region, cannot receive clear signals from the other locations.

Most stations broadcast in stereo and several employ the Radio Data System technology. Most stations also broadcast with wattage ranging from 2 kW to 15–30 kW; official data on this is not made publicly available. Currently, 44 private radio stations are legally permitted to broadcast in Athens, in addition to the state radio broadcast stations. Focus Bari was chosen as the official company to measure audience listening data and ratings for stations in the Athens region. Previous to that, Focus Bari had been one of several companies tracking audience ratings.

==Radio stations in Thessaloniki==
In the Thessaloniki region a licensing bid for 27 FM frequencies has been on hold for several years, while engineering studies have shown that up to 19 more radio stations could possibly broadcast safely in the region, though how many if any, additional frequencies will be tendered remains uncertain.

Most radio stations in Thessaloniki broadcast from Mount Chortiatis, slightly northeast of the city. A very small minority broadcast from or have repeaters in other points throughout the region. Most stations broadcast in stereo, but a small (but slowly growing) number uses the Radio Data System. Like in Athens, most stations use excessively high wattage. Temporarily, most, but not all, stations are broadcasting with legal &quot;permission&quot; from Greek National Council for Radio and Television, until and if new licenses are issued.

==Medium Wave (MW band)==
On the AM band, there are few licensed stations left, all of which are state-run. Unlicensed broadcasting is tolerated as the majority of listeners have abandoned the MW band. A number of unlicensed radio stations have taken advantage of that, thus avoiding the &quot;crowded&quot; FM band. A number of pirate radio enthusiasts use the expanded upper part of the AM band (1600–1710 kHz) for &quot;experimental&quot; transmissions. When MW pirate radio broadcasting occurred, there was a formal division between the AM and FM, in Athens and Thessaloniki. On the MW/AM band most radio pirates in Athens were broadcasting foreign music (pop and rock) whereas in FM most radio pirates broadcast Greek popular music. In Thessaloniki, and most of the rest of Greece, on MW/AM pirates were playing Greek popular music, and foreign pop and rock on FM. Currently, with several exceptions, nearly all MW/AM radio pirates play Greek popular music to a limited audience.

===In Athens===
All the state-run radio stations still broadcast their programs on the MW band, except the Third Programme which gave its frequency (666 kHz) to an ERA Filia (Friendship) which has been suspended since 2013. The program is shared with another state station Kosmos. Since unlicensed broadcasting on the AM in Greece is illegal but tolerated, some pirate radio stations broadcast full-fledged radio programs, some with commercials and some experimental. An example is on 1098 kHz, broadcasting experimentally in C-QUAM, AM Stereo, one of the few AM Stereo radio stations in Europe. Other unlicensed radio stations on the MW include those on 909 kHz, 1017 kHz, 1035 kHz and 1188 kHz.

===In Thessaloniki===
The two official state-run radio programmes still broadcast their programmes on the MW: the first programme of the Radio Station of Macedonia on 1044 kHz and the second programme on 1179 kHz (simulcasting along with their FM services). A notable unlicensed radio station in Thessaloniki is the 1431AM, a free radio station broadcasting regularly from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki campus in the centre of the city. Other pirate radio stations in the Thessaloniki area are using the 1566 kHz and the AM expanded band (1600–1710).

===The rest of Greece===
State-run ERA radio stations broadcast the ERA International Network programme to the Mediterranean and south-east Europe on 765 kHz (ERT Ioannina), 927 kHz (ERT Zakynthos), 1008 kHz (ERT Corfu), 1260 kHz (ERT Rhodes), 1404 kHz (ERT Komotini) and 1512 kHz (ERT Chania) in Greek. Other regional radio stations still broadcast in AM their programs (ERA National network), such as Kavala and Kozani on the same frequency (1602 kHz) and Heraklion Crete (954 kHz). Numerous pirate stations, many of them high powered, broadcast irregularly throughout Greece. Most are from the central-northern part of the country (Thessaly, West, and Central Macedonia) but there are AM radio pirates in Thrace, Crete, Cyclades and Peloponnese as well. On the AM expanded band (1600–1710) numerous radio pirates transmit experimentally without a regular schedule, or program, mostly Greek popular music along with Q code QSO.

==Digital and Internet Radio==

<doc id="332121" wikidata="Q2278164" url="?curid=332121" title="Wilton, New Hampshire">
<text>Wilton is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 3,896 at the 2020 census. Like many small New England towns, it grew up around water-powered textile mills, but is now a rural bedroom community with some manufacturing and service employment. Wilton is home to the High Mowing School, a private preparatory school.

The main village in town, where 1,324 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Wilton census-designated place and is located near the junction of New Hampshire Routes 31 and 101, at the confluence of Stony Brook with the Souhegan River.

== History ==

The town was first part of a township chartered as &quot;Salem-Canada&quot; in 1735 by Colonial Governor Jonathan Belcher of Massachusetts, which then claimed this area. It was granted to soldiers from Salem, Massachusetts, who had served in 1690 under Sir William Phips in the war against Canada. &quot;Salem-Canada&quot; was one of the towns on the state&#x27;s borders intended to provide protection against Indian attack.

The area was regranted in 1749 by New Hampshire colonial Governor Benning Wentworth as &quot;Number Two&quot;, before being incorporated in 1762 as &quot;Wilton&quot;. It was either named for Wilton in England, or for Sir Joseph Wilton, a famous English sculptor. Sir Wilton&#x27;s coach design for King George III&#x27;s coronation was later used as a model for the Concord coach. The town of Wilton, Maine, would later be named for Wilton, New Hampshire.

The first Sunday school was established in May 1816, and was connected with the Congregational church of which the Rev. Thomas Beede was pastor. It was held in the Centre schoolhouse. Two women, Phebe Abbot, the mother of Prof. Ezra Abbot of Harvard University, and Sarah White Livermore, the hymnist, were leaders in this enterprise. This school was one of the first, if not the first, in the U.S. to be devoted especially and wholly to religious instruction. Seventy children attended the first season. The only book used was the Bible.

The Souhegan River originally provided water power for mills. Today, Wilton is a rural town with orchards, farms and woodlands.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.35%, is water. Wilton is drained by the Souhegan River and its tributaries, Stony Brook and Blood Brook. Via the Souhegan, the entire town is part of the Merrimack River watershed. The town&#x27;s highest point is above sea level, where the east slope of Fisk Hill touches the town&#x27;s western border.

<doc id="332123" wikidata="Q1021395" url="?curid=332123" title="Peterborough, New Hampshire">
<text>Peterborough is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 6,418 at the 2020 census. The main village, with 3,090 people at the 2020 census, is a census-designated place (CDP) and lies along the Contoocook River at the junction of U.S. Route 202 and New Hampshire Route 101. Peterborough is west of Manchester and northwest of Boston.

==History==
Granted by Massachusetts in 1737, it was first permanently settled in 1749. The town suffered several attacks during the French and Indian War. Nevertheless, by 1759, there were fifty families settled. Incorporated on January 17, 1760, by Governor Benning Wentworth, it was named after Lieutenant Peter Prescott (1709–1784) of Concord, Massachusetts, a prominent land speculator.


The Contoocook River and Nubanusit Brook offered numerous sites for watermills, and Peterborough became a prosperous mill town. In 1810, the first cotton factory was established. By 1859, when the population was 2,222, there were four more cotton factories and a woolen mill. Other industries included two paper mills, an iron foundry, a machine shop, a carriage factory, a basket-maker, a maker of trusses and supporters, a boot and shoe factory, seven sawmills, and three gristmills.

The Reverend Abiel Abbot, after being charged with heresy by the Connecticut religious establishment, came to Peterborough as minister to the Peterborough Unitarian Church in 1827. He founded the town&#x27;s first prep school, the Monadnock Summer Lyceum, and the first free library in the US, all in Peterborough.

Peterborough established the first tax-supported free public library in the United States, in 1833. Its success led the New Hampshire State Legislature to pass legislation in 1849 authorizing towns to raise money to establish and maintain their own libraries. The library was in the town&#x27;s general store and post office, and the postmaster served as librarian. The library moved to the town hall in 1873.

Other early cultural institutions include Mariarden, a summer theatre, where Paul Robeson played in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot;. Bette Davis performed there in her teens.

Performance blossomed again in 1976, when Widdie and Jonathon Hall founded the Peterborough Folkway. &quot;Within a few years, it became a &#x27;must play&#x27; on the East Coast for folk musicians&quot;; it remained popular for two decades. Regular performers included Tom Paxton, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Shawn Colvin, and Suzanne Vega.

In the 1980s, thanks to publisher Wayne Green, &quot;Peterborough was clearly the per capita magazine production capital of the world.&quot; Over 100 magazines, mostly about computers and technology, were published there; these included &quot;Byte&quot; and &quot;MacComputing&quot;.

Peterborough&#x27;s leadership in environmental protection began in the 1990s, when its Earth Day USA office supported the United States Air Force&#x27;s annual Earth Day events around the world.

==Geography==
The town is , of which are land and (1.06%) are water. Peterborough is drained by the Contoocook River and its tributaries, Nubanusit Brook and Otter Brook. The entire town is part of the Merrimack River watershed. The highest point in Peterborough as well as in Hillsborough County is the summit of South Pack Monadnock ( above sea level), in Miller State Park in the southeast corner of town. Peterborough is also home to Edward MacDowell Dam and Lake recreation area, where visitors can walk across the dam, hike, cross-country ski, swim, boat, picnic, play Frisbee golf, play horseshoes, and take advantage of other recreational opportunities, many of them accessible to people with disabilities. The town is crossed by U.S. Route 202 and Route 101.

==Demographics==


As of the 2010 United States census, there were 6,284 people, 2,713 households, and 1,629 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 2,956 housing units at an average density of .

<text>Hudson is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. It is located along the Massachusetts state line. The population was 25,394 at the 2020 census. It is the tenth-largest municipality (town or city) in the state, by population.

The urban center of town, where 7,534 people resided as of the 2020 census, is defined as the Hudson census-designated place (CDP) and is located at the junctions of New Hampshire routes 102, 111 and 3A, directly across the Merrimack River from the city of Nashua.

== History ==
Hudson began as part of the Dunstable Land Grant that encompassed the current city of Nashua, New Hampshire, and the towns of Dunstable and Pepperell, Massachusetts, as well as parts of other nearby towns on both sides of the border. In 1732, all of Dunstable east of the Merrimack River became the town of Nottingham, Massachusetts. Nine years later, the northern boundary of Massachusetts was finally officially established, and the New Hampshire portion of Nottingham became Nottingham West, to avoid confusion with Nottingham, New Hampshire, to the northeast.

In 1830, after the better part of a century, the name was changed to &quot;Hudson&quot; to avoid confusion with the older town of Nottingham. The name apparently comes from an early belief that the Merrimack River had once been thought to be a tributary of the Hudson River, or that the area had once been explored by Henry Hudson; both proved to be entirely apocryphal stories, but the name of the town remains today.

A prominent family in Hudson history was the Alfred and Virginia Hills family, who owned a large tract of land north of Hudson Village. Dr. Hills&#x27; ancestors were original settlers of Hudson. The Hills House on Derry Road (now listed on the National Register of Historic Places) is the original family&#x27;s vacation home and current location of the Hudson Historical Society. The grounds host the annual &quot;Old Home Days&quot; fair every year as well as &quot;Harvest Fest&quot; and the &quot;Bronco Belly Bustin&#x27; Chili Fiesta&quot;, an Alvirne High School Friends of Music fundraiser. Hills Memorial Library (also listed on the National Register) is one of the oldest public lending libraries in the state, and occupies a stone and mortar building on Library Street.

Alvirne High School and the Alvirne Chapel, located on family land across Derry Road from the Hills House, were donated to the town. (&quot;Alvirne&quot; is a contraction of &quot;Alfred&quot; and &quot;Virginia&quot;.) A strange rumor that the Hills&#x27; only son had died during a football game circled for many years, but Dr. and Mrs. Hills only had two daughters who did not survive infancy, so this was a made-up story. Out of respect, Alvirne High went many decades without a football team, despite being one of the largest high schools in the state. It was assumed that such a stipulation had been put as a condition of the high school&#x27;s charter. When it was learned that no such condition had ever been recorded, financial pressures encouraged the formation of a football team. In fall of 1994, Alvirne High School fielded its first JV football team, with varsity play beginning in 1996. Alvirne High is home to one of the largest agricultural-vocational programs in the area, the Wilbur H. Palmer Agricultural and Vocational School. This school features several student-run businesses including a bank, restaurant, store, day care, dairy farm, and forestry program.

== Geography ==
Hudson is located in southeastern Hillsborough County along the southern edge of New Hampshire, with its southern boundary forming the Massachusetts state line. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 3.35% of the town.

The highest point in Hudson is Bush Hill, at above sea level, near the town&#x27;s eastern border. Hudson lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed.
The town of Hudson had two historic centers, though modern development and suburban sprawl have obscured the difference. Hudson Village, roughly equivalent to the Hudson census-designated place, is located at the western edge of town on the Merrimack River near the junctions of Routes 3A, 111, and 102, and was home to most of the original schools, libraries, and town government, though many of these functions have moved to new facilities elsewhere in town. The Town Hall still remains, though the main police station has moved to the eastern edge of town into an industrial park off Route 111. The Hills Memorial Library building remains as a historic landmark, though its collection has been moved to a new building, the Rodgers Memorial Library, located on Route 102 in the northeastern part of town. The historic Kimball Webster School no longer holds classes, but today houses the town superintendent&#x27;s office, though both the Library Street School and the H.O. Smith School are still active. The Town Common at the intersection of Derry, Ferry, and Library streets is a park that displays large toy soldiers and other decorations at Christmas time.

Hudson Center, historically Hudson&#x27;s other town center, is located at the five-way intersection of Central Street (Route 111), Greeley Street, Kimball Hill Road, and Windham Road near the geographic center of the town. The two most important landmarks of Hudson Center have been lost to history. Benson&#x27;s Wild Animal Farm, a zoo and amusement park, was closed in the late 1980s due to mounting financial losses. At one time there was a railway that passed through the Center, taking passengers all the way from the Boston area to Benson&#x27;s. A rail depot stand remained on nearby Greeley Street through the 1970s. The acreage of Benson&#x27;s Wild Animal Farm was purchased by the town and is now a park for passive recreation. Greeley Field, a popular park located in Hudson Center, contains a playground, Little League baseball diamond, and basketball courts, where pick-up games still occur frequently. A Revolutionary War-era cemetery and an old school house (now housing) on Kimball Hill Road are located nearby.

Hudson serves primarily as a bedroom community for the Greater Boston metropolitan area, of which it is a part. In 2006, for example, there were an estimated 10,945 jobs in the public and private sector in Hudson, while the town&#x27;s population was 24,729, with a civilian labor force of 14,818. The town&#x27;s three largest employers are Benchmark Electronics, BAE Systems, and the Hudson School District. Presstek is also headquartered in Hudson.

== Transportation ==
Three New Hampshire state routes traverse the town:

*NH 3A is the main north-south route through town. It enters the town at the Massachusetts border following River Road. It then follows Lowell Road, Central Street, Chase Street, Derry Street, Elm Avenue, and Webster Street to the town&#x27;s northern border with Litchfield. 3A shares a concurrency with NH 102 along Derry Street.
*NH 102 begins at the Taylor Falls/Veterans Memorial twin span bridge over the Merrimack River, and after a brief concurrency with NH 111, joins NH 3A for a concurrency along Derry Street. After 3A leaves Derry Street, 102 continues along it to the northeast passing through a small portion of Litchfield, then returning into Hudson briefly before crossing into Londonderry.
*NH 111 enters the town at the Taylor Falls/Veterans Memorial bridge from Nashua and has a brief concurrency with NH 102. 111 follows Ferry Street, Burnham Road, and Central Street as the main east-west route across town. It leaves at the town&#x27;s eastern edge entering the town of Windham.

In addition to the three numbered state highways, about half of a two-mile section of the as-yet uncompleted Circumferential Highway also exists in Hudson. The road currently serves to connect Hudson to the Everett Turnpike in Nashua, using the Sagamore Bridge across the Merrimack River.

The nearest airports are Boire Field in Nashua and Manchester–Boston Regional Airport along the border of Londonderry and Manchester. The nearest rail service is the Lowell Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail which can be accessed at the Charles A. Gallagher Transit Terminal in Lowell, Massachusetts. The nearest Amtrak stations are Boston&#x27;s North Station or South Station. The nearest intercity bus depot is at the Nashua Transit Center in Nashua. Hudson currently has no public transportation in the town; though a street trolley formerly ran through the town connecting it to neighboring communities.

== Sites of interest ==
Two small recreational lakes exist within the town borders. Robinson (or Robinson&#x27;s) Pond in the northern part of the town features a public access beach and boat ramp that can be accessed via Robinson Road. Otternic Pond (locally called &quot;Tonic Pond&quot;), located between Hudson Center and Hudson Village, has a public boat landing (Claveau Landing) that can be accessed off Highland Street. Both ponds are often used for fishing during the summer and skating and ice hockey during the winter. Musquash Pond (or Swamp), located in the southern part of the town, is a wild bird sanctuary and is utilized as a breeding ground by several threatened and endangered species of birds. In the early 1900s hunters would travel by horse from as far as Derry to camp and stalk game in the renowned swamp.

Benson&#x27;s Wild Animal Farm reopened in May 2010 as Benson Park, a town park for recreational use. The park includes trails for walking, biking and hiking, several ponds, wildlife blinds, picnic areas, a children&#x27;s playground, dog parks and a park store. There is no admission fee. Much work has been done and is ongoing to rehabilitate and maintain the park&#x27;s trails, gardens, landscaping, and remaining buildings. The Old Lady in the Shoe, the gorilla house, the elephant barn, the A-Frame roof and other structures including the train stop building have been repaired. Cage concerts are held in the elephant barn cage. An official grand opening and re-dedication was held September 2010. The park is home to the largest 9/11 memorial in the state.

Hills Memorial Library, located in Hudson Village, was one of the oldest public lending libraries in the state before its closing in 2009, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. While no longer open to the public, the building remains a prominent landmark in Hudson Village.

Two public golf courses exist in Hudson, the Whip-Poor-Will Golf Club off Route 102 and the Green Meadow Golf Club on Steele Road (off Route 3A/Lowell Road).

A 1/4-mile paved racetrack, the Hudson Speedway, lies near the northern edge of town by the intersection of Old Derry Road and Robinson Road. It can be accessed off Route 102. It hosts races from the NASCAR Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series.

<doc id="332131" wikidata="Q2185242" url="?curid=332131" title="Corporatization">
<text>Corporatization is the process of transforming and restructuring state assets, government agencies, public organizations, or municipal organizations into corporations. It involves the adoption and application of business management practices and the separation of ownership from management through the creation of a joint-stock or shareholding structure for the organization. The result of corporatization is the creation of state-owned corporations (or corporations at other government levels, such as municipally owned corporations) where the government retains a majority ownership of the corporation&#x27;s stock. Corporatization is undertaken to improve efficiency of an organization, to commercialize its operations, to introduce corporate and business management techniques to public functions, or as a precursor to partial or full privatization.

==History==
The move towards neoliberal economic reform and New Public Management public service reform in the 1980s led to privatization of public functions in many countries. Corporatization was seen as a half-way house on the road to privatization. These state-owned enterprises are organized in the same manner as private corporations, with the difference that the company&#x27;s shares remain in the ownership of the state and are not traded on the stock market. Corporatization is today often seen as an end in itself in order to introduce autonomy in organizations, hoping that this brings efficiency gains.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China implemented a large scale restructuring of state enterprises starting in the economic reforms initiated in 1978, where state enterprises were granted greater autonomy in their operations from economy-wide state planning. This culminated in a massive wave of corporatization between 1992 and 2002 with the adoption of a market economy and the opening of the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges. Corporatization involved restructuring state enterprises to operate as commercial and market entities while retaining state ownership or majority state ownership.

Some argue that the trend towards corporatization has sped up due to the financial crisis, although there is evidence that there has been a trend towards corporatization since at least the start of the century.

== Reasons and effects ==
Corporatization can be used to improve efficiency of public service delivery (with mixed successes), as a step towards (partial) privatization, or to alleviate fiscal stress.

=== (Potentially) improving efficiency ===
A key purpose of corporatization is externalization. The effect of corporatization has been to convert state departments (or municipal services) into public companies and interpose commercial boards of directors between the shareholding ministers / city council and the management of the enterprises. Such externalization creates legal and managerial autonomy from politicians, which could potentially increase efficiency, as it safeguards the firm from political exploitation. However, corporatization can also fail to bring efficiency (or cause inefficiency), because this autonomy reduces the government&#x27;s ability to monitor its management. Whether corporatization is beneficial may depend on the nature of the service that is corporatized, where autonomy may be less beneficial for more politicized and complex services.

=== Step towards privatization or hybridization ===
Although corporatization is to be distinguished from privatization (the former involves publicly owned corporations, the latter privately owned ones), once a service has been corporatised it is often relatively easy to privatise or part-privatise it, for example by selling some or all of the company&#x27;s shares via the stock market. In some cases (e.g. the Netherlands in regard to water supply) there are laws to prevent this. Corporatization also can be a step towards the creation of hybrid forms of organization, such as institutional public-private partnerships or inter-municipal service organizations.

=== Alleviate fiscal stress ===
Corporatization is also a means to alleviate fiscal stress, as corporations can become standalone organizations that do not count towards municipalities&#x27; budgets.

== Prevalence ==
Corporatization of state enterprises and collectively owned enterprises was a major component of the economic restructuring program of formerly communist nations, most notably the People&#x27;s Republic of China. China&#x27;s contemporary socialist market economy is based on a corporatized state sector where state companies are owned by the central government but managed in a semi-autonomous fashion. Corporatization has also been used in New Zealand and most states of Australia in the reform of their electricity markets, as well as in many other countries and industries (e.g. Dutch water supply companies).

==Major areas==
=== National level ===
On a national scale, major areas of services which have been corporatized in the past include:
* National railroads, the initial impetus to corporatization of functions that had belonged to national and local governing bodies began in the sphere of national railroad construction in the mid-19th century.
* Corporatized highways, for example toll roads.
* Corporatized electricity
* Telecommunications

=== Local level ===

On a local scale, major areas of services which have been corporatized include:
* Corporatized water, for example, the Dutch water supply companies are publicly owned corporations (mostly by municipalities, but also by regional governments). For involvement of private corporations in water supply, see water industry and water privatization.
* Bus services
* Refuse collection
*Housing development
*State employment services
*Theaters and cultural institutions

<text>William Fagerbakke ( ; born October 4, 1957) is an American actor. He voices Patrick Star in the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; franchise, and played Michael &quot;Dauber&quot; Dybinski on the sitcom &quot;Coach&quot;. He also appeared in 12 episodes of the sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; as Marshall Eriksen&#x27;s father Marvin.

==Early life and education==
Bill Fagerbakke was born on October 4, 1957, in Fontana, California, and moved to Rupert, Idaho, as a youth. He graduated from Minico High School in Rupert in 1975, where he was a three-sport athlete for the Spartans in football, basketball, and track.

Although he had multiple scholarship offers for college football, including Pac-8 schools, Fagerbakke decided to stay in state and attended the University of Idaho in Moscow. He was a defensive lineman for the Vandals and was ticketed to redshirt in 1976, but was called into action in the fourth game of his sophomore season. The Vandals went 7–4 in 1976, their first winning season in five years, and were 5–2 in the seven games that Fagerbakke started. Head coach Ed Troxel planned on moving him to the offensive line in 1977, but a knee injury in spring drills ended Fagerbakke&#x27;s athletic career, which turned his focus to theater.

Fagerbakke&#x27;s first theatrical role was in a campus production of &quot;Godspell&quot;. He was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity and earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1981, a result of &quot;two years of football and four years of school.&quot; He later attended graduate school at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas.

==Career==

Fagerbakke has appeared on television in roles such as assistant coach &quot;Dauber&quot; Dybinski on &quot;Coach&quot;, and in films, including &quot;Funny Farm&quot;. He had a role as the mentally disabled Tom Cullen in the 1994 mini-series &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s The Stand&quot;. In 1999, he had a role in HBO&#x27;s original series &quot;Oz&quot; as Officer Karl Metzger. Since 1999, he has provided the voice of Patrick Star for the Nicktoon &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. His character on &quot;Coach&quot; was based on a former assistant coach at Idaho, a graduate assistant nicknamed &quot;Tuna.&quot;

In 2007, he made a cameo appearance on the show &quot;Heroes&quot; as Steve Gustavson in the episodes &quot;Run&quot; and &quot;Unexpected.&quot; In 2009, he had a role in the film &quot;Jennifer&#x27;s Body&quot;. He also played the role of Marvin Eriksen Sr. in the CBS sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;. In 2012, he made a cameo appearance in the TV show &quot;Weeds&quot;.

In 2022, Fagerbakke guest-starred in the fifth season of &quot;Dynasty&quot; as Peter de Viblis. His daughter Carson portrays Peter&#x27;s daughter Patty.

==Personal life==
In 1989, Fagerbakke married actress Catherine McClenahan, with whom he had two daughters, one of which is actress Carson Fagerbakke. In September 2012, he filed for legal separation from McClenahan, citing irreconcilable differences.

<doc id="332137" wikidata="Q2481593" url="?curid=332137" title="The Aeroplane Flies High">
<text>The Aeroplane Flies High is a five-disc box set released by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins in 1996. It contains expanded versions of the five singles from their album &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; and also included a 44-page booklet with pictures and writings by the band&#x27;s lead singer Billy Corgan, as well as lyrics. A limited edition release, the box reached number 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Originally intended to be limited to 200,000 copies, Virgin Records produced more after the original run sold out due to overwhelming and unexpected demand. The album was remastered in 2013 under the supervision of frontman Billy Corgan and reissued on vinyl and as a CD/DVD box set.

== Reception ==

According to Tom Moon, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;&quot;Aeroplane&quot; is the Pumpkins’ &quot;Anthology 1&quot;, a cutting-room-floor companion piece to &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; that provides insight into Corgan&#x27;s extraordinary creative outbursts. He has said that &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; was a transforming experience for the band, and &quot;Aeroplane&quot; shows how much the Pumpkins are still willing to take chances. And here&#x27;s the scary part: There is no filler here. These supposedly second-string tracks are keepers. &quot;Aeroplane&quot; has its indulgent moments; the very exercise of anthologizing this material is megalomaniacal. But the ballads are as gorgeous as anything Corgan has ever written. The box also has small, ruminative pieces that are jarringly thoughtful and blasts of guitar riffage straight outta the corporate-rock ’70s.&quot;

== Deluxe release ==

In 2013, the Smashing Pumpkins issued a 6-disc deluxe version of &quot;The Aeroplane Flies High&quot;. According to Ian Cohen, writing for Pitchfork, &quot;[t]he Aeroplane Flies High is not a beloved obscurity, nor is it a canonical album celebrating a milestone anniversary. It’s not even an album: it’s a widely available, 16-year old collection of B-sides from a double album. Granted, the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness was more judiciously edited than the title would lead you to believe. It was a 28-song double album all the same, and now Aeroplane nearly quadruples in size with 90 additional tracks on top of its original 33, with a bonus DVD to boot.&quot;

== Track listing ==

The &quot;Pastichio Medley&quot; is a medley of riffs from a variety of sources recorded after &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; and before the completion of &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;. It features &quot;The Demon&quot;, &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;, &quot;Dearth&quot;, &quot;Knuckles&quot;, &quot;Star Song&quot;, &quot;Firepower&quot;, &quot;New Waver&quot;, &quot;Space Jam&quot;, &quot;Zoom&quot;, &quot;So Very Sad About Us&quot;, &quot;Phang&quot;, &quot;Speed Racer&quot;, &quot;The Eternal E&quot;, &quot;Hairy Eyeball&quot;, &quot;The Groover&quot;, &quot;Hell Bent for Hell&quot;, &quot;Rachel&quot;, &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, &quot;Blast&quot;, &quot;The Black Rider&quot;, &quot;Slurpee&quot;, &quot;Flipper&quot;, &quot;The Viper&quot;, &quot;Bitch&quot;, &quot;Fried&quot;, &quot;Harmonio&quot;, &quot;U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;The Tracer&quot;, &quot;Envelope Woman&quot;, &quot;Plastic Guy&quot;, &quot;Glasgow 3am&quot;, &quot;The Road Is Long&quot;, &quot;Funkified&quot;, &quot;Rigamarole&quot;, &quot;Depresso&quot;, &quot;The Streets Are Hot Tonite&quot;, &quot;Dawn at 16&quot;, &quot;Spazmatazz&quot;, &quot;Fucker&quot;, &quot;In the Arms of Sheep&quot;, &quot;Speed&quot;, &quot;77&quot;, &quot;Me Rock You Snow&quot;, &quot;Feelium&quot;, &quot;Is Alex Milton&quot;, &quot;Rubberman&quot;, &quot;Spacer&quot;, &quot;Rock Me&quot;, &quot;Weeping Willowly&quot;, &quot;Rings&quot;, &quot;So So Pretty&quot;, &quot;Lucky Lad&quot;, &quot;Jackboot&quot;, &quot;Milieu&quot;, &quot;Disconnected&quot;, &quot;Let Your Lazer Love Light Shine Down&quot;, &quot;Phreak&quot;, &quot;Porkbelly&quot;, &quot;Robot Lover&quot;, &quot;Jimmy James&quot;, &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Slinkeepie&quot;, &quot;Dummy Tum Tummy&quot;, &quot;Fakir&quot;, &quot;Jake&quot;, &quot;Camaro&quot;, &quot;Moonkids&quot;, &quot;Make It Fungus&quot;, &quot;V-8&quot;, and &quot;Die&quot;.

&quot;Rachel&quot; bears a similar sound to, and is apparently an early version of, the &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; song &quot;X.Y.U.&quot;.

<text>Jeffrey Nye Mangum (born 24 October 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician who gained prominence as the founder, songwriter, vocalist and guitarist of Neutral Milk Hotel, as well for his co-founding of The Elephant 6 Recording Company. Mangum is characterized for his complex, lyrically dense songwriting, exemplified on the critically lauded album &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,&quot; as well as for his public image as a recluse associated with his extended periods of musical inactivity and minimal press interaction. An article published in &quot;Slate&quot; described Mangum as the &quot;Salinger of Indie Rock.&quot; In 2023, Jeff Mangum received a Grammy award nomination for &quot;Best Boxed Or Special Limited Edition Package&quot;.

==Recording career==

===Early life===
Mangum was born in Ruston, Louisiana, where he met the other co-founding members of Elephant 6, Robert Schneider, Will Cullen Hart, and Bill Doss. Mangum&#x27;s father, James Mangum, was a professor of economics at Louisiana Tech University. As teenagers, the boys shared a passion for home recording, influenced by the likes of the Minutemen, John Cage, and 1960s psychedelia. Mangum&#x27;s earliest musical projects included Maggot (a punk group with Will Hart), Cranberry Lifecycle (an experimental pop project, also with Hart) and Synthetic Flying Machine (which featured Bill Doss). In the early 1990s Mangum, Hart and Doss moved from Ruston to Athens, Georgia and Synthetic Flying Machine evolved into Olivia Tremor Control, led primarily by Hart and Doss. Mangum has contributed vocals, drums and sound effects to many of the Olivia&#x27;s subsequent recordings, including their debut EP &quot;California Demise&quot;, released in 1994 on the Elephant 6 Recording Co. imprint.

===Neutral Milk Hotel===
Mangum left Athens and travelled around the United States, working on solo four-track tape recordings under the name Milk, which would soon become Neutral Milk Hotel. The earliest Neutral Milk Hotel releases included the Elephant 6 cassette &quot;Hype City Soundtrack&quot;, and &quot;Everything Is&quot;, a 7&quot; released by Cher Doll Records. Mangum recorded his debut LP &quot;On Avery Island&quot; at Robert Schneider&#x27;s Pet Sounds Studio in Denver, Colorado between 1994 and 1995. The album was released in 1996 on Merge Records in North America and Fire Records in the UK. Following the album&#x27;s release, Mangum expanded Neutral Milk Hotel to include his friends Scott Spillane, Julian Koster and Jeremy Barnes. The group returned to Denver in 1997 to record &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;, which was released the following year and would become one of the most highly acclaimed indie rock albums of all time.

===After Neutral Milk Hotel===
Mangum disbanded Neutral Milk Hotel following an extensive tour of North America and Europe, culminating in a solo set on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1998 at the 40 Watt Club in Athens. Allegedly suffering from poor health and a nervous breakdown, Mangum made few public appearances until February 2001, when he performed a one-off show in New Zealand at the request of Chris Knox. That summer, Mangum released a compilation of field recordings of Bulgarian folk music on the Orange Twin label titled &quot;Orange Twin Field Works: Volume I&quot;. This was followed by a live solo album &quot;Live at Jittery Joe&#x27;s&quot;, recorded by filmmaker Lance Bangs in 1997. In the fall of 2001 he joined Circulatory System and The Instruments on an East Coast tour, providing drums and vocals. While working with the people involved in the Major Organ and the Adding Machine act, a short film by the same name was curated. Mangum contributed to the soundtrack (which is a modified version of the album by the same name) as well as playing several very minor roles in the film.

In February 2002, Mangum was interviewed by Pitchfork where he discussed his emotional response to &quot;In The Aeroplane Over The Sea&quot;, his recent interest in Buddhism and Eastern thought, travelling across Europe, and working on new field recordings and sound collage pieces (under the name Korena Pang). He also expressed doubt that he would record another Neutral Milk Hotel album, &quot;I just feel like these windows open up for something to be honest, and they don&#x27;t stay open for very long. I guess my path feels sort of different now&quot;.

In the summer and fall of 2002, Mangum hosted several shows on the free-form New Jersey radio station WFMU. His playlists included excerpts from music therapy classes, &quot;musique concrète&quot; pieces, European folk music, and environmental recordings by Chris Watson. He also played a two-hour drone piece by Tony Conrad, and the entirety of &quot;Live at the Village Vanguard Again!&quot; by John Coltrane and &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; by Robert Wyatt. Mangum also debuted a lengthy new sound collage work, entitled &quot;To Animate the Body with the Cocoon of the Her Unconscious Christ the Mother Removes Her Death Body of 1910 Only To Be Reborn in the Same Spirit as a School of Blow Fish Believing in the Coming of the Milk Christ&quot;, and credited to The Long Warm Wall of Alfred Snouts.

Mangum regularly contributed vocals, drums and sound effects to a number of Elephant 6-related albums throughout the 2000s. These included &quot;Curse Of The Seven Jackals&quot; (with Laura Carter, Eric Harris, Chris Jolly &amp; Heather McIntosh), &quot;Major Organ and the Adding Machine&quot; (with Julian Koster, Kevin Barnes and Will Hart, amongst others), Circulatory System&#x27;s self-titled debut, &quot;Signal Morning&quot; and &quot;Mosaics Within Mosaics&quot;, the Apples in Stereo&#x27;s &quot;New Magnetic Wonder&quot;, the Music Tapes&#x27; &quot;Mary&#x27;s Voice&quot; and Jeremy Barnes&#x27; &quot;A Hawk and a Hacksaw&quot;.

===Return to live performances===
 In August 2005, Mangum appeared onstage with the Olivia Tremor Control at New York City&#x27;s Bowery Ballroom to sing &quot;I Have Been Floated&quot;. He made no further public appearances until October 2008, when he took part in the Elephant 6 Holiday Surprise reunion tour, performing the Neutral Milk Hotel song &quot;Engine&quot; at several shows accompanied by Julian Koster on singing saw.

In December 2009, Mangum contributed a cover of &quot;Sign the Dotted Line&quot; to a Chris Knox tribute album titled &quot;&quot;. This was followed by an appearance at a Knox benefit show on May 6, 2010 at Le Poisson Rouge, where Mangum performed a number of acoustic Neutral Milk Hotel songs. On December 4, 2010, Mangum played an unannounced set at a loft in Bushwick, Brooklyn.

On April 20, 2011, Robert Schneider debuted a score composed by Mangum for the Teletron, a mind-controlled electronic instrument invented by Schneider. In August 2011, Mangum launched the website Walking Wall of Words, through which he self-released a vinyl box set of Neutral Milk Hotel recordings and previously unreleased material. He also curated a series of downloadable &#x27;radio broadcasts&#x27; and sold one-of-a-kind drawings, with a portion of proceeds donated to charities including Children of the Blue Sky.

Also in August, Mangum commenced a tour of the East Coast, performing mainly Neutral Milk Hotel songs. On September 30, he played a full set at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in Asbury Park, NJ. On October 4, he made an appearance at Zuccotti Park in New York City and played several songs to those participating in the Occupy Wall Street protests. In March 2012, he curated the ATP festival in Minehead, England, inviting a number of Elephant 6 groups including The Apples In Stereo, The Music Tapes, Olivia Tremor Control and A Hawk and a Hacksaw. Influential artists such as The Fall, Thurston Moore, Roscoe Mitchell and the Sun Ra Arkestra also performed at the three-day event.

Mangum&#x27;s solo tour continued throughout 2012 and into 2013, including high-profile appearances at Coachella, Primavera Sound, and the Calgary Folk Music Festival. He was often accompanied by friends and former Neutral Milk Hotel bandmates Koster, Spillane and Barnes onstage. On October 11, 2013, Neutral Milk Hotel performed their first full show in fifteen years at a former Methodist church in Baltimore, MD. An extensive reunion tour was announced for late 2013 through 2014, including shows in Taiwan, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and throughout North America and Europe. The band&#x27;s final show of 2014 took place at Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin, TX, on November 9.

In April 2015, Neutral Milk Hotel embarked upon their &quot;last tour for the foreseeable future&quot; including dates with Dot Wiggin and Circulatory System. Their final show took place at the Phoenix Theater, Petaluma, CA on June 11.

===As Korena Pang===
Korena Pang was a name used by Jeff Mangum for his sound collage work, which he debuted during his 2002 show on New Jersey radio station WFMU. The name first appeared in the liner notes to the 1996 Neutral Milk Hotel album &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, and has been used interchangeably with another pseudonym, Alfred Snouts. Mangum described the process of constructing sound collage pieces during a rare interview with Pitchfork the same year:
&quot;I made a record of montage sounds in &#x27;99 under the name Korena Pang, but it was never put out because it didn&#x27;t do it for me [...] That record was more just a collection of twenty different home recordings, whereas the montage work I&#x27;m doing now is like a thousand sounds in one minute. Now I&#x27;m able to go out into the world with my field recorder, record sounds, and bring them home to collage on the computer. The raw sounds can really move and come alive that way. I love the idea of a record containing an entire universe; where the sounds span decades of recording from all over the world and all sorts of different sources.&quot;

==Personal life==
In January 2008, it was reported that Mangum had married filmmaker and activist Astra Taylor. Taylor joined Mangum onstage for a number of shows in 2013 and 2014, playing guitar and accordion.

Mangum is vegan, and on October 27, 2011, performed a benefit show at the Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary, raising over $16,500.

In September 2019, Mangum and Taylor attended the New York City Climate Strike.

In March 2020, ahead of the US presidential election, Mangum endorsed the presidential campaign of US Senator Bernie Sanders in a message to &quot;his friends&quot; (fans of the band), subsequently shared publicly and co-signed by Taylor.

<doc id="332152" wikidata="Q548187" url="?curid=332152" title="Count of Holland">
<text>The counts of Holland ruled over the County of Holland in the Low Countries between the 10th and the 16th century.

==The Frisian origins==
While the Frisian kingdom had comprised most of the present day Netherlands, the later province of Friesland in the Netherlands was much reduced. Already in the early Middle Ages West-Frisia (Frisia west of the Vlie) was not considered to be a part of Frisia anymore, and came to be known as Holland (present day provinces North and South Holland and Zeeland). Floris II was the first count who restyled his name from count of &quot;West-Frisia&quot;, in count of &quot;Holland&quot;.

Frisia Proper in medieval time therefore only included the middle and eastern part. The middle part (corresponding to the present day Dutch province of Friesland) was populated by free peasants who successfully resisted all attempts by feudal lords to subdue them, mainly the counts of Holland and the bishops of Utrecht. In the eastern part, local chieftains created their own states (within the Holy Roman Empire) in the late Middle Ages. They became a county after 1446 until 1744, after which it was incorporated within Prussia and later Germany.

==House of Holland==

The first count of Holland, Dirk I, was the son or foster-son of Gerolf, Count in Frisia (Dijkstra suggests that Dirk may have been the son of a sister of Gerolf and that his own father died while he was still an infant). He received land around Egmond from Charles the Fat at a place called Bladella (modern-day Bladel near Eindhoven, The Netherlands) in 922. This is seen as the beginning of the county of Holland. However, until about 1100, the usual names for the county were West-Friesland, Frisia or Kennemerland; in spite of this the counts from Dirk I onwards are traditionally named &quot;of Holland&quot;.

Note that the chronology of the first few counts is uncertain. The existence of a count between Dirk I and Dirk II was only recently suggested, since it is thought that the references to counts named Dirk between 896 and 988 refer to three, not two, different counts. This third Count Dirk is placed between Dirk I and II and numbered as Dirk I &quot;bis&quot; to avoid confusion with the already established numbering referring to the other counts of Holland named Dirk.

The counts of West-Frisia ruled locally in the name of the archbishop of Utrecht, but over time, the counts of Holland came to dominate the bishopric of Utrecht. The archbishop of Utrecht governed the area on behalf of the Holy Roman Emperor, who saw his power diminished by the feudal system in which the counts and dukes ruled almost as sovereigns.

The counts of Holland tried frequently to increase their territory but apart from the acquisition of Zeeland during the 14th century they had no lasting success. Instead, it became a part of the mighty medieval dynasties&#x27; possessions, first Wittelsbach then Valois and thereafter Habsburg.


==House of Avesnes==
==House of Wittelsbach==
There was a war of succession between uncle (John III, Duke of Bavaria) and niece (Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut). This war was finally won by Philip the Good in 1433, who, in the meantime had inherited John&#x27;s claims on the county. Philip and Jacqueline were double first cousins, Philip&#x27;s mother is daughter of Albert while Jacqueline&#x27;s mother was daughter of Philip the Bold of Burgundy. In April 1433 he forced Jacqueline to abdicate from Hainaut and Holland on his behalf.

==House of Valois-Burgundy==
==House of Habsburg==

*Maximilian (r. 1482–1494, regent), Holy Roman Emperor, &quot;husband of Mary I&quot;
*Philip II &quot;the Handsome&quot; (r. 1494–1506), King Philip I of Castile
*Charles II (r. 1515–1555), Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, King of Spain
*Philip III (r. 1555–1581, 1581–1598 titular only), King Philip II of Spain

During the &#x27;foreign rule&#x27; by Burgundy and Habsburg, the county was governed by a stadtholder in name of the count. In 1581, the Estates General of the United Provinces declared themselves independent from the Spanish rule of Philip II (who was Philip III of Holland). Until the Treaty of Münster in 1648, the kings of Spain still used the title Count of Holland, but they had lost the actual power over the county to the States of Holland.

*Philip IV (1598–1621, titular only), King Philip III of Spain
*Philip V (1621–1648, titular only, renounced 1648), King Philip IV of Spain

== Aftermath ==

The county remained in existence as a constituent member state of the Dutch Republic until 1795. There were no more counts however since the Estates of Holland and West-Frisia were the sovereign of the county (although the countship was offered to William the Silent in 1584, shortly before his death). The stadtholders, who were servants of the Estates, were the de facto chief-executives during this period.

<text>Hydro-Man (Morris &quot;Morrie&quot; Bench) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil and artist John Romita Jr., the character first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #212 (January 1981). Hydro-Man is a recurring antagonist of the superhero Spider-Man.

Once an ordinary crewman, Morris Bench was accidentally knocked overboard while stationed on his ship during a battle between Spider-Man and Namor, and fell into the ocean, where a powerful experimental generator was being tested. This led to his transformation into Hydro-Man who, blaming Spider-Man for what happened to him, turned to a life of crime while seeking revenge against the web-slinger.

The character has appeared in several media adaptations over the years, including animated series and video games. A creature based on &quot;Hydro-Man&quot; appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019).

==Publication history==

The Morris Bench version of Hydro-Man made his first appearance in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #212 (January 1981) and was created by writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil and artist John Romita Jr.

==Fictional character biography==
Morris &quot;Morrie&quot; Bench gained his superpowers while working as a crewman on the cargo ship the U.S.S. &quot;Bulldog&quot;, having been knocked overboard accidentally by Spider-Man (right after the hero finished a fight against Namor) while a powerful experimental generator is being tested in the ocean. The combination of unknown radiation and his immersion in a deep ocean-dwelling bacteria turns him into Hydro-Man. When he realized that he had become a man-of-water, he blamed Spider-Man for his accident and started to hunt him (through many showers, sewers and water valves), in order to get revenge on the hero, but was defeated in combat.

Soon after that in the story arc &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;, he teams up with and briefly becomes merged with the Sandman into a composite mud monster called Mud-Thing. In this form, Hydro-Man and Sandman had limited intelligence and they did not have the ability to use their shape-shifting abilities as well as before. Although it was composed of the two aforementioned villains, it showed no indication of either villain&#x27;s persona outside of an infatuation with Sadie Frickett, the current love interest of both villains. 

Soon after, a theater agent named Travis Rave proposed that Sadie and Mud-Thing be in a show, which Sadie gladly accepted at the prospect of stardom. Unfortunately, when the show proved to be a huge success, Sadie accidentally kissed Travis out of excitement, thereby enraging the jealous Mud-Thing. Mud-Thing ended up going on a rampage and carried Sadie with him to the top a sky-scraper. The creature was eventually defeated with a special gas that dried it out and caused it to crumble apart. Spider-Man managed to save Sadie from her plummet, but she ended up being genuinely upset over the loss of Mud-Thing, knowing that all it had ever done wrong was simply love her. After its defeat by Spider-Man and the police, Sandman and Hydro-Man separated from this form when the police were cleaning up Mud-Thing&#x27;s remains. Months later, Hydro-Man and Sandman managed to separate themselves. Hydro-Man departs through the sewer telling Sandman that he will be going south for a while.

Hydro-Man joined supervillain teams such as the Sinister Syndicate, and the Frightful Four. While working with the Sinister Syndicate, Hydro-Man demonstrates a willingness to put up with just about anything in the name of financial gain. He ignores the constant politicking of the other members and looks past the Beetle&#x27;s betrayal of the group to the Kingpin in the belief that the group was economically beneficial to him. Hydro Man was a member of Crimson Cowl&#x27;s Masters of Evil, and battled the Thunderbolts. After the disintegration of the group, he began to cooperate with the Shocker. He was hired by Green Goblin to be part of his Sinister Twelve to help kill Spider-Man, but he was defeated again.

Hydro-Man was recruited by the Wizard to be a member of a new Frightful Four, the Wizard enhancing his powers while also implanting various security protocols that would allow the Wizard to trap Hydro-Man in a liquid-but-conscious state if he did anything that the Wizard disapproved of.

Morris was one of the 46 villains to escape the Raft when Sauron was broken out by Electro. Before escaping, he attempts to drown Jessica Drew, Matt Murdock, Foggy Nelson, and Luke Cage. After the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, he is seen alongside Shocker and Boomerang. This group attempts to rob Baily&#x27;s Auction House but are interrupted by Spider-Man and then members War Machine and Komodo. The latter are there to neutralize Spider-Man. The trio escapes, but they are later defeated by the Scarlet Spiders.

When a member of Wizard&#x27;s Frightful Five, Hydro-Man received a costume from Wizard that is made from the same material as the Human Torch&#x27;s costume. In the Frightful Five&#x27;s fight with the Fantastic Four, Hydro-Man was frozen in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere. Hydro-Man is hired by the Hood to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.

Hydro-Man appeared in &quot;Brand New Day&quot; as one of the villains in the Bar with No Name.

During the &quot;Spider-Island&quot; storyline, Hydro-Man battles the Young Allies as Spider-Man shows up to help defeat him.

When Spider-Man, his mind swapped with Doctor Octopus, sends a message to various supervillains to capture &quot;Spider-Man&quot; alive and bring him to &quot;Doctor Octopus&quot; in the Raft, Hydro Man is among the supervillains that receives the message. He is defeated and captured by employees of Horizon Labs.

In a plot to drown New York City in its filth as part of a ransom demand, Hydro-Man absorbed the wastewater from the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant. His plan was thwarted by Spider-Man with the help of Deadpool, where Spider-Man threw Deadpool inside of him with active grenades.

Hawkeye and a displaced version of Red Wolf from Earth-51920 later encounter Hydro-Man who is working for a group called Oasis Spring Water that has been draining the underground reservoir that&#x27;s on the property of the Sweet Medicine Indian Reservation. He managed to defeat Hawkeye and Red Wolf. After getting themselves free, Hawkeye and Red Wolf fight Oasis Spring Water again. While Red Wolf fights against the militia, Hawkeye engages Hydro-Man in battle. As the Fireheart family joined the fight, Silas Fireheart used electricity to help Hawkeye defeat Hydro-Man.

Hydro-Man later encounters a scientist named Dr. Rachna Koul who is working on &quot;curing him&quot;. When Hercules arrived with Human Torch and Thing, Hydro-Man lashed out at them thinking it was a trap. Dr. Koul then activates a machine that electrocutes Hydro-Man enough for him to retreat. After resurfacing in a pond, Hydro-Man sees someone by the campfire and plans to rob him only to discover that the man was a somehow-revived Wolverine.

Hydro-Man ran into Nakia whilst spelunking around an abandoned A.I.M. base in New York City, who enthralled him to her will using the jufeiro herb, leaving Bench to guard over the base to cover her tracks in the event her old colleges managed to follow her. When the rest of the Adored Ones accompanied by Spider-Man did infiltrate the undersea facility where a potential WMD of the wives in waiting&#x27;s design was kept. Hydro immediately set about his preprogrammed task, but was quickly dispatched by Okoye&#x27;s quick thinking and useful Wakandan Tech engineering.

At some point, Hydro-Man was captured and imprisoned in Atlantis, with Namor stealing his hydrokinesis to aid in his latest attack on the surface world. He was later freed by Captain America and Bucky Barnes.

At some point with his powers still intact, Hydro-Man joined Speed Demon and Shocker in robbing a bank.

In &quot;Sinister War&quot;, Hydro-Man was with Boomerang, Overdrive, Shocker, and Speed Demon when Kindred challenged them, the Sinister Six, the Savage Six, the Sinister Syndicate, and Foreigner&#x27;s group on who will kill Spider-Man first. It was also noted that Hydro-Man was not a member of the Superior Foes. Hydro-Man assists Boomerang, Shocker, and Speed Demon in fighting Foreigner&#x27;s group to buy Overdrive time to get Spider-Man away.

==Powers and abilities==
Hydro-Man is able to bodily transform himself into a watery liquid substance. He can access secure areas and small openings with relative ease. When his bodily mass is dispersed in this form it simply reforms, albeit slowly depending on how far apart the mass was. All of Hydro-Man&#x27;s cells remain fully under his control when he is in his liquid state. 

Hydro-Man can also merge with and manipulate larger bodies of water when he is in his liquid form. He can increase his mass and cause tidal waves and tsunamis. He can turn parts of his body to liquid while retaining the rest of his human form, allowing him to slip from a foe&#x27;s grasp or have projectiles like bullets harmlessly pass through him. Through great mental exertion, Hydro-Man can also turn into steam. Other examples of manipulating his watery form include firing off small streams such as a fire hose, shaping parts of his body into &#x27;solid-water&#x27; constructs, and mixing himself with other compounds for different effects.

The Wizard enhanced his powers through the use of sophisticated equipment. These artificial enhancements granted him increased and more precise control over bodies of water and moisture near him, which he demonstrated by absorbing nearly all the moisture in the Trapster&#x27;s body. His abilities were further augmented through the use of re-purposed super community technologies processed by Damage Control from the corrupt and deranged former CEO of the company, Walter Declun. However, Spider-Man teamed up with Iceman and used Iceman&#x27;s powers to solidify him into ice. Hydro-Man claims that he has not aged since he gained his powers. Hydro-Man possesses a certain degree of superhuman strength, and has been shown to be an exceptionally skilled fighter, and adept at using his powers for that purpose.

In some incarnations, depending on the writer, Hydro-Man can form his forearms into weapons such as Sandman does, except that Bench&#x27;s weapons are made of water. Bench has extensive experience in street-fighting techniques due to his experience as a criminal before his transformation. Though cunning, he has been consistently depicted by writers as a low tier henchman with little formal education and is often tricked into using his powers in ways that incapacitate him (as explained above). His normal attire consists of a black shirt and blue or green pants, as well as a costume invented by the Wizard.

But that opened up such amazing visual possibilities and poses really dangerous challenges for Spider-Man&quot;. Identified as the Water Elemental, it emerges from Venice&#x27;s canals, where Peter Parker and Mysterio defeat it.

<doc id="332168" wikidata="Q3038339" url="?curid=332168" title="Downtown Houston">
<text>Downtown is the largest central business district in the city of Houston and the largest in the state of Texas, located near the geographic center of the metropolitan area at the confluence of Interstate 10, Interstate 45, and Interstate 69. The district, enclosed by the aforementioned highways, contains the original townsite of Houston at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou, a point known as Allen&#x27;s Landing. Downtown has been the city&#x27;s preeminent commercial district since its founding in 1836.

Today home to nine &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 corporations, Downtown contains of office space and is the workplace of 150,000 employees. Downtown is also a major destination for entertainment and recreation. Nine major performing arts organizations are located within the 13,000-seat Theater District at prominent venues including Alley Theatre, Hobby Center for the Performing Arts, Jones Hall, and the Wortham Theater Center. Two major professional sports venues, Daikin Park and the Toyota Center, are home to the Houston Astros and Houston Rockets, respectively. Discovery Green, an urban park located on the east side of the district adjacent to the George R. Brown Convention Center, anchors the city&#x27;s convention district.

Downtown is Houston&#x27;s civic center, containing Houston City Hall, the jails, criminal, and civil courthouses of Harris County, a federal prison and courthouse. Downtown is also a major public transportation hub, lying at the center of the light rail system, park and ride system, and the metropolitan freeway network; the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County (METRO) is headquartered in the district. Over 100,000 people commute through Downtown daily. An extensive network of pedestrian tunnels and skywalks connects a large number of buildings in the district; this system also serves as a subterranean mall.

Geographically, Downtown is bordered by East Downtown to the east, Third Ward to the south, Midtown to the southwest, Fourth Ward to the west, Sixth Ward to the northwest, and Near Northside to the north. The district&#x27;s streets form a strict grid plan of approximately 400 square blocks, oriented at a southwest to northeast angle. The northern end of the district is crossed by Buffalo Bayou, the banks of which function as a linear park with a grade-separated system of hike-and-bike trails.

==Composition==
Downtown Houston is a area bounded by Interstate 45, Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59, and Interstate 10/U.S. Highway 90. Several sub-districts exist within Downtown, including:
* Ballpark – Includes Daikin Park and surrounding restaurants, lofts, and office space.
* Convention – Includes the George R. Brown Convention Center, Discovery Green, the Toyota Center, and some of the largest hotels in the city.
* Civic Center – Contains the core of Houston&#x27;s government, including City Hall – the Houston Public Library Central Library is also here,
* Harris County – The district includes the Harris County courts complex, and the University of Houston–Downtown is on the edge of the district.
* Historic – This was the original town center of Houston and dates from the 19th century. The center of the historic district is the Market Square, where the original city hall building stood. 
* Medical – located along Interstate 45 in the southern corner of the district; includes St. Joseph Medical Center, residential properties and the Sacred Heart Co-Cathedral campus.
* Shopping – Main Street Square has a pavilion and fountains built around the Main Street Square Station – GreenStreet and the Shops at Houston Center are in the area.
* Skyline – Includes many skyscrapers and forms the base of Downtown&#x27;s employment. The buildings are connected by the extensive tunnel network. 
* Theater – The 17 block area includes many performing arts venues, Bayou Place, and the Houston Aquarium.
* Warehouse – Home to Houston&#x27;s alternative art scene, unique dining options, live music, artists’ studios and downtown&#x27;s first lofts.

==History==


Downtown Houston encompasses the original townsite of Houston. After the Texas Revolution, two New York real estate investors, John Kirby Allen and Augustus Chapman Allen, purchased of land from Thomas F.L. Parrot and his wife, Elizabeth (John Austin&#x27;s widow), for US$9,428 (). The Allen brothers settled at the confluence of White Oak and Buffalo bayous, a spot now known as Allen&#x27;s Landing.

A team of three surveyors, including Gail Borden, Jr. (best known for inventing condensed milk) and Moses Lapham, platted a 62-square-block townsite in the fall of 1836, each block approximately 250 by 250 feet, or in size. The grid plan was designed to conform to the winding route of Buffalo Bayou; east–west streets were aligned at an angle of north 55º west, while north–south streets were at an angle of south 35º west. Each block was subdivided into 12 lots – five 50-by-100-foot lots on each side of the block, and two 50-by-125-foot lots between the rows of five. The Allen brothers, motivated by their vision for urban civic life, specified wide streets to easily accommodate commercial traffic and reserved blocks for schools, churches, and civic institutions. The townsite was then cleared and drained by a team of Mexican prisoners and black slaves. By April 1837, Houston featured a dock, commercial district, the capitol building of the Republic of Texas, and an estimated population of 1,500. The first city hall was sited at present-day Market Square Park in 1841; this block also served as the city&#x27;s preeminent retail market.

The relocation of the Texan republic&#x27;s capital to Houston required a significant political campaign by the Allen brothers. The Allens gifted a number of city blocks to prominent Texas politicians and agreed to construct the new capitol building and a large hotel at no cost to the government. The Allens also donated blocks to celebrities, relatives, prominent lawyers, and other influential people in order to attract additional investment and speculation to the town. During the late 1830s and early 1840s, Houston was in the midst of a land boom, and lots were selling at &quot;enormous prices,&quot; according to a visitor to the town in 1837.

Despite the efforts of the Allen brothers and high economic interest in the town, first few years of Houston&#x27;s existence were plagued by yellow fever epidemics, flooding, searing heat, inadequate infrastructure, and crime. Houston suffered from woefully inadequate city services; the Allens failed to accommodate transit, water service, sewerage, road paving, trash service, or gas service in their plans. As a result, in 1839 the Texas Capitol was moved to Austin.

In 1840, Houston adopted a ward system of municipal governance, which, at the time, was considered more democratic than a strong-mayor system and had already been adopted by the United States&#x27; largest cities. The boundaries of the original four wards of Houston radiated out from the intersection of Main and Congress streets; the First Ward was located to the northwest, Second to the northeast, Third to the southeast, and Fourth to the southwest. Fifth Ward was created in 1866, encompassing the area north of Buffalo Bayou and east of White Oak Bayou; Sixth Ward, the final addition to the system, replaced the section of Fourth Ward north of Buffalo Bayou in 1877. The ward system, which featured elected aldermen who served as representatives of each neighborhood, remained Houston&#x27;s form of municipal government until 1905, when the city switched to a commission government and the wards, as political entities, were dissolved.

Houston grew steadily throughout the late 19th century, and the neighborhoods within the boundaries of modern Downtown diversified. To the northeast, around present-day Daikin Park, Quality Hill emerged as an elite neighborhood, occupied by entrepreneurs like William Marsh Rice (namesake of Rice University), William J. Hutchins, and William L. Foley (namesake of Foley&#x27;s department stores). The neighborhood was well known for its opulent residential architecture, often in the Greek Revival style. To the north, along a bend in Buffalo Bayou, the working-class neighborhood of Frost Town welcomed immigrants from Europe and Mexico during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Prior to the arrival of the first streetcars in Houston in the 1870s, most development in the city had been centered in and around the present-day Downtown area. One of the first systems, the Houston City Street Railway, opened in 1874 with four lines along the principal commercial thoroughfares in the heart of the business district. While generally focused on the most prosperous areas of town, the Houston City Street Railway extended one line a full mile south of the center of the city, making it the first streetcar network designed to spur residential development. By the 1890s, new, larger local streetcar companies finally accumulated the capital necessary to begin constructing streetcar suburbs beyond the conventional boundaries of the city. This led to the development and rapid growth of areas like the Houston Heights and Montrose. Residential development subsequently moved out of the central business district; Quality Hill was virtually abandoned by the turn of the 20th century.

Downtown&#x27;s growth can be attributed to two major factors: The first arose after the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, when investors began seeking a location close to the ports of Southwest Texas, but apparently free of the dangerous hurricanes that frequently struck Galveston and other port cities. Houston became a wise choice, as only the most powerful storms were able to reach the city. The second came a year later with the 1901 discovery of oil at Spindletop, just south of Beaumont, Texas. Shipping and oil industries began flocking to east Texas, many settling in Houston. From that point forward the area grew substantially, as many skyscrapers were constructed, including the city&#x27;s tallest buildings. In the 1980s, however, economic recession canceled some projects and caused others to be scaled back, such as the Bank of the Southwest Tower.

In the 19th century much of what was the Third Ward, the present day east side of Downtown Houston, was what Stephen Fox, an architectural historian who lectured at Rice University, referred to as &quot;the elite neighborhood of late 19th-century Houston.&quot; Ralph Bivins of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote that Fox said that area was &quot;a silk-stocking neighborhood of Victorian-era homes.&quot; Bivins said that the construction of Union Station, which occurred around 1910, caused the &quot;residential character&quot; of the area to &quot;deteriorate.&quot; Hotels opened in the area to service travelers. Afterwards, according to Bivins, the area &quot;began a long downward slide toward the skid row of the 1990s&quot; and the hotels devolved into flophouses. Passenger trains stopped going to Union Station in 1974. The construction of Interstate 45 in the 1950s separated portions of the historic Third Ward from the rest of the Third Ward and brought those portions into Downtown.

Beginning in the 1960s the development of the 610 Loop caused the focus of the Houston area to move away from Downtown Houston. Joel Barna of &quot;Cite 42&quot; said that this caused Greater Houston to shift from &quot;a fragmenting but still centrally focused spatial entity into something more like a doughnut,&quot; and that Downtown Houston began to become a &quot;hole&quot; in the &quot;doughnut.&quot; As interchange connections with the 610 Loop opened, according to Barna Downtown &quot;became just another node in a multi-node grid&quot; and, as of 1998, &quot;has been that, with already established high densities and land prices.&quot; In the mid-1980s, the bank savings and loan crisis forced many tenants in Downtown Houston buildings to retrench, and some tenants went out of business. Barna said that this development further caused Downtown Houston to decline.

The Gulf Hotel fire occurred in 1943.

Areas which are now considered part of Downtown were once within Third and the Fourth wards; the construction of Interstate 45 in the 1950s separated the areas from their former communities and placed them in Downtown. Additional freeway construction in the 1960s and 1970s solidified the current boundaries of Downtown. Originally, Downtown was the most important retail area of Houston. Suburban retail construction in the 1970s and 1980s reduced Downtown&#x27;s importance in terms of retail activity.

From 1971 to 2018, about 40 downtown buildings and other properties have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The onset of the 1980s oil glut had devastating economic consequences for Downtown. In the mid-1980s, a bank savings and loan crisis forced many tenants in Downtown Houston buildings to retrench, and some went out of business. This development further caused Downtown Houston to decline. In 1986, Downtown&#x27;s Class A office occupancy rate was 81.4%. The Downtown Houston business occupancy rate of all office space increased from 75.8% at the end of 1987 to 77.2% at the end of 1988. By the late 1980s, 35% of Downtown Houston&#x27;s land area consisted of surface parking. In the early 1990s Downtown Houston still had more than 20% vacant office space. By 1987 many of the office buildings in Downtown Houston were owned by non-U.S. real estate figures.

Downtown began to rebound from the oil crisis by the mid-1990s. A dozen companies relocated to Downtown in 1996 alone, bringing 2,800 jobs and filling of space. In 1997 Tim Reylea, the vice president of Cushman Realty, said that &quot;None of the major central business districts across the country has seen the suburban-to-downtown shift that Houston has.&quot; Circa 2000 the Ballpark at Union Station/Enron Field, now Daikin Park, opened, Houston Downtown Management District president Bob Eury stated that this promoted subsequent development in Downtown.

By 2000, demand for Downtown office space increased, and construction of office buildings resumed. The cutbacks by firms such as Dynegy, in addition to the fall of Enron, caused the occupancy rate of Downtown Houston buildings to decrease to 84.1% in 2003 from 97.3% less than two years previously. In 2003, the types of firms with operations in Downtown Houston typically were accounting firms, energy firms, and law firms. Typically newer buildings had higher occupancy rates than older buildings. In 2004, the real estate firm Cresa Partners stated that the vacancy rate in Downtown Houston&#x27;s Class A office space was almost 20%. The Texas Legislature established the Downtown Houston Management District in 1995.

Circa/after the 1990s, Downtown has experienced a boom in high-rise residential construction, spurred in large part by the Downtown Living Initiative (DLI), a tax incentive program created by the city. Between 2013 and 2015, the DLI subsidized 5,000 proposed residential units. As a result, Downtown&#x27;s residential population has increased to 10,165 people in 4,777 units, up from 900 units in the 1995. Many of Downtown&#x27;s older residential units are located in lofts and converted commercial space, many of which are located around the performance halls of the Houston Theater District and near Main Street in the Historic District. In spring 2009, luxury high-rise One Park Place opened-up with 346 units. In early 2017 Downtown&#x27;s largest residential building opened when Market Square Tower&#x27;s 463 units were completed.

Developers have invested more than US$4 billion in the first decade of the 21st century to transform Downtown into an active city center with residential housing, a nightlife scene and new transportation. The Cotswold Project, a $62 million project started in 1998, has helped to rebuild the streets and transform 90 downtown blocks into a pedestrian-friendly environment by adding greenery, trees and public art. January 1, 2004, marked the opening of the &quot;new&quot; Main Street, a plaza with many eateries, bars and nightclubs, which brings many visitors to a newly renovated locale.

Phoenicia Specialty Foods opened a downtown grocery store in 2011, located in One Park Place.

In June 2019 Dianna Wray of &quot;Houstonia&quot; wrote that Downtown Houston had an increased amount of pedestrian traffic and residents compared to the post-oil bust 1980s.

Office traffic declined during the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas. By 2022 many offices had split shifts to where workers only went to offices for some days of the week. By 2022 activity at hotel and entertainment establishments recovered.

In May 2024, a derecho struck the downtown Houston causing damage.

==Architecture==

In the 1960s, downtown comprised a modest collection of mid-rise office structures, but has since grown into one of the largest skylines in the United States. In 1960, the central business district had 10 million square feet (930,000 m2) of office space, increasing to about 16 million square feet (1,500,000 m2) in 1970. Downtown Houston was on the threshold of a boom in 1970 with 8.7 million square feet (800,000 m2) of office space planned or under construction and huge projects being launched by real estate developers. The largest proposed development was the 32-block Houston Center. Only a small part of the original proposal was ultimately constructed, however. Other large projects included the Cullen Center, Allen Center, and towers for Shell Oil Company. The surge of skyscrapers mirrored the skyscraper booms in other cities, such as Los Angeles and Dallas. Houston experienced another downtown construction spurt in the 1970s with the energy industry boom.
The first major skyscraper to be constructed in Houston was the 50-floor, One Shell Plaza in 1971. A succession of skyscrapers were built throughout the 1970s, culminating with Houston&#x27;s tallest skyscraper, the 75-floor, JPMorgan Chase Tower (formerly the Texas Commerce Tower), which was completed in 1982. In 2002, it was the tallest structure in Texas, ninth-tallest building in the United States, and the 23rd tallest skyscraper in the world. In 1983, the 71-floor, Wells Fargo Plaza was completed, which became the second-tallest building in Houston and Texas, and 11th-tallest in the country. Skyscraper construction in downtown Houston came to an end in the mid-1980s with the collapse of Houston&#x27;s energy industry and the resulting economic recession.

Twelve years later, the Houston-based Enron Corporation began constructing a 40-floor, 1,284,013sq.ft skyscraper in 1999 (which was completed in 2002) with the company collapsing in one of the most dramatic corporate failures in the history of the United States only two years later. Chevron bought this building to set up a regional upstream energy headquarters, and in late 2006 announced further consolidation of employees downtown from satellite suburban buildings, and even California and Louisiana offices by leasing the original Enron building across the street. Both buildings are connected by a second-floor unique walk-across, air-conditioned circular skybridge with three points of connection to both office buildings and a large parking deck. Other smaller office structures were built in the 2000–2003 period. As of January 2015, downtown Houston had more than 44 million square feet (4,087,733 m2) of office space, including more than 29 million square feet (1,861,704 m2) of class A office space.

=== Notable buildings ===

Notable buildings that form Houston&#x27;s downtown skyline:

* The Sweeney, Coombs, and Fredericks Building is a late Victorian commercial building with a 3-story corner turret and Eastlake decorative elements that was designed by George E. Dickey in 1889. Evidence indicates that the 1889 construction may have been a renovation of an 1861 structure built by William A. Van Alstyne and purchased in 1882 by John Jasper Sweeney and Edward L. Coombs. Gus Fredericks joined the Sweeney and Coombs Jewelry firm before 1889. The building is on the corner of Main Street and Congress Street at 301 Main Street. The jewelry firm is still in business. It is one of the very few Victorian structures in the Bayou City.
*The Gulf Building, now called the JPMorgan Chase building, is one of the preeminent Art Deco skyscrapers in the southern United States. Completed in 1929, it remained the tallest building in Houston until 1963, when the Exxon Building surpassed it in height.
* The Esperson Buildings, &#x27;Neils&#x27; built in 1927 and &#x27;Mellie&#x27; in 1942, were modeled with Italian architecture.
* The Houston City Hall was started in 1938 and completed in 1939. The original building is an excellent example of the Art Deco Era. In front of City Hall is the George Hermann Square.
*The Alley Theatre was completed in 1968. It is home to the Tony Award winning theatre company by the same name, the oldest professional theatre company in Texas. Its nine towers and brutality style give it a castle appearance.

* The Enron Center South, also the Enron II, designed by Cesar Pelli was completed in 2002. (Note: Enron went bankrupt before the building&#x27;s completion and was sold soon after it was completed for about half of its $200 million construction cost).
* The Hobby Center for the Performing Arts was started in 2000 and completed in 2002.
* The Lyric Centre, named for its adjacency to the Theater District.
* The Carter Building, once the tallest building in Texas, more recently re-purposed as a hotel.
* The Scanlan Building, at Main and Preston, was built on the site of the first official &quot;White House&quot; of the Republic of Texas. Constructed in 1909 by the daughters of Thomas Howe Scanlan to honor their father, former mayor of Houston (1870–1873). The Scanlan Building is listed in the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and was the largest building in the city at the time of its construction.

Continental Airlines (now known as United Airlines) formerly had its headquarters in Continental Center I. At one point, ExpressJet Airlines had its headquarters in Continental&#x27;s complex. In September 1997 Continental Airlines announced it would consolidate its Houston headquarters in the Continental Center complex; the airline scheduled to move its employees in stages beginning in July 1998 and ending in January 1999. Bob Lanier, Mayor of Houston, said that he was &quot;tickled to death&quot; by the airline&#x27;s move to relocate to Downtown Houston. Tim Reylea, the vice president of Cushman Realty, said that the Continental move &quot;is probably the largest corporate relocation in the central business district of Houston ever.&quot;

Hotel operators in Downtown reacted favorably, predicting that the move would cause an increase in occupancy rates in their hotels. In 2008 Continental renewed its lease in the building. Before the lease renewal, rumors spread stating that the airline would relocate its headquarters to office space outside of Downtown. Steven Biegel, the senior vice president of Studley Inc. and a representative of office building tenants, said that if Continental&#x27;s space went vacant, the vacancy would not have had a significant impact in the Downtown Houston submarket as there is not an abundance of available space, and the empty property would be likely that another potential tenant would occupy it. Jennifer Dawson of the &quot;Houston Business Journal&quot; said that if Continental Airlines left Continental Center I, the development of Brookfield Properties&#x27;s new office tower would have been delayed. As of September 2011 the headquarters moved out, but Continental will continue to house employees in the building. It will have about half of the employees that it once had.

Houston Industries (HI, later Reliant Energy) and subsidiary Houston Power &amp; Lighting (HL&amp;P) historically had their headquarters in Downtown.

Halliburton&#x27;s corporate headquarters office was in 5 Houston Center. In 2001, Halliburton canceled a move to redevelop land in Westchase to house employees; real estate figures associated with Downtown Houston approved of the news. Nancy Sarnoff of the &quot;Houston Business Journal&quot; said it made more sense for the company to lease existing space instead of constructing new office space in times of economic downturns. By 2009 Halliburton closed its Downtown Office, moved its headquarters to northern Houston, and consolidated operations at its northern Houston and Westchase facilities.

Katharine Shilcutt of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; said in 2012 that because of the Houston tunnel system taking traffic during the daytime and many office workers leaving for suburbs at night, many street level restaurants in Downtown Houston have difficulty operating. She added that the popularity of business-related lunches and dinners resulted in steakhouses in Downtown becoming successful.

Clear said &quot;I hate to say we danced on their grave, but we weren&#x27;t unhappy about the way things turned out.&quot; Clear planned to introduce his magazine in May 1991. As of January 1991 he had not decided on a name for the magazine. Elise Perachio became the editor of the magazine, which was ultimately named &quot;Downtown, Inc.&quot; On August 1, 1994, the magazine, then called Downtown Voice, was sold to company Media Ink.

<text>Walter Joseph Hickel (August 18, 1919 – May 7, 2010) was an American businessman, real estate developer, and politician who served as the second governor of Alaska from 1966 to 1969 and 1990 to 1994, as well as U.S. Secretary of the Interior from 1969 to 1970. He worked as a construction worker and eventually became a construction company operator during Alaska&#x27;s territorial days. Following World War II, Hickel became heavily involved with real estate development, building residential subdivisions, shopping centers and hotels. Hickel entered politics in the 1950s during Alaska&#x27;s battle for statehood and remained politically active for the rest of his life.

Hickel served as the second governor of Alaska, defeating incumbent and first governor William A. Egan in 1966. He served as governor until 1969, ending with his resignation upon his appointment to the position of United States Secretary of the Interior in the cabinet of President Richard Nixon. Hickel later served a full term as governor from 1990 to 1994 under the banner of the Alaskan Independence Party.

==Early life and career==
Hickel was born in 1919 in Ellinwood, Kansas, the son of Emma Pauline (Zecha) and Robert Anton Hickel. He grew up on his parents&#x27; Dust Bowl tenant farm during the Great Depression near Claflin, Kansas. In October 1940 he moved to Alaska and traveled to it aboard the &quot;S.S. Yukon&quot; with 95 other passengers and went into the local real estate industry. Seven years later in 1947 he had founded a successful construction company.

Hickel joined Democrats in calling for Alaskan statehood during the late 1940s and into the 1950s. In 1958, the Alaska Statehood Act was signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

==Political career==
===1950s===

By the 1950s, he was the finance chairman of the Republican Party and, in 1952, received the backing of businessmen in Anchorage for the territorial governorship, but Benjamin Heintzleman was appointed instead. In 1953, Hickel along with the national committeewoman for Alaska, the vice chairman for the territorial party and his wife went to the Republican Party&#x27;s western conference in San Francisco and was later elected as head of the Anchorage Republican Club. In December 1953, he and eighteen other prominent Republicans from Anchorage sent a letter to Governor Heintzleman requesting the resignation of Robert DeArmond and that he be replaced with somebody from Anchorage, and they later telegrammed Secretary of the Intertior Douglas McKay asking him to build up the party and also asked Heintzleman to reconsider his decision to cancel his meeting with them.

===First governorship===
Hickel was elected as Alaska&#x27;s second governor in the 1966 state general elections, defeating his Democratic rival and incumbent governor Bill Egan. Hickel&#x27;s first governorship, the second in the young state&#x27;s history as well as Alaska&#x27;s first Republican governorship, oversaw the discovery of oilfields at Prudhoe Bay in 1968, a factor that would prove politically decisive in later years. Hickel, a moderate Republican and environmentalist, did not push for heavy oil exploitation. Nevertheless, during his first few months in office, his administration approved the sale of oil leases on 37,000 acres of the North Slope despite opposition from Alaskan Natives. In November 1968, Hickel&#x27;s department of transportation began construction on a 400-mile road from Livengood to Prudhoe Bay that would later be known as the Hickel Highway. The same year, Hickel appointed Ted Stevens to the United States Senate to replace the recently deceased Bob Bartlett.

Like his predecessor Egan, Hickel sought to improve relations with Alaskan Natives in seeking resolutions on Native land claims. A group of Native Americans from Interior Alaska, including Morris Thompson and Don and Jules Wright, played major roles in his 1966 campaign and subsequent governorship.

===Interior secretary===

Richard Nixon&#x27;s election as U.S. President in late 1968 led to an offer to Hickel from the President-elect to serve in the United States Cabinet as Interior Secretary. Initially, Hickel declined the cabinet offer. Nixon replied that his decision was final. Hickel would recall years later that he cried afterward and announced that he would be resigning from the governorship to go to Washington.

Hickel&#x27;s nomination was met with what he later wrote was a newspaper &quot;smear&quot; campaign of false and &quot;crazy accusations&quot; that he had a corrupt and anti-environmentalist record as governor. Opposition to his nomination was led by influential columnists Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson. Newspapers opposing his nomination included the New York &quot;Times&quot; and the Los Angeles &quot;Times&quot;. In the Senate, his confirmation was opposed by, among others, Democratic senators Walter Mondale and George McGovern. Sierra Club director David Brower testified in opposition to Hickel. The Senate nevertheless confirmed his nomination on 23 January 1969.

Upon becoming the federal Secretary of the Interior, Hickel proved to be a strong environmentalist, supporting strong legislation that put liabilities on oil companies operating offshore oil rigs as well as demanding environmental safeguards on Alaska&#x27;s growing oil industry.

Hickel&#x27;s centrist voice inside the Nixon Administration eventually led to confrontations with the President. In 1970 following the shooting of college students at Kent State University by the Ohio National Guard, Hickel wrote a letter critical of Nixon&#x27;s Vietnam War policy and urging him to give more respect to the views of young people critical of the war, writing in part, &quot;I believe this administration finds itself today embracing a philosophy which appears to lack appropriate concern for the attitude of a great mass of Americans – our young people.&quot; That dissent garnered worldwide media attention, and on November 25, 1970, Hickel was fired over the letter. Days before he lost the office, Hickel had told CBS&#x27; &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that he would not quit under pressure and that he would go away only &quot;with an arrow in my heart, not a bullet in my back.&quot; Hickel&#x27;s undersecretaries, such as Leslie Glasgow, who was in charge of Fish, Wildlife, Parks, and Marine Resources, were also dismissed. After less than two years in Washington, Glasgow returned to Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, where he was a professor with expertise in the study of wildlife in the marshes.

===Second governorship===

A blanket primary held on August 28, 1990, resulted in Arliss Sturgulewski, a member of the Alaska Senate from Anchorage since 1979, winning the Republican nomination for governor of Alaska. Winning the Democratic nomination was Tony Knowles, the immediate past mayor of Anchorage.

The Republicans chose as their nominee for lieutenant governor Jack Coghill, a fellow state senator from Nenana. Coghill had held elected office continuously since 1957 with the exception of relinquishing the mayorship of Nenana for approximately two years, when the 1967 flood forced him to move from the city limits temporarily. Coghill had also briefly worked as a special assistant to Hickel during his first governorship.

Sturgulewski, who won the Republican nomination for the second consecutive time against mostly conservative opposition, was criticized by many Republicans for her positions on issues such as abortion and capital punishment. Following a contentious meeting between Sturgulewski and prominent conservative Republicans held in the home of David Cuddy, Coghill felt that it was impossible to continue to run on the ticket with Sturgulewski. After Coghill met first with Hickel and then with Edgar Paul Boyko, the idea was hatched to run a slate of Hickel and Coghill under the Alaskan Independence Party banner. AIP chairman Joe Vogler was brought from Fairbanks to Anchorage immediately prior to the deadline for political parties to substitute their nominees.

John Lindauer and Jerry Ward, who had been chosen in the primary as the AIP ticket (and would, eight years later, win another blanket primary as the Republican Party&#x27;s nominees for governor and lieutenant governor), stepped aside, largely alluding to the illness of Lindauer&#x27;s wife as the reason. Hickel and Coghill prevailed in the general election.

Although he had common ground with the Alaskan Independence Party in fighting restrictions on land use imposed by federal environmentalism, Hickel had been one of the most influential historical proponents of Alaska statehood and never endorsed the AIP&#x27;s secessionism, prompting some party faithful to petition for his recall. He rejoined the Republican Party in April 1994, near the end of his term.

Hickel wanted to build a water pipeline from Alaska to California in 1991.

==Business career==

Wally Hickel was a prominent real estate developer and successful businessman, with a focus on hotels and shopping centers. As chairman of the Hickel Investment Company, he oversaw the construction and operation of numerous properties, including those built to house Safeway&#x27;s initial stores in Alaska.

In 1964, Hickel decided to build a high-rise luxury hotel in downtown Anchorage following the devastating 1964 Alaska earthquake. Despite skepticism that the area could not be redeveloped extensively, he chose a site close to one of the largest landslides in the area as a show of confidence in the city&#x27;s future. The result was the Hotel Captain Cook, a nine-story luxury hotel that opened in 1965 on Fourth Avenue, adjacent to the historic Wendler Building.

Hickel&#x27;s confidence in the project was not misplaced, as the hotel grew to become a major landmark in Anchorage. A fifteen-story tower was added in 1972, followed by an eighteen-story tower in 1978. Today, the Hotel Captain Cook covers almost an entire city block and includes a connected parking garage covering another half-block. 

Overall, Hickel&#x27;s business career was marked by a commitment to development that balanced economic growth with environmental responsibility. His success as a businessman provided him with the resources and platform to pursue public service and activism, where he continued to advocate for sustainable development and environmental protection.

==Later life==

In 2006 he supported Sarah Palin in her bid to become governor of Alaska; however, in 2009, he stated that he didn&#x27;t &quot;give a damn what she does&quot;.

In 2008, he called for the resignation of U.S. Senator Ted Stevens, whom he had appointed to the Senate in 1968. His statement was made in light of the August 2008 federal indictment of Stevens related to the alleged receipt of improper gifts from Bill Allen, CEO of the VECO Corporation, an Alaskan construction company heavily involved in the Alaskan oil industry. Stevens was found guilty by a Washington D.C. jury of seven felonies in October 2008, narrowly losing his November election to Democrat Mark Begich, eight days later. Stevens&#x27; conviction was later set aside by the federal trial judge over the issue of prosecutorial misconduct. The Justice Department under Eric Holder declined to refile charges against the ex-Senator.

==Death==
Hickel died on May 7, 2010, in Anchorage, Alaska. In keeping with his often-stated wish, he was buried in Anchorage Memorial Park, standing up, facing east towards Washington, D.C.

==Architecture==



The Uptown District boomed along with Houston during the 1970s and early 1980s. A collection of mid-rise office buildings appeared along the Interstate 610 west (or simply &quot;West Loop&quot;). It became one of the most impressive instances of the edge city. The highest achievement of Uptown was the construction of the landmark Williams Tower, designed by Philip Johnson (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time, it was believed to be the world&#x27;s tallest skyscraper outside of a central business district. The Williams Tower was the product of a unique era in Houston: energy companies were highly profitable entities and they sought impressive, monumental structures to broadcast their power.

The Williams Waterwall is a multi-story sculptural fountain which sits at the south end of Williams Tower in Uptown. It and its surrounding park were built as an architectural amenity to the adjacent tower. Both the fountain and tower were designed by Pritzker Prize winning architect Philip Johnson. Construction of the complex was completed in 1983. The semi-circular fountain is tall and sits among 118 Texas Live Oak trees. Approximately of water flow over both sides of the wall every minute.
The Uptown District is also home to other buildings designed by noted architects such as I. M. Pei and César Pelli among others also designed by Philip Johnson; Pelli designed the Four Oaks Place complex. Large-scale office construction in Uptown came to an end with the collapse of energy prices and the meltdown of Houston&#x27;s economy in the mid-to-late 1980s. Uptown had 23.8 million square feet (2,210,000 m2) of office space in 2001, whereas Downtown Houston had about 40 million square feet (4,000,000 m2). In the late 1990s, there was a mini-boom of mid-rise residential tower construction, typically about 30 stories tall. Uptown has accumulated a large concentration of high-rise residential structures.

Four Leaf Towers, a high-rise residential complex consisting of two 40-story buildings located on San Felipe Street was constructed in 1982. The towers were designed by architect César Pelli.

Completed in 2004, Saint Martin&#x27;s Episcopal Church (with spires and antennae reaching into the sky), designed by Jackson &amp; Ryan Architects, was featured on the covers of three national magazines: &quot;Civil Engineering&quot; magazine (April 2005), &quot;Modern Steel Construction&quot; magazine (May 2005) and &quot;Structure&quot; magazine (December 2005).

==Government and infrastructure==

===Local government===

Uptown Houston is a Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone (TIRZ), which is a self-imposed taxing entity created by property owners in economically challenged areas in order to fund improvements and encourage development within the zone. The area was designated as a TIRZ by city council. The Uptown District has used the funds for landscaping and mobility improvements as well as specialty street lamps, signage and stainless steel gateways and halos over major streets and intersections.

Houston Fire Department operates Fire Station 28, a station in District 28, west of Uptown. Station 28 moved to a location at Westheimer Road at Sage in what is now Uptown in 1953. The station moved to Chimney Rock at Dolores in 1987. The station received a minor renovation in the fiscal year of 2006.
The neighborhood is served by the Houston Police Department&#x27;s Midwest Patrol Division, headquartered in Greater Sharpstown.

Residents are a part of Houston City Council District G. In the first 1991 Mayor of Houston election most voters within and around Uptown voted for Bob Lanier.

The Uptown Management District is headquartered in Suite 1580 in 2 Post Oak Central at 1980 Post Oak Boulevard in the Post Oak Central complex.

===County, state, and federal representation===

Uptown Houston is located in Texas&#x27;s 7th congressional district and Harris County Precinct 3.
The United States Postal Service operates the Galleria Post Office in Suite 1200 at 5015 Westheimer Road, in Uptown Houston.

==Parks and recreation==
The City of Houston announced in December 2008 that it would purchase the Williams Tower Park and Fountain from Hines REIT for approximately $8.5 million. The city will operate the site as a public park protecting the popular park and landmark waterwall fountain from the threat of future development. Hines and the city will share maintenance and upkeep costs of the park and fountain.

In addition the City of Houston operates the Post Oak Park at the intersection of Post Oak Drive and the 610 Loop.

In 2007 the city seized land from James and Jock Collins via eminent domain in order to widen San Felipe and convert the rest into a park. The city planned to build the Post Oak Lane Park, a pocket park in Uptown. The pocket park is so small that it will not have a basketball court. City of Houston officials, including the Mayor of Houston Bill White and the Houston City Council, said that there was a public need for the park. The City of Houston operates the Grady Park, which is located outside Uptown and two blocks away from the site of the Post Oak Lane Park.

According to Carolyn Feibel and Bradley Olson of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; obtained documents that show that the city eminent domain helped Ed Wulfe, the developer of the BLVD Place complex adjacent to the park, complete a $12.5 million land sale related to the development. Wulfe was a major donor to White. As of December 2008 the city had not created any plans for the Post Oak Lane Park. Houston Parks and Recreation Director Joe Turner said in a sworn disposition in November 2008 that his department did not create the idea of the park and that he opposed the usage of eminent domain. The Collins brothers said that the city government had used eminent domain to seize land only for the purposes of private development, which is not legal in Texas.

On December 8, 2006, the Uptown District and the Texas Department of Transportation opened the Hidalgo Park, located south of the Galleria. The park, previously a vacant plot of land, has 650 trees and shrubs and of sod. The park includes a pond with a lighted fountain; the fountain was first activated on the day of the park&#x27;s opening.

Prior to 1998, the &quot;Houston Press&quot; was located in Suite 1900 of the 2000 West Loop South building in Uptown. In 1998, it moved to a new location in Downtown Houston.

===Rapid transit===
METRORail expansion plans include the Uptown/Gold Line which will serve the Uptown Houston area and run primarily down the median strip of Post Oak Boulevard. In 2010, Houston Mayor Annise Parker announced that there were no available funds to construct the rail line, although it still remains in METRO&#x27;s future expansion plans. In 2013, it was announced that the line will be constructed initially as a bus rapid transit line, but with the capability to convert to light rail in the future.

<doc id="332178" wikidata="Q313117" url="?curid=332178" title="Luis Carrero Blanco">
<text>Admiral-General Luis Carrero Blanco (; 4 March 1904 – 20 December 1973) was a Spanish Navy officer and politician. A long-time confidant and right-hand man of dictator Francisco Franco, Carrero served as Prime Minister of Spain.
Upon graduating from the naval academy Carrero Blanco participated in the Rif War, and later the Spanish Civil War, in which he supported the Rebel faction. He became one of the most prominent figures in the Francoist dictatorship&#x27;s power structure and held throughout his career a number of high-ranking offices such as those of Undersecretary of the Presidency from 1941 to 1967 and Franco&#x27;s deputy from 1967 to 1973. He also was the main drafter behind the 1947 Law of Succession to the Headship of the State. Franco handpicked him as his successor in the role of head of government, with Carrero thereby taking office in June 1973.

Shortly after he became prime minister, Carrero Blanco was assassinated in Madrid in a streetside bombing on 20 December 1973 by the Basque nationalist group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) while he was returning from Mass in his car.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===
Luis Carrero Blanco was born on 4 March 1904 in the coastal town of Santoña, province of Santander, to Camilo Carrero Gutiérrez (1879–1936), a lieutenant colonel in the Army stationed in nearby Santander, and Ángeles Blanco Abascal (1885–1910) a local woman. He had his early schooling at the in Santoña and in 1918, at the age of 14, he followed the family military tradition by enlisting at the Spanish Naval Academy in San Fernando, Cádiz.

By 18, he had already achieved the rank of lieutenant, serving aboard the dreadnought &quot;Alfonso XIII&quot; and participated in the Rif War from 1924 to 1926. In 1926, he decided to specialise in submarine warfare, and served as lieutenant commander on the &quot;B-2&quot; and as commander on the &quot;B-5&quot;.

In 1929, he married María del Carmen Pichot y Villa (1909–1984) with whom he had five children.

=== Civil war ===
At the outset of the Spanish Civil War, Carrero Blanco was a naval instructor teaching submarine tactics at the Naval Warfare College in Madrid. As a military man of conservative views he knew that he was marked; his brother José had already been detained and subsequently executed and his father died on the day of his arrest. Like many nationalists, he sought refuge first in the Mexican embassy and later that of France, from where he was able to cross the border from San Sebastián into France and re-enter on the Nationalist side in June 1937.

Carrero Blanco then served in the Nationalist navy first as corvette captain aboard the destroyer &quot;Huesca&quot; and later the submarine &quot;General Sanjurjo&quot;. Following the Nationalist victory and subsequent establishment of &quot;Generalísimo&quot; Franco as &quot;Caudillo&quot; of Spain, Carrero Blanco was appointed Chief of Naval Operations in August 1939.

=== Political career ===

In May 1941, Franco appointed Carrero (age 37) as Under-Secretary of the Presidency of the Government, replacing Valentín Galarza Morante. Following the 1942 Begoña incident, Carrero advised Franco to remove Ramón Serrano Suñer from ministerial rank and from the post of president of the Political Junta of FET y de las JONS, and so Franco did. Carrero was—as Joan Maria Thomàs puts it—&quot;extremely faithful and submissive to El Caudillo&quot;, a polar opposite of Suñer, of whom the dictator had become weary (despite their family connection).

Carrero Blanco was made Vice-Admiral in 1963 and Admiral in 1966. He was Deputy Prime Minister from 1967 to 1973. By that time Franco, even if he was still then the head of state and concurrent Prime Minister, had already delegated the day-to-day running of the government over to Carrero Blanco himself, owing to the former&#x27;s old age and illness. The latter excelled in this regard, in terms of carrying Franco&#x27;s policies and in directing the ministries towards that direction.

Upon the nomination of Juan Carlos of Bourbon as heir to Franco in the headship of state in 1969, it was believed that an authoritarian monarchy guided by Carrero would guarantee the continuation of Francoism without Franco, an idea underpinned by Franco&#x27;s own words during the Bourbon&#x27;s nominating speech: (&#x27;all is tied down and well tied down&#x27;).

Carrero reached the peak of his political career on 8 June 1973, when Franco—as envisaged in the 1967 Organic Law of the State that separated the functions of head of government from those of head of state—appointed Carrero as Prime Minister. 

The supporters of the aforementioned authoritarian monarchic continuation to the Francoist regime (the solution) suffered two successive blows in the wake of the assassination of Carrero in 1973, and the overthrow of the neighbouring Portuguese regime in 1974.

== Assassination ==
Six months after being named prime minister, Carrero Blanco was assassinated on 20 December 1973 in Madrid by four members of an ETA cell, who carried out a bombing near San Francisco de Borja Church on Calle de Serrano while he returned from daily mass in a Spanish Dodge 3700.

In a collective interview justifying the attack, the ETA bombers said:

 The assassination enjoyed the tacit approval of many Spaniards, who joked about Carrero being Spain&#x27;s first astronaut.

In his first speech to the Cortes on 12 February 1974, Carrero Blanco&#x27;s successor as prime minister, Carlos Arias Navarro, promised liberalizing reforms including the right to form political associations. Though he was denounced by Falangists, the transition had begun.

=== Reprisal ===
One of the members of the cell who had assassinated Carrero Blanco was himself assassinated by a car bomb in southern France on 21 December 1978 by a special team organized within the Navy. This group included a member of the Higher Centre of Defense Information secret service, another from the Naval Intelligence Service and the other belonged to the Defense High Command. In addition, it received assistance from a number of right-wing paramilitary groups through Jean-Pierre Cherid (OAS), José María Boccardo (Argentine Anticommunist Alliance) and Mario Ricci (Avanguardia Nazionale).

Argala, the codename by which the ETA member was known, was the only one who could identify the source who had handed Carrero Blanco&#x27;s schedule and itinerary over to ETA. According to &quot;Leonidas&quot;, a former member of the Spanish Army who participated in the bombing against Argala, &quot;The explosives came from a US base. I don&#x27;t remember exactly if it was from Torrejón or Rota, but I do know that the Americans did not know what they would be used for. It was a personal favour for Pedro el Marino&quot; (Pedro Martínez) who provided the explosives. Argala&#x27;s assassination was claimed by the Spanish Basque Battalion. However, according to &quot;Leonidas&quot;, &quot;BVE, ATE&quot; (Anti-Terrorismo ETA) or &quot;Triple A&quot; are only labels of convenience that are used by the same group.

===Funeral and burial===
Carrero Blanco&#x27;s funeral, which would be one of Franco&#x27;s last public appearances, was held the following day at the Basilica of Saint Francis the Great, Madrid and he was buried at Mingorrubio Cemetery in the neighbouring municipality of El Pardo. Carrero was posthumously elevated to &quot;Captain general of the Navy&quot; and declared &quot;Duke of Carrero Blanco&quot;.

== Ideology and positions ==

Carrero did not clearly belong to any family within the regime. His ultimate identification was with the work of the Dictator; as such, he can be considered a pure Francoist. Antonio Elorza described the most distinct features of his ideology as being counter-revolution, anticommunism and satanization of Masonry, all according to a conspiracy theory of history, in line with a &quot;degraded Augustinianism&quot;.

Also known for his antisemitic diatribes, by 1941 he saw the state of affairs of a world at war as follows: &quot;Spain, paladin of the Faith in Christ, is again (acting) against the true enemy: Judaism. ... Because the world, even if it does not look like it, lives in a permanent war of a religious type; it is the struggle of Christianity against Judaism. War to the death, as the fight of good against evil should be.&quot;

Carrero, who held paternalist views when assessing the Spanish presence in Africa, was hostile to the acceptance of the decolonisation process. As he declared that the Western Sahara &quot;had not ever been controlled by the Moroccan Empire&quot;, he defended that the territory was &quot;as Spanish as the province of Cuenca is&quot;.

Openly Germanophile in his articles written for the &quot;Mundo&quot; magazine during the first part of World War II, after the turn in the conflict against the Axis Powers in 1943, he modulated his hostile discourse towards the Allied Powers in those pieces; finally, after the defeat of the Axis, he had wholly replaced the message attacking the liberal democracies by a merely anti-Soviet one. A defender of the idea that the victory of the Francoist side in the Civil War had happened &quot;despite&quot; an alleged international conspiracy against the former, years later, in the 1950s, he insisted again: &quot;this is precisely the Spanish problem, Spain wants to implement the Good, and the forces of Evil, unleashed upon the world, try to prevent her from doing it&quot;.

He was reportedly among the endorsers of the so-called &quot;Proyecto Islero&quot;, an alleged secret plan to develop a nuclear weapon for Spain.

Regarding the future of a post-Franco Spain, Carrero, along with López Rodó, envisaged and promoted the idea of an authoritarian monarchy guaranteeing the continuity of Francoism.

<text>Count Duckula is a British children&#x27;s animated comedy horror television series created by British studio Cosgrove Hall Productions and produced by Thames Television as a spin-off of &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, a series in which an early version of the Count Duckula character was a recurring villain. &quot;Count Duckula&quot; aired from 6 September 1988 to 16 February 1993 across four series; in all, 65 episodes were made, each about 22 minutes long. The series aired on Disney in the United States, who billed it as its original programming. All have been released on DVD in the UK, while only the first series has been released in North America.

A new version of the original villainous Count Duckula appeared in the 2015 reboot series of &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, but being a vegetarian like the good Duckula.

==History==

&quot;Count Duckula&quot; was created by British studio Cosgrove Hall Productions as a spin-off from &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;. In 1984, Disney acquired the US broadcast rights to &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, which became a hit for the channel. After a few years, the Disney management came to Cosgrove Hall wishing to co-produce a new series. After being shown a number of ideas, the then head of Disney, Gerry Laybourne, spotted a picture of Count Duckula in Brian Cosgrove&#x27;s office, and said, &quot;That&#x27;s the one I want&quot;. As the series went into production, one of the writers suggested he become a vegetarian, which added an even sillier concept to the series.

==Plot==
Several episodes explore the theme that each resurrection creates a new incarnation with little to no memory of its past life, the immediate past incarnation referred to as the current&#x27;s &quot;father&quot;. Thus, every incarnation is free to develop its own personality and pursue its own personal interests. The vampire is able to pose as a &quot;dreadful dynasty, the counts of Duckula&quot;. The preceding generations included knights, sorcerers, scientists, artists, Egyptologists and even professional gamblers, all of whom are also secretly &quot;vicious vampire ducks&quot;.

As the title sequence puts it, &quot;the latest reincarnation did not run according to plan&quot;. The successful conclusion of the ritual, which was to be performed &quot;once a century, when the moon is in the 8th house of Aquarius&quot;, requires blood, the source of sustenance for any vampire, but Nanny accidentally substitutes ketchup. Consequently, the newest version is not a blood-sucking vampire, but a vegetarian one. He is more interested in juicy carrots than hunting for victims. Igor is appalled. Even worse, his &quot;new&quot; master is obsessed with pursuing wealth and fame as an entertainer.

The stories often revolve around Duckula&#x27;s adventures in search of riches and fame, assisted by the castle&#x27;s ability to teleport around the world. Another regularly occurring theme is the repeated attempt by Igor to turn Duckula into a proper vampire. Some episodes feature Duckula&#x27;s Doctor Von Goosewing (based on Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, the nemesis of Dracula), a vampire hunter who blindly refuses to believe the current incarnation of Duckula is harmless. There is also an array of bizarre, often supernatural foes, from zombies to mechanical werewolves. Another feature of the show is a cuckoo clock whose bat-like Borscht Belt comedian styled characters come out and make jokes about the current situation (or corny jokes in general). The clock is also a vital part of the castle&#x27;s traveling mechanism, and it even has the ability to turn back time.

A series of annuals and monthly comics further detailing the adventures of Count Duckula and associated characters were released throughout the time that the series originally aired and for a short time afterwards.

==Characters==

===Count Duckula===
Count Duckula (David Jason) is a short green duck dressed in typical vampire attire (black dinner jacket, red bow tie, black cape) with black parted hair and speaks with a thick American accent. Unlike traditional vampires, Duckula is a vegetarian, as an unintended consequence of his resurrection ritual being erroneously conducted with tomato ketchup in place of blood. As such, he does not possess the fangs typically associated with vampires, and his favourite food is broccoli sandwiches.

He has a very modern outlook, and often despairs over the traditional vampire image he is expected to embody. He hates living in a dark, gloomy castle, and finds the behaviour of his servants to be depressing. Duckula frequently expresses frustration with Igor&#x27;s attempts to change him back into a proper vampire and his lecturing Duckula as a disgrace and disappointment to the Duckula lineage. Although he retains some vampiric powers and qualities (such as teleportation and an image invisible to mirrors), he also possesses a lesser power, seen only once, which is the ability to create a lightning flash when angry. He often goes outside in the daytime without suffering any ill effects, but this is likely because of his not being a fully &quot;traditional&quot; vampire. In the episode &quot;Doctor Goosewing and Mr. Duck&quot;, Count Duckula briefly turns into a &quot;proper&quot; vampire, desiring blood from the villagers outside the castle (much to Igor&#x27;s great delight), due to a serum slipped to him by von Goosewing that he presumed would make Duckula harmless, but he turns away from the door when he discovers that the sun is still out and is returned to normal by night.

Duckula&#x27;s personality is good-natured and caring, always trying to help the villagers in need, often with mixed results. Despite his nobility, inherited castle, and devoted staff, he is often destitute to the point of being penniless, with several episodes pointing out that he struggles to pay essentials (such as claiming that he hasn&#x27;t been able to pay his light bill since the day he was resurrected). As a result of being perpetually broke, Count Duckula is prone to short-lived obsessions, usually in order to become rich and famous. These obsessions form the plots for episodes, such as attempting to become a blues musician in New Orleans or prospecting for gold.

The character differs considerably from his predecessor on the &quot;Danger Mouse&quot; series. The only similarity, other than the name, is they are both vampire ducks with ambitions in show business and little actual talent. The previous version was an evil villain, willing to blackmail and force his way into stardom (as opposed to the current Count, who merely tries to get in the legitimate way) and was fixated on being a TV star, rather than settle for fame in some other branch of entertainment. The original depiction of Duckula has far greater magical powers and makes more common use of them. He has a thick accent consisting of lisping, stuttering and occasional squawks. Most notably, he was not a vegetarian in the &quot;Danger Mouse&quot; version. In his very first appearance, he threatened to drink Danger Mouse&#x27;s blood, only to be chased away by the sun. The &quot;Danger Mouse&quot; Duckula was destroyed and fell to ashes, resurrected during the 8th astronomical house of Aquarius. During his recent appearance in the 2015 reboot, the new Duckula is a mix of the original and the vegetarian version from his spin-off.

===Igor===
Igor, the Count&#x27;s butler, is a traditional horror servant based on the stock character Igor, and adds a decidedly dark streak to some of the show&#x27;s humour. He greatly dislikes his master&#x27;s behaviour, and often encourages him to act in a far more ghastly manner. Although he will generally obey Duckula&#x27;s specific orders, he remains convinced that, if he could only talk Duckula into biting, maiming, torturing and otherwise brutalising people, he would return to the &quot;good old days&quot; of the previous counts who behaved more like evil vampires. Igor hates words such as &quot;bless you&quot;, &quot;nice&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, and &quot;lovely&quot;. Such words make him cringe, since he prefers the darker and more sinister side of life. In &quot;Dr Goosewing and Mr Duck&quot; when he accidentally drinks the carpet stain removal liquid created by Goosewing, his personality changes to an overly sweet-natured demeanour, and he becomes eager to help Goosewing destroy Duckula.

He is a hunched, balding, cultured vulture with a deep, slow voice and delights in the macabre. In the episode &quot;Arctic Circles&quot;, he states that he has served for &quot;seven-and-a-half centuries&quot;, indicating that Igor is himself either immortal, or extremely long-lived through some unknown means. It is unknown if the 7.5 centuries constitutes the totality of the 17-count Duckula dynasty, or if Igor has only served the most recent few incarnations. The episode &quot;Dear Diary&quot; implies that the Duckula dynasty is in excess of 2,000 years old, by stating that exposure to sunlight would fry the extant count into &quot;a 2,000-year-old pile of dust.&quot; However the episode &quot;The Rest is History&quot; contradicts this, by implying that not only has Igor indeed been with the dynasty since the very first Count Duckula, he is also responsible for the first count becoming a vampire, as a figure who is virtually identical to the modern Igor of the show in both appearance and voice conspires to have the first Duckula be bitten by a bat. The exact reasons for this are unknown, however his attempts are ultimately successful, much to the chagrin of the modern Duckula.

===Nanny===
Nanny is Duckula&#x27;s nanny and housekeeper. She is an extremely large and clumsy hen with a very strong Bristolian accent and her right arm inexplicably always in a sling, possessing incredible strength and inevitably messing up whatever task she is set to do. The episode &quot;No Sax Please, We&#x27;re Egyptian&quot; reveals that Nanny&#x27;s clumsiness actually resulted in the death of three former chambermaids and a footman of Castle Duckula, though this happenstance is quickly dismissed by the characters as they were only part-time employees. Nanny has a blind spot regarding doors, and often crashes through a door without opening it first, or (more commonly) walks right through the wall a few feet off from the door&#x27;s position. Not surprisingly, she is the one who mistakes ketchup for blood in Duckula&#x27;s current resurrection. The episode &quot;Prime Time Duck&quot; reveals her first name to be Amnesia. Nanny may herself also be immortal, as—in the episode &quot;Dear Diary&quot;—she&#x27;s seen alongside Igor, serving the Count&#x27;s great-grandfather, in a flashback set more than a century prior to the show&#x27;s present day.

She is supremely unintelligent, completely unreliable, but utterly devoted to her &quot;Ducky-boos,&quot; as she calls Duckula, and has a deep maternal affection for him, although her clumsiness often inadvertently causes him harm. A recurring gag is her inability to understand what people around her are talking about. She often mixes up words and takes insult at conversations not directed at her. In &quot;Dr Goosewing and Mr Duck&quot; when she accidentally drinks the carpet stain removal liquid created by Goosewing, she becomes extremely intelligent.

===Castle Duckula===
Count Duckula&#x27;s home is an archetypal Transylvanian castle with all the trimmings: dungeon, torture chamber, library of macabre texts, laboratory, and more. The castle is also home to an often referred-to, but never seen, werewolf named Towser, which Duckula does not believe exists (he often refers to it as &quot;the werewolf we don&#x27;t have&quot;). The castle can teleport to any place on earth (and beyond), but returns automatically at dawn, &quot;Eastern Transylvanian Standard Time&quot;. The teleportation is activated when Duckula enters an upright coffin while he states where he wants it to take him (often, he will have to come up with a rhyme to activate it properly). The controls to this device are inside an old-fashioned cuckoo clock that hangs on the wall. The controls have two live mechanical bats, Dmitri and Sviatoslav, who are known for bad puns and jokes. Duckula himself, throughout the entire series never notices them, except in the episode &quot;The Rest is History&quot; where he says their jokes are terrible, although he did find them talking backwards when turning the hands of the clock back when travelling back in time hilarious.

===Dr. Von Goosewing===
Dr. Von Goosewing is a mad scientist and vampire hunter, a spoof of Abraham Van Helsing. He is a goose that speaks in a German accent, and wears an outfit not unlike that of Sherlock Holmes. He pursues Count Duckula relentlessly, never able to comprehend that Duckula is actually completely harmless. He is a terrible scientist, often getting maimed by his own crackpot inventions, he is supremely unobservant, and often bumps into Duckula and converses with him for several minutes without realizing to whom he is speaking.

Goosewing appears to have an assistant named Heinrich (he never appears on screen), whom he often calls out and blames his failures on him. In fact, &quot;Heinrich&quot; appears to be just a figment of Goosewing&#x27;s imagination, an imaginary friend. However, the comic book version of the characters by Marvel reveal that Heinrich is actually his former assistant who is always complaining about his paltry wages.

The Marvel Comics run also introduced Vanna Von Goosewing, who was stated to be Von Goosewing&#x27;s niece. Vanna and Duckula&#x27;s reciprocal romance further infuriated Goosewing, as he now believed that Vanna was under some form of mental manipulation, assuming it to be the only reason she would have any interest in Duckula. This belief made him all the more intent on destroying Duckula as he now considered his mission to have a personal component to it, believing Duckula to be a threat to Vanna&#x27;s safety. In an alternate universe depicted in the final issue of the comic, Goosewing is stated to have &quot;succeeded&quot; in destroying the counterpart Duckula of that reality, indicating it to be the reason why the &#x27;regular&#x27; Duckula of the series had no reflection, and leaving Igor and Nanny without anyone to serve until the next time the resurrection ritual could be performed.

===The Crow Brothers===
The Crow Brothers are four criminally-inclined crows named Ruffles, Burt, Junior, and the masked brother (according to a comic in a &quot;Count Duckula&quot; annual). They typically scale the walls of Castle Duckula with the aid of climbing equipment. They are always seen hanging off one another with the use of bungee cords to climb the walls of whatever building they plan to scale. Their goal is to get at the treasure inside the castle, but they will rarely make it to the top.

===Gaston and Pierre===
Gaston and Pierre are a pair of French criminals and occasional villains. Although they are both undeniably incompetent, the arrogant Gaston is ostensibly the &quot;brains&quot; of the outfit. Gaston is a tall, thin, black stork, while Pierre is a short, stubby parakeet who sounds similar to Bluebottle from &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. The characters were adapted into non-bird form for yet another Cosgrove-Hall animated series, &quot;Victor and Hugo&quot;.

===Pirate Penguins===
A ruthless crew of piratical penguins originally hired by Count Duckula, this crew of seafarers turn on Count Duckula when his antics crash their ship. All of the penguins are typical pirate stereotypes, one of which is known as Mr. Mate and shouts that he will &quot;bite their heads off!&quot;

===Narrator===

The Narrator (Barry Clayton) opens and closes every episode. Episodes usually began with him describing Castle Duckula and its gloomy atmosphere, and close with him saying a phrase popularised in the 1950s and 1960s by American TV horror host John Zacherle, &quot;Goodnight out there ... WHATever you are!&quot; The Narrator finishes with evil laughter that leads into the end credits. Variants of The Narrator&#x27;s closing line are also used to close certain programmes.

===Relatives===
Duckula has numerous vampiric relatives all over the world, who are more classic vampires than Duckula, possessing fangs, red eyes and evil personalities. Only a small number, such as Don Diego, show any affinity or friendship toward the benign Count Duckula.

They come from many different countries, such as Spain and Scotland, and their costumes represent their native cultures. The relatives include Don Diego, a Spanish vampire duck who makes his fun and games by burning down villages, and Rory McDuckula, a Scottish vampire duck who later makes himself an enemy of Duckula. Another relative, the Archduck Merganser, was a famous Egyptologist. &quot;Uncle Bloodbath&quot; is also mentioned a few times.

===The Peasants===

The town situated below Castle Duckula is home to many peasants who live in constant fear of the count, despite his harmless current incarnation. A recurring joke in the series and associated books is that &quot;the peasants are revolting&quot;. Their local pub is called The Tooth and Jugular. The regulars are often seen singing a variation of the traditional song &quot;One Man Went to Mow a Meadow!&quot; replacing the words &quot;mow a meadow&quot; with &quot;kill a vampire&quot;.

===Towser===

Towser is the werewolf kept secretly in the dungeons of Castle Duckula. Never seen on-screen, he is sometimes heard howling and growling off-screen. This frequently leads to Igor denying Towser&#x27;s existence in the castle to the ever-suspicious Duckula who has never seen the werewolf.

==Episodes==

==Spin-off==

In a move mirroring Duckula&#x27;s adaptation from &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, the characters of Gaston and Pierre were reinvented and given a spinoff series as the now-human &quot;Victor &amp; Hugo: Bunglers in Crime&quot;.

==Home media==
===DVD releases===
The &quot;Count Duckula&quot; discs are in Region 0, PAL format. The first series was released on Region 1 DVD on 4 October 2005. Series 2, 3, and 4 have, as of 2025, not been released in North America. A Spanish format for Latin America was released.

The entire 65 episodes of the series are set to be released on UK DVD on June 3, 2024. This appears to be the first time ever the whole series have been available on English-language DVD&#x27;s.

===VHS releases===
During the show&#x27;s original run, &quot;Count Duckula&quot; episodes were released on numerous VHS titles from Thames Video collection, often in a different sequence than what was shown in the TV.

This VHS title appeared in 1990 but, at the time, the episodes contained were somewhat exclusive to video (the first was not televised until 1991, neither was the latter until 1993).

&quot;Count Duckula&quot; episodes were also released on special VHS compilations with episodes of other series. In 1989, the episode &quot;Down under Duckula&quot; was released on Thames&#x27; VHS title &quot;More Children&#x27;s Summer Stories&quot;, with episodes from &quot;Danger Mouse&quot; and &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;. In 2001, in the twilight years of VHS, the episodes &quot;The Ghost of Castle McDuckula&quot; and &quot;Venice a Duck, Not a Duck!&quot; were featured on two &quot;Cult Kids&quot; collection tapes, with episodes of &quot;Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Chorlton and the Wheelies&quot;, &quot;Button Moon&quot;, &quot;Jamie and the Magic Torch&quot; and The Sooty Show.

===Comics===
Between 1988 and 1991 Marvel Comics distributed 15 issues of &quot;Count Duckula&quot; comics.

Count Duckula appeared in North American comics under Star Comics (an imprint of Marvel Comics) and introduced an additional difference between this incarnation of Duckula which separated him from his predecessors. Due to ketchup being used in the resurrection ceremony, this version of Duckula has &quot;ketchup&quot;, rather than blood, flowing through his veins. This was discovered when Duckula was given a blood test in order to get a passport into a fictional country which produced a salad which Duckula was obsessed with getting to eat. In the same issue, Duckula, Nanny, and Igor were photographed as a means of formal ID for said country; however, due to the classic stereotype of vampires not appearing in film, Duckula did not appear in the photo which was taken. Duckula also gained a romantic interest in the Star Comics run; Vanna Von Goosewing, who turned out to be the niece of his long time adversary Dr. Von Goosewing. The attraction was mutual, and the two continued their relationship through the majority of the series after their introduction, though Vanna didn&#x27;t always appear in every issue of the book.

In Germany, a separate adaptation was produced under license as &quot;Graf Duckula&quot;, with script by Peter Mennigen and artwork by Miroslava Pollmer and Rüdiger Pareike.

===Audiobooks===
In the early 1990s at least two episodes were released in audiobook format on cassette tape with accompanying illustrated hardcover book featuring artwork from the original television episodes. They featured the original cast in new performances as they were edited considerably from the original television scripts for a shorter duration, removal of visual gags and the addition of new narration and character exposition where necessary. The &quot;Restoration Comedy&quot; episode was packaged with a small plastic Count Duckula figure in some territories.

* No Sax Please, We&#x27;re Egyptian
* Restoration Comedy
* The Ghost of Castle McDuckula

===Computer games===
Alternative Software released a computer game based on &quot;Count Duckula&quot; called &quot;No Sax Please, We&#x27;re Egyptian!&quot;. In the game, Igor, Nanny and Count Duckula have decided to search the tomb of the great Pharaoh Upanatem (a pun on &quot;up and at &#x27;em&quot;) to find the mystic saxophone. What they do not know is that they have brought along some unwanted guests in the form of the Crow brothers.

The game was a basic jump and run platform-type game. At the start, the castle was transported to an ancient pyramid. Then, players had a set amount of time to go through the pyramid, evading the various baddies inside the pyramid, to retrieve the mystic sax before the Count&#x27;s castle automatically returns to Transylvania, leaving the player stranded in Egypt.

The title of the game was a parody on the title of a British comedy play &quot;No Sex Please, We&#x27;re British!&quot;.

The game was available for various 8-bit computers such as the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, &amp; Amstrad CPC, and was also released as a &quot;Kid&#x27;s Pack&quot; with other TV shows that Alternative Software turned into games, including &quot;Postman Pat&quot;, &quot;Sooty and Sweep&quot;, &quot;Popeye 2&quot;, &quot;The Wombles&quot;, and &quot;SuperTed&quot;. Alternative Software was one of the few software companies of the 1980s that still survives today as an independent software producer.

There was also a &quot;Count Duckula 2&quot; sequel in 1992.

<text>Ian Nicholas Stewart (born 24 September 1945) is a British mathematician and a popular-science and science-fiction writer. He is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Warwick, England.

==Education and early life==
Stewart was born in 1945 in Folkestone, England. While in the sixth form at Harvey Grammar School in Folkestone he came to the attention of the mathematics teacher. The teacher had Stewart sit mock A-level examinations without any preparation along with the upper-sixth students; Stewart was placed first in the examination. He was awarded a scholarship to study at the University of Cambridge as an undergraduate student of Churchill College, Cambridge, where he studied the Mathematical Tripos and obtained a first-class Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1966. Stewart then went to the University of Warwick where his PhD on Lie algebras was supervised by Brian Hartley and completed in 1969.

==Career and research==
After his PhD, Stewart was offered an academic position at Warwick. He is well known for his popular expositions of mathematics and his contributions to catastrophe theory.

While at Warwick, Stewart edited the mathematical magazine &quot;Manifold&quot;. He also wrote a column called &quot;Mathematical Recreations&quot; for &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine from 1991 to 2001. This followed the work of past columnists like Martin Gardner, Douglas Hofstadter, and A. K. Dewdney. Altogether, he wrote 96 columns for &quot;Scientific American&quot;, which were later reprinted in the books &quot;Math Hysteria&quot;, &quot;How to Cut a Cake: And Other Mathematical Conundrums&quot; and &quot;Cows in the Maze&quot;.

Stewart has held visiting academic positions in Germany (1974), New Zealand (1976), and the US (University of Connecticut 1977–78, University of Houston 1983–84).

Stewart has published more than 140 scientific papers, including a series of influential papers co-authored with Jim Collins on coupled oscillators and the symmetry of animal gaits.

Stewart has collaborated with Jack Cohen and Terry Pratchett on four popular science books based on Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot;. In 1999 Terry Pratchett made both Jack Cohen and Professor Ian Stewart &quot;Honorary Wizards of the Unseen University&quot; at the same ceremony at which the University of Warwick gave Terry Pratchett an honorary degree.

In March 2014 Ian Stewart&#x27;s iPad app, Incredible Numbers by Professor Ian Stewart, launched in the App Store. The app was produced in partnership with Profile Books and Touch Press.

<text>Phantom power, in the context of professional audio equipment, is DC electric power equally applied to both signal wires in balanced microphone cables, forming a phantom circuit, to operate microphones that contain active electronic circuitry.
It is best known as a convenient power source for condenser microphones, though many active direct boxes also use it. The technique is also used in other applications where power supply and signal communication take place over the same wires.

Phantom power supplies are often built into mixing consoles, microphone preamplifiers and similar equipment. In addition to powering the circuitry of a microphone, traditional condenser microphones also use phantom power for polarizing the microphone&#x27;s transducer element.

==History==
Phantom powering was first used for landline copper wire-based plain old telephone service since the introduction of the rotary dial telephone in 1919. One such application in the telephone system was to provide a DC signalling path around transformer-connected amplifiers such as analogue line transmission systems. 

The first known commercially available phantom-powered microphone was the Schoeps model CMT 20, which came out in 1964, built to the specifications of French radio with 9–12 volt DC phantom power; the positive pole of this powering was grounded. Microphone preamplifiers of the Nagra IV-series tape recorders offered this type of powering as an option for many years and Schoeps continued to support &quot;negative phantom&quot; until the CMT series was discontinued in the mid-1970s, but it is obsolete now.

In 1966, Neumann GmbH presented a new type of transistorized microphone to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, NRK. Norwegian Radio had requested phantom-powered operation. Since NRK already had 48-volt power available in their studios for their emergency lighting systems, this voltage was used for powering the new microphones (model KM 84), and is the origin of 48-volt phantom power. This arrangement was later standardized in DIN 45596.

==Standards==
The International Electrotechnical Commission Standards Committee&#x27;s &quot;Multimedia systems – Guide to the recommended characteristics of analogue interfaces to achieve interoperability&quot; (IEC 61938:2018) specifies parameters for microphone phantom power delivery. Three variants are defined by the document: P12, P24 and P48. In addition, two additional variants (P12L and SP48) are mentioned for specialized applications. Most microphones now use the P48 standard (maximum available power is 240 mW). Although 12 and 48-volt systems are still in use, the standard recommends a 24-volt supply for new systems.

==Technical information==


Phantom powering consists of a phantom circuit where direct current is applied equally through the two signal lines of a balanced audio connector (in modern equipment, both pins 2 and 3 of an XLR connector). The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally is connected to the cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. When phantom powering was introduced, one of its advantages was that the same type of balanced, shielded microphone cable that studios were already using for dynamic microphones could be used for condenser microphones. This is in contrast to microphones with vacuum-tube circuitry, most of which require special, multi-conductor cables.

With phantom power, the supply voltage is effectively invisible to balanced microphones that do not use it, which includes most dynamic microphones. A balanced signal consists only of the differences in voltage between two signal lines; phantom powering places the same DC voltage on both signal lines of a balanced connection. This is in marked contrast to another, slightly earlier method of powering known as &quot;parallel powering&quot; or &quot;T-powering&quot; (from the German term &quot;Tonaderspeisung&quot;), in which DC was overlaid directly onto the signal in differential mode. Connecting a conventional microphone to an input that had parallel powering enabled could very well damage the microphone.

The IEC 61938 Standard defines 48-volt, 24-volt, and 12-volt phantom powering. The signal conductors are positive, both fed through resistors of equal value (6.81 kΩ for 48 V, 1.2 kΩ for 24 V, and 680 Ω for 12 V), and the shield is ground. The 6.81 kΩ value is not critical, but the resistors must be matched to within 0.1% or better to maintain good common-mode rejection in the circuit. The 24-volt version of phantom powering, proposed quite a few years after the 12 and 48 V versions, was also included in the DIN standard and is in the IEC standard, but it was never widely adopted by equipment manufacturers.

Nearly all modern mixing consoles have a switch for turning phantom power on or off; in most high-end equipment this can be done individually by channel, while on smaller mixers a single master switch may control power delivery to all channels. Phantom power can be blocked in any channel with a 1:1 isolation transformer or blocking capacitors. Phantom powering can cause equipment malfunction or even damage if used with cables or adapters that connect one side of the input to ground, or if certain equipment other than microphones is connected to it.

Instrument amplifiers rarely provide phantom power. To use equipment requiring it with these amplifiers, a separate power supply must be inserted into the line. These are readily available commercially, or alternatively are one of the easier projects for the amateur electronics constructor.

==Caveats==
Some microphones offer a choice of internal battery powering or (external) phantom powering. In some such microphones, it is advisable to remove the internal batteries when phantom power is being used since batteries may corrode and leak chemicals. Other microphones are specifically designed to switch over to the internal batteries if an external supply fails.

Phantom powering is not always implemented correctly or adequately, even in professional-quality preamps, mixers, and recorders. In part, this is because first-generation (late-1960s through mid-1970s) 48-volt phantom-powered condenser microphones had simple circuitry and required only small amounts of operating current (typically less than 1 mA per microphone), so the phantom supply circuits typically built into recorders, mixers, and preamps of that time were designed on the assumption that this current would be adequate. The original DIN 45596 phantom-power specification called for a maximum of 2 mA. This practice has carried forward to the present; many 48-volt phantom power supply circuits, especially in low-cost and portable equipment, simply cannot supply more than 1 or 2 mA total without breaking down. Some circuits also have significant additional resistance in series with the standard pair of supply resistors for each microphone input; this may not affect low-current microphones much, but it can disable microphones that need more current.

Mid-1970s and later condenser microphones designed for 48-volt phantom powering often require much more current (e.g., 2–4 mA for Neumann transformerless microphones, 4–5 mA for the Schoeps CMC (&quot;Colette&quot;) series and Josephson microphones, 5–6 mA for most Shure KSM-series microphones, 8 mA for CAD Equiteks and 10 mA for Earthworks). The IEC standard gives 10 mA as the maximum allowed current per microphone. If its required current is not available, a microphone may still put out a signal, but it cannot deliver its intended level of performance. The specific symptoms vary somewhat, but the most common result will be reduction of the maximum sound pressure level that the microphone can handle without overload (distortion). Some microphones will also show lower sensitivity (output level for a given sound-pressure level).

Most ground lift switches have the unwanted effect of disconnecting phantom power. There must always be a DC current path between pin 1 of the microphone and the negative side of the 48-volt supply if power is to reach the microphone&#x27;s electronics. Lifting the ground, which is normally pin 1, breaks this path and disables the phantom power supply.

There is a common belief that connecting a dynamic or ribbon microphone to a phantom-powered input will damage it. There are three possibilities for this damage to occur. If there is a fault in the cable, phantom power may damage some mics by applying a voltage across the output of the microphone. Equipment damage is also possible if a phantom-powered input connected to an unbalanced dynamic microphone or electronic musical instruments. The transient generated when a microphone is hot-plugged into an input with active phantom power can damage the microphone and possibly the preamp circuit of the input because not all pins of the microphone connector make contact at the same time, and there is an instant when current can flow to charge the capacitance of the cable from one side of the phantom-powered input and not the other. This is particularly a problem with long microphone cables. It is considered good practice to disable phantom power to devices that don&#x27;t require it.

==Digital phantom power==
Digital microphones complying with the AES 42 standard may be provided with phantom power at 10 volts, impressed on both audio leads and ground. This supply can furnish up to 250 mA to digital microphones. A keyed variation of the usual XLR connector, the XLD connector, may be used to prevent accidental interchange of analog and digital devices.

==Other microphone powering techniques==
T-power, also known as A-B powering or T12, described in DIN 45595, is an alternative to phantom powering that is still widely used in the world of production film sound. Many mixers and recorders intended for that market have a T-power option. The method is considered obsolete as power supply noise is added to the output audio signal. Many older Sennheiser and Schoeps microphones use this powering method, although newer recorders and mixers are phasing out this option. Adapter barrels, and dedicated power supplies, are made to accommodate T-powered microphones. In this scheme, 12volts is applied through 180ohm resistors between the microphone&#x27;s &quot;hot&quot; terminal (XLR pin 2) and the microphone&#x27;s &quot;cold&quot; terminal (XLR pin 3). This results in a 12-volt potential difference with significant current capability across pins 2 and 3, which would likely cause permanent damage if applied to a dynamic or ribbon microphone.

Plug-in-power (PiP) is the low-current 3–5 V supply provided at the microphone jack of some consumer equipment, such as portable recorders and computer sound cards. It is also defined in IEC 61938. It is unlike phantom power since it is an unbalanced interface with a low voltage (around +5volts) connected to the signal conductor with return through the sleeve; the DC power is in common with the audio signal from the microphone. A capacitor is used to block the DC from subsequent audio frequency circuits. It is often used for powering electret microphones, which will not function without power. It is suitable only for powering microphones specifically designed for use with this type of power supply. Damage may result if these microphones are connected to true (48 V) phantom power through a 3.5 mm to XLR adapter that connects the XLR shield to the 3.5 mm sleeve. Plug-in-power is covered by Japanese standard CP-1203A:2007.

These alternative powering schemes are sometimes improperly referred to as &quot;phantom power&quot; and should not be confused with true 48-volt phantom powering described above.

Some condenser microphones can be powered with a 1.5-volt cell contained in a small compartment in the microphone or in an external housing.

Phantom power is sometimes used by workers in avionics to describe the DC bias voltage used to power aviation microphones, which use a lower voltage than professional audio microphones. Phantom power used in this context is 8–16volts DC in series with a 470ohm (nominal) resistor as specified in RTCA Inc. standard DO-214. These microphones evolved from the carbon microphones used in the early days of aviation and the telephone which relied on a DC bias voltage across the carbon microphone element.
