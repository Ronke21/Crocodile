<text>Eric Marlon Bishop (born December 13, 1967), known professionally as Jamie Foxx, is an American actor, comedian, and singer. He gained his career breakthrough as a featured player in the sketch comedy show &quot;In Living Color&quot; from 1991 to 1994. Following this success, he was given his own sitcom, &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot;, in which he starred, co-created and produced from 1996 to 2001.

Foxx received acclaim for his portrayal of Ray Charles in the film &quot;Ray&quot; (2004), winning the Academy Award for Best Actor. That same year, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the crime film &quot;Collateral&quot;. He gained further prominence for his film roles in &quot;Ali&quot; (2001), &quot;Jarhead&quot; (2005), &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; (2006), &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (2006), &quot;Horrible Bosses&quot; (2011), &quot;Django Unchained&quot; (2012), &quot;Annie&quot; (2014), &quot;Baby Driver&quot; (2017), and &quot;Soul&quot; (2020). He also played Electro in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot; (2014) and &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021) and Walter McMillian in &quot;Just Mercy&quot; (2019).

Foxx also embarked on a successful career as an R&amp;B singer in the 2000s. He earned two number-one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with his features on the singles &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; by Twista alongside Kanye West, and &quot;Gold Digger&quot; by the former. His single &quot;Blame It&quot; won him the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Four of his five studio albums have charted in the top ten of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200: &quot;Unpredictable&quot; (2005), which topped the chart, &quot;Intuition&quot; (2008), &quot;Best Night of My Life&quot; (2010), and &quot;&quot; (2015). Since 2017, Foxx has served as the host and executive producer of the Fox game show &quot;Beat Shazam&quot;. In 2021, he wrote his autobiography &quot;Act Like You Got Some Sense&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born in Terrell, Texas, Foxx is the son of Darrell Bishop (renamed Shahid Abdula following his conversion to Islam), who sometimes worked as a stockbroker, and Louise Annette Talley Dixon. Shortly after his birth, Foxx was adopted and raised by his mother&#x27;s adoptive parents, Esther Marie (née Nelson), a domestic worker and nursery operator, and Mark Talley, a yard worker. He has had little contact with his birth parents, who were not part of his upbringing. He was raised in the black quarter of Terrell, which at the time was a racially segregated community. He has often acknowledged his grandmother&#x27;s influence as one of the greatest reasons for his success.

Foxx began playing the piano when he was five years old. He had a strict Baptist upbringing and as a teenager was a part-time pianist and choir leader in Terrell&#x27;s New Hope Baptist Church. His natural talent for telling jokes was already in evidence as a third grader, when his teacher used him as a reward: if the class behaved well, Foxx would tell them jokes. He attended Terrell High School, where he received top grades and played basketball and football (as quarterback). His ambition was to play for the Dallas Cowboys, and he was the first player in the school&#x27;s history to pass for more than 1,000 yards. He also sang in a band called Leather and Lace. After high school, Foxx received a scholarship to United States International University, where he studied musical and performing arts composition.

==Career==

===1989–2003: Standup, sitcom, and acting debut ===
Foxx first told jokes at a comedy club&#x27;s open mic night in 1989, after accepting a girlfriend&#x27;s dare. When he found that female comedians were often called first to perform, he chose the stage name of Jamie Foxx, which he felt was ambiguous enough to disallow any biases, with his surname being a tribute to the black comedian Redd Foxx. Foxx joined the cast of &quot;In Living Color&quot; in 1991, where his recurrent character Wanda also shared a name with Redd&#x27;s friend and co-worker, LaWanda Page. Following a recurring role in the comedy-drama sitcom &quot;Roc&quot;, Foxx went on to star in his own sitcom &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot;, from 1996 to 2001, which he also co-created and produced through his company Foxx Hole Productions and was aired on the WB network.

Foxx made his film debut in the 1992 comedy &quot;Toys&quot;. His first dramatic role came in Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, where he was cast as a hard-partying quarterback, partly because of his own football background. During filming, Foxx fought with costar LL Cool J.

In 2001, Foxx starred opposite Will Smith in Michael Mann&#x27;s biographical drama &quot;Ali&quot;. Three years later, Foxx played taxi driver Max Durocher in the Mann film &quot;Collateral&quot; alongside Tom Cruise, for which he received outstanding reviews. Critic Roger Ebert praised Foxx&#x27;s performance, stating that, &quot;Jamie Foxx&#x27;s work is a revelation. I&#x27;ve thought of him in terms of comedy (&quot;Booty Call&quot;, &quot;Breakin&#x27; all the Rules&quot;), but here he steps into a dramatic lead and is always convincing and involving&quot;. He went on to receive a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.

In 1994, Foxx released an album (on the Fox record label) entitled &quot;Peep This&quot;, which was not commercially successful. In 2003, Foxx made a cameo in Benzino&#x27;s music video for &quot;Would You&quot;, which features LisaRaye McCoy and Mario Winans.

===2003–2006: Career stardom ===

In 2003, Foxx featured on the rapper Twista&#x27;s song, &quot;Slow Jamz&quot;, together with Kanye West, which reached No. 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and #3 on the UK Singles chart. His second collaboration with Kanye West, &quot;Gold Digger&quot;, in which Foxx sang the Ray Charles-influenced &quot;I Got a Woman&quot; hook, then went straight to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, remaining there for 10 weeks. In 2005, Foxx featured on the single &quot;Georgia&quot; by Atlanta rappers Ludacris and Field Mob, which sampled Ray Charles&#x27; hit &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;.

Foxx would also portray Ray Charles in the biographical film &quot;Ray&quot; (2004), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Foxx is the third male in history (after Barry Fitzgerald and Al Pacino) to receive two acting Oscar nominations in the same year for two different movies, &quot;Collateral&quot; and &quot;Ray&quot;. In 2005, Foxx was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Foxx released his second studio album, &quot;Unpredictable&quot;, in December 2005. It debuted at No. 2, selling 598,000 copies in its first week, rising to No. 1 the following week and selling an additional 200,000 copies. To date, the album has sold 1.98 million copies in the United States, and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA. The album also charted on the UK Albums Chart, where it peaked at No. 9. Foxx became the fourth artist to have both won an Academy Award for an acting role and to have achieved a No. 1 album in the U.S., joining Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Barbra Streisand.

Foxx&#x27;s first single from the album, the title track &quot;Unpredictable&quot; (featuring Ludacris), peaked in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Top 10 singles and also made the UK Top 20 singles chart; the track samples &quot;Wildflower&quot; by New Birth. The second U.S. single from the album was &quot;DJ Play a Love Song&quot;, which reunited Foxx with Twista. In the UK, the second single was &quot;Extravaganza&quot;, which saw Foxx once again collaborate with Kanye West, although Foxx did not feature in the song&#x27;s music video.
At the 2006 BET Awards, Foxx won Best Duet/Collaboration with Kanye West for &quot;Gold Digger&quot; and tied with Mary J. Blige&#x27;s &quot;Be Without You&quot; for Video of the Year. On December 8, 2006, Foxx received four Grammy Award nominations, which included Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for &quot;Love Changes&quot; featuring Mary J. Blige, Best R&amp;B Album for &quot;Unpredictable&quot;, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;Georgia&quot; by Ludacris &amp; Field Mob featuring Jamie Foxx, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for &quot;Unpredictable&quot; featuring Ludacris.

Following on from these successes, Foxx went on to appear in the box-office hits &quot;Jarhead&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, and &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, which lifted his profile even higher as a bankable star in Hollywood.

===2007–2009: &quot;Intuition&quot; ===

2007 brought him the lead role in the action thriller film &quot;The Kingdom&quot; opposite Chris Cooper, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner and Ashraf Barhom. In September 2007, Foxx was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: &quot;[it was] one of the most amazing days of my life,&quot; said Foxx. In April 2009, Foxx played the lead role in the dramatic film &quot;The Soloist&quot;. A few months later in October 2009, he played a starring role alongside Gerard Butler in the thriller &quot;Law Abiding Citizen&quot;. In 2007, his company FoxxKing Entertainment signed deals with MTV and VH1.

Foxx released his third album titled &quot;Intuition&quot; in 2008, featuring Kanye West, T.I., Ne-Yo, Lil&#x27; Kim and T-Pain. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Just Like Me&quot; featuring T.I., was promoted by a video directed by Brett Ratner which featured an appearance by actress Taraji P. Henson. The second single &quot;Blame It&quot; featured T-Pain and became a top 5 single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and a number-one single on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The song received many accolades for Foxx, including a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. The &quot;Blame It&quot; music video, directed by Hype Williams, features cameo appearances by Forest Whitaker, Samuel L. Jackson, Ron Howard, Quincy Jones and his &quot;Jarhead&quot; co-star Jake Gyllenhaal, amongst others.

Foxx&#x27;s musical career has also included a number of collaborations. In 2007, he recorded the song &quot;She Goes All the Way&quot; with country superstars Rascal Flatts for their &quot;Still Feels Good&quot; album. Foxx performed backing vocals for artist/songwriter Tank. He featured alongside The-Dream on Plies&#x27; &quot;Please Excuse My Hands&quot;. He also appeared alongside Fabolous on the remix of Ne-Yo&#x27;s &quot;Miss Independent&quot;. Foxx collaborated with rapper The Game on the track &quot;Around the World&quot;. Foxx also featured on T.I.&#x27;s single &quot;Live in the Sky&quot; from the album &quot;King&quot;.

On January 22, 2007, Foxx launched The Foxxhole, a channel on Sirius Satellite Radio featuring talk-radio programs, stand-up comedy albums and music primarily by African-American performers, as well as much of Foxx&#x27;s own material. Foxx&#x27;s own talk-radio variety program &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot; airs Friday evenings on The Foxxhole with guests including musicians, actors and fellow comedians; co-hosts have included Johnny Mack, Speedy, Claudia Jordan, The Poetess, Lewis Dix, Yvette Wilson, T.D.P and Tyrin Turner. On the April 17, 2009, episode of &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot;, Foxx and his co-hosts made several sexually suggestive and disparaging jokes regarding the teenage singer Miley Cyrus. Several days later Foxx issued a public apology on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; in response to growing public outcry and televised criticism by Cyrus&#x27;s father, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus.

On April 6, 2009, Foxx, a longtime fan of country music, performed the George Strait song &quot;You Look So Good in Love&quot; at the George Strait Artist of the Decade All-Star Concert. Jamie Foxx hosted the 2009 BET Awards ceremony on June 28, 2009, which featured several tributes to pop star Michael Jackson, who had died three days prior to the show. As well as performing &quot;Blame It&quot; with T-Pain and &quot;She Got Her Own&quot; with Ne-Yo and Fabolous, Foxx opened the show with a rendition of Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Beat It&quot; dance routine and closed the show with a cover of the Jackson 5&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; with Ne-Yo. &quot;We want to celebrate this black man. He belongs to us and we shared him with everybody else.&quot;, said Foxx during the ceremony.

===2010–2012: Career progression ===
In April 2011, Foxx voiced the cartoon canary Nico in the movie &quot;Rio&quot;. During the summer of 2011, Foxx was involved as a producer of &quot;In the Flow with Affion Crockett&quot; on Fox.

Foxx released his fourth album, &quot;Best Night of My Life&quot;, on December 21, 2010, featuring the singles &quot;Winner&quot; (featuring Justin Timberlake and T.I.), &quot;Living Better Now&quot; (featuring rapper Rick Ross) and &quot;Fall for Your Type&quot; (featuring rapper Drake). On October 7, the RCA Music Group announced that it was disbanding J Records along with Arista Records and Jive Records, meaning that all artists (including Foxx) previously signed to the three labels will release their future material on the RCA Records brand. In 2011, Jamie Foxx also featured on the rapper Pitbull&#x27;s album &quot;Planet Pit&quot;, in the song &quot;Where Do We Go&quot;.

In 2012, Foxx starred in the title role of the Quentin Tarantino written and directed &quot;Django Unchained&quot;. Foxx starred alongside his &quot;Ray&quot; co-star Kerry Washington, as well as Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. In an interview about &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, Foxx told &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine: &quot;As a black person it&#x27;s always racial. ... when I get home my other homies are like how was your day? Well, I only had to be white for at least eight hours today, [or] I only had to be white for four hours.&quot; The filming was emotional as Foxx said, &quot;It&#x27;s tough shooting when you&#x27;re in plantation row and that&#x27;s where your ancestors were persecuted and killed.&quot;

On November 25, 2012, at BET&#x27;s &quot;Soul Train Awards&quot;, Foxx joked: &quot;It&#x27;s like church in here. First of all, giving honor to God and our lord and savior Barack Obama.&quot; The joke led to condemnation from some Christians, to which Foxx responded: &quot;I&#x27;m a comic [and] sometimes I think people get a little too tight.&quot; While hosting &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on December 8, 2012, to promote &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, Foxx joked about being excited &quot;to kill all the white people in the movie&quot;. Appearing at the 2013 NAACP Image Awards, Foxx praised the achievements of black people, saying that &quot;black people are the most talented people in the world&quot;.

===2013–present: Established actor ===
In 2013, Foxx was cast as President James Sawyer in &quot;White House Down&quot; alongside Channing Tatum. The following year, Foxx appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot; as the villain Electro, and co-starred with Quvenzhané Wallis in &quot;Annie&quot;, Sony&#x27;s Will Smith and Jay-Z produced update of the comic strip-turned-musical.

Since its debut in 2017, Foxx has been the host and executive producer of the Fox game show &quot;Beat Shazam&quot;, whose premise is similar to the once-popular game show format &quot;Name That Tune&quot;. On the show, three sets of two partners try to beat the software application Shazam in correctly identifying the titles of popular songs for increasingly higher amounts of money, with one team eventually vying for a potential prize of $1 million. Foxx&#x27;s daughter Corinne began co-hosting the show in its second season in 2018, replacing DJ October Gonzalez. The show has aired four seasons so far.

Foxx co-executive produced the 2017 Showtime sitcom &quot;White Famous&quot;, which starred Jay Pharoah as a young aspiring African-American comic, and was based on Foxx&#x27;s own early career.

That September, Foxx signed an overall deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment. Foxx then voiced the main character, jazz pianist and music teacher Joe Gardner, in the Pixar animated film &quot;Soul&quot; (2020). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;Soul&quot; was released direct-to-streaming on Disney+ in most countries, including the United States, though it did get a theatrical release in some countries. &quot;USA Today&quot; Brian Truitt commended Foxx&#x27;s performance, saying he brought &quot;warmth, humor and an occasional touch of exasperation&quot; to the role.

Foxx co-created, executive produced and starred in the 2021 Netflix sitcom &quot;Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!&quot;, in which he played the single father of two teenage girls. The series marked Foxx&#x27;s return to the sitcom format after &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot; ended in 2001. The entire eight-episode series premiered April 14, 2021, on Netflix. It was cancelled after one season.

He reprised his role as Electro in &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021), set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

In 2008, Foxx filmed a public service announcement for DoSomething to promote food drives in local communities.

From 2013 to 2019, Foxx was rumored to be in a relationship with actress Katie Holmes.

On January 18, 2016, he rescued a young man from a burning vehicle that crashed outside his home. The driver, Brett Kyle, was driving his truck &quot;at a high rate of speed&quot; when it left the road, traveled into a drainage ditch, and rolled over several times. Kyle was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.

On October 26, 2020, Foxx announced that his sister Deondra Dixon had died. She was 36 years old and had been born with Down syndrome. She had been an ambassador for the Global Down Syndrome Foundation.

=== Health issues ===
On April 12, 2023, his daughter Corinne announced that he had been hospitalized after an unspecified medical emergency, but was recovering. On May 12, amid conflicting reports about the nature of his condition, including rumors that he was gravely ill, Corinne said that her father had been &quot;out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating&quot;. He was reportedly treated in a &quot;physical rehab facility in Chicago&quot; that specializes in &quot;strokes and brain injuries&quot;. On July 22, Foxx posted a video clip commenting about his health, saying that he had been to &quot;hell and back&quot;. On December 3, 2023, he made his first public appearance since the hospitalization, to accept a Critics Choice Association&#x27;s Vanguard Award. In his speech, he disclosed that he couldn&#x27;t walk at first and discussed his recovery, without detailing exactly what led to his hospitalization. Despite the news of his health challenges, he walked his daughter Corinne down the aisle in September 21, 2024 at his home in Thousand Oaks, California. On December 10, 2024, in his Netflix comedy special, &quot;Jamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was...&quot;, Foxx revealed that he had a brain bleed that led to a stroke which resulted in his hospitalization in April 2023.

===Legal issues===
On April 26, 2003, Foxx and his sister Deondra Dixon were confronted by security guards and had a physical struggle with police officers who arrested them at Harrah&#x27;s casino in New Orleans. Employees said the Foxx party failed to show identification upon entry and &quot;started yelling profanities&quot; and fought with police officers after being told to leave. Foxx&#x27;s sister was subdued by pepper spray after breaking free while being handcuffed and then using the handcuffs to strike out at the police officers. Two police officers were injured in the incident. Originally charged with trespassing, disturbing the peace, battery on police officers, and resisting arrest, Foxx pleaded no contest to disturbing the peace in exchange for the other charges being dropped and was sentenced to a six-month suspended jail term with two years of probation and a $1,500 fine.

In November 2023, Foxx was sued by a woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in 2015. Foxx has denied the alleged wrongdoing.

<doc id="325193" wikidata="Q10752171" url="?curid=325193" title="United States Office of Government Ethics">
<text>The United States Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is an independent agency within the executive branch of the U.S. Federal Government which is responsible for directing executive branch policies relating to the prevention of conflicts of interest on the part of Federal executive branch officers and employees. Under the Ethics in Government Act, this agency was originally part of the Office of Personnel Management from 1978 until it separated in 1989.

==Primary duties==
The main duties of OGE include the following:
*Establishing the standards of conduct for the executive branch; 
*Issuing rules and regulations interpreting the criminal conflict of interest restrictions; 
*Establishing the framework for the public and confidential financial disclosure systems for executive branch employees; 
*Developing training and education programs for use by executive branch ethics officials and employees; 
*Ensuring that individual agency ethics programs are functioning properly by setting the requirements for them, supporting them, and reviewing them.

==History==
Government ethics concerns in the United States were first addressed by Congress in 1853. The act, entitled &quot;An Act to prevent Frauds upon the Treasury of the United States,&quot; made it a misdemeanor for &quot;any officer of the United States&quot; or &quot;any Senator or Representative in Congress&quot; to assist in or prosecute &quot;any claim against the United States.&quot;

Ethics concerns continued to obtain during the Civil War. Theodore Roosevelt, prior to becoming Vice-President, served as United States Civil Service Commissioner under President Benjamin Harrison. He drew on this experience to help create the modern merit system (now exemplified by the United States Merit Systems Protection Board) for federal employees, as President. This, in turn, led to further developments, including the focus on ethics in Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s 1933 inaugural speech.

Following Watergate, Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 as an attempt to curb the ongoing issues with Ethics in Government.

==Office of Director==
The Director of OGE is appointed by the President after confirmation by the U.S. Senate. The Director of OGE serves a five-year term, thereby overlapping presidential terms, and is subject to no term limit. The rest of the OGE employees are career civil servants. Created by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, OGE separated from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in 1989 pursuant to reform legislation.

David Huitema was the last director of the OGE, having been sworn into office on December 16, 2024. He was removed by Donald Trump on February 10, 2025.

==Issues involving President Trump==
A series of tweets on 30 November 2016 from the office&#x27;s official Twitter account praised President-elect Donald Trump for planning to divest his business holdings in order to resolve potential conflicts of interest, following an announcement where Trump reaffirmed his intent to take himself out of business operations, despite him having made no firm commitment to a divestment like selling his businesses or a blind trust. A number of observers speculated that the office&#x27;s account might have been hacked, a suggestion it later denied. The &quot;New York Times&quot; suggested that the apparent misunderstanding behind the postings were deliberately intended to reveal the independent agency had advised Trump&#x27;s legal counsel that a divestment was the only adequate remedy for resolving any conflict, and, by extension, pressure Trump into doing so. A Freedom of Information Act request by news organization The Daily Dot revealed that OGE Director Walter M. Shaub personally ordered officials within the agency to post the nine tweets.

Under the Trump Administration, the Office reversed its own internal policy prohibiting anonymous donations from lobbyists to White House staffers who have legal defense funds.

===OGE certification of Ethics Agreement Compliance Form===
On May 11, 2017, the Office of Government Ethics requested the Trump administration and its associates submit a form regarding divestment of assets and possible conflicts of interest.

<text>Biltmore Records was a United States–based record label active from 1949 through 1951. The label was headquartered in New York City. Biltmore Records were often reissues of recordings no longer in the catalogues of other labels. When RCA Victor found out that Biltmore were making unauthorized reissues of material originally recorded by Victor, they sued Biltmore, putting Biltmore out of business.

They rereleased recordings by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra recorded for Columbia and Brunswick, Benny Goodman, the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, Duke Ellington, Bix Beiderbecke, and Paul Whiteman.

<doc id="325202" wikidata="Q449" url="?curid=325202" title="Georges Brassens">
<text>Georges Charles Brassens (; ; 22 October 1921 – 29 October 1981) was a French singer-songwriter and poet.

As an iconic figure in France, he achieved fame through his elegant songs with their harmonically complex music for voice and guitar and articulate, diverse lyrics. He is considered one of France&#x27;s most accomplished postwar poets. He has also set to music poems by both well-known and relatively obscure poets, including Louis Aragon (&quot;Il n&#x27;y a pas d&#x27;amour heureux&quot;), Victor Hugo (&quot;La Légende de la Nonne&quot;, &quot;Gastibelza&quot;), Paul Verlaine, Jean Richepin, François Villon (&quot;La Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis&quot;), and Antoine Pol (&quot;Les Passantes&quot;).

==Biography==
=== Childhood and education ===
Brassens was born in Sète, a commune in the Hérault department of the Occitanie region, to a French father and an Italian mother from the town of Marsico Nuovo (in the province of Potenza, Southern Italy).

Brassens grew up in the family home in Sète with his mother Elvira Dagrosa, father Jean-Louis, half-sister Simone (daughter of Elvira and her first husband, who was killed in World War I), and paternal grandfather Jules. His mother, whom Brassens labeled &quot;militantly for songs&quot; (&quot;militante de la chanson&quot;), had a love for music.

==Career==
He toured with Pierre Louki, who wrote a book of recollections entitled &quot;Avec Brassens&quot; (éditions Christian Pirot, 1999, ). After 1952, Brassens rarely left France. A few trips to Belgium and Switzerland; a month in Canada (1961, recording issued on CD in 2011) and another in North Africa were his only trips outside France – except for his concerts in Wales in 1970 and 1973 (Cardiff). His concert at Cardiff&#x27;s Sherman Theatre in 1973 saw Jake Thackray — a great admirer of his work – open for him.

==Songs==
Brassens accompanied himself on acoustic guitar. Most of the time the only other accompaniment came from his friend Pierre Nicolas with a double bass, and sometimes a second guitar (Barthélémy Rosso, ).

His songs often decry hypocrisy and self-righteousness in the conservative French society of the time, especially among the religious, the well-to-do, and those in law enforcement. The criticism is often indirect, focusing on the good deeds or innocence of others in contrast. His elegant use of florid language and dark humor, along with bouncy rhythms, often give a rather jocular feeling to even the grimmest lyrics.

Some of his most famous songs include:
* &#x27;La Guerre de &#x27;14–&#x27;18&#x27;, a song which satirises claims that World War One was an &quot;ideal war&quot; but condemns it as being &quot;the greatest human slaughterhouse in human history&quot;. Later adopted by English comedic duo Flanders and Swann as the basis for their own satire, &#x27;The War of 14–18&#x27;, which mocks traditional English martial glory.
* &quot;Les Copains d&#x27;Abord,&quot; about a boat of that name, and friendship, written for a movie &quot;Les copains&quot; (1964) directed by Yves Robert; (translated and covered by Asleep at the Wheel as &quot;&quot;Friendship First&quot; and by a Polish cover band as &quot;Kumple to grunt&quot;&quot; and included on their 2007 eponymously titled CD).
* &quot;Chanson Pour l&#x27;Auvergnat,&quot; lauding those who take care of the downtrodden against the pettiness of the bourgeois and the harshness of law enforcement.
* &quot;Brave Margot,&quot; about a young girl who gives a young kitten the breast, which attracts a large group of male onlookers.
* &quot;La Cane de Jeanne,&quot; for Marcel and Jeanne Planche, who befriended and sheltered him and others.
* &quot;La Mauvaise Réputation&quot; – &quot;the bad reputation&quot; – a semi-autobiographical tune with its catchy lyric: &quot;Mais les braves gens n&#x27;aiment pas que l&#x27;on suive une autre route qu&#x27;eux&quot; (But the good folks don&#x27;t like it if you take a different road than they do.) Pierre Pascal adapted part of the lyrics to Spanish under the title &quot;La mala reputación&quot;, which was later interpreted by Paco Ibañez.
* &quot;Les Amoureux des Bancs Publics&quot; – about young lovers who kiss each other publicly and shock self-righteous people.
* &quot;Pauvre Martin,&quot; the suffering of a poor peasant.
* &quot;Le Gorille&quot; – tells, in a humorous fashion, of a gorilla with a large penis (and admired for this by ladies) who escapes his cage. Mistaking a robed judge for a woman, the beast forcefully sodomizes him. The song contrasts the wooden attitude that the judge had exhibited when sentencing a man to death by the guillotine with his cries for mercy when being assaulted by the gorilla. This song, considered pornographic, was banned for a while. The song&#x27;s refrain (&quot;Gare au gori – i – i – i – ille&quot;, &quot;beware the gorilla&quot;) is widely known; it was translated into English by Jake Thackray as &quot;Brother Gorilla&quot;, by Greek singer-songwriter Christos Thivaios as Ο Γορίλλας (&quot;The Gorilla&quot;), by Spanish songwriter Joaquín Carbonell as &quot;El Gorila&quot; (&quot;The Gorilla&quot;), by Italian songwriter Fabrizio De André as &quot;Il Gorilla&quot; (&quot;The Gorilla&quot; – De André included this translation into his 1968 album &quot;Volume III&quot;), by the Polish cover band Zespół Reprezentacyjny as &quot;Goryl&quot; and by Israeli writer Dan Almagor as &quot;הגורילה&quot;.
* &quot;Fernande&quot; – a &#x27;virile antiphon&#x27; about the women lonely men think about to inspire self-gratification (or to nip it in the bud). Its infamous refrain (&quot;Quand je pense à Fernande, je bande, je bande...&quot;, &#x27;When I think about Fernande, I get hard&#x27;) is still immediately recognized in France, and has essentially ended the use of several female first names.
* &quot;Supplique pour être enterré à la plage de Sète&quot; , a long song (7:18) describing, in a colourful, &quot;live&quot; and poetic way, his wish to be buried on a particular sandy beach in his hometown, &quot;Plage de la Corniche&quot;.
* &quot;Mourir Pour des Idées,&quot; describing the recurring violence over ideas and an exhortation to be left in peace (translated into Italian by Italian singer-songwriter Fabrizio De André as &quot;Morire per delle idee&quot; and included in De André&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Canzoni&quot; and by the Polish cover band Zespół Reprezentacyjny as &quot;Śmierć za idee&quot; and included on their 2007 CD &quot;Kumple to grunt&quot;).

<text>The Little Shop of Horrors is a 1960 American horror comedy film directed by Roger Corman. Written by Charles B. Griffith, the film is a farce about a florist&#x27;s assistant who cultivates a plant that feeds on human blood. The film stars Jonathan Haze, Jackie Joseph, Mel Welles, and Dick Miller, who had all worked for Corman on previous films. Produced under the title &quot;The Passionate People Eater&quot;, the film employs an original style of humor, combining dark comedy with farce and incorporating Jewish humor and elements of spoof. &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; was shot on a budget of $28,000 (). Interiors were shot in two days, by utilizing sets that had been left standing from &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot;.

The film slowly gained a cult following through word of mouth when it was distributed as the B movie in a double feature with Mario Bava&#x27;s &quot;Black Sunday&quot; and later with &quot;Last Woman on Earth&quot;. The film&#x27;s popularity increased with local television broadcasts, and the presence of a young Jack Nicholson, whose small role in the film has been prominently promoted on its home video releases. The film was the basis for an Off-Broadway musical, &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, which in turn was adapted into a 1986 feature film. The musical enjoyed a 2003 Broadway debut and a 2019 off-Broadway revival, amongst other productions.

==Plot==

Florist shop owner Gravis Mushnick has two employees, Audrey Fulquard and Seymour Krelboined. Located on skid row, Mushnick&#x27;s rundown shop gets little business. When Seymour fouls up a floral arrangement for dentist Dr. Farb, Mushnick fires him. Hoping to change his mind, Seymour talks about a plant he has grown from seeds he got from a &quot;Japanese gardener over on Central Avenue.&quot; Seymour names the plant &quot;Audrey Jr.&quot;, which delights Audrey.

However, when finally shown the plant, Mushnick is unimpressed. Seymour suggests that Audrey Jr.&#x27;s uniqueness might attract people to see it, and Mushnick gives him one week to revive the plant. The usual plant food does not nourish it, but when Seymour accidentally pricks his finger, he discovers that the plant craves blood. Fed on Seymour&#x27;s blood, Audrey Jr. begins to grow. The shop&#x27;s revenues increase when customers are lured in to see the plant. Mushnick tells Seymour to refer to him as &quot;Dad&quot; and calls Seymour his son in front of a customer.

The plant develops the ability to speak and demands that Seymour feed it. Now anemic, Seymour walks along the railroad track. Throwing a rock to vent his frustration, he inadvertently knocks out a drunken man who falls on the track and is run over by a train. He tries to get rid of the body by burying it in a yard but is nearly caught each time. Guilt-ridden, Seymour decides to feed the mutilated body parts to Audrey Jr. Meanwhile, Mushnick returns to the shop to get cash and secretly observes Seymour feeding the plant. Mushnick considers telling the police but hesitates after seeing the line of customers at his shop the next day.

Seymour eventually arrives too, suffering from a toothache. Mushnick confronts him about Audrey Jr.&#x27;s eating habits without explicitly revealing what he knows about the plant. Seymour grows increasingly distressed as he realizes that Mushnick knows the truth. After finishing his rant, Mushnick sends Seymour to Farb, who wants to kill him and get even for his ruined flowers. Defending himself, Seymour kills Farb. Although horrified, Seymour feeds Farb&#x27;s body to Audrey Jr. The disappearances of the two men attract the attention of Sergeant Joe Fink and his assistant Officer Frank Stoolie.

Audrey Jr. grows several feet tall and is budding. A representative of the Society of Silent Flower Observers of Southern California announces that Seymour will receive a trophy and that she will return to the shop when the plant&#x27;s buds open. While Seymour and Audrey go on a date, Mushnick stays at the shop to see that Audrey Jr. harms no one else.

While tending to his shop, Mushnick finds himself at the mercy of a robber who pretended to be a customer earlier that day. The robber believes that the huge crowds he observed at the shop indicate the presence of a lot of money. Mushnick tricks the robber into thinking that the money is where Audrey Jr. is kept. The plant eats the robber after Mushnick maneuvers him next to it. When forced to damage his relationship with Audrey to keep her from discovering Audrey Jr.&#x27;s nature, Seymour confronts the plant, planning to no longer do its bidding. The plant then hypnotizes Seymour and commands him to bring it more food. He wanders the night streets and knocks out a prostitute, whom he takes to Audrey Jr.

Lacking clues about the disappearances, Fink and Stoolie attend a sunset celebration at the shop during which Seymour is to be presented with the trophy and Audrey Jr.&#x27;s buds are expected to open. As the attendees watch, four buds open; inside each flower is the face of one of Audrey Jr.&#x27;s victims. Fink and Stoolie realize that Seymour is the murderer. Seymour flees from the shop with the officers in pursuit. He manages to lose them and make his way back to the now-empty shop, where he blames Audrey Jr. for ruining his life. The plant instead asks to be fed. Seymour grabs a kitchen knife and climbs into Audrey Jr.&#x27;s maw with the intention of killing it. Later that evening, Audrey Jr. begins to wither and die. One last bud opens to reveal Seymour&#x27;s face.

==Development==
&quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; was developed when director Roger Corman was given temporary access to sets that had been left standing from his previous film, &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot;. Corman decided to use the sets in a film made in the last two days before the sets were torn down.

Corman initially planned to develop a story involving a private investigator. In the story&#x27;s initial version, the character that eventually became Audrey would have been referred to as &quot;Oriole Plove.&quot; Actress Nancy Kulp was a leading candidate for the part. The characters that eventually became Seymour and Winifred Krelborn were named &quot;Irish Eye&quot; and &quot;Iris Eye&quot;. Actor Mel Welles was scheduled to play a character named &quot;Draco Cardala,&quot; Jonathan Haze was scheduled to play &quot;Archie Aroma,&quot; and Jack Nicholson would have played a character named &quot;Jocko&quot;.

Charles B. Griffith wanted to write a horror-themed comedy film. According to Mel Welles, Corman was not impressed by the box office performance of &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot;, and had to be persuaded to direct another comedy. However, Corman later claimed he was interested because of &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot; and said the development process was similar to that of the earlier film, when he and Griffith were inspired by visiting various coffee houses:

We tried a similar approach for &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, dropping in and out of various downtown dives. We ended up at a place where Sally Kellerman (before she became a star) was working as a waitress, and as Chuck and I vied with each other, trying to top each other&#x27;s sardonic or subversive ideas, appealing to Sally as a referee, she sat down at the table with us, and the three of us worked out the rest of the story together.

The first screenplay Griffith wrote was &quot;Cardula&quot;, a Dracula-themed story involving a vampire music critic. After Corman rejected the idea, Griffith says he wrote a screenplay titled &quot;Gluttony&quot;, in which the protagonist was &quot;a salad chef in a restaurant who would wind up cooking customers and stuff like that, you know? We couldn&#x27;t do that though because of the code at the time. So I said, &#x27;How about a man-eating plant?&#x27;, and Roger said, &#x27;Okay.&#x27; By that time, we were both drunk.&quot;

Jackie Joseph later recalled &quot;at first they told me it was a detective movie; then, while I was flying back [to make the movie], I think they wrote a whole new movie, more in the horror genre. I think over a weekend they rewrote it.&quot;

The screenplay was written under the title &quot;The Passionate People Eater&quot;. Welles stated, &quot;The reason that &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; worked is because it was a love project. It was &quot;our&quot; love project.&quot; The film&#x27;s concept may have been inspired by &quot;Green Thoughts&quot;, a 1932 story by John Collier about a man-eating plant. Hollywood writer Dennis McDougal suggests that Griffith may have been influenced by Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s 1956 science fiction short story &quot;The Reluctant Orchid&quot; (which was in turn inspired by the 1894 H. G. Wells story &quot;The Flowering of the Strange Orchid&quot;).

Officers Fink and Stoolie were obvious take-offs of &quot;Dragnet&quot; characters Joe Friday and Frank Smith. The film opens up in a similar format to a Dragnet episode.

==Production==

The film was partially cast with stock actors that Corman had used in previous films. Writer Charles B. Griffith portrays several small roles. Griffith&#x27;s father appears as a dental patient, and his grandmother, Myrtle Vail, appears as Seymour&#x27;s hypochondriac mother. Dick Miller, who had starred as the protagonist of &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot; was offered the role of Seymour, but turned it down, instead taking the smaller role of Burson Fouch. Production at the &quot;Bucket of Blood&quot; sets was compressed into three days of cast rehearsals, immediately followed by two days and one night of principal photography.

It had been rumored that the film&#x27;s shooting schedule was based on a bet that Corman could not complete a film within that time. However, this claim has been denied by Mel Welles. According to Joseph, Corman shot the film quickly in order to beat changing industry rules that would have prevented producers from &quot;buying out&quot; an actor&#x27;s performance in perpetuity. On January 1, 1960, new rules were to go into effect requiring producers to pay all actors residuals for all future releases of their work. This meant that Corman&#x27;s B-movie business model would be permanently changed and he would not be able to produce low-budget films in the same way. Before these rules went into effect, Corman decided to shoot one last film and scheduled it for the last week in December 1959.

Interiors were shot with three cameras in wide, lingering master shots in single takes. Welles states that Corman &quot;had two camera crews on the set—that&#x27;s why the picture, from a cinematic standpoint, is really not very well done. The two camera crews were pointed in opposite directions so that we got both angles, and then other shots were &#x27;picked up&#x27; to use in between, to make it flow. It was a pretty fixed set and it was done sort of like a sitcom is done today, so it wasn&#x27;t very difficult.&quot;

At the time of shooting, Jack Nicholson had appeared in two films and worked with Roger Corman as the lead in &quot;The Cry Baby Killer&quot;. According to Nicholson, &quot;I went in to the shoot knowing I had to be very quirky because Roger originally hadn&#x27;t wanted me. In other words, I couldn&#x27;t play it straight. So I just did a lot of weird shit that I thought would make it funny.&quot; According to Dick Miller, all of the dialogue between his character and Mel Welles was ad-libbed. During a scene in which writer Charles B. Griffith played a robber, Griffith remembers that &quot;When [Welles] and I forgot my lines, I improvised a little, but then I was the writer. I was allowed to.&quot; However, Welles states that &quot;Absolutely none of it was ad-libbed [...] every word in &quot;Little Shop&quot; was written by Chuck Griffith, and I did ninety-eight pages of dialogue in two days.&quot;

According to Nicholson, &quot;we never did shoot the end of the scene. This movie was pre-lit. You&#x27;d go in, plug in the lights, roll the camera, and shoot. We did the take outside the office and went inside the office, plugged in, lit and rolled. Jonathan Haze was up on my chest pulling my teeth out. And in the take, he leaned back and hit the rented dental machinery with the back of his leg and it started to tip over. Roger didn&#x27;t even call cut. He leapt onto the set, grabbed the tilting machine, and said &#x27;Next set, that&#x27;s a wrap.&#x27;&quot; By 9 a.m. of the first day, Corman was informed by the production manager that he was behind schedule.

Exteriors were later directed by Griffith and Welles over two successive weekends, with $279 worth of rented equipment. Griffith and Welles paid a group of children five cents apiece to run out of a subway tunnel. They were also able to persuade winos to appear as extras for ten cents apiece. &quot;The winos would get together, two or three of them, and buy pints of wine for themselves! We also had a couple of the winos act as ramrods—sort of like production assistants—and put them in charge of the other wino extras.&quot; Griffith and Welles also persuaded a funeral home to donate a hearse and coffin—with a real corpse inside—for the film shoot. Griffith and Welles were able to use the nearby Southern Pacific Transportation Company yard for an entire evening using two bottles of scotch as persuasion. The scene in which a character portrayed by Robert Coogan is run over by a train was accomplished by persuading the railroad crew to back the locomotive away from the actor. The shot was later printed in reverse. Griffith and Welles spent a total of $1,100 on fifteen minutes&#x27; worth of exteriors.

The film&#x27;s musical score, written by cellist Fred Katz, was originally written for &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot;. According to Mark Thomas McGee, author of &quot;Roger Corman: The Best of the Cheap Acts&quot;, each time Katz was called upon to write music for Corman, Katz sold the same score as if it were new music. The score was used in a total of seven films, including &quot;The Wasp Woman&quot; and &quot;Creature from the Haunted Sea&quot;. Katz explained that his music for the film was created by a music editor piecing together selections from other soundtracks that he had produced for Corman.

Howard R. Cohen learned from Charles B. Griffith that when the film was being edited, &quot;there was a point where two scenes would not cut together. It was just a visual jolt, and it didn&#x27;t work. And they needed something to bridge that moment. They found in the editing room a nice shot of the moon, and they cut it in, and it worked. Twenty years go by. I&#x27;m at the studio one day. Chuck comes running up to me, says, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got to see this!&#x27; It was a magazine article—eight pages on the symbolism of the moon in &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;.&quot; According to Corman, the total budget for the production was $30,000. Other sources estimate the budget to be between $22,000 and $100,000.

==Release and reception==
===Release history===
Corman had initial trouble finding distribution for the film, as some distributors, including American International Pictures (AIP), felt that the film would be interpreted as anti-Semitic, citing the characters of Gravis Mushnick and Siddie Shiva. Welles, who was Jewish, stated that he gave his character a Turkish Jewish accent and mannerisms, and that he saw the humor of the film as playful, and felt there was no intent to defame any ethnic group. The film was finally released by its production company, The Filmgroup, nine months after it had been completed.

&quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; was screened out of competition at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival on the strength of its reviews in trade papers. Mel Welles had sent these to the festival, which asked for a print of the film.

A year later, AIP distributed the film as the B movie for their release of Mario Bava&#x27;s &quot;Black Sunday&quot;. Despite being barely mentioned in advertising (it was only occasionally referred to as an &quot;Added Attraction&quot; to Bava&#x27;s film), &quot;Black Sunday&quot;&#x27;s critical and commercial success resulted in positive word of mouth responses to &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot;. The film was re-released again the following year in a double feature with &quot;Last Woman on Earth&quot;.

Because Corman did not believe that &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; had much financial prospect after its initial theatrical run, he did not bother to copyright it, resulting in the film entering the public domain. Because of this, the film is widely available in copies of varying quality. The film was originally screened theatrically in the widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but has largely only been seen in open matte at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 since its original theatrical release.

===Critical and audience reception===
The film&#x27;s critical reception was largely favorable. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 92% based on reviews from 12 critics. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;The acting is pleasantly preposterous. [...] Horticulturalists and vegetarians will love it.&quot;

Jack Nicholson, recounting the reaction to a screening of the film, states that the audience &quot;laughed so hard I could barely hear the dialogue. I didn&#x27;t quite register it right. It was as if I had forgotten it was a comedy since the shoot. I got all embarrassed because I&#x27;d never really had such a positive response before.&quot;

In his book &quot;Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008&quot;, Bruce G. Hallenbeck called the film &quot;one of Corman&#x27;s gems, an idea that was born on &#x27;a night out on the town&#x27; that&#x27;s every bit as looney as it sounds.&quot; He cited the hilarious performances delivered by the ensemble cast and Corman&#x27;s strong results while working under the self-imposed pressures of a cheap budget and a fast shooting schedule.

===Legacy===
The film&#x27;s popularity slowly grew with local television broadcasts throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Interest in the film was rekindled when a stage musical adaptation called &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; was produced in 1982. It was based on the original film and was itself adapted to cinema as &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; in 1986, and with another feature film remake announced in 2020. A short-lived animated television series, &quot;Little Shop&quot;, inspired by the musical film, premiered in 1991. It ran for one season on Fox Kids in 1991. Seymour and Audrey were depicted as 13-year-olds, and the plant, &quot;Junior&quot;, was a rapping carnivorous prehistoric creature that sprouted from a fossilized seed. Each episode featured a few stylish music video sequences; Corman served as a creative consultant on the show.

The film was colorized twice, the first time being in 1987. This version was poorly received. The film was colorized again by Legend Films, who released its colorized version as well as a restored black-and-white version of the film on DVD in 2006. Legend Films&#x27; colorized version was well received, and was also given a theatrical premiere at the Coney Island Museum on May 27, 2006. The DVD included an audio commentary track by comedian Michael J. Nelson of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; fame. A DivX file of Legend&#x27;s colorized version with the commentary embedded is also available as part of Nelson&#x27;s RiffTrax On Demand service. On January 28, 2009, a newly recorded commentary by Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett was released by RiffTrax in MP3 and DivX formats. Legend&#x27;s colorized version is also available from Amazon Video on Demand, without Nelson&#x27;s commentary.

In November 2006, the film was issued by Buena Vista Home Entertainment in a double feature with &quot;The Cry Baby Killer&quot; (billed as a Jack Nicholson double feature) as part of the Roger Corman Classics series. However, the DVD contained only the 1987 colorized version of &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, and not the original black-and-white version.

It was announced on April 15, 2009, that Declan O&#x27;Brien would helm a studio remake of the film. &quot;It won&#x27;t be a musical&quot; he told Bloody Disgusting in reference to the Frank Oz film from 1986. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to reveal too much, but it&#x27;s me. It&#x27;ll be dark.&quot; When speaking with &quot;Shock &#x27;Till You Drop&quot;, he revealed &quot;I have a take on it you&#x27;re not going to expect. I&#x27;m taking it in a different direction, let&#x27;s put it that way.&quot; However, this version of the remake seems to have been shelved.

On December 7, 2016, Deadline reported that Greg Berlanti is set to direct a revamped film of the musical adaptation with Matthew Robinson writing the script.

In April 2017, a modern-day trading card set was released by Attic Card Company. The set includes autograph cards by both Jonathan Haze and Jackie Joseph.

The 2023 Christmas advert for British department store John Lewis &amp; Partners took inspiration from &quot;Little Shop Of Horrors&quot;, featuring a giant Venus flytrap called &quot;Snapper&quot;. &quot;Snapper&quot; also featured in John Lewis&#x27; Christmas merchandise including a plushy toy, Christmas tree baubles and pyjama sets.

In March 2024, Deadline announced that Joe Dante and Roger Corman were working on a reboot to be titled &quot;Little Shop of Halloween Horrors.&quot; Dante is set to direct with Charles S. Haas writing the script. Corman, who died in May that year, would have produced the film with Brad Krevoy. Warner Bros. revived The Geffen Company for the 2024 release of the &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; sequel &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot;.

<text>New Orleans Records was an American record label based in New Orleans, Louisiana and active from 1949 until the early 1980s. Originally founded by Orin Blackstone in 1949, it was revived by Clive Wilson in 1972. The label specialized in New Orleans jazz.

==History==
The New Orleans Records label was founded and originally run by the writer and jazz discographer Orin Blackstone (1907–1980). Blackstone though preferred the spelling of his first name to be &quot;Oren&quot;. It was based in the book and record shop which Blackstone owned with his brother Harvey at 439 Baronne Street in New Orleans. The shop was also known for its backroom jam sessions where musicians including Raymond Burke and George Girard would play. One of the earliest recordings on the New Orleans label was Johnny Wiggs performing &quot;Bourbon Street Bounce&quot; which had been written by Harvey Blackstone. According to Charles Suhor in &quot;Jazz in New Orleans: The Postwar Years&quot;, the recording became a surprise hit on local radio. Other New Orleans jazz musicians who recorded for the original New Orleans Records included Armand Hug, and Raymond Burke.

Financial troubles forced the closure of the Blackstone record shop in the early 1950s, and Orin Blackstone eventually moved to Slidell, Louisiana where he became the editor of the &quot;Slidell-St. Tammany Times&quot;. In 1972, the British jazz trumpeter Clive Wilson, who had settled in New Orleans in 1964, along with Paige Van Vorst, a jazz fan who lived in Chicago, revived the label. Their first release was &quot;Thomas Valentine at Kohlman&#x27;s Tavern&quot;. Under Wilson the label recorded performances by Herb Hall, Frog Joseph, Dave &quot;Fat Man&quot; Williams, and Jeanette Kimball. Among the label&#x27;s releases in the early 1980s was Kimball&#x27;s &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot;. Wilson and Van Vorst issued 10 LPs from 1972 – 1982, then sold the label to GHB/Jazzology Records in 1992. They published Dave Williams&#x27; original songs (French Market Music, BMI) which they retained, and pay royalties to the Williams family.

<text>The Ozark Folk Center is an Arkansas living history state park located in Mountain View, Arkansas, dedicated to preserving and presenting Ozark cultural heritage and tradition to the public.

== History ==
The University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service, in an early attempt to preserve the vanishing heritage of the Ozark Mountains, assisted local craftsmen and musicians to form the Ozark Foothills Crafts Guild in 1962. The guild started with 30 members and grew to a membership of over 300 master craftsmen and musicians.

In 1963 the guild, in cooperation with local civic organizations and education advocate Bessie Moore, organized the first Arkansas Folk Festival which attracted approximately 15,000 people. The festival became an annual event and within a few years was attracting almost 100,000 people to Mountain View. Because of the success of the annual festival the guild realized that they needed a permanent home.

The guild, in cooperation with local government, obtained a grant from the United States Economic Development Administration to establish a private commercial craft center at Mountain View. Prior to its opening in the Spring of 1973, the state of Arkansas recognized the potential of the project and folded the center into the state park system and provided additional funding.

The Ozark Folk Center produces the nationally distributed radio show &quot;Ozark Highlands Radio&quot;.

== Other area points of interest ==

Many visitors to the Ozark Folk Center also visit Blanchard Springs Caverns, float the Buffalo National River, or enjoy trout fishing on the White River, all of which are located in the Folk Center area.

The town of Mountain View bills itself as the &quot;Folk Music Capital of the World&quot; and local musicians often gather in small groups to play their instruments in the town square after dark during the summer months. Visitors have always been welcome to attend these impromptu free concerts and often bring their own lawn chairs. Food and drink are usually available from vendors on the square at these times.

<doc id="325214" wikidata="Q2003258" url="?curid=325214" title="Swan Records">
<text>Swan Records was a mid-20th century United States–based record label, founded in 1957 and based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It had a subsidiary label called Lawn Records.

==History==
Swan Records had enjoyed chart success with several U.S. artists but came into the spotlight after EMI, a prestigious British music company headquartered in London, leased the Beatles&#x27; recording of &quot;She Loves You&quot; backed with &quot;I&#x27;ll Get You&quot; and, as catalogue number Swan 4152, it became an American number 1 hit on March 21, 1964. This followed the decision made by EMI&#x27;s American subsidiary Capitol Records not to exercise its option to release the Beatles singles in the U.S.

Swan also assumed the rights to the German version of &quot;She Loves You&quot;, &quot;Sie Liebt Dich&quot; which peaked at No. 97 in 1964.

The success of the &quot;She Loves You&quot; single kept Swan going while other small record labels were snowed under by the British Invasion, but it finally closed filing bankruptcy in 1967.

The company was initially built on the strength of staff producer/writers Bob Crewe and Frank Slay.

Outside of &quot;She Loves You&quot;, Swan&#x27;s most remembered hit was &quot;Palisades Park&quot; in 1962, written by Chuck Barris, and performed by the most successful artist on the label, Freddy Cannon, who also scored hits with &quot;Tallahassee Lassie&quot; and &quot;Way Down Yonder in New Orleans&quot; before moving to Warner Brothers in 1964. Another hit for Swan was a release of The Rockin&#x27; Rebels&#x27; lone hit, the instrumental &quot;Wild Weekend&quot; which was reissued in 1962 after Buffalo WKBW radio disc jockey Tommy Shannon, partner in ShanTodd records, issued his night show theme of &quot;Wild Weekend&quot;. The group also released &quot;Rockin&#x27; Crickets&quot; as a follow up. Syracuse disc jockey Jimmy O&#x27;Brien used it as his theme on WNDR in Syracuse, New York, attracting the attention of Swan. The re-release on Swan became a national hit. Originally released on the Masters Releasing label Mar-Lee in 1960, Link Wray, best remembered for his classic 1958 instrumental &quot;Rumble&quot;, had a modest hit at Swan with &quot;Jack The Ripper&quot;.

Swan was co-owned by Bernie Binnick and Tony Mammarella, with Dick Clark reported to having a financial investment in it. When the payola scandals of the early 1960s broke, Clark divested himself of all of his outside interests to avoid conflict of interest. The label was distributed by fellow Philadelphian record company Cameo-Parkway Records, which at the time was the hottest label for teenage dance crazes (&quot;The Twist&quot;, &quot;Limbo Rock&quot;, &quot;(Do) The Bird&quot;, &quot;Wah-Watusi&quot;, &quot;Mashed Potato Time&quot;, &quot;Gravy (For My Mashed Potatoes)&quot;, &quot;Hully Gully Baby&quot;, &quot;Bristol Stomp&quot;, &quot;(Do the) New Continental&quot;).

One of the first hits for the Swan label was &quot;Click Clack&quot; by Dickie Doo and the Don&#x27;ts, a studio recording produced by Gerry Granahan under the pseudonym that was actually the nickname Dick Clark called his infant son, Dick Clark, Jr. It reached the top 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in February 1958. But another release by Billy &amp; Lillie had already done much better: &quot;La Dee Dah&quot; reached #9 in January 1958, becoming Swan Records&#x27; first top-10 hit.

In 1958, Mary Swan recorded &quot;My Heart Belongs to Only You&quot; #S4016B, and in 1959, she had a moderate hit with &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot;, Swan #4028.

The Three Degrees had a moderate hit with a cover version of the Five Keys&#x27; &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot;, but scored better on Roulette with their remake of the Chantel&#x27;s &quot;Maybe&quot; and &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot; on Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff&#x27;s Philadelphia International Records.

In 1973 Masters Releasing, Inc. (Corsican, Mar-Lee, Thunderbird, Sahara record labels) purchased from the bankruptcy Trustee all the sound recording rights of Swan including the master tapes. Masters Releasing was owned at the time by record executives Steve Brodie and Leonard &quot;Lenny&quot; Silver, who later formed Amherst Records. In addition, Freddy Cannon currently has complete control and ownership of his Swan recordings from Masters Releasing, as well as those released by Warner Bros. Records. In the 1980s Freddy Cannon released a single on Amherst Records.

The Swan label bears the message &quot;Don&#x27;t drop out&quot; on many releases to encourage kids to stay in school.

In 2007, Bruce Spizer released the book &quot;The Beatles Swan Song: &#x27;She Loves You&#x27; &amp; Other Records&quot;. It contains a detailed account of the records of The Beatles on the Swan label, as well as United Artists, Decca, Atco, MGM and Polydor, plus a section about the Capitol releases from the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s.

<text>This is a list of sovereign states by their &quot;de jure&quot; systems of government, as specified by the incumbent regime&#x27;s constitutional law. This list does not measure the degree of democracy, political corruption, or state capacity of governments.

==Parliamentary systems==
===Constitutional monarchies===
These are systems in which the head of state is a constitutional monarch; the existence of their office and their ability to exercise their authority is established and restrained by constitutional law.

Systems in which a prime minister is the active head of the executive branch of government. In some cases, the prime minister is also the leader of the legislature, while in other cases the executive branch is clearly separated from legislature (although the entire cabinet or individual ministers must step down in the case of a vote of no confidence). The head of state is a monarch who normally only exercises their powers with the consent of the government, the people and/or their representatives (except in emergencies, e.g. a constitutional crisis or a political deadlock).

*&quot;
*

*

===Parliamentary republics===
In a parliamentary republic, the head of government is selected or nominated by the legislature and is also accountable to it. The head of state is usually called a president and (in full parliamentary republics) is separate from the head of government, serving a largely apolitical, ceremonial role. In these systems, the head of government is usually called the prime minister, chancellor or premier. In mixed republican systems and directorial republican systems, the head of government also serves as head of state and is usually titled president.

In some full parliamentary systems, the head of state is directly elected by voters. Under other classification systems, however, these systems may instead be classed as semi-presidential systems as presidents are always attached to a political party and may have broad powers (despite their weak presidency). Full parliamentary republican systems with presidents being purely ceremonial and neutral with no broad powers usually do not have a directly elected head of state and instead often use either an electoral college or a vote in the legislature to appoint the president.

Non-UN members or observers are in italics.

====Parliamentary republics with an executive president====
A combined head of state and head of government in the form of an executive president is either elected by the legislature or by the voters from among candidates nominated by the legislature (in the case of Kiribati), and they must maintain the confidence of the legislature to remain in office. In effect, &quot;presidents&quot; in this system function the same as prime ministers do in other parliamentary systems.

*
*

===Presidential republics with a prime minister===
The following countries have presidential systems where the post of prime minister (official title may vary) exists alongside that of the president. The president is still both the head of state and government and the prime minister&#x27;s role is mostly to assist the president.
*
*
*
* (see Prime Cabinet Secretary)
*
* (see Chief minister)
*
*

Non-UN members or observers are in italics.

==Hybrid systems==
===Semi-presidential republics===
====President-parliamentary systems====
In a president-parliamentary system, the prime minister and cabinet are dually accountable to the president and the legislature.
*
*
*
*
*
*
*&quot;
*&quot;


Non-UN members or observers are in italics.

====Premier-presidential systems====
In a premier-presidential system, the prime minister and cabinet are exclusively accountable to the legislature.
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*


Non-UN members or observers are in italics.

===Assembly-independent republics===
A combined head of state and head of government (usually titled president) is elected by the legislature but is not held accountable to it (as is their cabinet), thus acting more independently from the legislature. They may or may not also hold a seat in the legislature.
*
====Directorial republic====
In a directorial republic, a council jointly exercises the powers and ceremonial roles of both the head of state and the head of government collectively. The council is elected by the parliament but is not subject to parliamentary confidence during its fixed term. The president is a member of the directorial council in a &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (first among equals) capacity and has no powers over other members of the directory.


==Theocratic republic==
* combines the forms of a presidential republic, with a president elected by universal suffrage, and a theocracy, with a Supreme Leader who is ultimately responsible for state policy, chosen for life by the elected Assembly of Experts. Candidates for both the Assembly of Experts and the presidency are vetted by the appointed Guardian Council. 

==Semi-constitutional monarchies==
The prime minister is the nation&#x27;s active executive, but the monarch still has considerable political powers that can be used at their own discretion.
*
*
*
*
*


==Absolute monarchies==
Specifically, monarchies in which the monarch&#x27;s exercise of power is unconstrained by any substantive constitutional law. The monarch acts as both head of state and head of government.
*
*


Non UN members or observers are in italics.

==One-party states==
States in which political power is &quot;by law&quot; concentrated within one political party whose operations are largely fused with the government hierarchy (in contrast to states where a multi-party system formally exists, but this fusion is achieved anyway through election fraud or underdeveloped multi-party traditions).
* 
* 
* 
* 
Non-UN members or observers are in italics.

==Military juntas==
A committee of the nation&#x27;s military leaders controls the government for the duration of a state of emergency. Constitutional provisions for government are suspended in these states; constitutional forms of government are stated in parentheses.
* 
* 
* 
* 
==Governments with no constitutional basis==
===Provisional governments===
States that have a system of government that is in transition or turmoil. These regimes lack a constitutional basis.
*
*
*
* Syria


Non-UN members or observers are in italics.

===Islamic theocracy===
* has a theocratic system wherein the Supreme Leader holds unlimited political power and the Quran is used in place of a constitution.
Non-UN members or observers are in italics.

==Systems of internal structure==
===Unitary states===
A state governed as a single power in which the central government is ultimately supreme and any administrative divisions (sub-national units) exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate. The majority of states in the world have a unitary system of government. Of the 193 UN member states, 126 are governed as centralized unitary states, and an additional 40 are regionalized unitary states.

====Centralized unitary states====
States in which most power is exercised by the central government. What local authorities do exist have few powers.

====Regionalized unitary states====

States in which the central government has delegated some of its powers to regional authorities, but where constitutional authority ultimately remains entirely at a national level.

===Federation===

States in which the national government shares power with regional governments with which it has legal or constitutional . The central government may or may not be (in theory) a creation of the regional governments.
* 
* 
*

==European Union==
The exact political character of the European Union is debated, some arguing that it is (unique), but others arguing that it has features of a federation or a confederation. It has elements of intergovernmentalism, with the European Council acting as its collective &quot;president&quot;, and also elements of supranationalism, with the European Commission acting as its executive and bureaucracy.

<text>Histoire de l&#x27;Inquisition en France is a book about witch trials in the early modern period published in 1829 by Étienne-Léon de Lamothe-Langon (1786–1864), supposedly on the basis of his unprecedented access to Church archives in Toulouse, granted by one Bishop . It is now regarded as a forgery. 

The dramatic and blood curdling accounts of &quot;Histoire&quot; were incorporated as a primary source into many other volumes, notably Joseph Hansen&#x27;s (1862–1943) German (&quot;Sources and investigations regarding the history of the witch craze and the witch hunts in the Middle Ages&quot;), which in turn became the source for many other works. Ultimately, Lamothe-Langon&#x27;s work became the sole or principal primary source for a substantial part of twentieth century popular and historical beliefs about the Inquisition, witchcraft, torture, and jurisprudence in the Middle Ages. 

In the early 1970s, the historians Norman Cohn and Richard Kieckhefer independently discovered that the &quot;Histoire&quot; was a fabrication; Lamothe-Langon&#x27;s archive did not exist, he did not have the paleographic skills to read books of that age, several major events he described could not have occurred, and his book was full of anachronisms.

Prior to fabricating the &quot;Histoire&quot;, Lamothe-Langon had been an author of gothic horror novels. Subsequently, he went on to forge several autobiographies of French historical figures.

<text>AA Limited, trading as The AA, is a British motoring association.

Founded in 1905, it provides vehicle insurance, driving lessons, breakdown cover, loans, motoring advice, road maps and other services. The association demutualised in 1999, to become a private limited company, and from 2014 a public limited company (PLC). In 2002 the AA Motoring Trust was created to continue its public interest and road safety activities.

In 2021, a consortium led by Tower Brook Capital Partners and Warburg Pincus completed the acquisition of AA Limited (formerly known as AA PLC).

==History==
===Charitable association===
The Automobile Association was founded in 1905 by William John Bosworth, to help motorists avoid police speed traps, in response to the Motor Car Act 1903 which introduced new penalties for breaking the speed limit, for reckless driving with fines, endorsements and the possibility of jail for speeding and other driving offences. The act also required drivers to hold a driving licence (which was obtained without a test on payment of five shillings at a post office) and to display a registration plate on their vehicle.

By 1906, the AA had erected thousands of roadside danger and warning signs, and managed road signage until responsibility was passed to local authorities in the early 1930s. By 1926, the organisation had installed 6,500 direction signs, and 15,000 village signs, most of which were removed during the Second World War. In 1908, the organisation published its first &quot;AA Members&#x27; Special Handbook&quot; containing a list of nationwide agents and repairers.
In 1910, in a legal test case (&quot;Betts vs. Stevens&quot;) involving an AA patrolman and a potentially speeding motorist, the Chief Justice, Lord Alverston, ruled that where a patrolman signals to a speeding driver to slow down and thereby avoid a speed trap, then they would have committed the offence of &#x27;obstructing an officer in the course of his duty&#x27; under the Prevention of Crimes Amendment Act 1885. The organisation then introduced a coded warning system, used until the 1960s, whereby an AA patrolman would salute the driver of a passing car which showed a visible AA Badge unless there was a speed trap nearby, on the understanding that their officers could not be prosecuted for failing to salute. The AA Handbook stated that &quot;It cannot be too strongly emphasised that when a patrol fails to salute, the member should stop and ask the reason why, as it is certain that the patrol has something of importance to communicate.&quot;

In 1910, the organisation introduced &quot;AA Routes&quot; and in 1912, began inspecting hotels and restaurants, issuing &quot;AA Star Classification&quot; to those deemed to be of sufficient quality and introduced pre-purchase and post-accident repair checks in the 1920s. In 1920 members were issued with keys to wooden roadside telephone boxes which could be used to call the organisation for assistance (the boxes had been erected from 1912 as shelters for watchmen or patrolmen). There were almost 1,000 boxes in their heyday, and they remained in use until the 1960s.

After the war, the AA led protests against petrol rationing, which was repealed in 1950. 1949 saw the launch of a night-time breakdown and recovery service, initially in London only, then extended nationwide. The &quot;AA Insurance&quot; brokerage service was started in 1967. The organisation campaigned for the compulsory wearing of seat belts, and for the introduction of unleaded petrol. Seat belt legislation became law in the United Kingdom on 1 January 1983 with the Transport Act 1981. The AA has lobbied successive governments over what they describe as &#x27;unfair motoring taxes&#x27;.

In February 1972, the AA relocated from its central London offices to Basingstoke. In the following year it began broadcasting &quot;AA Roadwatch&quot; traffic reports on commercial radio stations. &quot;AA Relay&quot; was also introduced in 1973, a service that will deliver a broken-down vehicle, its driver and passengers, luggage and trailer to anywhere in Britain.

====Member criticism====
In 1998, as a result of enquiries by James Birkin, an AA member it emerged that members had the right to stand for the executive committee. It also emerged during correspondence that there was no record of any member of the AA ever having stood for election. At that time, the committee had the right to veto those standing and had in fact always appointed new members. Birkin stood for the committee in 1998, having first issued a press release reported in the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; highly critical of way the system operated. He was duly rejected by the committee as a candidate they wished to be permitted to stand. Criticism followed at the annual general meeting in May 1998, describing the executive committee of behaving like a &quot;self-perpetuating oligarchy.&quot; The meeting repeatedly criticised chairman Sir Brian Shaw for having said that members who were unhappy with this arrangement could &quot;vote with their feet&quot;.

===For profit company===
The association demutualised in July 1999 to become a private limited company, which was bought later the same year by Centrica (owners of British Gas and Scottish Gas). Centrica sold the AA in July 2004 to two private equity firms, CVC and Permira, which in July 2007 merged the AA with Saga under Acromas Holdings.

In 2006, CVC and Permira were accused by Labour MP Gwyn Prosser in the House of Commons of &quot;greed&quot; and &quot;blatant asset stripping&quot; of the AA &quot;to borrow £500m on the basis of the AA&#x27;s assets in order to pay themselves a dividend.&quot; The AA responded that they were &quot;happy to have a reasoned conversation with Mr Prosser.&quot; 

In July 2013, the company launched &quot;AA Cars&quot;, linking buyers and sellers of used cars. The service is a partnership with Vcars, rebranding its partner&#x27;s existing online service and providing a check of the car&#x27;s history. At the time of rebranding, over 110,000 cars were available for purchase via 2,000 registered dealers.

The AA became listed on the London Stock Exchange as AA plc in June 2014, through an initial public offering in which Acromas sold all its shares. In September 2015, the AA acquired the garage-booking service Motoriety. In that year, the AA had around 3,000 patrol staff.

Bob Mackenzie was Executive Chairman from June 2014, having led the buy out from Acromas, until August 2017 when he was removed for &quot;gross misconduct&quot;. He was replaced by Simon Breakwell as Acting Chief Executive, and John Leach as Chairman.

In July 2015, the AA added more than 500 Volkswagen Transporter vans to their patrol fleet. More vans were ordered in February 2017.

The organisation had operated in Ireland from 1910. The AA Ireland business was sold to Carlyle Cardinal Ireland Fund and Carlyle Global Financial Services Partners in June 2016. The company stated that it had 3.3 million paying members in the first half of 2017.

The company accepted a takeover offer from a consortium of TowerBrook Capital Partners and Warburg Pincus in November 2020. The sale was completed in March 2021 with the company delisted from the London Stock Exchange.

=== Divisions and brands ===
The AA operates several different divisions and brands, including:

* The AA (breakdown cover, various insurance products, financial services products, motoring-related products)
* Beam, a specialist insurance brand for price comparison websites launched in 2022
* The British School Of Motoring (BSM), a driving school it acquired that was previously owned by rival RAC
* DriveTech, which provides driver training for companies and to individuals referred by the Police

=== Offices and physical estate ===
The AA has streamlined its property estate over time, with its new main headquarters opening at Plant, Basingstoke in December 2024. The business also maintains a call centre in Cheadle, Stockport and manages its patrol force of roadside mechanics from an operations centre in Oldbury near Birmingham. Additionally, a number of marketing, finance and digital functions operate from a London office, firstly at 90 Long Acre in Covent Garden, and from 2021 at the Blue Fin Building near the River Thames.

The AA Driving School, which includes the AA and BSM driving school brands, is based in offices in Cardiff.

The AA&#x27;s publishing arm, AA Publishing, is based in separate offices in Basingstoke.

===Continuing charities===
The AA Foundation for Road Safety Research was created by the AA in 1986. In 2002, the AA Motoring Trust charity was created to continue the AA&#x27;s public interest and road safety activities; its responsibilities were transferred to the IAM Motoring Trust, under the Institute of Advanced Motorists, at the end of 2006.

==AA ratings and awards==
===Hotels, guest accommodation, and self catering accommodation===
The AA awards ratings according to a system based on quality standards, agreed by the AA and the various tourist authorities in the United Kingdom. Properties are awarded a star rating, from one to five stars. In addition, each hotel receives a &quot;Merit % Score&quot; to enable comparison of hotels with similar star ratings. Hotels that are deemed to stand out may also receive a &quot;Red Star&quot; &quot;AA Inspectors&#x27; Choice&quot; award. A similar award for guest accommodation is the &quot;Gold Star&quot; for properties deemed to stand out.

===Campsites and caravan parks===
The AA award a &quot;Star rating&quot; to campsites and caravan parks on a five-point scale. A percentage score is also awarded to enable comparison of parks with the same rating.

===Restaurants===
AA inspectors award AA rosettes on a one to five system. About one in ten restaurants have been awarded one or more rosettes. As of 2024, around 1,500 restaurants in the United Kingdom hold AA rosettes.

<text>Perfect Records was a United States–based record label, founded in 1922 by Pathé Records to produce cheap 78 rpm discs.

From the start, Perfect Records sold well. The Pathé and Perfect labels were part of the merger that created the American Record Corporation (ARC) in July 1929. After the merger, ARC weeded out some of their poorer-selling labels (Pathé, for example), and Perfect continued to be a successful label through the 1930s until ARC dropped their entire group of cheaper labels in late 1938.

The label was revived in 1993 by Dean Blackwood and issued recordings pressed on 78 r.p.m. vinyl by Sun City Girls, Charlie Feathers, Junior Kimbrough, The Balfa Brothers, and John Fahey.

<text>James Anthony Abbott (born September 19, 1967) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball for the California Angels, New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox, and Milwaukee Brewers, from 1989 to 1999. He was successful at the major league level despite having been born without a right hand.

Abbott graduated from Flint Central High School and grew up in the East Village area of Flint, Michigan. He was drafted out of high school by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 36th round of the 1985 MLB draft but did not sign and decided to attend college. While with the University of Michigan, he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the nation&#x27;s best amateur athlete in 1987 and won a gold medal in the demonstration event at the 1988 Summer Olympics. He was drafted in the first round of the 1988 MLB draft and reached the major leagues the next year.

As a member of the New York Yankees, he threw a no-hitter against the Cleveland Indians in 1993. He retired with a career record of 87 wins and 108 losses, along with a 4.25 earned run average. He is a motivational speaker.

==Playing career==
===Amateur years===
Abbott was born in Flint, Michigan. He was picked up by the Ypsilanti, Michigan, American Legion team and went on to win the championship. He graduated from Flint Central High School in Michigan where he was a standout pitcher and quarterback. He played for the Grossi Baseball Club during the summer in Connie Mack Baseball. The Toronto Blue Jays selected Abbott in the 36th round in the 1985 Major League Baseball draft, but he did not sign with the Blue Jays.

Abbott enrolled at the University of Michigan and played college baseball for the Michigan Wolverines for three years from 1985 to 1988, leading them to two Big Ten Conference championships. In 1987, he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States, becoming the first baseball player to win the award. He was the flag-bearer for the United States at the 1987 Pan American Games in Indianapolis, helping lead the US to a second-place finish. Baseball was a demonstration sport in the 1988 Summer Olympics; he pitched the final game, winning an unofficial gold medal for the United States. Abbott was voted the Big Ten Athlete of the Year in 1988.

Abbott&#x27;s University of Michigan #31 jersey was retired at the Wolverines&#x27; April 18, 2009, home game against Michigan State University. In 2007, he was elected to the College Baseball Hall of Fame for his career at Michigan.

===MLB career===
The California Angels selected Abbott in the first round, with the eighth overall selection, of the 1988 Major League Baseball draft. In 1989, he joined the Angels&#x27; starting rotation as a rookie without playing a single minor league game. That season, he posted a 12–12 win–loss record with an earned run average (ERA) of 3.92, and finished fifth in the year&#x27;s American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award voting.

In 1991, Abbott went 18–11 for the Angels, who finished in last place in the AL West with an 81–81 record. He posted the fourth-lowest ERA in the AL (2.89) while pitching 243 innings. As a result, he finished third in the AL Cy Young Award voting. In the 1992 season, he posted a 2.77 ERA (fifth-lowest in the AL) but his win–loss record fell to 7–15 for the sixth-place Angels. He also won the Tony Conigliaro Award in 1992.

In the offseason, the Angels attempted to trim payroll and traded Abbott to the New York Yankees for their top minor league prospect first baseman J.T. Snow, and pitchers Russ Springer and Jerry Nielsen. He had an up and down year for the Yankees but on September 4, 1993, Abbott pitched a no-hitter against the Cleveland Indians. On November 26 in the same year, he appeared as himself on the TV series &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; in the episode &quot;Class Pre-Union&quot;.
In 1994, Abbott&#x27;s Yankees led the AL East, but the season was halted and the playoffs were canceled, due to a players strike on August 12. A free agent after the 1994 season, Abbott signed with the Chicago White Sox in April 1995. On July 27, 1995, the White Sox traded him and Tim Fortugno to the Angels for McKay Christensen, Andrew Lorraine, Bill Simas, and John Snyder. The Angels held an 11-game lead over the Seattle Mariners in August, but lost the AL West division title in a one-game playoff to the Mariners.

Abbott re-signed with the Angels for the 1996 season. He struggled through it, posting a 2–18 record with a 7.48 ERA. The Angels released him before Opening Day of the 1997 season, and he retired.

Abbott returned to the White Sox in 1998, starting five games and winning all five. He continued his comeback the following year with the Milwaukee Brewers, but pitched ineffectively. This was the first time he had played for a National League team, forcing him to bat for the first time in his career. He recorded two hits in 21 at bats during his Brewers stint. Both of his hits scored runs, and both hits came off Chicago Cubs pitcher Jon Lieber, albeit in different games.

Abbott retired after the 1999 season with a career record of 87–108, with a 4.25 ERA. He became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame on the 2005 BBWAA ballot, but received only 13 votes (2.5% of the total vote) and fell off the ballot.

==Playing with one hand==
When preparing to pitch the ball, Abbott would rest his glove on the end of his right forearm. After releasing the ball, he would quickly slip his hand into the glove, usually in time to field any balls that a two-handed pitcher would be able to field. Then he would secure the glove between his right forearm and torso, slip his hand out of it, and remove the ball from it, usually in time to throw out the runner at first or sometimes even start a double play. At all levels, teams tried to exploit his fielding disadvantage by repeatedly bunting to him.

Batting was not an issue for Abbott for the majority of his career, since the American League used the designated hitter, and he played only two seasons in the interleague play era. But he tripled in a spring training game in 1991 off Rick Reuschel, and when he joined the National League&#x27;s Milwaukee Brewers in 1999, he had two hits in 21 at-bats, both off Jon Lieber. New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera claimed to have witnessed Abbott hitting home runs during batting practice.

His disability inspired him to work harder than most. &quot;As a kid I really wanted to fit in,&quot; Abbott says on his website about growing up with a disability. &quot;Sports became a way for me to gain acceptance. I think this fueled my desire to succeed. I truly believe that difficult times and disappointments can push us to find abilities and strengths we wouldn&#x27;t know existed without the experience of struggle.&quot;

== Awards ==
*1986 – Abbott was presented with the United States Sports Academy&#x27;s Mildred &quot;Babe&quot; Didrikson Zaharias Courage Award for his courageous action in overcoming adversity to excel in sports.
*1987 – Abbott won the Golden Spikes Award.
*1992 – Abbott was awarded the Tony Conigliaro Award, given annually by the Boston Red Sox to a Major League player who overcomes an obstacle and adversity through the attributes of spirit, determination, and courage that were trademarks of the Boston star.
*2003 – Abbott was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals.
*2014 – Abbott was one of 12 recipients of the Henry Viscardi Achievement Awards.

== Autobiography ==
 In April 2012, Abbott&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Imperfect: An Improbable Life&quot; (), co-written with Tim Brown, was published by Ballantine Books.

<text>Hugh Malcolm Downs (February 14, 1921July 1, 2020) was an American radio and television broadcaster, announcer and programmer; television host; news anchor; TV producer; author; game show host; talk show sidekick; and music composer. A regular television presence from the mid 1940s until the late 1990s, he had several successful roles on morning, prime-time, and late-night television. For several years, he held the certified Guinness World Record for the most hours on commercial network television before being surpassed by Regis Philbin, who died 24 days after he did.

Downs served as announcer and sidekick for &quot;Tonight Starring Jack Paar&quot; from 1957 to 1962, co-host of the NBC News program &quot;Today&quot; from 1962 to 1971, host of the &quot;Concentration&quot; game show from 1958 to 1969, and anchor of the ABC News magazine &quot;20/20&quot; from 1978 to 1999.

Downs started his career in radio in 1939 and began in live television in 1945 in Chicago, where he became a regular on several nationally broadcast programs over the next decade. He moved to New York City in 1954, when he was invited to do a program there. Among other shows during his career, he hosted the PBS talk show &quot;Over Easy&quot; and was the occasional co-host of the syndicated talk show &quot;Not for Women Only&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Downs was born on February 14, 1921, in Akron, Ohio, to Edith (née Hicks) and Milton Howard Downs, who worked in business. He was educated at Lima Shawnee High School in Lima, Ohio; Bluffton College, a Mennonite school in Bluffton, Ohio; and Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, during the period 1938–41.

==Radio announcer and programmer==
Downs worked as a radio announcer and program director in 1939 at WLOK in Lima, Ohio, after his first year of college. In 1940, he moved on to WWJ in Detroit. Downs served in the United States Army during World War II in 1943 and then joined the NBC radio network at WMAQ as an announcer in Chicago, where he lived until 1954. He can be heard announcing the ground breaking 1948–1950 radio show &quot;Destination Freedom&quot; (written by Richard Durham) which told stories of historical and current Black people. While at WMAQ, Downs also acted, including as the &quot;co-pilot&quot;, along with famed Chicago children&#x27;s program personality Ned Locke, on the &quot;Uncle Ned&#x27;s Squadron&quot; program in 1951. Programs of &quot;Uncle Ned&#x27;s Squadron&quot; can be found in the archives of Museum Of Broadcast Communications in Chicago, and, at no charge, from radio historian Chuck Schaden&#x27;s &quot;Speaking Of Radio – Those Were The Days Encore&quot; website. Downs then attended Columbia University in New York City from 1955 to 1956.

==Television career==

Downs made his first television news broadcast in September 1945 from the still-experimental studio of WBKB-TV (now WBBM-TV) in Chicago, a station then owned by the Balaban and Katz theater subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. Downs later recalled that when he went for his first job, he had never seen a television before, and he was unsure whether television would last. Downs became a television regular in 1950, announcing for &quot;Hawkins Falls&quot;, the first successful television soap opera, which was sponsored by Lever Brothers&#x27; &quot;Surf&quot; detergent. He also announced the Burr Tillstrom children&#x27;s show &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; from the NBC studios at Chicago&#x27;s Merchandise Mart after the network picked up the program from WBKB.

In March 1954, Downs moved to New York City to accept a position as announcer for Pat Weaver&#x27;s &quot;The Home Show&quot; starring Arlene Francis. That program lasted until August 1957. He was the announcer for Sid Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot; for the 1956–57 season and one of NBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; &quot;Communicators&quot; from 1955 to 1959. Downs became a bona fide television &quot;personality&quot; as Jack Paar&#x27;s announcer on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; from mid 1957, when he replaced Franklin Pangborn, until Paar&#x27;s departure in March 1962, and then continued to announce for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; until the summer of 1962, when Ed Herlihy took the announcing reins. Herlihy held that post until October 1, 1962, when Johnny Carson took over the show, and brought Ed McMahon on as his announcer.

On August 25, 1958, Downs began a more-than-ten-year run concurrently hosting the original version of the game show &quot;Concentration&quot;. He also hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; for nine years from September 1962 to October 1971 and co-hosted the syndicated television program &quot;Not for Women Only&quot; with Barbara Walters in 1975–76. Downs also appeared as a panelist on the television game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; and played himself in an episode of NBC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot;

Downs earned a postgraduate degree in gerontology from Hunter College while he was hosting &quot;Over Easy&quot;, a PBS television program about aging that aired from 1977 to 1983. He was probably best known in later years as the Emmy Award-winning co-anchor—again paired with Walters—of the ABC news TV show &quot;20/20&quot;, a prime-time news magazine program, from the show&#x27;s second episode in 1978 until his retirement in 1999.

Downs was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum in 1984. In that same year, he was certified by the Guinness Book of World Records (now &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;) as holding the record for the greatest number of hours on network commercial television (15,188 hours), though he lost the record for most hours on all forms of television to Regis Philbin in 2004.

A published composer, Downs hosted the PBS showcase for classical music &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot; from 1990 to 1996. Downs made a cameo appearance on &quot;Family Guy&quot; in addition to other television shows.

Downs was seen in infomercials for Bottom Line Publications, including its &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Treasury of Health Secrets&quot;, as well as one for a personal coach. He appeared in an infomercial for &quot;Where There&#x27;s a Will There&#x27;s an A&quot; in 2003. His subsequent infomercial work aroused some controversy, with many arguing that the products were scams.

Downs appeared in regional public-service announcements in Arizona for the state&#x27;s Motor Vehicles Division and for Hospice of the Valley, a Phoenix-area non-profit organization specializing in hospice care. He also produced some public short-form programs in which he served as host of educational interstitials.

On October 13, 2007, Downs became one of the first inductees into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Downs was inducted as a Lincoln Laureate in the Lincoln Academy of Illinois and was awarded the Order of Lincoln (the state&#x27;s highest honor) by the governor of Illinois in 1967.

==Public service and political views==

Downs was a special consultant to the United Nations for refugee problems from 1961 to 1964, and served as chairman of the board of the United States Committee for UNICEF.

Downs wrote a column for &quot;Science Digest&quot; during the 1960s. He was a science consultant for Westinghouse Laboratories and the Ford Foundation and an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences. He served as chair of the Board of Governors of the National Space Society until 2019 and was a longtime president and chairman of the society&#x27;s predecessor, the National Space Institute. The asteroid 71000 Hughdowns is named after him.

The auditorium of Shawnee High School in Lima, Ohio, and the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, are named in his honor.

As part of Arizona&#x27;s centennial celebration in February 2012, Downs narrated Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln Portrait&quot; on stage with the Phoenix Symphony.

Downs publicly expressed support for libertarian viewpoints. He opposed the U.S. war on drugs and appeared in several pieces about the war on drugs and hemp. On his last &quot;20/20&quot;, he was asked if he had any personal opinions that he would like to express, and he responded that marijuana should be legalized.

==Personal life==
Downs married Ruth Shaheen on February 17, 1944. They had two children, Deirdre and H.R. Ruth died on March 28, 2017, at age 95.

Downs held a private pilot certificate, and was rated for multi-engine airplanes, single-engine seaplanes, hot air balloons, and glider aerotow.

==Death==
On July 1, 2020, at the age of 99, Downs died from heart failure at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona. He was interred at the Christ Church of the Ascension Memory Garden in Paradise Valley, Arizona.

<doc id="325232" wikidata="Q983063" url="?curid=325232" title="Greenwashing">
<text>Greenwashing (a compound word modeled on &quot;whitewash&quot;), also called green sheen, is a form of advertising or marketing spin that deceptively uses green PR and green marketing to persuade the public that an organization&#x27;s products, goals, or policies are environmentally friendly. Companies that intentionally adopt greenwashing communication strategies often do so to distance themselves from their environmental lapses or those of their suppliers. Firms engage in greenwashing for two primary reasons: to appear legitimate and to project an image of environmental responsibility to the public. Because there &quot;is no harmonised definition of greenwashing&quot;, a determination that this is occurring in a given instance may be subjective.

Greenwashing occurs when an organization spends significantly more resources on &quot;green&quot; advertising than on environmentally sound practices. Many corporations use greenwashing to improve public opinion of their brands. Complex corporate structures can further obscure the bigger picture. Corporations attempt to capitalize off of consumer&#x27;s environmental guilt. Critics of the practice suggest that the rise of greenwashing, paired with ineffective regulation, contributes to consumer skepticism of all green claims and diminishes the power of the consumer to drive companies toward greener manufacturing processes and business operations. Greenwashing covers up unsustainable corporate agendas and policies. Highly public accusations of greenwashing have contributed to the term&#x27;s increasing use.

Greenwashing has recently increased to meet consumer demand for environmentally-friendly goods and services. New regulations, laws, and guidelines put forward by organizations such as the Committee of Advertising Practice in the UK aim to discourage companies from using greenwashing to deceive consumers. At the same time, activists have been increasingly inclined to accuse companies of greenwashing, with inconsistent standards as to what activities merit such an accusation.

==Characteristics==

Activities deemed to be characteristic of greenwashing can vary by time and place, product, and the opinions or expectations of the person making the determination.

According to the United Nations, greenwashing can present itself in many ways:
# Claiming that the company will achieve future environment milestones while not putting sufficient plans in place to do so.
# Being intentionally vague about operations or using vague claims that cannot be specifically proven (like saying they are &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; or &quot;green&quot;).
# Saying that a product does not contain harmful materials or use harmful practices that they would not use anyway.
# Highlighting one thing the company does well regarding the environment while not doing anything else.
# Promoting products that meet regulatory minimums as if peer products do not.

TerraChoice, an environmental consulting division of UL, described &quot;seven sins of greenwashing&quot; in 2007 to &quot;help consumers identify products that made misleading environmental claims&quot;:

# &quot;Hidden Trade-off&quot;: a claim that a product is &quot;green&quot; based on an unreasonably narrow set of attributes without attention to other critical environmental issues.
# &quot;No Proof&quot;: a claim that cannot be substantiated by easily accessible information or a reliable third-party certification.
# &quot;Vagueness&quot; is a poorly defined or broad claim that the consumer will likely misunderstand its meaning. &quot;All-natural,&quot; for example, is not necessarily &quot;green.&quot;
# &quot;Worshipping False Labels&quot;: a claim that, through words or images, gives the impression of a third-party endorsement where none exists.
# &quot;Irrelevance&quot;: a claim that may be truthful but unimportant or unhelpful to consumers seeking environmentally preferable products.
# &quot;Lesser of Two Evils&quot;: a claim that may be true within the product category, but risks distracting consumers from the more significant environmental impact of the category.
# &quot;Fibbing&quot;: a claim that is simply false.

The organization noted that by 2010, approximately 95% of consumer products in the U.S. claiming to be green were discovered to commit at least one of these sins.

==History==

The origins of greenwashing can be traced to several different moments. For example, Keep America Beautiful was a campaign founded by beverage manufacturers and others in 1953. The campaign focused on recycling and littering, diverting attention away from corporate responsibility to protect the environment. The objective was to forestall the regulation of disposable containers such as the one established by Vermont.

In the mid-1960s, the environmental movement gained momentum, particularly after the publication of the landmark Silent Spring by Rachel Carson. The book marked a turning point about the environment and inspired citizen action. It prompted many companies to seek a new cleaner or greener image through advertising. Jerry Mander, a former Madison Avenue advertising executive, called this new form of advertising &quot;ecopornography.&quot;

The first Earth Day was held on 22 April 1970. Most companies did not actively participate in the initial Earth Day events because environmental issues were not a major corporate priority, and there was a sense of skepticism or resistance to the movement&#x27;s message. Nevertheless, some industries began to advertise themselves as friendly to the environment. For example, public utilities were estimated to have spent around $300 million advertising themselves as clean and green companies, which was eight times what they spent on pollution reduction research.

The term &quot;greenwashing&quot; was coined by New York environmentalist Jay Westerveld in a 1986 essay about the hotel industry&#x27;s practice of placing notices in bedrooms promoting the reuse of towels to &quot;save the environment&quot;. He noted that these institutions often made little or no effort toward reducing energy waste, although towel reuse saved them laundry costs. He concluded that the fundamental objective was most frequently increased profit. He labeled this and other profitable-but-ineffective &quot;environmentally-conscientious&quot; acts as &quot;greenwashing&quot;.

In 1991, a study published in the &quot;Journal of Public Policy and Marketing&quot; (American Marketing Association) found that 58% of environmental ads had at least one deceptive claim. Another study found that 77% of people said a company&#x27;s environmental reputation affected whether they would buy its products. One-fourth of all household products marketed around Earth Day advertised themselves as being green and environmentally friendly. In 1998, the Federal Trade Commission created the &quot;Green Guidelines&quot;, which defined terms used in environmental marketing. The following year, the FTC found the Nuclear Energy Institute&#x27;s environmentally clean claims invalid. The FTC did nothing about the ads because they were out of the agency&#x27;s jurisdiction. This caused the FTC to realize they needed new, clear, enforceable standards. In 1999, the word &quot;greenwashing&quot; was added to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

Days before the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Greenpeace released the Greenpeace Book on Greenwash, which described the corporate takeover of the UN conference and provided case studies of the contrast between corporate polluters and their rhetoric. Third World Network published an expanded version of that report, &quot;Greenwash: The Reality Behind Corporate Environmentalism.&quot;

In 2002, during the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, the Greenwashing Academy hosted the Greenwash Academy Awards. The ceremony awarded companies like BP, ExxonMobil, and even the U.S. Government for their elaborate greenwashing ads and support for greenwashing. A European Union study from 2020 found that over 50% of examined environmental claims in the EU were vague, misleading or unfounded and 40% were unsubstantiated.

Many companies have committed to lessen their greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero due to the Paris Agreement being established in 2015. A net zero emissions level means that any emissions given off by a company would be offset by carbon eliminators in the natural world (otherwise known as carbon sinks). However, companies are not actually cutting emissions, but are creating infeasible plans and trying to improve other things rather than their emissions. Therefore, most companies are not actually upholding their agreements and ultimately continue not to cause any positive change.

==Examples==

=== Fashion industry ===
* Kimberly Clark&#x27;s claim of &quot;Pure and Natural&quot; diapers in green packaging. The product uses organic cotton on the outside but uses the same petrochemical gel inside as before. Pampers also claims that &quot;Dry Max&quot; diapers reduce landfills by decreasing the amount of paper fluff in the diaper, but also a way to trim product and to save money in producing Pampers.
* In January 2020, the Fur Free Alliance noted that the &quot;WelFur&quot; label, which advocated for animal welfare on fur farms, is run by the fur industry and is aimed at European fur farms.
* Clothing company H&amp;M came under fire for greenwashing their manufacturing practices as a result of a report published by &quot;Quartz News&quot;.

=== Food industry ===
* In 2009, McDonald&#x27;s changed the color of its European logos from yellow-and-red to yellow-and-green; a spokesman explained that the change was &quot;to clarify [their] responsibility for the preservation of natural resources.&quot; In October 2021 McDonald&#x27;s was accused of greenwashing after announcing its pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
* In 2018, in response to increased calls to ban plastic straws, Starbucks introduced a lid with a built-in drinking straw that contained more plastic by weight than the old straw and lid together (though it can be recycled, unlike its predecessor).
* In 2020, Coca-Cola was found to be the world&#x27;s number one plastic polluter by Break Free From Plastic. However, the company continues to say that it is making headway in lessening plastic waste. They say they have a commitment to &quot;get every bottle back by 2030&quot; despite being the biggest plastic polluter for several years in a row. They were sued by the Earth Island Institute in 2021 for their false claims.

=== Automobile industry ===
* The UK Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints against major vehicle manufacturers, including Suzuki, SEAT, Toyota, and Lexus who made false claims about their vehicles.
* Volkswagen fitted their cars with a &quot;defeat device&quot; that activated only when a car&#x27;s emissions were being tested to reduce polluting emissions. In normal use, by contrast, the cars were emitting 40 times the allowed rate of nitrogen oxide. Forbes estimates that this scandal cost Volkswagen US$35.4 billion. Other automakers also cheated on emissions systems.
* In November 2020, Aston Martin, Bosch, and other brands were discovered to have funded a report which downplayed electric vehicles&#x27; environmental benefits with misleading information about the emissions produced during the manufacture of electric cars, in response to the UK announcing that it would ban the sale of vehicles with internal combustion engines from 2030. The greenwashing scandal became known as Astongate given the relationship between the British automotive manufacturer and Clarendon Communications, a shell company posing as a public relations agency which was set up to promote the report, and which was registered to James Michael Stephens – the Director of Global Government &amp; Corporate Affairs at Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd.
* Calling the next provisionally approved European emission standards for light and medium vehicles &quot;Euro 7&quot; instead of &quot;Euro 6f&quot; could be considered greenwashing because of unchanged pollutant limits.
* Calling start-stop systems &quot;micro&quot; hybrid.
* &quot;Mild&quot; or &quot;smart&quot; hybrids.
* Calling hybrid vehicles &quot;self charging&quot; or &quot;fueled by petrol, driven by electric&quot;.
* The fleet of PHEVs underperforms on emissions reductions. Although they would have more potential if properly used.
* Fuel cell vehicles powered by non-green hydrogen.

=== Coal Industry ===
* In 2024 Turkey&#x27;s Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Alparslan Bayraktar said that the government aimed to increase coal mining in an environmentally friendly way.

=== Oil industry ===
* A 2010 advertising campaign by Chevron was described by the Rainforest Action Network, Amazon Watch, and The Yes Men as greenwash. A spoof campaign was launched to pre-empt Chevron&#x27;s greenwashing.
* In 1985, the Chevron Corporation launched one of the most famous greenwashing ad campaigns. Chevron&#x27;s &quot;People Do&quot; advertisements were aimed at a &quot;hostile audience&quot; of &quot;societally conscious&quot; people. Two years after the campaign&#x27;s launch, surveys found people in California trusted Chevron more than other oil companies to protect the environment. In the late 1980s, The American Chemistry Council started a program called Responsible Care, which shone a light on the environmental performances and precautions of the group&#x27;s members. The loose guidelines of responsible care caused industries to adopt self-regulation over government regulation.
* BP was also reported to have engaged in such conduct in the 2010s.

=== Political campaigns ===

* In 2010, environmentalists stated the Bush Administration&#x27;s &quot;Clear Skies Initiative&quot; actually weakened air pollution laws. Similar laws were issued under President Macron of France as &quot;simplifying ecology rules&quot; that were criticized on similar grounds while still being referred to by his government as &quot;ecology laws&quot;.
* &quot;Clean Coal,&quot; an initiative adopted by several platforms for the 2008 U.S. presidential election, cited carbon capture and storage as a means of reducing carbon emissions by capturing and injecting carbon dioxide produced by coal power plants into layers of porous rock below the ground. According to Fred Pearce&#x27;s Greenwash column in The Guardian, clean coal is the &quot;ultimate climate change oxymoron... pure and utter greenwash&quot;. In 2017, Australia&#x27;s then Treasurer Scott Morrison used &quot;Clean Coal&quot; as the basis to suggest clean energy subsidies be used to build new coal power plants.
* The renaming of &quot;Tar Sands&quot; to &quot;Oil Sands&quot; (Alberta, Canada) in corporate and political language reflects an ongoing debate between the project&#x27;s adherents and opponents. This semantic shift can be seen as a case of greenwashing in an attempt to counter growing public concern about the environmental and health impacts of the industry. While advocates claim that the shift is scientifically derived to better reflect the use of the sands as a precursor to oil, environmental groups argue that it is simply a means of cloaking the issue behind friendlier terminology.
* Since 2018, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been increasingly promoting himself as an environmental champion and used rhetoric about protecting the environment at international events. Modi was instrumental in forming the International Solar Alliance and, in 2024, promoted the native foxnut as an alternative food. However, within the country, Modi&#x27;s Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party has repeatedly expressed opposition to environmentalism, whenever the former has clashed with Hindu religious occasions, most notably over the bursting of firecrackers in Diwali. The National Green Tribunal, the premier environmental protection body of the country has been labelled as an &#x27;Hinduphobic&#x27; organisation by many BJP leaders. Hindutva hardliner Yogi Adityanath slammed the National Green Tribunal&#x27;s report on the pollution of the Hindu holy river Ganga during the 2025 Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj as fake and an attempt to mock the faith of Hindus. Modi&#x27;s green push is described as an attempt to greenwash the images of him and his party before the international community.
* In 2021, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced a tree planting campaign in the desert as part of the plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2060. The plan was criticized as a greenwashing attempt by some climate scientists.
* Some environmental activists and critics condemned the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) as greenwashing. They also condemned COP28, which is purported to have the highest carbon footprint of all COP events. In May 2023, a Wikipedia user who identified themselves as an employee of ADNOC was alleged to have suggested edits to the Wikipedia article of Sultan Al Jaber, president of COP28, which presented Al Jaber as a supporter of the climate movement. In June 2023, Marc Owen Jones of Hamad Bin Khalifa University noted that a large number of apparently fake Twitter profiles were used to defend Al Jaber&#x27;s COP28 presidency.
* The construction of the new Indonesian capital Nusantara, despite being described as a smart, green, and clean city, has been accused by many groups of alleged greenwashing by the Indonesian government due to environmental damages caused by its construction.

=== Business slogans ===
* &quot;Clean Burning Natural Gas&quot; When compared to the dirtiest fossil fuel, coal, natural gas is only 50% as dirty. Producing natural gas through fracking and distribution by a pipeline may lead to methane emissions into the atmosphere. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse agent. Despite this, natural gas is often presented as a cleaner fossil fuel in environmental discourse. In practice, it balances the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy. It can be considered a useful &quot;transitional technology&quot; towards hydrogen as hydrogen can already be blended in and eventually be used to replace it, inside gas networks initially conceived for natural gas-use.
* First-generation biofuels are said to be better for the environment than fossil fuels, but some, such as palm oil, contribute to deforestation (which contributes to global warming due to release of ). Higher-generation biofuels do not have these particular issues, but have contributed significantly to deforestation and habitat destruction in Canada due to rising corn prices, which make it economically worthwhile to clear-cut existing forests in agricultural areas.
* An article in Wired magazine highlighted slogans that suggest environmentally benign business activity: the Comcast Ecobill has the motto &quot;PaperLESSisMORE,&quot; but Comcast uses large amounts of paper for direct marketing.
* The Poland Spring (from the American city of Poland, Maine) eco shape bottle is touted as &quot;A little natural does a lot of good,&quot; although 80% of beverage containers go to landfills.
* The Airbus A380 airliner is described as &quot;A better environment inside and out&quot; even though air travel has a high environmental cost.
* The multinational oil company formerly known as British Petroleum launched a rebranding campaign in 2000, revising the company&#x27;s acronym as &quot;Beyond Petroleum.&quot; The campaign included a revised green logo, advertisements, a solar-paneled gas station in Los Angeles, and clean energy rhetoric across media to strategically position itself as the &#x27;greenest&#x27; global oil company. The campaign became the center of public controversy due to the company&#x27;s hypocrisy around lobbying efforts that sought permission to drill in protected areas and its negligent operating practices that led to severe oil spillsmost notably the Prudhoe Bay pipeline rupture in 2006 and the Gulf of Mexico rig explosion in 2010.

=== ESG ratings ===
* In 2021, American financial services company MSCI upgraded the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating of the company McDonald&#x27;s, which produces emissions comparable to an entire mid-size EU country like Portugal, by eliminating from its analysis the significance of greenhouse gas emissions and highlighting a new recycling initiative, which had been mandated by regulatory authorities in France and the United Kingdom for all fast-food companies.
* Volkswagen had an ESG rating higher than its peer average, even though in September 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sanctioned Volkswagen with over $25 billion in fines for using a &quot;defeat device&quot;, causing vehicles produced from 2009 to 2015 to pollute at a much higher rate than advertised.
* Totalenergies was sued for claiming it can reach net zero objectives by 2050 while increasing fossil fuel activities. It is rated A- on climate by the CDP.

== Consequences ==

=== Lack of integrity ===
Some companies communicate and publicize unsubstantiated ethical claims or social responsibility, and practice greenwashing, which increases consumer cynicism and mistrust. By using greenwashing, companies can present their business as more ecologically sustainable than it is. According to a policy report, greenwashing includes risks such as misleading advertisements and public communications, misleading ESG credentials, and false or deceiving carbon credit claims.

After a legal analysis, the corruption and integrity risks in climate solutions reports show that regulations are significantly weaker for misleading ESG credentials than for climate washing and advertising standards. Despite imposed obligations, ESG rating agencies or ESG auditors are not regulated in any reviewed jurisdictions. Factors such as the lack of oversight by third-party environmental service providers, the opacity of internal scoring methodologies, and the lack of alignment and consistency around ESG assessments can create opportunities for misleading or unsubstantiated claims and, worst cases, bribery or fraud.

=== Psychological effects ===
Greenwashing is a relatively new area of research within psychology, and there needs to be more consensus among studies on how greenwashing affects consumers and stakeholders. Because of the variance in country and geography in recently published studies, the discrepancy between consumer behavior in studies could be attributed to cultural or geographic differences.

==== Effect on consumer perception ====
Researchers found that consumers significantly favor environmentally friendly products over their greenwashed counterparts. A survey by LendingTree found that 55% of Americans are willing to spend more money on products they perceive to be more sustainable and eco-friendly.

Consumer perceptions of greenwashing are also mediated by the level of greenwashing they are exposed to. Other research suggests that few consumers notice greenwashing, particularly when they perceive the company or brand as reputable. When consumers perceive green advertising as credible, they develop more positive attitudes towards the brand, even when the advertising is greenwashed.

Other research suggests that consumers with more green concern are more able to tell the difference between honest green marketing and greenwashed advertising; the more green concern, the stronger the intention not to purchase from companies from which they perceive greenwashing advertising behavior. When consumers use word-of-mouth to communicate about a product, green concern strengthens the negative relationship between the consumer&#x27;s intent to purchase and the perception of greenwashing.

Research suggests that consumers distrust companies that greenwash because they view the act as deceptive. If consumers perceive that a company would realistically benefit from a green marketing claim being true, then it is more likely that the claim and the company will be seen as genuine.

Consumers&#x27; willingness to purchase green products decreases when they perceive that green attributes compromise product quality, making greenwashing potentially risky, even when the consumer or stakeholder is not skeptical of green messaging. Words and phrases often used in green messaging and greenwashing, such as &quot;gentle,&quot; can lead consumers to believe the green product is less effective than a non-green option.

==== Attributions of greenwashing ====
Eco-labels can be given to a product from an external organization and the company itself. This has raised concerns because companies can label a product as green or environmentally friendly by selectively disclosing positive attributes of the product while not disclosing environmental harms. Consumers expect to see eco-labels from both internal and external sources but perceive labels from external sources to be more trustworthy. Researchers from the University of Twente found that uncertified or greenwashed internal eco-labels may still contribute to consumer perceptions of a responsible company, with consumers attributing internal motivation to a company&#x27;s internal eco-labeling. Other research connecting attribution theory and greenwashing found that consumers often perceive green advertising as greenwashing when companies use green advertisements, attributing the green messaging to corporate self-interest. Green advertising can backfire, particularly when the advertised environmental claim does not match a company&#x27;s environmental engagement.

==== Implications for green business ====
Researchers working with consumer perception, psychology, and greenwashing note that companies should &quot;walk the walk&quot; regarding green advertising and behavior to avoid the negative connotations and perceptions of greenwashing. Green marketing, labeling, and advertising are most effective when they match a company&#x27;s environmental engagement. This is also mediated by the visibility of those environmental engagements, meaning that if consumers are unaware of a company&#x27;s commitment to sustainability or environmentally-conscious ethos, they cannot factor greenness in their assessment of the company or product.

Exposure to greenwashing can make consumers indifferent to or generate negative feelings toward green marketing. Thus, genuinely green businesses must work harder to differentiate themselves from those who use false claims. Nevertheless, consumers may react negatively to valid sustainability claims because of negative experiences with greenwashing.

Conversely, concerns about the perception of genuine efforts to develop more environmentally friendly practices can lead to &quot;greenhushing&quot;, where a company avoids publicizing these efforts out of concern that they will be accused of greenwashing anyway.

==Deterrence==

Companies may pursue environmental certification to avoid greenwashing through independent verification of their green claims. For example, the Carbon Trust Standard launched in 2007 with the stated aim &quot;to end &#x27;greenwash&#x27; and highlight firms that are genuine about their commitment to the environment.&quot;

There have been attempts to reduce the impact of greenwashing by exposing it to the public. The Greenwashing Index, created by the University of Oregon in partnership with EnviroMedia Social Marketing, allowed the public to upload and rate examples of greenwashing, but it was last updated in 2012.

Research published in the Journal of Business Ethics in 2011 shows that Sustainability Ratings might deter greenwashing. Results concluded that higher sustainability ratings lead to significantly higher brand reputation than lower sustainability ratings. This same trend was found regardless of the company&#x27;s level of corporate social responsibility (CSR) communications. This finding establishes that consumers pay more attention to sustainability ratings than CSR communications or greenwashing claims.

The World Federation of Advertisers released six new guidelines for advertisers in 2022 to prevent greenwashing. These approaches encourage credible environmental claims and more sustainable outcomes. 

==Regulation==

Worldwide regulations on misleading environmental claims vary from criminal liability to fines or voluntary guidelines.

===Australia===

The Australian Trade Practices Act punishes companies that provide misleading environmental claims. Any organization found guilty of such could face up in fines. In addition, the guilty party must pay for all expenses incurred while setting the record straight about their product or company&#x27;s actual environmental impact.

===Canada===

Canada&#x27;s Competition Bureau, along with the Canadian Standards Association, discourage companies from making &quot;vague claims&quot; about their products&#x27; environmental impact. Any claims must be backed up by &quot;readily available data.&quot;

===European Union===

The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) handles investigations that have an environmental or sustainability element, such as the misspending of EU funds intended for green products and the counterfeiting and smuggling of products with the potential to harm the environment and health. It also handles illegal logging and smuggling of precious wood and timber into the EU (wood laundering).

In January 2021, the European Commission, in cooperation with national consumer protection authorities, published a report on its annual survey of consumer websites investigated for violations of EU consumer protection law. The study examined green claims across a wide range of consumer products, concluding that for 42 percent of the websites examined, the claims were likely false and misleading and could well constitute actionable claims for unfair commercial practices.

In the context of escalating concerns regarding the authenticity of corporate ecological sustainability claims, greenwashing has emerged as a significant issue and poses a real challenge to sustainable finance regulations gaps. ESMA outlined the correlation between the growth of ESG-related funds and greenwashing. The exponential rise of funds integrating vague ESG-related language in their names started since the Paris Agreement (2015), and is effective in deceivingly attracting more investors.

The 2020-2024 agenda of DG FISMA concern about greenwashing reconciles two objectives: increasing capital for sustainable investments and bolstering trust and investor protection in European financial markets.

The European Union struck a provisional agreement to mandate new reporting rules for companies with over 250 staff and a turnover of . They must disclose environmental, social, and governance (ESG) information, which will help combat greenwashing. These requirements go into effect in 2024. The European Commission has introduced a proposal of ESG regulation aimed at bolstering transparency and integrity within ESG rating in 2023.
===Germany===
In June 2024, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled that companies that use &quot;climate neutral&quot; in advertising must define what the term means or use of the phrase would not continue to be permitted due to the phrase being too vague.

===Norway===

Norway&#x27;s consumer ombudsman has targeted automakers who claim their cars are &quot;green,&quot; &quot;clean,&quot; or &quot;environmentally friendly,&quot; with some of the world&#x27;s strictest advertising guidelines. Consumer Ombudsman official Bente Øverli said: &quot;Cars cannot do anything good for the environment except less damage than others.&quot; Manufacturers risk fines if they fail to drop misleading advertisements. Øverli said she did not know of other countries going so far in cracking down on cars and the environment.

=== Thailand ===

The Green Leaf Certification is an evaluation method created by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a metric that rates the hotels&#x27; environmental efficiency of environmental protection. In Thailand, this certification is believed to help regulate greenwashing phenomena associated with green hotels. Eco hotel or &quot;green hotel&quot; are hotels that have adopted sustainable, environmentally-friendly practices in hospitality business operations. Since the development of the tourism industry in the ASEAN, Thailand superseded its neighboring countries in inbound tourism, with 9 percent of Thailand&#x27;s direct GDP contributions coming from the travel and tourism industry in 2015. Because of the growth and reliance on tourism as an economic pillar, Thailand developed &quot;responsible tourism&quot; in the 1990s to promote the well-being of local communities and the environment affected by the industry. However, studies show the green hotel companies&#x27; principles and environmental perceptions contradict the basis of corporate social responsibilities in responsible tourism. Against this context, the Green Leaf Certification issuance aims to keep the hotel industry and supply chains accountable for corporate social responsibilities regarding sustainability by having an independent international organization evaluate a hotel and rate it one through five leaves.

===United Kingdom===

The Competition and Markets Authority is the UK&#x27;s primary competition and consumer authority. In September 2021, it published a Green Claims Code to protect consumers from misleading environmental claims and businesses from unfair competition. In May 2024, the Financial Conduct Authority introduced anti-greenwashing rules covering sustainability claims made by regulated firms that market financial products or services.

===United States===

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) provides voluntary guidelines for environmental marketing claims. These guidelines give the FTC the right to prosecute false and misleading claims. These guidelines are not enforceable but instead were intended to be followed voluntarily:
* Qualifications and disclosures: The Commission traditionally has held that to be effective, any qualifications or disclosures such as those described in the green guides should be sufficiently clear, prominent, and understandable to prevent deception. Clarity of language, relative type size and proximity to the claim being qualified, and an absence of contrary claims that could undercut effectiveness, will maximize the likelihood that the qualifications and disclosures are appropriately clear and prominent.
* Distinction between benefits of product, package, and service: An environmental marketing claim should be presented in a way that makes clear whether the environmental attribute or benefit being asserted refers to the product, the product&#x27;s packaging, a service, or to a portion or component of the product, package or service. If the environmental attribute or benefit applies to all but minor, incidental components of a product or package, the claim need not be qualified to identify that fact. There may be exceptions to this general principle. For example, if an unqualified &quot;recyclable&quot; claim is made and the presence of the incidental component significantly limits the ability to recycle the product, then the claim would be deceptive.
* Overstatement of environmental attribute: An environmental marketing claim should not be presented in a manner that overstates the environmental attribute or benefit, expressly or by implication. Marketers should avoid implications of significant environmental benefits if the benefit is negligible.
* Comparative claims: Environmental marketing claims that include a comparative statement should be presented in a manner that makes the basis for the comparison sufficiently clear to avoid consumer deception. In addition, the advertiser should be able to substantiate the comparison.

The FTC announced in 2010 that it would update its guidelines for environmental marketing claims in an attempt to reduce greenwashing. The revision to the FTC&#x27;s Green Guides covers a wide range of public input, including hundreds of consumer and industry comments on previously proposed revisions, offering clear guidance on what constitutes misleading information and demanding clear factual evidence.

According to FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, &quot;The introduction of environmentally-friendly products into the marketplace is a win for consumers who want to purchase greener products and producers who want to sell them.&quot; Leibowitz also says such a win-win can only operate if marketers&#x27; claims are straightforward and proven.

In 2013, the FTC began enforcing these revisions. It cracked down on six different companies; five of the cases concerned false or misleading advertising surrounding the biodegradability of plastics. The FTC charged ECM Biofilms, American Plastic Manufacturing, CHAMP, Clear Choice Housewares, and Carnie Cap, for misrepresenting the biodegradability of their plastics treated with additives.

The FTC charged a sixth company, AJM Packaging Corporation, with violating a commission consent order prohibiting companies from using advertising claims based on the product or packaging being &quot;degradable, biodegradable, or photodegradable&quot; without reliable scientific information. The FTC now requires companies to disclose and provide the information that qualifies their environmental claims to ensure transparency.

=== China ===

The issue of green marketing and consumerism in China has gained significant attention as the country faces environmental challenges. According to &quot;Green Marketing and Consumerism in China: Analyzing the Literature&quot; by Qingyun Zhu and Joseph Sarkis, China has implemented environmental protection laws to regulate the business and commercial sector. Regulations such as the Environmental Protection Law and the Circular Economy Promotion Law contain provisions prohibiting false advertising (known as greenwashing). The Chinese government has issued regulations and standards to regulate green advertising and labeling, including the Guidelines for Green Advertising Certification, the Guidelines for Environmental Labeling and Eco-Product Certification, and the Standards for Environmental Protection Product Declaration. These guidelines promote transparency in green marketing and prevent false or misleading claims. The Guidelines for Green Advertising Certification require that green advertising claims should be truthful, accurate, and verifiable. These guidelines and certifications require that eco-labels should be based on scientific and technical evidence, and should not contain false or misleading information. The standards also require that eco-labels be easy to understand and not confuse or deceive consumers. The regulations that are set in place for greenwashing, green advertising, and labeling in China are designed to protect consumers and prevent misleading claims. China&#x27;s climate crisis, sustainability, and greenwashing remain critical and require ongoing attention. The implementation of regulations and guidelines for green advertising and labeling in China aims to promote transparency and prevent false or misleading claims.

In efforts to stop this practice, in November 2016, the General Office of the State Council introduced legislation to promote the development of green products, encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices, and mention the need for a unified standard for what was to be labeled green. This was a general plan or opinion on the matter, with no specifics on its implementation, however with similarly worded legislation and plans out at that time there was a push toward a unified green product standard. Until then, green products had various standards and guidelines developed by different government agencies or industry associations, resulting in a lack of consistency and coherence. One example of guidelines set then was from the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China (now known as the Ministry of Ecology and Environment). They issued specifications in 2000, but these guidelines were limited and not widely recognized by industry or consumers. It was not until 2017, with the launch of GB/T (a set of national standards and recommendations), that a widespread guideline was set for what would constitute green manufacturing and a green supply chain. Expanding on these guidelines in 2019 the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) created regulations for Green Product Labels, which are symbols used on products to mark that they meet certain environmentally friendly criteria, and certification agencies have verified their manufacturing process. The standards and coverage for green products have increased as time passes, with changes and improvements to green product standardization still occurring in 2023.

In China, the Greenpeace Campaign focuses on the pain point of air pollution. The campaign aims to address the severe air pollution problem prevalent in many Chinese communities. The campaign has been working to raise awareness about air pollution&#x27;s health and environmental impacts, advocate for more robust government policies and regulations to reduce emissions, and encourage a shift toward clean and renewable energy sources. &quot;From 2011 to 2016, we linked global fast fashion brands to toxic chemical pollution in China through their manufacturers. Many multinational companies and local suppliers have stopped using toxic and harmful chemicals. They included Adidas, Benetton, Burberry, Esprit, H&amp;M, Puma, and Zara, among others.&quot; The Greenpeace Campaign in China has involved various activities, including scientific research, public education, and advocacy efforts. The campaign has organized public awareness events to engage both consumers and policymakers, urging them to take action to improve air quality. &quot;In recent years, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping has committed to controlling the expansion of coal power plants. He has also pledged to stop building new coal power abroad&quot;. The campaign seeks to drive public and government interest toward more strict air pollution control measures, promote more clean energy technology, and contribute to health, wellness, and sustainability in China. However, the health of Chinese citizens is at the forefront of this issue, as air pollution is a critical issue in the nation. The article emphasizes that China has prioritized putting people front and center on environmental issues. China&#x27;s Greenpeace campaigns and those in other countries are a part of their global efforts to address environmental challenges and promote sustainability.

&quot;Bluewashing&quot; is a similar term. However, instead of falsely advertising environmentally friendly practices, companies are advertising corporate social responsibility. For example, companies are saying they are fighting for human rights while practicing very unethical production practices such as paying factory employees next to nothing.

Carbon emission trading can be similar to greenwashing in that it gives an environmentally-friendly impression, but can be counterproductive if carbon is priced too low, or if large emitters are given &quot;free credits.&quot; For example, Bank of America subsidiary MBNA offers &quot;Eco-Logique&quot; MasterCards that reward Canadian customers with carbon offsets when they use them. Customers may feel that they are nullifying their carbon footprint by purchasing goods with these, but only 0.5% of the purchase price goes to buy carbon offsets; the rest of the interchange fee still goes to the bank.

=== Greenscamming ===

Greenscamming describes an organization or product taking on a name that falsely implies environmental friendliness. It is related to both greenwashing and greenspeak. This is analogous to aggressive mimicry in biology.

Greenscamming is used in particular by industrial companies and associations that deploy astroturfing organisations to try to dispute scientific findings that threaten their business model. One example is the denial of man-made global warming by companies in the fossil energy sector, also driven by specially-founded greenscamming organizations.

One reason to establish greenscamming organizations is that openly communicating the benefits of activities that damage the environment is difficult. Sociologist Charles Harper stresses that marketing a group called &quot;Coalition to Trash the Environment for Profit&quot; would be difficult. Anti-environment initiatives, therefore, must give their front organizations deliberately deceptive names if they want to be successful, as surveys show that environmental protection has a social consensus. However, the danger of being exposed as an anti-environmental initiative entails a considerable risk that the greenscamming activities will backfire and be counterproductive for the initiators.

Greenscamming organizations are active in organized climate denial. An important financier of greenscamming organizations was the oil company ExxonMobil, which financially supported more than 100 climate denial organizations and spent about 20 million U.S. dollars on greenscamming groups. James Lawrence Powell identified the &quot;admirable&quot; designations of many of these organizations as the most striking common feature, which for the most part sounded very rational. He quotes a list of climate denial organizations drawn up by the Union of Concerned Scientists, which includes 43 organizations funded by Exxon. None had a name that would lead one to infer that climate change denial was their &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;. The list is headed by Africa Fighting Malaria, whose website features articles and commentaries opposing ambitious climate mitigation concepts, even though the dangers of malaria could be exacerbated by global warming.

==== Examples ====

Examples of greenscamming organizations include the National Wetlands Coalition, Friends of Eagle Mountain, The Sahara Club, The Alliance for Environment and Resources, The Abundant Wildlife Society of North America, the Global Climate Coalition, the National Wilderness Institute, the Environmental Policy Alliance of the Center for Organizational Research and Education, and the American Council on Science and Health. Behind these ostensible environmental protection organizations lie the interests of business sectors. For example, oil drilling companies and real estate developers support the National Wetlands Coalition. In contrast, the Friends of Eagle Mountain is backed by a mining company that wants to convert open-cast mines into landfills. The Global Climate Coalition was backed by commercial enterprises that fought against government-imposed climate protection measures. Other Greenscam organizations include the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, backed by the nuclear industry; the Wilderness Impact Research Foundation, representing the interests of loggers and ranchers; and the American Environmental Foundation, representing the interests of landowners.

Another Greenscam organization is the Northwesterners for More Fish, which had a budget of $2.6 million in 1998. This group opposed conservation measures for endangered fish that restricted the interests of energy companies, aluminum companies, and the region&#x27;s timber industry and tried to discredit environmentalists who promoted fish habitats. The Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, the National Environmental Policy Institute, and the Information Council on the Environment funded by the coal industry are also greenscamming organizations.

In Germany, this form of mimicry or deception is used by the &quot;European Institute for Climate and Energy&quot; (EIKE), which suggests by its name that it is an important scientific research institution. In fact, EIKE is not a scientific institution at all, but a lobby organization that neither has an office nor employs climate scientists, but instead disseminates fake news on climate issues on its website.

<text>The 1666 census of New France was the first census conducted in Canada (and also North America) for the Kingdom of France. It was organized by Jean Talon, the first Intendant of New France, between 1665 and 1666.

Talon and the French Minister of the Marine Jean-Baptiste Colbert had brought the colony of New France under direct royal control in 1663, and Colbert wished to make it the centre of the French colonial empire. To do this he needed to know the state of the population so that the economic and industrial basis of the colony could be expanded. The next New France census was in 1667.

==Collection==

Jean-Talon conducted the census largely by himself, travelling door-to-door among the settlements of New France. He did not include Native American inhabitants of the colony, or the religious orders such as the Jesuits or Recollets.

==Results==
According to Talon&#x27;s census there were 3,215 people in New France, and 538 separate families. The census showed a difference in the number of men at 2,034 versus 1,181 women. Children and unwedded adults were grouped together; there were 2,154 of these, while only 1,019 people were married (42 were widowed).
A total of 625 people lived in Montreal, the largest settlement; 547 people lived in Quebec; and 455 lived in Trois-Rivières. The largest single age group, 21- to 30-year-olds, numbered 842. 763 people were professionals of some kind, and 401 of these were servants, while 16 were listed as &quot;gentlemen of means&quot;.

==Other censuses==
After the 1665–1666 census the next census was conducted in 1667, a total of 36 full censuses and 9 partial censuses taken during the French regime until 1763.

<text>Herbert Frank York (24 November 1921 – 19 May 2009) was an American nuclear physicist of Mohawk origin. He held numerous research and administrative positions at various United States government and educational institutes.

==Biography==

Herbert York was born to a family of Mohawk ancestry, in Rochester, New York. He received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Rochester in 1943, and then went on to obtain his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1949. His dissertation advisor was future Nobel laureate Emilio Segrè, and Robert Oppenheimer taught York&#x27;s quantum mechanics class. During World War II, he was a physicist at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, working alongside Frank Oppenheimer as part of the Manhattan Project. After a brief stint as an assistant professor of physics at his doctoral alma mater in 1951, he was selected by Ernest Lawrence to serve as the inaugural director of the University of California Radiation Laboratory, Livermore Branch (1952–1958). 

Upon leaving Livermore, he held important positions in government for the remainder of the Eisenhower administration, becoming the first chief scientist of the Advanced Research Projects Agency and the first director of Defense Research and Engineering. During this period, he &quot;gradually became concerned that the United States and the Soviet Union were developing more weapons yet becoming less secure and that the shortened response times to a pre-emptive nuclear strike would put nuclear decision making in the hands of low-level military officers or, ultimately, computers,&quot; according to William J. Broad of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, prompting his lifelong advocacy as a member of the anti-nuclear movement.

He was the founding chancellor of the University of California, San Diego (1961–1964), where he remained on the physics faculty for the rest of his career, later serving as the institution&#x27;s acting chancellor (1970–1972) amid the search for William J. McGill&#x27;s successor. An advisor to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in the 1960s, he returned to government service in earnest as the U.S. delegate to the Comprehensive Test Ban negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland (1979–1981); as part of this role, he was the chief U.S. negotiator in the unsuccessful effort to impose a comprehensive U.S.-Soviet nuclear test ban.

York was director emeritus of the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation at UC San Diego and served as chairman of the university&#x27;s Scientific and Academic Advisory Committee, which oversees activities at both Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories. He also served on the board of the Council for a Livable World, a nonpartisan arms control organization in Washington, D.C. York occasionally guest lectured for UC San Diego and other institutions.

York died 19 May 2009 in San Diego at age 87.

<doc id="325260" wikidata="Q1130510" url="?curid=325260" title="Figurate number">
<text>The term figurate number is used by different writers for members of different sets of numbers, generalizing from triangular numbers to different shapes (polygonal numbers) and different dimensions (polyhedral numbers). The term can mean

* polygonal number
* a number represented as a discrete -dimensional regular geometric pattern of -dimensional balls such as a polygonal number (for ) or a polyhedral number (for ).
* a member of the subset of the sets above containing only triangular numbers, pyramidal numbers, and their analogs in other dimensions.

== Terminology ==

Some kinds of figurate number were discussed in the 16th and 17th centuries under the name &quot;figural number&quot;.

In historical works about Greek mathematics the preferred term used to be &quot;figured number&quot;.

In a use going back to Jacob Bernoulli&#x27;s Ars Conjectandi, the term &quot;figurate number&quot; is used for triangular numbers made up of successive integers, tetrahedral numbers made up of successive triangular numbers, etc. These turn out to be the binomial coefficients. In this usage the square numbers (4, 9, 16, 25, ...) would not be considered figurate numbers when viewed as arranged in a square.

A number of other sources use the term &quot;figurate number&quot; as synonymous for the polygonal numbers, either just the usual kind or both those and the centered polygonal numbers.

== History ==

The mathematical study of figurate numbers is said to have originated with Pythagoras, possibly based on Babylonian or Egyptian precursors. Generating whichever class of figurate numbers the Pythagoreans studied using gnomons is also attributed to Pythagoras. Unfortunately, there is no trustworthy source for these claims, because all surviving writings about the Pythagoreans are from centuries later. Speusippus is the earliest source to expose the view that ten, as the fourth triangular number, was in fact the tetractys, supposed to be of great importance for Pythagoreanism. Figurate numbers were a concern of the Pythagorean worldview. It was well understood that some numbers could have many figurations, e.g. 36 is a both a square and a triangle and also various rectangles.

The modern study of figurate numbers goes back to Pierre de Fermat, specifically the Fermat polygonal number theorem. Later, it became a significant topic for Euler, who gave an explicit formula for all triangular numbers that are also perfect squares, among many other discoveries relating to figurate numbers.

Figurate numbers have played a significant role in modern recreational mathematics. In research mathematics, figurate numbers are studied by way of the Ehrhart polynomials, polynomials that count the number of integer points in a polygon or polyhedron when it is expanded by a given factor.

== Triangular numbers and their analogs in higher dimensions ==

The triangular numbers for are the result of the juxtaposition of the linear numbers (linear gnomons) for :
These are the binomial coefficients formula_1. This is the case of the fact that the th diagonal of Pascal&#x27;s triangle for consists of the figurate numbers for the -dimensional analogs of triangles (-dimensional simplices).

The simplicial polytopic numbers for are:
*formula_2 (linear numbers),
*formula_3 (triangular numbers),
*formula_4 (tetrahedral numbers),
*formula_5 (pentachoric numbers, pentatopic numbers, 4-simplex numbers),
formula_6
*formula_7 (-topic numbers, -simplex numbers).

The terms &quot;square number&quot; and &quot;cubic number&quot; derive from their geometric representation as a square or cube. The difference of two positive triangular numbers is a trapezoidal number.

== Gnomon ==

The gnomon is the piece added to a figurate number to transform it to the next larger one.

For example, the gnomon of the square number is the odd number, of the general form , . The square of size 8 composed of gnomons looks like this:

:formula_8

To transform from the &quot;-square&quot; (the square of size ) to the -square, one adjoins elements: one to the end of each row ( elements), one to the end of each column ( elements), and a single one to the corner. For example, when transforming the 7-square to the 8-square, we add 15 elements; these adjunctions are the 8s in the above figure.

This gnomonic technique also provides a mathematical proof that the sum of the first odd numbers is ; the figure illustrates = 64 = 82.

There is a similar gnomon with centered hexagonal numbers adding up to make cubes of each integer number.

<text>The word ‘dynamics’ appears frequently in discussions and writing about strategy, and is used in two distinct, though equally important senses.

The dynamics of strategy and performance concerns the ‘content’ of strategy – initiatives, choices, policies and decisions adopted in an attempt to improve performance, and the results that arise from these managerial behaviors.

The dynamic model of the strategy process is a way of understanding how strategic actions occur. It recognizes that strategic planning is dynamic, that is, strategy-making involves a complex pattern of actions and reactions. It is partially planned and partially unplanned.

A literature search shows the first of these senses to be both the earliest and most widely used meaning of ‘strategy dynamics’, though that is not to diminish the importance of the dynamic view of the strategy process.

== Static models of strategy and performance ==

The static assessment of strategy and performance, and its tools and frameworks dominate research, 
textbooks and practice in the field. They stem from a presumption dating back to before the 1980s that market and industry conditions determine how firms in a sector perform on average, and the scope for any firm to do better or worse than that average. E.g. the airline industry is notoriously unprofitable, but some firms are spectacularly profitable exceptions.

The ‘industry forces’ paradigm was established most firmly by Michael Porter, (1980) in his seminal book ‘Competitive Strategy’, the ideas of which still form the basis of strategy analysis in many consulting firms and investment companies.
Richard Rumelt (1991) was amongst the first to challenge this presumption of the power of ‘industry forces’, and it has since become well understood that business factors are more important drivers of performance than are industry factors – in essence, this means you can do well in difficult industries, and struggle in industries where others do well. Although the relative importance of industry factors and firm-specific factors continues to be researched, the debate is now essentially over – management of strategy matters.

The increasing interest in how some businesses in an industry perform better than others led to the emergence of the ‘resource based view’ (RBV) of strategy (Wernerfelt, 1984; Barney, 1991; Grant, 1991), which seeks to discover the firm-specific sources of superior performance – an interest that has increasingly come to dominate research.

== The need for a dynamic model of strategy and performance ==

The debate about the relative influence of industry and business factors on performance, and the RBV-based explanations for superior performance both, however, pass over a more serious problem. This concerns exactly what the ‘performance’ &quot;is&quot; that management seeks to improve. Would you prefer, for example, (A) to make $15m per year indefinitely, or (B) $12m this year, increasing by 20% a year, starting with the same resources?

Nearly half a century ago, Edith Penrose (1959) pointed out that superior profitability (e.g. return on sales or return on assets) was neither interesting to investors – who value the prospect of increasing future cash flows – nor sustainable over time. Profitability is not entirely unimportant – it does after all provide the investment in new resources to enable growth to occur. More recently, Rugman and Verbeke (2002) have reviewed the implications of this observation for research in strategy. Richard Rumelt (2007) has again raised the importance of making progress with the issue of strategy dynamics, describing it as still ‘the next frontier … underresearched, underwritten about, and underunderstood’.

The essential problem is that tools explaining why firm A performs better than firm B at a point in time are unlikely to explain why firm B is growing its performance more rapidly than firm A.

This is not just of theoretical concern, but matters to executives too – efforts by the management of firm B to match A’s profitability could well destroy its ability to grow profits, for example. A further practical problem is that many of the static frameworks do not provide sufficiently fine-grained guidance on strategy to help raise performance. For example, an investigation that identifies an attractive opportunity to serve a specific market segment with specific products or services, delivered in a particular way is unlikely to yield fundamentally different answers from one year to the next. Yet strategic management has much to do from month to month to ensure the business system develops strongly so as to take that opportunity quickly and safely.
What is needed, is a set of tools that explain how performance changes over time, and how to improve its future trajectory – i.e. a dynamic model of strategy and performance. 

&lt;br&gt;

==A possible dynamic model of strategy and performance==

To develop a dynamic model of strategy and performance requires components that explain how factors change over time. Most of the relationships on which business analysis are based describe relationships that are static and stable over time. For example, “profits = revenue minus costs”, or “market share = our sales divided by total market size” are relationships that are true. Static strategy tools seek to solve the strategy problem by extending this set of stable relationships, e.g. “profitability = some complex function of product development capability”.
Since a company’s sales clearly change over time, there must be something further back up the causal chain that makes this happen. One such item is ‘customers’ – if the firm has more customers now than last month, then (everything else being equal), it will have more sales and profits.

The number of ‘Customers’ at any time, however, cannot be calculated from anything else. It is one example of a factor with a unique characteristic, known as an ‘asset-stock’. This critical feature is that it accumulates over time, so “customers today = customers yesterday +/- customers won and lost”. This is not a theory or statistical observation, but is axiomatic of the way the world works. Other examples include cash (changed by cash-in and cash-out-flows), staff (changed by hiring and attrition), capacity, product range and dealers. Many intangible factors behave in the same way, e.g. reputation and staff skills.
Dierickx and Cool (1989) point out that this causes serious problems for explaining performance over time:
* &quot;Time compression diseconomies&quot; i.e. it takes time to accumulate resources.
* &quot;Asset Mass Efficiencies&quot; ‘the more you have, the faster you can get more’..
* &quot;Interconnectedness of Asset Stocks&quot; .. building one resource depends on other resources already in place.
* &quot;Asset erosion&quot; .. tangible and intangible assets alike deteriorate unless effort and expenditure are committed to maintaining them
* &quot;Causal ambiguity&quot; .. it can be hard to work out, even for the firm who owns a resource, why exactly it accumulates and depletes at the rate it does.

The consequences of these features is that relationships in a business system are highly non-linear. Statistical analysis will not, then, be able meaningfully to confirm any causal explanation for the number of customers at any moment in time. If that is true then statistical analysis also cannot say anything useful about any performance that depends on customers or on other accumulating asset-stocks – which is always the case.

Fortunately, a method known as system dynamics captures both the math of asset-stock accumulation (i.e. resource- and capability-building), and the interdependence between these components (Forrester, 1961; Sterman, 2000).
The asset-stocks relevant to strategy performance are resources [things we have] and capabilities [things we are good at doing]. This makes it possible to connect back to the resource-based view, though with one modification. RBV asserts that any resource which is clearly identifiable, and can easily be acquired or built, cannot be a source of competitive advantage, so only resources or capabilities that are valuable, rare, hard to imitate or buy, and embedded in the organization [the ‘VRIO’ criteria] can be relevant to explaining performance, for example reputation or product development capability. Yet day-to-day performance must reflect the simple, tangible resources such as customers, capacity and cash. VRIO resources may be important also, but it is not possible to trace a causal path from reputation or product development capability to performance outcomes without going via the tangible resources of customers and cash.

Warren (2002, 2007) brought together the specification of resources [tangible and intangible] and capabilities with the math of system dynamics to assemble a framework for strategy dynamics and performance with the following elements:
* Performance, &quot;P&quot;, at time &quot;t&quot; is a function of the quantity of resources &quot;R1&quot; to &quot;Rn&quot;, discretionary management choices, &quot;M&quot;, and exogenous factors, &quot;E&quot;, at that time (Equation 1).
(1) &quot;P&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = f{&quot;R1(&quot;t&quot;)&quot;, .. &quot;Rn(&quot;t&quot;)&quot;, &quot;M&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;E&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)} 
* The current quantity of each resource &quot;Ri&quot; at time &quot;t&quot; is its level at time &quot;t-1&quot; plus or minus any resource-flows that have occurred between &quot;t-1&quot; and &quot;t&quot; (Equation 2).
(2) &quot;Ri&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;Ri&quot; (&quot;t-1&quot;) +/- formula_1 &quot;Ri&quot;(&quot;t-1&quot; .. &quot;t&quot;) 
* The change in quantity of &quot;Ri&quot; between time &quot;t-1&quot; and time &quot;t&quot; is a function of the quantity of resources &quot;R1&quot; to &quot;Rn&quot; at time &quot;t-1&quot;, including that of resource &quot;Ri&quot; itself, on management choices, &quot;M&quot;, and on exogenous factors &quot;E&quot; at that time (Equation 3).
(3) formula_1 &quot;Ri&quot;(&quot;t-1&quot; .. &quot;t&quot;) = f{&quot;R1&quot;(&quot;t-1&quot;), .. &quot;Rn&quot;(&quot;t-1&quot;), &quot;M&quot;(&quot;t-1&quot;), &quot;E&quot;(&quot;t-1&quot;)} 

This set of relationships gives rise to an ‘architecture’ that depicts, both graphically and mathematically, the core of how a business or other organization develops and performs over time. To this can be added other important extensions, including :
* the consequence of resources varying in one or more qualities or ‘attributes’ [e.g. customer size, staff experience]
* the development of resources through stages [disloyal and loyal customers, junior and senior staff]
* rivalry for any resource that may be contested [customers clearly, but also possibly staff and other factors]
* intangible factors [e.g. reputation, staff skills]
* capabilities [e.g. product development, selling]

== The Static Model of the Strategy Process ==

According to many introductory strategy textbooks, strategic thinking can be divided into two segments : strategy formulation and strategy implementation. Strategy formulation is done first, followed by implementation.

Strategy formulation involves:
# Doing a situation analysis: both internal and external; both micro-environmental and macro-environmental.
# Concurrent with this assessment, objectives are set. This involves crafting vision statements (long term), mission statements (medium term), overall corporate objectives (both financial and strategic), strategic business unit objectives (both financial and strategic), and tactical objectives.
# These objectives should, in the light of the situation analysis, suggest a strategic plan. The plan provides the details of how to obtain these goals.
This three-step strategy formation process is sometimes referred to as determining where you are now, determining where you want to go, and then determining how to get there.

The next phase, according to this linear model is the implementation of the strategy. This involves:
* Allocation of sufficient resources (financial, personnel, time, computer system support)
* Establishing a chain of command or some alternative structure (such as cross-functional teams)
* Assigning responsibility of specific tasks or processes to specific individuals or groups
* Managing the process. This includes monitoring results, comparing to benchmarks and best practices, evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of the process, controlling for variances, and making adjustments to the process as necessary.
* When implementing specific programs, this involves acquiring the requisite resources, developing the process, training, process testing, documentation, and integration with (and/or conversion from) legacy processes

==The Dynamic Model of the Strategy Process==

Several theorists have recognized a problem with this static model of the strategy process: it is not how strategy is developed in real life. Strategy is actually a dynamic and interactive process. Some of the earliest challenges to the planned strategy approach came from Linblom in the 1960s and Quinn in the 1980s.

Charles Lindblom (1959) claimed that strategy is a fragmented process of serial and incremental decisions. He viewed strategy as an informal process of mutual adjustment with little apparent coordination.

James Brian Quinn (1978) developed an approach that he called &quot;logical incrementalism&quot;. He claimed that strategic management involves guiding actions and events towards a conscious strategy in a step-by-step process. Managers nurture and promote strategies that are themselves changing. In regard to the nature of strategic management he says: &quot;&quot;Constantly integrating the simultaneous incremental process of strategy formulation and implementation is the central art of effective strategic management&quot;.&quot; (page 145). Whereas Lindblom saw strategy as a disjointed process without conscious direction, Quinn saw the process as fluid but controllable.

Joseph Bower (1970) and Robert Burgelman (1980) took this one step further. Not only are strategic decisions made incrementally rather than as part of a grand unified vision, but according to them, this multitude of small decisions are made by numerous people in all sections and levels of the organization.

Henry Mintzberg (1978) made a distinction between deliberate strategy and emergent strategy. Emergent strategy originates not in the mind of the strategist, but in the interaction of the organization with its environment. He claims that emergent strategies tend to exhibit a type of convergence in which ideas and actions from multiple sources integrate into a pattern. This is a form of organizational learning, in fact, on this view, organizational learning is one of the core functions of any business enterprise (See Peter Senge&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Discipline&quot; (1990).)

Constantinos Markides (1999) describes strategy formation and implementation as an ongoing, never-ending, integrated process requiring continuous reassessment and reformation.

A particularly insightful model of strategy process dynamics comes from J. Moncrieff (1999). He recognized that strategy is partially deliberate and partially unplanned, though whether the resulting performance is better for being planned or not is unclear. The unplanned element comes from two sources : “emergent strategies” result from the emergence of opportunities and threats in the environment and “Strategies in action” are ad hoc actions by many people from all parts of the organization. These multitudes of small actions are typically not intentional, not teleological, not formal, and not even recognized as strategic. They are emergent from within the organization, in much the same way as “emergent strategies” are emergent from the environment. However, it is again not clear whether, or under what circumstances, strategies would be better if more planned.

In this model, strategy is both planned and emergent, dynamic, and interactive. Five general processes interact. They are strategic intention, the organization&#x27;s response to emergent environmental issues, the dynamics of the actions of individuals within the organization, the alignment of action with strategic intent, and strategic learning.

The alignment of action with strategic intent (the top line in the diagram), is the blending of strategic intent, emergent strategies, and strategies in action, to produce strategic outcomes. The continuous monitoring of these strategic outcomes produces strategic learning (the bottom line in the diagram). This learning comprises feedback into internal processes, the environment, and strategic intentions. Thus the complete system amounts to a triad of continuously self-regulating feedback loops. Actually, quasi self-regulating is a more appropriate term since the feedback loops can be ignored by the organization. The system is self-adjusting only to the extent that the organization is prepared to learn from the strategic outcomes it creates. This requires effective leadership and an agile, questioning, corporate culture. In this model, the distinction between strategy formation and strategy implementation disappears.

==Criticisms of Dynamic Strategy Process Models==

Some detractors claim that these models are too complex to teach. No one will understand the model until they see it in action. Accordingly, the two part linear categorization scheme is probably more valuable in textbooks and lectures.

Also, there are some implementation decisions that do not fit a dynamic model. They include specific project implementations. In these cases implementation is exclusively tactical and often routinized. Strategic intent and dynamic interactions influence the decision only indirectly.

<text>Joseph Charboneau (born June 17, 1955) is an American former professional baseball left fielder and designated hitter who played three seasons with the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB) in the early 1980s.

After winning the AL Rookie of the Year award in 1980, Charboneau&#x27;s career quickly flamed out amidst injuries, specifically a back ailment that never properly healed and restricted him for the next three years. He is one of the most oft-cited examples of baseball&#x27;s fabled sophomore jinx, holding the record for the fewest career games played in the Major Leagues by a Rookie of the Year, with 201.

==Early life==
Charboneau was born fifth of seven children. When he was young, his family relocated to Santa Clara, California and his father left the family shortly thereafter. He was raised in poverty by his single mother who worked as a hospital receptionist. In order to make money, Charboneau would fight in illegal bare-knuckle boxing matches in boxcars and warehouses. He broke his nose and was stabbed three times apiece.

Charboneau attended and played baseball for Buchser High School in Santa Clara. He was not highly recruited by colleges or scouted by professional teams. While still in high school, he did get the attention of Philadelphia Phillies scout Eddie Bockman, who attended one of Charboneau&#x27;s games in order to scout his teammate, Steve Bartkowski.

== Baseball career ==
===Early career===
Bockman continued to keep tabs on Charboneau while he played college baseball at West Valley College. The 21-year-old Charboneau was originally drafted in the sixth round of the June 1976 draft by the Minnesota Twins, but he did not sign with them; when Bockman&#x27;s Philadelphia Phillies made him their second-round pick in the December supplementary draft, Charboneau was sent to the Class A Western Carolina League, where he hit .298 in 43 games.

In 1977, Charboneau suddenly quit the Phillies&#x27; Carolina League affiliate after fighting with management, and went home to work as a stock clerk and play softball. The following year, Minnesota, the team that originally drafted Charboneau, gave him another chance and assigned him to Visalia of the California League. He responded with a .350 average, fourth-best in the league. At season&#x27;s end, though, after participating in a barroom brawl, Charboneau was traded to the Cleveland Indians organization for major-league pitcher Cardell Camper.

===&quot;Super Joe&quot;===
Charboneau broke out in 1979 with a .352 average for the Indians&#x27; AA team in Chattanooga, pacing the Southern League.

In 1980, it looked like Charboneau was headed up to AAA Charleston—until Indians&#x27; slugger Andre Thornton was felled by a knee injury, giving Joe his shot at the big leagues.

Trouble continued to follow him; while in Mexico for an exhibition game on March 8, a crazed fan stuck Charboneau with a pen knife. The knife penetrated four inches and hit a rib, but Charboneau played his first regular-season game just over a month later, on April 11. (The assailant was duly arrested and fined 50 pesos. &quot;That&#x27;s $2.27 for stabbing a person,&quot; Charboneau said.)

Charboneau soon became a fan favorite. Long before Dennis Rodman came on the scene, Charboneau became known for dyeing his hair, as well as his unusual way of consuming beer: through his nose. Other stories emerged about how he did his own dental work and fixed a broken nose with a pair of pliers and a few shots of Jack Daniel&#x27;s whiskey, stood out; by mid-season, Charboneau was the subject of a song, &quot;Go Joe Charboneau&quot;, that reached #3 on the local charts.

Despite a few nagging injures late in the season, Charboneau played 131 games in 1980, splitting time between left field and designated hitter. His .289 average coupled with 23 home runs and 87 RBI (leading the team in both categories) earned Charboneau the American League Rookie of the Year award, making him the first Indian to claim the award since Chris Chambliss in 1971.

===Decline===
Charboneau injured his back in a headfirst slide in spring training the following year. He tried to play through the pain but was hitting only .208 at the time of the 1981 Major League Baseball strike that interrupted the season. Just after the players came back in early August, though, Charboneau was sent to AAA Charleston, making him the first Rookie-of-the-Year to be returned the minors the following season. After 18 games with the Charlies (where he hit just .217), he returned to the big club on August 28. His final big-league numbers for 1981: .210 average, just four homers and 18 RBI in 138 at-bats. Charboneau underwent back surgery over the winter.

Things did not improve for Charboneau in 1982: after only 22 games with the Indians, Charboneau and his .214 average were shipped back to Charleston, then to AA Chattanooga again. Playing in the same league he had torn apart three years earlier, he could only manage a dismal .207 mark. Charboneau endured another back surgery after the season, but seemingly nothing could allow him to regain his timing at the plate. Finally, in 1983, when batting .200 for AA Buffalo, Charboneau gave jeering fans an obscene gesture, leading to his quick release.

However, the Pittsburgh Pirates took a flyer on him in 1984, and he managed a .289 average in the Carolina League (though at 29, he was easily the oldest player in the loop). A shot with the Pirates AAA team in Hawaii ended after 15 games, and &quot;Super Joe&quot; retired from the game. (Charboneau did make one more appearance in a baseball uniform that year, but only on celluloid; he was an extra in the film &quot;The Natural&quot;, playing one of Roy Hobbs&#x27; teammates.)

==After baseball==
Charboneau dabbled in sports management after his retirement, and even hosted his own radio show for a time. He returned to baseball in 1999 with the Canton Crocodiles of the Frontier League, serving as hitting instructor, first base coach, and director of baseball operations through 2001. (He even stepped in as a pinch-hitter in 2000, hitting a single in his only at-bat.) He later worked for several other Frontier League teams in Washington, Windy City, Richmond and Chillicothe.

Charboneau had been the manager of the Lorain County Ironmen, a team playing in the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League, a wood bat league allowing college players to play competitive baseball in the off-season. Charboneau was hired to manage the Ironmen by close friend and fellow former Cleveland Indians outfielder Kevin Rhomberg, who owned the team. However, the Ironmen folded after the 2019 season.

Prior to managing the Ironmen, Charboneau spent the 2014 baseball season as the hitting coach for the Lake Erie Crushers of the independent Frontier League.

He has been the hitting coach at Notre Dame College in South Euclid, Ohio since 2016.

==Personal life==
Charboneau lives in North Ridgeville, Ohio with his wife Ellen. He has two children, Tyson (born 1979) and Dannon (born 1981) and six grandchildren.

It was reported in 2020 that Charboneau suffered a stroke in August of that year but was recovering.

<doc id="325329" wikidata="Q8683" url="?curid=325329" title="Cold War">
<text>The Cold War was a period of global geopolitical rivalry between the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR) and their respective allies, the capitalist Western Bloc and communist Eastern Bloc, which lasted from 1947 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The term &quot;cold war&quot; is used because there was no direct fighting between the two superpowers, though each supported opposing sides in regional conflicts known as proxy wars. In addition to the struggle for ideological and economic influence and an arms race in both conventional and nuclear weapons, the Cold War was expressed through technological rivalries such as the Space Race, espionage, propaganda campaigns, embargoes, and sports diplomacy.

After the end of World War II in 1945, during which the US and USSR had been allies, the USSR installed satellite governments in its occupied territories in Eastern Europe and North Korea by 1949, resulting in the political division of Europe (and Germany) by an &quot;Iron Curtain&quot;. The USSR tested its first nuclear weapon in 1949, four years after their use by the US at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and allied with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, founded in 1949. The US declared the Truman Doctrine of &quot;containment&quot; of communism in 1947, launched the Marshall Plan in 1948 to assist Western Europe&#x27;s economic recovery, and founded the NATO military alliance in 1949 (matched by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact in 1955). The Berlin Blockade of 1948 to 1949 was an early confrontation, as was the Korean War of 1950 to 1953, which ended in a stalemate. 

US involvement in regime change during the Cold War included support for anti-communist and right-wing dictatorships and uprisings, while Soviet involvement included the funding of left-wing parties, wars of independence, and dictatorships. As nearly all the colonial states underwent decolonization, many became Third World battlefields of the Cold War. Both powers used economic aid in an attempt to win the loyalty of non-aligned countries. The Cuban Revolution of 1959 installed the first communist regime in the Western Hemisphere, and in 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis began after deployments of US missiles in Europe and Soviet missiles in Cuba; it is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into nuclear war. Another major proxy conflict was the Vietnam War of 1955 to 1975, which ended in defeat for the US. 

The USSR solidified its domination of Eastern Europe with its crushing of the Hungarian Revolution in 1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Relations between the USSR and China broke down by 1961, with the Sino-Soviet split bringing the two states to the brink of war amid a border conflict in 1969. In 1972, the US initiated diplomatic contacts with China and the US and USSR signed a series of treaties limiting their nuclear arsenals during a period known as détente. In 1979, the toppling of US-allied governments in Iran and Nicaragua and the outbreak of the Soviet–Afghan War again raised tensions. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the USSR and expanded political freedoms, which contributed to the revolutions of 1989 in the Eastern Bloc and the collapse of the USSR in 1991, ending the Cold War.

==Terminology==
Writer George Orwell used &quot;cold war&quot;, as a general term, in his essay &quot;You and the Atomic Bomb&quot;, published 19 October 1945. Contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of nuclear warfare, Orwell looked at James Burnham&#x27;s predictions of a polarized world, writing:
In &quot;The Observer&quot; of 10 March 1946, Orwell wrote, &quot;after the Moscow conference last December, Russia began to make a &#x27;cold war&#x27; on Britain and the British Empire.&quot;

The first use of the term to describe the specific post-war geopolitical confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States came in a speech by Bernard Baruch, an influential advisor to Democratic presidents, on 16 April 1947. The speech, written by journalist Herbert Bayard Swope, proclaimed, &quot;we are today in the midst of a cold war.&quot; Newspaper columnist Walter Lippmann gave the term wide currency with his book &quot;The Cold War&quot;. When asked in 1947 about the source of the term, Lippmann traced it to a French term from the 1930s, .

==Background and periodization==

The roots of the Cold War can be traced to diplomatic and military tensions preceding World War II. The 1917 Russian Revolution and the subsequent Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, where Soviet Russia ceded vast territories to Germany, deepened distrust among the Western Allies. Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War further complicated relations, and although the Soviet Union later allied with Western powers to defeat Nazi Germany, this cooperation was strained by mutual suspicions.

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, disagreements about the future of Europe, particularly Eastern Europe, became central. The Soviet Union&#x27;s establishment of communist regimes in the countries it had liberated from Nazi control—enforced by the presence of the Red Army—alarmed the US and UK. Western leaders saw this as Soviet expansionism, clashing with their vision of a democratic Europe. Economically, the divide was sharpened with the introduction of the Marshall Plan in 1947, a US initiative to provide financial aid to rebuild Europe and prevent the spread of communism by stabilizing capitalist economies. The Soviet Union rejected the Marshall Plan, seeing it as an effort by the US to impose its influence on Europe. In response, the Soviet Union established Comecon (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance) to foster economic cooperation among communist states.

The United States and its Western European allies sought to strengthen their bonds and used the policy of containment against Soviet influence; they accomplished this most notably through the formation of NATO, which was essentially a defensive agreement in 1949. The Soviet Union countered with the Warsaw Pact in 1955, which had similar results with the Eastern Bloc. As by that time the Soviet Union already had an armed presence and political domination all over its eastern satellite states, the pact has been long considered superfluous. Although nominally a defensive alliance, the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s primary function was to safeguard Soviet hegemony over its Eastern European satellites, with the pact&#x27;s only direct military actions having been the invasions of its own member states to keep them from breaking away; in the 1960s, the pact evolved into a multilateral alliance, in which the non-Soviet Warsaw Pact members gained significant scope to pursue their own interests. In 1961, Soviet-allied East Germany constructed the Berlin Wall to prevent the citizens of East Berlin from fleeing to West Berlin, at the time part of United States-allied West Germany. Major crises of this phase included the Berlin Blockade of 1948–1949, the Chinese Communist Revolution of 1945–1949, the Korean War of 1950–1953, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Suez Crisis of that same year, the Berlin Crisis of 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, and the Vietnam War of 1955–1975. Both superpowers competed for influence in Latin America and the Middle East, and the decolonising states of Africa, Asia, and Oceania.

Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, this phase of the Cold War saw the Sino-Soviet split. Between China and the Soviet Union&#x27;s complicated relations within the Communist sphere, leading to the Sino-Soviet border conflict, while France, a Western Bloc state, began to demand greater autonomy of action. The Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia occurred to suppress the Prague Spring of 1968, while the United States experienced internal turmoil from the civil rights movement and opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War. In the 1960s–1970s, an international peace movement took root among citizens around the world. Movements against nuclear weapons testing and for nuclear disarmament took place, with large anti-war protests. By the 1970s, both sides had started making allowances for peace and security, ushering in a period of détente that saw the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the 1972 visit by Richard Nixon to China that opened relations with China as a strategic counterweight to the Soviet Union. A number of self-proclaimed Marxist–Leninist governments were formed in the second half of the 1970s in developing countries, including Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Afghanistan, and Nicaragua.

Détente collapsed at the end of the decade with the beginning of the Soviet–Afghan War in 1979. Beginning in the 1980s, this phase was another period of elevated tension. The Reagan Doctrine led to increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressures on the Soviet Union, which at the time was undergoing the Era of Stagnation. This phase saw the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introducing the liberalizing reforms of &quot;glasnost&quot; (&quot;openness&quot;) and &quot;perestroika&quot; (&quot;reorganization&quot;) and ending Soviet involvement in Afghanistan in 1989. Pressures for national sovereignty grew stronger in Eastern Europe, and Gorbachev refused to further support the Communist governments militarily.

The fall of the Iron Curtain after the Pan-European Picnic and the Revolutions of 1989, which represented a peaceful revolutionary wave with the exception of the Romanian revolution and the Afghan Civil War (1989–1992), overthrew almost all of the Marxist–Leninist regimes of the Eastern Bloc. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union itself lost control in the country and was banned following the 1991 Soviet coup attempt that August. This in turn led to the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991 and the collapse of Communist governments across much of Africa and Asia. The Russian Federation became the Soviet Union&#x27;s successor state, while many of the other republics emerged as fully independent post-Soviet states. The United States was left as the world&#x27;s sole superpower.

==Containment, Truman Doctrine, Korean War (1947–1953)==
===Iron Curtain, Iran, Turkey, Greece, and Poland===

In February 1946, George F. Kennan&#x27;s &quot;Long Telegram&quot; from Moscow to Washington helped to articulate the US government&#x27;s increasingly hard line against the Soviets, which would become the basis for US strategy toward the Soviet Union. The telegram galvanized a policy debate that would eventually shape the Truman administration&#x27;s Soviet policy. Washington&#x27;s opposition to the Soviets accumulated after broken promises by Stalin and Molotov concerning Europe and Iran. Following the World War II Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, the country was occupied by the Red Army in the far north and the British in the south. Iran was used by the United States and British to supply the Soviet Union, and the Allies agreed to withdraw from Iran within six months after the cessation of hostilities. However, when this deadline came, the Soviets remained in Iran under the guise of the Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government and Kurdish Republic of Mahabad. On 5 March, former British prime minister Winston Churchill delivered his famous &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; speech calling for an Anglo-American alliance against the Soviets, whom he accused of establishing an &quot;iron curtain&quot; dividing Europe.

A week later, on 13 March, Stalin responded vigorously to the speech, saying Churchill could be compared to Adolf Hitler insofar as he advocated the racial superiority of English-speaking nations so that they could satisfy their hunger for world domination, and that such a declaration was &quot;a call for war on the USSR.&quot; The Soviet leader also dismissed the accusation that the USSR was exerting increasing control over the countries lying in its sphere. He argued that there was nothing surprising in &quot;the fact that the Soviet Union, anxious for its future safety, [was] trying to see to it that governments loyal in their attitude to the Soviet Union should exist in these countries.&quot;
Soviet territorial demands to Turkey regarding the Dardanelles in the Turkish Straits crisis and Black Sea border disputes were also a major factor in increasing tensions. In September, the Soviet side produced the Novikov telegram, sent by the Soviet ambassador to the US but commissioned and &quot;co-authored&quot; by Vyacheslav Molotov; it portrayed the US as being in the grip of monopoly capitalists who were building up military capability &quot;to prepare the conditions for winning world supremacy in a new war&quot;. On 6 September 1946, James F. Byrnes delivered a speech in Germany repudiating the Morgenthau Plan (a proposal to partition and de-industrialize post-war Germany) and warning the Soviets that the US intended to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely. As Byrnes stated a month later, &quot;The nub of our program was to win the German people ... it was a battle between us and Russia over minds ...&quot; In December, the Soviets agreed to withdraw from Iran after persistent US pressure, an early success of containment policy.

By 1947, US president Harry S. Truman was outraged by the perceived resistance of the Soviet Union to American demands in Iran, Turkey, and Greece, as well as Soviet rejection of the Baruch Plan on nuclear weapons. In February 1947, the British government announced that it could no longer afford to finance the Kingdom of Greece in its civil war against Communist-led insurgents. In the same month, Stalin conducted the rigged 1947 Polish legislative election which constituted an open breach of the Yalta Agreement. The US government responded by adopting a policy of containment, with the goal of stopping the spread of communism. Truman delivered a speech calling for the allocation of $400 million to intervene in the war and unveiled the Truman Doctrine, which framed the conflict as a contest between free peoples and totalitarian regimes. American policymakers accused the Soviet Union of conspiring against the Greek royalists in an effort to expand Soviet influence even though Stalin had told the Communist Party to cooperate with the British-backed government.

Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine marked the beginning of a US bipartisan defense and foreign policy consensus between Republicans and Democrats focused on containment and deterrence that weakened during and after the Vietnam War, but ultimately persisted thereafter. Moderate and conservative parties in Europe, as well as social democrats, gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance, while European and American Communists, financed by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations, adhered to Moscow&#x27;s line, although dissent began to appear after 1956. Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the anti-nuclear movement.

===Marshall Plan, Czechoslovak coup and formation of two German states===

In early 1947, France, Britain and the United States unsuccessfully attempted to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already taken by the Soviets. In June 1947, in accordance with the Truman Doctrine, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan, a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate. Under the plan, which President Harry S. Truman signed on 3 April 1948, the US government gave to Western European countries over $13 billion (equivalent to $189 billion in 2016). Later, the program led to the creation of the OECD.

The plan&#x27;s aim was to rebuild the democratic and economic systems of Europe and to counter perceived threats to the European balance of power, such as communist parties seizing control. The plan also stated that European prosperity was contingent upon German economic recovery. One month later, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, creating a unified Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Security Council (NSC). These would become the main bureaucracies for US defense policy in the Cold War.

Stalin believed economic integration with the West would allow Eastern Bloc countries to escape Soviet control, and that the US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe. Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid. The Soviet Union&#x27;s alternative to the Marshall Plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, became known as the Molotov Plan (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance). Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; his vision of a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union.

In early 1948, Czech Communists executed a coup d&#x27;état in Czechoslovakia (resulting in the formation of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic), the only Eastern Bloc state that the Soviets had permitted to retain democratic structures. The public brutality of the coup shocked Western powers more than any event up to that point and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress.

In an immediate aftermath of the crisis, the London Six-Power Conference was held, resulting in the Soviet boycott of the Allied Control Council and its incapacitation, an event marking the beginning of the full-blown Cold War, as well as ending any hopes at the time for a single German government and leading to formation in 1949 of the Federal Republic of Germany and German Democratic Republic.

The twin policies of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan led to billions in economic and military aid for Western Europe, Greece, and Turkey. With the US assistance, the Greek military won its civil war. Under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi the Italian Christian Democrats defeated the powerful Communist–Socialist alliance in the elections of 1948.

Outside of Europe, the United States also began to express interest in the development of many other countries, so that they would not fall under the sway of Eastern Bloc communism. In his January 1949 inaugural address, Truman declared for the first time in U.S. history that international development would be a key part of U.S. foreign policy. The resulting program later became known as the Point Four Program because it was the fourth point raised in his address.

===Espionage===
All major powers engaged in espionage, using a great variety of spies, double agents, moles, and new technologies such as the tapping of telephone cables. The Soviet KGB (&quot;Committee for State Security&quot;), the bureau responsible for foreign espionage and internal surveillance, was famous for its effectiveness. The most famous Soviet operation involved its atomic spies that delivered crucial information from the United States&#x27; Manhattan Project, leading the USSR to detonate its first nuclear weapon in 1949, four years after the American detonation and much sooner than expected. A massive network of informants throughout the Soviet Union was used to monitor dissent from official Soviet politics and morals. Although to an extent disinformation had always existed, the term itself was invented, and the strategy formalized by a black propaganda department of the Soviet KGB.

Based on the amount of top-secret Cold War archival information that has been released, historian Raymond L. Garthoff concludes there probably was parity in the quantity and quality of secret information obtained by each side. However, the Soviets probably had an advantage in terms of HUMINT (human intelligence or interpersonal espionage) and &quot;sometimes in its reach into high policy circles.&quot; In terms of decisive impact, however, he concludes:
We also can now have high confidence in the judgment that there were no successful &quot;moles&quot; at the political decision-making level on either side. Similarly, there is no evidence, on either side, of any major political or military decision that was prematurely discovered through espionage and thwarted by the other side. There also is no evidence of any major political or military decision that was crucially influenced (much less generated) by an agent of the other side.

According to historian Robert L. Benson, &quot;Washington&#x27;s forte was &#x27;signals&#x27; intelligencethe procurement and analysis of coded foreign messages,&quot; leading to the Venona project or Venona intercepts, which monitored the communications of Soviet intelligence agents. Moynihan wrote that the Venona project contained &quot;overwhelming proof of the activities of Soviet spy networks in America, complete with names, dates, places, and deeds.&quot; The Venona project was kept highly secret even from policymakers until the Moynihan Commission in 1995. Despite this, the decryption project had already been betrayed and dispatched to the USSR by Kim Philby and Bill Weisband in 1946, as was discovered by the US by 1950. Nonetheless, the Soviets had to keep their discovery of the program secret, too, and continued leaking their own information, some of which was still useful to the American program. According to Moynihan, even President Truman may not have been fully informed of Venona, which may have left him unaware of the extent of Soviet espionage.

Clandestine atomic spies from the Soviet Union, who infiltrated the Manhattan Project during WWII, played a major role in increasing tensions that led to the Cold War.

In addition to usual espionage, the Western agencies paid special attention to debriefing Eastern Bloc defectors. Edward Jay Epstein describes that the CIA understood that the KGB used &quot;provocations&quot;, or fake defections, as a trick to embarrass Western intelligence and establish Soviet double agents. As a result, from 1959 to 1973, the CIA required that East Bloc defectors went through a counterintelligence investigation before being recruited as a source of intelligence.

During the late 1970s and 1980s, the KGB perfected its use of espionage to sway and distort diplomacy. Active measures were &quot;clandestine operations designed to further Soviet foreign policy goals,&quot; consisting of disinformation, forgeries, leaks to foreign media, and the channeling of aid to militant groups. Retired KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin described active measures as &quot;the heart and soul of Soviet intelligence.&quot;

During the Sino-Soviet split, &quot;spy wars&quot; also occurred between the USSR and PRC.

===Cominform and the Tito–Stalin Split===
In September 1947, the Soviets created Cominform to impose orthodoxy within the international communist movement and tighten political control over Soviet satellites through coordination of communist parties in the Eastern Bloc. Cominform faced an embarrassing setback the following June, when the Tito–Stalin split obliged its members to expel Yugoslavia, which remained communist but adopted a non-aligned position and began accepting financial aid from the US.

Besides Berlin, the status of the city of Trieste was at issue. Until the break between Tito and Stalin, the Western powers and the Eastern bloc faced each other uncompromisingly. In addition to capitalism and communism, Italians and Slovenes, monarchists and republicans as well as war winners and losers often faced each other irreconcilably. The neutral buffer state Free Territory of Trieste, founded in 1947 with the United Nations, was split up and dissolved in 1954 and 1975, also because of the détente between the West and Tito.

===Berlin Blockade===

The US and Britain merged their western German occupation zones into &quot;Bizone&quot; (1 January 1947, later &quot;Trizone&quot; with the addition of France&#x27;s zone, April 1949). As part of the economic rebuilding of Germany, in early 1948, representatives of a number of Western European governments and the United States announced an agreement for a merger of western German areas into a federal governmental system. In addition, in accordance with the Marshall Plan, they began to re-industrialize and rebuild the West German economy, including the introduction of a new Deutsche Mark currency to replace the old Reichsmark currency that the Soviets had debased. The US had secretly decided that a unified and neutral Germany was undesirable, with Walter Bedell Smith telling General Eisenhower &quot;in spite of our announced position, we really do not want nor intend to accept German unification on any terms that the Russians might agree to, even though they seem to meet most of our requirements.&quot;

Shortly thereafter, Stalin instituted the Berlin Blockade (June 1948 – May 1949), one of the first major crises of the Cold War, preventing Western supplies from reaching West Germany&#x27;s exclave of West Berlin. The United States (primarily), Britain, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and several other countries began the massive &quot;Berlin airlift&quot;, supplying West Berlin with provisions despite Soviet threats.

The Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the policy change. Once again, the East Berlin communists attempted to disrupt the Berlin municipal elections, which were held on 5 December 1948 and produced a turnout of 86% and an overwhelming victory for the non-communist parties. The results effectively divided the city into East and West, the latter comprising US, British and French sectors. 300,000 Berliners demonstrated and urged the international airlift to continue, and US Air Force pilot Gail Halvorsen created &quot;Operation Vittles&quot;, which supplied candy to German children. The Airlift was as much a logistical as a political and psychological success for the West; it firmly linked West Berlin to the United States. In May 1949, Stalin lifted the blockade.

In 1952, Stalin repeatedly proposed a plan to unify East and West Germany under a single government chosen in elections supervised by the United Nations, if the new Germany were to stay out of Western military alliances, but this proposal was turned down by the Western powers. Some sources dispute the sincerity of the proposal.

===Beginnings of NATO and Radio Free Europe===

Britain, France, the United States, Canada and eight other western European countries signed the North Atlantic Treaty of April 1949, establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). That August, the first Soviet atomic device was detonated in Semipalatinsk, Kazakh SSR. Following Soviet refusals to participate in a German rebuilding effort set forth by western European countries in 1948, the US, Britain and France spearheaded the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany from the three Western zones of occupation in April 1949. The Soviet Union proclaimed its zone of occupation in Germany the German Democratic Republic that October.

Media in the Eastern Bloc was an organ of the state, completely reliant on and subservient to the communist party. Radio and television organizations were state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local communist party. Soviet radio broadcasts used Marxist rhetoric to attack capitalism, emphasizing themes of labor exploitation, imperialism and war-mongering.

Along with the broadcasts of the BBC and the Voice of America to Central and Eastern Europe, a major propaganda effort began in 1949 was Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, dedicated to bringing about the peaceful demise of the communist system in the Eastern Bloc. Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, an alternative to the controlled and party-dominated domestic press in the Soviet Bloc. Radio Free Europe was a product of some of the most prominent architects of America&#x27;s early Cold War strategy, especially those who believed that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means, such as George F. Kennan. Soviet and Eastern Bloc authorities used various methods to suppress Western broadcasts, including radio jamming.

American policymakers, including Kennan and John Foster Dulles, acknowledged that the Cold War was in its essence a war of ideas. The United States, acting through the CIA, funded a long list of projects to counter the communist appeal among intellectuals in Europe and the developing world. The CIA also covertly sponsored a domestic propaganda campaign called Crusade for Freedom.

===German rearmament===


The rearmament of West Germany was achieved in the early 1950s. Its main promoter was Konrad Adenauer, the chancellor of West Germany, with France the main opponent. Washington had the decisive voice. It was strongly supported by the Pentagon (the US military leadership), and weakly opposed by President Truman; the State Department was ambivalent. The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 changed the calculations and Washington now gave full support. That also involved naming Dwight D. Eisenhower in charge of NATO forces and sending more American troops to West Germany. There was a strong promise that West Germany would not develop nuclear weapons.

Widespread fears of another rise of German militarism necessitated the new military to operate within an alliance framework under NATO command. In 1955, Washington secured full German membership of NATO. In May 1953, Lavrentiy Beria, by then in a government post, had made an unsuccessful proposal to allow the reunification of a neutral Germany to prevent West Germany&#x27;s incorporation into NATO, but his attempts were cut short after he was executed several months later during a Soviet power struggle. The events led to the establishment of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;, the West German military, in 1955.

===Chinese Civil War, SEATO, and NSC 68===

In 1949, Mao Zedong&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army defeated Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s United States-backed Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Government in China. The KMT-controlled territory was now restricted to the island of Taiwan, the nationalist government of which exists to this day. The Kremlin promptly created an alliance with the newly formed People&#x27;s Republic of China. According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Moreover, his party was weakened during the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and they cloaked themselves under the cover of Chinese nationalism.

Confronted with the communist revolution in China and the end of the American atomic monopoly in 1949, the Truman administration quickly moved to escalate and expand its containment doctrine. In NSC 68, a secret 1950 document, the National Security Council proposed reinforcing pro-Western alliance systems and quadrupling spending on defense. Truman, under the influence of advisor Paul Nitze, saw containment as implying complete rollback of Soviet influence in all its forms.

United States officials moved to expand this version of containment into Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in order to counter revolutionary nationalist movements, often led by communist parties financed by the USSR. In this way, this US would exercise &quot;preponderant power,&quot; oppose neutrality, and establish global hegemony. In the early 1950s (a period sometimes known as the &quot;Pactomania&quot;), the US formalized a series of alliances with Japan (a former WWII enemy), South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines (notably ANZUS in 1951 and SEATO in 1954), thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of long-term military bases.

===Korean War===

One of the more significant examples of the implementation of containment was the United Nations US-led intervention in the Korean War. In June 1950, after years of mutual hostilities, Kim Il Sung&#x27;s North Korean People&#x27;s Army invaded South Korea. Stalin had been reluctant to support the invasion but ultimately sent advisers. To Stalin&#x27;s surprise, the United Nations Security Council backed the defense of South Korea, although the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest of the fact that Taiwan (Republic of China), not the People&#x27;s Republic of China, held a permanent seat on the council. A UN force of sixteen countries faced North Korea, although 40 percent of troops were South Korean, and about 50 percent were from the United States.
The US initially seemed to follow containment, only pushing back North Korea across the 38th Parallel and restoring South Korea&#x27;s sovereignty while allowing North Korea&#x27;s survival as a state. However, the success of the Inchon landing inspired the US/UN forces to pursue a rollback strategy instead and to overthrow communist North Korea, thereby allowing nationwide elections under U.N. auspices. General Douglas MacArthur then advanced into North Korea. The Chinese, fearful of a possible US invasion, sent in a large army and pushed the U.N. forces back below the 38th parallel. The episode was used to support the wisdom of the containment doctrine as opposed to rollback. The Communists were later pushed to roughly around the original border, with minimal changes. Among other effects, the Korean War galvanised NATO to develop a military structure. The Korean Armistice Agreement was approved in July 1953.

==Nuclear Arms Race and escalation (1953–1962)==
===Khrushchev, Eisenhower, and de-Stalinization===
In 1953, changes in political leadership on both sides shifted the dynamic of the Cold War. Dwight D. Eisenhower was inaugurated president that January. During the last 18 months of the Truman administration, the American defense budget had quadrupled, and Eisenhower moved to reduce military spending by a third while continuing to fight the Cold War effectively.

Joseph Stalin died in 1953. Nikita Khrushchev eventually won the ensuing power struggle by the mid-1950s. In 1956, he denounced Joseph Stalin and proceeded to ease controls over the party and society (de-Stalinization).
On 18 November 1956, while addressing Western dignitaries at a reception in Moscow&#x27;s Polish embassy, Khrushchev infamously declared, &quot;Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you&quot;, shocking everyone present. He would later claim he had not been referring to nuclear war, but the &quot;historically fated victory of communism over capitalism.&quot;

Eisenhower&#x27;s secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, initiated a &quot;New Look&quot; for the containment strategy, calling for a greater reliance on nuclear weapons against US enemies in wartime. Dulles also enunciated the doctrine of &quot;massive retaliation&quot;, threatening a severe US response to any Soviet aggression. Possessing nuclear superiority, for example, allowed Eisenhower to face down Soviet threats to intervene in the Middle East during the 1956 Suez Crisis. The declassified US plans for retaliatory nuclear strikes in the late 1950s included the &quot;systematic destruction&quot; of 1,200 major urban centers in the Soviet Bloc and China, including Moscow, East Berlin and Beijing.

In spite of these events, there were substantial hopes for détente when an upswing in diplomacy took place in 1959, including a two-week visit by Khrushchev to the US, and plans for a two-power summit for May 1960. The latter was disturbed by the U-2 spy plane scandal, however, in which Eisenhower was caught lying about the intrusion of American surveillance aircraft into Soviet territory.

===Warsaw Pact and Hungarian Revolution===


While Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 slightly relaxed tensions, the situation in Europe remained an uneasy armed truce. The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the Eastern Bloc by 1949, established a formal alliance therein, the Warsaw Pact, in 1955. It stood opposed to NATO.
The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 occurred shortly after Khrushchev arranged the removal of Hungary&#x27;s Stalinist leader Mátyás Rákosi. In response to a popular anti-communist uprising, the new regime formally disbanded the secret police, declared its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and pledged to re-establish free elections. The Soviet Army invaded. Thousands of Hungarians were killed and arrested, imprisoned and deported to the Soviet Union, and approximately 200,000 Hungarians fled Hungary. Hungarian leader Imre Nagy and others were executed following secret trials.

From 1957 through 1961, Khrushchev openly and repeatedly threatened the West with nuclear annihilation. He claimed that Soviet missile capabilities were far superior to those of the United States, capable of wiping out any American or European city. According to John Lewis Gaddis, Khrushchev rejected Stalin&#x27;s &quot;belief in the inevitability of war,&quot; however. The new leader declared his ultimate goal was &quot;peaceful coexistence&quot;. In Khrushchev&#x27;s formulation, peace would allow capitalism to collapse on its own, as well as giving the Soviets time to boost their military capabilities, which remained for decades until Gorbachev&#x27;s later &quot;new thinking&quot; envisioning peaceful coexistence as an end in itself rather than a form of class struggle.

The events in Hungary produced ideological fractures within the communist parties of the world, particularly in Western Europe, with great decline in membership, as many in both western and socialist countries felt disillusioned by the brutal Soviet response. The communist parties in the West would never recover.

===Rapacki Plan and Berlin Crisis of 1958–1959===
In 1957, Polish foreign minister Adam Rapacki proposed the Rapacki Plan for a nuclear free zone in central Europe. Public opinion tended to be favourable in the West, but it was rejected by leaders of West Germany, Britain, France and the United States. They feared it would leave the powerful conventional armies of the Warsaw Pact dominant over the weaker NATO armies.

During November 1958, Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of Berlin into an independent, demilitarized &quot;free city&quot;. He gave the United States, Great Britain and France a six-month ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors of West Berlin, or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the East Germans. Khrushchev earlier explained to Mao Zedong that &quot;Berlin is the testicles of the West. Every time I want to make the West scream, I squeeze on Berlin.&quot; NATO formally rejected the ultimatum in mid-December and Khrushchev withdrew it in return for a Geneva conference on the German question.

===American military buildup===
Like Truman and Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy supported containment. President Eisenhower&#x27;s New Look policy had emphasized the use of less expensive nuclear weapons to deter Soviet aggression by threatening massive nuclear attacks on all of the Soviet Union. Nuclear weapons were much cheaper than maintaining a large standing army, so Eisenhower cut conventional forces to save money. Kennedy implemented a new strategy known as flexible response. This strategy relied on conventional arms to achieve limited goals. As part of this policy, Kennedy expanded the United States special operations forces, elite military units that could fight unconventionally in various conflicts. Kennedy hoped that the flexible response strategy would allow the US to counter Soviet influence without resorting to nuclear war.

To support his new strategy, Kennedy ordered a massive increase in defense spending and a rapid build-up of the nuclear arsenal to restore the lost superiority over the Soviet Union. In his inaugural address, Kennedy promised &quot;to bear any burden&quot; in the defense of liberty, and he repeatedly asked for increases in military spending and authorization of new weapons systems. From 1961 to 1964, the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them. The new ICBM force grew from 63 intercontinental ballistic missiles to 424. He authorized 23 new Polaris submarines, each of which carried 16 nuclear missiles. Kennedy also called on cities to construct fallout shelters.

===Competition in the Third World===

Nationalist movements in some countries and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia and Indochina, were often allied with communist groups or otherwise perceived to be unfriendly to Western interests. In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s. Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence. The Kremlin saw continuing territorial losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology.

The United States used the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to undermine neutral or hostile Third World governments and to support allied ones. In 1953, President Eisenhower implemented Operation Ajax, a covert coup operation to overthrow the Iranian prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh. The popularly elected Mosaddegh had been a Middle Eastern nemesis of Britain since nationalizing the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951. Winston Churchill told the United States that Mosaddegh was &quot;increasingly turning towards Communist influence.&quot; The pro-Western shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, assumed control as an autocratic monarch. The shah&#x27;s policies included banning the communist Tudeh Party of Iran, and general suppression of political dissent by SAVAK, the shah&#x27;s domestic security and intelligence agency.

In Guatemala, a banana republic, the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état ousted the left-wing President Jacobo Árbenz with material CIA support. The post-Arbenz government—a military junta headed by Carlos Castillo Armas—repealed a progressive land reform law, returned nationalized property belonging to the United Fruit Company, set up a National Committee of Defense Against Communism, and decreed a Preventive Penal Law Against Communism at the request of the United States.

The non-aligned Indonesian government of Sukarno was faced with a major threat to its legitimacy beginning in 1956 when several regional commanders began to demand autonomy from Jakarta. After mediation failed, Sukarno took action to remove the dissident commanders. In February 1958, dissident military commanders in Central Sumatra (Colonel Ahmad Husein) and North Sulawesi (Colonel Ventje Sumual) declared the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia-Permesta Movement aimed at overthrowing the Sukarno regime. They were joined by many civilian politicians from the Masyumi Party, such as Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, who were opposed to the growing influence of the communist Partai Komunis Indonesia. Due to their anti-communist rhetoric, the rebels received arms, funding, and other covert aid from the CIA until Allen Lawrence Pope, an American pilot, was shot down after a bombing raid on government-held Ambon in April 1958. The central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions of rebel strongholds at Padang and Manado. By the end of 1958, the rebels were militarily defeated, and the last remaining rebel guerilla bands surrendered by August 1961.
In the Republic of the Congo, also known as Congo-Léopoldville, newly independent from Belgium since June 1960, the Congo Crisis erupted on 5 July leading to the secession of the regions Katanga and South Kasai. CIA-backed President Joseph Kasa-Vubu ordered the dismissal of the democratically elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and the Lumumba cabinet in September over massacres by the armed forces during the invasion of South Kasai and for involving Soviets in the country. Later the CIA-backed Colonel Mobutu Sese Seko quickly mobilized his forces to seize power through a military coup d&#x27;état, and worked with Western intelligence agencies to imprison Lumumba and hand him over to Katangan authorities who executed him by firing squad.

In British Guiana, the leftist People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP) candidate Cheddi Jagan won the position of chief minister in a colonially administered election in 1953 but was quickly forced to resign from power after Britain&#x27;s suspension of the still-dependent nation&#x27;s constitution. Embarrassed by the landslide electoral victory of Jagan&#x27;s allegedly Marxist party, the British imprisoned the PPP&#x27;s leadership and maneuvered the organization into a divisive rupture in 1955. Jagan again won the colonial elections in 1957 and 1961, despite Britain&#x27;s shift to a reconsideration of its view of the left-wing Jagan as a Soviet-style communist at this time. The United States pressured the British to withhold Guyana&#x27;s independence until an alternative to Jagan could be identified, supported, and brought into office. In Malaya, the British colonialists suppressed the communist anti-colonial rebellion.

Worn down by the communist guerrilla war for Vietnamese full independence and handed a watershed defeat by communist Viet Minh rebels at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, the French accepted a negotiated abandonment of their neo-colonial stake in Vietnam right in 1954. On June 4, France granted full sovereignty to the anti-communist State of Vietnam, an independent country within the French Union. In the Geneva Conference in July, peace accords were signed, leaving Vietnam divided between a pro-Soviet administration in North Vietnam and a pro-Western administration in South Vietnam at the 17th parallel north. Between 1954 and 1961, Eisenhower&#x27;s United States sent economic aid and military advisers to strengthen South Vietnam&#x27;s pro-Western government against communist efforts to destabilize it. 

Many emerging nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America rejected the pressure to choose sides in the East–West competition. In 1955, at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia, dozens of Third World governments resolved to stay out of the Cold War. The consensus reached at Bandung culminated with the creation of the Belgrade-headquartered Non-Aligned Movement in 1961. Meanwhile, Khrushchev broadened Moscow&#x27;s policy to establish ties with India and other key neutral states. Independence movements in the Third World transformed the post-war order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America.

===Sino-Soviet split===

After 1956, the Sino-Soviet alliance began to break down. Mao had defended Stalin when Khrushchev criticized him in 1956 and treated the new Soviet leader as a superficial upstart, accusing him of having lost his revolutionary edge. For his part, Khrushchev, disturbed by Mao&#x27;s glib attitude toward nuclear war, referred to the Chinese leader as a &quot;lunatic on a throne&quot;.

After this, Khrushchev made many desperate attempts to reconstitute the Sino-Soviet alliance, but Mao considered it useless and denied any proposal. The Chinese-Soviet animosity spilled out in an intra-communist propaganda war. Further on, the Soviets focused on a bitter rivalry with Mao&#x27;s China for leadership of the global communist movement. Historian Lorenz M. Lüthi argues:
:The Sino-Soviet split was one of the key events of the Cold War, equal in importance to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Second Vietnam War, and Sino-American rapprochement. The split helped to determine the framework for the Cold War period 1979–1985 in general, and influenced the course of the Second Vietnam War in particular.

===Space Race===
On the nuclear weapons front, the United States and the Soviet Union pursued nuclear rearmament and developed long-range weapons with which they could strike the territory of the other. In August 1957, the Soviets successfully launched the world&#x27;s first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), and in October they launched the first Earth satellite, Sputnik 1. This led to what became known as the Sputnik crisis. The Central Intelligence Agency described the orbit of Sputnik 1 as a &quot;stupendous scientific achievement&quot; and concluded that the USSR had likely perfected an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching &#x27;any desired target with accuracy&#x27;. 

The launch of Sputnik inaugurated the Space Race. This led to a series of historic space exploration milestones, and most notably the Apollo Moon landings from 1969 by the United States, which astronaut Frank Borman later described as &quot;just a battle in the Cold War.&quot; The public&#x27;s reaction in the Soviet Union was mixed. The Soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing, which affected the reaction. A portion of the populace did not give it any attention, and another portion was angered by it. A major Cold War element of the Space Race was satellite reconnaissance, as well as signals intelligence to gauge which aspects of the space programs had military capabilities. The Soviet Salyut programme, conducted in the 1970s and 80s, put a manned space station in long term orbit; two of the successful installations to the station were covers for secret military Almaz reconnaissance stations: Salyut 3, and Salyut 5.

During the whole duration of the cold war, the US and the USSR represented the largest and dominant space powers of the world. Despite their fierce competition, both nations signed international space treaties in the 1960s which would limit the militarization of space.

The first research of anti-satellite weapon technology also came about during this period.

Later, the US and USSR pursued some cooperation in space as part of détente, notably the Apollo–Soyuz orbital rendezvous and docking.

===Aftermath of the Cuban Revolution===

In Cuba, the 26th of July Movement, led by young revolutionaries Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, seized power in the Cuban Revolution on 1 January 1959. Although Fidel Castro&#x27;s first refused to categorize his new government as socialist and repeatedly denying being a communist, Castro appointed Marxists to senior government and military positions.

Diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States continued for some time after Batista&#x27;s fall, but President Eisenhower deliberately left the capital to avoid meeting Castro during the latter&#x27;s trip to Washington, D.C. in April, leaving Vice President Richard Nixon to conduct the meeting in his place. Cuba began negotiating for arms purchases from the Eastern Bloc in March 1960. The same month, Eisenhower gave approval to CIA plans and funding to overthrow Castro.

In January 1961, just prior to leaving office, Eisenhower formally severed relations with the Cuban government. That April, the administration of newly elected American President John F. Kennedy mounted the unsuccessful CIA-organized ship-borne invasion of the island by Cuban exiles at Playa Girón and Playa Larga in Santa Clara Province—a failure that publicly humiliated the United States. Castro responded by publicly embracing Marxism–Leninism, and the Soviet Union pledged to provide further support. In December, the US government began a violent campaign of terrorist attacks against civilians in Cuba, and covert operations and sabotage against the administration, in an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government.

===Berlin Crisis of 1961===


The Berlin Crisis of 1961 was the last major incident in the Cold War regarding the status of Berlin and post–World War II Germany. By the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to restricting emigration movement was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc. However, hundreds of thousands of East Germans annually emigrated to free and prosperous West Germany through a &quot;loophole&quot; in the system that existed between East Berlin and West Berlin.

The emigration resulted in a massive &quot;brain drain&quot; from East Germany to West Germany of younger educated professionals, such that nearly 20% of East Germany&#x27;s population had migrated to West Germany by 1961. That June, the Soviet Union issued a new ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of Allied forces from West Berlin. The request was rebuffed, but the United States now limited its security guarantees to West Berlin. On 13 August, East Germany erected a barbed-wire barrier that would eventually be expanded through construction into the Berlin Wall, effectively closing the loophole and preventing its citizens from fleeing to the West.

===Cuban Missile Crisis and Khrushchev&#x27;s ousting===

The Kennedy administration continued seeking ways to oust Castro following the Bay of Pigs invasion, experimenting with various ways of covertly facilitating the overthrow of the Cuban government. Significant hopes were pinned on the program of terrorist attacks and other destabilization operations known as Operation Mongoose, that was devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961. Khrushchev learned of the project in February 1962, and preparations to install Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba were undertaken in response.

Alarmed, Kennedy considered various reactions. He ultimately responded to the installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba with a naval blockade, and he presented an ultimatum to the Soviets. Khrushchev backed down from a confrontation, and the Soviet Union removed the missiles in return for a public American pledge not to invade Cuba again as well as a covert deal to remove US missiles from Turkey.

The Cuban Missile Crisis (October–November 1962) brought the world closer to nuclear war than ever before. The aftermath led to efforts in the nuclear arms race at nuclear disarmament and improving relations, although the Cold War&#x27;s first arms control agreement, the Antarctic Treaty, had come into force in 1961.

The compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev, and the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started. In 1964, Khrushchev&#x27;s Kremlin colleagues managed to oust him, but allowed him a peaceful retirement. He was accused of rudeness and incompetence, and John Lewis Gaddis argues that he was also blamed with ruining Soviet agriculture, bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war, and becoming an &quot;international embarrassment&quot; when he authorized construction of the Berlin Wall. According to Dobrynin, the top Soviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as &quot;a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation&quot;.

==From confrontation to détente (1962–1979)==


In the course of the 1960s and 1970s, Cold War participants struggled to adjust to a new, more complicated pattern of international relations in which the world was no longer divided into two clearly opposed blocs. From the beginning of the post-war period, with American help Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s, with per capita GDPs approaching those of the United States, while Eastern Bloc economies stagnated.

The Vietnam War descended into a quagmire for the United States, leading to a decline in international prestige and economic stability, derailing arms agreements, and provoking domestic unrest. America&#x27;s withdrawal from the war led it to embrace a policy of détente with both China and the Soviet Union.

In the 1973 oil crisis, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut their petroleum output. This raised oil prices and hurt Western economies, but helped the Soviet Union by generating a huge flow of money from its oil sales.

As a result of the oil crisis, combined with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as OPEC and the Non-Aligned Movement, less powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower. Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union&#x27;s deep-seated domestic economic problems. During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente.

===Vietnam War===

Under President John F. Kennedy, US troop levels in Vietnam grew from just under a thousand in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963. South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem&#x27;s heavy-handed crackdown on Buddhist monks in 1963 led the US to endorse a deadly military coup against Diem. The war escalated further in 1964 following the controversial Gulf of Tonkin incident, in which a US destroyer was alleged to have clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution gave President Lyndon B. Johnson broad authorization to increase US military presence, deploying ground combat units for the first time and increasing troop levels to 184,000. Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev responded by reversing Khrushchev&#x27;s policy of disengagement and increasing aid to the North Vietnamese, hoping to entice the North from its pro-Chinese position. The USSR discouraged further escalation of the war, however, providing just enough military assistance to tie up American forces. From this point, the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) engaged in more conventional warfare with US and South Vietnamese forces.

The Tet Offensive of 1968 proved to be the turning point of the war. Despite years of American tutelage and aid, the South Vietnamese forces were unable to withstand the communist offensive and the task fell to US forces instead. At the same time, in 1963–1965, American domestic politics saw the triumph of liberalism. According to historian Joseph Crespino:
:It has become a staple of twentieth-century historiography that Cold War concerns were at the root of a number of progressive political accomplishments in the postwar period: a high progressive marginal tax rate that helped fund the arms race and contributed to broad income equality; bipartisan support for far-reaching civil rights legislation that transformed politics and society in the American South, which had long given the lie to America&#x27;s egalitarian ethos; bipartisan support for overturning an explicitly racist immigration system that had been in place since the 1920s; and free health care for the elderly and the poor, a partial fulfillment of one of the unaccomplished goals of the New Deal era. The list could go on.

=== Nuclear testing and Use of Outer-Space treaties ===
The Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed on August 5, 1963, by the United States, the Soviet Union, and over 100 other nations. This treaty banned nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, outer space, and underwater, restricting such tests to underground environments. The treaty followed heightened concerns over the militarization of space, amplified by the United States&#x27; Starfish Prime test in 1962, which involved the detonation of a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere.

To further delineate the peaceful use of outer space, the United Nations facilitated the drafting of the &quot;Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies&quot;, commonly known as the Outer Space Treaty. Signed on January 27, 1967, by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, it entered into force on October 10, 1967. The treaty established space as a domain to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes, prohibiting the placement of nuclear weapons or any other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on celestial bodies.

===Invasion of Czechoslovakia===

In 1968, a period of political liberalization took place in Czechoslovakia called the Prague Spring. An &quot;Action Program&quot; of reforms included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of movement, along with an economic emphasis on consumer goods, the possibility of a multiparty government, limitations on the power of the secret police, and potential withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact.

In answer to the Prague Spring, on 20 August 1968, the Soviet Army, together with most of their Warsaw Pact allies, invaded Czechoslovakia. The invasion was followed by a wave of emigration, including an estimated 70,000 Czechs and Slovaks initially fleeing, with the total eventually reaching 300,000. The invasion sparked intense protests from Yugoslavia, Romania, China, and from Western European countries.

===Sino-Soviet split and Nixon-China visit===
As a result of the Sino-Soviet split, tensions along the Chinese–Soviet border reached their peak in 1969, when the Soviet planned to launch a large-scale nuclear strike against China. United States President Richard Nixon intervened, and decided to use the conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War through a policy of rapproachment with China, which began with his 1972 visit to China and culminated in 1979 with the signing of the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations by President Carter and Chinese Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping.

===Nixon, Brezhnev, and détente===

Although indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s, tensions were beginning to ease. Following the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of collective leadership ensued, consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as general secretary, Alexei Kosygin as Premier and Nikolai Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader.

Following his visit to China, Nixon met with Soviet leaders in Moscow. These Strategic Arms Limitation Talks resulted in landmark arms control treaties. These aimed to limit the development of costly anti-ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles.

Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of &quot;peaceful coexistence&quot; and established the groundbreaking new policy of détente (or cooperation) between the superpowers. Meanwhile, Brezhnev attempted to revive the Soviet economy, which was declining in part because of heavy military expenditures. The Soviet Union&#x27;s military budget in the 1970s was massive, 40–60% of the federal budget and 15% of GDP. Between 1972 and 1974, the two sides also agreed to strengthen their economic ties, including agreements for increased trade. As a result of their meetings, &quot;détente&quot; would replace the hostility of the Cold War and the two countries would live mutually. These developments coincided with Bonn&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; policy formulated by the West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, an effort to normalize relations between West Germany and Eastern Europe. Other agreements were concluded to stabilize the situation in Europe, culminating in the Helsinki Accords signed at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in 1975.
The Helsinki Accords, in which the Soviets promised to grant free elections in Europe, has been called a major concession to ensure peace by the Soviets. In practice, the Soviet government significantly curbed the rule of law, civil liberties, protection of law and guarantees of property, which were considered examples of &quot;bourgeois morality&quot; by Soviet legal theorists such as Andrey Vyshinsky. The Soviet Union signed legally-binding human rights documents, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1973 and the Helsinki Accords in 1975, but they were neither widely known or accessible to people living under Communist rule, nor were they taken seriously by the Communist authorities. Human rights activists in the Soviet Union were regularly subjected to harassment, repressions and arrests.

The pro-Soviet American business magnate Armand Hammer of Occidental Petroleum often mediated trade relations. Author Daniel Yergin, in his book &quot;The Prize&quot;, writes that Hammer &quot;ended up as a go-between for five Soviet General Secretaries and seven U.S. Presidents.&quot; Hammer had extensive business relationship in the Soviet Union stretching back to the 1920s with Lenin&#x27;s approval. According to &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; in 1980, &quot;although his business dealings with the Soviet Union were cut short when Stalin came to power, he had more or less single-handedly laid the groundwork for the [1980] state of Western trade with the Soviet Union.&quot;
Kissinger and Nixon were &quot;realists&quot; who deemphasized idealistic goals like anti-communism or promotion of democracy worldwide because those goals were too expensive in terms of America&#x27;s economic capabilities. They rejected &quot;idealism&quot; as impractical and too expensive, and neither man showed much sensitivity to the plight of people living under Communism. Kissinger&#x27;s realism fell out of fashion as idealism returned to American foreign policy with Carter&#x27;s moralism emphasizing human rights, and Reagan&#x27;s rollback strategy aimed at destroying Communism.

===Late 1970s deterioration of relations===
In the 1970s, the KGB, led by Yuri Andropov, continued to persecute distinguished Soviet dissidents, such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov, who were criticising the Soviet leadership in harsh terms. Indirect conflict between the superpowers continued through this period of détente in the Third World, particularly during political crises in the Middle East, Chile, Ethiopia, and Angola.

In 1973, Nixon announced his administration was committed to seeking most favored nation trade status with the USSR, which was challenged by Congress in the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. The United States had long linked trade with the Soviet Union to its foreign policy toward the Soviet Union and, especially since the early 1980s, to Soviet human rights policies. The Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which was attached to the 1974 Trade Act, linked the granting of most-favored-nation to the USSR to the right of persecuted Soviet Jews to emigrate. Because the Soviet Union refused the right of emigration to Jewish refuseniks, the ability of the President to apply most-favored nation trade status to the Soviet Union was restricted.

Although President Jimmy Carter tried to place another limit on the arms race with a SALT II agreement in 1979, his efforts were undermined by the other events that year, including the Iranian Revolution and the Nicaraguan Revolution, which both ousted pro-US governments, and his retaliation against the Soviet coup in Afghanistan in December.

== Renewal of tensions (1979–1985) ==

The period in the late 1970s and early 1980s showed an intensive reawakening of Cold War tensions and conflicts. Tensions greatly increased between the major powers with both sides becoming more militant. Diggins says, &quot;Reagan went all out to fight the second cold war, by supporting counterinsurgencies in the third world.&quot; Cox says, &quot;The intensity of this &#x27;second&#x27; Cold War was as great as its duration was short.&quot;

===Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and end of détente===

In April 1978, the communist People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in Afghanistan in the Saur Revolution. Within months, opponents of the communist regime launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a civil war waged by guerrilla mujahideen against government forces countrywide. The Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen insurgents received military training and weapons in neighboring Pakistan and China, while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government. Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA—the dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parcham—resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup. By mid-1979, the United States had started a covert program to assist the mujahideen.

In September 1979, Khalqist President Nur Muhammad Taraki was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member Hafizullah Amin, who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces during Operation Storm-333 in December 1979. Afghan forces suffered losses during the Soviet operation; 30 Afghan palace guards and over 300 army guards were killed while another 150 were captured. In the aftermath of the operation, a total of 1,700 Afghan soldiers who surrendered to Soviet forces were taken as prisoners, and the Soviets installed Babrak Karmal, the leader of the PDPA&#x27;s Parcham faction, as Amin&#x27;s successor. Veterans of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Alpha Group have stated that Operation Storm-333 was one of the most successful in the unit&#x27;s history. Documents released following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s revealed that the Soviet leadership believed Amin had secret contacts within the American embassy in Kabul and &quot;was capable of reaching an agreement with the United States&quot;; however, allegations of Amin colluding with the Americans have been widely discredited. The PDBA was tasked to fill the vacuum and carried out a purge of Amin supporters. Soviet troops were deployed to put Afghanistan under Soviet control with Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did not expect to do most of the fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan.
Carter responded to the Soviet invasion by withdrawing the SALT II treaty from ratification, imposing embargoes on grain and technology shipments to the USSR, and demanding a significant increase in military spending, and further announced the boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which was joined by 65 other nations. He described the Soviet incursion as &quot;the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War&quot;.

===Reagan and Thatcher===


In January 1977, four years prior to becoming president, Ronald Reagan bluntly stated, in a conversation with Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. &quot;My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic,&quot; he said. &quot;It is this: We win and they lose.&quot; In 1980, Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere. Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an &quot;evil empire&quot; and predicted that Communism would be left on the &quot;ash heap of history,&quot; while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as &quot;bent on world dominance.&quot; In 1982, Reagan tried to cut off Moscow&#x27;s access to hard currency by impeding its proposed gas line to Western Europe. It hurt the Soviet economy, but it also caused ill will among American allies in Europe who counted on that revenue. Reagan retreated on this issue.

By early 1985, Reagan&#x27;s anti-communist position had developed into a stance known as the new Reagan Doctrine—which, in addition to containment, formulated an additional right to subvert existing communist governments. Besides continuing Carter&#x27;s policy of supporting the Islamic opponents of the Soviet Union and the Soviet-backed PDPA government in Afghanistan, the CIA also sought to weaken the Soviet Union itself by promoting Islamism in the majority-Muslim Central Asian Soviet Union. Additionally, the CIA encouraged anti-communist Pakistan&#x27;s ISI to train Muslims from around the world to participate in the jihad against the Soviet Union.

===Polish Solidarity movement and martial law===
Pope John Paul II provided a moral focus for anti-communism; a visit to his native Poland in 1979 stimulated a religious and nationalist resurgence centered on the Solidarity movement trade union that galvanized opposition, and may have led to his attempted assassination two years later. In December 1981, Poland&#x27;s Wojciech Jaruzelski reacted to the crisis by imposing a period of martial law. Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland in response. Mikhail Suslov, the Kremlin&#x27;s top ideologist, advised Soviet leaders not to intervene if Poland fell under the control of Solidarity, for fear it might lead to heavy economic sanctions, resulting in a catastrophe for the Soviet economy.

===US and USSR military and economic issues===

The Soviet Union had built up a military that consumed as much as 25 percent of its gross national product at the expense of consumer goods and investment in civilian sectors. Soviet spending on the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, which experienced at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years.

Soviet investment in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity but in large part by the interests of the nomenklatura, which was dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges. The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in the world in terms of the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their military–industrial base. However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West. For example, the Persian Gulf War demonstrated how the armor, fire control systems, and firing range of the Soviet Union&#x27;s most common main battle tank, the T-72, were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams, yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T-72s as the US deployed M1s.
By the early 1980s, the USSR had built up a military arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, President Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history. The American-Soviet tensions present during 1983 was defined by some as the start of &quot;Cold War II&quot;. While in retrospective this phase of the Cold War was generally defined as a &quot;war of words&quot;, the Soviet&#x27;s &quot;peace offensive&quot; was largely rejected by the West.

Tensions continued to intensify as Reagan revived the B-1 Lancer program, which had been canceled by the Carter administration, produced LGM-118 Peacekeeper missiles, installed US cruise missiles in Europe, and announced the experimental Strategic Defense Initiative, dubbed &quot;Star Wars&quot; by the media, a defense program to shoot down missiles in mid-flight. The Soviets deployed RSD-10 Pioneer ballistic missiles targeting Western Europe, and NATO decided, under the impetus of the Carter presidency, to deploy MGM-31 Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe, primarily West Germany. This deployment placed missiles just 10 minutes&#x27; striking distance from Moscow.

After Reagan&#x27;s military buildup, the Soviet Union did not respond by further building its military, because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union as oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.
On 1 September 1983, the Soviet Union shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, a Boeing 747 with 269 people aboard, including sitting Congressman Larry McDonald, an action which Reagan characterized as a massacre. The airliner was en route from Anchorage to Seoul but owing to a navigational mistake made by the crew, it flew through Russian prohibited airspace. The Soviet Air Force treated the unidentified aircraft as an intruding U.S. spy plane and destroyed it with air-to-air missiles. The incident increased support for military deployment, overseen by Reagan, which stood in place until the later accords between Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. During the early hours of 26 September 1983, the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident occurred; systems in Serpukhov-15 underwent a glitch that claimed several intercontinental ballistic missiles were heading towards Russia, but officer Stanislav Petrov correctly suspected it was a false alarm, ensuring the Soviets did not respond to the non-existent attack. As such, he has been credited as &quot;the man who saved the world&quot;. The Able Archer 83 exercise in November 1983, a realistic simulation of a coordinated NATO nuclear release, was perhaps the most dangerous moment since the Cuban Missile Crisis, as the Soviet leadership feared that a nuclear attack might be imminent.

American domestic public concerns about intervening in foreign conflicts persisted from the end of the Vietnam War. The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick, low-cost counterinsurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts. In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. While Reagan&#x27;s interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy. The Reagan administration&#x27;s backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.

Meanwhile, the Soviets incurred high costs for their own foreign interventions. Although Brezhnev was convinced in 1979 that the Soviet war in Afghanistan would be brief, Muslim guerrillas, aided by the US, China, Britain, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, waged a fierce resistance against the invasion. The Kremlin sent nearly 100,000 troops to support its puppet regime in Afghanistan, leading many outside observers to dub the war &quot;the Soviets&#x27; Vietnam&quot;. However, Moscow&#x27;s quagmire in Afghanistan was far more disastrous for the Soviets than Vietnam had been for the Americans because the conflict coincided with a period of internal decay and domestic crisis in the Soviet system.

A senior US State Department official predicted such an outcome as early as 1980, positing that the invasion resulted in part from a:

==Final years (1985–1991)==
===Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms===


By the time the comparatively youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s. These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state.

An ineffectual start led to the conclusion that deeper structural changes were necessary, and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called &quot;perestroika&quot;, or restructuring. Perestroika relaxed the production quota system, allowed cooperative ownership of small businesses and paved the way for foreign investment. These measures were intended to redirect the country&#x27;s resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector.

Despite initial skepticism in the West, the new Soviet leader proved to be committed to reversing the Soviet Union&#x27;s deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West. Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced &quot;glasnost&quot;, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions. &quot;Glasnost&quot; was intended to reduce the corruption at the top of the Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the Western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.

===Thaw in relations===

In response to the Kremlin&#x27;s military and political concessions, Reagan agreed to renew talks on economic issues and the scaling-back of the arms race. The first summit was held in November 1985 in Geneva, Switzerland. A second summit was held in October 1986 in Reykjavík, Iceland. Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagan&#x27;s proposed Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), which Gorbachev wanted to be eliminated. Reagan refused. The negotiations failed, but the third summit (Washington Summit (1987), 8–10 December 1987) led to a breakthrough with the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). The INF treaty eliminated all nuclear-armed, ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between and their infrastructure.
During 1988, it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies, along with the cost of maintaining massive troops levels, represented a substantial economic drain. In addition, the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as irrelevant and the Soviets officially declared that they would no longer intervene in the affairs of satellite states in Central and Eastern Europe. George H. W. Bush and Gorbachev met at the Moscow Summit in May 1988 and the Governors Island Summit in December 1988.

In 1989, Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan without achieving their objectives. Later that year, the Berlin Wall, the Inner German border and the Iron Curtain fell. On 3 December 1989, Gorbachev and Bush declared the Cold War over at the Malta Summit. In February 1990, Gorbachev agreed with the US-proposed Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany and signed it on 12 September 1990, paving the way for the German reunification. When the Berlin Wall came down, Gorbachev&#x27;s &quot;Common European Home&quot; concept began to take shape. The two former adversaries were partners in the Gulf War against Iraq (August 1990 – February 1991). During the final summit in Moscow in July 1991, Gorbachev and Bush signed the START I arms control treaty.

===Eastern Europe breaks away===

Two developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union&#x27;s economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process. Kenneth S. Deffeyes argued in &quot;Beyond Oil&quot; that the Reagan administration encouraged Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil, and resulted in the depletion of the country&#x27;s hard currency reserves.

Brezhnev&#x27;s next two successors, transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition, did not last long. Yuri Andropov was 68 years old and Konstantin Chernenko 72 when they assumed power; both died in less than two years. In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected Mikhail Gorbachev. He made significant changes in the economy and party leadership, called &quot;perestroika&quot;. His policy of &quot;glasnost&quot; freed public access to information after decades of heavy government censorship. Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War. In 1988, the USSR abandoned its war in Afghanistan and began to withdraw its forces. In the following year, Gorbachev refused to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet satellite states, which paved the way for the Revolutions of 1989. In particular, the standstill of the Soviet Union at the Pan-European Picnic in August 1989 then set a peaceful chain reaction in motion, at the end of which the Eastern Bloc collapsed. With the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and with East and West Germany pursuing re-unification, the Iron Curtain between the West and Soviet-occupied regions came down.

By 1989, the Soviet alliance system was on the brink of collapse, and, deprived of Soviet military support, the communist leaders of the Warsaw Pact states were losing power. Grassroots organizations, such as Poland&#x27;s Solidarity movement, rapidly gained ground with strong popular bases.
The Pan-European Picnic in August 1989 in Hungary finally started a peaceful movement that the rulers in the Eastern Bloc could not stop. It was the largest movement of refugees from East Germany since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 and ultimately brought about the fall of the Iron Curtain. The patrons of the picnic, Otto von Habsburg and the Hungarian Minister of State Imre Pozsgay, saw the planned event as an opportunity to test Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s reaction. The Austrian branch of the Paneuropean Union, which was then headed by Karl von Habsburg, distributed thousands of brochures inviting the GDR holidaymakers in Hungary to a picnic near the border at Sopron. But with the mass exodus at the Pan-European Picnic the subsequent hesitant behavior of the ruling Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the non-interference of the Soviet Union broke the dams. Now tens of thousands of media-informed East Germans made their way to Hungary, which was no longer willing to keep its borders completely closed or to oblige its border troops to use armed force. On the one hand, this caused disagreement among the Eastern European states and, on the other hand, it was clear to the Eastern European population that the governments no longer had absolute power.
In 1989, the communist governments in Poland and Hungary became the first to negotiate the organization of competitive elections. In Czechoslovakia and East Germany, mass protests unseated entrenched communist leaders. The communist regimes in Bulgaria and Romania also crumbled, in the latter case as the result of a violent uprising. Attitudes had changed enough that US Secretary of State James Baker suggested that the American government would not be opposed to Soviet intervention in Romania, on behalf of the opposition, to prevent bloodshed.

The tidal wave of change culminated with the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, which symbolized the collapse of European communist governments and graphically ended the Iron Curtain divide of Europe. The 1989 revolutionary wave swept across Central and Eastern Europe and peacefully overthrew all of the Soviet-style Marxist–Leninist states: East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria; Romania was the only Eastern-bloc country to topple its communist regime violently and execute its head of state.

===Soviet dissolution===


At the same time, the Soviet republics started legal moves towards potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories, citing the freedom to secede in Article 72 of the USSR constitution. On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum. Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990. Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the &#x27;War of Laws&#x27;. In 1989, the Russian SFSR convened a newly elected Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies. Boris Yeltsin was elected its chairman. On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russia&#x27;s sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the Soviet laws. After a landslide victory of Sąjūdis in Lithuania, that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990, citing the illegality of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states. Soviet forces attempted to halt the secession by crushing popular demonstrations in Lithuania (Bloody Sunday) and Latvia (The Barricades), as a result, numerous civilians were killed or wounded. However, these actions only bolstered international support for the secessionists.
A referendum for the preservation of the USSR was held on 17 March 1991 in nine republics (the remainder having boycotted the vote), with the majority of the population in those republics voting for preservation of the Union in the form of a new federation. The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost. In the summer of 1991, the New Union Treaty, which would have turned the country into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight republics. The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the August Coup—an attempted coup d&#x27;état by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms and reassert the central government&#x27;s control over the republics. After the coup collapsed, Russian president Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions, while Gorbachev&#x27;s power was effectively ended. The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics. In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence (following Lithuania&#x27;s 1990 example). Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late August, and soon afterwards, the party&#x27;s activities were indefinitely suspended—effectively ending its rule. By the fall, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside Moscow, and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who had been elected President of Russia in July 1991.
Later in August, Gorbachev resigned as general secretary of the Communist party, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered the seizure of Soviet property. Gorbachev clung to power as the President of the Soviet Union until 25 December 1991, when the USSR dissolved. Fifteen states emerged from the Soviet Union, with by far the largest and most populous one (which also was the founder of the Soviet state with the October Revolution in Petrograd), the Russian Federation, taking full responsibility for all the rights and obligations of the USSR under the Charter of the United Nations, including the financial obligations. As such, Russia assumed the Soviet Union&#x27;s UN membership and permanent membership on the Security Council, nuclear stockpile and the control over the armed forces.
In his 1992 State of the Union Address, US President George H. W. Bush expressed his emotions: &quot;The biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America won the Cold War.&quot; Bush and Yeltsin met in February 1992, declaring a new era of &quot;friendship and partnership&quot;. In January 1993, Bush and Yeltsin agreed to START II, which provided for further nuclear arms reductions on top of the original START treaty.

==Aftermath==

In summing up the international ramifications of these events, Vladislav Zubok stated: &#x27;The collapse of the Soviet empire was an event of epochal geopolitical, military, ideological, and economic significance.&#x27; After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia drastically cut military spending, and restructuring the economy left millions unemployed. According to Western analysis, the neoliberal reforms in Russia culminated in a recession in the early 1990s more severe than the Great Depression as experienced by the United States and Germany. Western analysts suggest that in the 25 years following the end of the Cold War, only five or six of the post-communist states are on a path to joining the rich and capitalist world while most are falling behind, some to such an extent that it will take several decades to catch up to where they were before the collapse of communism.

===Decommunization===
Stephen Holmes of the University of Chicago argued in 1996 that decommunization, after a brief active period, quickly ended in near-universal failure. After the introduction of lustration, demand for scapegoats has become relatively low, and former communists have been elected for high governmental and other administrative positions. Holmes notes that the only real exception was former East Germany, where thousands of former Stasi informers have been fired from public positions.

Holmes suggests the following reasons for the failure of decommunization:
*After 45–70 years of communist rule, nearly every family has members associated with the state. After the initial desire &quot;to root out the reds&quot; came a realization that massive punishment is wrong and finding only some guilty is hardly justice.
*The urgency of the current economic problems of postcommunism makes the crimes of the communist past &quot;old news&quot; for many citizens.
*Decommunization is believed to be a power game of elites.
*The difficulty of dislodging the social elite makes it require a totalitarian state to disenfranchise the &quot;enemies of the people&quot; quickly and efficiently and a desire for normalcy overcomes the desire for punitive justice.
*Very few people have a perfectly clean slate and so are available to fill the positions that require significant expertise.

Compared with the decommunization efforts of the other former constituents of the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union, decommunization in Russia has been restricted to half-measures, if conducted at all. Notable anti-communist measures in the Russian Federation include the banning of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (and the creation of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation) as well as changing the names of some Russian cities back to what they were before the 1917 October Revolution (Leningrad to Saint Petersburg, Sverdlovsk to Yekaterinburg and Gorky to Nizhny Novgorod), though others were maintained, with Ulyanovsk (former Simbirsk), Tolyatti (former Stavropol) and Kirov (former Vyatka) being examples. Even though Leningrad and Sverdlovsk were renamed, regions that were named after them are still officially called Leningrad and Sverdlovsk oblasts.
Nostalgia for the Soviet Union is gradually on the rise in Russia. Communist symbols continue to form an important part of the rhetoric used in state-controlled media, as banning on them in other countries is seen by the Russian foreign ministry as &quot;sacrilege&quot; and &quot;a perverse idea of good and evil&quot;. The process of decommunization in Ukraine, a neighbouring post-Soviet state, was met with fierce criticism by Russia. The State Anthem of the Russian Federation, adopted in 2000 (the same year Vladimir Putin began his first term as president of Russia), uses the exact same music as the State Anthem of the Soviet Union, but with new lyrics written by Sergey Mikhalkov.

Conversely, decommunization in Ukraine started during and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 With the success of the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, the Ukrainian government approved laws that outlawed communist symbols. In July 2015, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a set of laws that started a six-month period for the removal of communist monuments (excluding World War II monuments) and renaming of public places named after communist-related themes. At the time, this meant that 22 cities and 44 villages were set to get new names. In 2016, 51,493 streets and 987 cities and villages were renamed, and 1,320 Lenin monuments and 1,069 monuments to other communist figures removed. Violation of the law carries a penalty of a potential media ban and prison sentences of up to five years. The Ministry of the Interior stripped the Communist Party of Ukraine, the Communist Party of Ukraine (renewed), and the Communist Party of Workers and Peasants of their right to participate in elections and stated it was continuing the court actions that started in July 2014 to end the registration of . By 16 December 2015, these three parties had been banned in Ukraine; the Communist Party of Ukraine appealed the ban to the European Court of Human Rights.

=== Collapse of Yugoslavia and Balkan conflicts ===

The Cold War had provided external stabilizing pressures. Both the United States and the Soviet Union had a vested interest in Yugoslavia’s stability, ensuring it remained a buffer state in the East-West divide. This resulted in financial and political support for its regime. When the Cold War ended, this external support evaporated, leaving Yugoslavia more vulnerable to internal divisions.

As Yugoslavia fragmented, the wars began after Slovenia and Croatia declared independence in 1991. Serbia, under Slobodan Milošević, opposed these moves. The Bosnian War (1992–1995) was the most brutal of the Yugoslav Wars, characterized by ethnic cleansing and genocide. International organizations, including the United Nations, struggled to manage the violence. NATO eventually intervened with airstrikes in Bosnia (1995) as part of Operation Deliberate Force and later in Kosovo (1999) as part of Operation allied force. These interventions marked the transition of NATO as a deterrent to the Soviet Union, to also functioning at the time as an active peacekeeping and conflict-resolution force.

==Influence==
The post-Cold War world is considered to be unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower. The Cold War defined the political role of the United States after World War II—by 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries, with 526,000 troops stationed abroad, with 326,000 in Europe (two-thirds of which were in West Germany) and 130,000 in Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea). The Cold War also marked the zenith of peacetime military–industrial complexes and large-scale military funding of science.
Cumulative US military expenditures throughout the entire Cold War amounted to an estimated $8 trillion. Nearly 100,000 Americans died in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Although Soviet casualties are difficult to estimate, as a share of gross national product the financial cost for the Soviet Union was much higher than that incurred by the United States.

Millions died in the superpowers&#x27; proxy wars around the globe, most notably in eastern Asia. Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War; interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, as well as refugee and displaced persons crises have declined sharply in the post-Cold War years.

However, the aftermath of the Cold War is not considered to be concluded. Many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control in a number of areas formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.

==In popular culture==
The Cold War endures as a popular topic reflected in entertainment media, and continuing to the present with post-1991 Cold War-themed feature films, novels, television and web series, and other media. In 2013, a KGB-sleeper-agents-living-next-door action drama series, &quot;The Americans&quot;, set in the early 1980s, was ranked No. 6 on the Metacritic annual Best New TV Shows list; its six-season run concluded in May 2018.

==Historiography==
Interpreting the course and origins of the conflict has been a source of heated controversy among historians, political scientists, and journalists. In particular, historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of Soviet–US relations after the Second World War; and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable or could have been avoided. Historians have also disagreed on what exactly the Cold War was, what the sources of the conflict were, and how to disentangle patterns of action and reaction between the two sides.

Although explanations of the origins of the conflict in academic discussions are complex and diverse, several general schools of thought on the subject can be identified. Historians commonly speak of three different approaches to the study of the Cold War: &quot;orthodox&quot; accounts, &quot;revisionism&quot;, and &quot;post-revisionism&quot;.

&quot;Orthodox&quot; accounts place responsibility for the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its expansion further into Europe. &quot;Revisionist&quot; writers place more responsibility for the breakdown of post-war peace on the United States, citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II. &quot;Post-revisionists&quot; see the events of the Cold War as more nuanced and attempt to be more balanced in determining what occurred during the Cold War. Much of the historiography on the Cold War weaves together two or even all three of these broad categories.

<text>Glen Anthony Rice Sr. (born May 28, 1967) is an American former professional basketball player who played in the National Basketball Association (NBA). As a small forward, Rice was a three-time NBA All-Star and made 1,559 three-point field goals during his 15-year career. Rice won both an NCAA championship and NBA championship during his collegiate and professional career. In recent years, Rice has taken up mixed martial arts fight promotion as owner of G-Force Fights based in Miami, Florida.

==Early life==
Glen Anthony Rice Sr. was born on May 28, 1967, in Jacksonville, Arkansas. He attended Flint Northwestern High School in Flint, Michigan, where he excelled in basketball.

==College career==
Rice played college basketball for the University of Michigan Wolverines for four seasons (1985–1989), a starter for three of those seasons. He became the school&#x27;s all-time leading scorer with 2,442 points. He led Michigan to the 1989 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship, scoring an NCAA-record 184 points in tournament play, a record that still stands. Rice was also voted the tournament&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player and was part of the Associated Press All-America second-team, after averaging 25.6 points for the season, while shooting 58% from the floor and 52% from three-point range. After Rice&#x27;s junior year, he was invited to try out for the 1988 United States Olympic basketball team, but he was cut before reaching the group of 48. On February 20, 2005, Rice&#x27;s No. 41 jersey was retired during a ceremony at Michigan&#x27;s Crisler Arena. Rice made the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; on April 10, 1989.

Rice continues to rank among Michigan&#x27;s all-time leaders in several statistical categories, including:
*1st in men&#x27;s career points (2,442)
*1st in single-season points (949 in the 1988–89 season)
*1st in single-season field goals made (363 in the 1988–89 season)
*1st in single-season field goal attempts (629 in the 1988–89 season)
*1st in single-season three-point field goal percent (51.6% in the 1988–89 season)
*2nd in career field goals made (1,003)
*2nd in single-season three-point field goals made (99 in the 1988–89 season)

==Professional career==
Rice started his senior season as a projected mid-first-round selection, but his stock rose due to his record-breaking performance in the NCAA Tournament, and he was selected #4 overall in the 1989 NBA draft by the Miami Heat.

===Miami Heat (1989–1995)===
The Heat was an expansion team in the NBA and was now in their second-year in need of some offensive help after finishing last in the NBA in points per game in 1988–89. Joining other young players such as Sherman Douglas and Rony Seikaly, Rice would be called upon to deliver some of the scoring load despite being a rookie. Starting in 60 games, Rice averaged 13.6 points per game his rookie season just behind Douglas and Seikaly, but the lottery-bound Heat only won 18 games. The following year only saw modest improvement for the team from 18 wins to 24 wins, but Rice started in every game he played and increased his scoring load to 17.4 points a game while leading the team in three-point field goals with 71.

The 1991–92 season would prove to be a breakthrough season for Rice and the Heat, as the team improved to 38 wins and featured other young players such as Steve Smith and Brian Shaw. By now Rice had become the team&#x27;s leading scorer and averaged 22.3 points a game with 155 three-point field goals (second in the league), leading the Heat to its first playoff series in which the young team was swept by the defending champion Chicago Bulls led by Michael Jordan. Despite this, the Heat won fewer games the following year, while Rice&#x27;s scoring average slipped to 19 as the scoring load of Seikaly and Smith increased.

Rice averaged 21.1 points a game in the 1993–94 season and led the Heat back into the playoffs and to their first-ever playoff game win against the Atlanta Hawks, but the Heat were unable to win the hard-fought first-round series in which the Hawks prevailed 3 games to 2.

In the 1994–95 season, Rice averaged 22.3 points a game (10th in the league) and made 185 three-point shots (6th in the league). Despite not being selected to play in the annual NBA All-Star Game, Rice participated in the NBA All-Star Long Distance Shootout at the 1995 All-Star game in Phoenix, and won the contest, edging out another sharp-shooter, Reggie Miller. Later during the season in a nationally televised game against Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and the Orlando Magic he scored a career-high 56 points on 20 of 27 shots from the floor including 7 three-pointers. The 56 points were an NBA season-high for the 1994–95 season. Despite his success, the Heat was unable to make the playoffs.

===Charlotte Hornets (1995–1999)===
Days before the start of the 1995–96 season, newly hired Coach/GM Pat Riley organized a trade in which Rice was sent to the Charlotte Hornets along with Matt Geiger in exchange for disgruntled Hornets center Alonzo Mourning who had refused any contract negotiations.

The Hornets paired Rice with high scoring forward Larry Johnson, and the two led the team to 41 wins. Rice led the team in scoring with 21.6 points a game and led his team in three-point field goals (171) and three-point shooting percentage (42%). He was also named to play in the 1996 NBA All-Star Game, but the Hornets failed to make the playoffs.

It would be the 1996–97 season in which Rice would earn the distinction of an elite player in the league. The Hornets had acquired veteran players Vlade Divac and Anthony Mason and no longer featured Johnson, and also hiring a new head coach and NBA legend Dave Cowens. Rice averaged 26.8 points a game during the season, placing him third in the league in scoring while leading the league in three-point shooting (47%) and minutes played. His play earned him his second straight All-Star Game election, and at the 1997 NBA All-Star Game set an individual All-Star game records of 20 points in the third quarter and 24 points in the second half to finish with 26 points for the game. His 8–11 shooting performance including 4–5 three-pointer shooting and his 20 points in the third quarter broke Philadelphia guard Hal Greer&#x27;s record (19), set in 1968. By scoring 24 in a half, Rice surpassed the previous mark of 23, owned by Wilt Chamberlain and Tom Chambers. Rice&#x27;s performance is listed on the NBA&#x27;s 57 Memorable All-Star Moments. His performance helped the Eastern Conference win the game, and earned him the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award. The Hornets won 54 games, and made it into the 1997 Playoffs where they were swept 3–0 by the New York Knicks in the first round.

Rice would average 22.3 points a game (8th in the league) during the 1997–98 season, finishing second in the league in minutes played and scoring 16 points in the 1998 NBA All-Star Game. The Hornets won 51 games, and in the first round of the 1998 Playoffs, they managed to win a playoff series, defeating the Atlanta Hawks before losing to the defending champion Chicago Bulls in the second round. The 1998–99 season would start late and last only 50 games per team due to a league lockout, and on March 10, 1999, the Hornets traded Rice to the Los Angeles Lakers.

===Los Angeles Lakers (1999–2000)===

In 1999, Rice was again traded in exchange for fan favorite, Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell. The trade did not immediately sit well with Laker fans but Rice was considered the last piece of the puzzle for the Lakers to return to the NBA Finals. Rice was leaving a Hornets team in turmoil with many players demanding trades coming out of a 4-month lockout. Coach Cowens had resigned, Anthony Mason was out for the year, Rice was coming back from an elbow injury that he needed to have surgery on, and the owner was in legal trouble. The trade to the Lakers made Rice the third scorer behind Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Kobe Bryant, a trio that general manager and Laker legend Jerry West envisioned would bring Los Angeles another NBA championship. The Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the 1999 Playoffs, but Rice averaged 18 points per game.

Before the 1999–2000 season, the Lakers hired head coach Phil Jackson, who had won 6 NBA Championships with the Chicago Bulls teams that featured Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. The Lakers also acquired veterans such as Ron Harper, A.C. Green, as well as Rice&#x27;s former Miami teammates John Salley and Brian Shaw. Led by the play of O&#x27;Neal, who won the MVP award for the season, and the all-star play of Bryant, the Lakers won 67 games for first place in the Western Conference. Rice started in 80 games and averaged 15.9 points as the team&#x27;s third option with 84 three-point shots to lead the Lakers.

In the 2000 Playoffs, Rice averaged 12.4 points per game while shooting 41 percent from beyond the three-point arc, a career-best for the playoffs. The Lakers defeated the Sacramento Kings, Phoenix Suns, and Portland Trail Blazers in the first three rounds of the playoffs en route to advancing to the 2000 NBA Finals to play the Indiana Pacers. In the second game of the Finals, Bryant suffered an ankle injury, and Rice scored 21 points to help the Lakers take a 2–0 lead in the series. Rice would average 11.5 points a game for the series, including 16 points with 3 shots from three-point range in Game 6 as the Lakers defeated the Pacers 4 games to 2 to give Rice his first and only NBA championship.

Although the Lakers had won the championship, a lot of drama had unfolded behind the scenes between Rice, head coach Phil Jackson and GM Jerry West since the time between getting swept by the Spurs and the eventual championship. There was a report that Rice was upset when the Lakers exercised a $7-million option for 1999–2000 instead of letting him become a free agent. Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Rice&#x27;s close friend, believed that Rice was the pure shooter he needed to keep teams from double- and triple-teaming him in the playoffs, and felt partly responsible for bringing Rice to the Lakers (and trading Eddie Jones to do it). Rice was eventually traded to the New York Knicks.

===New York Knicks (2000–2001)===
In New York, Rice would take on a sixth-man role on the team and provide the Knicks with well-needed support off the bench. In the 2000–01 season he played in 72 games, averaging 12 points-per-game. Rice made 25 starts, averaging 14.2 points and 5.2 rebounds in those games and led the Knicks in scoring 9 times. While Rice&#x27;s defense is often singled out as the reason for his departure, he ranks 145th among all-time NBA players in career steals (958). His tenure with the Knicks lasted only one year, as he was hobbled by a foot injury (plantar fasciitis) and was unable to find a niche in New York behind Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell. After the season in which the Knicks lost in five games to the Toronto Raptors in the first round of the 2001 Playoffs, he would eventually be traded to the Houston Rockets for Shandon Anderson.

===Houston Rockets (2001–2003)===
In Houston, Rice joined a young team featuring Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley and was initially excited about returning to a starting role after being relegated to more of a third-option with both the Lakers and Knicks. Things started slowly in Houston as Rice was still on the mend, rehabbing from his foot injury which limited him to just 20 games in the 2001–02 season. The following year, he would manage to play in 62 games including 26 starts to average 9 points a game for a Rockets team that now featured center Yao Ming. Following the 2003 season he would be traded to the Utah Jazz for John Amaechi, but would then sign with the Los Angeles Clippers.

===Los Angeles Clippers (2003–2004)===
A knee injury (partially torn tendon) ultimately derailed and eventually brought Rice&#x27;s career to an end. In his final season with the Clippers, he became the 48th player in NBA history to score 18,000 career points. Fittingly, it was on February 18, 2004, against the Lakers, and he would retire after playing just 18 games.

==Personal life==
A book claimed that Rice had an alleged affair with Sarah Palin in 1987, which Rice said was a &quot;respectful encounter&quot;.

Rice&#x27;s son, Glen Rice Jr. (born January 1, 1991), was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the 35th overall pick of the 2013 NBA draft.

Rice also has five other children: G&#x27;mitri Rice (born April 22, 1992), Brianna Rice (born February 26, 1999), Giancarlo Rice (born August 28, 2001), Giovanni Rice (born February 5, 2004) and Bella Rice (born July 28, 2010).

On January 11, 2008, Rice was arrested in Miami on suspicion of felony battery. Police say he assaulted a man that he found hiding in his estranged wife&#x27;s closet. Rice surrendered to police and was released after posting $5,000 bond. Charges were later dropped by the victim J.C.

On April 28, 2016, Rice married his longtime girlfriend and youngest daughter&#x27;s mother, Tia Santoro, at Vizcaya Museum and Gardens in Miami.

<text>Mount Magazine, officially named Magazine Mountain, is the highest point of the U.S. Interior Highlands and the U.S. state of Arkansas, and is the site of Mount Magazine State Park. It is a flat-topped mountain or mesa capped by hard rock and rimmed by precipitous cliffs. There are two summits atop the mountain: Signal Hill, which reaches , and Mossback Ridge, which reaches .

Mount Magazine is often called &quot;the highest point between the Alleghenies and the Rockies&quot; (there are mountains located in the Trans-Pecos region of far-west Texas which exceed Mount Magazine in elevation and prominence, although the Trans-Pecos region lies so far south of the Rockies, that region arguably lies not &quot;between&quot; the Allegheny Mountains and the Rocky Mountains).

==Etymology==
According to English botanist Thomas Nuttall, writing in 1819, French hunters named the mountain &quot;Magazine&quot; or &quot;Barn&quot; (French ) because of its &quot;peculiar form&quot;.
However, today some scholars believe Nuttall may have been writing about nearby Mount Nebo, and what is today called Mount Magazine was labeled &quot;Castete Mt&quot; on Nuttall&#x27;s maps.

==Location==

Mount Magazine is located due north of Blue Mountain Lake in Logan County, Arkansas, approximately east of the Arkansas-Oklahoma border. The most scenic route to the top is a drive along Highway 309 (also known as the Mount Magazine Scenic Byway) from Havana.

Physiographically, Mount Magazine is part of the Frontal Ouachita Mountains, and is part of the Arkansas River Valley ecoregion. It lies within a southern extension of the Ozark National Forest close to the Ouachita National Forest.

== Climate ==

The climate is very different from the typical climate of Arkansas state as temperatures remain 10 degrees cooler than normal temperatures in the valleys. The annual average temperature is 56 °F. The park gets 54 inches of rainfall every year, and due to the low clouds, there is fog and limited visibility all year for eight days each month.

=== Summer ===

The summer temperature very rarely reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit on the mountaintop and the hottest average temperature during the summer in the park is 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

=== Winter ===

The mountain has limited forest due to the harsh weather during the wintertime. Normal conditions like frost, sleet, hail, snow, and freezing rain can cause the limbs of trees to snap. Higher up on the mountain, frost flowers, ice crystals, hoarfrost, rime ice, and freezing fog can occur.
==Geology==

As the South American plate collided with the North American plate during the late Paleozoic, a major foreland basin, the Arkoma Basin, developed north of the Ouachita Mountains. Small grains of sediment that had filled the Arkoma Basin were compacted and cemented into sedimentary rock. As the land rose above sea level, small streams developed that eventually merged into the Arkansas River. After millions of years of erosion, synclines like Mount Magazine have become the most positive topographic features; this phenomenon is the result of the rapid weathering of shales once sandstones were breached on the flanks of surrounding anticlines.

Mount Magazine is a broad mesa composed of Pennsylvanian sedimentary rocks deposited in various shallow-water environments. Like many mountains in the western Arkansas River Valley, Mount Magazine is capped by the Savanna Formation, a sequence of shale, siltstone, and sandstone; the upper portion of this sequence is missing throughout most of Arkansas. The Savanna Formation is conformable with the underlying McAlester Formation, a sequence of shale, siltstone, sandstone, and several coal beds. The McAlester Formation is conformable with the underlying Hartshorne Sandstone, a prominent ledge-former under favorable structural conditions. The Hartshorne Sandstone is unconformable with the underlying Atoka Formation. This unit has the largest areal extent of any of the Paleozoic formations in Arkansas, extending as far north as the Boston Mountains, and is divided into upper, middle, and lower members.

== Nature &amp; Attractions ==
Mount Magazine promotes environmental conservation through an Eco-friendly nature attraction that allows visitors to explore nature. It also consists of 18 campsites for nature-lovers. An annual butterfly festival is hosted each June in the Paris town square.

=== Animals ===
The park is home to many species including the shagreen snail, black bear, white-tailed deer, rufous-crowned sparrows (rare), and 94 of the 134 butterfly species of Arkansas. The rarest butterfly species is the Diana Fritillary.

=== Activities ===
Activities include the following: hiking, biking, bird watching, horseback riding, hang gliding, rappelling, rock climbing, sightseeing, and photography. ATV riding is also allowed as there is a guide to the activity.

<doc id="325362" wikidata="Q4717318" url="?curid=325362" title="Alex Kozinski">
<text>Alex Kozinski (; born July 23, 1950) is a Romanian-American jurist and lawyer who was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1985 to 2017. He was a prominent and influential judge, and many of his law clerks went on to clerk for U.S. Supreme Court justices. 

Kozinski&#x27;s judicial career ended in 2017 when he retired after over a dozen of his former female law clerks and legal staffers accused him of sexual harassment and abusive practices. Kozinski had previously faced an ethics hearing over inappropriate sexual material.

==Early life==
Kozinski was born in July 1950 to a Romanian Jewish family in Bucharest, under the rule of the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic. Both of his parents were Holocaust survivors. Kozinski&#x27;s father, Moses, spent four years in Transnistrian concentration camps where tens of thousands of Jews perished. His mother, Sabine, lived through the war years in a Romanian ghetto.

In 1958, Kozinski&#x27;s parents applied to the Romanian government for permission to emigrate from the country. They received permission four years later in 1962, when Kozinski was 12 years old. Kozinski, who had grown up as a committed communist in Bucharest, became what he described as &quot;an instant capitalist&quot; when he took his first trip outside of the Iron Curtain, to Vienna, where he partook of such luxuries as chewing gum and bananas. Kozinski later recounted:

Kozinski&#x27;s family immigrated to the United States in 1962 and settled in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, where his father ran a small grocery store.

==Education and early career==
Kozinski studied economics at the University of California, Los Angeles, graduating in 1972 with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;cum laude&quot;. He then attended the UCLA School of Law, where he was a managing editor of the &quot;UCLA Law Review&quot;. He graduated in 1975 with a Juris Doctor ranked first in his class.

After law school, Kozinski clerked for judge (later Supreme Court justice) Anthony Kennedy of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1975 to 1976, then for chief justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1976 to 1977. He then entered private practice as an associate with the law firms Forry, Golbert, Singer &amp; Gelles from 1977 to 1979 and Covington &amp; Burling from 1979 to 1981. He was a Deputy Legal Counsel of the Office of the President-Elect in Washington, D.C. (1980–81) and an Assistant Counsel for the Office of Counsel to the President in Washington, D.C. (1981). He was a Special Counsel for the Merit Systems Protection Board in Washington, D.C. (1981–82).

===Office of Special Counsel incident===
While he was in the Office of Special Counsel, despite staff recommendations against termination, Kozinski overruled his staff and then repeatedly tutored Interior Secretary James G. Watt&#x27;s legal staff in how to rewrite the proposed termination of a mining safety whistleblower so as to pass legal muster. When the incident came to light years later during confirmation hearings for Kozinski&#x27;s Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals nomination, the scandal drew 43 Senate opposition votes and reportedly subsequently prevented Kozinski&#x27;s planned promotion to the U.S. Supreme Court.

==Federal judicial service==
Kozinski served as a trial judge of the United States Court of Claims in 1982, serving as Chief of Trial Division that year.

Kozinski was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on August 10, 1982, to the United States Claims Court, to a new seat authorized by 96 Stat. 27. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 20, 1982, and received commission on October 1, 1982. He served as Chief Judge from 1982 to 1985. His service terminated on February 9, 1985, due to resignation.

Kozinski was nominated by President Reagan on June 5, 1985, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, to a new seat created by 98 Stat. 333. Before the confirmation vote took place, former employees from Kozinski&#x27;s time at the Office of Special Counsel warned the Senate that Kozinski was &quot;harsh, cruel, demeaning, sadistic, disingenuous and without compassion.&quot; He was nonetheless confirmed by the United States Senate by a 54–43 vote on November 7, 1985. He received commission the same day. At 35, he was the youngest federal Appeals Court judge at the time of appointment.

In 2005, after concluding that the Ninth Circuit insufficiently addressed breaches of judicial conduct by Judge Manuel Real, after rules had been enacted to discourage behavior that would initiate &quot;a substantial and widespread lowering of public confidence in the courts among reasonable people,&quot; Kozinski demanded the actual imposition of higher standards, writing,&quot;It does not inspire confidence in the federal judiciary, when we treat our own so much better than we treat everyone else.&quot; Kozinski was persuasive and Real&#x27;s case was reopened and he was disciplined.

He served as Chief Judge of the circuit from December 1, 2007, to December 1, 2014. In that capacity, he received complaints about Montana Federal Presiding Judge Richard F. Cebull, who had sent hundreds of emails disparaging women, racial minorities and liberal politicians. One joked that President Barack Obama&#x27;s birth was the product of a sexual relationship between Obama&#x27;s mother and a dog. Kozinski appointed a five-judge panel to review the matter in which he was the chair. It recommended disciplinary measures but not removal; the particulars of the investigation were largely kept confidential, at Kozinski&#x27;s initiative.

===Feeder judge===
During his tenure as a court of appeals judge, he became a prominent feeder judge. Between 2009–13, he placed nine of his clerks with the United States Supreme Court, the fifth most of any judge during that time period. He was particularly successful placing his clerks with Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom he had himself clerked.

===Defense of Ninth Circuit===
In the 2000s, while defending the Ninth Circuit against criticism because of a recent controversial decision, &quot;Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow&quot;, Kozinski, who had not been part of the case, emphasized judicial independence: &quot;It seems to me that this is what makes this country truly great—that we can have a judiciary where the person who appoints you doesn&#x27;t own you.&quot; He also took a stand against the charge that the Ninth Circuit is overly liberal: &quot;I can say with some confidence that cries that the Ninth Circuit is so liberal are just simply misplaced.&quot;

On November 30, 2007, he became the tenth Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit. His term as chief judge ended on December 1, 2014, when he was succeeded by Judge Sidney R. Thomas.

===Death penalty===
In an interview on CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in April 2017, Kozinski talked about his support for the death penalty, but with the reservation that death by lethal injection should no longer be used, calling it &quot;a way of lying to ourselves, to make it look like executions are peaceful, benign&quot;. He instead advocated the use of the guillotine or firing squad, saying these methods are &quot;100 percent effective&quot; and cause &quot;no doubt that what we are doing is a violent thing&quot;.

==Notable cases==
===&quot;Thompson v. Calderon&quot;===
Thomas Martin Thompson was convicted based largely on the testimony of his fellow inmates, but doubts about the effectiveness of his defense counsel led seven former California prosecutors to file briefs on Thompson&#x27;s behalf.

The Ninth Circuit had originally denied Thompson&#x27;s habeas petition attacking the state court decision. Two days before Thompson&#x27;s scheduled execution, the Ninth Circuit &quot;en banc&quot; reversed (7–4) the earlier denial. Kozinski dissented:

Kozinski&#x27;s opinion was criticized by Judge Stephen Reinhardt, who called it &quot;bizarre and horrifying&quot; and &quot;unworthy of any jurist.&quot; The &quot;en banc&quot; decision was reversed by the Supreme Court, which called the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s action &quot;a grave abuse of discretion.&quot;

===&quot;White v. Samsung Electronics America, Inc.&quot;===
Kozinski dissented from an order rejecting the suggestion for rehearing en banc an appeal filed by Vanna White against Samsung for depicting a robot on a &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;–style set in a humorous advertisement. While the Ninth Circuit held in favor of White, Kozinski dissented: &quot;All creators draw in part on the work of those who came before, referring to it, building on it, poking fun at it; we call this creativity, not piracy.&quot; An extended extract from the opinion is widely quoted:

Kozinski&#x27;s dissent in &quot;White&quot; is also famous for his sarcastic remark that &quot;for better or worse, we are the Court of Appeals for the Hollywood Circuit.&quot;

===&quot;Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc.&quot;===

Yet another of Kozinski&#x27;s high-profile cases was the lawsuit filed by Mattel against MCA Records, the record label of Danish pop-dance group Aqua, for &quot;turning Barbie into a sex object&quot; in their 1997 song &quot;Barbie Girl.&quot; Kozinski opened his opinion with: &quot;If this were a sci-fi melodrama, it might be called Speech-Zilla meets Trademark Kong&quot; and famously concluded his 2002 opinion with the words: &quot;The parties are advised to chill.&quot;

===&quot;United States v. Ramirez-Lopez&quot; (2003)===
The majority found the due process rights of a man, who was accused of smuggling illegal immigrants across the border, were not violated despite the fact that witnesses who could have exonerated him had been deported before they could be deposed. Kozinski dissented. Federal prosecutors, however, dropped all charges and released the defendant.

In 2012, after prosecutors used similar tactics in another case, &quot;United States v. Leal-Del Carmen&quot;, Kozinski&#x27;s position in &quot;Ramirez-Lopez&quot; became the law in the Ninth Circuit.

===&quot;United States v. Isaacs&quot;===
Kozinski was assigned an obscenity case, similar to that in &quot;Miller v. California&quot;. Ira Isaacs was accused of distributing videos depicting bestiality and other images. During the trial on June 11, 2008, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Kozinski had &quot;maintained a publicly accessible Web site featuring sexually explicit photos and videos&quot; at alex.kozinski.com. The &quot;Times&quot; reported that the site included a photo of naked women on all fours painted to look like cows; a video of a half-dressed man cavorting with a sexually aroused farm animal; images of masturbation and public and contortionist sex; a slide show striptease featuring a transgender woman; a series of photos of women&#x27;s crotches as seen through snug fitting clothing or underwear; and content with themes of defecation and urination. Kozinski admitted that some of the material was inappropriate but defended other content as &quot;funny.&quot;

Calling the coverage a &quot;baseless smear&quot; by a disgruntled litigant, Stanford University law professor Lawrence Lessig pointed out that the &quot;Times&quot; had unfairly taken the videos and pictures out of context in its descriptions. He wrote that one frequently-mentioned video, the video described above as a &quot;half-dressed man cavorting with a sexually aroused farm animal,&quot; which actually involves a man running away from a donkey, is available on YouTube, and is not, as is implied by the &quot;Times&quot; article, an example of bestiality. He also argued that the Kozinski family&#x27;s right to privacy was violated when the disgruntled litigant exposed the private files, which were not intended for public viewing. Lessig compared the incident to breaking and entering a private residence.

Kozinski initially refused to comment on disqualifying himself and then granted a 48-hour stay, when the prosecutor requested time to explore &quot;a potential conflict of interest.&quot; On June 13, Kozinski petitioned an ethics panel to investigate his own conduct. He asked Chief Justice John Roberts to assign the inquiry to a panel of judges outside the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s jurisdiction. Also, he said that his son, Yale, and his family or friends may have been responsible for posting some of the material. Kozinski&#x27;s wife wrote a defense characterizing those of his posts which were alleged to be pornographic, to rather be humorous.

Kozinski had previously been involved in a dispute over government monitoring of federal court employees&#x27; computers. Administrative Office head Ralph Mecham dropped the monitoring program but protested in the press. In 2001, Kozinski, who possesses sophisticated computer skills, personally disabled software which blocked federal court computers in three appellate circuits from receiving pornography.

On June 15, 2008, it was reported that Kozinski had recused himself from the case. On June 5, 2009, the Judicial Council of the Third Circuit issued an opinion clearing Kozinski of any wrongdoing.

===&quot;Cetacean Research v. Sea Shepherd&quot;===
In February 2013, Kozinski wrote an opinion reversing a district court ruling that had denied Japanese whalers Institute of Cetacean Research a preliminary injunction against the US-based anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Kozinski found that the militant conservationist group were &quot;pirates,&quot; reversed the denial of injunction by the district court, and affirmed its own provisional injunction against Sea Shepherd. The injunction bars Sea Shepherd from approaching within 500 yards of ICS vessels.

Sea Shepherd founder Paul Watson dismissed the opinion enjoining his organization from interfering with ICS vessels as &quot;entirely devoid of real evidence&quot; and claimed that Sea Shepherd USA was in full compliance with the injunction.

===&quot;Wood v. Ryan&quot;===
In July 2014, Joseph Rudolph Wood, who had been sentenced to death, filed a motion before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals claiming a right to know which chemicals were included in the lethal injection that was to be used to execute him. While the court denied his motion, Kozinski issued a dissenting opinion, calling the use of drugs a &quot;misguided effort to mask the brutality of executions by making them look serene and peaceful.&quot; He went on to argue that states should revert to more primitive methods like the guillotine, electric chair, gas chamber, and firing squads because they are accurate and do not mask the brutality. He wrote, &quot;Sure, firing squads can be messy, but if we are willing to carry out executions, we should not shield ourselves from the reality that we are shedding human blood. If we, as a society, cannot stomach the splatter from an execution carried out by firing squad, then we shouldn&#x27;t be carrying out executions at all.&quot; Wood&#x27;s execution subsequently took 1 hour 57 min before he was pronounced dead.

===&quot;State of Washington v. Trump&quot;===
On March 17, 2017, Kozinski wrote a dissenting opinion when the Ninth Circuit denied en banc review after a three-judge panel blocked Trump&#x27;s &quot;travel ban.&quot; Joined by Jay Bybee, Consuelo Callahan, Carlos Bea, and Sandra Segal Ikuta, he argued that courts should not divine an illicit purpose from a President&#x27;s statements on the campaign trail. Kozinski was criticized by Stephen Reinhardt and Marsha Berzon in two separate concurring opinions Reinhardt referred to Kozinski&#x27;s opinion a &quot;diatribe&quot; and Berzon called it &quot;a one-sided attack on a decision by a duly constituted panel of this court.&quot; The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the &quot;travel ban&quot; against similar challenges in the 2018 case &quot;Trump v. Hawaii&quot;. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority that &quot;because there is persuasive evidence that the entry restriction has a legitimate grounding in national security concerns, quite apart from any religious hostility,&quot; the courts &quot;must accept that independent justification.&quot;

===&quot;United States v. Sanchez-Gomez&quot;===
In May 2017, Kozinski wrote for the narrowly divided &quot;en banc&quot; circuit when it found that the United States District Court for the Southern District of California&#x27;s policy of indiscriminately shackling criminal defendants in all pretrial hearings violated the Constitution&#x27;s Due Process Clause. In March 2018, the court&#x27;s judgment was vacated as moot by the unanimous Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;United States v. Sanchez-Gomez.&quot;

== Investigations ==

=== Personal website ===
In 2008, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; revealed Kozinski &quot;maintained a publicly accessible website featuring sexually explicit photos and videos.&quot; Kozinski had collected a &quot;vast&quot; number of images sent to him via e-mail over many years and retained them on a personal web server in his home. Kozinski believed that only invited friends and family were able to view the image directory. Nonetheless, he called for an ethics investigation of himself, and was suspended from presiding over the obscenity trial of Ira Isaacs.

In July 2009, a panel, headed by Judge Anthony Joseph Scirica, wrote that Kozinski should have administered his web server more carefully, but that Kozinski&#x27;s apology and deletion of the website, in addition to the panel&#x27;s admonishment and the public dissemination of it, sufficiently ended the matter.

=== Sexual misconduct ===
Kozinski has been accused of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to assault, by more than 15 women. Former Kozinski clerk Katherine Ku has described Kozinski&#x27;s chambers—where three or four law clerks, one or two judicial assistants, and one or more judicial externs typically worked at a given time—as a &quot;hostile, demeaning and persistently sexualized environment.&quot; An image posted on the legal gossip blog Underneath their Robes shows a female law clerk with her arm draped around Kozinski&#x27;s neck.

Some former Kozinski clerks have observed that because Kozinski retired from the bench after the first 15 women accused him of misconduct, &quot;additional targets of, or witnesses to, Kozinski&#x27;s transgressions&quot; will not be likely to speak publicly. His former clerk, Brett Kavanaugh, during his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee taking up his nomination for the Supreme Court, received written questions tendered to him by Senator Chris Coons about any knowledge of Kozinski&#x27;s inappropriate behavior, including his circulations of sexually explicit emails via his &quot;Easy Rider Gag List.&quot; Kavanaugh denied knowing anything about the allegations against Kozinski prior to the publication of a news article about them in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; in December 2017.

Public allegations of Kozinski&#x27;s sexual misconduct toward female lawyers and law students include:

* Romance novelist Heidi Bond, who once clerked for Kozinski, accused Kozinski of calling her into his office, pulling up pornography on his computer, and asking if she thought it was Photoshopped or if it aroused her sexually; when she said no, she alleged, he interrogated her as to why it did not. 
* A former Kozinski clerk said Kozinski, in his chambers, showed her an &quot;open-legged image of a male figure that was naked.&quot;
* &quot;One recent law student at the University of Montana said that Kozinski, at a 2016 reception, pressed his finger into the side of her breast, which was covered by her clothes, and moved it with some &#x27;deliberateness&#x27; to the center, purporting to be pushing aside her lapel to fully see her name tag.&quot;
* A lawyer &quot;said Kozinski approached her when she was alone in a room at a legal community event around 2008 in downtown Los Angeles and — with no warning — gave her a bear hug and kissed her on the lips.&quot;
* University of California at Irvine law professor Leah Litman said at a 2017 dinner, Kozinski pinched her and joked that he had just had sex with his wife and she or others at the table would be &quot;happy to know it still works.&quot;
* Former U.S. Court of Federal Claims judge Christine Odell Cook Miller, 73, said that &quot;around early 1986 said Kozinski grabbed and squeezed each of her breasts as the two drove back from an event in Baltimore in the mid-1980s, after she had told him she did not want to stop at a motel and have sex.&quot;
* Dahlia Lithwick wrote in &quot;Slate&quot; that when she was clerking for another judge on the Ninth Circuit and Kozinski learned she was in a hotel room, he asked her what she was wearing.
* Emily Murphy, who was clerking for another Ninth Circuit judge at the time and later became a professor at UC Hastings, said Kozinski suggested to a group that she exercise naked in the courthouse gymnasium. Murphy has said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just clear that he was imagining me naked, he was trying to invite other people — my professional colleagues — to do so as well. That was what was humiliating about it.&quot; 
* A former Ninth Circuit clerk reported that in late 2011 or early 2012, she found herself sitting next to Kozinski at a dinner in Seattle. He &quot;kind of picked the tablecloth up so that he could see the bottom half of me, my legs,&quot; and he remarked, &quot;I wanted to see if you were wearing pants because it&#x27;s cold out.&quot; 
* A &quot;former Ninth Circuit clerk said that at a dinner with other clerks, Kozinski brought up a movie that contained a topless woman, talking about her &#x27;voluptuous&#x27; breasts. The woman . . . said she made a face to signal her disbelief at what he was saying, and Kozinski turned to her and said something like, &#x27;What? I&#x27;m a man.&#x27;&quot;
* One &quot;former Kozinski extern said the judge once made a comment about her hair and looked her body up and down &#x27;in a less-than-professional way.&#x27; That extern said Kozinski also once talked with her about a female judge stripping.&quot; The clerk said she wouldn&#x27;t want to be alone with Kozinski. 
* A former extern said she had at least two conversations with Kozinski &quot;that had sexual overtones directed at me.&quot;

=== Employment practices ===
Former clerks also describe abusive employment practices by Kozinski. For many years, Judge Kozinski&#x27;s job announcement stated that &quot;I&#x27;m looking for amazingly intelligent Supreme Court clerk wannabes eager to slave like dogs for an unreasonably demanding boss.&quot; Former law clerk Heidi Bond described how Kozinski forbade her from reading romance novels during her dinner break: the Judge asserted, &quot;I control what you read, what you write, when you eat. You don&#x27;t sleep if I say so. You don&#x27;t &quot;shit&quot; unless I say so. Do you understand?&quot; Bond also described interactions consistent with cycles of abuse.
This sort of diatribe was a regular occurrence. The judge had incredibly high standards, and when we failed to meet them, we were raked over the coals. I do not think a week passed without at least one such outburst; during bad times, they were a daily occurrence. He also had an innate sense of when he&#x27;d gone too far.

After he&#x27;d demonstrated that he had forgiven me for the misplaced comma or misspelled word that gave rise to his outburst, he would go up to me. &quot;Heidi, honey,&quot; he would ask. &quot;Do you still love me?&quot; There was only one answer. To say &quot;no&quot; would be to invite the tempest a second time. &quot;Yes, Judge,&quot; I would say. &quot;Of course I still love you.&quot; He&#x27;d kiss my cheek, and I would kiss his.

Former clerk Katherine Ku wrote that Kozinski expected to be able to approve the location of her apartment, would complain when his clerks &quot;wanted salad for lunch instead of whatever he was having,&quot; and &quot;regularly diminished women and their accomplishments.&quot;

Complaints about Kozinski&#x27;s abusive employment practices were raised as early as 1985 by former Kozinski employees. Those employees claimed Kozinski was unqualified to join the Ninth Circuit &quot;because of a harsh temperament, questionable decisions and misleading testimony before the Judiciary Committee.&quot; They said Kozinski was &quot;harsh, cruel, demeaning, sadistic, disingenuous and without compassion,&quot; and that his actions as a boss &quot;portray[ed] an unusual degree of hostility . . . and at times an almost complete disregard for the consequences of the actions upon individuals.&quot;

=== Timeline ===
On December 8, 2017, Kozinski was accused of misconduct by six women including former law clerks, legal externs, and junior staffers.

Kozinski responded to the allegations saying he did not remember showing any type of sexual material to his clerks and, &quot;If this is all they are able to dredge up after 35 years, I am not too worried.&quot; Kozinski officially issued a statement that read:

On December 14, the chief judge of the Ninth Circuit referred the matters for investigation and a day later assigned them to the 2nd Circuit. On December 15, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a story with allegations against Kozinski from 9 more women, this time with more prominent accusers including colleagues, law students, a professor and a former judge. The disclosed sexual misbehavior allegations span more than three decades, including allegations of unwanted physical touching and invitations by Kozinski to have sex. Four of the women say Kozinski touched or kissed them without permission. Three of the clerks who were working for him when the allegations broke resigned their positions.

On December 18, 2017, Kozinski announced his immediate retirement. It was unknown whether the investigation on Kozinski would continue. He stated during his resignation that the women must have misunderstood his &quot;broad sense of humor&quot; and &quot;candid way of speaking.&quot; Upon his retirement, many news sources characterized him as both a &quot;libertarian,&quot; and a writer of &quot;colorful&quot; opinions.

== Post-judicial career ==
On December 9, 2019, Kozinski argued before the Ninth Circuit for the first time since his resignation due to the scandal. Kozinski argued for a plaintiff suing over intellectual property.

Kozinski is representing former President Donald Trump in his lawsuit against Twitter on appeal in the Ninth Circuit.

== Personal life ==
Kozinski and his wife, attorney Marcy Jane Tiffany, were married soon after he graduated from law school. They have three sons.

As a judge, Kozinski would host a movie night called Kozinski&#x27;s Favorite Flicks.

In addition to being a former judge, Kozinski has been an essayist and a judicial commentator. Kozinski contributions to law journals have been used in graduate instruction at Georgetown University.

<text>The Sahara (, ) is a desert spanning across North Africa. With an area of , it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.

The name &quot;Sahara&quot; is derived from , a broken plural form of ( ), meaning &quot;desert&quot;.

The desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.

It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains. To the south it is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna around the Niger River valley and the Sudan region of sub-Saharan Africa. The Sahara can be divided into several regions, including the western Sahara, the central Ahaggar Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the Aïr Mountains, the Ténéré desert, and the Libyan Desert.

For several hundred thousand years, the Sahara has alternated between desert and savanna grassland in a 20,000-year cycle caused by the precession of Earth&#x27;s axis (about 26,000 years) as it rotates around the Sun, which changes the location of the North African monsoon.

==Geography==
The Sahara covers large parts of Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Western Sahara and Sudan, and parts of southern Morocco and Tunisia. It covers , 31% of the African continent. If all areas with a mean annual precipitation of less than were included, the Sahara would be . It is one of three distinct physiographic provinces of the African massive physiographic division. The Sahara is so large and bright that, in theory, it could be detected from other stars as a surface feature of Earth, with near-current technology.

The Sahara is mainly rocky hamada (stone plateaus); ergs (sand seas – large areas covered with sand dunes) form only a minor part, contrary to common misconception, but many of the sand dunes are over high. Wind or rare rainfall shape the desert features: sand dunes, dune fields, sand seas, stone plateaus, gravel plains (&quot;reg&quot;), dry valleys (&quot;wadi&quot;), dry lakes (&quot;oued&quot;), and salt flats (&quot;shatt&quot; or &quot;chott&quot;). Unusual landforms include the Richat Structure in Mauritania.

Several deeply dissected mountains, many volcanic, rise from the desert, including the Aïr Mountains, Ahaggar Mountains, Saharan Atlas, Tibesti Mountains, Adrar des Iforas, and the Red Sea Hills. The highest peak in the Sahara is Emi Koussi, a shield volcano in the Tibesti range of northern Chad.

The central Sahara is hyperarid, with sparse vegetation. The northern and southern reaches of the desert, along with the highlands, have areas of sparse grassland and desert shrub, with trees and taller shrubs in wadis, where moisture collects. In the central, hyperarid region, there are many subdivisions of the great desert: Tanezrouft, the Ténéré, the Libyan Desert, the Eastern Desert, the Nubian Desert and others. These extremely arid areas often receive no rain for years.

To the north, the Sahara skirts the Mediterranean Sea in Egypt and portions of Libya, but in Cyrenaica and the Maghreb, the Sahara borders the Mediterranean forest, woodland, and scrub eco-regions of northern Africa, all of which have a Mediterranean climate characterized by hot summers and cool and rainy winters. According to the botanical criteria of Frank White and geographer Robert Capot-Rey, the northern limit of the Sahara corresponds to the northern limit of date palm cultivation and the southern limit of the range of esparto, a grass typical of the Mediterranean climate portion of the Maghreb and Iberia. The northern limit also corresponds to the isohyet of annual precipitation.

To the south, the Sahara is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of dry tropical savanna with a summer rainy season that extends across Africa from east to west. The southern limit of the Sahara is indicated botanically by the southern limit of &quot;Cornulaca monacantha&quot; (a drought-tolerant member of the Chenopodiaceae), or northern limit of &quot;Cenchrus biflorus&quot;, a grass typical of the Sahel. According to climatic criteria, the southern limit of the Sahara corresponds to the isohyet of annual precipitation (this is a long-term average, since precipitation varies annually).

Important cities located in the Sahara include Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania; Tamanrasset, Ouargla, Béchar, Hassi Messaoud, Ghardaïa, and El Oued in Algeria; Timbuktu in Mali; Agadez in Niger; Ghat in Libya; and Faya-Largeau in Chad.

==Climate==

The Sahara is the world&#x27;s largest hot desert. It is located in the horse latitudes under the subtropical ridge, a significant belt of semi-permanent subtropical warm-core high pressure where the air from the upper troposphere usually descends, warming and drying the lower troposphere and preventing cloud formation.

The permanent absence of clouds allows unhindered light and thermal radiation. The stability of the atmosphere above the desert prevents any convective overturning, thus making rainfall virtually non-existent. As a consequence, the weather tends to be sunny, dry and stable with a minimal chance of rainfall. Subsiding, diverging, dry air masses associated with subtropical high-pressure systems are extremely unfavorable for the development of convectional showers. The subtropical ridge is the predominant factor that explains the hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) of this vast region. The descending airflow is the strongest and the most effective over the eastern part of the Great Desert, in the Libyan Desert: this is the sunniest, driest and the most nearly &quot;rainless&quot; place on the planet, rivaling the Atacama Desert, lying in Chile and Peru.

The rainfall inhibition and the dissipation of cloud cover are most accentuated over the eastern section of the Sahara rather than the western. The prevailing air mass lying above the Sahara is the continental tropical (cT) air mass, which is hot and dry. Hot, dry air masses primarily form over the North-African desert from the heating of the vast continental land area, and it affects the whole desert during most of the year. Because of this extreme heating process, a thermal low is usually noticed near the surface, and is the strongest and the most developed during the summertime. The Sahara High represents the eastern continental extension of the Azores High, centered over the North Atlantic Ocean. The subsidence of the Sahara High nearly reaches the ground during the coolest part of the year, while it is confined to the upper troposphere during the hottest periods.

The effects of local surface low pressure are extremely limited because upper-level subsidence still continues to block any form of air ascent. Also, to be protected against rain-bearing weather systems by the atmospheric circulation itself, the desert is made even drier by its geographical configuration and location. Indeed, the extreme aridity of the Sahara is not only explained by the subtropical high pressure: the Atlas Mountains of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia also help to enhance the aridity of the northern part of the desert. These major mountain ranges act as a barrier, causing a strong rain shadow effect on the leeward side by dropping much of the humidity brought by atmospheric disturbances along the polar front which affects the surrounding Mediterranean climates.

The primary source of rain in the Sahara is the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a continuous belt of low-pressure systems near the equator which bring the brief, short and irregular rainy season to the Sahel and southern Sahara. Rainfall in this giant desert has to overcome the physical and atmospheric barriers that normally prevent the production of precipitation. The harsh climate of the Sahara is characterized by: extremely low, unreliable, highly erratic rainfall; extremely high sunshine duration values; high temperatures year-round; negligible rates of relative humidity; a significant diurnal temperature variation; and extremely high levels of potential evaporation which are the highest recorded worldwide.

===Temperature===
The sky is usually clear above the desert, and the sunshine duration is extremely high everywhere in the Sahara. Most of the desert has more than 3,600 hours of bright sunshine per year (over 82% of daylight hours), and a wide area in the eastern part has over 4,000 hours of bright sunshine per year (over 91% of daylight hours). The highest values are very close to the theoretical maximum value. A value of 4300 hours (98%) of the time would be recorded in Upper Egypt (Aswan, Luxor) and in the Nubian Desert (Wadi Halfa). The annual average direct solar irradiation is around 2,800 kWh/(m2 year) in the Great Desert. The Sahara has a huge potential for solar energy production.

The high position of the Sun, the extremely low relative humidity, and the lack of vegetation and rainfall make the Great Desert the hottest large region in the world, and the hottest place on Earth during summer in some spots. The average high temperature exceeds during the hottest month nearly everywhere in the desert except at very high altitudes. The world&#x27;s highest officially recorded average daily high temperature was in a remote desert town in the Algerian Desert called Bou Bernous, at an elevation of above sea level, and only Death Valley, California rivals it.

Other hot spots in Algeria such as Adrar, Timimoun, In Salah, Ouallene, Aoulef, Reggane with an elevation between above sea level get slightly lower summer average highs, around during the hottest months of the year. Salah, well known in Algeria for its extreme heat, has average high temperatures of , , and in June, July, August and September respectively. There are even hotter spots in the Sahara, but they are located in extremely remote areas, especially in the Azalai, lying in northern Mali. The major part of the desert experiences around three to five months when the average high strictly exceeds ; while in the southern central part of the desert, there are up to six or seven months when the average high temperature strictly exceeds . Some examples of this are Bilma, Niger and Faya-Largeau, Chad. The annual average daily temperature exceeds everywhere and can approach in the hottest regions year-round. However, most of the desert has a value in excess of .

Sand and ground temperatures are even more extreme. During daytime, the sand temperature is extremely high: it can easily reach or more. A sand temperature of has been recorded in Port Sudan. Ground temperatures of have been recorded in the Adrar of Mauritania and a value of has been measured in Borkou, northern Chad.

Due to lack of cloud cover and very low humidity, the desert usually has high diurnal temperature variations between days and nights. However, it is a myth that the nights are especially cold after extremely hot days in the Sahara. On average, nighttime temperatures tend to be cooler than in the daytime. The smallest variations are found along the coastal regions due to high humidity and are often even lower than a difference, while the largest variations are found in inland desert areas where the humidity is the lowest, mainly in the southern Sahara. Still, it is true that winter nights can be cold, as it can drop to the freezing point and even below, especially in high-elevation areas. The frequency of subfreezing winter nights in the Sahara is strongly influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), with warmer winter temperatures during negative NAO events and cooler winters with more frosts when the NAO is positive. This is because the weaker clockwise flow around the eastern side of the subtropical anticyclone during negative NAO winters, although too dry to produce more than negligible precipitation, does reduce the flow of dry, cold air from higher latitudes of Eurasia into the Sahara significantly.

===Precipitation===
The average annual rainfall ranges from very low in the northern and southern fringes of the desert to nearly non-existent over the central and the eastern part. The thin northern fringe of the desert receives more winter cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of low pressure systems over the Mediterranean Sea along the polar front, although very attenuated by the rain shadow effects of the mountains and the annual average rainfall ranges from to . For example, Biskra, Algeria, and Ouarzazate, Morocco, are found in this zone. The southern fringe of the desert along the border with the Sahel receives summer cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of the Intertropical Convergence Zone from the south and the annual average rainfall ranges from to . For example, Timbuktu, Mali and Agadez, Niger are found in this zone.

The vast central hyper-arid core of the desert is virtually never affected by northerly or southerly atmospheric disturbances and permanently remains under the influence of the strongest anticyclonic weather regime, and the annual average rainfall can drop to less than . In fact, most of the Sahara receives less than . Of the of desert land in the Sahara, an area of about (about 31% of the total area) receives an annual average rainfall amount of or less, while some (about 17% of the total area) receives an average of or less.

The annual average rainfall is virtually zero over a wide area of some in the eastern Sahara comprising deserts of: Libya, Egypt and Sudan (Tazirbu, Kufra, Dakhla, Kharga, Farafra, Siwa, Asyut, Sohag, Luxor, Aswan, Abu Simbel, Wadi Halfa) where the long-term mean approximates per year. Rainfall is very unreliable and erratic in the Sahara as it may vary considerably year by year. In full contrast to the negligible annual rainfall amounts, the annual rates of potential evaporation are extraordinarily high, roughly ranging from per year to more than per year in the whole desert. Nowhere else on Earth has air been found as dry and evaporative as in the Sahara region. However, at least two instances of snowfall have been recorded in Sahara, in February 1979 and December 2016, both in the town of Ain Sefra.

===Desertification and prehistoric climate===
One theory for the formation of the Sahara is that the monsoon in Northern Africa was weakened because of glaciation during the Quaternary period, starting two or three million years ago. Another theory is that the monsoon was weakened when the ancient Tethys Sea dried up during the Tortonian period around 7 million years ago.

The climate of the Sahara has undergone enormous variations between wet and dry over the last few hundred thousand years, believed to be caused by long-term changes in the North African climate cycle that alters the path of the North African Monsoon – usually southward. The cycle is caused by a 41,000-year cycle in which the tilt of the earth changes between 22° and 24.5°. At present, it is in a dry period, but it is expected that the Sahara will become green again in 15,000 years. When the North African monsoon is at its strongest, annual precipitation and subsequent vegetation in the Sahara region increase, resulting in conditions commonly referred to as the &quot;green Sahara&quot;. For a relatively weak North African monsoon, the opposite is true, with decreased annual precipitation and less vegetation resulting in a phase of the Sahara climate cycle known as the &quot;desert Sahara&quot;.

The idea that changes in insolation (solar heating) caused by long-term changes in Earth&#x27;s orbit are a controlling factor for the long-term variations in the strength of monsoon patterns across the globe was first suggested by Rudolf Spitaler in the late nineteenth century, The hypothesis was later formally proposed and tested by the meteorologist John Kutzbach in 1981. Kutzbach&#x27;s ideas about the impacts of insolation on global monsoonal patterns have become widely accepted today as the underlying driver of long-term monsoonal cycles. Kutzbach never formally named his hypothesis and as such it is referred to here as the &quot;Orbital Monsoon Hypothesis&quot; as suggested by Ruddiman in 2001.
During the last glacial period, the Sahara was much larger than it is today, extending south beyond its current boundaries. The end of the glacial period brought more rain to the Sahara, from about 8000 BCE to 6000 BCE, perhaps because of low pressure areas over the collapsing ice sheets to the north. Once the ice sheets were gone, the northern Sahara dried out. In the southern Sahara, the drying trend was initially counteracted by the monsoon, which brought rain further north than it does today. By around 4200 BCE, however, the monsoon retreated south to approximately where it is today, leading to the gradual desertification of the Sahara. The Sahara is now as dry as it was about 13,000 years ago.

Lake Chad is the remnant of a former inland sea, paleolake Mega-Chad, which existed during the African humid period. At its largest extent, sometime before 5000 BCE, Lake Mega-Chad was the largest of four Saharan paleolakes, and is estimated to have covered an area of 350,000 km2.

The Sahara pump theory describes this cycle. During periods of a wet or &quot;Green Sahara&quot;, the Sahara becomes a savanna grassland and various flora and fauna become more common. Following inter-pluvial arid periods, the Sahara area then reverts to desert conditions and the flora and fauna are forced to retreat northwards to the Atlas Mountains, southwards into West Africa, or eastwards into the Nile Valley. This separates populations of some of the species in areas with different climates, forcing them to adapt, possibly giving rise to allopatric speciation.
It is also proposed that humans accelerated the drying-out period from 6000 to 2500 BCE by pastoralists overgrazing available grassland.

==== Evidence for cycles ====
The growth of speleothems (which requires rainwater) was detected in Hol-Zakh, Ashalim, Even-Sid, Ma&#x27;ale-ha-Meyshar, Ktora Cracks, Nagev Tzavoa Cave, and elsewhere, and has allowed tracking of prehistoric rainfall. The Red Sea coastal route was extremely arid before 140 and after 115 kya (thousands of years ago). Slightly wetter conditions appear at 90–87 kya, but it still was just one tenth the rainfall around 125 kya. In the southern Negev Desert speleothems did not grow between 185 and 140 kya (MIS 6), 110–90 (MIS 5.4–5.2), nor after 85 kya nor during most of the interglacial period (MIS 5.1), the glacial period and Holocene. This suggests that the southern Negev was arid-to-hyper-arid in these periods.

During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) the Sahara was more extensive than it is now with the extent of the tropical forests being greatly reduced, and the lower temperatures reduced the strength of the Hadley Cell. This is a climate cell which causes rising tropical air of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) to bring rain to the tropics, while dry descending air, at about 20 degrees north, flows back to the equator and brings desert conditions to this region. It is associated with high rates of wind-blown mineral dust, and these dust levels are found as expected in marine cores from the north tropical Atlantic. But around 12,500 BCE the amount of dust in the cores in the Bølling/Allerød phase suddenly plummets and shows a period of much wetter conditions in the Sahara, indicating a Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) event (a sudden warming followed by a slower cooling of the climate). The moister Saharan conditions had begun about 12,500 BCE, with the extension of the ITCZ northward in the northern hemisphere summer, bringing moist wet conditions and a savanna climate to the Sahara, which (apart from a short dry spell associated with the Younger Dryas) peaked during the Holocene thermal maximum climatic phase at 4000 BCE when mid-latitude temperatures seem to have been between 2 and 3 degrees warmer than in the recent past. Analysis of Nile River deposited sediments in the delta also shows this period had a higher proportion of sediments coming from the Blue Nile, suggesting higher rainfall also in the Ethiopian Highlands. This was caused principally by a stronger monsoonal circulation throughout the sub-tropical regions, affecting India, Arabia and the Sahara. Lake Victoria only recently became the source of the White Nile and dried out almost completely around 15 kya.

The sudden subsequent movement of the ITCZ southwards with a Heinrich event (a sudden cooling followed by a slower warming), linked to changes with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycle, led to a rapid drying out of the Saharan and Arabian regions, which quickly became desert. This is linked to a marked decline in the scale of the Nile floods between 2700 and 2100 BCE.

==Ecoregions==
The Sahara comprises several distinct ecoregions. With their variations in temperature, rainfall, elevation, and soil, these regions harbor distinct communities of plants and animals.

* The Atlantic coastal desert is a narrow strip along the Atlantic coast where fog generated offshore by the cool Canary Current provides sufficient moisture to sustain a variety of lichens, succulents, and shrubs. It covers an area of in the south of Morocco and Mauritania.
* The North Saharan steppe and woodlands is along the northern desert, next to the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregions of the northern Maghreb and Cyrenaica. Winter rains sustain shrublands and dry woodlands that form a transition between the Mediterranean climate regions to the north and the hyper-arid Sahara proper to the south. It covers in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia.
* The Sahara desert ecoregion covers the hyper-arid central portion of the Sahara where rainfall is minimal and sporadic. Vegetation is rare, and this ecoregion consists mostly of sand dunes (&quot;erg, chech, raoui&quot;), stone plateaus (&quot;hamadas&quot;), gravel plains (&quot;reg&quot;), dry valleys (&quot;wadis&quot;), and salt flats. It covers of: Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Sudan.
* The South Saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregion is a narrow band running east and west between the hyper-arid Sahara and the Sahel savannas to the south. Movements of the equatorial Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) bring summer rains during July and August which average but vary greatly from year to year. These rains sustain summer pastures of grasses and herbs, with dry woodlands and shrublands along seasonal watercourses. This ecoregion covers in Algeria, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Sudan.
* In the West Saharan montane xeric woodlands, several volcanic highlands provide a cooler, moister environment that supports Saharo-Mediterranean woodlands and shrublands. The ecoregion covers , mostly in the Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer of Algeria, with smaller enclaves in the Aïr of Niger, the Adrar Plateau of Mauritania, and the Adrar des Iforas of Mali and Algeria.
* The Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion consists of the Tibesti and Jebel Uweinat highlands. Higher and more regular rainfall and cooler temperatures support woodlands and shrublands of date palm, acacias, myrtle, oleander, tamarix, and several rare and endemic plants. The ecoregion covers in the Tibesti of Chad and Libya, and Jebel Uweinat on the border of Egypt, Libya, and Sudan.
* The Saharan halophytics is an area of seasonally flooded saline depressions which is home to halophytic (salt-adapted) plant communities. The Saharan halophytics cover including: the Qattara and Siwa depressions in northern Egypt, the Tunisian salt lakes of central Tunisia, Chott Melghir in Algeria, and smaller areas of Algeria, Mauritania, and the southern part of Morocco.
* The Tanezrouft is one of the Sahara&#x27;s most arid regions, with no vegetation and very little life. A barren, flat gravel plain, it extends south of Reggane in Algeria towards the Adrar des Ifoghas highlands in northern Mali.

==Flora and fauna==
The flora of the Sahara is highly diversified based on the bio-geographical characteristics of this vast desert. Floristically, the Sahara has three zones based on the amount of rainfall received – the Northern (Mediterranean), Central and Southern Zones. There are two transitional zones – the Mediterranean-Sahara transition and the Sahel transition zone.

The Saharan flora comprises around 2800 species of vascular plants. Approximately a quarter of these are endemic. About half of these species are common to the flora of the Arabian deserts.
The central Sahara is estimated to include five hundred species of plants, which is extremely low considering the huge extent of the area. Plants such as acacia trees, palms, succulents, spiny shrubs, and grasses have adapted to the arid conditions, by growing lower to avoid water loss by strong winds, by storing water in their thick stems to use it in dry periods, by having long roots that travel horizontally to reach the maximum area of water and to find any surface moisture, and by having small thick leaves or needles to prevent water loss by evapotranspiration. Plant leaves may dry out totally and then recover.

Several species of fox live in the Sahara including: the fennec fox, pale fox and Rüppell&#x27;s fox. The addax, a large white antelope, can go nearly a year in the desert without drinking. The dorcas gazelle is a north African gazelle that can also go for a long time without water. Other notable gazelles include the rhim gazelle and dama gazelle.

The Saharan cheetah (northwest African cheetah) lives in Algeria, Togo, Niger, Mali, Benin, and Burkina Faso. There remain fewer than 250 mature cheetahs, which are very cautious, fleeing any human presence. The cheetah avoids the sun from April to October, seeking the shelter of shrubs such as balanites and acacias. They are unusually pale. The other cheetah subspecies (northeast African cheetah) lives in Chad, Sudan and the eastern region of Niger. However, it is currently extinct in the wild in Egypt and Libya. There are approximately 2000 mature individuals left in the wild.
Other animals include the monitor lizards, hyrax, sand vipers, and small populations of African wild dog, in perhaps only 14 countries and red-necked ostrich. Other animals exist in the Sahara (birds in particular) such as African silverbill and black-faced firefinch, among others. There are also small desert crocodiles in Mauritania and the Ennedi Plateau of Chad.

The deathstalker scorpion can be long. Its venom contains large amounts of agitoxin and scyllatoxin and is very dangerous; however, a sting from this scorpion rarely kills a healthy adult. The Saharan silver ant is unique in that due to the extreme high temperatures of their habitat, and the threat of predators, the ants are active outside their nest for only about ten minutes per day.

Dromedary camels and goats are the domesticated animals most commonly found in the Sahara. Because of its qualities of endurance and speed, the dromedary is the favourite animal used by nomads.

Human activities are more likely to affect the habitat in areas of permanent water (oases) or where water comes close to the surface. Here, the local pressure on natural resources can be intense. The remaining populations of large mammals have been greatly reduced by hunting for food and recreation. In recent years development projects have started in the deserts of Algeria and Tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers. These schemes often lead to soil degradation and salinization.

Researchers from Hacettepe University have reported that Saharan soil may have bio-available iron and also some essential macro and micro nutrient elements suitable for use as fertilizer for growing wheat.

== History ==

People lived on the edge of the desert thousands of years ago, since the end of the last glacial period. In the Central Sahara, engraved and painted rock art were created perhaps as early as 10,000 years ago, spanning the Bubaline Period, Kel Essuf Period, Round Head Period, Pastoral Period, Caballine Period, and Cameline Period. The Sahara was then a much wetter place than it is today. Over 30,000 petroglyphs of river animals such as crocodiles survive, with half found in the Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer in southeast Algeria. Fossils of dinosaurs, including &quot;Afrovenator&quot;, &quot;Jobaria&quot; and &quot;Ouranosaurus&quot;, have also been found here. The modern Sahara, though, is not lush in vegetation, except in the Nile Valley, at a few oases, and in the northern highlands, where Mediterranean plants such as the olive tree are found to grow. Shifts in Earth&#x27;s axis increased temperatures and decreased precipitation, which caused an abrupt beginning of North Africa desertification about 5,400 years ago.

===Kiffians===
The Kiffian culture is a prehistoric industry, or domain, that existed between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago in the Sahara, during the Neolithic Subpluvial. Human remains from this culture were found in 2000 at a site known as Gobero, located in Niger in the Ténéré Desert. The site is known as the largest and earliest grave of Stone Age people in the Sahara. The Kiffians were skilled hunters. Bones of many large savannah animals that were discovered in the same area suggest that they lived on the shores of a lake that was present during the Holocene Wet Phase, a period when the Sahara was verdant and wet. The Kiffian people were tall, standing over six feet in height. Craniometric analysis indicates that this early Holocene population was closely related to the Late Pleistocene Iberomaurusians and early Holocene Capsians of the Maghreb, as well as mid-Holocene Mechta groups. Traces of the Kiffian culture do not exist after 8,000 years ago, as the Sahara went through a dry period for the next thousand years. After this time, the Tenerian culture colonized the area.

===Tenerians===
Gobero was discovered in 2000 during an archaeological expedition led by Paul Sereno, which sought dinosaur remains. Two distinct prehistoric cultures were discovered at the site: the early Holocene Kiffian culture, and the middle Holocene Tenerian culture. The post-Kiffian desiccation lasted until around 4600 BCE, when the earliest artefacts associated with the Tenerians have been dated to. Some 200 skeletons have been discovered at Gobero. The Tenerians were considerably shorter in height and less robust than the earlier Kiffians. Craniometric analysis also indicates that they were osteologically distinct. The Kiffian skulls are akin to those of the Late Pleistocene Iberomaurusians, early Holocene Capsians, and mid-Holocene Mechta groups, whereas the Tenerian crania are more like those of Mediterranean groups. Graves show that the Tenerians observed spiritual traditions, as they were buried with artifacts such as jewelry made of hippo tusks and clay pots. The most interesting find is a triple burial, dated to 5300 years ago, of an adult female and two children, estimated through their teeth as being five and eight years old, hugging each other. Pollen residue indicates they were buried on a bed of flowers. The three are assumed to have died within 24 hours of each other, but as their skeletons hold no apparent trauma (they did not die violently) and they have been buried so elaborately – unlikely if they had died of a plague – the cause of their deaths is a mystery.
===Tashwinat Mummy===
Uan Muhuggiag appears to have been inhabited from at least the 6th millennium BCE to about 2700 BCE, although not necessarily continuously. The most noteworthy find at Uan Muhuggiag is the well-preserved mummy of a young boy of approximately years old. The child was in a fetal position, then embalmed, then placed in a sack made of antelope skin, which was insulated by a layer of leaves. The boy&#x27;s organs were removed, as evidenced by incisions in his stomach and thorax, and an organic preservative was inserted to stop his body from decomposing. An ostrich eggshell necklace was also found around his neck. Radiocarbon dating determined the age of the mummy to be approximately 5600 years old, which makes it about 1000 years older than the earliest previously recorded mummy in ancient Egypt. In 1958–59, an archaeological expedition led by Antonio Ascenzi conducted anthropological, radiological, histological and chemical analyses on the Uan Muhuggiag mummy. The team claimed that the mummy was a 30-month-old child of uncertain sex. They also found a long incision on the specimen&#x27;s abdominal wall, which indicated that the body had been initially mummified by evisceration and later underwent natural desiccation. The team also stated that the mummy possessed &quot;Negroid features.&quot; However, modern genetics has since proven that the final claim is unscientific and not supported by evidence. A more recent publication referenced a laboratory examination of the cutaneous features of the child mummy in which the results verified that the child possessed a dark skin complexion. One other individual, an adult, was found at Uan Muhuggiag, buried in a crouched position. However, the body showed no evidence of evisceration or any other method of preservation. The body was estimated to date from about 7500 BP.

===Nubians===
During the Neolithic Era, before the onset of desertification around 9500 BCE, the central Sudan had been a rich environment supporting a large population ranging across what is now barren desert, like the Wadi el-Qa&#x27;ab. By the 5th millennium BCE, the people who inhabited what is now called Nubia were full participants in the &quot;agricultural revolution&quot;, living a settled lifestyle with domesticated plants and animals. Saharan rock art of cattle and herdsmen suggests the presence of a cattle cult like those found in Sudan and other pastoral societies in Africa today. Megaliths found at Nabta Playa are overt examples of probably the world&#x27;s first known archaeoastronomy devices, predating Stonehenge by some 2,000 years. This complexity, as observed at Nabta Playa, and as expressed by different levels of authority within the society there, likely formed the basis for the structure of both the Neolithic society at Nabta and the Old Kingdom of Egypt.
Archaeological evidence has attested that population settlements occurred in Nubia as early as the Late Pleistocene era and from the 5th millennium BCE onwards, whereas there is &quot;no or scanty evidence&quot; of human presence in the Egyptian Nile Valley during these periods, which may be due to problems in site preservation.

===Egyptians===
By 6000 BCE predynastic Egyptians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were herding cattle and constructing large buildings. Subsistence in organized and permanent settlements in predynastic Egypt by the middle of the 6th millennium BCE centered predominantly on cereal and animal agriculture: cattle, goats, pigs and sheep. Metal objects replaced prior ones of stone. Tanning of animal skins, pottery and weaving were commonplace in this era also. There are indications of seasonal or only temporary occupation of the Al Fayyum in the 6th millennium BCE, with food activities centering on fishing, hunting and food-gathering. Stone arrowheads, knives and scrapers from the era are commonly found. Burial items included pottery, jewelry, farming and hunting equipment, and assorted foods including dried meat and fruit. Burial in desert environments appears to enhance Egyptian preservation rites, and the dead were buried facing due west. Several scholars have argued that the African origins of the Egyptian civilisation derived from pastoral communities which emerged in both the Egyptian and Sudanese regions of the Nile Valley in the fifth millennium BCE.

By 3400 BCE, the Sahara was as dry as it is today, due to reduced precipitation and higher temperatures resulting from a shift in Earth&#x27;s orbit. As a result of this aridification, it became a largely impenetrable barrier to humans, with the remaining settlements mainly being concentrated around the numerous oases that dot the landscape. Little trade or commerce is known to have passed through the interior in subsequent periods, the only major exception being the Nile Valley. The Nile, however, was impassable at several cataracts, making trade and contact by boat difficult.

===Tichitt culture===

In 4000 BCE, the start of sophisticated social structure (e.g., trade of cattle as valued assets) developed among herders amid the Pastoral Period of the Sahara. Saharan pastoral culture (e.g., fields of tumuli, lustrous stone rings, axes) was intricate. By 1800 BCE, Saharan pastoral culture expanded throughout the Saharan and Sahelian regions. The initial stages of sophisticated social structure among Saharan herders served as the segue for the development of sophisticated hierarchies found in African settlements, such as Dhar Tichitt. After migrating from the Central Sahara, proto-Mande peoples established their civilization in the Tichitt region of the Western Sahara The Tichitt Tradition of eastern Mauritania dates from 2200 BCE to 200 BCE. Tichitt culture, at Dhar Néma, Dhar Tagant, Dhar Tichitt, and Dhar Walata, included a four-tiered hierarchal social structure, farming of cereals, metallurgy, numerous funerary tombs, and a rock art tradition At Dhar Tichitt and Dhar Walata, pearl millet may have also been independently tamed amid the Neolithic. Dhar Tichitt, which includes Dakhlet el Atrouss, may have served as the primary regional center for the multi-tiered hierarchical social structure of the Tichitt Tradition, and the Malian Lakes Region, which includes Tondidarou, may have served as a second regional center of the Tichitt Tradition. The urban Tichitt Tradition may have been the earliest large-scale, complexly organized society in West Africa, and an early civilization of the Sahara, which may have served as the segue for state formation in West Africa.

As areas where the Tichitt cultural tradition were present, Dhar Tichitt and Dhar Walata were occupied more frequently than Dhar Néma. Farming of crops (e.g., millet) may have been a feature of the Tichitt cultural tradition as early as 3rd millennium BCE in Dhar Tichitt.

As part of a broader trend of iron metallurgy developed in the West African Sahel amid 1st millennium BCE, iron items (350 BCE – 100 CE) were found at Dhar Tagant, iron metalworking and/or items (800 BCE – 400 BCE) were found at Dia Shoma and Walaldé, and the iron remnants (760 BCE – 400 BCE) found at Bou Khzama and Djiganyai. The iron materials that were found are evidence of iron metalworking at Dhar Tagant. In the late period of the Tichitt Tradition at Dhar Néma, tamed pearl millet was used to temper the tuyeres of an oval-shaped low shaft furnace; this furnace was one out of 16 iron furnaces located on elevated ground. Iron metallurgy may have developed before the second half of 1st millennium BCE, as indicated by pottery dated between 800 BCE and 200 BCE. At Dhar Walata and Dhar Tichitt, copper was also used.

After its decline in Mauritania, the Tichitt Tradition spread to the Middle Niger region (e.g., Méma, Macina, Dia Shoma, Jenne Jeno) of Mali where it developed into and persisted as Faïta Facies ceramics between 1300 BCE and 400 BCE among rammed earth architecture and iron metallurgy (which had developed after 900 BCE). Thereafter, the Ghana Empire developed in the 1st millennium CE.

===Phoenicians===

The people of Phoenicia, who flourished from 1200 to 800 BCE, created a chain of settlements along the coast of North Africa and traded extensively with its inhabitants. This put them in contact with the people of ancient Libya, who were the ancestors of people who speak Berber languages in North Africa and the Sahara today.

The Libyco-Berber alphabet of the ancient Libyans of north Africa seems to have been based on Phoenician, and its descendant Tifinagh is still used today by the (Berber) Tuareg of the central Sahara.

The Periplus of the Phoenician navigator Hanno, who lived sometime in the 5th century BCE, claims that he founded settlements along the Atlantic coast of Africa, possibly including the Western Sahara. The identification of the places discussed is controversial, and archeological confirmation is lacking.

===Greeks===
By 500 BCE, Greeks arrived in the desert. Greek traders spread along the eastern coast of the desert, establishing trading colonies along the Red Sea. The Carthaginians explored the Atlantic coast of the desert, but the turbulence of the waters and the lack of markets caused a lack of presence further south than modern Morocco. Centralized states thus surrounded the desert on the north and east; it remained outside the control of these states. Raids from the nomadic Berber people of the desert were of constant concern to those living on the edge of the desert.

===Garamantes===
An urban civilization, the Garamantes, arose around 500 BCE in the Sahara, in a valley that is now called the Wadi al-Ajal in Fezzan, Libya. The Garamantes built a prosperous empire in the heart of the desert. The Garamantes achieved this development by digging tunnels far into the mountains flanking the valley to tap fossil water and bring it to their fields. The Garamantes grew populous and strong, conquering their neighbors, and capturing and enslaving many individuals who were forced to work by extending the tunnels. The ancient Greeks and the Romans knew of the Garamantes and regarded them as uncivilized nomads. However, they traded with them, and a Roman bath has been found in the Garamantes&#x27; capital of Garama. Archaeologists have found eight major towns and many other important settlements in the Garamantes&#x27; territory. The Garamantes&#x27; civilization eventually collapsed after they had depleted available water in the aquifers and could no longer sustain the effort to extend the tunnels further into the mountains.

Between the first century BCE and the fourth century CE, several Roman expeditions into the Sahara were conducted by groups of military and commercial units of Romans.

===Islamic and Arabic expansion===

The Byzantine Empire ruled the northern shores of the Sahara from the 5th to the 7th centuries. After the Muslim conquest of Arabia, specifically the Arabian peninsula, the Muslim conquest of North Africa began in the mid-7th to early 8th centuries and Islamic influence expanded rapidly on the Sahara. By the end of 641 all of Egypt was in Muslim hands. Trade across the desert intensified, and a significant slave trade crossed the desert. It has been estimated that from the 10th to 19th centuries some 6,000 to 7,000 slaves were transported north each year.

The Beni Ḥassān and other nomadic Arab tribes dominated the Sanhaja Berber tribes of the western Sahara after the Char Bouba war of the 17th century. As a result, Arabian culture and language came to dominate, and the Berber tribes underwent some Arabization.

===Ottoman Turkish era===
In the 16th century the northern fringe of the Sahara, such as coastal regencies in present-day Algeria and Tunisia, as well as some parts of present-day Libya, together with the semi-autonomous kingdom of Egypt, were occupied by the Ottoman Empire. From 1517 Egypt was a valued part of the Ottoman Empire, ownership of which provided the Ottomans with control over the Nile Valley, the east Mediterranean and North Africa. The benefit of the Ottoman Empire was the freedom of movement for citizens and goods. Traders exploited the Ottoman land routes to handle the spices, gold and silk from the East, manufactured goods from Europe, and the slave and gold traffic from Africa. Arabic continued as the local language and Islamic culture was much reinforced. The Sahel and southern Sahara regions were home to several independent states or to roaming Tuareg clans.

===European colonialism===
European colonialism in the Sahara began in the 19th century. France conquered the regency of Algiers from the Ottomans in 1830, and French rule spread south from French Algeria and eastwards from Senegal into the upper Niger to include present-day Algeria, Chad, Mali then French Sudan including Timbuktu (1893), Mauritania, Morocco (1912), Niger, and Tunisia (1881). By the beginning of the 20th century, the trans-Saharan trade had clearly declined because goods were moved through more modern and efficient means, such as airplanes, rather than across the desert.

The French took advantage of long-standing animosity between the Chaamba Arabs and the Tuareg. The newly raised &quot;Méhariste&quot; camel corps were originally recruited mainly from the Chaamba nomadic tribe. In 1902, the French penetrated the Hoggar Mountains and defeated Ahaggar Tuareg in the battle of Tit.

The French Colonial Empire was the dominant presence in the Sahara. It established regular air links from Toulouse (HQ of famed Aéropostale), to Oran and over the Hoggar to Timbuktu and West to Bamako and Dakar, as well as trans-Sahara bus services run by La Compagnie Transsaharienne (est. 1927). A remarkable film shot by famous aviator Captain René Wauthier in 1933 documents the first crossing by a large truck convoy from Algiers to Tchad, across the Sahara.

Egypt, under Muhammad Ali and his successors, conquered Nubia in 1820–22, founded Khartoum in 1823, and conquered Darfur in 1874. Egypt, including Sudan, became a British protectorate in 1882. Egypt and Britain lost control of the Sudan from 1882 to 1898 as a result of the Mahdist War. After its capture by British troops in 1898, the Sudan became an Anglo-Egyptian condominium.

Spain captured present-day Western Sahara after 1874, although Rio del Oro remained largely under Sahrawi influence. In 1912, Italy captured parts of what was to be named Libya from the Ottomans. To promote the Roman Catholic religion in the desert, Pope Pius IX appointed a delegate Apostolic of the Sahara and the Sudan in 1868; later in the 19th century his jurisdiction was reorganized into the Vicariate Apostolic of Sahara.

===Breakup of the empires and afterwards===

Egypt became independent of Britain in 1936, although the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 allowed Britain to keep troops in Egypt and to maintain the British-Egyptian condominium in the Sudan. British military forces were withdrawn in 1954.

Most of the Saharan states achieved independence after World War II: Libya in 1951; Morocco, Sudan, and Tunisia in 1956; Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger in 1960; and Algeria in 1962. Spain withdrew from Western Sahara in 1975, and it was partitioned between Mauritania and Morocco. Mauritania withdrew in 1979; Morocco continues to hold the territory (see Western Sahara conflict).

Tuareg people in Mali rebelled several times during the 20th century before finally forcing the Malian armed forces to withdraw below the line demarcating Azawad from southern Mali during the 2012 rebellion. Islamist rebels in the Sahara calling themselves al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb have stepped up their violence in recent years.

In the post–World War II era, several mines and communities have developed to use the desert&#x27;s natural resources. These include large deposits of oil and natural gas in Algeria and Libya, and large deposits of phosphates in Morocco and Western Sahara. Libya&#x27;s Great Man-Made River is the world&#x27;s largest irrigation project. The project uses a pipeline system that pumps fossil water from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System to cities in the populous Libyan northern Mediterranean coast including Tripoli and Benghazi.

A number of Trans-African highways have been proposed across the Sahara, including the Cairo–Dakar Highway along the Atlantic coast, the Trans-Sahara Highway from Algiers on the Mediterranean to Kano in Nigeria, the Tripoli – Cape Town Highway from Tripoli in Libya to N&#x27;Djamena in Chad, and the Cairo – Cape Town Highway which follows the Nile. Each of these highways is partially complete, with significant gaps and unpaved sections.

==Peoples and languages==

The people of the Sahara are of various origins. Among them the Amazigh including the Tuareg, various Arabized Amaziɣ groups such as the Hassaniya-speaking Sahrawis, whose populations include the Znaga, a tribe whose name is a remnant of the pre-historic Zenaga language. Other major groups of people include the: Toubou, Nubians, Zaghawa, Kanuri, Hausa, Songhai, Beja, and Fula/Fulani (; ). The archaeological evidence from the Holocene period has shown that Nilo-Saharan speaking groups had populated the central and southern Sahara before the influx of Berber and Arabic speakers, around 1500 years ago, who now largely populate the Sahara in the modern era.

Arabic dialects are the most widely spoken languages in the Sahara. Arabic, Berber and its variants now regrouped under the term Amazigh (which includes the Guanche language spoken by the original Berber inhabitants of the Canary Islands) and Beja languages are part of the Afro-Asiatic or Hamito-Semitic family. Unlike neighboring West Africa and the central governments of the states that comprise the Sahara, the French language bears little relevance to inter-personal discourse and commerce within the region, its people retaining staunch ethnic and political affiliations with Tuareg and Berber leaders and culture. The legacy of the French colonial era administration is primarily manifested in the territorial reorganization enacted by the Third and Fourth republics, which engendered artificial political divisions within a hitherto isolated and porous region. Diplomacy with local clients was conducted primarily in Arabic, which was the traditional language of bureaucratic affairs. Mediation of disputes and inter-agency communication was served by interpreters contracted by the French government, who, according to Keenan, &quot;documented a space of intercultural mediation,&quot; contributing much to preserving the indigenous cultural identities in the region.

<text>Stax Records is an American record company, originally based in Memphis, Tennessee. Founded in 1957 as Satellite Records, the label changed its name to Stax Records in September 1961. It also shared its operations with sister label Volt Records.

Stax was influential in the creation of Southern soul and Memphis soul music. Stax also released gospel, funk, and blues recordings. Renowned for its output of blues music, the label was founded by two siblings and business partners, Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton (STewart/AXton = Stax). It featured several popular ethnically integrated bands (including the label&#x27;s house band, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s) and a racially integrated team of staff and artists unprecedented in that time of racial strife and tension in Memphis and the South. According to ethnomusicologist Rob Bowman, the label&#x27;s use of &quot;one studio, one equipment set-up, the same set of musicians and a small group of songwriters led to a readily identifiable sound. It was a sound based in black gospel, blues, country, and earlier forms of rhythm and blues (R&amp;B). It became known as southern soul music.&quot;

Following the death of Stax&#x27;s biggest star, Otis Redding, in 1967, and the severance of the label&#x27;s distribution deal with Atlantic Records in 1968, Stax continued primarily under the supervision of a new co-owner, Al Bell. Over the next five years, Bell expanded the label&#x27;s operations significantly, in order to compete with Stax&#x27;s main rival, Motown Records in Detroit. During the mid-1970s, a number of factors, including a problematic distribution deal with CBS Records, caused the label to slide into insolvency, resulting in its forced closure in late 1975.

In 1977, Fantasy Records acquired the post-1968 Stax catalogue and selected pre-1968 recordings. Beginning in 1978, Stax (now owned by Fantasy) began signing new acts and issuing new material, as well as reissuing previously recorded Stax material. However, by the early 1980s, no new material was being issued on the label, and for the next two decades, Stax was strictly a reissue label.

After Concord Records acquired Fantasy in 2004, the Stax label was reactivated, and is today used to issue both the 1968–1975 catalog material and new recordings by current R&amp;B and soul performers. Atlantic Records continues to hold the rights to the vast majority of the 1959–1968 Stax material.

==History==

===1957–1960: early years as Satellite Records===
Stax Records, originally named Satellite Records, was founded in Memphis in 1957 by Jim Stewart, initially operating in a garage. Satellite&#x27;s early releases were country music, rockabilly records or straight pop numbers, reflecting the tastes of Stewart (a country fiddle player) at the time.

In 1958, Stewart&#x27;s sister Estelle Axton began her financial interest in the company. Taking a considerable financial risk, she mortgaged her family home to invest (US$ in dollars) in the company, enabling Satellite to purchase an Ampex 350 mono console tape recorder.

The company set up a small recording studio in a converted garage near National Cemetery in Brunswick, Tennessee, in 1959. In 1970, Stewart recalled this portion of the label&#x27;s origins, and remarked, &quot;I don&#x27;t even remember the address. We didn&#x27;t have any sound equipment or anything else but a small building and a lot of desire.&quot;

Around this time, Stewart was introduced to rhythm and blues music by staff producer Chips Moman. In the summer of that year, Satellite released its first record by a rhythm and blues act, &quot;Fool in Love&quot;, by the Veltones, which was soon picked up for national distribution by Mercury Records. However, Satellite remained primarily a country and pop label for the next year or so.

While promoting &quot;Fool in Love&quot;, Stewart met with Memphis disc jockey and R&amp;B singer Rufus Thomas, and both parties were impressed by the other. Around the same time, and at the urging of Chips Moman, Stewart moved the company back to Memphis and into an old movie theater, the former Capitol Theatre, at 926 East McLemore Avenue in South Memphis; Stewart recalled that he chose the building because &quot;it was in the area close to where Rufus Thomas (WDIA Radio disk jockey) lived [alongside] several of the other musicians and writers that are still working with the studio today. They drifted in and we got locked in on the rhythm and blues field.&quot; In the summer of 1960, Rufus Thomas and his daughter Carla were the first artists to make a recording in this new facility; the record, &quot;Cause I Love You&quot; (credited to Rufus &amp; Carla), became a substantial regional hit and was picked up for national distribution by Atlantic Records on its Atco subsidiary. It went on to sell between thirty and forty thousand copies, becoming Satellite&#x27;s biggest hit to that time.

===1961: name change to Stax and beginning of partnership with Atlantic===
With the success of &quot;Cause I Love You&quot;, Stewart made a distribution deal giving Atlantic first choice on releasing Satellite recordings. From this point on, Stewart focused more and more on recording and promoting rhythm and blues acts. Not having really known anything about the R&amp;B genre prior to having recorded acts such as the Veltones and Rufus &amp; Carla, Stewart likened the situation to that of &quot;a blind man who suddenly gained his sight.&quot; From 1961 on, virtually all of the output of Satellite Records (and its successor labels Stax and Volt) would be in the R&amp;B/southern soul style.

As part of the deal with Atlantic, Satellite agreed to continue recording Carla Thomas but allowed her recordings to be released on the Atlantic label. Her first hit, &quot;Gee Whiz&quot;, was originally issued as Satellite 104, but it was quickly reissued as Atlantic 2086, becoming a hit in early 1961. Her recordings would continue to be issued on Atlantic through mid-1965, though much of her work was recorded in the studios at Satellite (later Stax) or in Nashville under the supervision of the Stax staff.

In June 1961, Satellite signed a local instrumental band, the Royal Spades. Changing their name to the Mar-Keys, the band recorded and issued the single &quot;Last Night&quot;, which shot to #3 on the US pop charts and #2 on the R&amp;B charts.

&quot;Last Night&quot; was the first single to be nationally distributed on the Satellite label; previous Atlantic issues of Satellite material were issued nationally on the Atlantic or Atco label. This led to a complaint from another company named Satellite Records, which had been in operation in California for some years but was previously unaware of the Memphis-based Satellite label. Accordingly, in September 1961, Satellite permanently changed its name to &quot;Stax Records&quot;, a portmanteau of the names of the two owners of the company: Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton.

===1962–1964: Stax and Volt in ascendancy===
By 1962, the pieces were in place that allowed Stax to turn from a successful regional label into (alongside Motown and Atlantic) a national R&amp;B powerhouse. Throughout the rest of the 1960s, the label&#x27;s operations would be greatly aided by several unique factors, including the label&#x27;s record store, studio, artist and repertoire (A&amp;R) department and house band, which regularly voted with Stewart on which records would be issued on the label.

====Record store====
While Stewart ran the recording studio where the auditorium had been, Axton ran the Satellite record shop, which she established in the cinema&#x27;s old foyer, where the refreshment stand had been. (The store later expanded next door into a vacated barber shop.) The Satellite store sold records from a wide variety of labels, which gave the Stax staff first-hand knowledge of what kind of music was selling—and was subsequently reflected in the music that Stax recorded. The store quickly became a popular hangout for local teenagers and was used to test-market potential Stax singles, as acetates of recently recorded Stax music were played to gauge customers&#x27; reactions. It also provided regular employment for many of the young hopefuls who later became part of Stax&#x27;s musical family and provided cash flow in the early years while the label was struggling to establish itself. In his 2013 book &quot;Respect Yourself: Stax Records and the Soul Explosion&quot;, Robert Gordon highlighted the importance of Estelle Axton to the company. Often addressed as &quot;Miz Axton&quot; or &quot;Lady A.&quot;, she was respected by the Stax staff and performers and was regarded as a mother figure in the company. Although she had no formal training or experience in marketing, she had an unerring instinct for music and made many valuable suggestions to the young writers and musicians. Booker T. Jones described Estelle as &quot;an inspirer&quot;:

====A&amp;R====
Original A&amp;R director Chips Moman left the company at the end of 1961 after a royalty dispute with Stewart; he soon opened his own studio across town. Mar-Keys member Steve Cropper replaced Moman as Stewart&#x27;s assistant and A&amp;R director. Cropper would quickly become a writer, producer and session guitarist on scores of Stax singles.

====House band====
In the first few years at Stax, the house band varied, although Cropper, bassist Lewie Steinberg, drummers Howard Grimes or Curtis Green, and horn players Floyd Newman, Gene &quot;Bowlegs&quot; Miller, and Gilbert Caple were relative constants.

By 1962, multi-instrumentalist Booker T. Jones was also a regular session musician at Stax (he was primarily a pianist and organist, but he played sax on &quot;Cause I Love You&quot;), as was bassist Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn. Jones, Steinberg and Cropper were joined in mid-1962 by drummer Al Jackson Jr. to form Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, an instrumental combo that would record numerous hit singles in their own right and served as the &quot;de facto&quot; house band for virtually every recording made at Stax from 1962 through about 1970. Dunn eventually became the band&#x27;s primary bassist, replacing Steinberg in 1964. Jones was frequently absent from Stax over several years in the mid-1960s, while he pursued his musical studies at Indiana University, so during this period Isaac Hayes usually replaced him as the house band&#x27;s regular pianist, although the two occasionally performed on recordings together when Jones was back in Memphis.

Other members of the house band included horn players Andrew Love, Joe Arnold, and Wayne Jackson. Hayes had auditioned for Stax in 1962, unsuccessfully, but by 1964 he became a vital part of the Stax house band, along with his songwriting partner, David Porter. Cropper, Dunn, Hayes, Jackson, Jones and Porter were collectively known as the &quot;Big Six&quot; within the walls of Stax and were (either as a group or in various combinations) responsible for producing almost all of the label&#x27;s output from about 1963 through 1969.

The Stax house band&#x27;s working methods were unusual for popular music recording at the time, and it was this that attracted the interest of Atlantic Records&#x27; Jerry Wexler. For most major recording companies at the time, the standard practice was for the label&#x27;s staff producer or A&amp;R manager to hire a studio, an arranger and the session musicians who were to back the featured vocalist or instrumentalist, and the arranger would write sheet music arrangements for the musicians to work from. Such unionised sessions were run strictly &quot;by the clock&quot; and there was a strict demarcation between the studio and the control room. By contrast, the Stax sessions ran as long as was needed, the musicians moved freely between the control room and the studio floor, and all were free to make suggestions and contributions as they worked up what are known as head arrangements, in which none of the musicians&#x27; parts were written down and nothing was worked out in advance.

Stax&#x27;s unusual working methods first came to Wexler&#x27;s attention in the fall of 1963. He was expecting a new single from Carla Thomas, but when he contacted Stax he was told that they had been unable to record for two weeks because of faults in the recording equipment, so he immediately flew Atlantic&#x27;s highly skilled house engineer Tom Dowd down to Memphis that Friday. Dowd had the equipment fixed within two days, and on the Sunday he was able to act as engineer during the creation of a new Rufus Thomas track. He was amazed by the loose, improvisational feel of the session and by the way Thomas and the musicians developed and recorded the song: Thomas simply sang through the new number for the band once or twice, humming suggestions for their parts and sounding the rhythm by clacking his teeth close to their ears. Once the new head arrangement was established, Dowd started recording, and Thomas and the band nailed the song in just two takes. When Dowd returned to New York the next day he had the tape of Thomas&#x27; breakthrough hit &quot;Walking the Dog&quot;, which Jim Stewart lauded as the best-sounding record Stax had yet produced. Wexler later commented:

==== Stax studio====
Another important factor in Stax&#x27;s success was the studio itself. The recording studio, located at 926 E McLemore Ave in Memphis, was a converted movie theater, which still had the sloped floor where the seats had once been. Because the room was imbalanced, it created an acoustic anomaly that was audible on recordings, often giving them a big, deep yet raw sound. Soul music historian Rob Bowman notes that because of the distinctive sound, soul music fans can tell often within the first few notes if a song was recorded at Stax. When Tom Dowd first arrived at Stax in 1963 the studio was still using the veteran Ampex mono recorder it had purchased in the late Fifties. Dowd immediately suggested that a two-track recorder should be installed. The Stax team were appalled at the idea, fearing that the distinctive &quot;Stax sound&quot; would be destroyed. However, Dowd pointed out that stereo albums sold for a higher price, which would mean more income for Stax, so in the summer of 1965 he installed an additional two-track recorder, allowing Stax to record sessions simultaneously in mono and stereo, and in 1966 he upgraded the studio further with a four-track recorder.

====Early successes====
The label&#x27;s biggest early star, soul singer Otis Redding, also arrived in 1962. Redding, however, technically was not on Stax, but on its sister label Volt. In that era, many radio stations, anxious to avoid even the hint of payola, often refused to play more than one or two new songs from any single record label at one time, so as to not appear to be offering favoritism to any particular label. To circumvent this, Stax, like many other record companies, created a number of subsidiary labels. Volt, founded in late 1961, was the label home to Otis Redding, the Bar-Kays, and a handful of other artists. Volt releases were initially issued by Atlantic through its subsidiary Atco Records. Other Stax subsidiaries over the years included Enterprise (named after the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, of which Al Bell was a fan), Chalice (a gospel label), Hip, Safice, Magic Touch, and Arch.

Redding&#x27;s first single, &quot;These Arms of Mine&quot;, issued in October 1962, hit both the R&amp;B and the pop charts. Though the label had enjoyed some early hits with the Mar-Keys and Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, Redding became the first Stax/Volt artist to consistently hit the charts with each release—in fact, each of Redding&#x27;s 17 singles issued during his lifetime charted. (Carla Thomas also charted with some consistency, but her pre-1965 releases were on Atlantic, not Stax or Volt.)

Between January 1962 and December 1964, Stax and Volt released several chart hits each by Otis Redding, Rufus Thomas, and Booker T. and the M.G.&#x27;s. However, despite dozens of other releases, only three other Stax/Volt singles charted during this time, and all just barely: William Bell&#x27;s &quot;You Don&#x27;t Miss Your Water&quot; hit #95 in early 1962; the Mar-Keys&#x27; &quot;Pop-Eye Stroll&quot; hit #94 in mid-1962 (although it was a big hit in Canada, hitting #1 on Toronto&#x27;s CHUM Chart), and Barbara &amp; the Browns&#x27; &quot;Big Party&quot; made it to #97 in mid-1964.

Beginning in 1965, when the label formalized its distribution agreement with Atlantic, Stax/Volt artists made the charts much more frequently.

===1965–1967: Stax/Volt&#x27;s continued success===
In 1965, Jim Stewart signed a formal national distribution deal with Atlantic Records, although fatefully he signed the contract without reading it—a decision that would later cost the label dearly. Carla Thomas also formally rejoined the Stax label in 1965. Perhaps more importantly for the label&#x27;s fortunes, the songwriting team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter began to establish themselves as Stax&#x27;s new team of hit writer/producers. Hayes would also permanently join the Stax house band, often subbing for Booker T. Jones, who was studying music full-time at Indiana University during the mid-1960s.

In addition to hits by stalwarts Redding, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, and Carla Thomas, 1965 saw the chart debuts of Stax artists the Astors and Sam &amp; Dave plus Volt artists the Mad Lads. Sam &amp; Dave were technically on the Atlantic roster but were &quot;leased&quot; to Stax by Atlantic, with Stax overseeing their recordings and issuing them on the Stax label. Virtually all of Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s Stax material was written and produced by Hayes and Porter.

Atlantic&#x27;s Jerry Wexler also brought Don Covay and Wilson Pickett to record at Stax, though these songs were released directly by Atlantic. Covay&#x27;s hits &quot;See Saw&quot; and &quot;Sookie Sookie&quot; and Pickett&#x27;s 1965 and 1966 hits &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It&quot;, &quot;634-5789&quot; and &quot;Ninety-Nine and a Half (Won&#x27;t Do)&quot; were Stax songs in all but name, as they were all co-written by Steve Cropper, recorded at Stax, and backed by the Stax house band. Although Wexler was greatly enamoured of Stax&#x27;s &quot;organic&quot; recording methods, some of the artists they brought in created conflict. A June 1965 session with Don Covay created bad feelings, which came to a head in early 1966, when Wilson Pickett returned to record new material. Although the session produced two hit songs—&quot;634-5789&quot; and &quot;Ninety-Nine and a Half (Won&#x27;t Do)&quot;—Pickett&#x27;s &quot;corrosive&quot; character caused havoc in the studio; the session musicians eventually walked out, and the breaking point came when Pickett followed them outside and offered them $100 each (US$ in dollars) to complete the session. As a result, the furious house band bluntly told Jim Stewart not to bring &quot;that asshole&quot; to the studio again. Also tired of another label capitalizing on the Stax sound, Stewart phoned Wexler soon after the Pickett session and told him that he wanted to do no more Stax productions of non-Stax artists. One Atlantic artist who was thus not able to record at Stax was the newly signed Aretha Franklin. She instead was sent to Rick Hall&#x27;s FAME studios in Alabama, which had a sound similar to that of Stax. Pickett&#x27;s subsequent hits were also recorded elsewhere, including at Fame and American Group Productions, Chips Moman&#x27;s Memphis studio.

Through 1966 and 1967, Stax and its subsidiaries hit their stride, regularly scoring hits with artists such as Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Carla Thomas, William Bell, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, Eddie Floyd, the Bar-Kays, Albert King, and the Mad Lads. In 1966, Floyd recorded a tune named &quot;Knock on Wood&quot;, which he wrote with Steve Cropper; Stewart was initially indifferent to the tune but released it after he was outvoted by the house band on the notion of issuing the record. It became an international smash hit, and Stewart reflected positively on its success afterward.

Unlike Motown, which frequently packaged its artists on review tours, Stax only infrequently sponsored concerts to promote its acts. The first of such concerts was in the summer of 1965, in Los Angeles rather than in Memphis. While the show was a success, the Watts riots began the day afterward, and several Stax artists were trapped in Watts during the violence. Stax also sponsored a Christmas concert in Memphis for several years, the most notorious of which was held in 1968, when special guest Janis Joplin performed drunk and was booed off of the stage. The most successful Stax package revue was a tour of England and France in 1967, which played to sold-out crowds. Stax released several live albums from the tour recordings, including the best-selling &quot;Otis Live in Europe&quot;.

In 1967 Stax was at the height of its fame. Alongside Otis Redding were soul singers Sam and Dave, Carla Thomas and writer Isaac Hayes, who would have a deep impact on funk music in the 1970s. Also signed to the record label was the house band, Booker T. and the M.G.&#x27;s, who were breaking boundaries in integration. Two of the band members were black and two were white, which at the time was unheard of, because of racial turmoil in the United States.

In contrast to Stax&#x27;s rapidly rising fortunes at this time, most of the house band were struggling to make a living: the musicians often worked long hours in the studio during the day, developing songs and arrangements, but they were paid for recordings only when the actual sessions took place, so most had to play at local venues in the evenings to earn enough to support themselves and their families. To remedy this, in 1966 Al Bell appointed the members of the so-called Big Six (Hayes, Porter and Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s) as full-time salaried employees of Stax, on a fixed salary of $125 a week (US$ in dollars). This allowed them to quit their night jobs and become full-time professional studio musicians, and from this point on Booker T. and the M.G.&#x27;s regularly backed virtually all of the artists who recorded at Stax. Bell also persuaded Jim Stewart to set up a &quot;production pool&quot;, in which a small portion of the royalty payments Stax was receiving from Atlantic was split equally between the Big Six to pay them for their production duties with the artists they backed.

Stax was located in Memphis, Tennessee, which was still a segregated city, where Martin Luther King Jr., a leader of the civil rights movement, was assassinated in 1968. While there was much racism around the artists, the Stax recording studio seemed to be an escape from the turmoil of the real world. When the artists went into the studio, they were there for one reason only, and that was to make hit music, some of which had the social consciousness that became a soundtrack for the civil rights movement. On their 1967 tour in Europe, some of the Stax artists were taken aback by the welcome that they received, enjoying a better reception in parts of Europe than in the United States.

Although the trip was a huge success for the artists and their label, it also marked another significant change in the political landscape at Stax. At a fraught tour meeting in Al Bell&#x27;s hotel room, Steve Cropper was summarily removed as Stax&#x27;s A&amp;R director, and Al Bell took over the position. Following the touring party&#x27;s return to Memphis, Bell was also promoted to executive vice president, and horn players Wayne Jackson and Andrew Love joined the Stax rhythm section as salaried Stax employees.

===1968: break with Atlantic Records===
In 1967, Atlantic Records was sold to Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. The sale of Atlantic to Warner activated a &quot;key man&quot; clause (which Jim Stewart had insisted upon) in the distribution contract between Stax and Atlantic. This called for the renegotiation or termination of the distribution deal in the event that Stewart&#x27;s nominated &quot;key man&quot; at Atlantic—Jerry Wexler—either left the company or sold his stock in Atlantic. Stax initially hoped to join Atlantic in the Warner buyout, so Jim Stewart, Estelle Axton and Al Bell flew to New York hoping to negotiate a deal, but according to Stewart the figure they were offered was &quot;an insult&quot;. Stewart then approached Warner-Seven Arts directly, but their offer was similarly unacceptable to Stax.

Unhappy with either offer, Stewart then asked for the return of the Stax masters, but the executives at Warner-Seven Arts refused. It was then that he was informed that Atlantic&#x27;s lawyer Paul Marshall had included a clause in the 1965 distribution contract that gave Atlantic all right, title and interest, including any rights of reproduction, in all Stax&#x27;s Atlantic-distributed recordings between 1960 and 1967. Only its unreleased recordings remained the property of Stax; all of the masters delivered to Atlantic between 1960 and 1967 are still wholly owned by Atlantic&#x27;s current parent company, Warner Music Group.

Stewart regarded his original deal with Wexler as a gentleman&#x27;s agreement, and when the distribution arrangement was formalized with a contract in 1965, he had signed it without reading it, thus missing the fateful ownership clause. Stewart was furious at what he felt was Atlantic&#x27;s—and Wexler&#x27;s—betrayal of his trust, although Wexler continued to insist for years that he also had not read the contract and had nothing to do with the ownership clause, and Wexler resented the situation in his 1993 autobiography &quot;Rhythm and the Blues&quot;:

As a result of this turn of events, Stewart did not renew his distribution deal with Atlantic, and, on May 13, 1968, he instead sold Stax to Paramount Pictures, a unit of Gulf+Western; the sale brought it into direct co-ownership with Dot Records, a pop label Paramount had owned since 1957. Consequently, Stax was forced to move forward without the most desirable portion of its back catalogue and without Sam and Dave, who had been unofficially &quot;on loan&quot; to Stax up to this point, and who were forced to return to Atlantic after the split (although they never scored another major hit). The company was dealt another crushing blow when its biggest and best-loved artist, Otis Redding, as well as all but two of the members of the Bar-Kays, died in a plane crash on December 10, 1967. In April 1968 Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, the place where many members of the Stax staff regularly met and ate, and where Steve Cropper and Eddie Floyd had written &quot;Knock on Wood&quot;. In the riots that followed King&#x27;s murder, many properties in the vicinity of the Stax studio were attacked by rioters, but Stax was left untouched.

Stewart remained at the company, and former Stax marketing executive Al Bell became the company&#x27;s vice president and a co-owner, taking on a more active role as Stewart became less active in Stax&#x27;s day-to-day operations. Estelle Axton disagreed with Bell&#x27;s visions for the company, and disputes between the two executives led to an impasse where Bell made plans to leave the company. Forced to choose between his sister and his vice president, Stewart asked Axton to step down from the company. By 1970, she had sold her shares and would later go on to found Fretone Records, which had a major success in 1976 with the chart-topping &quot;Disco Duck&quot;.

After the Atlantic distribution deal expired in May 1968, Atlantic briefly marketed Stax/Volt recordings made after the split. These recordings feature the alternate Stax/Volt logos used on the album covers on their labels, as opposed to the original Atlantic-era logos, such as the &quot;Stax-o-Wax&quot; logo. Stax label recordings were reissued on the Atlantic label, and Volt label material on the Atco label. Gulf+Western-owned Stax/Volt releases used new label designs, new logos (including the recognizable finger snapping logo) and new catalogue numbering systems to avoid confusion among the record distributors.

===1968–1972: Stax as an independent label===
Although Stax had also lost their most valuable artists, they recovered quickly. Johnnie Taylor gave Stax its first big post-Atlantic hit in 1968 with &quot;Who&#x27;s Making Love&quot;, which became the label&#x27;s best-selling single to that point. To begin rebuilding its catalog, Stax, under orders from Al Bell, released a whopping 27 albums (a Rufus Thomas album titled &quot;May I Have Your Ticket Please?&quot; was to be the 28th album released by the Gulf+Western-owned Stax, but the album was never finished) and 30 singles in mid-1969. Producer and songwriter Isaac Hayes stepped into the spotlight with &quot;Hot Buttered Soul&quot;. Originally seen just as a solo artistic project for Hayes to make up the numbers, it went on to sell over three million copies in 1969. By 1971, Hayes was established as the label&#x27;s biggest star and was particularly noted for his best-selling soundtrack to the 1971 blaxploitation film &quot;Shaft&quot;. Hayes&#x27; recordings were among the releases on a third major Stax label, Enterprise, which had been founded in 1967.

The label also enjoyed great success when it had the Staple Singers make a dramatic shift from Gospel music to mainstream R&amp;B. Al Bell began signing many more artists such as the Dramatics, Frederick Knight and The Soul Children. Even Rufus Thomas, one of the first artists signed to the label, enjoyed a popular resurgence with a string of hits in the late 1960s/early 1970s. However, Stax&#x27;s record sales were down overall under Paramount, whose management were also trying to exert more control of the operation. In 1970, Stewart and Bell decided to purchase the label back, with financial help from Deutsche Grammophon, the European record company owned at the time by the giant Grammophon-Philips Group (renamed PolyGram in 1972). The financing on Deutsche Grammophon&#x27;s end led to Stax&#x27;s post-Paramount recordings being distributed outside of the United States by DG&#x27;s pop label, Polydor Records, from 1970 until Stax fell into bankruptcy.

By the fall of 1970, both Steve Cropper and Booker T. Jones were frustrated with Stax&#x27;s treatment of the MGs, and left the company and stopped playing sessions for Stax. Even though Jones was given the title of Vice President at Stax before leaving, as he put it, &quot;There were titles given (to us) but we didn&#x27;t actually make the decisions.&quot; A final Booker T. and the MGs album was issued in 1971.

The two remaining MGs (Duck Dunn and Al Jackson) stayed on at Stax, working as session musicians on various Stax recordings, although they also worked elsewhere. In particular, Al Jackson worked extensively with Al Green at crosstown rival Hi Records, co-writing a number of Green&#x27;s hits between 1971 and 1975.

Stax, meanwhile, subsisted on its own between 1970 and 1972, using independent distributors. By mid-1971, the Stax logo was slightly altered in which the color of the finger-snapping hand was changed from blue to brown.

As co-owner, Bell undertook an ambitious program to make Stax not only a major recording company, but also a prominent force in the black community. For the first time, many of the label&#x27;s acts began frequently recording at outside studios (such as Ardent Studios in Memphis and at recording studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama) and working with outside producers, signaling an end of the signature Stax sound. Bell even created a comedy subsidiary label, Partee Records, which released albums from the likes of Richard Pryor and Moms Mabley; and he made a bid for the white pop market by signing Big Star and licensing albums by Terry Manning, the UK progressive rock band Skin Alley, and Lena Zavaroni. In addition, Bell became heavily involved with various causes in the African-American community, and was a close friend of the Reverend Jesse Jackson and a financial supporter of his Operation PUSH.

On August 20, 1972, the Stax label presented a major concert, Wattstax, featured performances by Stax recording artists and humor from rising young comedian Richard Pryor. Known as the &quot;Black Woodstock&quot;, Wattstax was hosted by Reverend Jesse Jackson and drew a crowd of over 100,000 people, most of them African-American. Wattstax was filmed by motion picture director Mel Stuart (&quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;), and a concert film of the event was released to theaters by Columbia Pictures in February 1973.

By this time, the Stax recording studio was accepting outside work again. In July and December 1973, Elvis Presley recorded three albums at Stax: &quot;Raised on Rock&quot;, &quot;Good Times&quot;, and &quot;Promised Land&quot;, which produced four top 20 hits for RCA, the label to which Elvis had been signed since 1955.

===1972–1975: decline and bankruptcy===
Despite the success of Wattstax, the future of Stax was unstable. In 1972, Bell bought out Stewart&#x27;s remaining interest in the company, and established a distribution deal with CBS Records. CBS Records President Clive Davis saw Stax as a means for CBS to fully break into the African-American market and successfully compete with Motown. Bell had originally proposed that CBS buy 50% of the company, but Davis discussed it with CBS&#x27;s corporate attorneys, who saw anti-trust problems, so a national distribution deal was worked out instead. However, Davis was fired by the company shortly after signing the Stax distribution deal because of reports that he used funds from CBS for personal expenditures, including an expensive bar mitzvah of his son. (Davis, for his part, continues to insist that the &quot;official&quot; reason for his firing was only a convenient excuse and that, in reality, his quick ouster was a matter of personality conflict.) Without Davis at the helm, CBS very quickly lost interest in Stax.

The deal was altered by having the Stax labels&#x27; profits cut by up to 40%, particularly since the CBS distribution agents bypassed the traditional small mom-and-pop record sellers in the black community which had been the backbone of Stax&#x27;s distribution, and weren&#x27;t pushing the Stax product to the larger retailers for fear of undercutting rack space for CBS R&amp;B artists such as Earth Wind and Fire, the Isley Brothers, and Sly &amp; the Family Stone; additionally, CBS reportedly displayed a greater level of favoritism toward Philadelphia International Records, which was distributed by CBS and had become a formidable competitor of Stax and Motown combined. Reports came in to Stax of stores in cities such as Chicago and Detroit being unable to get new Stax records despite consumer demands, and the company attempted to annul its distribution deal with CBS. However, although CBS was uninterested in fully promoting Stax, it refused to release the label from its contract, for fear that Stax would land a more productive deal with another company and then become CBS&#x27;s direct competitor.

The last big chart hit for Stax was &quot;Woman to Woman&quot; in 1974 from Shirley Brown, which appeared on subsidiary label, Truth, handled by independent distributors. The single&#x27;s success helped delay the inevitable demise of the company for several months. By 1975, all of the secondary Stax labels had folded, with only the main Stax label and Truth remaining. Stax had signed artists like Joyce Cobb bringing her over from their Truth country music label that year, but were never able to produce recordings with her and other new talent. Truth was able to release a couple of other singles and an album by Shirley Brown.

Al Bell attempted to stave off bankruptcy with bank loans from Memphis&#x27; Union Planters Bank. Jim Stewart, unwilling to see the company die, returned to active participation in Stax and mortgaged his Memphis mansion to provide the label with short-term working capital. However, the Union Planters bank officers soon got cold feet, and foreclosed on the loans, costing Stewart his home and fortune. In the 2014 documentary &quot;Take Me To The River&quot;, Bell states unequivocally that the city&#x27;s white power structure loathed the presence of such a successful black-owned company and was determined to destroy it by any means necessary, using the bank loans as an excuse.

Stax/Volt Records was forced into involuntary bankruptcy on December 19, 1975 and was closed by order of federal bankruptcy judge William B. Leffler on January 12, 1976. Three days before the bankruptcy proceedings, Union Planters intended to produce a memorial record album for Martin Luther King Jr. in which the proceeds would go toward allowing Stax to continue operation.

===1976–1977: Stax in limbo===
Al Bell was arrested and indicted for bank fraud during the Stax bankruptcy proceedings, but was acquitted of those charges in August 1976. In early 1977, Union Planters sold Stax, its master tapes, and its publishing arms for about four million dollars to a holding corporation. This corporation then sold the Stax-owned master recordings, as well as the name &quot;Stax Records&quot;, to Fantasy Records later that same year.

Effectively, that meant that Fantasy owned and controlled all Stax material recorded after May 1968 and the handful of pre-May 1968 Stax singles and albums Atlantic initially declined to distribute nationally in the 1960s (none of which were hits). Fantasy also gained control and ownership of all unreleased tracks and alternate takes of Stax recordings, including those recorded before May 1968, and gained the right to issue new recordings under the Stax Records banner.

Stax&#x27;s one-time McLemore Ave. headquarters were not sold until 1981, when Union Planters deeded it to the Southside Church of God in Christ for ten dollars.

Almo/Irving Music, the music publishing partner of A&amp;M Records, acquired East Memphis Music, Stax&#x27;s publishing arm, in 1981.

===1978–1981: Stax resumes operations===
In October 1977, Fantasy announced it would set up a Memphis office primarily for the purposes of reviving the Stax label, with local promoter Bruce Bowles being hired as Fantasy&#x27;s regional promotion and marketing manager. The next month, Fantasy appointed long-time Stax writer and producer David Porter to head up a revived version of the Stax label, which was relaunched in January 1978. Porter signed several new acts to Stax, including Fat Larry&#x27;s Band, Rick Dees and Sho Nuff, and re-signed mid-1970s Stax acts Rance Allen, Soul Children and Shirley Brown. Porter was also responsible for overseeing compilations of previously unissued material by Isaac Hayes, Randy Brown, the Bar-Kays, Albert King and the Emotions.

This iteration of Stax released over two dozen singles, including nine that made the US R&amp;B charts. By far the biggest hit of this era was the Bar-Kays&#x27; &quot;Holy Ghost&quot;, a #9 R&amp;B hit in 1978; it was a remixed and over-dubbed version of a track the band had recorded for Stax in 1975.

Fantasy had to make do, however, without many of the well-known acts on Stax, who moved on to other labels during the bankruptcy proceedings and were enjoying a string of hits at their new homes, including the Bar-Kays (on Mercury), Johnnie Taylor (on Columbia, where he had the nation&#x27;s first RIAA-certified Platinum single in &quot;Disco Lady&quot;), Isaac Hayes (on Polydor), the Staple Singers, Richard Pryor (both on Warner Bros.), the Dramatics (on ABC), Shirley Brown (on Arista), and the Emotions (on Columbia, and later on ARC after their new producer Maurice White relaunched it as a vehicle for his productions).

Porter left Stax in 1979, and the label&#x27;s new releases slowed to a trickle. By late 1981, Stax was strictly in the business of reissuing material recorded between 1968 through 1975 and previously unreleased archival material from the 1960s and 1970s.

===1982–2003: Stax as a reissue label===

Through much of the 1980s and 1990s, Stax activities focused exclusively on re-issues. Because Atlantic owned (and still owns) most of the Atlantic-era Stax master recordings released up to May 1968, the Atlantic-controlled material has been reissued by co-owned Rhino Records or licensed to Collectables Records.

Fantasy, meanwhile, also repackaged and re-released the Stax catalogue it controlled, on the Stax label. Because Fantasy owned the non-master recordings of all Stax material, for several of its Stax compilations, Fantasy issued alternate takes of the Stax hit recordings in place of the master recordings owned by Atlantic.

In 1988, Fantasy issued the various artists album &quot;Top of the Stax, Vol. 1: Twenty Greatest Hits&quot;. This marked the first time an album was issued with both Atlantic-owned and Fantasy-owned Stax material; it was issued by arrangement with Atlantic Records. A second volume was released by Fantasy in 1991.

In 1991, Atlantic issued &quot;The Complete Stax/Volt Singles 1959–1968&quot;, a nine-disc compact disc boxed set containing all of the Atlantic-era Stax a-sides. This release earned Grammy Award nominations for producer Steve Greenberg in the Best Historical Album category and for writer Rob Bowman in the Best Album Notes category. The boxed set was certified gold in 2001, the largest collection of CDs ever to have earned that certification. Fantasy followed their lead and issued volumes two and three of the &quot;Complete Stax/Volt Soul Singles&quot; series in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Volume Two compiles the Stax/Volt singles from 1968 to 1971, while Volume Three completes the collection with the singles issued from 1972 to 1975. Volume Three earned a Best Album Notes Grammy Award for Rob Bowman. In 2000, Fantasy issued a boxed set titled &quot;The Stax Story&quot;, which includes pre-1968 material by arrangement with Atlantic.

Fantasy tried to revive Stax&#x27;s sister label Volt Records twice during this time, first in the late 1980s and again in the late 1990s.

===2003–present: Stax Museum and revival of the label===

After a decade of neglect, the Southside Church of God in Christ tore down the original Stax studio in 1989. Over a decade later the Stax Museum of American Soul Music operated by the non-profit, Soulsville Foundation, was constructed at the site and opened in 2003. A replica of the original building, the Stax Museum features exhibits on the history of Stax and soul music in general, and hosts various music-related community programs and events. The Soulsville Foundation also operates the Stax Music Academy and The Soulsville Charter School, all part of the same campus where the original Stax Records was created.

Concord Records purchased the Fantasy Label Group in 2004, and in December 2006 announced the reactivation of the Stax label as a forum for newly recorded music. The first acts signed to the new Stax included Isaac Hayes, Angie Stone, and Soulive.

The formal relaunch came with the release on March 13, 2007 of &quot;Stax 50th Anniversary Celebration&quot;, a 2-CD box set containing 50 tracks from the entire history of Stax Records.
The first Concord-distributed Stax album of all-new material was a various artists CD which was released on March 27, 2007 and titled &quot;Interpretations: Celebrating The Music of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire&quot;. Soulive was the first artist on revived label to release an album of all-new material with &quot;No Place Like Soul&quot; released July 10, 2007.

On August 28, 2007, a 3 CD Deluxe Edition box set of the 1972 music event Wattstax was released, simply titled &quot;WATTSTAX&quot;. For the first time in over 30 years almost half of the 25-plus performers at that event were finally heard for the first time, released in remastered stereo. The 3-CD set still only covers about one-third of the entire Wattstax concert, which lasted 10+ hours; Concord has not issued any statement as to the possibility of preparing future releases that would cover the remaining Wattstax material. (Isaac Hayes&#x27; complete Wattstax set was released on CD in 1995.)

On April 9, 2013, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama hosted an event called &quot;In Performance at the White House: Memphis Soul&quot;. Invited Stax artists included Booker T. Jones, Steve Cropper, Eddie Floyd, and Sam Moore. First Lady Obama also led a workshop called, &quot;Soulsville, USA: The History of Memphis Soul.&quot;

In 2012 as part of the label revival, Stax Records signed Ben Harper and released his album with Charlie Musselwhite called &quot;Get Up!&quot; on January 29, 2013. Harper won a Grammy Award for Best Blues Album.

Nathaniel Rateliff &amp; The Night Sweats released their critically acclaimed self-titled debut album on August 21, 2015. The band&#x27;s live performance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; is credited with having boosted the band into the mainstream.

In 2016, Stax issued an album of new material by one of the label&#x27;s original artists, William Bell, recorded in New York City and co-produced by him and Jon Leventhal. Stax Records was inducted into National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame on June 6, 2015 and was accepted by former Stax producer Al Bell in Clarksdale, MS.

On September 22, 2017, Stax released &quot;Soulsville U.S.A. (A Celebration of Stax)&quot;, a three-CD compilation containing 60 tracks from the entire history of Stax Records. This release is an update of the &quot;Stax 50th Anniversary Celebration&quot; two-CD compilation from 2007. &quot;Soulsville U.S.A.&quot; contains twelve tracks not included in &quot;Stax 50th&quot;; there are two tracks in &quot;Stax 50th&quot; that are not included in &quot;Soulsville U.S.A.&quot;

Written In Their Soul: The Stax Songwriter Demos, a compilation of 146 demos from Stax, won the 2023 Grammy Awards for Liner Notes and Best Historical Album.

In 2024 Stax was the subject of an HBO documentary series &quot;&quot; tracing the label&#x27;s triumphs and trials to the present day.

<text>A hand drum is any type of drum that is typically played with the bare hand rather than a stick, mallet, hammer, or other type of beater.

==Types==
The following descriptions allude to traditional versions of the drums. Modern synthetic versions are available for most if not all of the drums listed through various manufacturers.

===Middle and Near East===
*The tar is a frame drum common in Middle Eastern music. 
*The tambourine is a frame drum with jingles attached to the shell.
*The daf and the dayereh are Iranian frame drums.
*The ghaval is the Azerbaijani frame drum.
*The tonbak is the Persian goblet drum.
*The doumbek is a goblet shaped drum used in Arabic, Jewish, Assyrian, Persian, Balkan, Greek, Armenian, Azeri and Turkish music.
* Mirwas

===Africa===
*The most common African drum known to westerners is the djembe, a large, single-headed drum with a goblet shape.
*The Ashiko is another African drum in the shape of a truncated cone. Similar to the Djembe it is rope strung. This drum is easily recognized as having straight sides (many actually have a slight curve but appear straight compared to most hand drums). The ashiko contrary to popular belief is traditionally mounted with wild game heads such as a gazelle. Most modern Ashikos are made with goat skin as a matter of convenience or legality. A more traditional-sounding Ashiko can be created using hand-picked goat skins that imitate the game skin or using deer skin (which requires more frequent tuning and maintenance). Ashiko drums are quite popular but less so than other types of hand drums and the difficulty in making sound as it should traditionally probably explains why they are less common. Most Ashikos found in common use have a non-traditional sound to them due to different skin types being used.
*Bougarabou are African drums with cow skin heads. The base of the um drum is shorter than a djembe and the goblet shape less pronounced. (This is believed by some to be the African traditional predecessor of the Conga.)
*The Dundun talking drum, is a class of hour glass shaped drum that is popular amongst the Yoruba people of West Africa. Dun-dun literarily translates to &quot;Sweet-Sound&quot;. The class includes the largest in the ensemble Iya-Ilu (mother drum) and other smaller category like Ijin, Gangan, Adamo, and the smallest of the ensemble is called kanago. Depending on the parts of the Yoruba region, other types of Dundun drum in between may be available. 
*The Batá drum is often used for spiritual worship of Sango in Yoruba, Cuba and Brazil. It has drums in category of Iya Ilu (mother drum) and other smaller drums. Omele Bata is a triplet bunch of strapped drums in the Bata Drum Category. 
*The Gudu-gudu drum is a pace-maker drum that is used in both Dundun and Bata drum category.
*The Bembe drum is a Yoruba base drum. The modern base drum in drum sets used by professional musicians and military/school parades is an example of modified bemebe drum. 
*The Ipese drum is used for Yoruba Spiritual worship of Ifa. 
*The Igbin drum is used for Yoruba Spiritual worship of Obatala.
*Another type of drum family called Dundun is from Guinea. This is different from the Yoruba talking drum. It has 3 types of drums, the Dundun Songba and Kenke.

===Latin percussion===
*Congas and bongos are essential to all kinds of Latin American music, especially that of the Caribbean and South American regions, used in both folklore (punta, santeria, rumba, etc.) and popular music such as merengue, salsa, son, boleros, bachata, cumbia, latin jazz, and others.
*The Tambora, a two-sided drum played with both a stick and a hand, is essential to the merengue dance of Dominican Republic.
*The pandero or plenera, is a percussion instrument included in the group of frame drums. A set of these hand drums from Puerto Rico is usually performed in plena music. There are three sizes, primo or requinto (for playing solos), segundo or seguidor, and tercero or tumbador (for playing a fixed rhythm).
*The maracas and timbales are widely played in popular music.
*The cajón is a box-shaped percussion instrument originating from Peru, primarily played in Afro-Peruvian music, as well as contemporary styles of flamenco and jazz.
*The Ilu is popular in Pernambuco and Ceará.

===Far East and India===

* Tabla are central to Indian music.
* The mridangam takes the main spot in Indian classical (Carnatic) music.
* Kanjiras accompany the mridangam in carnatic music.
* Răbāna or Raban, Gáta Béra, Yak Béra and Udákkiya are used in Sri Lankan music.
* One drum head in Daŭla is played by hand, which is again used in Sri Lanka.
* Dhōlki is used both in Sri Lanks and India.
* Klong yao is the Thai &quot;long drum&quot; which is shaped like an elongated or stretched goblet and rope tuned.
* The tsuzumi (kotsuzumi) and the ōtsuzumi are Japanese hand drums, used in traditional Noh and Kabuki theatres. 
** The &quot;Den-den daiko&quot; is a Japanese hand-held drum, used in Shinto-Buddhist ceremonies, etc.

===Europe===
*The Irish Bodhrán is sometimes played with the bare hand.

<text>The Kowloon Motor Bus Company (1933) Limited (KMB) is a bus company operating franchised services in Hong Kong. It is the largest bus company in Hong Kong by fleet size and number of bus routes, with over 4,000 buses - mostly double deckers - and 420 routes. It is a subsidiary of Transport International.

==History==



KMB was founded on 13 April 1933 as a result of the reformation of public transport by the Hong Kong Government. Before the reformation, there were several independent bus operators working on both sides of Victoria Harbour including KMB.

The Hong Kong Government enforces the bus franchises in favour of the franchisees, while it prosecutes the operators of unauthorised private bus services and other types of authorised bus service that pick up or drop off passengers in franchised bus parking zones.

The KMB franchise allowed for the operation of public omnibus service on the Kowloon side as well as the New Territories. By 11 June 1933, KMB had a fleet of 106 single-deck buses.

The founding members of KMB were:
*Tang Shiu-kin (鄧肇堅)
*William Louey Sui Tak (雷瑞德)
*Lui Leung (雷亮)
*Tam Woon Tong (譚煥堂)
*Lam Ming Fan (林明勳)

By December 1941, KMB had 140 single-deckers operating on 17 routes. As only a handful of buses survived World War II, some lorries were temporarily converted into buses. By the late 1940s, KMB ridership increased with the huge influx of immigrants from Mainland China. In 1949, KMB bought 20 Daimler double-deckers from England, becoming the first operator of double-deckers in Hong Kong.

Following the opening of the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in 1972, KMB operated a number of cross-harbour routes jointly with China Motor Bus, the sole bus operator on Hong Kong Island. This marked the first time KMB buses running on the island. In the same year, KMB began experimenting with buses operating without a fare collector. All passengers would board from the front door and pay the fare by putting money into the collection box next to the driver.

In 1996, KMB launched an advertising campaign to promote modern image. It is the first bus company advertising in Hong Kong.

On 1 June 1997, KMB formed a subsidiary, Long Win Bus, to provide service on the Lantau Link to the new Hong Kong International Airport and Tung Chung. In 1998, KMB extended its business into mainland China with a co-operative joint venture, Dalian Hong Kong Macau Company. In 1999, due to the abuse of the free fare imposed on KCR East Rail feeder routes (K12 - K18) as non-franchised buses, the KCR signed a contract with KMB which stated that these routes are operated de facto by the KMB as franchised bus routes while all profits goes to the KCR corporation; this contract is still in effect after the KCR-MTR merger.

In July 2007, KMB commenced operating a 10-year franchise, that has since been renewed until June 2027. In April 2023, KMB celebrated its 90th anniversary.

==Routes==
, KMB operated 446 routes in Kowloon and the New Territories, and operates cross-harbour tunnel routes in which some are operated in co-operation with the two other bus operators New World First Bus (by June 2023) and Citybus while some are operated by themselves solely. The following is the numbering system of bus routes that the KMB currently adapts:

===Numbering System by numbers and district ===
*1-29, 201-229: Kowloon Peninsula (Except route 14S, which terminates at Tseung Kwan O Chinese Permanent Cemetery located in Sai Kung District)
*30-49, 230-249: Kwai Tsing District and Tsuen Wan District
*50-69, 250-269: Tuen Mun District and Yuen Long District (Except routes 64P and 65K, which serve the Tai Po District exclusively)
*70-79, 270-279: Tai Po District and Northern District
*80-89, 280-289: Sha Tin District
*90-99, 290-299: Sai Kung District
*100-199: Cross harbour routes via the Cross-Harbour Tunnel
*300-399: Express peak hour cross harbour routes using any harbour crossing tunnel (Except 307)
*600-699: Cross harbour routes via the Eastern Harbour Crossing
*900-999: Cross harbour Routes via the Western Harbour Crossing

Routes 200-299 were previously deluxe bus services utilising single-decker coaches. In the 1990s, it is mandatory for 2xx routes to be fully air-conditioned except for emergency situation (e.g. opening of Tsing Ma Bridge, air-con bus breakdown); with the introduction of low-floor buses from 1998, emergency situations are no longer necessary. Since the withdrawal of the last non air-conditioned bus in 2012, all bus routes operated by the KMB uses air-conditioned buses, hence this assignment had practically lost its meaning.

===Letter Assignments in bus routes===
*Prefixes
**A: Airport deluxe routes for Kai Tak Airport, all cancelled in 1998 due to its closure
**B: Border area routes
**H: Hospital routes, operated one during the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak

**M: Feeder routes to the Airport Express (MTR), now cancelled
**N: Overnight routes
**P: Deluxe bus services for cross-harbour New Territories routes (eg. P960, P968)
**R: Routes for special events
**T: Express bus routes to help relief the heavy passenger load of the East Rail line
**W: Feeder routes to the Shenzhen–Hong Kong high-speed train terminus at West Kowloon Station
**X: Express routes 
*Suffixes:

**E: Express bus routes for some cases such as 40E and 87E
**H: Hospital routes (eg. 14H, 32H)

**R: Routes operated during public holidays and/or public events with the exception of 5R, which provides full day service
**S: Special routes, including some overnight routes, routes operated due to big events or peak hour routes
**X: Express bus routes with exceptions

==Fares==
Passengers pay the fare in cash (no change given), with a contactless credit card (VISA, MasterCard, Amex, UnionPay, Discover, JCB), QR code payment, mobile wallet or using an Octopus card, a smart card payment system. Discounts apply for Octopus users on specified route interchange combinations. To enable elderly people and eligible persons with disabilities to travel on the general Mass Transit Railway (MTR) lines, franchised buses and ferries are charged concessionary fare of $2 per trip, starting from 2012. The scheme aims to help build a caring and inclusive society by encouraging these groups to participate more in community activities.

In 2018, KMB launched the KMB Monthly Pass. Fares are fixed at HK$780, and are not applicable to MTR Feeder Bus services operated by KMB. Holders are able to take 10 rides on ordinary routes and 2 rides on route B1 per day during the validity month of the pass. Passes can be purchased using an Octopus card at machines installed at major public transport interchanges and bus terminals.

==Fleet==
As of the end of 2023, Kowloon Motor Bus operated a fleet of 4056 buses. 584 Euro VI buses (including 3 diesel-electric buses), 2,935 Euro V buses and 10 battery-electric buses.

KMB traditionally purchased buses from English manufacturers including AEC, Daimler, Dennis, Guy Motors, Leyland, Metro Cammell Weymann and Seddon, that either were bodied in England or locally.

In 1975, the first air-conditioned bus in Hong Kong was put into service by KMB. Following the testing of double-deck air-conditioned buses Victory and Jubilant in the early 1980s, KMB became the world&#x27;s first operator of such buses. All purchases after 1995 were for air-conditioned buses. In May 2012, KMB withdrew its last non-air-conditioned buses from service. Some of the newer third-generation buses have solar photovoltaic panels installed on the roof which reduces fuel use by 5-8% which would otherwise be used for the air conditioner. This is expected to reduce of carbon emissions on each bus per year.

In the late 1970s, it began to purchase chassis from European manufacturers MAN, Mercedes-Benz, Scania and Volvo.

KMB&#x27;s original liveries were combinations of red and cream. In the early 1990s, a white and grey livery was introduced for air-conditioned buses, followed in 1997 by a champagne livery. In June 2017, a red and silver livery was introduced, as well as a new logo, dropping its character and Chinese slogan, retaining only the wordmark, but with a darker shade of red.

In the 2020s, KMB introduced a vivid &quot;Electric Green&quot; livery on zero emission buses. KMB expects to have 500 battery electric buses by the end of 2025, which will account for an eighth of the total bus fleet.

==Depots==
KMB operate four depots in Kowloon and the New Territories. The depot of a bus is identified by the letter K, L, S, or U, and the letter is marked on the bottom left of the driver&#x27;s windscreen or below windscreen. The assignment scheme is as follows:
*K: Kowloon Bay depot
**Subsidiary depot: Tseung Kwan O depot
*L: Lai Chi Kok (Stonecutters Island) depot
**Subsidiary depots: Yuet Lun Street depot, Tsing Yi depot
*S: Sha Tin (Siu Lek Yuen) depot
**Subsidiary depots: Tai Po depot, Sheung Shui depot (Sheung Shui depot was previously under the Tuen Mun depot until 2009)
*U: Formerly Un Long (Yuen Long) depot, currently Tuen Mun depot
**Subsidiary depots: Tuen Mun South depot, Yuen Long depot, Tin Shui Wai depot, Sheung Shui depot (until 2009)

In addition, these depots with the exception of the Kowloon Bay Depot are responsible for the maintenance of part of the fleet owned by Long Win Bus, since the KMB and LWB are owned by the same parent company.

==Football team==

Kowloon Motor Bus also has a Hong Kong football club, Kowloon Motor Bus Co. It was formed in 1947 and joined Hong Kong First Division League in the 1947/48 season. Nicknamed &quot;Atomic Bus&quot;, the team obtained the only two league titles in 1953/54 and 1966/67. The team attained its peak in the 1950s and 1960s when the &quot;South China - Kowloon Motor Bus Co. crash&quot; () was one of the highlighted rival matches in Hong Kong. In 1970/71, the team faced their first relegation, but was able to stay in the First Division as Jardines quit the league in the following season. However, the team were relegated in 1972/73. It made its last First Division League appearance in 1976/77, but was relegated after only one season. The football team quit the league in 1981 and reformed in 2017.

<text>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (in case citations, 9th Cir.) is the U.S. federal court of appeals that has appellate jurisdiction over the U.S. district courts for the following federal judicial districts:
* District of Alaska
* District of Arizona
* Central District of California
* Eastern District of California
* Northern District of California
* Southern District of California
* District of Hawaii
* District of Idaho
* District of Montana
* District of Nevada
* District of Oregon
* Eastern District of Washington
* Western District of Washington

The Ninth Circuit also has appellate jurisdiction over the territorial courts for the District of Guam and the District of the Northern Mariana Islands. Additionally, it sometimes handles appeals that originate from American Samoa, which has no district court and partially relies on the District of Hawaii for its federal cases.

Headquartered in San Francisco, California, the Ninth Circuit is by far the largest of the 13 U.S. Courts of Appeals, covering a total of nine states and two territories and with 29 active judgeships. The court&#x27;s regular meeting places are Seattle at the William Kenzo Nakamura United States Courthouse, Portland at the Pioneer Courthouse, San Francisco at the James R. Browning U.S. Court of Appeals Building, and Pasadena at the Richard H. Chambers U.S. Court of Appeals. 

Panels of the court occasionally travel to hear cases in other locations within the circuit. Although the judges travel around the circuit, the court arranges its hearings so that cases from the northern region of the circuit are heard in Seattle or Portland, cases from southern California and Arizona are heard in Pasadena, and cases from northern California, Nevada, Hawaii, and the Pacific territories are heard in San Francisco. Additionally, the court holds yearly sittings in Anchorage and Honolulu. For lawyers who must come and present their cases to the court in person, this administrative grouping of cases helps to reduce the time and cost of travel. Ninth Circuit judges are also appointed by the United States secretary of the interior to serve as temporary acting Associate Justices for non-federal appellate sessions at the High Court of American Samoa in Fagatogo.

== History ==


The Ninth Circuit&#x27;s large size is due to the dramatic increases in both the population of the western states and the court&#x27;s geographic jurisdiction that have occurred since the U.S. Congress created the Ninth Circuit in 1891. The court was originally granted appellate jurisdiction over federal district courts in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. As new states and territories were added to the federal judicial hierarchy in the twentieth century, many of those in the West were placed in the Ninth Circuit: the newly acquired Territory of Hawaii in 1900, Arizona upon its admission to the Union in 1912, the Territory of Alaska in 1948, Guam in 1951, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in 1977.

The Ninth Circuit also had jurisdiction over certain American interests in China, in that it had jurisdiction over appeals from the United States Court for China during the existence of that court from 1906 through 1943.

However, the Philippines was never under the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s jurisdiction. Congress never created a federal district court in the Philippines from which the Ninth Circuit could hear appeals. Instead, appeals from the Supreme Court of the Philippines were taken directly to the Supreme Court of the United States.

In 1979, the Ninth Circuit became the first federal judicial circuit to set up a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel as authorized by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978.

The cultural and political jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit is just as varied as the land within its geographical borders. In a dissenting opinion in a rights of publicity case involving the &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; star Vanna White, Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski sardonically noted that &quot;[f]or better or worse, we are the Court of Appeals for the Hollywood Circuit.&quot; Judges from more remote parts of the circuit note the contrast between legal issues confronted by populous states such as California and those confronted by rural states such as Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada.

Judge Andrew J. Kleinfeld, who maintains his judicial chambers in Fairbanks, Alaska, wrote in a letter in 1998: &quot;Much federal law is not national in scope...It is easy to make a mistake construing these laws when unfamiliar with them, as we often are, or not interpreting them regularly, as we never do.&quot;

== Criticism ==
=== Rate of overturned decisions ===
From 1999 to 2008, of the Ninth Circuit Court rulings that were reviewed by the Supreme Court, 20% were affirmed, 19% were vacated, and 61% were reversed; the median reversal rate for all federal appellate courts was 68.29% for the same period. From 2010 to 2015, of the cases it accepted to review, the Supreme Court reversed around 79% of the cases from the Ninth Circuit, ranking its reversal rate third among the circuits; the median reversal rate for all federal circuits for the same time period was around 70 percent.

Some argue the court&#x27;s high percentage of reversals is illusory, resulting from the circuit hearing more cases than the other circuits. This results in the Supreme Court reviewing a smaller proportion of its cases, letting stand the vast majority of its cases.

However, a detailed study in 2018 reported by Brian T. Fitzpatrick, a law professor at Vanderbilt University, looked at how often a federal circuit court was reversed for every thousand cases it terminated on the merits between 1994 and 2015. The study found that the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decisions were reversed at a rate of 2.50 cases per thousand, which was by far the highest rate in the country, with the Sixth Circuit second as 1.73 cases per thousand. Fitzpatrick also noted that the 9th Circuit was unanimously reversed more than three times as often as the least reversed circuits and over 20% more often than the next closest circuit.

=== Size of the court ===
Many commentators have argued that the Ninth Circuit faces several adverse consequences of its large size, such as &quot;unwieldly size, procedural inefficiencies, jurisprudential unpredictability, and unusual &quot;en banc&quot; process.&quot;

Chief among these is the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s unique rules concerning the composition of an &quot;en banc&quot; court. In other circuits, &quot;en banc&quot; courts are composed of all active circuit judges, plus (depending on the rules of the particular court) any senior judges who took part in the original panel decision. By contrast, in the Ninth Circuit it is impractical for 29 or more judges to take part in a single oral argument and deliberate on a decision en masse. The court thus provides for a limited &quot;en banc&quot; review by the Chief Judge and a panel of 10 randomly selected judges. This means that &quot;en banc&quot; reviews may not actually reflect the views of the majority of the court and indeed may not include any of the three judges involved in the decision being reviewed in the first place. The result, according to detractors, is a high risk of &quot;intracircuit&quot; conflicts of law where different groupings of judges end up delivering contradictory opinions. That is said to cause uncertainty in the district courts and within the bar. However, &quot;en banc&quot; review is a relatively rare occurrence in all circuits and Ninth Circuit rules provide for full &quot;en banc&quot; review in limited circumstances.

All recently proposed splits would leave at least one circuit with 21 judges, only two fewer than the 23 that the Ninth Circuit had when the limited &quot;en banc&quot; procedure was first adopted. In other words, after a split at least one of the circuits would still be using limited &quot;en banc&quot; courts.

In March 2007, Associate Justices Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas testified before a House Appropriations subcommittee that the consensus among the justices of the Supreme Court of the United States was that the Ninth Circuit was too large and unwieldy and should be split.

Congressional officials, legislative commissions, and interest groups have all submitted proposals to divide the Ninth Circuit such as:
* Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1993, H.R. 3654
* Final Report of the Commission on Structural Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals
* Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals of Reorganization Act of 2003, S. 562
* Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act of 2003, H.R. 2723
* Ninth Circuit Judgeship and Reorganization Act of 2004, S. 878 (reintroduced as the Ninth Circuit Judgeship and Reorganization Act of 2005, H.R. 211, and co-sponsored by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay)
* Circuit Court of Appeals Restructuring and Modernization Act of 2005, S. 1845
* Circuit Court of Appeals Restructuring and Modernization Act of 2007, S. 525
* Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act of 2017, H.R. 196

The more recent proposals have aimed to redefine the Ninth Circuit to cover California, Hawaii, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands, and to create a new Twelfth Circuit to cover Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.

<doc id="325387" wikidata="Q255886" url="?curid=325387" title="Gill Sans">
<text>Gill Sans is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Eric Gill and released by the British branch of Monotype from 1928 onwards.

Gill Sans is based on Edward Johnston&#x27;s 1916 &quot;Underground Alphabet&quot;, the corporate font of London Underground. As a young artist, Gill had assisted Johnston in its early development stages. In 1926, Douglas Cleverdon, a young printer-publisher, opened a bookshop in Bristol, and Gill painted a fascia for the shop for him in sans-serif capitals. In addition, Gill sketched an alphabet for Cleverdon as a guide for him to use for future notices and announcements. By this time Gill had become a prominent stonemason, artist and creator of lettering in his own right and had begun to work on creating typeface designs.

Gill was commissioned to develop his alphabet into a full metal type family by his friend Stanley Morison, an influential Monotype executive and historian of printing. Morison hoped that it could be Monotype&#x27;s competitor to a wave of German sans-serif families in a new &quot;geometric&quot; style, which included Erbar, Futura and Kabel, all being launched to considerable attention in Germany during the late 1920s. Gill Sans was released in 1928 by Monotype, initially as a set of titling capitals that was quickly followed by a lower-case. Gill&#x27;s aim was to blend the influences of Johnston, classic serif typefaces and Roman inscriptions to create a design that looked both cleanly modern and classical at the same time. Designed before setting documents entirely in sans-serif text was common, its standard weight is noticeably bolder than most modern body text fonts.

An immediate success, the year after its release the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) chose it for all its posters, timetables and publicity material. British Railways chose Gill Sans as the basis for its standard lettering when the railway companies were nationalised in 1948. Gill Sans also soon became used on the modernist deliberately-simple covers of Penguin Books and was sold up to very large sizes, which were often used in British posters and notices of the period. Gill Sans was one of the dominant typefaces in British printing in the years after its release and remains extremely popular. It has been described as &quot;the British Helvetica&quot; because of its lasting popularity in British design. Gill Sans has influenced many other typefaces and helped to define a genre of sans-serif, known as the humanist style.

Monotype rapidly expanded the original regular or medium weight into a large family of styles, which it continues to sell. A basic set is included with some Microsoft software and macOS.

==Characteristics==

The proportions of Gill Sans stem from monumental Roman capitals in the upper case, and traditional &quot;old-style&quot; serif letters in the lower. This gives Gill Sans a very different style of design to geometric sans-serifs like Futura, based on simple squares and circles, or grotesque or &quot;industrial&quot; designs like Akzidenz-Grotesk, Helvetica and Univers influenced by nineteenth-century lettering styles. For example, compared to grotesque sans-serifs the &quot;C&quot; and &quot;a&quot; have a much less &quot;folded up&quot; structure, with wider apertures. The &quot;a&quot; and &quot;g&quot; in the roman or regular style are &quot;double-storey&quot; designs, rather than the &quot;single-storey&quot; forms used in handwriting and blackletter often found in grotesque and especially geometric sans-serifs.
The upper-case of Gill Sans is partly modelled on Roman capitals like those found on Trajan&#x27;s Column in Rome, with considerable variation in width. These had become a standard for inscriptional lettering in Britain at the time: Gill&#x27;s teacher Edward Johnston had written that, &quot;The Roman capitals have held the supreme place among letters for readableness and beauty. They are the best forms for the grandest and most important inscriptions.&quot; While Gill Sans is not based on purely geometric principles to the extent of the geometric sans-serifs that had preceded it, some aspects of Gill Sans do have a geometric feel. The J descends below the baseline. The &quot;O&quot; is an almost perfect circle and the capital &quot;M&quot; is based on the proportions of a square with the middle strokes meeting at the centre; this was not inspired by Roman carving but is very similar to Johnston. The &#x27;E&#x27; and &#x27;F&#x27; are also relatively narrow.
The influence of traditional serif letters is also clear in the &quot;two-storey&quot; lower-case &quot;a&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, unlike that of Futura, and the &quot;t&quot; with its curve to bottom right and slanting cut at top left, unlike Futura&#x27;s which is simply formed from two straight lines. The lower-case &quot;a&quot; also narrows strikingly towards the top of its loop, a common feature of serif designs but rarer in sans-serifs.

Following the traditional serif model the italic has different letterforms from the roman, where many sans-serifs simply slant the letters in what is called an oblique style. This is clearest in the &quot;a&quot;, which becomes a &quot;single storey&quot; design similar to handwriting, and the lower-case &quot;p&quot;, which has a calligraphic tail on the left reminiscent of italics such as those cut by William Caslon in the eighteenth century. The italic &quot;e&quot; is more restrained, with a straight line on the underside of the bowl where serif fonts normally add a curve. Like most serif fonts, several weights and releases of Gill Sans use ligatures to allow its expansive letter &quot;f&quot; to join up with or avoid colliding with following letters.

The basic letter shapes of Gill Sans do not look consistent across styles (or even in the metal type era all the sizes of the same style), especially in Extra Bold and Extra Condensed widths, while the Ultra Bold style is effectively a different design altogether and was originally marketed as such. Digital-period Monotype designer Dan Rhatigan, author of an article on Gill Sans&#x27;s development after Gill&#x27;s death, has commented: &quot;Gill Sans grew organically ... [it] takes a very &#x27;asystematic&#x27; approach to type. Very characteristic of when it was designed and of when it was used.&quot; (At this time the idea that sans-serif typefaces should form a consistent family, with glyph shapes as consistent as possible between all weights and sizes, had not fully developed: it was quite normal for families to vary as seemed appropriate for their weight until developments such as the groundbreaking release of Univers in 1957.)

In the light weights, the slanting cut at top left of the regular &quot;t&quot; is replaced with two separate strokes. From the bold weight upwards Gill Sans has an extremely eccentric design of &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; with the dots smaller than their parent letter&#x27;s stroke.
==Development==
Morison commissioned Gill to develop Gill Sans after they had begun to work together (often by post since Gill lived in Wales) on Gill&#x27;s serif design Perpetua from 1925 onwards; they had known each other since about 1913. Morison visited Cleverdon&#x27;s bookshop while in Bristol in 1927 where he saw and was impressed by Gill&#x27;s fascia and alphabet. Gill wrote that &quot;it was as a consequence of seeing these letters&quot; that Morison commissioned him to develop a sans-serif family.

In the period during and after his closest collaboration with Johnston, Gill had intermittently worked on sans-serif letter designs, including an almost sans-serif capital design in an alphabet for sign-painters in the 1910s and some capital letter signs around his home in Capel-y-ffin, Wales. Gill had greatly admired Johnston&#x27;s work on their Underground project, which he later wrote had &quot;redeemed the whole business of sans-serif from its nineteenth-century corruption&quot; of extreme boldness. Johnston apparently had not tried to turn the alphabet (as it was then called) that he had designed into a commercial typeface project. He had tried to get involved in type design before starting work on Johnston Sans, but without success since the industry at the time mostly created designs in-house. Morison similarly respected the design of the Underground system, one of the first and most lasting uses of a standard lettering style as corporate branding (Gill had designed a set of serif letters for WH Smith), writing that it &quot;conferred upon [the lettering] a sanction, civic and commercial, as had not been accorded to an alphabet since the time of Charlemagne&quot;.
Morison and Gill had met with some resistance within Monotype while developing Perpetua and while Morison was an enthusiastic backer of the project, Monotype&#x27;s engineering manager and type designer Frank Hinman Pierpont was deeply unconvinced, commenting that he could &quot;see nothing in this design to recommend it and much that is objectionable&quot;. (Pierpont was the creator of Monotype&#x27;s previous mainstay sans-serif, a loose family now called Monotype Grotesque. It is a much less sculptured design inspired by German sans-serifs.) Morison also intervened to insist that the letters &quot;J&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; be allowed to elegantly descend below the baseline, something not normal for titling typefaces which were often made to fill up the entire area of the metal type. In the early days of its existence it was not always consistently simply called &quot;Gill Sans&quot;, with other names such as &quot;Gill Sans-serif&quot;, &quot;Monotype Sans-Serif&quot; (the latter two both used by Gill in some of his publications) or its order numbers (such as Series No. 231) sometimes used.

A large amount of material about the development of Gill Sans survives in Monotype&#x27;s archives and in Gill&#x27;s papers. While the capitals (which were prepared first) resemble Johnston quite closely, the archives document Gill (and the drawing office team at Monotype&#x27;s works in Salfords Surrey, who developed a final precise design and spacing) grappling with the challenge of creating a viable humanist sans-serif lower-case as well as an italic, which Johnston&#x27;s design did not have. Gill&#x27;s first draft proposed many slanting cuts on the ends of ascenders and descenders, looking less like Johnston than the released version did, and quite long descenders. 
Early art for the italic also looked very different, with less of a slope, again very long descenders and swash capitals. The final version did not use the calligraphic italic &quot;g&quot; Gill preferred in his serif designs Perpetua and Joanna (and considered in the draft italic art), instead using a standard &quot;double-storey&quot; &quot;g&quot;.
In the regular or roman style of Gill Sans, some letters were simplified from Johnston, with diamond dots becoming round (rectangles in the later light weight) and the lower-case &quot;L&quot; becoming a simple line, but the &quot;a&quot; became more complex with a curving tail in most versions and sizes. In addition, the design was simply refined in general, for example by making the horizontals slightly narrower than verticals so that they do not appear unbalanced, a standard technique in font design which Johnston had not used. The &quot;R&quot; with its widely splayed leg is Gill&#x27;s preferred design, unlike that of Johnston; historian James Mosley has suggested that this may be inspired by an Italian Renaissance carving in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. 
Particular areas of thought during the design process were the &quot;a&quot; (several versions and sizes in the hot metal era had a straight tail like Johnston&#x27;s or a mildly curving tail) and the &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, where some versions (and sizes, since the same weight would not be identical at every size) had stroke ends visible and others did not. Rhatigan has commented that Monotype&#x27;s archives contain &quot;enough [material] for a book just about the &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;d&#x27;, &#x27;p&#x27;, and &#x27;q&#x27; of Gill Sans&quot;.

The titling capitals of Gill Sans were first unveiled at a printing conference in 1928; it was also shown in a specimen issued in the &quot;Fleuron&quot; magazine edited by Morison. While initial response was partly appreciative, it was still considered dubious by some ultra-conservative printers who saw all sans-serif type as modern and unsound; one called it &quot;typographical Bolshevism&quot;. Sans-serifs were still regarded as vulgar and commercial by purists in this period: Johnston&#x27;s pupil Graily Hewitt privately commented of them that: In Johnston I have lost confidence. Despite all he did for us ... he has undone too much by forsaking his standard of the Roman alphabet, giving the world, without safeguard or explanation, his block letters which disfigure our modern life. His prestige has obscured their vulgarity and commercialism. Nonetheless, Gill Sans rapidly became popular after its release.

Gill Sans&#x27; technical production followed Monotype&#x27;s standard method of the period. The characters were drawn mirrored on paper in large plan diagrams by the experienced drawing office team, led and trained by Pierpont and Fritz Steltzer, both of whom Monotype had recruited from the German printing industry. The drawing staff who executed the design was disproportionately female; they worked out many aspects of the final drawings including adaptations of the letters to different sizes and the spacing. The diagrams were then used as a plan for machining metal punches by pantograph to stamp matrices, which would be loaded into a casting machine to cast type. It was Monotype&#x27;s standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs (some of which survive) from them to test overall balance of colour and spacing on the page, before completing the remaining characters. Walter Tracy, Rhatigan and Gill&#x27;s biographer Malcolm Yorke have all written that the drawing office&#x27;s work in making Gill Sans successful has not been fully appreciated; Yorke described Gill as &quot;tactless&quot; in his claims that the design was &quot;as much as possible mathematically measurable ... as little reliance as possible should be placed on the sensibility of the draughtsmen and others concerned in its machine facture&quot;.

===Reception===
Gill Sans rapidly became very popular. Its success was aided by Monotype&#x27;s sophisticated marketing, led by Gill&#x27;s supporter Beatrice Warde, and due to its practicality and availability for machine composition in a very wide range of sizes and weights.

Despite the popularity of Gill Sans, some reviews have been critical. Robert Harling, who knew Gill, wrote in his 1976 anthology examining Gill&#x27;s lettering that the density of the basic weight made it unsuitable for extended passages of text, printing a passage in it as a demonstration. The regular weight has been used to print body text for some trade printing uses such as guides to countryside walks published by the LNER. William Addison Dwiggins described it and Futura as &quot;fine in the capitals and bum in the lower-case&quot; while proposing to create a more individualistic competitor, Metro, for Linotype around 1929. Modern writers, including Stephen Coles and Ben Archer, have criticised it for failing to improve on Johnston and for unevenness of colour, especially in the bolder weights (discussed below). More generally, modern font designer Jonathan Hoefler has criticised Johnston and Gill&#x27;s designs for rigidity, calling their work &quot;products more of the machine than the hand, chilly and austere designs shaped by unbending rules, whose occasional moments of whimsy were so out of place as to feel volatile and disquieting&quot;.

Gill broached the topic of the similarity with Johnston in a variety of ways in his work and writings, writing to Johnston in 1933 to apologise for the typeface bearing his name and describing Johnston&#x27;s work as being important and seminal. However, in his &quot;Essay on Typography&quot;, he proposed that his version was &quot;perhaps an improvement&quot; and more &quot;fool-proof&quot; than Johnston&#x27;s. Johnston and Gill had drifted apart by the beginning of the 1920s, something Gill&#x27;s groundbreaking biographer Fiona MacCarthy describes as partly due to the anti-Catholicism of Johnston&#x27;s wife Greta. Frank Pick, the Underground Electric Railways Company managing director who commissioned Johnston&#x27;s typeface, privately thought Gill Sans &quot;a rather close copy&quot; of Johnston&#x27;s work.
===Expansion and new styles===

Following the initial success of Gill Sans, Monotype rapidly produced a wide variety of other variants. In addition, Monotype sold moulds (matrices) for Gill Sans in very large sizes for their &quot;Supercaster&quot; type-casting equipment. Popular with advertisers, this allowed end-users to cast their own type at a very competitive price. This made it a popular choice for posters. Gill&#x27;s biographer Malcolm Yorke has described it as &quot;the essence of clarity for public notices&quot;.

Versions of Gill Sans were created in a wide range of styles such as condensed and shadowed weights. Several shadowed designs were released, including a capitals-only regular shadowed design and a light-shadowed version with deep relief shadows. In the metal type era, a &#x27;cameo ruled&#x27; design that placed white letters in boxes or against a stippled black background was available. The shadowed weights were intended to be used together with the regular, printing in different colours, to achieve a simple multicolour effect. Some of the decorative versions may predominantly have been designed by the Monotype office, with Gill examining, critiquing and approving the designs sent to him by post. The long series of extensions, redrawings and conversions into new formats of one of Monotype&#x27;s most important assets (extending long beyond Gill&#x27;s death) has left Gill Sans with a great range of alternative designs and releases. A book weight was created in 1993 in between the light and regular weight, suitable for body text, along with a heavy weight.

===Gill Kayo===
In 1936, Gill and Monotype released an extremely bold sans-serif named Gill Kayo (from KO, or knockout, implying its aggressive build). This has often been branded as Gill Sans Ultra Bold, though in practice many letters vary considerably from Gill Sans. Gill, who thought of the design as something of a joke, proposed naming it &quot;Double Elefans&quot;. Harling reviewed it as &quot;dismal&quot; and sarcastically commented that &quot;typographical historians of 2000AD (which isn&#x27;t, after all, so very far away) will find this odd outburst in Mr Gill&#x27;s career, and will spend much time in attempting to track down this sad psychological state of his during 1936.&quot; Forty years later he described it as &quot;the most horrendous and blackguardly of these display exploitations&quot;. The design was begun in 1932; some of the first drawings may have been prepared by Gill&#x27;s son-in-law Denis Tegetmeier. It made a return to popularity in the graphic design of the 1970s and 80s, when Letraset added a condensed weight.

The boldest weights of Gill Sans, including Kayo, have been particularly criticised for design issues such as the eccentric design of the dots on the &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;, and for their extreme boldness. (Gill Sans&#x27; standard weight is, as already noted, already quite bold by modern standards.) Gill argued in his &quot;Essay on Typography&quot; that the nineteenth-century tendency to make sans-serif typefaces attention-grabbingly bold was self-defeating, since the result was compromised legibility. In the closing paragraph he ruefully noted his contribution to the genre: There are now about as many different varieties of letters as there are different kinds of fools. I myself am responsible for designing five different sorts of sans-serif letters – each one thicker and fatter than the last because each advertisement has to try and shout down its neighbours.
===Alternative characters===

Monotype developed a set of alternative characters for Gill Sans to cater for differing tastes and national printing styles of different countries. These include Futura-inspired designs of &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;t&quot; and others, a four-terminal &quot;W&quot; in the French renaissance style, a tighter &quot;R&quot;, a &quot;Q&quot; in the nineteenth-century style with a tail that looped upwards (similar to that on Century among others, and used by the LNER), oblique designs as opposed to the standard true italic, a more curving, true-italic &quot;e&quot; and several alternative numerals. In particular, in the standard designs for Gill Sans the numeral &quot;1&quot;, upper-case &quot;i&quot; and lower-case &quot;L&quot; are all a simple vertical line, so an alternative &quot;1&quot; with a serif was sold for number-heavy situations where this could otherwise cause confusion, such as on price-lists. (Not all timetables used it: for example, the L.N.E.R. used the simple version.) Some early versions of Gill Sans also had features later abandoned, such as an unusual &quot;7&quot; matching the curve of the &quot;9&quot;, a &quot;5&quot; pushing forwards, and a lower-case letter-height &quot;0&quot;.

Gill was involved in the design of these alternatives, and Monotype&#x27;s archive preserves notes that he rethought the geometric alternatives. With the increasing popularity of Futura Gill Sans was not alone in being adapted: both Erbar and Dwiggins&#x27; Metro would undergo what historian Paul Shaw has called a &quot;Futura-ectomy&quot; to conform to taste. After Gill&#x27;s death, Monotype created versions for the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets. Monotype also added additional features not found in the metal type, notably text figures and small capitals.

===Series and styles===
According to Rhatigan and other sources, by the end of the metal type period Gill Sans had been released in the following styles (not all sold at the same time):

Titling series were capitals-only.

===Phototypesetting===
Monotype offered Gill Sans on film in the phototypesetting period. The fonts released in 1961 included Light 362, Series 262, Bold 275, Extra Bold 321, Condensed 343, all of which were released in film matrix sets &quot;A&quot; (6–7 points) and &quot;B&quot; (8–22, 24 points).

===Infant and rounded versions===
Monotype created an infant version of Gill Sans using single-storey &quot;a&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, and other more distinguishable characters such as a rounded &quot;y&quot;, seriffed &quot;1&quot; and lower-case &quot;L&quot; with a turn at the bottom. Infant designs of fonts are often used in education and toys as the letters are thought to be more recognisable to children being based on handwriting, and are often produced to supplement popular families such as Gill Sans, Akzidenz-Grotesk and Bembo. Monotype also created a version with rounded stroke ends for John Lewis for use on toys.
==Digital releases==

The digital releases of Gill Sans fall into several main phases: releases before 2005 (which includes most bundled &quot;system&quot; versions of Gill Sans), the 2005 Pro edition, and the 2015 Nova release which adds many alternative
characters and is in part included with Windows 10. In general characteristics for common weights the designs are similar, but there are some changes: for example, in the book weight the 2005 release used circular ij dots but the 2015 release uses square designs, and the 2015 release simplifies some ligatures. Digital Gill Sans also gained character sets not present in the metal type, including text figures and small capitals.

Like all metal type revivals, reviving Gill Sans in digital form raises several decisions of interpretation, such as the issue of how to compensate for the ink spread that would have been seen in print at small sizes more than larger. As a result, printed Gill Sans and its digital facsimile may not always match. The digital release of Gill Sans, like many Monotype digitisations, has been criticised, in particular for excessively tight letter-spacing and lack of optical sizes: with only one design released that has to be used at any text size, it cannot replicate the subtlety of design and spacing of the metal type, for which every size was drawn differently. In the hot metal era different font sizes varied as is normal for metal type, with wider spacing and other detail changes at smaller text sizes; other major sans-serif families such as Futura and Akzidenz-Grotesk are similar. In the phototype period Monotype continued to offer two or three sizes of master, but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital. To replicate this, it is necessary to make manual adjustment to spacing to compensate for size changes, such as expanding the spacing and increasing the weight used at smaller sizes.

Former ATypI president John Berry commented of Gill Sans&#x27; modernised spacing that &quot;both the regular weight and especially the light weight look much better when they&#x27;re tracked loose&quot;. In contrast, Walter Tracy wrote in 1986 that he preferred the later spacing: &quot;the metal version ... was spaced, I suspect, as if it were a serif face&quot;.

===Gill Sans Nova (2015)===
As of 2019, Monotype&#x27;s current digitisation of Gill Sans is Gill Sans Nova, by George Ryan. Gill Sans Nova adds many additional variants, including some of the previously undigitised inline versions, stylistic alternates and an ultra-light weight which had been drawn for &quot;Grazia&quot;. The fonts differ from Gill Sans MT (MT stands for Monotype) in their adoption of the hooked 1 as default, while the regular weight is renamed &#x27;Medium&#x27;. Monotype celebrated the release with a London exhibition on Gill&#x27;s work, as they had in 1958 to mark the general release of Gill&#x27;s serif design Joanna. One addition was italic swash caps, which had been considered by Gill but never released.

The family includes 43 fonts, including 33 text fonts in 9 weights and 3 widths, 6 inline fonts in 5 weights and 2 widths (1 in condensed), 2 shadowed fonts in 2 weights and 1 width, 1 shadowed outline font, 1 deco font. Characters set support includes W1G. The basic set of Regular, Light and Bold weights is bundled with Windows 10 in the user-downloadable &quot;Pan-European Supplemental Fonts&quot; package.

===Miscellaneous===
Peter Wiegel digitized a modified variant of Gill Sans Bold Condensed that used on road signs in former East Germany until 1990 named TGL 12096-1 typeface.
==Usage==

First unveiled in a single uppercase weight in 1928, Gill Sans achieved national prominence almost immediately, when it was chosen the following year to become the standard typeface by the LNER railway company, soon appearing on every facet of the company&#x27;s identity, from metal locomotive nameplates and hand-painted station signage to printed restaurant car menus, timetables and advertising posters.
The LNER promoted their rebranding by offering Gill (who was fascinated with railway engines) a footplate ride on the &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; express service; he also painted for it a signboard in the style of Gill Sans, which survives in the collection of the St Bride Library.
In 1949 the Railway Executive decided on standard types of signs to be used at all stations. Lettering was to use the Gill Sans typeface on a background of the regional colour. Gill Sans was also used in much of its printed output, very often in capitals-only settings for signage. Specially drawn variations were developed by the Railway Executive (part of the British Transport Commission) for signs in its manual for the use of signpainters painting large signs by hand. Other users included Penguin Books&#x27; iconic paperback jacket designs from 1935 and British official mapping agency Ordnance Survey. It was also used by London Transport for documents which could not be practically set in Johnston. Paul Shaw, a historian of printing, has described it as a key element of the &#x27;Modernist classical&#x27; style from the 1930s to the 1950s, that promoted clean, spare design, often with all-capitals and centred setting of headings.

Gill Sans remains popular, although a trend away from it towards grotesque and neo-grotesque typefaces took place around the 1950s and 1960s under the influence of continental and American design. Typefaces that became popular around this time included original early &quot;grotesque&quot; sans-serifs, as well as new and more elegant designs in the same style such as Helvetica and Univers. Mosley has commented that in 1960 &quot;orders unexpectedly revived&quot; for the old Monotype Grotesque design: &quot;[it] represents, even more evocatively than Univers, the fresh revolutionary breeze that began to blow through typography in the early sixties.&quot; He added in 2007 &quot;its rather clumsy design seems to have been one of the chief attractions to iconoclastic designers tired of the ... prettiness of Gill Sans&quot;. As an example of this trend, Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert&#x27;s corporate rebranding of BR as British Rail in 1965 introduced Helvetica and Univers for printed matter and the custom but very similar Rail Alphabet for signage, and abandoned the classical, all caps signage style with which Gill Sans is often associated. Kinneir and Calvert&#x27;s road signage redesign used a similar approach. Linotype and its designer Hermann Zapf, who had begun development on a planned Gill Sans competitor in 1955, first considered redrawing some letters to make it more like these faces before abandoning the design project (now named &quot;Magnus&quot;) around 1962–3.

An additional development which reduced Gill Sans&#x27; dominance was the arrival of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake&#x27;s Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, when he was growing up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape ... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type ... seemed at last to be happening.

While extremely popular in Britain, and to a lesser extent in European printing, Gill Sans did not achieve popularity with American printers in the hot metal era, with most preferring gothic designs like Franklin Gothic and geometric designs like Futura and Monotype&#x27;s own Twentieth Century. Gill Sans therefore particularly achieved worldwide popularity after the close of the metal type era and in the phototypesetting and digital era, when it became a system font on Macintosh computers and Microsoft Office. One use of Gill&#x27;s work in the United States in this period, however, was a custom wordmark and logo made by Gill for &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine in 1930 based on Gill Sans. Its editor Harriet Monroe had seen Gill&#x27;s work in London.
The BBC adopted the typeface as its corporate typeface in 1997 for many but not all purposes, including on its logo. Explaining the change, designer Martin Lambie-Nairn said that &quot;by choosing a typeface that has stood the test of time, we avoid the trap of going down a modish route that might look outdated in several years&#x27; time&quot;. This was not Gill&#x27;s only association with the BBC, as he had designed sculptures and other artwork that are on display at the broadcaster&#x27;s London headquarters, Broadcasting House. In 2017, the BBC began to phase out Gill Sans in favour of a proprietary corporate font family, &quot;Reith&quot; (named after its first general manager John Reith), which was designed to be more legible on mobile devices, and did not require licensing for continued use. The font was adopted by the BBC&#x27;s corporate logo in 2021.

Former East Germany used a modified variant of Gill Sans Bold Condensed for their road signs prior to the German reunification in 1990.

Until 2022, the charity Save the Children featured Gill Sans in its logo and branding. Following increased publicity of designer Eric Gill&#x27;s sexual abuse of his children and others, the charity rebranded saying that it was &quot;moving away from using the Gill Sans font.&quot;

==Similar fonts==

===Early competitors===

The Sheffield type foundry Stephenson Blake rapidly released a commercial competitor named Granby, influenced by Gill Sans, Johnston and Futura. Granby was a large family with condensed and inline styles; it has a diamond-dot design like Johnston. It also included a &quot;Granby Elephant&quot; weight influenced by Gill Kayo.

Another similar but more eccentric design was created by Johnston&#x27;s student Harold Curwen for the use of his family company, the Curwen Press of Plaistow. Named &quot;Curwen Sans&quot; or &quot;Curwen Modern&quot;, it has many similarities to Johnston also, and was occasionally used by London Transport in work printed by the Curwen Press. Curwen described it as based on his time studying with Johnston in the 1900s, although it was not cut into metal until 1928, around the same time as Gill Sans was released, with a lower-case similar to that of Kabel. A digitisation by K-Type was released in 2018.

Several intended Gill Sans competitors were developed during the period of its popularity but ultimately did not see mass release. Jan Tschichold, who would later make extensive use of Gill Sans while designing books for Penguin, created a similar design for an early phototypesetting machine, which was at the time little-used but also since digitised. During the 1930s Dutch type designer Jan van Krimpen, also a friend of Morison&#x27;s, worked on a superfamily named Romulus, with serif and humanist sans-serif companion: the sans-serif, with a low x-height, never progressed beyond test proofs. As described above, Linotype began work in 1955 on a Gill Sans competitor, intended to be named &#x27;Magnus&#x27;. Designed by the German type designer Hermann Zapf with input from British Linotype manager Walter Tracy, the design was ultimately abandoned by 1963 for reasons of lack of manufacturing capacity and changing tastes, although it too reached test proofs.
Besides similar fonts, many signs and objects made in Britain during the period of Gill Sans&#x27; dominance, such as the &quot;Keep Calm and Carry On&quot; poster, received hand-painted or custom lettering similar to Gill Sans. Fighter Command during the war used a standard set of letters similar to it. Matthew Carter, later a prominent font designer, recalled in 2005 that when his mother cut linoleum block letters for him to play with during the Blitz they were based on it. Another little-known follower was the NEN 3225 standard lettering, a project by the Dutch Standards Institute to create a set of standardised lettering for public use in the Netherlands, comprising a sans-serif similar to Gill Sans and a companion serif font drawn by Jan van Krimpen. The project was begun in 1944 but not published until 1963, and ultimately did not become popular.

===Later and digital-only designs===
The category of humanist sans-serif typefaces, which Gill Sans helped to define, saw great attention during the 1980s and 1990s, especially as a reaction against the overwhelming popularity of Helvetica and Univers in the 1960s and 1970s.

Modern sans-serif designs inspired by Gill often adapt the concept by creating a design better proportioned and spaced for body text, a wider and more homogeneous range of weights, something easier since the arrival of the computer due to the use of multiple master or interpolated font design, or more irregular and hand-drawn in style. Jeremy Tankard&#x27;s Bliss and Volker Küster&#x27;s Today Sans are modern variations; Tankard commented on the genre&#x27;s eclipse that his aim was to create &quot;the first commercial typeface with an English feel since Gill Sans&quot;. Rowton Sans is inspired by Gill but has a nearly upright italic, similar to that used by Gill in his serif font Joanna. More distantly, Arthur Vanson&#x27;s Chesham Sans is inspired by the British tradition of sans-serif signpainting, with many similarities to Gill&#x27;s work. Bitstream&#x27;s Humanist 521 was an unofficial digitisation, to which its Russian licensee ParaType added a Cyrillic version in 1997. The companies SoftMaker and Fontsite also released Gill Sans digitisations under different names including &#x27;Chantilly&#x27;, &#x27;Gibson&#x27; and others.

More loosely, Syntax by Hans Eduard Meier is similar in some ways. Released in 1968 and praised by Tschichold, it was intended to be a more dynamic, handwriting-influenced sans-serif form. Its italic is, however, more of an oblique than Gill&#x27;s. Hypatia Sans, designed by Thomas Phinney and released by Adobe, was intended to be a more characterful humanist sans design. Many other fonts are influenced by Gill Sans to some extent.

===Font superfamilies===

A logical extension of the humanist sans-serif concept is the font superfamily: a serif font and a matching humanist sans-serif with similar letterforms. Martin Majoor&#x27;s FF Scala Sans is a popular example of this influenced by Gill&#x27;s work; others include Charlotte Sans and Serif by Michael Gills for Letraset, Mr and Mrs Eaves by Zuzana Licko, are based on Baskerville, and Dover Sans and serif by Robin Mientjes, based on Caslon. Monotype itself released Joanna Sans in 2015, as a screen-optimised sans-serif font intended to complement (but not exactly match) Gill&#x27;s serif design Joanna.

===Legal aspects===

Typeface designs are in many countries not copyrightable, and in others such as the United Kingdom, the design is out of copyright after the 70 years have passed since Gill&#x27;s death in 1940, when the metal type family had been essentially completed. That makes it legally permissible to create alternative digitised versions of Gill Sans although not necessarily of later Monotype additions to the font such as the book weight and euro sign. However, the name &quot;Gill Sans&quot; remains a Monotype trademark (no. 1340167 in the US) and therefore is not eligible to be used to name any derivative font.

No complete direct open-source Gill Sans clone has yet been released. One of the most extensive is Gillius, a derivative by the Arkandis Digital Foundry project and designer Hirwen Harendal, which includes bold, italic, condensed and condensed bold styles. It is not a pure clone but rather is partly created by modifying Bitstream Vera and adds influences from geometric fonts that are particularly visible in the design of the &quot;w&quot;. K22, a foundry in Quezon City that is operated by the designer &quot;Toto G&quot;, has released two Gill Sans shadowed variants as K22 EricGill Shadow (digitising the Gill Sans Shadow 338 design) and K22 EricGill Shadow Line, an inline variant, for free for &quot;personal, private and non-commercial purposes&quot; and for sale for commercial use. A direct clone of the medium weight, Sans Guilt, was released by Brussels open source design group OSP in 2011, but it contains several obvious glitches such as misaligned &quot;w&quot; and &quot;x&quot; characters.

<text>Veracruz is a state in central eastern Mexico that is divided into 212 municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, it is the fourth most populated state with inhabitants and the 11th largest by land area spanning .

Municipalities in Veracruz are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Every four years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

The largest municipality by population is Veracruz, with 607,209 residents (7.53% of the state&#x27;s total), while the smallest is Landero y Coss with 1,543 residents. The largest municipality by land area is Las Choapas which spans , and the smallest is Oteapan with . The newest municipalities were created in 2003: San Rafael and Santiago Sochiapan.

<text>In linguistics, a determiner phrase (DP) is a type of phrase headed by a determiner such as &quot;many&quot;. Controversially, many approaches take a phrase like &quot;not very many apples&quot; to be a DP, headed, in this case, by the determiner &quot;many&quot;. This is called the DP analysis or the DP hypothesis. Others reject this analysis in favor of the more traditional NP (noun phrase or nominal phrase) analysis where &quot;apples&quot; would be the head of the phrase in which the DP &quot;not very many&quot; is merely a dependent. Thus, there are competing analyses concerning heads and dependents in nominal groups. The DP analysis developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and it is the majority view in generative grammar today.

In the example determiner phrases below, the determiners are in boldface:
* a little dog, the little dogs (indefinite or definite articles)
* my little dog, your little dogs (possessives) 
* this little dog, those little dogs (demonstratives) 
* every little dog, each little dog, no dog (quantifiers)

==The competing analyses==
Although the DP analysis is the dominant view in generative grammar, most other grammar theories reject the idea. For instance, representational phrase structure grammars follow the NP analysis, e.g. Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar, and most dependency grammars such as Meaning-Text Theory, Functional Generative Description, and Lexicase Grammar also assume the traditional NP analysis of noun phrases, Word Grammar being the one exception. Construction Grammar and Role and Reference Grammar also assume NP instead of DP. Noam Chomsky, on whose framework most generative grammar has been built, said in a 2020 lecture, I’m going to assume here that nominal phrases are actually NPs. The DP hypothesis, which is widely accepted, was very fruitful, leading to a lot of interesting work; but I’ve never really been convinced by it. I think these structures are fundamentally nominal phrases. [. . . ] As far as determiners are concerned, like say &quot;that&quot;, I suspect that they are adjuncts. So I’ll be assuming that the core system is basically nominal.The point at issue concerns the hierarchical status of determiners. Various types of determiners in English are summarized in the following table.

Should the determiner in phrases such as &quot;the car&quot; and &quot;those ideas&quot; be construed as the head of or as a dependent in the phrase? The following trees illustrate the competing analyses, DP vs. NP. The two possibilities are illustrated first using dependency-based structures (of dependency grammars):

The a-examples show the determiners dominating the nouns, and the b-examples reverse the relationship, since the nouns dominate the determiners. The same distinction is illustrated next using constituency-based trees (of phrase structure grammars), which are equivalent to the above:

The convention used here employs the words themselves as the labels on the nodes in the structure. Whether a dependency-based or constituency-based approach to syntax is employed, the issue is which word is the head over the other.

==Arguments for DP over NP==

The DP-hypothesis is held for four main reasons: 1) facilitates viewing phrases and clauses as structurally parallel, 2) accounts for determiners often introducing phrases and their fixed position within phrases, 3) accounts for possessive &quot;-s&quot; constructions, and 4) accounts for the behaviour of definite pronouns given their complementary distribution with determiners.

===Parallel structures===

The original motivation for the DP-analysis came in the form of parallelism across phrase and clause. The DP-analysis provides a basis for viewing clauses and phrases as structurally parallel. The basic insight runs along the following lines: since clauses have functional categories above lexical categories, noun phrases should do the same. The traditional NP-analysis has the drawback that it positions the determiner, which is often a pure function word, below the lexical noun, which is usually a full content word. The traditional NP-analysis is therefore unlike the analysis of clauses, which positions the functional categories as heads over the lexical categories. The point is illustrated by drawing a parallel to the analysis of auxiliary verbs. Given a combination such as &quot;will understand&quot;, one views the modal auxiliary verb &quot;will&quot;, a function word, as head over the main verb &quot;understand&quot;, a content word. Extending this type of analysis to a phrase like &quot;the car&quot;, the determiner &quot;the&quot;, a function word, should be head over &quot;car&quot;, a content word. In so doing, the NP &quot;the car&quot; becomes a DP. The point is illustrated with simple dependency-based hierarchies:

Only the DP-analysis shown in c establishes the parallelism with the verb chain. It enables one to assume that the architecture of syntactic structure is principled; functional categories (function words) consistently appear above lexical categories (content words) in phrases and clauses. This unity of the architecture of syntactic structure is perhaps the strongest argument in favor of the DP-analysis.

===Position===

The fact that determiners typically introduce the phrases in which they appear is also viewed as support for the DP-analysis. One points to the fact that when more than one attributive adjective appears, their order is somewhat flexible, e.g. &quot;an old friendly dog&quot; vs. &quot;a friendly old dog&quot;. The position of the determiner, in contrast, is fixed; it has to introduce the phrase, e.g. &quot;*friendly an old dog&quot;, &quot;*old friendly a dog&quot;, etc. The fact that the determiner&#x27;s position at the left-most periphery of the phrase is set is taken as an indication that it is the head of the phrase. The reasoning assumes that the architecture of phrases is robust if the position of the head is fixed. The flexibility of order for attributive adjectives is taken as evidence that they are indeed dependents of the noun.

===Possessive &quot;-s&quot; in English===

Possessive &quot;-s&quot; constructions in English are often produced as evidence in favor of the DP-analysis. The key trait of the possessive &quot;-s&quot; construction is that the &quot;-s&quot; can attach to the right periphery of a phrase. This fact means that &quot;-s&quot; is not a suffix (since suffixes attach to words, not phrases). Further, the possessive &quot;-s&quot; construction has the same distribution as determiners, which means that it has determiner status. The assumption is therefore that possessive &quot;-s&quot; heads the entire DP, e.g.

# [the guy with a hat]&#x27;s dog
# [the girl who was laughing]&#x27;s scarf

The phrasal nature of the possessive &quot;-s&quot; constructions like these is easy to accommodate on a DP-analysis. The possessive &quot;-s&quot; heads the possessive phrase; the phrase that immediately precedes the &quot;-s&quot; (in brackets) is in specifier position, and the noun that follows the &quot;-s&quot; is the complement. The claim is that the NP-analysis is challenged by this construction because it does not make a syntactic category available for the analysis of &quot;-s&quot;, that is, the NP-analysis does not have a clear means at its disposal to grant &quot;-s&quot; the status of determiner. This claim is debatable, however, since nothing prevents the NP-analysis from also granting &quot;-s&quot; the status of determiner. The NP-analysis is however forced to acknowledge that DPs do in fact exist, since possessive &quot;-s&quot; constructions have to be acknowledged as phrases headed by the determiner &quot;-s&quot;. A certain type of DP definitely exists, namely one that has &quot;-s&quot; as its head.

===Definite pronouns===

The fact that definite pronouns are in complementary distribution with determiners is taken as evidence in favor of DP. The important observation in this area is that definite pronouns cannot appear together with a determiner like &quot;the&quot; or &quot;a&quot; in one and the same DP, e.g.

# they
# *the they

# him
# *a him

On a DP-analysis, this trait of definite pronouns is relatively easy to account for. If definite pronouns are actually determiners, then it makes sense that they should not be able to appear together with another determiner since the two would be competing for the same syntactic position in the hierarchy of structure. On an NP-analysis in contrast, there is no obvious reason why a combination of the two would not be possible. In other words, the NP-analysis has to reach to additional stipulations to account for the fact that combinations like &quot;*the them&quot; are impossible. A difficulty with this reasoning, however, is posed by indefinite pronouns (&quot;one&quot;, &quot;few&quot;, &quot;many&quot;), which can easily appear together with a determiner, e.g. &quot;the old one&quot;. The DP-analysis must therefore draw a distinction between definite and indefinite pronouns, whereby definite pronouns are classified as determiners, but indefinite pronouns as nouns.

==Arguments for NP over DP==
While the DP-hypothesis has largely replaced the traditional NP analysis in generative grammar, it is generally not held among advocates of other frameworks, for six reasons: 1) absent determiners, 2) morphological dependencies, 3) semantic and syntactic parallelism, 4) idiomatic expressions, 5) left-branch phenomena, and 6) genitives.

===Absent determiners===
Many languages lack the equivalents of the English definite and indefinite articles, e.g. the Slavic languages. Thus in these languages, determiners appear much less often than in English, where the definite article &quot;the&quot; and the indefinite article &quot;a&quot; are frequent. What this means for the DP-analysis is that null determiners are a common occurrence in these languages. In other words, the DP-analysis must posit the frequent occurrence of null determiners in order to remain consistent about its analysis of DPs. DPs that lack an overt determiner actually involve a covert determiner in some sense. The problem is evident in English as well, where mass nouns can appear with or without a determiner, e.g. &quot;milk&quot; vs. &quot;the milk&quot;, &quot;water&quot; vs. &quot;the water&quot;. Plural nouns can also appear with or without a determiner, e.g. &quot;books&quot; vs. &quot;the books&quot;, &quot;ideas&quot; vs. &quot;the ideas&quot;, etc. Since nouns that lack an overt determiner have the same basic distribution as nouns with a determiner, the DP-analysis should, if it wants to be consistent, posit the existence of a null determiner every time an overt determiner is absent. The traditional NP analysis is not confronted with this necessity, since for it, the noun is the head of the noun phrase regardless of whether a determiner is or is not present. Thus the traditional NP analysis requires less of the theoretical apparatus, since it does not need all those null determiners, the existence of which is non-falsifiable. Other things being equal, less is better according to Occam&#x27;s Razor.

===Morphological dependencies===
The NP-analysis is consistent with intuition in the area of morphological dependencies. Semantic and grammatical features of the noun influence the choice and morphological form of the determiner, not vice versa. Consider grammatical gender of nouns in a language like German, e.g. &quot;Tisch&quot; &#x27;table&#x27; is masculine (&quot;der Tisch&quot;), &quot;Haus&quot; &#x27;house&#x27; is neuter (&quot;das Haus&quot;), &quot;Zeit&quot; &#x27;time&#x27; is feminine (&quot;die Zeit&quot;). The grammatical gender of a noun is an inherent trait of the noun, whereas the form of the determiner varies according to this trait of the noun. In other words, the noun is influencing the choice and form of the determiner, not vice versa. In English, this state of affairs is visible in the area of grammatical number, for instance with the opposition between singular &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; and plural &quot;these&quot; and &quot;those&quot;. Since the NP-analysis positions the noun above the determiner, the influence of the noun on the choice and form of the determiner is intuitively clear: the head noun is influencing the dependent determiner. The DP-analysis, in contrast, is unintuitive because it necessitates that one view the dependent noun as influencing the choice and form of the head determiner.

===Semantic and structural parallelism===
Despite what was stated above about parallelism across clause and DP, the traditional NP-analysis of noun phrases actually maintains parallelism in a way that is destroyed if one assumes DPs. The semantic parallelism that can be obtained across clause and NP, e.g. &quot;He loves water&quot; vs. &quot;his love of water&quot;, is no longer present in the structure if one assumes DPs. The point is illustrated here first with dependency trees:

On the NP-analysis, &quot;his&quot; is a dependent of &quot;love&quot; in the same way that &quot;he&quot; is a dependent of &quot;loves&quot;. The result is that the NP &quot;his love of water&quot; and the clause &quot;He loves water&quot; are mostly parallel in structure, which seems correct given the semantic parallelism across the two. In contrast, the DP analysis destroys the parallelism, since &quot;his&quot; becomes head over &quot;love&quot;. The same point is true for a constituency-based analysis:

These trees again employ the convention whereby the words themselves are used as the node labels. The NP-analysis maintains the parallelism because the determiner &quot;his&quot; appears as specifier in the NP headed by &quot;love&quot; in the same way that &quot;he&quot; appears as specifier in the clause headed by &quot;loves&quot;. In contrast, the DP analysis destroys this parallelism because &quot;his&quot; no longer appears as a specifier in the NP, but rather as head over the noun.

===Idiomatic meaning===
The fixed words of many idioms in natural language include the noun of a noun phrase at the same time that they exclude the determiner. This is particularly true of many idioms in English that require the presence of a possessor that is not a fixed part of the idiom, e.g. &quot;take X&#x27;s time&quot;, &quot;pull X&#x27;s leg&quot;, &quot;dance on X&#x27;s grave&quot;, &quot;step on X&#x27;s toes&quot;, etc. While the presence of the Xs in these idioms is required, the X argument itself is not fixed, e.g. &quot;pull his/her/their/John&#x27;s leg&quot;. What this means is that the possessor is NOT part of the idiom; it is outside of the idiom. This fact is a problem for the DP-analysis because it means that the fixed words of the idiom are interrupted in the vertical dimension. That is, the hierarchical arrangement of the fixed words is interrupted by the possessor, which is not part of the idiom. The traditional NP-analysis is not confronted with this problem, since the possessor appears below the noun. The point is clearly visible in dependency-based structures:

The arrangement of the words in the vertical dimension is what is important. The fixed words of the idiom (in blue) are top-down continuous on the NP-analysis (they form a catena), whereas this continuity is destroyed on the DP-analysis, where the possessor (in green) intervenes. Therefore the NP-analysis allows one to construe idioms as chains of words, whereas on the DP-analysis, one cannot make this assumption. On the DP-analysis, the fixed words of many idioms really cannot be viewed as discernible units of syntax in any way.

===Left branches===
In English and many closely related languages, constituents on left branches underneath nouns cannot be separated from their nouns. Long-distance dependencies are impossible between a noun and the constituents that normally appear on left branches underneath the noun. This fact is addressed in terms of the Left Branch Condition. Determiners and attributive adjectives are typical &quot;left-branch constituents&quot;. The observation is illustrated with examples of topicalization and wh-fronting:

 (1a) &quot;Fred has helpful friends.&quot;
 (1b) &quot;*...and helpful Fred has friends.&quot; 

 (2a) &quot;Sam is waiting for the second train.&quot; 
 (2b) &quot;*...and second Sam is waiting for the train.&quot; 

 (3a) &quot;Susan has our car.&quot;
 (3b) &quot;*Whose does Susan have car?&quot; 

 (4a) &quot;Sam is waiting for the second&quot; train.
 (4b) &quot;*Which is Sam waiting for train?&quot; 

These examples illustrate that with respect to the long-distance dependencies of topicalization and wh-fronting, determiners behave like attributive adjectives. Both cannot be separated from their head noun. The NP-analysis is consistent with this observation because it positions both attributive adjectives and determiners as left-branch dependents of nouns. On a DP-analysis, however, determiners are no longer on left branches underneath nouns. In other words, the traditional NP-analysis is consistent with the fact that determiners behave just like attributive adjectives with respect to long-distance dependencies, whereas the DP-analysis cannot appeal to left branches to account for this behavior because on the DP-analysis, the determiner is no longer on a left branch underneath the noun.

===Genitives===
The NP-analysis is consistent with the observation that genitive case in languages like German can have the option to appear before or after the noun, whereby the meaning remains largely the same, as illustrated with the following examples:

::a. das Haus meines Bruders &#x27;the house of.my brother&#x27;
::b. meines Bruders Haus &#x27;my brother&#x27;s house&#x27;

::a. die Arbeit seines Onkels &#x27;the work of.his uncle&#x27;
::b. seines Onkels Arbeit &#x27;his uncle&#x27;s work&#x27;

While the b-phrases are somewhat archaic, they still occur on occasion in elevated registers. The fact that the genitive NPs &quot;meines Bruders&quot; and &quot;seines Onkels&quot; can precede or follow the noun is telling, since it suggests that the hierarchical analysis of the two variants should be similar in a way that accommodates the almost synonymous meanings. On the NP-analysis, these data are not a problem because in both cases, the genitive expression is a dependent of the noun. The DP-analysis, in contrast, is challenged because in the b-variants, it takes the genitive expression to be head over the noun. In other words, the DP-analysis has to account for the fact that the meaning remains consistent despite the quite different structures across the two variants.

<text>Diva Records was an American record label from 1925 to 1932 that sold records through W. T. Grant retail stores. It was a division of Columbia Records.

Artists on the label included Irving Kaufman, Annette Hanshaw, The Golden Gate Orchestra, Sammy Fain, &quot;Hobo&quot; Jack Turner, Walter Cummins, The Broadway Bellhops, Tom Clines, Ed Blossom, The Harmonians, The Royal Troubadours, The Bar Harbor Society Orchestra, Gay Ellis, Tommy Weir, Buck Wilson, Jack Albin and His Hotel Pennsylvania Music, and Vernon Dalhart.

Diva Records were acoustic through early 1929. The audio fidelity of the post-acoustic records, as well as the pressing quality is above average for the era.

<doc id="325393" wikidata="Q716899" url="?curid=325393" title="Mike Jackson (British Army officer)">
<text>General Sir Michael David Jackson, (21 March 1944 – 15 October 2024) was a British Army officer and one of its most high-profile generals since the Second World War. Originally commissioned into the Intelligence Corps in 1963, he transferred to the Parachute Regiment in 1970, with which he served two of his three tours of duty in Northern Ireland. On his first, he was present as an adjutant at the events of the Ballymurphy massacre (1971), where eleven unarmed civilians were shot dead by British troops, and then at Bloody Sunday in 1972, when British soldiers opened fire on unarmed protesters, killing fourteen. On his second, he was a company commander in the aftermath of the Warrenpoint ambush (1979), when the IRA killed 18 soldiers with two roadside bombs, the British Army&#x27;s heaviest single loss of life during the Troubles. He was assigned to a staff post at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in 1982 before assuming command of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, in 1984. Jackson was posted to Northern Ireland for the third time, as a brigade commander, in the early 1990s.

In 1995–1996, Jackson served his first tour in the Balkans, where he commanded a multi-national division of the Implementation Force. Following a staff job in the UK, he was appointed commander of NATO&#x27;s Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) in 1997. He returned to the Balkans with the ARRC during the Kosovo War, during which he famously refused to obey an order from American General Wesley Clark, his immediate superior in the NATO chain of command, to block the runways of Pristina Airport and isolate the Russian contingent that was positioned there. He reportedly told Clark, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to start the Third World War for you&quot;. The incident attracted controversy, particularly in the United States, and earned Jackson the nickname &quot;Macho Jacko&quot; in the British tabloid press. Jackson established a working relationship with the Russian general commanding the detachment at Pristina, giving him a bottle of whisky, of which Jackson was known to be fond, and providing the Russians with the protection of a squad of British soldiers, commanded by his son, Mark.

Upon his return to the UK, Jackson was promoted to full general and appointed Commander-in-Chief, Land Command, the second-most senior position in the British Army. After three years as Commander-in-Chief, Jackson was appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the professional head of the British Army, in 2003. He took up the post a month before the start of the Iraq War, amid disputes over the legality of the invasion and claims that the Army was under-equipped. However, he dismissed suggestions that the Army was at &quot;breaking point&quot;. The most controversial point of his tenure as CGS was the restructuring of the regiment system and amalgamation of many regiments into larger ones, leading to the loss of historic regiment names. He was succeeded as CGS by General Sir Richard Dannatt in 2006, and retired from the Army after serving for almost 45 years.

==Early life==
Jackson&#x27;s father, George, served as a soldier in the Household Cavalry before being commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps. On D-Day, George Jackson assumed command of a squadron of amphibious landing vehicles after his commanding officer was killed in action, and he was later awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre and mentioned in despatches for his actions. Jackson was born at his mother&#x27;s home in Sheffield on 21 March 1944. After the Second World War, George Jackson was eventually posted to Tripoli, Libya, where the family lived for two years, during which time Jackson&#x27;s younger sister was born. After suffering a heart attack, George retired with the rank of major after 40 years in the Army. Jackson&#x27;s mother, Ivy (née Bower), was a curator at a museum in Sheffield.

Jackson was educated at various primary schools as the family moved with his father&#x27;s postings before being sent to Stamford School, an independent boarding school in south Lincolnshire, where he became a house prefect. He joined the school&#x27;s Combined Cadet Force along with John Drewienkiewicz, who eventually became a major general. By the age of 15 Jackson had decided that he wanted to be a soldier.

==Early military career==

Despite being advised by the headmaster at Stamford to consider university, Jackson applied to join the British Army in 1961. He was accepted, and started at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, in January 1962, graduating on 20 December 1963. While at Sandhurst, he became increasingly interested in the Parachute Regiment, but eventually applied to, and was commissioned into, the Intelligence Corps as a second lieutenant at the age of 19. After his commissioning, Jackson took up an opportunity offered by the Intelligence Corps to undertake platoon commanders&#x27; training with a combat regiment, and opted to do so with the Parachute Regiment. Before leaving Sandhurst, he had applied to take an &quot;in-service degree&quot;, a degree sponsored by the Army at a civilian university, and was accepted to read Russian studies at the University of Birmingham. The course required students to reside in the USSR for several months; as the Ministry of Defence refused to allow Jackson to travel to the country, the university agreed to waive the requirement. Jackson returned to the army after graduation as a Bachelor of Social Sciences in Russian Language and Literature in 1967. His first promotion was to lieutenant on 20 June 1965, and he served with the Parachute Regiment in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Anguilla—where he served as adjutant when his battalion relieved the force sent to restore order during the 1969 emergency—after which he was promoted to the rank of captain. Following Anguilla, his tenure with the Parachute Regiment ended and he reluctantly returned to the Intelligence Corps. He became increasingly determined to rejoin the Parachute Regiment and, after almost a year, was eventually allowed to transfer, retaining the rank of captain in 1970.

Jackson went on to serve in Northern Ireland as adjutant to 1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (1 PARA), and was present at the events of the Ballymurphy massacre, where 11 unarmed civilians were shot dead by British troops in August 1971 and at the events of Bloody Sunday, 30 January 1972, when 14 unarmed civilian civil rights protesters were shot dead by soldiers from 1 PARA in Derry. He was in the tactical headquarters of the Army&#x27;s operation to contain the protests immediately before the Bloody Sunday shooting began and he accompanied the battalion commander, Derek Wilford, when Wilford decided to join the soldiers on the ground. The shooting was over by the time Jackson reached the soldiers&#x27; position, but he recalls seeing several bodies in the back of an Army vehicle. In 1976, he was promoted to major and attended the Staff College, Camberley, before being posted to Germany as chief of staff to the Berlin Infantry Brigade. After Berlin, Jackson served his second tour of duty in Northern Ireland, this time as a company commander. While there, he witnessed the aftermath of the 1979 Warrenpoint ambush, the British Army&#x27;s single largest loss of life during The Troubles. He acted as the incident commander, arriving on the scene shortly after the second explosion, and had to identify Major Peter Fursman, a close friend, from the remains of Fursman&#x27;s face, which had been blown clear of his skull. He later spoke of the effect the incident had on him, saying, &quot;It greatly disturbed me. Still does&quot;. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1979 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours and was mentioned in despatches in 1981, in recognition of his service in Northern Ireland.

Having attended the National Defence College, Jackson joined the directing staff at the Army Staff College and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1981. He served as a member of the directing staff at the Staff College, Camberley, for two and a half years. During his tenure at Camberley, he was seconded to a staff position at the Ministry of Defence in 1982 during the Falklands War, and thus missed the opportunity to serve in the conflict directly. He took command of 1 PARA in March 1984, who, at the time, were deployed in Norway, training for the possibility of a Soviet attack. Concerned that he was insufficiently prepared for the weather conditions, he left Camberley early to train with the Royal Marines. He was appointed Senior Directing Staff (Army) at the Joint Service Defence College from 1986 to 1988 and was promoted to colonel in 1987.

While serving as a colonel, Jackson considered resigning his commission. He wondered if he had missed his chance for promotion to brigadier at the age of 44, and believed he might have &quot;reached [his] ceiling&quot; as it was unusual for older officers to be selected for promotion. He was persuaded to try again the next year and was promoted to brigadier on 31 December 1989, after spending six months on a Service Fellowship writing a paper on the future of the Army and taking the Higher Command and Staff Course. He went on to serve his third tour in Northern Ireland, commanding 39 Infantry Brigade—a post he held until 1992, thus missing the Gulf War. He was promoted from Member to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1992.

==High command==
Jackson attained general officer status with promotion to acting major general in May 1992, after holding only one post as a brigadier; in peacetime, senior officers are normally expected to have held two posts before promotion. He was appointed Director General Personal Services (Army) at the Ministry of Defence, reporting to the Adjutant General. He was granted the substantive rank of major general in June 1992, with his promotion backdated to October 1991. After two years at the MoD, Jackson took command of the 3rd Mechanised Division in April 1994. During the Yugoslav Wars in 1995, Jackson had been due to succeed Rupert Smith as commander of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), which would have entailed early promotion to lieutenant general (three-star rank) and a blue beret, signifying UN command. As a result of the Dayton Agreement, however, UNPROFOR became the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR), and Jackson remained a major general (two-star rank), commanding the 3rd Division and troops from several other countries who made up Multinational Division South-West. Jackson retained command of the 3rd Division until July 1996 and went on to serve briefly in a staff post as the Army&#x27;s Director General of Development and Doctrine. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in November 1996.

After he was appointed Commander of NATO&#x27;s Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), Jackson was promoted to acting lieutenant general in January 1997, a rank he was granted substantively in April 1997. Jackson served in the NATO chain of command, reporting to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, American four-star General Wesley Clark. Under Jackson&#x27;s command, the ARRC deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina in March 1999, where Jackson served his second tour of duty in the Balkans, commanding KFOR, NATO&#x27;s multi-national peacekeeping force established at the end of the Kosovo War. He gained significant media attention in June 1999 after a confrontation with Clark in which he backed Captain James Blunt&#x27;s refusal to block the runways of the Russian-occupied Pristina Airport and isolate the Russian troops there, thus preventing them from flying in reinforcements. In one heated discussion with Clark, Jackson reputedly told him &quot;I&#x27;m not going to start the Third World War for you&quot;. He later told the BBC he believed that obeying the order would have led to the possibility of an armed confrontation with Russian troops, which he felt was not &quot;the right way to start off a relationship with Russians&quot;. The point became moot when the US government prevailed upon neighbouring countries, including Hungary and Romania, to prevent Russian use of their airspace to fly in reinforcements. Jackson was criticised for his actions by American military officers and politicians, including General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who called the incident &quot;troubling&quot;, and Senator John Warner, who accused Jackson of insubordination.
As a result of the incident at Pristina Airport, Jackson was dubbed &quot;Macho Jacko&quot; by the British press. Among his troops, Jackson was christened &quot;Darth Vader&quot; and &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;, owing to his temper and gravelly voice. Following the confrontation with Clark, Jackson went to the airport to meet Viktor Zavarzin, the Russian general leading the detachment, and established a working relationship with him. Jackson, who was fond of whisky and cigars, discovered that the Russian troops were apprehensive about being attacked by the Kosovo Liberation Army, and promised to protect the Russians by sending a detachment of British soldiers commanded by his son Mark, along with a bottle of whisky. Jackson was knighted when he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1998, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in 1999 for his leadership in Kosovo.

Upon his return to the British chain of command in early 2000, he assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief, Land Command, the second-highest position in the British Army, and a post which entailed promotion to full general and membership of the Army Board. As Commander-in-Chief, Jackson was responsible for assembling forces for the 2000 British intervention in Sierra Leone, which included Brigadier David Richards—later Chief of the Defence Staff—and Jackson&#x27;s son Mark. He also handled requests from the civilian authorities for assistance with the foot-and-mouth disease crisis, floods and strikes by firefighters and fuel tanker drivers. While still Commander-in-Chief, he stood in for the Chief of the General Staff, marching behind the coffin at the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in 2002. At the time of the 11 September 2001 attacks, Jackson was on a visit to the British training facility in Alberta, Canada. He managed to return to the UK the next day aboard a casualty evacuation aircraft and had overall responsibility for force generation for the British Army&#x27;s contribution to the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

===Chief of the General Staff===

Jackson succeeded General Sir Michael Walker as Chief of the General Staff (CGS)—the professional head of, and highest post in, the British Army—on 1 February 2003, just over a month before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He later said that he &quot;did his homework&quot; in researching the disputed legality of the war and had convinced himself that the invasion was legal. Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, Jackson ordered an inquiry into the alleged abuse of Iraqi prisoners by British soldiers. He admitted that the allegations had damaged the Army&#x27;s reputation, but believed that further damage would be done by covering them up. Several soldiers were eventually convicted in connection with the abuse, after which Jackson publicly apologised on behalf of the British Army and promised to appoint an officer to determine what lessons needed to be learnt. Weeks after becoming CGS, Jackson was summoned to give evidence before the Bloody Sunday Inquiry.

The most controversial action of Jackson&#x27;s tenure as CGS was the Army&#x27;s modernisation of the regimental structure in 2004, in which many regiments were merged to form larger ones. The amalgamations led to the loss of many regimental names, including the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, which became part of The Rifles and the Black Watch, which, after intervention by Queen Elizabeth II, retained its name but became a battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. Jackson insisted that the change was necessary to give the Army greater flexibility and capability, but said he was &quot;acutely aware that this will be sad and unwelcome news for at least some of the infantry&quot;. As part of the same review, the arms plot system, which kept infantry units moving around every few years, was also phased out as being inefficient.

During the Iraq War Jackson admitted that the war was putting the service under strain, but called the claim that the Army was &quot;at breaking point&quot;, &quot;nonsense&quot;. Jackson was dismissive of claims that the Army was under-equipped, recalling his conversation with a soldier: &quot;There&#x27;s a bit of a fuss going on about boots and bog rolls and whatnot. Are you all right for boots?&quot; He later conceded that this could be seen as &quot;cavalier&quot;, and that he &quot;had no intention of belittling the gravity of the situation&quot;, but that he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to send a message to the enemy that we were in any way not ready&quot;. Known for speaking his mind, Jackson attracted media attention towards the end of his tenure as CGS in 2006, when he criticised Norman Kember for his apparent lack of gratitude to the soldiers who freed him from Iraqi kidnappers.

Jackson was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in December 2004 in the New Year Honours List. His investiture took place immediately after the awarding of the Victoria Cross to Johnson Beharry, as the VC takes precedence over all other awards. Speaking of Beharry&#x27;s award, Jackson said he had &quot;never felt more proud of the British Army&quot;, and following the investiture said that he was &quot;overshadowed&quot; by Beharry, &quot;and quite rightly so—it was an honour to stand alongside him&quot;. He was present at the 2006 Sovereign&#x27;s Parade at RMA Sandhurst, in which Prince Harry was commissioned—the first Sovereign&#x27;s Parade to be attended by Elizabeth II in 15 years. One of the most high-profile British Army generals since the Second World War, Jackson was succeeded as Chief of the General Staff by Sir Richard Dannatt and retired from active service in August 2006 after almost 45 years of service.

===Honorary roles===
Jackson held a number of honorary and ceremonial positions in various regiments. His first was as Honorary Colonel, 10 (Volunteer) Battalion, The Parachute Regiment in 1994, which he relinquished in 1999. In 1998 he was appointed Colonel Commandant of the Parachute Regiment, until he was relieved by Sir John Reith in 2004, and Colonel Commandant, Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps, succeeding Sir Jeremy Mackenzie, until he was relieved by Sir Freddie Viggers in 2005.

He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Territorial Army&#x27;s 2nd Battalion (Volunteers) The Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment, in 1997. Following their amalgamation in the modernisation of the regimental structure, Jackson was appointed to the newly created position of Honorary Colonel, the Rifle Volunteers, in 1999. He was given the title of Aide de Camp General (ADC) to Queen Elizabeth II in 2001, succeeding Sir Rupert Smith. He relinquished the appointment in 2006. After Jackson&#x27;s retirement from the Army, he was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of Wiltshire (DL) in 2007.

==Retirement==
Jackson retired in 2006. He spent nearly 45 years in the Army but called it &quot;a regret&quot; that he never fought in a conventional battle, having been in a staff position in 1982 during the Falklands War and having served as a brigade commander in Northern Ireland during the Gulf War. He said that &quot;Fighting is what a young man with good red blood in his veins joins for. It is the ultimate test for the professional soldier&quot;. He continued to voice opinions on military matters in his retirement. He delivered the annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture four months after leaving the Army. In the lecture, titled &quot;The Defence of The Realm in the 21st Century&quot;, he criticised the Ministry of Defence and questioned the MoD&#x27;s understanding of the fundamental ethos of the armed forces. He was critical of the treatment of soldiers, calling some soldiers&#x27; accommodation &quot;frankly shaming&quot; and saying that the &quot;Armed Forces&#x27; contract with the nation ... must be a two-way one&quot;, going on to say that &quot;military operations cost in blood and treasure, because risk-free soldiering, which some seem to think is possible, is simply a contradiction in terms&quot;. The MoD responded by saying that &quot;while we do not agree with everything Sir Mike has said, we are always the first to recognise—for example in relation to medical services and accommodation—that although we have delivered real improvements, there is more we can do&quot;.
At the end of 2006 Jackson took up a consultancy job with PA Consulting Group, and he gave lectures on leadership. He also serves as a non-executive director for ForceSelect and security company Legion and was a member of Rolls-Royce&#x27;s International Advisory Board. His autobiography, &quot;Soldier&quot;, was published in 2007 by Transworld. Gary Sheffield, writing in &quot;The Independent&quot;, called the book &quot;an engaging and honest account that would repay reading by all those who seek to understand the 21st-century British Army&quot;, but Peter Beaumont, foreign affairs editor for &quot;The Observer&quot;, called it &quot;disappointing&quot; and commented that &quot;in the end it is Jackson&#x27;s opinions ... rather than any powerful new detail that emerges&quot;. He suspected that the book had been heavily edited by the army&#x27;s lawyers. Determined to keep active in retirement, Jackson recalled advice he had been given by a friend—&quot;whatever you do, don&#x27;t settle for pruning the roses or soon enough you&#x27;ll be pushing them up&quot;. He appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s series &quot;Great Lives&quot;, along with Major General Julian Thompson, RM, in 2008 and nominated Field Marshal Bill Slim. Jackson sat on the Board of Trustees of the John Smith Memorial Trust, a charity set up in 1995 in memory of the late Labour party leader John Smith.

Jackson re-appeared in the headlines when he and other retired generals, including Major General Tim Cross, who was involved in the planning effort and later commanded all British troops in Iraq, criticised the American post-war planning for Iraq and attacked the statement by Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense, at the time of the invasion, that the US does not &quot;do nation-building&quot;, calling it &quot;nonsensical&quot; and &quot;intellectually bankrupt&quot;. Jackson also joined criticism of the British National Party (BNP) in the midst of the 2009 controversy surrounding party leader Nick Griffin&#x27;s appearance on the panel show &quot;Question Time&quot;. He accused the BNP of &quot;hijacking&quot; military symbols, saying &quot;the BNP is claiming that it has a better relationship with the Armed Forces than other political parties. How dare they use the image of the Army, in particular, to promote their policies?&quot; He elaborated that it was not a party political issue, but an issue of the armed forces&#x27; reputation. Griffin retaliated by calling Jackson and Sir Richard Dannatt &quot;war criminals&quot;. A disagreement between Jackson and then Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth made headlines in 2009, when Ainsworth stated that the UK could only manage a small increase to troop numbers in Afghanistan, saying that the Army had pushed &quot;too hard&quot; when it was engaged in operation in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Jackson countered by saying that the UK should play a decisive role and that the drawdown of troops from Iraq meant the UK had the capability for a larger increase.

After the Saville Report published its findings in June 2010, Jackson gave an interview in which he joined the Prime Minister, David Cameron in offering a &quot;fulsome apology&quot; for the events. He acknowledged that troops of the First Parachute Battalion, of which he was adjutant, had killed people &quot;without justification&quot;, but went on to observe that &quot;Northern Ireland is a very different place [in 2010], not least because of sacrifices made&quot; by the soldiers who had served there, and asked that the report &quot;be seen in this context&quot;.

In 2019 Jackson was a contributor to the British documentary series &quot;Rise of the Nazis&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Jackson married while at university in 1966. The marriage produced two children (Amanda and Mark) before ending in a divorce in the early 1980s. He married again in 1985, to Sarah (née Coombe), whom he met when they debated the Falklands War at a dinner party in 1984. The couple had a son, Tom, in 1990. Jackson&#x27;s daughter Amanda is a mother of four. Mark Jackson joined the Army and served under his father&#x27;s command in Kosovo.

Jackson was well known for having large bags under his eyes, which he had surgically removed shortly after his retirement. He stated that it was a matter of &quot;vision, not vanity&quot;, as the bags had been impairing his sight. Jackson listed his interests as music, reading, travel, skiing, and tennis. He was also known for his rich, gravelly voice, described as &quot;fine-tuned by whisky and cheroots&quot;.

Jackson died from prostate cancer on 15 October 2024, at the age of 80.

<text>Shea Matthew Hillenbrand (born July 27, 1975) is an American former professional baseball third baseman and first baseman, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox, Arizona Diamondbacks, Toronto Blue Jays, San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and Los Angeles Dodgers.

==Minor league career==
Hillenbrand played 72 games in 1996 for the Low-A Lowell Spinners in the New York–Penn League. In 1997, he was promoted to the Sarasota Red Sox of the Florida State League, and was promoted again after 57 games, finishing the season with 64 games with the Michigan Battle Cats of the Midwest League. Despite being drafted as a shortstop, he played at first base and third base his first two years in the minors.

In 1998, still with Michigan, he was converted to play catcher and responded with his best season in the minors, with a .349 batting average and 19 home runs. This earned him a promotion in 1999 to AA Trenton Thunder of the Eastern League. However, a leg injury restricted him to only 69 games.

==Major League career==
The 2000 season saw Hillenbrand back at Trenton, now back to playing first base and third base as the injury prevented him from catching. An average season at age 25 did not bode well for his chances as a prospect, but he parlayed an invitation to spring training with the Red Sox in 2001 into a spot on the big-league team for opening day. Hillenbrand played 139 games for the Sox in his rookie season, mostly at third base, but a .263 batting average failed to hide his failure to hit with power and reach base adequately (he had one of the lowest walks-to-plate appearances rates in MLB). In 2001, he had the lowest range factor among all AL third basemen (2.46).

However, he retained his spot on the roster for 2002, and responded with a much better season, hitting 20 home runs with a .330 on-base percentage and a .459 slugging average. Hillenbrand&#x27;s play earned him the starting third base spot in the All-Star Game. He tied Robin Ventura for the Major League lead in errors by a third baseman, however, with 23.

Nevertheless, Hillenbrand entered 2003 the subject of trade rumors. The Red Sox had signed free agent Bill Mueller, another third baseman, and many believed that Hillenbrand&#x27;s lack of strike zone judgment would not be compatible with the on-base percentage priorities of the new Sox general manager Theo Epstein. With Mueller hitting around .380 and playing a solid third base, Hillenbrand became expendable and was sent to Arizona for pitcher Byung-hyun Kim on May 29.

He finished the season with a combined .280 batting average and career highs in RBIs (97) and home runs (20), including a three-homer game with the Diamondbacks in July. Mueller went on to win the AL Batting Title.

In 2004, Hillenbrand hit a career-high .310 with 15 home runs and 80 RBIs over 148 games. At the same time, he shared the Major League lead in errors for a first baseman, with 13. He was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays at the end of the 2004 season.

In 2005, his first year with the Blue Jays, Hillenbrand hit .291 with 18 home runs and 82 RBIs over 152 games, while splitting time between 1B, 3B, and DH. He also led the league in being hit by pitches (HBP) in 2005 with 22 a mark that remains a Blue Jays club record.

On July 19, 2006, Hillenbrand criticized the Blue Jays organization for failing to congratulate him on his recent adoption of a baby girl and not playing him upon his return. He was also disgruntled about sharing first base duties with Lyle Overbay and third base duties with Troy Glaus while being made to play as a designated hitter. Hillenbrand refused to sit with his team in the dugout during that night&#x27;s game. After the game, an argument in the clubhouse took place between Hillenbrand and manager John Gibbons over Hillenbrand allegedly writing negative comments about the team on the clubhouse billboard (&quot;This is a sinking ship&quot; and &quot;Play for yourself&quot;) after batting practice. This led to a confrontation between Hillenbrand and Gibbons, during which Gibbons told Hillenbrand that he would never play another game for the Blue Jays as long as he was manager. He threatened to resign if the front office sided with Hillenbrand. When general manager J. P. Ricciardi learned about the incident, he sided with Gibbons and agreed that Hillenbrand had to go.

Hillenbrand was designated for assignment that same evening, with the club citing irreconcilable differences. Two days later, Hillenbrand was traded to the San Francisco Giants with reliever Vinnie Chulk in exchange for reliever Jeremy Accardo. One baseball analyst called the deal a &quot;heist&quot; for Toronto, describing Hillenbrand as &quot;clubhouse poison&quot;. Hillenbrand later admitted to writing the comments on the board. After his playing career was over, Hillenbrand said he owed Gibbons an apology, while discussing his own mental problems he had suffered as a player.

Hillenbrand signed a one-year contract with the Angels on December 26, 2006. On June 27, 2007, he was designated for assignment a day after being quoted as saying, &quot;If I&#x27;m not going to play here, give me enough respect to trade me or get rid of me.&quot; On July 9, having been replaced by the emergence of Reggie Willits and first baseman Casey Kotchman, Hillenbrand was waived by the Angels.

He signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres on July 27, 2007. He spent 12 days with the Padres&#x27; Class-AAA affiliate, the Portland Beavers, before being released on August 8. He hit .147 during that span. He signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 10. He was called up to the Major Leagues on August 13. He hit his only home run with the Dodgers on August 29 off Luis Ayala of the Washington Nationals.

In 2008, Hillenbrand went unsigned by any major league organization, only being contacted by the San Francisco Giants during the off season. On July 2, 2008, the York Revolution of the independent Atlantic League announced that they had signed Hillenbrand to be their starting third baseman. Hillenbrand played in 36 games for the Revolution, hitting .340 with two home runs and 25 RBIs before his season was ended by a hamstring injury.

Hillenbrand returned briefly to baseball after a four-year layoff, playing for the Bridgeport Bluefish of the independent Atlantic League during the 2012 season. With Bridgeport, he batted .194 in 29 games.

==Personal life==
Hillenbrand has three adopted children from his first marriage, Austin, Dakota, and Noah. Hillenbrand got married for the second time in 2014. Through his second marriage, Hillenbrand has two stepchildren.

Hillenbrand used to reside on a ranch in Chandler, Arizona where he and his first wife used to run a foundation called Against All Odds. The foundation rescued and rehabilitated animals and allowed underprivileged inner-city kids to visit and interact with the animals.

The ranch went into foreclosure in 2012, and the foundation ceased operations shortly afterwards.

Hillenbrand and his second wife appeared in the &quot;House Hunters International&quot; episode “Puerto Penasco Three-Run Homer” on November 23, 2017, looking for a vacation home in Puerto Penasco, and the following year in the episode &quot;Hitting a Homer in Phoenix.&quot;

In a text chat with baseball fans on the MLB Trade Rumors site on January 28, 2022, Hillenbrand talked about changing his life after the problems and deep unhappiness he had while being a major league ballplayer.

<doc id="325400" wikidata="Q19278424" url="?curid=325400" title="Domino Records (1924)">
<text>Domino Records was an American record label, in existence from 1924 to 1933.
Domino Records, a United States–based label, was in business from 1924 to 1933, producing standard 10-inch lateral cut 78s. The label was formed as Domino Record Company, a subsidiary of Plaza Music Company, headquartered in New York City. The first issues appeared on the market in April or May 1924, and were announced to the trade press June of that year. Initially the records were pressed on red shellac, as an alternative to Regal and Banner which were standard black. For its first year Domino was priced more cheaply than either Banner or Regal, but in 1925 the prices of the latter two was dropped to 35 cents in order to be equal to Domino. In 1927 Domino records were switched to black shellac towards the latter part of the year.

At Plaza&#x27;s takeover by the American Record Corporation, its trademarks passed to that company, and Domino was one of the labels that were weeded out at the time, production ceasing in 1930. ARC reconstituted the Domino label in 1932 – this time with the same label style, but in black ink on gold – for an exclusive 100 series sold only through juke box manufacturers the John Gabel Company. This format lasted until 1933. This gold label series is fairly rare; it&#x27;s possible that this special series was started as Regal&#x27;s short-lived final 100 series.

Artists Plaza recorded included the standard pool of New York studio orchestras led by Sam Lanin, Fred Rich, and others, as well as a handful of name bands like Ben Pollack and Cab Calloway, who also appeared on other Plaza labels such as Banner and Perfect. Recordings by the Original New Orleans Jazz Band appear on Domino.

Initial recordings were mainly sourced from Plaza, and some were sourced from New York Recording Laboratories. Early research had indicated that some recordings were made for Domino&#x27;s exclusive use, but subsequent investigation revealed that Regal&#x27;s matrices had merely been re-numbered for Domino.

<doc id="325410" wikidata="Q164467" url="?curid=325410" title="Little gull">
<text>The little gull (Hydrocoloeus minutus), is a species of gull belonging to the family Laridae which is mainly found in the Palearctic with some colonies in North America. It breeds on freshwaters and spends winters at sea. It is the smallest species of gull in the world and the only species in the monospecific genus Hydrocoloeus.

==Taxonomy==
The little gull was first formally described as &quot;Larus minutus&quot; in 1776 by the German ornithologist Peter Simon Pallas with its type locality given as Berezovo, Tobolsk in Siberia. In 1829, Johann Jakob Kaup proposed the genus Hydrocoloeus for this species and George Robert Gray formally designated &quot;Larus minutus&quot; as the type species of the genus. &quot;Hydrocoloeus minutus&quot; is the binomial accepted for this species and it is classified in the family Laridae, the gulls and terns, within the order Charadriiformes.

==Etymology==
The little gull has genus name &quot;Hydrocoloeus&quot; which is from Ancient Greek , &quot;water&quot;, and , a sort of web-footed bird. The specific is Latin for &quot;small&quot;.

==Description==
The little gull has a body length of and a wing span of , making it the smallest gull species in the world. The adults in breeding plumage have a black hood, dark red bill, bright red legs and a rosy flush to the underside. In non-breeding plumage the adults have a black cap and spot on the ear, white underparts, a black bill and the red on the legs is duller. In all plumages the adults have a pale grey back and upperwings with white primaries contrasting with very dark grey underwing. The juveniles have large areas of blackish colour on the back and head and in flight they have a dark &quot;w&quot; pattern on the upperwings with white underwings. By their first winter the head and body are similar to those of an adult but the upperwing pattern is retained. By their second year they have become very similar to the adults but have some black primary feathers.

==Distribution==
The little gull has a wide Palearctic distribution breeding from northern Scandinavia and the eastern Baltic Sea to eastern Siberia. They also breed in North America around the Great Lakes. It is a migratory species which winters along the coasts of Europe as far south as the Mediterranean, Black and Caspian Seas. They are uncommon in the western Pacific. In North America they winter along the Atlantic coasts in small numbers, as far south as the Carolinas. In the early 21st Century non-breeding birds have summered in western Europe in increasing numbers and in 2016 they successfully nested for the first time in Great Britain at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds reserve at Loch of Strathbeg reserve in Aberdeenshire.

==Habitat==
The little gull nests in areas of dense vegetation where there are emergent or plants with floating leaves in shallow freshwater bodies, slow-moving rivers, marshes and bogs, occasionally using costal lagoons or other brackish water habitats. When it is migrating this species is coastal but may be found inland in some conditions. They also winter on the coast where there are sand and mud substrates and at river mouths and even out to sea. They may be attracted to sewage outfalls.

==Biology==
The little gull is a migratory species with separate breeding and wintering ranges. They typically arrive at their breeding areas from late-April up to late May and start to move away from the breeding areas from the middle of July. Laying eggs begins in mid-June and they commonly nest among other species of gull and tern to form mixed colonies, although some pairs will nest singly away from colonies. Away from the breeding areas this is a sociable species and feeds and loafs in flocks. These flocks can be very large and may number of thousands of birds if bad weather forces them into sheltered waters. The nests are situated on the ground or on the water, floating on leaves and fixed to emergent vegetation and are spaced at distances of from each other in colonies.

Breeding birds are insectivores and feed on a variety of insects caught on the wing close to the water and in winter the diet is dominated by small fish and marine invertebrates.

<text>Mujer, Casos de la Vida Real (translated: &quot;Woman, Real Life Cases&quot;) is an anthology telenovela produced by Mexican television network Televisa for Canal de las Estrellas. Developed as a response to the Mexican earthquake of 1985, the program initially consisted of reenactments of real-life situations, or &quot;cases&quot;, related to the earthquake&#x27;s impact, with the intent of generating assistance for victims. Due to its popularity, Televisa eventually expanded the topics of the stories the series depicted beyond those related to the earthquake. The series was produced and hosted by Mexican actress and politician Silvia Pinal.

In its first few seasons, the show presented generally lighthearted themes, such as love stories and lost loves; during the 1980s, topics such as domestic violence had still not been acknowledged by Mexican society. In 1996, themes became darker in tone, including cases of rape, incest, child abuse, prostitution, LGBT discrimination and domestic violence. The show became a stage for social reform in Mexico. With these changes, the show was usually first in line to discuss topics that were often kept out of the public eye.

Although &quot;Mujer, Casos de la Vida Real&quot; underwent several metamorphoses in the 2000s, and a spin-off show developed, the show stopped producing episodes in 2007, and in 2009 Pinal confirmed its cancellation.

==History==
&quot;Mujer, Casos de la Vida Real&quot; was initially developed as a response to the Mexican earthquake of 1985, with its aim being to prompt assistance for victims of the earthquake by circulating &quot;real-life cases&quot; of its impact. The show received an outpouring of support from Mexican viewers, causing Televisa, the network that produced the show, to expand its scope beyond earthquake-related stories.

The original format of the show usually consisted of two cases per episode, though some one-hour special cases were presented from time to time. It was hosted by actress and politician Silvia Pinal, who at the beginning of each episode would introduce the case the audience was about to view. Afterward, she would return with comments regarding the moral of the story, as well as present her own personal view on what should be done to prevent such events from happening, or, in some cases, what should be done to allow them to happen. In other programs, a guest expert offered advice or interpretation.

By the mid-1990s, the show aired on Saturday nights on Canal de las Estrellas. In 2001, a weekday afternoon version was started, originally keeping the same style of cases as the Saturday version.

The weekday format changed in May 2006 to a mini-series format. Instead of individual cases, various situations were presented in a continuous mini-series that ran throughout the weekdays (MondayFriday) for one hour each day. This new format brought an end to the usually gritty and, at times, racy material and instead made way for more representation of the love stories and lost loves that characterized the show in its infancy (This was also partially due to being aired in a more family-oriented timeslot).

Reaction to this new format was mixed. Some fans argued that it was not possible to understand the cases without watching every single episode, a problem for many viewers. Other fans argued that the mini-series format allowed for a more accurate representation of cases as opposed to the bare minimum used by the thirty-minute individual cases.

===&quot;Casos de la Vida Real: Edición Especial&quot;===
In the last half of the 1990s and until 2003, Televisa also offered another separate program, a spin-off of the &quot;Mujer, Casos de la Vida Real&quot; franchise. This spin-off, entitled &quot;Casos de la Vida Real: Edición Especial&quot; (&quot;Special Edition&quot;), offered once-a-month cases which were said to have been more urgent to the production, although not much difference was seen between the &quot;special edition&quot; branch and the original program by the public itself. This special editions presented cases in the same format as the original program, but utilized a different opening and contained more graphic and explicit material than the original. It was also televised later in the evening. Mexican audiences saw the special edition once a month and American audiences saw the special edition at 9pm on Friday evenings until 2007.

===Cancellation, airing in the United States, and preservation status===
The show stopped airing on its traditional Saturday night slot in late 2006, the weekday miniseries version continued until November 2007, when it was replaced by two new serials: &quot;Central de Abasto&quot; (later cancelled) and &quot;La rosa de Guadalupe&quot; (still airing).

A 2007 Televisa press release state that &quot;Mujer, Casos de la Vida Real&quot; would return on Saturday evenings starting in January 2008. At first, it was believed that the show was to be canceled, but Pinal denied this. Since that return did not occur, in March 2009, Pinal confirmed that the program had indeed been canceled and would not be returning to the airwaves. Reruns of the program continued to air on Univisión in the United States. In early 2010, however, the program was suddenly pulled from the air on Univisión as well but the show started airing on TeleFutura since July 2012 . During 2010–2011, reruns from episodes produced between 1998 and 2007, from both the weekday and Saturday versions, aired on weekday afternoons on Gala TV, where it returned in 2017.

In the United States, the show currently airs on Spanish language network UniMás, three episodes air every weekday morning (15 per week), it also airs on Galavision.

Few episodes of &quot;Mujer, casos de la vida real&quot; have been released on VHS or DVD. Having developed somewhat of a cult following due to its graphic material and handling of taboo subjects, a handful of people have taken up the task of recording and uploading recent reruns of the show to YouTube. However, while very early episodes are available (with the oldest preserved being &quot;El examen&quot;, aired in 1986 and starring Lucerito), most episodes uploaded are from the weekday version of the series aired between 2001 and 2006, as it is the version syndicated by Televisa to other networks. As a result, virtually all episodes from 1986 to the late 1990s are deemed lost.

==Similar programs==
Based on the success of &quot;Mujer, casos de la vida real&quot; evident with its 22-year run, Televisa&#x27;s main competitor, Azteca, created a similar program entitled &quot;Lo que callamos las mujeres&quot; (translated: &quot;What We Women Stifle&quot;). The material was slightly more professional than the low-budget settings offered by &quot;Mujer&quot;, and &quot;Callamos&quot; episodes revolved more around an actual plot rather than simply the case itself. That show started airing in 2000.
