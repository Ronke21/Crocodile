<text>Stockholm Palace, or the Royal Palace, ( or ) is the official residence and major royal palace of the Swedish monarch (King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia use Drottningholm Palace as their usual residence). Stockholm Palace is in Stadsholmen, in Gamla stan in the capital, Stockholm. It neighbours the Riksdag building. The offices of the King, the other members of the Swedish royal family, and the Royal Court of Sweden are here. The palace is used for representative purposes by the King whilst performing his duties as the head of state.

This royal residence has been in the same location by Norrström in the northern part of Gamla stan in Stockholm since the middle of the 13th century when Tre Kronor Castle was built. In modern times the name relates to the building called &quot;Kungliga Slottet&quot;. The palace was designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and erected on the same place as the medieval Tre Kronor Castle which was destroyed in a fire on 7 May 1697. Due to the costly Great Northern War which started in 1700, construction of the palace was halted in 1709, and not recommenced until 1727—six years after the end of the war. When Tessin the Younger died in 1728, the palace was completed by Carl Hårleman who also designed a large part of its Rococo interior. The palace was not ready to use until 1754, when King Adolf Frederick and Queen Louisa Ulrika moved in, but some interior work proceeded until the 1770s. No major conversions have been done in the palace since its completion, only some adjustments, new interiors, modernization and redecorating for different regents and their families, coloration of the façades and addition of the palace museums. The palace is surrounded by the Lejonbacken and the Norrbro to the north, the &quot;Logården&quot; (known as the Shot Yard in English) and Skeppsbron in the east, the Slottsbacken and the Storkyrkan in the south, and the outer courtyard and Högvaktsterrassen in the northwest.

 the interior of the palace consists of 1,430 rooms of which 660 have windows. The palace contains apartments for the Royal families, representation and festivities such as the State Apartments, the Guest Apartments and the Bernadotte Apartments. More features are the Hall of State, the Royal Chapel, the Treasury with the Regalia of Sweden, Livrustkammaren and the Tre Kronor Museum in the remaining cellar vaults from the former castle. The National Library of Sweden was housed in the northeast wing, the &quot;Biblioteksflygeln&quot; (the Library Wing), until 1878. it houses the Bernadotte Library. The Slottsarkivet is housed in the Chancery Wing. In the palace are the offices of the Royal Court of Sweden, a place of work for approximately 200 employees. The Royal Guards have guarded the palace and the royal family since 1523. A comprehensive renovation of the façade began in 2011, to repair weather damaged parts made from sandstone. The repairs are estimated to cost approximately 500 million crowns (about US$77 million) over a period of 22 years.

The Royal Palace is owned by the Swedish State through the National Property Board of Sweden which is responsible for running and maintaining the palace, while the &quot;Ståthållarämbetet&quot; (the Office of the Governor of the Royal Palaces) manages the royal right of disposition of the palace. The palace belongs to the Crown palaces in Sweden which are at the disposition of the King and the Royal court of Sweden.

== History ==

The first building on this site was a fortress with a core tower built in the 13th century by Birger Jarl to defend Lake Mälaren. The fortress grew to a castle, eventually named Tre Kronor for the core tower&#x27;s spire top decorated with three crowns.

=== Early suggestions ===

At the beginning of the 17th century, King Gustavus Adolphus made plans for a new royal palace. The plans came to naught, but in 1651, his daughter Queen Christina appointed Jean de la Vallée to architect for the royal castles, and among his commissions was to make suggestions for how to improve and update the Tre Kronor Castle. Contemporaneous copperplates from 1654 shows de la Vallée&#x27;s idea of a more visible castle on a raised plateau with a connecting bridge over the Norrström. Queen Christina remodelled and embellished the existing castle extensively, but no new castle was built during her reign.

From 1650 to 1660, Jean de la Vallée made suggestions for large conversions of the castle, but it was not until 1661, when Nicodemus Tessin became City Architect and Architect for the Royal castles, that more substantial plans for a new castle were made. In 1661, he presented the first draft for a conversion of the northern row which his son, Nicodemus Tessin , would later rework and realise in 1692 to 1696.

A map of the Stadsholmen from the 1650s, illustrates de la Vallées suggestion for the conversion of the old castle. The project also brought about an adjustment of the Slottsbacken, making it partially enclosed by buildings. Of interest are Tessin &#x27;s additions in pencil on that map, probably made at the end of the 17th century. There is an early sketch for the northern façade&#x27;s west wing and the two curved wings enclosing the outer courtyard (both executed). Tessin also made plans for the city area west of the palace with large stairs in false perspective where the Axel Oxenstierna palace, among other buildings, are and joining the Västerlånggatan in addition to a wide street to the present Mynttorget, straight though the city block with the present Brantingtorget (not executed). He had envisioned a line of sight from the center of the palace, westwards to the Riddarholmen.

=== The northern row 1692–1696 ===
The northern row of the present palace was built in 1692, in just five months as a part of the old Tre Kronor castle. The new row had the same austere Baroque style that still remain, contrasting with the rest of the Renaissance castle.

At an early stage of the conversion in the 1690s, a number of elderly Swedish artists such as David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl and Johan Sylvius, were still alive and they contributed with artistic work to the completion of the northern row, in particular to the Royal Chapel. Ehrenstrahl made the large religious paintings and Sylvius painted the plafond.

A model for the austere Roman baroque style, including a relatively strict regularity and symmetry, was the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, where the architect in charge of the conversion, Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, went to study buildings in 1688.

The walls surrounding the storages, stables and workshops of the Tre Kronor castle are now behind the Lejonbacken and in the basement of the northern row. Thus, Lejonbacken conceals the old windowless wall behind it. Older walls can also be found higher up in large parts of the northern row&#x27;s façade walls. The walls from the former northeast and northwest square corner-towers for example, are thicker in this part of the palace&#x27;s ground floor, since Tessin re-used the remaining walls and incorporated them in the new palace. About half of the old walls were used in that manner, since the ever frugal Charles XI had only reluctantly agreed to the conversion which started in 1690. Thrift and recycling were guiding principles at the building of the northern row. Hence, the construction proceeded rather quickly and after five months the new row was topped out and roofed. The new walls became higher than the old ones, except for the towers which were completely enclosed in the new walls. The Charles XI&#x27;s Gallery is one more feature remaining since before the fire, all according to Tessin&#x27;s plan.

A new Royal Chapel in the northern row was inaugurated at Christmas in 1696, and a new Hall of State was also planned there. The chapel was to replace the old castle chapel that had been erected by John III in the same location by the old storages and stables at the Tre Kronor castle.

Building the new chapel with the same proportions as the old one and making it fit within the walls of the old chapel, with a retained high ceiling inside the walls of the former northeast tower (now the northeast corner of the palace), proved difficult for Tessin if he was to be able to adhere to the austere Baroque style where all the windows ought to be the same size, and placed in precise rows despite what rooms were behind them. To achieve this, Tessin added a mezzanine floor with smaller square windows just above the lower row of windows. These smaller windows now encircle the whole building, a remnant of the first castle chapel. After the fire, when Tessin could make more substantial alterations, the Royal Chapel and the Hall of State were placed in the southern row instead, and the furniture and inventories, such as benches, household silver and decorations are to some extent preserved in the present-day Royal Chapel.

According to a plan from before the fire, the palace was to be in a square shape without any wings in austere Roman Baroque style, essentially with the rest of the rows looking like the northern row. This suggestion is not preserved, historian Boo von Malmborg suggests that this was probably because Tessin did not dare to present his comprehensive plans to the economical Charles XI.

The new building is depicted in five engravings in the Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna printed in 1695 to 1702: picture No. I.19 the new northern façade of the castle including the Lejonbacken and the square courtyard, picture No. I.20 the new chapel&#x27;s interior, picture No. I.21 the chapel&#x27;s exterior, picture No. I.27 view of the Hedvig Eleonora Church and picture No. I.32 view from the Kungsträdgården. Lejonbacken, which was to lead up to the north gate from the east as well as from the west, was never completed before the fire and is only mentioned in the drawings.

=== The palace fire in 1697 ===

On 7 May 1697, a great castle fire occurred, prompting the building of the present Stockholm Palace. The fire ruined most of the earlier fortress, the Tre Kronor Castle, except for the sturdy, recently constructed walls of the northern row, most of which are still standing. Unlike the rest of the castle, the walls of the northern row could be repaired.

=== The first phase of building the new palace 1697–1709 ===

After the fire, the Regency Council of King Charles XII under the direction of the Queen dowager Hedvig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp at the Karlberg Palace that a new castle should be built on the walls of the burnt castle. Nicodemus Tessin the Younger was the architect appointed to draw and build the new Stockholm Palace. At the same time that Tessin&#x27;s plans were approved, he was appointed head of the construction of the palace as part of his new position: &quot;Överintendent över de Kungliga Slotten&quot; (Superintendent of the Royal Castles), a kind of castle architect. Göran Josuæ Törnquist (later ennobled Adelcrantz) became the Assisting intendent and his deputy, an important position at the construction site, and Hans Conradt Buchegger became general contractor for the palace construction. In 1697, Abraham Winantz Svanssköld, Tessin&#x27;s half-brother, was appointed deputy castle and court architect. Together with Tessin he was active at the palace construction, and they were helped by several German journeymen. Important sculptors and craftsmen during the first years of the construction were, among others, René Chauveau, Bernard Foucquet and his son Jacques Foucquet.

Tessin presented the first finished plans for the new palace within the year of the fire. First, the remnants of the old castle were razed, practically everything was demolished save for parts of the northern row with its strict Baroque, that were still standing. The demolishing was performed by approximately 300 men from mid-May 1697 to mid-spring in 1700, when the remains of the old keep Tre Kronor were re-used as filling for the Lejonbacken. Consequently, most of the material for the new palace was new.

When Tessin got the commission to design the new palace, he abandoned parts of his earlier plan about building a square palace and added the lower wings flanking the palace in the east and west.

This was made to give the palace a more monumental look and this could be executed since there was now more open land in which to expand the palace such as the western area where King Gustav I&#x27;s moat and cannon mounds had previously been.
The southwest wing had to be made shorter since the Storkyrkan was in the way. This asymmetry, created by the different lengths of the wings, was compensated by adding the two detached, semicircular wings for the Royal guards and the Commanders, west of the main building. These wings encircle the courtyard. Tessin&#x27;s plans and commissions to artists still characterizes the façades, walls and stone pilasters as well as walls, floors, pillars and pilasters inside the palace, such as in the Hall of State, the Royal Chapel and the stairwells.

The building of the palace went on with great intensity during the reign of Charles XII, but the costly campaigns during the Great Northern War were impedimental. Charles XII lost at the Battle of Poltava in 1709, and that year the building of the palace came to a complete halt. At that time, the courtyard had been leveled and the courtyard walls were erected to the height of one floor in the south and east part and half a floor in the west part. The palace remained in that semi-finished state until 1727, when the Riksdag granted funds to continue the work. This was one year before Tessin died.

Some embellishments in Tessin&#x27;s plans were never made. For example, he wanted to place an equestrian statue of King Charles XI in the inner courtyard in the French fashion at that time, but King Charles XII disliked that and rejected the idea since it would &quot;totally obscure the beautiful prospect&quot;. Neither did Tessin&#x27;s suggestion to embellish the roof balustrade with sculptures. Tessin&#x27;s vision for this can be seen on an illustration of the palace made by Jean Eric Rehn about 1770.

==== The French artists&#x27; colony ====
The largest group of artists came from France. Between the years 1693 and 1699, sixteen French masons, painters and foundrymen arrived at Stockholm. At Tessin&#x27;s initiative, the craftsmen had received an invitation through the Swedish diplomatic envoy in Paris, Daniel Cronström, to come and work for the Swedish king. They were offered yearly wages and accommodations. The sculptor René Chauveau started out with a salary of 1,000 riksdaler (approximately equal to US$49,550 in 2014) per year; he was among the highest paid in the group. Some artists had brought their families with them and they formed a French artists&#x27; colony. The family members often participated in the construction work. The whole group is referred to as &quot;de fransöske hantwerkarne&quot; (the French craftsmen). Most of them had received their education at the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture in Paris and had worked at King Louis XIV&#x27;s large palace construction at Versailles. Most of the craftsmen were Catholic, and they lived and worked in a very tight-knit community close to the French embassy in Stockholm. They could practice their Catholic faith within the colony, but this was strictly forbidden in the rest of Sweden at that time. When to building of the palace came to a halt in 1709, the colony was dissolved. Some craftsmen, such as René Chauveau and his family, returned to France, but most of them remained in Sweden until they died during the first part of the 18th century.

=== Tessin&#x27;s plan for the palace surroundings ===
Alterations of the land-use plan for the area surrounding the Stockholm Palace had been proposed during the beginning of the 1700s, by the superintendent Nicodemus Tessin . Tessin&#x27;s plans for the city was finished in 1713, and in those the area surrounding the palace were given a new shape. A new Norrbro with rows of sculptures, a great royal cathedral and new Riddarholm Church resembling the St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome. Facing the Stockholms ström in an extension of the Kungsträdgården, Tessin envisioned a long &quot;victory hall&quot; with arcades and columns in a doric order, featuring two corner towers and exhibition halls with headroom. There would be displayed cannons taken as booty, flags and other trophies of war. At the Helgeandsholmen he planned a horse racing stadium for equestrian games and other forms of entertainments, a bear-garden was also to be built. The ideas were not approved by King Charles XII who wanted the Helgeandsholmen for himself.

Ramps were to be built on the Slottsbacken leading up to a narrowing area in front of the Storkyrkan, which was to be redressed in a new baroque façade. The Stortorget was also to be rebuilt and a new city hall and stock exchange was planned. Tessin was convinced that his plans would one day be realized, but building the new palace kept him fully occupied and demanded great financial resources. The time of the Swedish Empire was coming to an end and all the great plans remained unfulfilled.

=== The second phase of building the new palace 1727–1771 ===


Nicodemus Tessin died in 1728, before the palace was finished. The responsibility for the construction was taken over by Carl Hårleman, even though Tessin&#x27;s position as superintendent was formally passed on to his son Carl Gustaf Tessin.

Hårleman formed large parts of the palace&#x27;s interior in a newer style, more to the taste of that time, the Rococo. At Hårleman&#x27;s initiative, the color of the façade was changed from the earlier brick red to light yellow (see Coloration below). When the building was reassumed in 1727, there was anew a need for qualified workers. The second group of French artists and craftsmen arrived in Stockholm in the summer of 1732, as a result of Hårleman&#x27;s negotiations in Paris the previous winter. The group consisted of six persons: two Masters, Antoine Bellette and Michel Le Lievre and four journeymen. Other noted sculptors and craftsmen during the second phase of the construction were Charles Guillaume Cousin, Jacques-Philippe Bouchardon, Pierre Hubert L&#x27;Archevêque, Johan Tobias Sergel and Adrien Masreliez. Giovanni Battista Tiepolo turned down Tessin&#x27;s offer of a commission.

Carl Hårleman died in 1753, and his work was continued by Carl Johan Cronstedt and Carl Gustaf Tessin who finished the palace together. Some parts of the palace where the royal family would live, the northern row and what is presently the State Apartments, were also completed that year. The Stockholm Palace was ready to be used in 1754. The royal family who had lived in the Wrangel Palace on Riddarholmen since the fire in the old castle, moved to their new residence on the First Advent that same year. Instead of living in the State Apartment, the royal family choose to stay in the part now known as the Bernadotte Apartments. The work on the interior continued even after the royal family had settled in. Priority was given to the interior rather than the completion of the Slottsbacken and Lejonbacken.

Lejonbacken and the Chancery Wing were finished by architect Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, who also was put in charge for the work on the interior after Hårleman&#x27;s death. 1771 is considered the year when the palace was officially declared finished. The wall of the eastern quay was completed that year, but during a number of years many of the statues and sculptures in the façade&#x27;s niches were still lacking, such as the eight statues on the southern façade depicting noted Swedish men and the &quot;Enleveringsgruppen&quot; (the Abduction group) on the same façade.

=== Development after the 1770s ===
After the completion of the new palace, no major conversions has been made to the complex save for a number of adaptions, new interiors, modernizations and redecorations for different regents and their families. Museums have also been added to the palace.

Artists like Jean Eric Rehn and Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander were important to the palace&#x27;s grand interior during the end of the 18th and 19th century, when pilasters, columns, wall decorations, etc. were added. Among those sculptors, painters and craftsmen who also contributed during the later renovations were Louis Masreliez (interior work in Classicism and Neoclassicism), Jean Baptiste Masreliez (interior work), Axel Magnus Fahlcrantz (the Logården Wall and the wrought iron fence at Logården), Johan Niclas Byström (sculptures), Sven Scholander (restorations), Johan Axel Wetterlund (façade sculptures of noted men and four allegorical groups on the Logården Wall), Julius Kronberg (ceiling paintings) and Kaspar Schröder (façade sculptures; lion masks at the courtyard façade).

A larger change in the façade was made during the reign of King Charles XIV John resulting in Hårleman&#x27;s light yellow façade coloring being painted over and at the beginning of the 20th century during the reign of King Oscar II when a decision to go back to Tessin&#x27;s original brick red color was made. it is the color of the façade. (see Coloration below)

During the reign of King Oscar I, there was a renewed interest for older styles and when the &quot;Vita Havet&quot; (the White Sea Ballroom) was created from the designs of Per Axel Nyström in 1844–1850, a compromise between old and new was made. Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander was the royal curator of King Charles XV and shared his taste in interior design, this resulted in rooms like the &quot;Victoriasalongen&quot; (the Victoria Drawing room) in a lush, revived Rococo style.

King Oscar II performed a number of additions, improvements and modernizations to the palace. Most of the empty façade niches were filled with sculptures during his reign. He had the palace&#x27;s technical installations updated, such as installing a water pipe system in 1873, installing electricity in 1883, telephone in 1884 and waterborne central heating around 1900. the property is connected to long-distance heating. The king&#x27;s interest also extended to the decoration of the stairwells, and he commissioned Julius Kronberg to paint plafonds in the ceiling of the West Stairwell. Author Georg Svensson, wrote about King Oscar II that &quot;his goal was to complete the construction of the palace as intended in Tessin&#x27;s plans in a manner worthy of this monument&quot;.

During 1922 to 1930, the Logården was rebuilt from the former English park to a more open area with pools of water on either side of the walkway leading from the East Arch to the Skeppsbron.

In 1956 to 1958, Gustav III&#x27;s Museum of Antiquities was restored. Architect and Chief Intendant Ivar Tengbom was appointed for the work. The Treasury was opened in 1970 and the Tre Kronor Museum in 1999. In 2018 600 solar panels were installed on the roof of the palace and are expected to generate an annual output of 170 MWh or at least twelve percent of the palace&#x27;s annual electricity consumption.

In 1998 the Carl XVI Gustaf Jubilee Room was inaugurated to celebrate the silver jubilee of Carl XVI Gustaf. The room is located on the Bernadotte Floor and was designed to be a modern inclusion to the old palace. Today the room is used as a representative room for the king and queen. When Carl XVI Gustaf later in 2023 celebrated his golden jubilee two new golden cyphers were gifted to the king by the Royal Court to be placed at the gate to Logården (the palace gardens).

== Exterior ==

=== Overview ===

The palace is made of brick and sandstone. The roofs are covered with copper and are slanting inward towards the inner courtyard. On the main building they are encircled by a balustrade made of stone. The building consists of four rows, commonly named after the four cardinal directions.

The façades of the palace were each given their own design and not the same as the original northern row. A triumphal arch in splendid Baroque style framed the entrance and the stairwell in the middle of the southern façade, and niches for statues were placed at every second window ledge. The middle parts of the east and west façades were adorned with Baroque pilasters, herms and statues. The palace has a total of 28 statues, 717 balusters, 242 volutes, 972 windows, 31,600 window panes and approximately 7,500 windows, doors and gates. The façade is covered with circa of dimension stone and of plaster. The main building, without the wings, is and encloses the &quot;Inre borggården&quot; (the Inner Courtyard).

Projecting from the corners of the main building are four wings facing the east and the west. Between the two eastern wings is the Logården, and between the two western wings is the Outer Courtyard. All the wings are wide and long except for the southwest wing which is long because of the position of the Storkyrkan. The asymmetry is concealed by the two detached, semicircular wings the &quot;Högvaktsflygeln&quot; (The Royal Guards Wing) and the &quot;Kommendantsflygeln&quot; (the Commander&#x27;s Wing).

Approximately 800,000 people visit the palace each year.


=== The courtyards ===
The palace has two courtyards. Outside the western row is the Outer Courtyard which is the main area for the changing of the guards. A statue of Christina Gyllenstierna stands in the Outer Courtyard, erected at an initiative from the &quot;Föreningen för Stockholms fasta försvar&quot; (the Society for the Permanent Defence of Stockholm) in 1912. The Outer Courtyard is enclosed by two curved wings. The northern is used by the Royal Guards and the southern mainly by the Royal Gift Shop.

The Inner Courtyard is surrounded by the four rows of the palace and is accessed by portals in the middle of the four rows: the south, west, north, and east portals (or arches). The Inner Courtyard is long in the east–west direction and wide in the north–south direction. Tessin had planned to put an equestrian statue depicting Charles XI in the middle of the courtyard, but this plan was never realized.

The design of the large Inner Courtyard with its access to the Logården and the Norrbro is inspired by the courtyard at the Louvre according to the general ideas of the Baroque.

=== The western row ===
The western row, or the western façade, represents &quot;The Male Qualities&quot; and the King. From the western row projects the Chancery Wing towards northwest. The row also abuts the Outer Courtyard and the two curved wings, &quot;Högvaktsflygeln&quot; in the north and the &quot;Kommendantsflygeln&quot; in the south. On the façade are nine medallions depicting nine Swedish regents and ten caryatids. The balcony above the courtyard, completed in 2023 using Tessins original plans, is usually where the Royal Family appears for the Kings Birthday 

==== Sculptures ====
In the frontispiece of the western façade between the windows there are ten female characters called caryatids. The caryatids of the palace are Rococo inspired pilasters in the shape of women, made by the French artist Charles Guillaume Cousin of Gotlandic sandstone in 1744. Each figure is approx. high. Some of them have weathering damages and since there is a risk of small pieces falling from them, a net has been placed over the figures.

&quot;Kungamedaljongerna&quot; (the Royal Medallions) above the windows were made by Cousin. The medallions depict Gustav I, Eric XIV, John III, Sigismund III, Charles IX, Gustavus Adolphus, Queen Christina, Charles X Gustav, Charles XI. The medallions are approximately in diameter and were made of lead in 1745.

=== The northern row ===
The northern row, or the north façade, represents &quot;Power&quot;. This façade is austere and its location and the perspective that it faces north, is meant to mirror and radiate the royal power.

==== Sculptures ====
The artistic adornment on the northern row is very sparse and consists only of a group of figures above the balcony of the Bernadotte Gallery. The group depicts the Swedish coat of arms the &quot;Tre Kronor&quot; (the Three Crowns) which is supported by two goddesses of rumor. The coat of arms itself and the wings of the goddesses are made by Claude Henrion while the rest of the group is made by Bernard Foucquet . It was cast in bronze and was not added to the façade until 1814.

Outside the northern façade is the Lejonbacken with the two Castle Lions, &quot;Slottslejonen&quot;. The models for the lions, inspired by the Medici lions in Villa Medici in Rome, were approved by King Charles XII in 1700, after which the lions were cast in bronze at the Casting House in Normalm in 1702 and 1704. They were then placed at the Lejonbacken as a royal power symbol. The bronze for the lions was from a well, taken as booty from the Kronborg Castle in Helsingør, during King Charles X Gustav&#x27;s campaign in Denmark. The plinths are made from granite and are .

=== The southern row ===

The southern row, or the southern façade, represents &quot;The Nation&quot;. The center of the façade is made in the shape of a triumphal arch with a portal (also known as the South Arch) flanked by three columns made in corinthian order on each side.

Along the façade there are a number of niches with sculptures depicting noted Swedish men. The whole façade is supposed to reflect the grandeur of Sweden, its society and prominent persons in the country. Inside the portal is the South Arch with stairs leading to the Royal Chapel in the east, and the Hall of State in the west. This symbolizes the gathering of both the worldly and the divine power in one place.

At the triumphal arch there is a stone plaque with writing in Latin. The plaque is flanked by two sculptures depicting war trophies. They were created in 1735, by Antoine Bellette and cast by Gerhard Meyer . The inscription on the plaque honoring King Charles XII says:


==== Sculptures ====
The southern façade is the most ornate, with statues, sculptures, and reliefs. In eight, initially empty, niches are statues of notable Swedish men. These were added in the 1890s through the initiative of King Oscar II. The statues are approximately tall, made of zinc by Johan Axel Wetterlund. The statues are depicting Erik Dahlbergh, Carl Linnaeus, Nicodemus Tessin and Georg Stiernhielm to the left of the South Arch, and Haquin Spegel, Olof von Dalin, Rutger von Ascheberg and Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz to the right of the South Arch.
&quot;Enleveringsgruppen&quot; (The Abduction Group), consisting of four sculptures (two to the right and two to the left side of the South Arch), illustrates the abductions of women and are made by Bernard Foucquet at the beginning of the 18th century, but the sculptures were not installed until 1897. From west to the east the sculptures depict: Paris and Helen, Boreas and Orithyia, Pluto and Proserpina, Romulus and Hersilia. They are made of bronze and are approx. high. The group were made at the initiative of King Oscar II to fill the previously empty niches in the triumphal arch. The originals have been restored by Sven Scholander and were cast by Otto Meyer. Bernard Foucquet also made the lions at the Lejonbacken.

==== Reliefs ====

Over the windows of the ground floor are 16 reliefs made in 1699 to 1700, by the French artist René Chauveau. They are made of bronze, and were originally to be placed in the palace&#x27;s stairwells. In the 1890s, the reliefs were mounted on the southern façade, where they replaced a row of windows of the same size. The corresponding windows still exist on the northern façade.
The reliefs depict motifs from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Among the motifs are: the &quot;Flood myth with Deucalion&quot;, the &quot;Pyrrha and Hellen&quot;, the &quot;Perseus and Medusa&quot; and the &quot;Apollo slaying the dragon Python&quot;.

=== The eastern row ===

The eastern row, or the eastern façade, represents &quot;The Female Qualities&quot; and the Queen. Below this façade is the palace park, the Logården. On a balustrade closing of the Logården from the Skeppsbron are four sculptures representing music, religion, poetry, and mercy. These can be seen as old perceptions of female values and interests.

When designing the eastern façade facing the Logården, Tessin is believed to have thought of a Roman country villa, with stairs from the palace garden up to the palace gate. The model for the central part, with colossal pilasters between the windows of the two top floor and the rustic ground floor, are presumed to be Gian Lorenzo Bernini&#x27;s &quot;Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi&quot; in Rome.

==== Sculptures ====
Antoine Bellette made the dragons in the eastern façade, the winged lions on the Logården façade with windows, the shells on the middle floor and the roses under the roof.

On the balustrade between the Logården and the Logårdstrappan, are four allegorical sculptures representing &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Religion&quot;, &quot;Poetry&quot; and &quot;Mercy&quot;. They were made in 1903 by Johan Axel Wetterlund and cast by Otto Meyer and are approx. .

From the eastern façade, two wing projects towards the east. On the short sides of these are two waterfalls and head sculptures of the artists who created the interior of the palace; Pierre Hubert L&#x27;Archevêque and Carl Hårleman on the north side, Carl Gustaf Tessin and Guillaume Thomas Taraval on the south side. These sculptures were made by Johan Axel Wetterlund in 1902, and are made of bronze. Between the sculptures there are two plaques honoring King Oscar II on the south side and Charles XI on the north side.

The coloration of the façade has been altered several times since the completion of the new northern row in 1695. Tessin&#x27;s first coloration was brick-red plaster with white-painted sandstone details. The brick-red color was called (brown-red), and came from brown ochre that was bought for painting the walls of the building. Carl Hårleman took over as the head of the building site when Tessin died in 1728. During the construction, the plaster was left unpainted, while the stone details were painted in white lead.

Before the royal family moved in at the palace in 1754, the whole façade, except for the base which was painted in a yellow ochre color to imitate French sandstone. The yellow tone was the foremost color of the Rococo and the height of fashion at that time. The monochrome yellow color without any contrasting white on the stone details was a way to achieve an architectonical effect with mainly relief.

During the reign of King Charles XIV John in the 1820s, the coloration was changed again, but not fully. The stone details of the northern and eastern rows were painted in a pink color that was not widely appreciated. When the western and southern rows were to be painted, the stone details were done in a grey color which better contrasted to the still yellow plaster. This coloration lasted until the 1890s, when Tessin&#x27;s red color was once again used on the plaster at the initiative of King Oscar II. All paint was removed from the sandstone details and sculptures. , this coloration remains but the red-brown color has become more brown over the years. The removal of the protective paint has contributed to weathering.

=== Lighting ===
The present lighting of the palace&#x27;s façade was inaugurated on 29 March 2006 by King Carl XVI Gustaf. The former lighting was from the 1960s, and its wattage had been reduced over the years, making the palace perceived as progressively darker.

The new lights were approved after long discussions and tests. They deliver almost twice as much luminous flux as the old ones and use half the energy. The lighting was made by a collaboration between the National Property Board of Sweden, the Office of the Governor of the Royal Palaces, The Royal Architect Johan Celsing and the Municipality of Stockholm Traffic Control. The color is described as neutral warm-white.

According to Johan Celsing, the lighting is supposed to enhance the distribution and nuances of the palace and bring out decorative details not previously visible during the evenings. An example of this is the eastern façade where the wings facing the Skeppsbron are now illuminated.

=== Renovations ===
Renovation of the 922 windows in the palace started at the beginning of the 1990s. The age of the windows varies from the mid-18th century to the 1970s. The reason for the renovation was that the windows had not been properly maintained for a number of years. The windows on the south side were the most exposed and the sun had burned the surface causing rot. The renovation of the windows was carried out in collaboration with the National Property Board of Sweden, the Office of the Governor of the Royal Palaces, the Swedish National Heritage Board and the Royal Architect at that time, Ove Hidemark. The work was done in a workshop at the Inner Courtyard and took about ten years. Each window was custom made for the opening where it was originally placed, making the size and shape of each window unique.

, the palace is undergoing a comprehensive renovation. Almost half of the area of the façade is made of sandstone from Gotland, as well as the decorations such as sculptures and ornaments.
In 2008, the National Property Board of Sweden, which is responsible for the maintenance of the palace, found that the sandstone had partially disintegrated and the weathering was only getting worse. Among the incidents was a piece of stone weighing falling from . Most damaged were the sunlit parts, the façades facing south and west. As an interim solution, the Property Board had some parts of the façade covered by a black net to catch any falling rocks.

Ever since the palace was built in the 18th century, the weathering of the sandstone has been a problem and this has accelerated since the oil paint was removed from the stone during the renovation in the 1890s. In the spring of 2008, the Property Board started a comprehensive study on order to make a long-term plan for maintenance of the palace during the next 50 years. The study showed that the Gotlandic sandstone was in worse condition than expected. A number of stones were cracked and loose.

The biggest façade renovation in the history of the palace started in May 2011. Starting with the east wing of the northern row at Strömbron, all the façades will be renovated during the following 22 years, each stage of the work being one year, at a cost of 500 million crowns. To accomplish this, the Swedish National Heritage Board is planning to open up a sandstone quarry on Gotland and start a masonry school.

A couple of times each year a Cabinet Meeting is held with the Swedish government in the Cabinet Meeting Room. The apartment was originally designed as the Royal Couple&#x27;s apartment, but when King Adolf Frederick and Queen Lovisa Ulrika moved into the palace in 1754, they chose to stay in the part now known as the Bernatotte Apartments.

== Palace ghosts ==
There are many tales of ghosts at the palace. One of them is the &quot;Grå Gubben&quot; (the Old Grey Man) who according to tradition lives in the cellar ruins of the old Tre Kronor Castle. He is considered to be a kind of guarding spirit for the palace and he is able to predict the future. According to other legends it is no other than Birger Jarl standing guard. He is supposed to have appeared for Nicodemus Tessin , to tell him that he would not live to see the palace completed.

The most noted of the palace&#x27;s ghosts is the &quot;Vita frun&quot; (the White lady). A White Lady, White woman, Weiße Frau or Dame Blanche is said to exist in many European castles and likewise in Stockholm. According to legend, the White Lady is a messenger of death for someone in the royal family. She showed up when someone was about to die. She is supposedly tall and wears a white silk dress, only the rustle of the silk is heard as she approaches. There are several theories as to who she might be and where she comes from. According to one theory she is the Duchess Agnes of Merán, a German noble lady from the House of Hohenzollern who lived in the 1200s. She was married to Count Otto of Orlamünde until he died in 1293. She murdered both her children by him to be able to marry Albrect, a Count from Nurnberg also known as &quot;The Fair&quot;, but he abandoned her. She died in prison and is since then showing herself as a white lady in the Hohenzollern castles in connection to important family events.

Other sources claim that the White Lady is Perchta von Rosenberg, daughter of Ulrich II von Rosenberg, a German noble woman from the 15th century, who unhappily married against her will to Jan of Liechtenstein. According to tradition she appears in the Český Krumlov Castle in southern Czech Republic. The portrait of her is said to be much like the descriptions of the White Lady at the palace.

Deaths of members of the royal family have occurred in connection to the appearance of the White Lady in the palace. In March 1871, Princess Eugenie saw the ghost and three days later Queen Louise died. The White Lady appeared again in 1907, and shortly after that, King Oscar II died. The last time she was seen was in 1920, when Princess Margaret lay dying. Suddenly the flag at the palace was lowered to half-mast and a guard is said to have seen the White Lady on the roof. Two hours after this the princess died.

<text>The Helodermatidae or beaded lizards are a small family of lizards endemic to North America today, mainly found in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Oaxaca, the central lowlands of Chiapas, on the border of Guatemala, and in the Nentón River Valley, though they were formerly more widespread in the ancient past. Traditionally, the Gila monster and the Mexican beaded lizard were the only species recognized, although the latter has recently been split into several species.

While the fossil record of this family may date back to as far as the Cretaceous with genera such as &quot;Primaderma&quot; and &quot;Paraderma&quot; of North America, the oldest definitive members of the Helodermatidae date to the Early Oligocene, with &quot;Lowesaurus matthewi&quot; from North America (Nebraska) and &quot;Eurheloderma gallicum&quot; from Europe (France).

<text>The Papaloapan River () is one of the main rivers of the Mexican state of Veracruz. Its name comes from the Nahuatl &quot;papaloapan&quot; meaning &quot;river of the butterflies&quot;.

In 1518 Juan de Grijalva&#x27;s expedition spotted the river, naming it Río de Alvarado. The Papaloapan rises in the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca on the border between the states of Veracruz and Oaxaca. It is formed where the Santo Domingo River and the Valle Nacional River join to the southwest of San Juan Bautista Tuxtepec in Oaxaca. The Tonto River is another major tributary.
The Papaloapan meanders for in a northeasterly direction through the coastal plain before draining into Alvarado Lagoon.
The river basin covers , the second largest in Mexico, and contains 244 municipalities with a population of about 3.3 million people.
The cities of San Juan Bautista Tuxtepec and Tlacotalpan (Veracruz) are situated on the banks of the Papaloapan.

In the past the Papaloapan river basin was subject to frequent flooding, with the damage sometimes compounded by cyclones. A particularly severe flood in September 1944 covered , with great loss of life and property. The Miguel Alemán Dam on the Tonto river reduced the problem, but further floods occurred after it had been completed in 1955. A flood in 1958 covered and one in 1969 covered .
Meanwhile, the drainage capacity of the Papaloapan river was being reduced by silt carried by the Santo Domingo river.
Construction of the Cerro de Oro Dam in 1989 on the Santo Domingo river reduced the extent of floods to a manageable level.

The states of Oaxaca and Veracruz are cooperating in developing the river basin. Plans include irrigation to improve agricultural production, promotion of forestry and fish farming and improvements to roads and river navigation. The planned projects will be designed to avoid ecological damage. Environmental damage has been the subject of considerable study.

<doc id="322931" wikidata="Q899124" url="?curid=322931" title="Random coil">
<text>In polymer chemistry, a random coil is a conformation of polymers where the monomer subunits are oriented randomly while still being bonded to adjacent units. It is not one specific shape, but a statistical distribution of shapes for all the chains in a population of macromolecules. The conformation&#x27;s name is derived from the idea that, in the absence of specific, stabilizing interactions, a polymer backbone will &quot;sample&quot; all possible conformations randomly. Many unbranched, linear homopolymers — in solution, or above their melting temperatures — assume (approximate) random coils.

==Random walk model: The Gaussian chain==

There are an enormous number of different ways in which a chain can be curled around in a relatively compact shape, like an unraveling ball of twine with much open space, and comparatively few ways it can be more or less stretched out. So, if each conformation has an equal probability or statistical weight, chains are much more likely to be ball-like than they are to be extended — a purely entropic effect. In an ensemble of chains, most of them will, therefore, be loosely balled up. This is the kind of shape any one of them will have most of the time.

Consider a linear polymer to be a freely-jointed chain with &quot;N&quot; subunits, each of length formula_1, that occupy zero volume, so that no part of the chain excludes another from any location. One can regard the segments of each such chain in an ensemble as performing a random walk (or &quot;random flight&quot;) in three dimensions, limited only by the constraint that each segment must be joined to its neighbors. This is the &quot;ideal chain&quot; mathematical model. It is clear that the maximum, fully extended length &quot;L&quot; of the chain is formula_2. If we assume that each possible chain conformation has an equal statistical weight, it can be shown that the probability &quot;P&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) of a polymer chain in the population to have distance &quot;r&quot; between the ends will obey a characteristic distribution described by the formula

: formula_3

where formula_4 is the mean of formula_5.

The &quot;average&quot; (root mean square) end-to-end distance for the chain, formula_6, turns out to be formula_1 times the square root of &quot;N&quot; — in other words, the average distance scales with &quot;N&quot; 0.5.

==Real polymers==

A real polymer is not freely-jointed. A -C-C- single bond has a fixed tetrahedral angle of 109.5 degrees. The value of &quot;L&quot; is well-defined for, say, a fully extended polyethylene or nylon, but it is less than &quot;N&quot; x &quot;l&quot; because of the zig-zag backbone. There is, however, free rotation about many chain bonds. The model above can be enhanced. A longer, &quot;effective&quot; unit length can be defined such that the chain can be regarded as freely-jointed, along with a smaller &quot;N&quot;, such that the constraint &quot;L&quot; = &quot;N&quot; x &quot;l&quot; is still obeyed. It, too, gives a Gaussian distribution. However, specific cases can also be precisely calculated. The average end-to-end distance for &quot;freely-rotating&quot; (not freely-jointed) polymethylene (polyethylene with each -C-C- considered as a subunit) is &quot;l&quot; times the square root of 2&quot;N&quot;, an increase by a factor of about 1.4. Unlike the zero volume assumed in a random walk calculation, all real polymers&#x27; segments occupy space because of the van der Waals radii of their atoms, including bulky substituent groups that interfere with bond rotations. This can also be taken into account in calculations. All such effects increase the mean end-to-end distance.

Because their polymerization is stochastically driven, chain lengths in any real population of synthetic polymers will obey a statistical distribution. In that case, we should take &quot;N&quot; to be an average value. Also, many polymers have random branching.

Even with corrections for local constraints, the random walk model ignores steric interference between chains, and between distal parts of the same chain. A chain often cannot move from a given conformation to a closely related one by a small displacement because one part of it would have to pass through another part, or through a neighbor. We may still hope that the ideal-chain, random-coil model will be at least a qualitative indication of the shapes and dimensions of real polymers in solution, and in the amorphous state, as long as there are only weak physicochemical interactions between the monomers. This model, and the Flory-Huggins Solution Theory, for which Paul Flory received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974, ostensibly apply only to ideal, dilute solutions. But there is reason to believe (e.g., neutron diffraction studies) that excluded volume effects may cancel out, so that, under certain conditions, chain dimensions in amorphous polymers have approximately the ideal, calculated size 
When separate chains interact cooperatively, as in forming crystalline regions in solid thermoplastics, a different mathematical approach must be used.

Stiffer polymers such as helical polypeptides, Kevlar, and double-stranded DNA can be treated by the worm-like chain model.

Even copolymers with monomers of unequal length will distribute in random coils if the subunits lack any specific interactions. The parts of branched polymers may also assume random coils.

Below their melting temperatures, most thermoplastic polymers (polyethylene, nylon, etc.) have amorphous regions in which the chains approximate random coils, alternating with regions that are crystalline. The amorphous regions contribute elasticity and the crystalline regions contribute strength and rigidity.

More complex polymers such as proteins, with various interacting chemical groups attached to their backbones, self-assemble into well-defined structures. But segments of proteins, and polypeptides that lack secondary structure, are often assumed to exhibit a random-coil conformation in which the only fixed relationship is the joining of adjacent amino acid residues by a peptide bond. This is not actually the case, since the ensemble will be energy weighted due to interactions between amino acid side-chains, with lower-energy conformations being present more frequently. In addition, even arbitrary sequences of amino acids tend to exhibit some hydrogen bonding and secondary structure. For this reason, the term &quot;statistical coil&quot; is occasionally preferred. The conformational entropy of the random-coil stabilizes the unfolded protein state and represents main free energy contribution that opposes to protein folding.

== Spectroscopy ==
A random-coil conformation can be detected using spectroscopic techniques. The arrangement of the planar amide bonds results in a distinctive signal in circular dichroism. The chemical shift of amino acids in a random-coil conformation is well known in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Deviations from these signatures often indicates the presence of some secondary structure, rather than complete random coil. Furthermore, there are signals in multidimensional NMR experiments that indicate that stable, non-local amino acid interactions are absent for polypeptides in a random-coil conformation. Likewise, in the images produced by crystallography experiments, segments of random coil result simply in a reduction in &quot;electron density&quot; or contrast. A randomly coiled state for any polypeptide chain can be attained by denaturing the system. However, there is evidence that proteins are never truly random coils, even when denatured (Shortle &amp; Ackerman).

<text>The Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region is the low-lying area surrounding the Pearl River estuary, where the Pearl River flows into the South China Sea. Referred to as the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area in official documents, the region is one of the most densely populated and urbanized regions in the world, and is considered a megacity by numerous scholars. It is currently the wealthiest region in Southern China and one of the wealthiest regions in China along with the Yangtze River Delta in Eastern China and Jingjinji in Northern China. Most of the region is part of the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone, which is a special economic zone of China.

The region is a megalopolis, and is at the southern end of a larger megalopolis running along the southern coast of China, which include metropolises such as Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Macao. The nine largest cities of the PRD had a combined population of 86 million in 2022; the PRD has become the largest urban area in the world in both size and population. The region&#x27;s traditional language is Cantonese; in the late 20th century and the 21st century, due to the high inflow of migrant workers coming from other regions, Mandarin has gradually become a lingua franca.

The west side of this region, along with Chaoshan, was also the source of much Chinese emigration from the 19th to the mid 20th centuries, including to the Western world, where they formed many Chinatowns. Today, much of the Chinese diaspora in the US, Canada, Australia, Latin America, and much of Southeast Asia traces their ancestry to the west side of this region.


== Geology ==
== Geography ==

The river delta, also known as the Golden Delta of Guangdong, is formed by three major rivers, the Xi Jiang (West River), Bei Jiang (North River), and Dong Jiang (East River). The flat lands of the delta are criss-crossed by a network of tributaries and distributaries of the Pearl River. The Pearl River Delta is actually two alluvial deltas, separated by the core branch of the Pearl River. The Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang converge to flow into the South China Sea and Pearl River in the west, while the Dong Jiang only flows into the Pearl River proper in the east.

The Xi Jiang begins exhibiting delta-like characteristics as far west as Zhaoqing, although this city is not usually considered a part of the PRD region. After passing through the Lingyang Gorge and converging with the Bei Jiang, the Xi Jiang opens up and flows as far east as Nansha District and as far west as Xinhui. Major distributaries of the Xi include Donghui Shuidao, Jiya Shuidao, Hutiaomen Shuidao, Yinzhou Hu, and the main branch of the Xi Jiang. Jiangmen and Zhongshan are the major cities found in the western section of the delta.

The Bei Jiang enters the delta plains at Qingyuan but does not begin to split until near Sanshui. From here the two main distributaries are Tanzhou Shuidao and Shunde Shuidao which form multiple mouths along the west side of the Pearl River&#x27;s estuary. Two other distributaries, Lubao Yong and Xinan Yong, split from the Bei further north and converge with the Liuxi He to form the main branch of the Pearl River just north of Guangzhou. The other major city in the north section of the delta is Foshan.

The Dong Jiang flows through Huizhou into the delta. It begins diverging northeast of Dongguan into many distributaries, including the Dongguan Shuidao. Distributuares enter the Pearl River as far north as Luogang and as far south as Hu Men (Tiger Gate).

Saltwater crocodiles were present within the Pearl River estuary during antiquity.

== Location and demographics ==

As well as the delta itself, the term Pearl River Delta refers to the dense network of cities that covers nine prefectures of the province of Guangdong, namely Dongguan, Foshan, Guangzhou, Huizhou, Jiangmen, Shenzhen, Zhaoqing, Zhongshan and Zhuhai and the SARs of Hong Kong and Macau. The 2010/2011 State of the World Cities report, published by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, estimates the population of the delta region at 120 million people; it is rapidly urbanising.

The eastern side of the PRD (Shenzhen, Dongguan), dominated by foreign capital, is the most developed economically. The western areas (Foshan, Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Jiangmen), dominated by local private capital, are open for development. New transport links between Hong Kong, Macau and Zhuhai in the PRD are expected to open up new areas for development, further integrate the cities, and facilitate trade within the region. The Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge, and the proposed Shenzhen–Zhongshan Bridge, currently in the planning phase, will be amongst the longest bridges in the world with a total length of approximately each.
Until 1985, the PRD had been mainly dominated by farms and small rural villages, but after the economy was reformed and opened, a flood of investment turned it into the land&#x27;s economic powerhouse. The PRD&#x27;s startling growth was fueled by foreign investment coming largely from Hong Kong manufacturers that moved their operations into the PRD. In 2003, Hong Kong companies employed 11 million workers in their PRD operations. Lately there have been extreme labour shortages in the region due to runaway economic growth which caused wages to rise by about 20 to 30 percent in the past two years.

== Economy ==
The Pearl River Delta has been one of the most economically dynamic regions of the People&#x27;s Republic of China since the launch of China&#x27;s reform programme in 1979. With annual gross domestic product growth of 13.45 percent over three decades since 1978, it is 3.5 percentage points higher than the national average. Since 1978 almost 30 percent of all foreign investment in China was in the PRD. In 2007 its GDP rose to US$448 billion which makes its economy about the size of Taiwan&#x27;s and by 2019 this figure has increased to US$2.0 trillion or about the same size as Canada. The abundance of employment opportunities created a pool of wealthy, middle-income, professional consumers with an annual per capita income that puts them among China&#x27;s wealthiest. Since the onset of China&#x27;s reform program, the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone has been the fastest growing portion of the fastest growing province in the fastest growing large economy in the world.

The industrial cities in the Pearl River Delta have been called the &quot;Factory of the World&quot; or the &quot;World&#x27;s Factory&quot; due to the presence of industrial parks populated with factories from foreign investments. However, the target market of the delta region&#x27;s exports has become increasingly domestic rather than foreign. Dongguan, Zhongshan, Nanhai, and Shunde are the four cities known as the Four Guangdong Dragons for their high growth rates and rapid development from late the 1980s to the 2000s.

Although the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone encompasses only 0.4 percent of the land area and only 3.2 percent of the 2000 census population of mainland China, it accounted for 8.7 percent of GDP, 35.8 percent of total trade, and 29.2 percent of utilised foreign capital in 2001. By 2016 the Pearl River Delta accounted for 9.1 percent of China&#x27;s GDP. These figures show the remarkable level of economic development to which the Pearl River Delta has been subjected in order to become an &#x27;Economic Zone&#x27;, as well as the international orientation of the region&#x27;s economy. This orientation has attracted numerous investors from all over the world who use the Greater Pearl River Delta region as a platform for serving global and Chinese markets.

As of 2008, the Central Government has introduced new labor laws, environmental and other regulations to reduce pollution, industrial disputes, produce safer working conditions and protect the environment. The costs of producing low margin and commodity goods have increased. This is on top of the rising cost for energy, food, transport and the appreciation of the renminbi against the falling US dollar. Some manufacturers will need to cut costs by moving up the value chain or moving to more undeveloped regions.

=== Significance of PRD===
The Pearl River Delta established itself as the factory location of choice for global companies that were headquartered in Hong Kong in the 1980s. The industrial output of the Pearl River Delta was generated in the main by state-owned enterprises. Meanwhile the industrial output of collective-owned enterprises diminished over time, with private enterprises and joint ventures increasing their share of the Pearl River Delta&#x27;s industrial output to 37.5 percent by the mid-1990s.

Today urban areas with the assistance of the municipal governments in the Pearl River Delta are attempting to rebrand industrial output as originating from &quot;the world&#x27;s tech lab&quot; or &quot;design studio&quot;. The Pearl River Delta has become the world&#x27;s workshop and is a major manufacturing base for products such as electronics, garments and textiles, plastic products, and a range of other goods.

Private-owned enterprises have developed quickly in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone and are playing an increasing role in the region&#x27;s economy, particularly after year 2000 when the development environment for private-owned enterprises has been greatly relaxed.

In 2001 nearly five percent of the world&#x27;s goods were produced in the Greater Pearl River Delta, with a total export value of US$289 billion. Over 70,000 Hong Kong companies had factory plants in the Greater Pearl River Delta.

== Container shipping ==

In the Pearl River Delta an extensive system of container feeder shipping has been established. This system of containerization also serves ports within the same region. The container port of Shenzhen has surpassed Hong Kong as major hub with Guangzhou serving as another significant container shipping hub for the Pearl River Delta.

== Transportation ==

=== Urban rail transport ===
PRD is served by six different metro systems throughout the metropolitan area consisting of Guangzhou Metro, Shenzhen Metro, MTR, FMetro, Macau Light Rail Transit and Dongguan Rail Transit. In addition, the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region intercity railway provides regional transit between cities of the PRD.

== Pearl River mega-city ==

A 2011 article in British newspaper &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported on a &quot;Turn The Pearl River Delta Into One&quot; project. The stated goal was to &quot;mesh the transport, energy, water and telecommunications networks of the nine cities together.&quot;
(Hong Kong and Macau were not included.) However, the Chinese government denied that such a project existed.

== Pollution ==
The Pearl River Delta is notoriously polluted. After thirty years of rapid industrialization, the Pearl River Delta has in parts been famed for pollution. Acid rain, smog, water pollution, and electronic waste contribute to the perceived problems. In travel literature the Pearl River Delta has been titillated as among the most &quot;attractive&quot; &quot;pollution day trips from Hong Kong&quot;.

Treatment facilities for sewage and industrial waste are failing to keep pace with the growth in population and industry in the area. A large portion of the pollution is brought about by factories run by Hong Kong manufacturers in the area. Much of the area is frequently covered with a brown smog. This has a strong effect on the pollution levels in the delta.

On 22 March 2007 the World Bank approved a $96 million loan to the PRC government to reduce water pollution in the Pearl River Delta. On December 23, 2008, it was announced that ¥48.6 billion (about $7.1 billion) will be spent on the river by mid-2010 to clean up the river&#x27;s sewage problems quoted by Zhang Hu, the director of Guangzhou municipal bureau of water affairs. The city will build about 30 water treatment plants, which will treat 2.25 million tonnes of water per day. The program hopes to cut down the amount of sewage in the area by 85%, and was also of fundamental importance for the 2010 Asian Games held in Guangzhou from November 12, 2010, to November 27, 2010.

In October 2009 Greenpeace East Asia released a report, &quot;Poisoning the Pearl River&quot; that detailed the results of a study it conducted in which 25 samples were collected from five manufacturing facilities in the Greater Pearl River Delta. The study concluded that all the facilities sampled were discharging waste-water containing chemicals with proven or suspected hazardous properties including beryllium, copper, manganese, and heavy metals, as well as high levels of organic chemicals. These substances are associated with a long list of health problems such as cancer, endocrine disruption, renal failure and damage to the nervous system as well being known to harm the environment. Three of the five facilities sampled (Qingyuan Top Dragon Co. Ltd, Wing Fung P.C. Board Co. Ltd. and Techwise Qingyuan Circuit Co. Ltd. ) contained concentrations of chemicals which exceeded the limits set by Guangdong provincial effluent standards. These companies were then subjected to a Clean Production Audit according to Article 28 of China&#x27;s Cleaner Production Promotion Law. Guangdong Environmental Protection Bureau took a stance against the companies by blacklisting them.

Pearl River Delta is a strong source of greenhouse gases as well. Although it is hard to estimate overall greenhouse gas emissions from such a large megacity, scientists have shown that Pearl River Delta exhibits one of the strongest anomalies in carbon dioxide concentration around the world. This enhancement is easily discernible from satellite observations.

<text>Helgeandsholmen () is a small island in central Stockholm, Sweden. It is located north of Stadsholmen, and east of Strömsborg, with which, together with Riddarholmen, it forms Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm. Helgeandsholmen contains the Riksdag Building and the Museum of Medieval Stockholm, and is connected to neighbouring islands through three bridges: Riksbron, Stallbron, and Norrbro. Despite the small size, it is very important as it contains the parliament building, where the Prime Minister is.

The terrace in the eastern end, called &quot;Strömparterren&quot; (&quot;The Stream Parterr&quot;), is a public park with a restaurant dating from 1832, while the flight of stairs leading down to the water is from 1807–1810. The quay west of the Riksdag Building once surrounded Sweden&#x27;s central bank Sveriges Riksbank and was thus named &quot;Bankkajen&quot; (&quot;The Bank Quay&quot;), while the streets on southern and northern sides are called &quot;Norra/Södra Helgeandstrappan&quot; (&quot;The Northern/Southern Helgeand Stairs&quot;), all of them named in 1925.

== Origin of the name ==
First mentioned in a letter written in Latin July 28, 1320, the name &#x27;Helgeandsholmen&#x27;, a corruption of &quot;Helige andens holme&quot; (&quot;Islet of the Holy Spirit&quot;), appears as &quot;in insula dicta helghaanzsholm&quot; (&quot;on the island called Helgeandsholm&quot;). At the time, &quot;helgeandshus&quot; (Old Swedish: &quot;hälgha ands hus&quot;. &quot;hälandzhus&quot;, &quot;helghanzhhws&quot;, &quot;hälianshus&quot;) was a name used for charitable institutions spiritual in nature, in Stockholm first mentioned in a testament from April 24, 1301 (&quot;domus sancti spiritus&quot;).

== History ==

=== A set of islets ===

Though one regular shaped island today, Helgeandsholmen was until quite recently a set of islets. Before the start of extensive archaeological excavations in 1978, it was traditionally believed that the present island once encompassed three islets:
* A larger main island to the south, called Helgeandsholmen from the 14th century. The excavations, however, convincingly showed that during the early Middle Ages this island in fact consisted of two smaller islets, of which we know absolutely nothing.
* And, north of this major island, two smaller ones, once the property of the abbey at Klara:
** One called &quot;Barkarholmen&quot; (&quot;Bark Islet&quot;), suggesting there was a tanning business here as bark was an important raw material for tanning. This islet was also known as &quot;Klosterholmen&quot; (&quot;Abbey Islet&quot;).
** And, east of Barkarholmen, a rocky islet called &quot;Lilla Stockholm&quot; (&quot;Little Log Islet&quot;) in the 16th century, renamed &quot;Bryggeriholmen&quot; (&quot;Brewery Islet&quot;) during the 17th century (in reference to a brewery in operation 1641–45), and after that called &quot;Slaktarholmen&quot; (&quot;Butcher&#x27;s Islet&quot;) after a slaughterhouse operating there. Lilla Stockholm disappeared when Norrbro was finally completed in 1806.

=== The Helgeand House ===

As mentioned above, a charitable institution organized by a pious foundation was located on the island, receiving sick people, poor and elderly as well as foreigners, and accepting donations from burghers in city, through which the institution became an important landowner. The original &quot;Helgeandshuset&quot; (&quot;The House of the Holy Spirit&quot;) probably dates back to the 13th century but is not mentioned until 1301. Rebuilt after a fire in 1410, it was moved to Riddarholmen by King Gustav Vasa (1496–1560) in 1531. Though the appearance of Helgeandshuset is not known, it is believed to have resembled similar institutions elsewhere and thus consist of a hospital ward and a church surrounded by other buildings and a graveyard.

=== Norrbro ===

Originally, Norrbro stretched diagonally across Helgeandsholmen from (what is today) Mynttorget to Gustav Adolfs torg. Though not mentioned until 1288, the first bridge is believed to have been built with the foundation of the city in 1252. Like virtually all bridges during the Middle Ages, Norrbro was built in wood, at the time considered appropriate as bridges then easily could be dismantled during sieges.

Drawbridges are mentioned in 1318, and the general urban code from the mid 14th century prescribes six cities around Lake Mälaren – Arboga, Enköping, Sigtuna, Strängnäs, Västerås and Uppsala – to share the costs of maintenance with Stockholm, thus indicating the bridge wasn&#x27;t merely of interest to the city, but a vital part of the regional road system. These neighbouring cities gradually came to question this obligation however, and during the 16th and 17th centuries Stockholm was, bit by bit, to take charge of the bridge alone.

Until the 1640s, the width of the street varied from 10 to 20 ells (5.9–11.9 metres), but as the northern settlements were incorporated with the city in 1635, so was Helgeandsholmen, and the standard street width was regulated. Governor Klas Fleming (1592–1644) had Norrbro straightened out, in line with his own site on the street, and the width set to 24 ells (14.3 metres).

Norrbro was rebuilt as one of the city&#x27;s first stone bridges, the northern section completed in 1797, and the southern in 1806.

=== City gates and fortifications ===
An inner gate, &quot;Norreport&quot;, is mentioned south of Helgeandsholmen in 1409, and an outer gate in the 1460s, but was probably older than that. Both gates were eventually supplied with defensive towers. In the early 15th century, the walls were extended and a western tower added to the fortifications, the entire structure being outdated later that century and finally demolished by 1672.

=== Royal Stables ===
Probably established on the island as early as 1535, Royal Stables were at first accommodated in the former hospital ward, and by 1612 given a for the purpose suitable building. First relocated north of Helgeandsholmen in the 1640s, they were moved back again in 1680 to a building designed by architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder (1615–1684). Destroyed by a fire in 1696, the stables were immediately rebuilt in the design of Nicodemus Tessin the Younger (1654–1728), a structure surviving different alternations until the beginning of the 20th century.

=== Historical canals ===

Over the years, several canals have passed through today&#x27;s Helgeandsholmen, most notably between and south of the two palaces described above. Before post-glacial rebound made the canals unnecessary, spring floods was a serious problem often forcing the reconstruction of bridges and other structures, but by the 17th century the first canal was scrapped, the second when the Parliament Building was built in the early 20th century.

=== 17th-century structures ===

Needing access to a water mill, a royal workshop for the production of gun carriages, &quot;Lådmakaregården&quot; (&quot;The Box Making Court&quot;) was relocated to Barkholmen in the early 17th century, built on poles and reaching around Stockholmen. It was later demolished and replaced by the Gyldenklou House.

Having bought a site north of the Royal Stables in 1637, Klas Fleming had his private palace, &quot;Flemingska huset&quot; (&quot;The Fleming House&quot;), built after his own German-Dutch renaissance design, and, subsequently, the entire neighbourhood adapted to it. In 1696 however, the Crown bought the house to have it demolished for the extension of the stables.

During the 1640s, several people close to the Crown and Royal Court were allotted sites on Helgeandsholmen, and in 1645, Queen Christina donated the site north of The Fleming House to Anders Gyldenklou (–1665 ?), Secretary of the Chancellery, who had two buildings erected there, called &quot;Gyldenklouska huset&quot; (&quot;The Gyldenklou House&quot;), and subsequently sold to Lord High Chancellor (&quot;Riksdrots&quot;) Per Brahe (1602–1680). The palace, a Dutch renaissance structure four storeys tall with a stepped gable and called &quot;Braheska huset&quot; (&quot;The Brahe house&quot;) until its demolition, is often appearing next to the Fleming House in engravings and paintings from the 17th and 18th centuries. It was taken over by the Crown in 1696, and used for the royal administration after the fire at the Royal Palace in 1697. By 1770, the building was handed over to the Royal Stables, who used it for various purposes until its demolition in 1815.

=== Modern history ===

Completed in 1807–10, the semicircular space on Norrbro&#x27;s eastern side was first used as a storage space for fisheries, finally removed on the commands of the king in 1821. Ten years later, a park was established, at the time still with a canal passing through it. Opened to the public in 1832, it became the first municipal park in Stockholm. During the following 100 years, the park was furnished with various pavilions, bookstalls, and stages, and became a popular spot among the city&#x27;s society. By the 1930s however, the park had become abandoned and shabby, and it was therefore redesigned first in 1937-38, and then again following the archaeological operations in the 1970s.
A bazaar called &quot;Norrbro-basaren&quot; built on the western side of Norrbro in 1838–39, remained a vital social and commercial meeting place until its removal in 1903 for the creation of the small park in front of the Riksdag Building.

By the 1870s, the old Riksdag Building on Riddarholmen had become too small and was regarded as not representative enough, a problem also plaguing the Riksbank, then residing at the Järntorget square in Gamla stan. Helgeandsholmen was soon suggested as an appropriate site for both institutions, under the condition that the new structure didn&#x27;t overshadow the Royal Palace. The winning proposal from an architectural competition in the late 1880s was further developed by the architect Helgo Zettervall (1831–1907) assisted by Aron Johansson (1860–1936). The old buildings were demolished in 1893, and both institutions completed during 1897–1906. The Riksbank was moved to Brunkebergstorg in 1976, and the building taken over by the Riksdag.

<text>Joaquín Salvador Lavado Tejón (17 July 193230 September 2020), better known by his pen name Quino (), was an Argentine cartoonist. His comic strip &quot;Mafalda&quot; (which ran from 1964 to 1973) is popular in many parts of the Americas and Europe and has been praised for its use of social satire as a commentary on real-life issues.

==Early life==
Joaquín Salvador Lavado Tejón was born in Mendoza, Argentina, on 17 July 1932 to emigrant Andalusian parents from Fuengirola, Málaga. Following Spanish name tradition, &quot;Lavado&quot; is his first or paternal surname, and &quot;Tejón&quot; his maternal one. Because of his parents&#x27; limited social circle, he spoke with an Andalusian accent until the age of six. He retained an affection for his parents&#x27; Spanish culture and flamenco into his later years. He obtained Spanish citizenship in 1990 and remained a dual citizen of Spain and Argentina.

He was called &quot;Quino&quot; from his childhood on, to distinguish him from his uncle, the illustrator Joaquín, who helped to awaken his vocation of cartooning at an early age. In 1945, after the death of his mother, he enrolled and started his studies at Escuela de Bellas Artes de Mendoza. Shortly after, his father died in 1948 when Quino was 16 years old. A year later he abandoned his studies, with the intent to become a cartoonist. Soon he would sell his first illustration, an advertisement for a fabric store.

His first humor page was published in the weekly magazine, &quot;Esto Es&quot;, which led to the publication of other works in many other magazines: &quot;Leoplán&quot;, &quot;TV Guía&quot;, &quot;Vea y Lea&quot;, &quot;Damas y Damitas&quot;, &quot;Usted&quot;, &quot;Panorama&quot;, &quot;Adán&quot;, &quot;Atlántida&quot;, &quot;Che&quot;, the daily &quot;Democracia&quot;, etc. In 1954, his cartoons became regulars in &quot;Rico Tipo&quot;, &quot;Tía Vicenta&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Merengue&quot;.

==Career==
===Mafalda===
His first compilation book, &quot;Mundo Quino&quot;, was published in 1963. At the same time he was developing pages for an advertising campaign for Mansfield, an electrical household appliance company, for which he created the character of Mafalda, basing her name on the same sounds as in the Mansfield brand name. The advertising campaign never was executed, which led to the publication of Mafalda&#x27;s first story in &quot;Leoplán&quot;. Subsequently, it appeared regularly in the weekly magazine &quot;Primera Plana&quot;, since the director of the magazine was a friend of Quino. Between 1965 and 1967 it was published in the newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot;; soon after the first compilation book was released, it began to be published in Italy, Spain (where, on account of Franco-era censorship, it was tagged as “for adults only”), Portugal, and many other countries. It was also translated to 12 languages.

Mafalda was created as an irreverent and non-conformist six-year-old who hated fascism, militarism and soup, and loved the Beatles. The character attempted to reflect the world of adults as seen through the eyes of a smart child. Her friends reflected different personalities like the insecure but studious Felipe, the gossip-girl Susanita, the sturdy but dim-witted Manolito, the naive Miguelito, the rebel and witty Libertad and Mafalda&#x27;s baby brother Guille. The character and the series has been compared to Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic series.

Quino abandoned the story of Mafalda on 25 June 1973, claiming that he wanted to avoid repeating himself; in later years, however, he said that the changing political landscape in Latin America had also influenced his decision: &quot;If I had continued drawing her, they would have shot me.&quot; Following the 1976 coup d&#x27;état in Argentina, he moved to Milan, Italy, where he continued to create humor pages. Although he never returned to Mafalda and her friends in a comic strip format, he did use the character at certain specific moments: to explain the Organic Law on the Right to Education (LODE) on a commission from the Spanish government in 1986, for a COVID-19 awareness campaign in 2020, and, in 1977, to illustrate the Declaration of the Rights of the Child for UNICEF. Argentine producer Daniel Mallo converted 260 &quot;Mafalda&quot; strips into a TV show in 1965.

In 2008, at the initiative of the &quot;Museo del Dibujo y la Ilustración&quot;, the company Subterráneos de Buenos Aires created a mural of Mafalda in the Perú metro station at the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires. In 2009, Quino participated with an original Mafalda work, created for &quot;El Mundo&quot;, in the &quot;Bicentennial: 200 years of Graphic Humor&quot; that the &quot;Museo del Dibujo y la Ilustración&quot; held at the Eduardo Sívori Museum of Buenos Aires.

===Later works===

While &quot;Mafalda&quot; continued to be used for human rights campaigns in Argentina and abroad, Quino dedicated himself to writing other editorial-style comics. The comics were published in Argentina and abroad. Since 1982, the Argentine newspaper &quot;Clarín&quot; has published his cartoons weekly.

After a visit with Cuban cartoon director Juan Padrón, the two produced a series of cartoons. Between 1986 and 1988, they made six &quot;Quinoscopio&quot; cartoons through the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industrias Cinematográficos, none of which were longer than six minutes. In addition, the pair worked on 104 short Mafalda cartoons in 1994. Quino eventually retired in 2006.
While &quot;Mafalda&quot; concentrated on children and their innocent, realistic view of the world, his later comics featured ordinary people with ordinary feelings. The humor is characteristically cynical, often poking fun at real-life situations, such as marriage, technology, authority, and food. This cynical humor is attributed as one of the reasons for his success throughout Latin America and much of the world outside Latin America. His cartoons of aporteñado Argentine topic of the 1960s and 1970s have been edited and translated into 26 different languages apart from the original Rioplatense Spanish. Collected in numerous volumes by Argentine publisher Ediciones de la Flor, these comics are readily available.

==Personal life==
Quino married Alicia Colombo in 1960. The couple never had children. He and his wife lived in exile in Milan starting in 1976, before returning to Argentina seven years later when the military dictatorship came to an end. He subsequently divided his time between Buenos Aires, Madrid, and Milan. He was an agnostic. In 2017, degenerative glaucoma left him nearly blind.

==Collections==
A portion of Quino&#x27;s work resides at Vanderbilt University&#x27;s Special Collections Library, as part of their .

==Awards and honors==
Quino won many international awards and honors throughout his career. In 1982, Quino was chosen Cartoonist of the Year by fellow cartoonists around the world, he won the Konex Platinum Award for Visual Arts in 1982 and 1992, the Konex Special Mention in 2012 and the Konex of Honour in 2022. In 1988, he was named an Illustrious Citizen of Mendoza. In 1997, he was given U Giancu&#x27;s Prize at the International Cartoonists Exhibition in Rapallo, Italy. In 2000 he received the second Quevedos Ibero-American Prize for Graphic Humor. In March 2014 he was awarded the French Legion of Honour. Additionally, the Colegiales neighbourhood of Buenos Aires named their plaza &quot;Plaza Mafalda&quot;.

In May 2014 Quino was presented with the Senator Domingo Faustino Sarmiento cultural award by the Senate of Argentina.

In 2014, Quino was awarded the Prince of Asturias award in recognition of his work, 50 years after creating the character of Mafalda. He received the prize from King Felipe VI of Spain on 24 October 2014 at a ceremony in Oviedo, Spain.

An asteroid discovered in January 1999 was named 27178 Quino after him.

==Death==
Quino died on 30 September 2020 from a stroke, at the age of 88.

<doc id="322935" wikidata="Q4964977" url="?curid=322935" title="Brian Paddick, Baron Paddick">
<text>Brian Leonard Paddick, Baron Paddick (born 24 April 1958), is a British life peer and retired police officer. He was the Liberal Democrat candidate for the London mayoral elections of 2008 and of 2012, and until his retirement in May 2007 was a deputy assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan Police Service.

Paddick joined the Metropolitan Police in 1976. Rising through the ranks, he was appointed the officer in charge of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) at Notting Hill in 1995, then returned to New Scotland Yard, first as Superintendent of the Personnel Department in 1996 and then as Chief Superintendent in 1997. In December 2000 he was appointed Police Commander for the London Borough of Lambeth, where he worked until 2002.

In the latter capacity, Paddick attracted controversy by instructing his police officers not to arrest or charge people found with cannabis so that they could focus on crimes that were affecting the quality of life in the borough to a greater extent.

In late 2002, the Crown Prosecution Service decided that no charges would be brought against him in relation to alleged cannabis possession; in December 2003 Paddick and &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; settled legal proceedings brought by him, with the newspaper accepting that a story it had published was false (which had alleged he had used cannabis), apologising, and paying damages.

In April 2005 Paddick took over management of territorial policing across all 32 London boroughs. During the investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) into the wrongful shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell Tube station on 22 July 2005, Paddick stated that a member of the private office team of Sir Ian Blair, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, had believed the wrong man had been targeted just six hours after the shooting. This allegation was contradicted by New Scotland Yard. On 28 March 2006, Paddick accepted a statement from the Metropolitan Police that it &quot;did not intend to imply&quot; a senior officer had misled the probe into the shooting and that &quot;any misunderstanding is regretted&quot;.

However, following the disagreement, Paddick was assigned the position of group director of information management at New Scotland Yard, which he considered a &quot;non-job&quot;. He came to accept that his police career was over, and retired from the police force on 31 May 2007. In November 2007, it was announced that Paddick had been selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Mayor of London in the mayoral elections to be held on 1 May 2008. He came third, behind Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone, winning 9.8 per cent of first preference votes.

Paddick was created a life peer in 2013, taking the title Baron Paddick, of Brixton in the London Borough of Lambeth, sitting in the House of Lords for the Liberal Democrats. He became a non-affiliated member of the Lords upon his appointment as a non-executive advisor for the Metropolitan Police in 2023.

==Early life==
Paddick was born on 24 April 1958 in Balham in London, England, and spent his early years in Mitcham and Tooting Bec. He was educated at Bec Grammar School in Tooting Bec, and at Sutton Manor High School (now Sutton Grammar School), in Sutton. He went on to take a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford and a Master of Business Administration at Warwick Business School, University of Warwick (1989–1990) on police scholarships; and also studied for a postgraduate Diploma in Policing and Applied Criminology at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. When he was at Oxford, he was Captain of the University Swimming Team and Vice-Captain of his college&#x27;s rugby team.

He is the twin brother of J. H. Paddick and the grandson of a policeman and the son of Anthony Henry J. Paddick and Evelyn Perkin. He is the second cousin once removed of actor and comedian Hugh Paddick.

==Police career==
Paddick joined the Metropolitan Police Service in 1976, living in Highbury and Limehouse while he worked for four years as a Constable in Holloway. Rising through the ranks, he served as a response team officer, community officer, detective, and as a member of the Territorial Support Group (commonly referred to as the TSG or riot squad). Paddick was a sergeant on the front line during the 1981 Brixton riot, an experience that shaped his attitudes about confrontational police action and strengthened his belief in community policing. He was appointed Inspector in Fulham in 1983, Chief Inspector of the Personnel Department of New Scotland Yard in 1986, a staff officer in 1991, and Chief Inspector in Brixton in 1993. During this period, he also worked in Deptford, Lewisham, Thornton Heath (where his brother was the local vicar) and Notting Hill while living in Sutton, Pimlico and Westminster, and for a while outside London. In 1995, Paddick became the officer in charge of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) at Notting Hill and was responsible for policing the Notting Hill Carnival.

Paddick returned to New Scotland Yard, first as Superintendent of the Personnel Department in 1996 and then as Chief Superintendent in 1997. He then served as Borough Commander for Merton for two and a half years (1997–1999), responsible for policing Wimbledon, Mitcham and Merton. After attending the Police Staff College in 2000, in December 2000 he was appointed Police Commander for the London Borough of Lambeth where he worked until 2002, fulfilling his ambition of becoming head of policing in Brixton. At Lambeth he had direct responsibility for 940 police officers and 230 support staff, and an annual budget of £37 million.

After a stint in the Specialist Crime Directorate, which deals with serious cases such as murder, kidnap and fraud, Paddick returned to borough-based policing, overseeing the northwest London boroughs of Barnet, Brent, Camden, Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Harrow, Hillingdon, and Islington between 2002 and 2003. He was also responsible for youth and community issues including Police Community Support Officers and police volunteers across the whole of London.

In November 2003 Paddick was promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissioner, and in April 2005 he took over management of Territorial Policing across all 32 London boroughs, with responsibility for 20,000 police officers and support staff. He was accountable for reducing &quot;volume crime&quot; in London (all offences up to and including rape in terms of seriousness) and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice. He was the national lead for the police service on disability and mental health issues for a year and a half. He was also in the media spotlight as the senior Metropolitan Police Service spokesman for the Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales and after the 7 July 2005 London bombings.

Following a widely publicised disagreement with Sir Ian Blair, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, over the wrongful shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell Tube station on 22 July 2005, Paddick was assigned the position of group director of information management, which he considered a &quot;non-job&quot;. Claiming that the Home Office had intervened for political reasons to ensure that Blair would not have to resign over the incident as it had occurred in the aftermath of 21 July 2005 London bombings, Paddick says he came to accept that his police career was over and that he would never achieve his goal of becoming a chief constable.

Paddick retired from the police force on 31 May 2007. He is currently a Visiting Fellow of Ashridge Business School near Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire, where he lectures on leadership, change management and diversity.

===Press controversy===
In 2001, as Commander for the London Borough of Lambeth, Paddick started to make postings on London web discussion forum Urban75. According to Paddick&#x27;s autobiography, he had initially contacted Urban75 as part of an Internet campaign against the Brixton-based Movement For Justice By Any Means Necessary (MFJ), which was campaigning for justice after the police killing of local Derek Bennett. He also attacked MFJ chairman Alex Owolade who was subsequently sacked from his employment with Lambeth London Borough Council.

At around this time, the national press also began coverage of the pilot cannabis programme in Brixton where officers were instructed not to arrest or charge people who were found to be in possession of cannabis. They were instead to issue on-the-spot warnings and confiscate the drugs. Although Paddick is credited with the idea, the pilot programme was sanctioned by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, Sir John Stevens.

Paddick argued that the policy allowed his officers to deal with cannabis quickly and informally, freeing them to concentrate on heroin and crack cocaine offences, as well as other offences such as street robbery and burglary, which he and others felt were affecting the quality of life in Lambeth to a greater extent. &quot;[P]olice officers said they weren&#x27;t prepared any longer to drop cannabis down the drain because one of their colleagues had been arrested by internal investigators apparently for doing just that. They were going to arrest everybody they found even with the smallest amount of cannabis. I couldn&#x27;t have allowed that to happen. They would have been doing nothing else.&quot;

Critics accused him of being soft on drugs, and the policy became a source of public controversy and debate. The situation worsened when &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; published a false story by his former partner, James Renolleau, that Commander Paddick had used cannabis himself. They also highlighted his homosexuality as a matter of concern, and claimed he was an anarchist based on a comment he had made on Urban75 in January 2002. In fact, he had written that &quot;the concept of anarchy has always appealed to me&quot;, but that he was &quot;not sure everyone would behave well if there were no laws and no system.&quot;
Following the controversy, Paddick was transferred to an intelligence position and the allegations were investigated by the Crown Prosecution Service. His transfer led to public rallies in Lambeth in his support. The CPS decided in late 2002 that no charges would be brought. In November 2003, Paddick was promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Territorial Policing. In a December 2003 out-of-court settlement, the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; accepted that their story was false, apologised, and paid damages.

The situation did, however, encourage the British government to re-evaluate its policies with regard to drugs, and reclassifying cannabis from a class B to a class C drug was suggested. Subsequently, the law was altered in February 2004.

In September 2007 Paddick commented: &quot;I always felt like a fish out of water in the police, not just on gay issues but generally. I was a very counter-cultural senior officer. I&#x27;m very non-hierarchical and got into trouble for insisting on people calling me by my first name. I was trying to effect the most difficult change there is in an organisation, which is a change of culture – to try to make it more liberal, more understanding of difference.&quot;

===Jean Charles de Menezes===

After the 21 July 2005 London bombings and the subsequent police shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes on 22 July 2005 at the Stockwell Tube station in London, Paddick met Stockwell community leaders. Kate Hoey, Member of Parliament for Vauxhall which covers the area, had requested the meeting to help reassure local residents.

Paddick was quoted by the BBC as stating, &quot;It was a very calm meeting. People were very understanding of the circumstances that these officers found themselves in. We expressed our sympathy to the family of the person who was tragically killed. It was a very measured meeting, but a very positive meeting.&quot; He would not promise that a similar tragedy would never happen again, but he stated it was not likely.

In March 2006 it was revealed that Paddick had consulted libel lawyers in connection with statements issued by Scotland Yard. In verbal and written statements to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) on their investigations into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, he had stated that a member of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Ian Blair&#x27;s private office team believed the wrong man had been targeted just six hours after the shooting. This was contrary to statements made at the time.

When this allegation became public following an unauthorised disclosure, Scotland Yard issued a statement claiming that the officer alleged to have believed this [Paddick] &quot;has categorically denied this in his interview with, and statement to, the IPCC investigators&quot;. The statement continued that they &quot;were satisfied that whatever the reasons for this suggestion being made, it is simply not true&quot;. Paddick&#x27;s interpretation of this statement was that it accused him of lying.

On 28 March 2006, Paddick accepted a statement from the Metropolitan Police that it &quot;did not intend to imply&quot; a senior officer had misled the probe into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said &quot;any misunderstanding is regretted&quot; and that Paddick had accepted its &quot;clarification&quot; and considered the matter closed.

In a lengthy interview with Paddick published in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on 17 November 2007 detailing his thinking on becoming London Mayor, he made a revealing comment possibly connected with difficulties that have arisen because of the de Menezes killing: &quot;Policing is a dangerous job, we should trust the professional judgement of officers on the front line. We shouldn&#x27;t prosecute them or their bosses if they decide to put their lives on the line for the public.&quot; In addition, on 26 November 2007 in &quot;The Independent&quot; Paddick was asked if Commissioner Ian Blair should have resigned over the de Menezes case. His response was: &quot;Yes. The public allows the police to use force on the understanding that someone will be held to account if something goes wrong. An innocent man was killed by the police and in the absence of any individual officer being held to account, the person at the top should take responsibility.&quot;

==Liberal Democrat candidate for Mayor of London==
In August 2006, it was reported by &quot;The Observer&quot;″s &quot;Pendennis&quot; column that Paddick was considering seeking selection as the Liberal Democrats&#x27; candidate for Mayor of London in the mayoral elections to be held in 2008. This was confirmed a year later by the BBC. He received an endorsement from Lynne Featherstone MP, a former member of the London Assembly, on her blog.

On 2 September 2007, Paddick informed &quot;Pink News&quot; of some of his priorities if elected mayor. On illegal drugs, he reiterated that they are &quot;dangerous and harmful and it is better if people live without them&quot;, but that he had a &quot;realistic approach&quot; to enforcement and would not be afraid of adopting a &quot;radical solution if it&#x27;s fully thought through, if it&#x27;s workable, affordable and gets the right result&quot;. He promised to regulate the timings of London&#x27;s buses and to apply the London congestion charge in a more sophisticated manner that differentiated wealthy chauffeur-driven chief executives from delivery drivers. As regards the 2012 Summer Olympics to be held in London, he pledged to ensure that &quot;the best possible show&quot; would be staged with &quot;value for money for every single pound spent&quot;. In addition, in a leaflet released on his campaign website on 10 September, he pledged to &quot;put more police officers, fully trained, equipped and with the necessary powers out on the street, dealing with violent gun and knife crime&quot;, to take the lead in tackling climate change and minimising the impact on the
environment by powering the London Underground with renewable energy, and to provide the right environment for business without interfering in businesses.

On 13 November 2007, it was announced that Paddick had been selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Mayor of London. He won 73% of the first preference votes during the selection contest. Paddick joined, among others, Ken Livingstone as the Labour candidate and Conservative Party candidate Boris Johnson. However, a poll conducted by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and ICM published on 3 April 2008 found that Paddick was the first choice of only 10% of voters. He therefore had little chance of winning, as 42% supported Johnson and 41% Livingstone. The poll was borne out by the results of the elections on 1 May 2008. On 3 May it was announced that Boris Johnson had been elected. Paddick was in third place behind Ken Livingstone, with 9.8% (236,685 out of 2,415,958) of the first preference votes.

===Liberal Democrat candidate for Mayor of London election 2012===

On Thursday 16 June 2011, it was reported that Paddick had entered nomination papers to stand once again for the Liberal Democrats in the 2012 London mayoral elections. On Friday 2 September he was selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate.

On election day itself, Paddick won 91,774 or 4.16% of the first preference votes, behind eventual winner Boris Johnson for the Conservatives, former mayor Ken Livingstone for Labour, and Greens candidate Jenny Jones. He lost almost half of his support compared to 2008, mainly attributed to the performance of the coalition government in Westminster and the popularity levels of the Liberal Democrats on a national scale.

==House of Lords activities==
Having been elevated to the House of Lords on 16 September 2013, he led a debate on the public trust of police, on 28 November 2013.

In the 2016 Autumn Party Convention, Lord Paddick saw the Liberty and Security Policy Paper produced by the working party he chaired accepted by the convention. This paper, while recognising the danger of terrorism, took issue with the Investigatory Powers Bill and the Counter-Extremism and Safeguarding Bill, rejecting &quot;the idea that indiscriminate monitoring or limiting of legal free speech enhances security.&quot;

In October 2023, Lord Paddick withdrew from Liberal Democrat whip following his appointment as a non-executive advisor with the Metropolitan Police. He will sit as a non-affiliated member for the duration of the appointment.

==Personal life==
Since childhood, Paddick has known he was gay, but between 1983 and 1988 he was married to Mary Stone in what he called &quot;a genuine attempt to live as a straight man&quot; – &quot;It&#x27;s what my faith as a Christian expected of me. It&#x27;s what my parents expected of me. It&#x27;s what the police service expected of me. Mary was a very beautiful and charming woman. It was a genuine attempt to try and deny my sexuality and to &#x27;do the right thing&#x27;.&quot; According to Paddick, it was &quot;a fairly conventional marriage&quot; and his former wife said it was &quot;a wonderful marriage&quot;. She did not know he was gay. He struggled with his sexuality until towards the end of his marriage in 1988: &quot;I learned the lesson about being yourself before that, and being open about my sexuality was the last piece in the jigsaw. I wasn&#x27;t open about my sexuality until I was a commander.&quot; A November 2003 profile in &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted: &quot;Mr Paddick is relaxed enough to laugh at himself and told a gay magazine: &#x27;My last staff officer got promoted and went to royalty protection. In his leaving card I wrote, &quot;Same job, different Queen&quot;.&#x27;&quot; Paddick currently lives in Vauxhall, London. He lived there previously with Petter Belsvik, a civil engineer from Oslo, Norway; they met in a bar while on holiday in Ibiza. They married in Oslo, same-sex marriage in Norway being legalised 8 days before, on 9 January 2009. Belsvik died at the end of February 2023.

Paddick was a contestant on the eighth series of the ITV1 reality television show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, which began its broadcast on 16 November 2008. On 1 December 2008, he became the sixth celebrity to be voted off the show. Interviewed by the show&#x27;s hosts Ant &amp; Dec after leaving the jungle, he explained his reasons for participating: &quot;For a long time I&#x27;ve been doing serious stuff. Thirty years in the police and running for mayor. It&#x27;s all bad news that they want me to comment on. So I thought why not come and do something trivial. ... It&#x27;s the hardest thing I&#x27;ve ever done in my life, anything after this is a breeze.&quot;

In 2008, Paddick was ranked number 101 in the annual Pink List of influential gay and lesbian people in Britain published by &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, down from number 83 in 2007.

In 2010, Paddick appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s alternative election night special of &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot; alongside Edwina Currie, Rod Liddle and Derek Hatton.

Speaking about his marriage in Norway as part of the 2010 Liberal Democrat debate about equal marriage for gay people, Paddick said: &quot;The real impact of [marriage rather than a civil partnership], the symbolism of it, the importance of it, didn&#x27;t really strike me until we stood in front of the judge in the courthouse in Oslo, and she said ... we&#x27;re here today to witness the marriage of Brian and Petter. And that was an intensely moving experience. We really feel, my husband and I, that we are really equal because we are married.&quot;

In July 2018, Paddick revealed that he was a participant in the PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) medication trials being carried out at the time by the NHS in England. The medication is used to prevent HIV-negative people from acquiring HIV.

<text>The Sager House () or Sager Palace (&quot;Sagerska palatset&quot;) is the official residence of the Prime Minister of Sweden, located at Strömgatan 18 in central Stockholm.

== Location ==
The Sager House is located in the Stockholm borough of Norrmalm, on the street Strömgatan, on the north side of the river Norrström.

===Adjacent landmarks===
The Sager House lies between: Rosenbad, the Government Chancellery (on the west); and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (the former Arvfurstens Palats) and the Royal Swedish Opera on Gustav Adolfs torg (on the east).

It lies across from the Parliament House (Riksdag) building (on the island Helgeandsholmen), and the Royal Palace (on the island Stadsholmen), and is connected with them over the river Norrström through the Riksbron and Norrbro bridges, respectively.

==History==
The first historical records of a building on the site are from the 1640s. In 1880 the property was purchased by the Sager brothers. The Sager Palace was owned by the Sager family from 1880 to 1986.

In 1988 the building was purchased by the Swedish State to be turned into the official residence of the Prime Minister of Sweden. Before it was bought, there was no official residence in Stockholm for the head of government. The first Prime Minister to use the building after an extensive renovation for its new use was Göran Persson (1996–2006). Fredrik Reinfeldt moved in after the 2006 Swedish general election.

===Architecture===
In 1893 Robert Sager had the palace remodeled, including the addition of a new floor within a Mansard roof and a French Baroque Revival style facade with Neo-Rococo details, that are still seen.

<text>Cannon and Ball were an English double act comprising Tommy Cannon and Bobby Ball, who met in the early 1960s while working as welders in Oldham, Lancashire. They started as singers working the pubs and clubs of Greater Manchester and switched to comedy after being told comics earned an extra £3 a night. They continued to work as a comic duo on television and in theatre and pantomime. Their variety show &quot;The Cannon and Ball Show&quot; lasted for nine years on ITV. Ball died on 28 October, 2020, following a COVID-19 diagnosis.

==TV and film==
Their first TV appearance was as contestants in talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;. In 1974 they appeared in variety series &quot;The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club&quot; before, in 1978, landing slots on &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Big Night&quot;. In 1979, LWT offered them their own series, &quot;The Cannon and Ball Show&quot;, which premiered on ITV on 28 July 1979. Further series followed each year through to 1988, along with Christmas and Easter specials.

They were the subjects of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1981 when they were surprised by Eamonn Andrews outside the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London.

In 1982, they appeared in a feature film, &quot;The Boys in Blue&quot;, based loosely on the Will Hay film &quot;Ask a Policeman&quot;. &quot;The Boys in Blue&quot; was regarded critically as weak in comparison, and was their only cinema outing.

They also featured in a comic strip, &quot;Rock On, Tommy&quot; (titled after Ball&#x27;s onstage catchphrase), published in the magazine &quot;Look-in&quot;.

Their popularity coincided with the rise of alternative comedy, with its emphasis on more socially relevant and political concerns. Cannon and Ball&#x27;s popularity began to decline, though they were not the only comedy act to suffer as comic tastes shifted. During the 1980s, Greg Dyke, then Head of Programming at ITV station TVS and later to hold a similar position at LWT, expressed a concern that northern comedy shows may not suit southern tastes.

By the 1990s, the duo were seeking a change in direction and appeared in their own sitcom &quot;Cannon and Ball&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, the spin-off series &quot;Plaza Patrol&quot; and their game show &quot;Cannon and Ball&#x27;s Casino&quot;. &quot;Plaza Patrol&quot; saw them play security guards in a shopping mall.

==Later years==

In the later years of their career, they continued to find success as a comic duo in theatre and pantomime, along with numerous cameo appearances on TV. In late 2005, they appeared in the British reality TV series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!,&quot; presented by Ant &amp; Dec.

They admitted that, during their hey-day of huge popularity in the 1980s, they were barely on speaking terms and would avoid each other completely when not on stage or rehearsing. These tensions—which lasted for 3 years - were later resolved and the two became very close once again.

In 2010, they were panellists on the BBC Radio 4 comedy panel show &quot;Act Your Age&quot;. They appeared in a celebrity edition of &quot;Coach Trip&quot; on Channel 4 in 2012. In 2018 they appeared in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Last Laugh in Vegas&quot;.

==Tours==
The pair revived a touring version of the theatrical farce Big Bad Mouse, originally a highly successful vehicle for Jimmy Edwards and Eric Sykes in the 1960s and 1970s. This incarnation of the show featured Cannon and Ball in the starring roles. The show opened in Hull during May 2008 and toured six other cities, before ending in August at the Theatre Royal, Windsor, to mixed reviews.

==Religion==
The pair became devout Christians and published a book called &quot;Christianity for Beginners&quot;. Ball became a born-again Christian in 1986 and Cannon in 1992, their conversions having a lot to do with the re-kindling of their broken friendship. They regularly featured in their own gospel and &quot;an audience with...&quot; show in churches around the country.

==Other work==
Also in 2008, the pair&#x27;s career continued as they appeared on television as the faces of Safestyle UK, a Bradford-based double glazing firm. The pair starred in pantomimes at the Theatre Royal, Lincoln including Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Cinderella and in 2014 appeared in Jack and the Beanstalk. They also made several appearances in the sitcom &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;.

<text>Rosenbad (, lit. &quot;rosen bath&quot;) is a building in central Stockholm, precinct of Norrmalm. It is a building owned by the Swedish State and serves as the seat of the Government. The present government of Sweden is the right-leaning Kristersson Cabinet.

Rosenbad is located on &quot;Strömgatan&quot; on the north side of the river Norrström. It was designed by Art Nouveau architect Ferdinand Boberg, and completed in 1902. It originally housed a variety of functions, including a restaurant (until 1956) of the same name. Renovation of the entire block began in autumn 2018, and is expected to be completed in spring 2023. In the meantime, the Government Offices are housed in surrounding blocks.

==Government building==
Rosenbad now functions as the seat for Prime Minister&#x27;s Office () and the Government Offices (). It is located close to the Sager House, the official residence of the Prime Minister. The Riksdag building and the Royal Palace are located across the waters of Stockholms ström.

<doc id="322949" wikidata="Q2571972" url="?curid=322949" title="Decree">
<text>A decree is a legal proclamation, usually issued by a head of state, judge, royal figure, or other relevant authorities, according to certain procedures. These procedures are usually defined by the constitution, Legislative laws, or customary laws of a government.

==Belgium==

In Belgium, a decree is a law of a community or regional parliament, e.g. the Flemish Parliament.
==Catholic Church==

A decree (Latin: &quot;decretum&quot;) in the usage of the canon law of the Catholic Church has various meanings. Any papal bull, brief, or motu proprio is a decree inasmuch as these documents are legislative acts of the pope. In this sense, the term is quite ancient. The Roman Congregations were formerly empowered to issue decrees in matters which come under their particular jurisdiction but were forbidden from continuing to do so under Pope Benedict XV in 1917. Each ecclesiastical province and also each diocese may issue decrees in their periodical synods within their sphere of authority.

While in a general sense all documents promulgated by an ecumenical council can be called decrees, in a specific sense some of these documents, as at the Second Vatican Council, were called more precisely constitutions or declarations.

Canon 29 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law defines general decrees:
===Holy See===
The Holy See uses decrees from the pope such as papal bull, papal brief or motu proprio as legislative acts.

==France==

The word , literally &quot;decree&quot;, is an old legal usage in France and is used to refer to executive orders issued by the French President or Prime Minister. Any such order must not violate the French Constitution or Civil Code, and a party has the right to request an order be annulled in the French Council of State. Orders must be ratified by Parliament before they can be modified into legislative Acts. Special orders known as , literally &quot;decree-act&quot; or &quot;decree-law&quot;, usually considered an illegal practice under the 3rd and 4th Republic, were finally abolished and replaced by the regulations under the 1958 Constitution.

Except for the reserve powers of the President (as stated in Art. 16 of the 1958 Constitution, exercised only once so far), the executive can issue decrees in areas that the Constitution grants as the responsibility of Parliament only if a law authorizes it to do so. In other cases, orders are illegal and, should anyone sue for the order&#x27;s annulment, it would be voided by the Council of State. There exists a procedure for the Prime Minister to issue ordinances in such areas, but this procedure requires Parliament&#x27;s express consent (see Art 38 of the 1958 Constitution).

Orders issued by the Prime Minister take two forms:
* Orders ();
* Orders-in-council (), when a statute mandates the advisory consultation of the Council of State.

Sometimes, people refer to improperly as . This would imply that it is the Council of State that makes the decree, whereas the power of decreeing is restricted to the president or prime minister; the role of the administrative sections of the council is purely advisory.

Decrees may be classified into:
* Regulations, which may be:
** Application decrees (), each of which must be specifically authorized by one or more statutes to determine some implementation conditions of this or these statutes; these constitute secondary legislation and are roughly equivalent to British statutory instruments;
** Autonomous regulations (), which may be taken only in areas where the Constitution does not impose statute law (passed by the Legislature); these constitute primary legislation;
* Particular measures, such as the nomination of high-level civil servants.

Only the prime minister may issue regulatory or application decrees. Presidential decrees are generally nominations or exceptional measures where the law mandates a presidential decree, such as the dissolution of the French National Assembly, the calling of new legislative elections, and the grant of the title Marshal of France.

Decrees are published in the (&quot;French Gazette&quot;).

==Russia==

According to the Russian Federation&#x27;s 1993 constitution, an is a presidential decree. Such an has the force of law, but may not alter the Russian constitution or the regulations of existing laws, and may be superseded by laws passed by the Federal Assembly.

The Government of Russia can also issue decrees formally called Decisions ( or Orders ( ) and may not contradict the constitution/laws or presidential decrees.

==Saudi Arabia==
Royal decrees, along with the Sharia, are the sources of law in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

==Spain==
In Spain, decrees come in several forms:
* Royal decree
* Royal Decree-Law
* Royal Legislative Decree

==Turkey==
The decree law (Turkish: &quot;Kanun Hükmünde Kararname, KHK&quot;) in Turkey is a type of legislative instrument issued by the government, based on the authority granted either by a specific enabling act from the legislative body or directly from the Constitution. These decrees have the force of law in a material sense and acquire formal and organic legal power upon the approval of the parliament. According to Article 87 of the 1982 Constitution of Turkey, granting the Council of Ministers the authority to issue decree laws on specific matters is included in the duties and powers of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.

Article 91 of the Constitution also regulates the issuance of decree laws. It states:&quot;The Grand National Assembly of Turkey may delegate the power to issue decree laws to the Council of Ministers. However, with the exception of martial law and states of emergency, the fundamental rights, individual rights and duties, and political rights and duties listed in the first and second sections of the second part of the Constitution cannot be regulated by decree laws.&quot;Decree laws in Turkey are categorized into two types: ordinary and extraordinary. Ordinary decree laws are issued by the Council of Ministers and require an enabling act from the Grand National Assembly. They cannot regulate fundamental rights, individual rights and duties, or political rights and duties. Extraordinary decree laws, on the other hand, are issued by the Council of Ministers under the presidency of the President. They do not require an enabling act from the Grand National Assembly and can regulate any area, provided they fulfill obligations arising from international law. Decree laws are subject to both political scrutiny by the parliament and judicial review by the Constitutional Court.

Following the approval of the 2017 constitutional amendment referendum in Turkey and the 2018 general elections, which led to the election of the President by popular vote, Article 91 of the Constitution was repealed. With this change, decree laws were replaced by Presidential Decrees (Turkish: &quot;Cumhurbaşkanlığı Kararnameleri, CBK&quot;) in the new system.

==United Kingdom==

In the United Kingdom, Orders-in-Council are either primary legislation deriving their authority from the royal prerogative, promulgated by the Privy Council in the name of the Monarch; or secondary legislation, promulgated by a minister of the Crown using the authority granted by an act of Parliament or other primary legislation. Both are subject to judicial review, the former with some exceptions.

==United States==

In US legal usage, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, a decree was an order of a court of equity determining the rights of the parties to a suit, according to equity and good conscience. Since the 1938 procedural merger of law and equity in the federal courts under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the term &quot;judgment&quot; (the parallel term in the common law) has generally replaced &quot;decree&quot;. This is now true also in most state courts. The term &quot;decree&quot; is broadly treated as synonymous with &quot;judgment&quot;.

A decree is often a final determination, but there are also interlocutory decrees. A &quot;final decree&quot; fully and finally disposes of the whole litigation, determining all questions raised by the case, and it leaves nothing that requires further judicial action; it is also appealable. An &quot;interlocutory decree&quot; is a provisional or preliminary order that determines issues of fact or law in advance of a final decree, but leaves other issues to be resolved and thus does not resolve the litigation. It is usually not appealable, although preliminary injunctions by federal courts are appealable even though interlocutory.

Executive orders, which are instructions from the President to the executive branch of government, are decrees in the general sense in that they have the force of law, although they cannot override statute law or the Constitution and are subject to judicial review. Governors of individual states may also issue state executive orders.

<text>David Murray, 5th Viscount of Stormont (1665 – 19 November 1731) was a Scottish Jacobite peer.

==Biography==
He was the son of David Murray, 4th Viscount Stormont (died 1668), and Lady Jean Carnegie, daughter of James Carnegie, 2nd Earl of Southesk and Lady Mary Kerr, daughter of Robert Ker, 1st Earl of Roxburghe

In 1689, Stormont was summoned to attend the Committee of Estates in Edinburgh in the wake of the Glorious Revolution. He failed to attend and was declared a rebel by the Privy Council of Scotland. Four years later he was fined for failing to attend the Parliament of Scotland. Despite subsequently taking an oath of allegiance to Queen Anne, he made little secret of his Jacobite politics. He opposed the Acts of Union 1707.

Between 1705 and 1707 he was in regular correspondence and contact with Jacobite agents in Scotland and France. In advance of the planned French invasion of Britain in 1708, Stormont received instructions from James Francis Edward Stuart, but he was taken into custody for three months, on suspicion, by the government in Edinburgh. He was arrested again on suspicion during the Jacobite rising of 1715, having hosted the Pretender at Scone Palace for three weeks during the rising. He was described by Nathaniel Hooke as being &quot;rich, powerful and strongly determined&quot; in the Jacobite interest.

==Marriage and issue==
On 31 January 1688, he married Marjory Scott (d. 8 April 1746), daughter of David Scott of Scotstarvit (d. 1718). The couple had the following children:

<text>Ian MacDougall Hacking (February 18, 1936 – May 10, 2023) was a Canadian philosopher specializing in the philosophy of science. Throughout his career, he won numerous awards, such as the Killam Prize for the Humanities and the Balzan Prize, and was a member of many prestigious groups, including the Order of Canada, the Royal Society of Canada and the British Academy.

== Life and career ==
Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, he earned undergraduate degrees from the University of British Columbia (1956) and the University of Cambridge (1958), where he was a student at Trinity College. Hacking also earned his PhD at Cambridge (1962) under the direction of Casimir Lewy, a former student of G. E. Moore.

Hacking started his teaching career as an instructor at Princeton University in 1960 but, after just one year, moved to the University of Virginia as an assistant professor. After working as a research fellow at Peterhouse, Cambridge from 1962 to 1964, he taught at his alma mater, UBC, first as an assistant professor and later as an associate professor from 1964 to 1969. He became a lecturer at Cambridge, again a member of Peterhouse, in 1969 before moving to Stanford University in 1974. After teaching for several years at Stanford, he spent a year at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Bielefeld, Germany, from 1982 to 1983. Hacking was promoted to Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto in 1983 and University Professor, the highest honour the University of Toronto bestows on faculty, in 1991. From 2000 to 2006, he held the Chair of Philosophy and History of Scientific Concepts at the Collège de France. Hacking is the first Anglophone to be elected to a permanent chair in the Collège&#x27;s history. After retiring from the Collège de France, Hacking was a professor of philosophy at UC Santa Cruz, from 2008 to 2010. He concluded his teaching career in 2011 as a visiting professor at the University of Cape Town.

Hacking was married three times: his first two marriages, to Laura Anne Leach and fellow philosopher Nancy Cartwright, ended in divorce. His third marriage, to Judith Baker, also a philosopher, lasted until her death in 2014. He had two daughters and a son, as well as one stepson.

Hacking died from heart failure at a retirement home in Toronto on May 10, 2023, at the age of 87.

==Philosophical work==
Influenced by debates involving Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, Paul Feyerabend and others, Hacking is known for bringing a historical approach to the philosophy of science. The fourth edition (2010) of Feyerabend&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;Against Method,&quot; and the 50th anniversary edition (2012) of Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; include an Introduction by Hacking. He is sometimes described as a member of the &quot;Stanford School&quot; in philosophy of science, a group that also includes John Dupré, Nancy Cartwright and Peter Galison. Hacking himself identified as a Cambridge analytic philosopher. Hacking was a main proponent of a realism about science called &quot;entity realism.&quot; This form of realism encourages a realistic stance towards answers to the scientific unknowns hypothesized by mature sciences (of the future), but skepticism towards current scientific theories. Hacking has also been influential in directing attention to the experimental and even engineering practices of science, and their relative autonomy from theory. Because of this, Hacking moved philosophical thinking a step further than the initial historical, but heavily theory-focused, turn of Kuhn and others.

After 1990, Hacking shifted his focus somewhat from the natural sciences to the human sciences, partly under the influence of the work of Michel Foucault. Foucault was an influence as early as 1975 when Hacking wrote &quot;Why Does Language Matter to Philosophy?&quot; and &quot;The Emergence of Probability&quot;. In the latter book, Hacking proposed that the modern schism between subjective or personalistic probability, and the long-run frequency interpretation, emerged in the early modern era as an epistemological &quot;break&quot; involving two incompatible models of uncertainty and chance. As history, the idea of a sharp break has been criticized, but competing &#x27;frequentist&#x27; and &#x27;subjective&#x27; interpretations of probability still remain today. Foucault&#x27;s approach to knowledge systems and power is also reflected in Hacking&#x27;s work on the historical mutability of psychiatric disorders and institutional roles for statistical reasoning in the 19th century, his focus in &quot;The Taming of Chance&quot; (1990) and other writings. He labels his approach to the human sciences transcendental nominalism (also dynamic nominalism or dialectical realism), a historicised form of nominalism that traces the mutual interactions over time between the phenomena of the human world and our conceptions and classifications of them.

In &quot;Mad Travelers&quot; (1998) Hacking provided a historical account of the effects of a medical condition known as fugue in the late 1890s. Fugue, also known as &quot;mad travel,&quot; is a diagnosable type of insanity in which European men would walk in a trance for hundreds of miles without knowledge of their identities.

== Awards and lectures ==
In 2002, Hacking was awarded the first Killam Prize for the Humanities, Canada&#x27;s most distinguished award for outstanding career achievements. He was made a Companion of the Order of Canada (CC) in 2004. Hacking was appointed visiting professor at University of California, Santa Cruz for the Winters of 2008 and 2009. On August 25, 2009, Hacking was named winner of the Holberg International Memorial Prize, a Norwegian award for scholarly work in the arts and humanities, social sciences, law and theology.

In 2003, he gave the Sigmund H. Danziger Jr. Memorial Lecture in the Humanities, and in 2010 he gave the René Descartes Lectures at the Tilburg Center for Logic and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS). Hacking also gave the Howison lectures at the University of California, Berkeley, on the topic of mathematics and its sources in human behavior (&#x27;Proof, Truth, Hands and Mind&#x27;) in 2010. In 2012, Hacking was awarded the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art, and in 2014 he was awarded the Balzan Prize.

<text>Marcus Popillius Laenas was a four-time consul of the Roman Republic. In the year (according to Varro) 359 BC, he defeated a Gallic army.

Near the end of his consulship with Gnaeus Manlius Capitolinus Imperiosus, the Tarquinians invaded the Roman territories on the Etruscan border, if this Gallic war took place 30 years after the occupation of Rome by the Gauls (in 386/5 BC). Dio Cassius apparently identifies this war with the one in Camillus&#x27;s fifth dictatorship when the election of the consuls was resumed. Those events took place in 364 BC, about a decade earlier, according to Livy.

He is named by Cicero as &quot;flamen Carmentalis&quot;, the flamen of Carmenta, in 359 BC.

==Name==
The name is a result of a progressive evolution. Similar to many older institutions, their teams were long referred to by the school&#x27;s colours as the Garnet and Grey (). Eventually, members of the media began to refer to the teams simply as the ‘GGs’, providing a nickname in both English and French for the bilingual school&#x27;s teams. The nickname stuck and would eventually be combined with a horse racing term (where a gee-gee is the first horse out of the starting gate) to create the current &quot;Gee-Gees&quot; team name.

===2010–2012===
In July 2010, the University of Ottawa appointed James Derouin, an alumnus and former player, as their new head coach after the departure of Coach Dave DeAveiro, who left for McGill University. Derouin was an assistant coach for the UBC Thunderbirds for the previous two years and was captain of the Gee-Gees men&#x27;s basketball team for both the 2000–01 and 2001–02 seasons. In his final year, he also played under DeAveiro.

The 11-win 2010–11 season was successful despite falling just short of an entrance to the Final 8, losing to the McMaster Marauders in the OUA Final 4.

The 2011–12 regular season was more successful than the previous year. The Gee-Gees entered the OUA playoffs with a 13–9 record but were ousted by rival Ryerson Rams by 3 points in the semifinals. The Gee-Gees had a playoff-experienced mix of veteran and young players going into the 2012–13 season.

===2012–2014===

The Gee-Gees came into the 2012–13 season with the last chance to make a deep run with star Warren Ward and the rest of their graduating players.

Highly ranked nationally all season, the Gee-Gees posted a 15–5 regular-season record and were dead-set on making an appearance in the CIS tournament. The team lost to bitter cross-city rivals Carleton Ravens by 3 points in the OUA Wilson Cup final, still qualifying for the CIS Final 8 Tournament being held in Ottawa. The team lost to the Lakehead Thunderwolves in the national championship semifinals but defeated the Acadia Axemen to earn their first national medal in school history with a bronze.

The 2013–14 season was one of the best in school history with the play of star senior Johnny Berhanemeskel and star transfer Terry Thomas the Gee-Gees were ranked at #2 in the nation almost all season and posted a school-best 20–2 regular-season record with their two losses coming against nation&#x27;s #1 Carleton. The Gee-Gees went into the OUA playoffs as the second seed and narrowly beat the Ryerson Rams to advance to the final four in Toronto. In the semifinals, Ottawa easily beat McMaster and advanced to the gold medal game against Carleton the following day. In the final, the Gee-Gees edged Carleton by a score of 78–77 to win their first Wilson Cup (basketball) in 21 years. The loss was Carleton&#x27;s first against Canadian competition in 49 straight games. Sitting on seed 1 for the Final 8 in the W. P. McGee Trophy, the Gee-Gees advanced to the final game, beating the Saskatchewan Huskies and the Victoria Vikes. The second time this season facing Carleton, in the National Championship final game, the Gee-Gees lost this time, 79–67.

==Women&#x27;s soccer==
The Gee-Gees women&#x27;s soccer program was founded in 1994 by current head coach Steven Johnson. The team went on to become national champions in 1996, in just their third season of play, after which Johnson was recognized as CIAU coach of the year (an honour he would again receive in 2005). The team has also won CIS silver medals in 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2005 and CIS bronze medals in 2001 and 2006. They went on to win the OUA gold in 2014, and CIS bronze following in 2014 along with receiving the Ottawa Sports Award. They won OUA bronze in 2015.

The University of Ottawa women&#x27;s soccer team became national champions on November 11, 2018, with a 2–1 victory over the Trinity Western Spartans in front of a home crowd. Miranda Smith scored the game-winning goal to bring the university its first national soccer title since 1996. This was their first finals appearance since 2005, led by long-time head coach Steve Johnson. The Gee-Gees finished atop the OUA East with a 14–1–1 record.

== Women&#x27;s rugby ==
Jen Boyd served as head coach from 2013-2023, leading the team to seven straight national medals as the first full-time head coach in women&#x27;s rugby. The Gee-Gees rugby team finally won their first national championship in 2017 after defeating the Laval Rouge et Or by a score of 20–10. The following year the Gee-Gees would fall short, finishing third in the tournament by defeating Laval 20–19, after a perfect 7–0 season to claim the RSEQ championship. Boyd was replaced after an external investigation which led to the implementation of a new safe sport program and replaced with Duncan McNaughton prior to the 2023 season. McNaughton will retire following the 2024 season to make way for Canada Senior Women&#x27;s Sevens head coach Jack Hanratty, who most recently won led the team to a silver medal at the Paris Olympics.

==Men&#x27;s hockey==
The men&#x27;s hockey program was formed in 1889. The team played in the Ottawa City Hockey League. The team was first known as &quot;Garnet and Grey&quot;, as well as the other varsity athletic programs within the University of Ottawa. In the 1940s, all the varsity athletic programs became known as the &quot;Gee-Gees&quot;, which was nicknamed by the media. The Gee-Gees had tremendous success in the 1980s. Despite, that the Gee-Gees have yet to win the University Cup. Ottawa&#x27;s most memorable run took place in 2004, as the Gee-Gees ousted their rival UQTR Patriotes 2–1 in the OUA playoffs, and then advanced to the Queen&#x27;s Cup, hosted by the University of Western Ontario. The Gee-Gees lost the OUA final to York, but they still earned a spot in the University Cup, held in Fredericton, New Brunswick, where the power-house UNB Varsity Reds played host to the tournament. However, the Gee-Gees failed to record a win and went home 0–2. Notably, it was the first time since 1985 that the Gee-Gees played in the University Cup.

The Gee-Gees are well known for their successful coaches like Mickey Goulet, who is the former head coach of the Italian National Men&#x27;s Hockey Team, which participated in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy. Coaches like Michel Boucher, Tony Zappia, and Dave Leger.

The Gee-Gees played in several rinks before the current Minto Sports Complex, which was built on the site of the Minto Arena, the former Minto Skating Club facility, which was demolished in 2000. Ottawa has held games at the Sandy Hill Arena and the Robert Guertin Arena in Hull. The first rink was known as &quot;College Yard&quot;, which was an outdoor rink in front of Tabaret Hall. The second venue for the Gee-Gees was the indoor Rideau Skating Rink, which was flooded during winter for the ice surface. The site on the corner of Waller Street and Laurier Avenue is now the Arts building at the University of Ottawa.

===2014–2016 suspension===
On March 3, 2014, the University of Ottawa men&#x27;s varsity hockey team was suspended from any activity due to &quot;severe misconduct&quot;. In a press conference, the university stated that they alerted the police due to the severity of the allegations. It was later discovered that some of the players on the hockey team were allegedly involved in a gang sexual assault on the weekend of February 1 while in Thunder Bay playing Lakehead University.

University of Ottawa officials were made aware of the situation by a third party on February 24, 2014. University officials gave information to Thunder Bay police, who confirmed they were in the initial stages of an investigation regarding a sexual assault. The University of Ottawa conducted its own review which called for the initial suspension while the investigation was ongoing. The university also contacted Ottawa police about the allegations, who in turn, cooperated with Thunder Bay police to complete the investigation.

During a press conference on March 3, 2014, the president of the university, Allan Rock, stated that the university was going to announce the suspension of the hockey program on February 28, 2014, but the Thunder Bay Police asked them to delay.

Two former players ultimately faced charges related to the incident. In June 2014, Rock announced uOttawa would not ice a team in 2014–15. January 2015, Rock announced that uOttawa would sit out the 2015–16 season as well in order to give university officials more time to implement reforms. The two former players were found not guilty of sexual assault in a verdict from Ontario Court Justice Chantal M. Brochu on June 25, 2018. The team returned for the 2016–17 season.

== Women&#x27;s hockey ==
== Women&#x27;s ringette ==
While technically not considered a varsity team, Ottawa has a university ringette team which competes annually in the Canadian national University Challenge Cup.

== Varsity rowing ==
Rowing at the University of Ottawa was established in 1949 after the athletic department created the Physical Education Program for aspiring oarsmen. The Ottawa Rowing Club offered equipment and coaches and continues to host the team to this day.

GeeGees rowers have compete annually in the P.D. Ross Regatta. The regatta was first held in 1950, following the death of the regatta&#x27;s namesake, and the race was structured as a duel between the men&#x27;s eight crews from University of Ottawa and McMaster University. The annual race has since been modified to feature the top men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s crews from University of Ottawa and Carleton University. The P.D. Ross regatta is raced annually on the Rideau Canal between the Bank Street and Pretoria bridges in early September. At its peak the regatta hosted 10,000 spectators.

<text>The Baghdad Zoo is a zoo originally opened in 1971 and located in Baghdad, Iraq, in the Al-Zawraa Park area along with the Al Zawra’a Dream Park (amusement park) and Zawra&#x27;a Tower. Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the zoo housed 650 animals. After being nearly destroyed during the 2003 Iraqi war, when only about 35 animals survived, the zoo was reopened in 2003 and now houses about 1,070 animals.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

The Baghdad Zoo was built in 1971 under Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr.

The facilities were insufficient, with small confinement spaces considered inhumane. After the first Gulf War, Iraq&#x27;s zoos suffered from the United Nations Iraq sanctions, limited particular foods, medicines, and vaccines.

Saddam Hussein closed the zoo for renovations in the spring of 2002.

=== 2003 invasion ===
The zoo was destroyed during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. For their own safety, zoo workers suspended feeding the animals in early April 2003, when Fedayeen Saddam troops took up defensive positions around the zoo as U.S. forces began the battle of Baghdad. Out of the original 650 to 700 animals in the Baghdad Zoo only 35 had survived to the eighth day of the invasion, and these tended to be some of the larger animals.

During the absence of zoo staff and officials, the zoo suffered from severe looting. Cages were torn open by thieves who released or took hundreds of animals and birds. Zoo staff said most of the birds and game animals were taken for food as pre-war food shortages in Baghdad were exacerbated by the invasion.

Many animals were found roaming the zoo grounds. The remaining animals were found in critical condition, dying of thirst and starving in their cages, including Mandor, a 20-year-old Siberian tiger that was the personal property of Uday Hussein, and Saida, a blind brown bear.

Several lions escaped from the abandoned zoo and were rounded up by American soldiers in armored fighting vehicles. Four that would not return to their cages were shot by the soldiers. Comics author Brian K. Vaughan wrote the fictionalized graphic novel &quot;Pride of Baghdad&quot; based on the lions, giving each speech and a personality.

=== Rebuilding the zoo ===
In mid-April 2003 South African conservationist Lawrence Anthony from the Thula Thula Game Reserve in Zululand, traveled in a hired car with two assistants from Kuwait to bring relief to the Baghdad Zoo, the first civilians to gain entry to Iraq after the invasion. Working with the Baghdad Zoo directors Dr. Adel Salman Mousa and Dr. Husham Mohamed Hussan and a few returning staff they began caring for and feeding the remaining animals, restoring basic hygiene standards, and stabilizing the situation. Anthony&#x27;s journey to the zoo was delayed by safety and bureaucracy issues in the chaos of the war, and he arrived at the zoo 8 days after the invasion and started to rescue the surviving animals.

U.S. Army Captain William Sumner of the 354th Civil Affairs Brigade was the military officer in charge of the zoo and joined the team improving security and stemming the tide of looters. He appointed Anthony as interim zoo administrator, and remained in charge of the zoo for 14 months. He departed with his brigade in March 2004. Iraqi veteran Farah Murrani joined the rescue effort with Brendan Whittington-Jones of the Thula Thula game reserve. At various times they were joined by other conservation organizations including Wildaid, Care for the Wild International, and IFAW.

The zoo and surrounding park reopened to the public on July 20, 2003, following improvements and renovations by US Army engineers and featured 86 animals, including all 19 surviving lions. Most of these animals were rescued after the invasion from menageries at the Hussein family palaces and private zoos around Baghdad during the ongoing conflict, and included lions, tigers, brown bears, wolves, foxes, jackals, camels, ostriches, badgers, and some primates.

Whittington-Jones and Murrani remained at the zoo for another year during which time they also found homes in the US for over 30 Baghdad street dogs.

The story of the rescue of the Baghdad zoo is recounted in the book &quot;Babylon&#x27;s Ark&quot; by authors Lawrence Anthony and Graham Spence. A more recent book for children called &quot;Saving the Baghdad Zoo, a True Story of Hope and Heroes&quot;, was released on February 9, 2010.

=== Setbacks ===
On September 18, 2003, a group of U.S. Army Reserve soldiers and Iraqi police held a party in the zoo after it had closed. Sergeant Keith Mitchell of the 422nd Civil Affairs Battalion had his right arm severely mauled by a male Bengal tiger; a soldier, seeing the attack, initially shot and wounded the tiger, when this failed to stop the tiger a final shot fatally wounded the caged animal which bled to death. One report says that Mitchell was trying to feed the tiger a chicken kabob, but Mitchell denied this. The initial reports of drunkenness by the soldiers led to public condemnation, but Mitchell said he had one beer. Tests were not performed until the next morning on a half-dozen of the soldiers which found no evidence of alcohol. Court martial proceedings occurred in Washington, D.C., where Mitchell was exonerated of charges. Mitchell&#x27;s rank was restored after a three-month probationary period. The tiger underwent a necropsy, in which no foreign food was found in its digestive tract, nor was any found around or near the cage. The event inspired a play titled &quot;Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo&quot;, which was staged by the Center Theatre Group in Los Angeles in 2009 and 2010. Mitchell received an honorable medical discharge in 2006, but died from complications of diabetes, something he developed during the 24 reconstructive surgeries on his arm, in April, 2007, leaving a wife and one daughter. The North Carolina–based Conservators&#x27; Center, an exotic-wildlife conservation and preservation center, offered to donate two mix-breed tiger cubs to the Baghdad Zoo. After considerable legal and bureaucratic hurdles the tigers were delivered to the zoo on August 4, 2008. They were a male, Riley, and a female, Hope.

In 2009, three wild boars at the zoo were euthanized due to fears that they could get infected with the A/H1N1 flu virus (Swine flu).

=== Recovery ===

In 2008, the zoo had grown to about 800 animals, though most of these were birds. The only large animals at the zoo were two female lions left from the 22 original lions before the invasion. On August 4, 2008, the zoo received two tiger cubs (Hope and Riley) from the Mebane, North Carolina–based Conservators&#x27; Center, an exotic-wildlife conservation and preservation center.

By 2009, the zoo reported that they had about 1070 animals. To keep visitors safe, Zawraa Park, in which the zoo is located, is guarded by the special police units that guard other government facilities. Visitors are frisked and bags and baskets are checked for explosives. Although numbers cannot be verified, the director general of parks and gardens, Salah Abu al-Lail, expected close to 8 million visitors to the park in 2009.

<text>Stadsholmen is the historical name of an island in the centre of Stockholm, Sweden. Stadsholmen is connected to the mainland via several bridges. Together with the small islands of Riddarholmen and Helgeandsholmen it forms Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm. The name Gamla stan can also refer to the island itself, as the name Stadsholmen is rarely used in daily speech.

Stadsholmen is the location of Stockholm Palace, the official residence and working palace of the Swedish monarch, and used for ceremonial receptions. The offices of the King, the other members of the Swedish Royal Family, and the offices of the Royal Court of Sweden are located here.

<text>Drottningholm Palace (), or [[Drottningholm]], one of Sweden&#x27;s royal palaces, situated near Sweden&#x27;s capital Stockholm, is the private residence of the Swedish royal family. 

Located on Lovön island in Stockholm County&#x27;s Ekerö Municipality, it was built in the late 17th century and was a regular summer residence of the Swedish royal court through most of the 18th century. 

Drottningholm Palace is a popular tourist attraction.

==History==
===Origin===
The name &quot;Drottningholm&quot; (literally meaning &quot;Queen&#x27;s islet&quot;) came from the original renaissance building designed by Willem Boy, a stone palace built by John III of Sweden in 1580 for his queen, Catherine Jagiellon. This palace was preceded by a royal mansion called &quot;Torvesund&quot;.

The Queen Dowager Regent Hedwig Eleonora bought the castle throughout 1661, a year after her role as queen of Sweden ended, but it burnt to the ground on 30 December that same year. Hedwig Eleonora engaged the architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder to design and rebuild the castle. In 1662, work began on the reconstruction of the building. With the castle almost complete, Tessin died in 1681. His son Nicodemus Tessin the Younger continued his work and completed the elaborate interior designs. The Flemish sculptor Nicolaes Millich made for the great staircase and hall sculptures of the nine muses in marble, along with a series of busts of Gothic kings. In addition, he also made bust portraits of King Charles X Gustav, his wife Hedwig Eleonor and both their sons, the young King Charles XI, probably also of Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie and his wife Maria Euphrosyne, a sister of King Charles X Gustav. Millich and his assistant Burchard Precht also made decorative wood carvings in the Queen Dowager&#x27;s bed chamber.

During the period of the reconstruction, Hedwig Eleonora was head of the regency for the still-underage king, Charles XI of Sweden, from 1660 to 1672. Sweden had grown to be a powerful country after the Peace of Westphalia. The position of the Queen, essentially the ruler of Sweden, demanded an impressive residence located conveniently close to Stockholm.

During the reign of the kings Charles XI of Sweden and Charles XII of Sweden, the royal court was often present at the palace, which was used for hunting. Hedwig Eleonora used the palace as a summer residence until her death in 1715, also when she had become the undisputed host of the royal court during the absence of Charles XII in the Great Northern War (1700–1721).

===18th century===
Drottningholm continued to serve regularly as a summer residence for the royal court during the entire 18th-century. After the death of Hedwig Eleonora in 1715, Queen Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden and King Frederick I of Sweden held court at the palace in the summer.

In 1744, the palace was given as a gift from King Frederick I to the then Crown Princess, later queen of Sweden, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia when she married Adolf Frederick of Sweden, who became king of Sweden in 1751. During Louisa Ulrika&#x27;s ownership of Drottningholm the interior of the palace was transformed into a more sophisticated French rococo style. Louisa Ulrika was also responsible for having the Drottningholm Palace Theatre rebuilt in a grand style after the more modest original building burnt down in 1762. Louisa Ulrika and Adolf Fredrick continued to reside at the palace during their reign (1751–1771). In 1777, Louisa Ulrika sold Drottningholm to the Swedish state.

While it was owned by the Swedish state, the palace was used by King Gustav III of Sweden, son of Louisa Ulrika, as a summer residence, and a grand ceremonial court life was performed at the palace, which is considered to have been a great age for the palace, during which it was known for the elaborate masquerades and grand theatrical festivities and tournaments performed in the gardens. During the reign of Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden (reign 1792–1809) and Charles XIII of Sweden (reign 1809–1818) the palace was gradually used more sporadically. In 1797, it was the place of the great festivities when the King&#x27;s bride, Frederica of Baden, was received there upon her arrival in Sweden, during which the last so called carousel, or tournament, was staged in the palace garden. After the Coup of 1809, the deposed Gustav IV Adolf was kept here under guard in the Chinese Drawing Room for eleven days.

===19th century===
During the reign of Charles XIV John of Sweden (reign 1818–1844), the palace was abandoned. The King regarded it as a symbol of the old dynasty, and Drottningholm was left to decay. The buildings were damaged by the forces of nature, and their inventories were either taken away or auctioned off.

It was apparently opened to the public for the first time during this period: a tour was mentioned in 1819, and the public used the park for picnics.
Occasionally, the grounds were used for public events: in 1823, the bride of the crown prince, Josephine of Leuchtenberg, was received upon her arrival to Sweden, and her name day continued to be celebrated here. Foreign guests were received in the palace gardens, such as Tsar Nicholas I of Russia.

Oscar I of Sweden took an interest in the palace, and though he preferred Tullgarn Palace as summer residence, he took care to preserve the palace by doing the first repairs in 1846. He further more used it for public celebrations, such as a reception for Pan-Scandinavian students in 1856, and in 1858, the future Gustav V of Sweden was born in the palace. Charles XV of Sweden preferred Ulriksdal Palace as his summer residence and ignored Drottningholm, but Oscar II of Sweden continued the repairs.

Both Oscar I and Oscar II were criticized for modernizing the palace and adjusting it to contemporary fashion rather than restoring it to its original state, and it was not until the reign of Gustav V that the palace and surroundings were reconstructed to their 18th-century appearance. In 1907, a major four-year restoration of the palace was begun to restore it to its former state, after which the royal court began to use it regularly again.

===Royal residence===
Since 1981 King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden have resided in the southern wing of the palace. The other parts of the palace are open to the public. Also during this time there has been, just like at Stockholm Palace, a unit of royal guards stationed at the palace. During the covid-19 pandemic the King and Queen carried out some of their work from their home in the palace. Otherwise their official workplace has remained at Stockholm Palace.

For the Queens 50th Birthday in 1993 she was gifted a swimming pavilion worth 9 million SEK by the Wallenberg family that was attached to the south wings courtyard. To get permission to construct the pavilion it was constructed in a way that would allow its demolition without harming the original palace. In 2018 the pavilion was renovated for a cost of 744 000 SEK, taken from taxpayer money since it is now counted as a part of a state owned building and as such it is the job of the state to maintain it.

==The palace==
The palace and its grounds have seen many renovations, changes and additions over the past 400 years. The largest renovation, in which electricity, heating, sewage, water lines were either installed or updated and the castle roof replaced, took place between 1907 and 1913.
During a 20-year-period beginning around 1977, several major areas of the palace were restored and rebuilt. The library and national hall received much of the attention and fire protection was installed throughout the palace. In 1997, work began to clean and rebuild the exterior walls. This was completed in 2002.

===The palace church===
The church was designed and erected by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder. It was completed by his son in May, 1746.

It is still used by the people of Lovön parish, who worship in the church on the last Sunday of every month. Inside the castle church a Cahman organ from 1730 is still in use. Another noteworthy item is the traditional church tapestry which was made by Gustav V of Sweden.

===The palace theatre===


The Drottningholm Palace Theatre is the opera house located at the palace. It is still in use, and its summer opera festivals are quite popular. At times the Royal Swedish Opera company guest performs.

===The Chinese Pavilion===
The Chinese Pavilion, located on the grounds of the Drottningholm Palace park, is a Chinese-inspired royal pavilion built in 1763–1770.

==The gardens==
The gardens and park areas surrounding the castle and its buildings are one of the main attractions for the tourists that visit the palace each year. The gardens have been established in stages since the castle was built, resulting in different styles of parks and gardens.

===The Baroque garden===
The oldest part of the gardens was created at the end of the 17th century under the direction of Hedwig Eleonora. The father and son Tessin led the project that created a Baroque garden right outside the main palace, flanked by thick tree avenues. The many statues scattered throughout this area were created by the artist Adrian de Vries; the Swedish army took them as spoils of war from the Wallenstein Palace in Prague, while the two marble lions at the main gate of the palace were transported from the Ujazdów Castle in Warsaw. The Baroque garden was neglected along with the rest of the grounds during the 19th century, but was restored in the 1950s and 1960s on the initiative of Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden.

===The English garden===
Gustav III of Sweden took the initiative for the English landscape garden of Drottningholm. This lies north of the Baroque garden and consists of two ponds with canals, bridges, large open lawns, and trees in groups or avenues. Walkways are laid out throughout this large part of the park.

Throughout this area &quot;vistas&quot; can be seen, cleared lines of sight that are intentionally constructed to draw the eye to a particular view. Most of the antique marble statues throughout the gardens were purchased by Gustav III from Italy. The purpose of the statues is to surprise a visitor by their unexpected appearance in a green area, or as a focal point for a vista.

==UNESCO World Heritage Site==
The palace is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, mainly because of the Drottningholm Palace Theatre and the Chinese Pavilion. It was added to the list in 1991. The UNESCO comments were:

<doc id="322969" wikidata="Q6413808" url="?curid=322969" title="Kingwood, Houston">
<text>Kingwood is a master-planned community located in northeast Houston, Texas, United States. The majority of the community is located in Harris County with a small portion in Montgomery County. Known as the &quot;Livable Forest,&quot; it is the largest master-planned community in Harris County and second-largest within the 10-county metropolitan area. It was classified as a &quot;census-designated place&quot; during the 1990 census, when the population recorded was 37,397. It is on the east fork of the San Jacinto River.

Kingwood was created in 1971 as a joint venture between the Friendswood Development Company and King Ranch. Its name was derived as part of that partnership.

==History==
The Foster Lumber Company originally owned a portion of the tract of land that was later developed into the community of Kingwood. The Foster Family had owned the land since around 1892.
On December 28, 1967, the land was sold to the joint venture between King Ranch and the Friendswood Development Company, an Exxon subsidiary. Exxon&#x27;s Friendswood Development Company hired John Bruton Jr. to serve as the Operations Manager in which he was responsible for the planning, development, engineering, and construction of Kingwood Plans for the community included greenbelts, shopping centers, schools, churches, recreational facilities, riding and hiking trails, and a boat ramp with access to Lake Houston.

The City of Houston annexed portions of what would become Kingwood in the 1960s, but it dis-annexed those portions by the late 1970s, making them unincorporated.

Kingwood was founded in 1970, and the first village opened in 1971. Since the opening, the community had the slogan &quot;The Livable Forest.&quot; In 1976 Kingwood had a few thousand residents. Between 1980 and 1990 the community&#x27;s population increased between 40 percent and 70 percent. In 1990 the community had 19,443 residents and 204 businesses. The population increased to 37,397 in 1992. In 2005 the population was roughly 65,000, and had almost 200,000 people living within a ten-mile (16 km) radius.

In 1994, the City of Houston began the process to annex Kingwood. According to Texas state law at the time, a home-rule city was allowed to annex an unincorporated area, without the consent of the residents, if the area is within the city&#x27;s extraterritorial jurisdiction. Bob Lanier, then the Mayor of Houston, believed that the annexation of Kingwood would result in a $4 million annual gain for the City of Houston. Lanier argued that the city needed to bring in Kingwood to add more to its tax base. On Wednesday August 21, 1996, the Houston City Council asked the Planning and Development Department to create service plans for Kingwood and Jacintoport, another area being annexed by Houston. The annexation of Kingwood and Jacintoport increased the city&#x27;s population by about 43,000 people. The annexation meant that areas de-annexed by the city in the 1970s were being re-annexed.

Renée C. Lee of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said that Kingwood residents &quot;fought an uphill battle [against annexation] for two years.&quot; Kingwood residents offered to pay $4 million to the city in exchange for not being annexed. The residents also filed a federal lawsuit against the City of Houston, claiming that the city was taxing residents without representation. At the time, many residents believed that the City of Houston would not follow through on the state law requirement asking annexing cities to provide equal services to the annexed areas as they do to their original territory. Some residents did not like the idea of the city annexing their community without the community&#x27;s consent.

In 1996 Thomas Phillips, a retired longshoreman and Bordersville resident, joined with representatives of Kingwood and sued the City of Houston in federal court arguing that the city could not legally annex areas if it did not provide certain services to some of its existing areas, including Bordersville which never had city water. Imad F. Abdullah, the President of Landmark Architects Inc., criticized the residents who fought annexation in his 1996 editorial in the &quot;Houston Business Journal&quot;, arguing that a &quot;not in my backyard&quot; mentality in particular communities overall negatively affects the entire metropolitan area. Houston annexed Kingwood at 11:59 PM on December 31, 1996, adding about to the city limits.

Kingwood residents lobbied the Texas Legislature, asking for modifications to the state&#x27;s annexation laws. In 1999 the legislature successfully passed amendments requiring annexing municipalities to develop plans for services provided to communities being annexed, and municipalities are required to provide a three-year planning period prior to official annexation to allow for public comment. The modified law allows for communities to use arbitration if the annexing cities fail to follow through with their service plans. The amendments do not affect prior annexations, including Kingwood&#x27;s annexation. Some Kingwood residents expressed satisfaction that other suburban unincorporated areas including The Woodlands would not undergo the annexation that occurred in Kingwood.

A 1999 series of robberies were perpetrated by four teenage girls from Kingwood. The film &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot; was loosely based on the incidents.

In 2006, Kingwood had over 65,000 residents. During that year, ten years after the annexation, Lee said that &quot;[a]nger and resentment that colored the early days of annexation&quot; never dissipated and that most Kingwood residents &quot;have settled in as Houstonians, but who still opposed annexation.&quot; Lee said that while residents sometimes complain about high rates for sewer and water services and obvious inadequacies in the fire and EMS services, those residents believe that Kingwood &quot;has greatly suffered from being a part of the city.&quot; Lee says that most residents &quot;will never come to terms with Houston&#x27;s hostile takeover.&quot; Lee said that &quot;Services have deteriorated, and the community has lost its identity as a suburban haven as most people had feared&quot; and &quot;Many residents believe the community has not maintained its identity as the &quot;Livable Forest&quot;[.]&quot;

In 2017, Kingwood suffered evacuations and severe flooding from the after-effects of Hurricane Harvey. The flooding was aggravated by the San Jacinto River Authority&#x27;s decision to open floodgates.

==Cityscape==

Kingwood has over of space. The community, newly suburban and heavily forested, includes over in nature preserves and parks. Renée C. Lee of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; compared the presence of forests, parks, and trails in Kingwood to the presence of those features in The Woodlands.

Kingwood is thirty miles northeast of Downtown Houston in the piney woods of southeastern Texas. It is divided into neighborhoods called &quot;villages&quot;. Most villages have a neighborhood pool and playground providing free access for village residents, an elementary school, and most provide their own set of village-specific services. During the summer, many of the villages organize youth swimming teams affiliated with the Northwest Aquatic League (NWAL).

Trailwood is Kingwood&#x27;s oldest village, with its first homes being completed in 1971. While Kingwood is almost built out, there are some new homes still being built in Royal Shores and Woodridge Forest.

The villages of Kingwood include Barrington, Bear Branch, Deer Ridge Estates, Elm Grove, Fosters Mill, Greentree, Hunters Ridge, Kings Crossing, Kings Crossing Patio Homes, Kings Crossing XIV, Kings Forest, Kings Forest Estates, Kings Point, Kings River, Kingwood Glen, Kingwood Greens, Kingwood Lakes, Kingwood Place, Mills Branch, North Woodland Hills, Reserve at Kings Point, River Bend, Riverchase, Royal Shores, Sand Creek, Sherwood Trails, South Woodland Hills, Trailwood, Woodridge Forest, Woodspring Forest, and Woodstream. Nearby developments include Forest Cove, Kings Lake Estates, Lakewood Cove, North Kingwood Forest, Oakhurst at Kingwood, King&#x27;s Mill, and King&#x27;s Manor. Oakhurst does not pay Kingwood Service Association fees, though it is considered part of Kingwood and is also developed by Friendswood Development.

Kingwood is home to ClubCorp&#x27;s Kingwood Country Club. It is the largest private club in Houston and one of the biggest in the world, with over 3,300 members. The golf courses and clubhouses were used in the filming of the 1996 movie, &quot;Tin Cup&quot; starring Kevin Costner.

==Media==
The citywide newspaper is the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;.

Kingwood has two community newspapers, &quot;The Tribune Newspaper&quot; and &quot;The Kingwood Observer&quot;.

==Crime rate==
In January through August 2003, the crime rate in Kingwood was 1,793 per 100,000 residents. Less than 10% of crimes were violent. During January through August 2006, the crime rate was 1,364 per 100,000 residents. In this case, less than 10% of the crimes were violent.

In 1999 Sergeant G.A. MacAnulty of the Houston Police Department, who worked at the Kingwood substation, stated that almost all of the crime is perpetrated by juveniles. Vandalism had often occurred in the community. An unpublished study commissioned by the Friendswood Development Corporation and the Clergy Association of Kingwood concluded that the root of crime is due to the lack of recreational activities available in Kingwood. Dewan wrote that according to many youth there was a significant amount of recreational drug consumption in Kingwood.

==Economy==
The human resources company Insperity (formerly Administaff) has its headquarters in Kingwood.

==Education==
As of 1999, about 90% of children raised in Kingwood attended colleges and universities.

===Primary and secondary schools===

====Public schools====

Kingwood pupils residing in Harris County attend the Humble Independent School District. Kingwood High School (6A) and Kingwood Park High School (5A) serve the area. All students enrolled in Humble Independent School District also have the option to attend Quest High School, a magnet high school in Atascocita.

The 1996 annexation of Kingwood did not change school district boundaries nor did it change any attendance zones of individual public schools.

Students residing in Montgomery County attend the New Caney Independent School District. Residents of that portion attend Porter High School (5A). Before the opening of Porter High School in 2010, students attended New Caney High School. A small portion of North Woodland Hills, as well as the Kings Manor, Kings Mill, Woodridge Forest, and Oakhurst at Kingwood developments, are located in Montgomery County.

Kingwood is served by three Humble ISD middle schools: Kingwood Middle School, Creekwood Middle School and Riverwood Middle School. Kingwood Middle School students are zoned to Kingwood Park High School, while students attending Creekwood and Riverwood are zoned to Kingwood High School.

===Public libraries===
Dedicated on August 12, 1983, the original Kingwood Branch of the Harris County Public Library, had over 112,000 books. In partnership with the Houston Public Library, plans were made to replace the original branch with a new a &quot;City-County&quot; branch in exchange for 4.2 million dollars to fund the building of a new facility. The original Kingwood Library location closed on March 13, 2010, and the new location opened on April 19, 2010. The demolished building was replaced by a new community center.

In addition to the Kingwood Library, and within Kingwood, there is also the Kingwood Community College library, which permits access for &quot;currently enrolled students, high school students and adults living within the district, patrons of Montgomery County Memorial Library System, and college employees.&quot;

==Government and infrastructure==

===Local government===
The City of Houston provides police, fire and ambulance services. The Houston Public Works Department is responsible for the maintenance and construction of roads in Kingwood. The City of Houston maintains water services. Before the annexation, 13 municipal utility districts (MUD) provided those services. After annexation, water and sewer bills increased; most residents had their water bills be double and triple the billed amounts prior to annexation. In 2006 Mayor of Houston Bill White said that the city had to cover the debts of the MUDs, so it increased the water and sewer rates.

Houston City Council District E serves Kingwood. Dave Martin currently represents the district. District E contains Kingwood and the Houston portion of Clear Lake City. The City of Houston has a liaison who works with the District E representative and the residents of Kingwood. In 2006 some Kingwood residents told the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; that the District E representative has too little influence in city council, which had 15 seats during that year, and that the district is, in the words of Renée C. Lee of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, territorially &quot;spread too thin.&quot;

METRO operates a single Park and Ride location in Kingwood to provide commuters with an alternative to driving themselves downtown.

The Kingwood Chamber of Commerce serves local businesses and the community with regular activities such as Kleenwood.

Around the time of annexation, much of the controversy regarding the annexation centered on the fire and police services. Residents believed that they received a higher quality of police and fire services than the City of Houston offered. When Kingwood became a part of Houston, residents could no longer legally discharge fireworks in Kingwood due to a City of Houston ban. Ordinarily the city government would, post-annexation, allow volunteer fire departments to continue operating under a contract. Due to an inability reach an agreement with the Kingwood Volunteer Fire Department, the city as of 1996 planned to immediately establish fire services after annexation.

The Kingwood community associations control the deed restrictions of the neighborhoods.

===Police===
The Houston Police Department&#x27;s Kingwood Patrol Division, headquartered at 3915 Rustic Woods Drive, provides law enforcement services to Kingwood. As of 2006 the police station has a captain and 74 patrol and supervisor police officers. Bill White, Mayor of Houston in 2006, said that Kingwood had fair police services. Of the communities of Houston, Kingwood has the lowest number of police officers in relation to the overall number of crimes committed in the city. White also said that he received requests to remove police officers from Kingwood and place them in areas of Houston with higher crime rates. White said that he refused the requests since the removal would impact response times in Kingwood, the worst in the city.

Minors under the age of 17 are subject to a Houston mandated curfew after 11:00PM Sunday through Thursday, or 12:00AM on Friday and Saturday (baring few minor exceptions.) This curfew extends to fill the time between 9AM until 2:30PM on days when school is in session. John Cannon, a spokesman for the HPD says, &quot;the curfew is to ensure that kids are in school getting an education.&quot;

Prior to annexation, the Harris County Precinct 4 Constable provided law enforcement services. Initially after annexation, the Kingwood Storefront of the Northeast Patrol Division served Kingwood.

===Fire===
Kingwood&#x27;s fire stations are within Houston Fire District 102, operated by the Houston Fire Department. There are four stations located within Kingwood: Station 101, Station 102, Station 103 and Station 104. A fifth station, Station 105, is outside of Kingwood and in the same fire district. As of 2006, the Kingwood fire stations include one district chief, 30 firefighters, three medic units, and nine pieces of equipment.

When the City of Houston annexed Kingwood in 1996, the city acquired four stations held by the Kingwood Volunteer Fire Department (VFD). The stations acquired were numbered by the city from 101 to 104. Before the annexation, the department had up to 80 paid and volunteer firefighters and twelve pieces of equipment. After annexation the city added one more fire station. Mike Byers, a Kingwood resident quoted in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; and the president of the Humble Area Chamber of Commerce, said that because many of the volunteer fire department members were friends and neighbors of Kingwood residents, the Kingwood residents had difficulty with the loss of the VFD and the city taking the money. He added that many of the new staff of the emergency services stations were not familiar with Kingwood, and some were unable to find certain locations, leading to slow response times and 11 deaths. As of 2006 Byers says that the City of Houston now provides fair emergency services to Kingwood residents.

Bill White, Mayor of Houston in 2006, said during that year that Kingwood had &quot;a great fire and EMS service with one of our best captains in the Kingwood area, and I have not gotten any complaints about fire and EMS response times, which is one of the best in the nation.&quot; In 2006 Mike Fuhre, the former chief of the Kingwood VFD, criticized HFD for allocating fewer staff and pieces of equipment to Kingwood than had existed during the existence of the VFD. Fuhre said that there were occasions when Kingwood had no coverage because all of the firefighters were called to other locations, and still do.

===County, state, and federal representation===
Kingwood residents vote mostly Republican, and representatives of Kingwood on local and state levels tend to be Republican. The Harris County portion of Kingwood lies in Harris County Precinct 4 (PCT4). As of 2021 PCT4&#x27;s commissioner is Jack Cagle and the constable is Mark Herman.

The Harris County section of Kingwood is located in District 127 of the Texas House of Representatives. As of 2021, Dan Huberty represents the district. The Montgomery County section of Kingwood is located in District 16 of the Texas House of Representatives. As of 2021, Will Metcalf represents the district. Kingwood is within District 4 of the Texas Senate; as of 2021 Brandon Creighton represents that district.

Kingwood is in Texas&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. As of 2021, Dan Crenshaw represents the district.

The United States Postal Service Kingwood Post Office is located at 4025 Feather Lakes Way. After the 1996 annexation of Kingwood, residents retained &quot;Kingwood, Texas&quot; mailing addresses, and some places in the Houston city limits before the annexation had Kingwood mailing addresses.

===Healthcare===
Harris Health System (formerly Harris County Hospital District), the hospital district for Harris County, operates E. A. &quot;Squatty&quot; Lyons Health Center in Humble. The nearest public hospital is Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital in northeast Houston.

<text>The ragfish (&quot;Icosteus aenigmaticus&quot;) is a ray-finned fish of the northern Pacific Ocean; although classified as a bony fish, its skeleton is mostly cartilage, and the larvae have pelvic fins that disappear as they mature. It is the sole member of the family Icosteidae within the order Scombriformes.

The ragfish body is scaleless and limp, because of its cartilaginous skeleton and its flabby muscles. None of the fins have any spines. The dorsal and anal fins extend much of the length of the body, while the pelvic fins are absent. The coloration is generally a dark brown, and maximum known length is 2 m.

Ragfishes are found on the bottom from near the surface in the case of juveniles to , occasionally down to , for the adults. They are said to eat jellyfishes, other fish, squid, and octopus, although recent catches show no squid beaks but large numbers of jellyfish. Ragfish are rarely seen and little is known about them.

The larvae make a remarkable transformation as they mature; the dorsal fin and anal fin both shrink, and the pelvic fins disappear.

Formerly, adult ragfishes were considered to be a different species, known then as &quot;Acrotus willoughbyi&quot;.

<text>A student society, student association, university society, student club, university club, or student organization is a society or an organization, operated by students at a university, college, or other educational institution, whose membership typically consists only of students and/or alumni.

Early notable types of student societies include the medieval so-called nations of the University of Bologna and the University of Paris. Later Modern era examples include the Studentenverbindung in the German speaking world, as well as the evolvement of fraternal orders for students and Greek-letter student fraternities and sororities internationally.

Aims may involve practice and propagation of a certain professional hobby or to promote professional development or philanthropic causes. Examples of common societies found in most universities are a debate society, an international student society, a rock society, and student chapters of professional societies (e.g. the American Chemical Society). Not all societies are based around such a large area of interest and many universities also find themselves home to societies for many obscure hobbies such as a Neighbours society.

Student societies often have open membership, although some are invitation only including honor societies, secret societies, and certain traditional fraternities. Students typically join societies at the beginning of the school year when many societies present themselves in a societies fair and campaign to attract new members. The students may pay a membership fee to the society, while some may not. Since the societies are non-profit organizations this fee is often nominal and purely exists to cover insurance or to fund society events.

Student societies may or may not be affiliated with a university&#x27;s students&#x27; union. Student societies often aim to facilitate a particular activity or promote a belief system, although some explicitly require nothing more than that a member is a present or former student. Additionally, some are not affiliated with a specific university or accept non-university students. Moreover, most student run organizations tend to depend heavily on collaborations with externals for their credibility and their success.

==Examples==
Typical examples are:
* Civil Societies - encourage polite behaviour among people.
* Debating societies - organise and promote debates and/or oratory.
* Ethnic, national origin, or cultural organizations 
* Faculty societies or Academic discipline societies - unite students from one university faculty, constituent college, or interrelated academic disciplines. 
* Film societies - display and discuss films.
* Hiking clubs - organise hiking trips.
* International student societies - introduce international students to one another and promote international cooperation.
* Martial arts societies, such as Taekwondo and Karate
* Music societies
* Regional societies - unite students from the same region or hometown; a student nation.
* Religious Organizations and Communities 
* Science fiction societies
* Student wing - a subsidiary, autonomous, or independently allied front of a larger organization that is formed in order to rally support from students and focus on student specific issues.
* Political organizations and Political parties
* Labour and Trade unions
* Advocacy groups
* Social clubs
* Professional association
* Greek-letter student fraternities and sororities
* Service organizations

==Student societies by location==

===Armenia===
The Armenian National Students Association and the National Youth Council of Armenia are the two most prominent student societies in Armenia.

===Australia===
In Australia, student societies play an important role in university life by bringing together like-minded students to engage in activities the society seeks to promote.

===Belgium===

====Flanders====
In Flanders, student societies play a unique role in student life. Student societies there have traditionally been politically active, and they played a significant part in the 1960s division of the Catholic University of Leuven into separate Flemish and Walloon universities.

A student society in Flanders is led by a &quot;praesidium&quot;. The head of the praesidium (and the society) is the &quot;praeses&quot;. Alternative spellings are &quot;presidium&quot; and &quot;preses&quot;. For most positions, Dutch names are used nowadays.

Other positions include:
* &quot;vice-praeses&quot;: assists the praeses where needed.
* &quot;Quaestor&quot;: takes care of the money.
* &quot;&quot;: the secretary of the student organisation.
* &quot;Cantor&quot;: Leads the cantus. 
* &quot;Vertor&quot;: Organises cultural activities.
* &quot;Scriptor&quot;: Is responsible for creating a Magazine.
* &quot;Bacchus&quot;: Is responsible for alcoholic beverages. (Title taken from the Roman name for Dionysus)
* &quot;Dominus morum&quot;: Is responsible for keeping order at a cantus.
Positions are flexible, and change to meet the needs of the student organisation.

Student societies used to be politically engaged, but are now more focused on organizing parties, cantus, and cultural activities.

Student societies also exist at polytechnics.
New members go through an initiation ritual before becoming full members of a Flemish student society. A new member is called &quot;schacht&quot; and has to undergo a &quot;baptism&quot;. The baptism is the first step to integration in the student society. The next (and last) step to becoming a full-fledged member is the &quot;ontgroening&quot;. After the &quot;ontgroening&quot;, one becomes a normal member or &quot;commilito&quot; of the organization, and can join the praesidium if one so chooses. Normal members are also referred to as &quot;anciens&quot;.

====Francophone Belgians====
In Wallonia and Brussels, several types of francophone student societies exist:
* A &quot;cercle&quot; regroup students from the same faculty
* A &quot;regionale&quot; regroup students coming from the same location
* An &quot;ordre&quot; regroup students around some aspects of the student folklore or traditions. The most famous is arguably ANLO.
* A &quot;kot-à-projet&quot; (KAP) regroups students sharing the same passion for diversified projects : sports, arts, culture, sustainability or social issues...

These societies sometimes have traditions dating back a hundred years, such as wearing one of the two traditional student hats: the Penne or the Calotte. Their main activity is organising and attending parties or festivals (for example, the 24 hours bike ride of Louvain-la-Neuve or the St V).

===Canada===
The Alma Mater Society at Queen&#x27;s University is the oldest such organization in Canada, and currently the most extensive in regard to student involvement. It is currently a multi-million corporation employing over 500 students. The day-to-day operations of the AMS are overseen by the AMS Council which includes an annually elected three-person executive (the President, Vice-President (Operations) and Vice-President (University Affairs), selected as a slate), five commissioners who are each responsible for a specific aspect of student life, and three directors who are responsible for overseeing the AMS’ 14 corporate services.

===Denmark===
Student organizations in Denmark are often interchangeable with the students&#x27; unions, as the local organizations at the universities are concerned about matters related to political interest and social activities. The political interests of the students are nationally represented by The National Union of Students in Denmark, which mandate is democratically given by the local organizations.

===Estonia===

Estonian Students&#x27; Society (Estonian: Eesti Üliõpilaste Selts commonly used acronym: EÜS) is the largest and oldest all-male academical student society in Estonia, which is similar to Baltic German student corporations (should not be confused with American college fraternities). It was founded in 1870 at the University of Tartu. It has over 900 members in Estonia and abroad.

In Estonia are 10 academical male student corporations. They are joined in League of Estonian Corporations, which was founded on March 28, 1915 by Vironia, Fraternitas Estica, Sakala, Ugala and Rotalia. Estonian student corporations have hundreds of members and alumni worldwide, because after the Soviet annexation of Estonia many members fled to Western countries.

Added to them there are one female student society: Estonian Women Students&#x27; Society, five female student corporations: Filiae Patriae, Indla, Lembela, Amicitia, Sororitas Estoniae.

===European-wide===
In Europe, there are several continent-wide student organisations fostering exchange among students of different nationalities and Culture, such as 
* ESU (European Students&#x27; Union), the umbrella organisation of 44 national unions of students from 38 countries, representing over 15 million students
* AEGEE (European Students Forum), trying to spread the European idea
*BEST (Board of European Students of Technology)
*Bonding
* EESTEC (Electrical Engineering Students&#x27; European Association)
* EFPSA (European Federation of Psychology Students&#x27; Associations)
* ELSA (European Law Students&#x27; Association)
* EMSA (European Medical Students&#x27; Association)
* ESN (Erasmus Student Network), promoting student mobility in Europe and beyond
* ESTIEM (European Students of Industrial Engineering &amp; Management)
* EUROAVIA (European Association of Aerospace Students)
*EUGEN (European Geology Students Network)
*OBESSU (Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions)
*JEF (Young European Federalists), a pan-European network promoting the idea of European integration

There is also the National Unions of Students in Europe, a representative student organisation at European level, notably within the Bologna process.

=== Finland ===

In Finland, there are many various student societies, ranging in variety based of education and ethnicity. By law all Finnish universities must have a statutory students&#x27; union and membership in these unions are often required for undergraduate students. The most well-known of these is the National Union of University Students in Finland, who aims at improving student conditions, with them representing around 135,000 students. All Universities of Applied Sciences must have a statutory student council and union, however membership in these are not mandatory. All student unions in the University of Applied Sciences are under the Umbrella Organization; .

In secondary schools, high school students can join the and both high school and vocational students can join the , which is made for Finland Swedes.

===France===
*AMGE-Caravane, (French: &quot;Association des Marocains aux Grandes Ecoles et aux Universités&quot;), dedicated to Moroccan students and alumni

===Germany===
In Germany, student societies are widespread and various, though by lack of support from the universities (and by force of variety), generally do not boast many members. The most popular are the Studentenverbindungen; most of them are moderate and tolerant, although many are restricted to male or Christian members.

On many universities - although in many states not officially recognised - there are student representations, called AStA (Allgemeiner Studenten-Ausschuss), StuVe (Studentische Vertretung) or StuRa (Studentenrat).

Other organisations include European Student Associations and the student organisations of the German political parties

Yet, there are also politically and confessionally independent, interdisciplinary and not-for-profit student organisations. One of, if not the leading one in Germany is the Studentenforum im Tönissteiner Kreis e. V. (Student Forum within the Tönissteiner Kreis e. V.) that is part of a European and worldwide network of student organizations, the Politeia Community.

===Indonesia===
Student societies in Indonesia, such as Budi Oetomo, have existed since before the Indonesian National Revolution of 1945. Afterwards, other associations, such as the Islamic Students of Indonesia (PII) and Muhammadiyah Student Association (IPM) were founded.

=== Iran ===
The Student Organization of Iran is a public and non-governmental organization affiliated to the Ministry of Education of Iran, which is a supplement to public education in the form of social education and started its activities on May 10, 1999. This organization is under the control of the Board of Trustees of the Student Organization, which consists of the officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the students of this country.

===Ireland===
Student societies are widespread in Ireland&#x27;s universities, with a wide range of activities catered for, including debating, performing arts, role-play, faculty-based activities, gaming, political activity etc. The range of support for societies varies from university to university, though all universities provide funding and facilities to some extent for societies.

Student societies are usually governed by Officers and a Committee with an &quot;Auditor&quot; at its head. The Biological Society, RCSI&#x27;s main student society, is purportedly the oldest student medical society in the world. However, it is Trinity College, Dublin which is the location of College Historical Society (1770), the oldest student society in the world. The Literary and Debating Society (NUI Galway) also has the distinction for being the first known student society in the world to elect a female leader, with the election of Clare F. Fitzgerald as &quot;Auditor&quot; in 1942.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, there are different forms of student societies. Originally there was just the &quot;Corps&quot; (for corpus studiosorum), student bodies, starting with the Groninger Studenten Corps &quot;Vindicat atque Polit&quot; in the city of Groningen on 4 February 1815, as a part of the governing of the education on the universities and to give students the opportunity to develop themselves in all fields of life. On the wave of catholic emancipation starting in the 1890s, small groups of students, gathered around local priests, split off from the liberal, secular (in name anyway) corps fraternities to form their own societies focused on the catholic religion. This started the formation of many other religious societies in the different university cities. In the second half of the 20th century the Catholic split-offs formed an intercity-connection; the and the focus on the religion was lost or abandoned.

These societies are now known as &quot;student associations&quot; in the Netherlands, aimed mostly at social relations and gezelligheid. Most of the corpora now reside in older buildings in the city center, retaining mostly a rather traditional and conservative image. These organizations offer students a wide range of sports, cultural activities ranging from all levels of sports like field hockey, rowing and rugby to extremes like kitesurfing, glider-flying, all for student-friendly prices and development aid organisations and encouragement to start a new club of some sort at all times.

The 20th century also saw, especially in the 1960s, the formation of more independent societies at the universities itself, partly as a reaction against the elite status of the corps, abolishing hazing and religious links and some even opening up to non-students. These non-Corps student societies are known as &quot;study associations&quot; (aimed at extracurricular activities for students, such as study trips, lectures, parties or drinks) or are general associations, for sports, literature, arts, etc., founded at the university itself.

===Norway===
The tradition with student societies in Norway reaches back to 1813, when Norwegian Students&#x27; Society in Oslo was founded. The major student societies in Norway are those in Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen. The societies in Oslo and Trondheim operates the student houses, and do also have subgroups who are engaged in theatre, political debates, radio, TV and newspaper. Bergen Student Society are not in charge of the city&#x27;s student house, but are arranging political debates, lectures and cultural discussions at Det Akademiske Kvarter.

A Norwegian tradition is to appoint an animal as the high protector or majesty of the student societies, such as &quot;His Majesty the Golden Pig&quot; (Oslo), &quot;The Black Sheep&quot; (Trondheim) and His Majesty the Hedgehog (Bergen). The zoological Majesties have their own order of honours, awarded to members of the student societies and member of the academic staff at the institutions, as well as visiting members of the Norwegian royal family.

===Sweden===
Student leisure activities in Sweden are usually organised by the students&#x27; unions (&quot;studentkårer&quot;, &quot;studentkår&quot; in singular). Swedish student unions cover the whole area from arranging most of the big parties, cultural activities and sports event, to acting as an equivalent of trade union for the students so their voices can be heard regarding the content and forms of education. The union is usually divided in smaller parts called sections, &quot;sektioner&quot;, according to what subjects of programs the students study. Generally all kinds of smaller societies, political, religious or just dealing with different kinds of hobbies, are organised within the students&#x27; union rather than as separate units.

An exception to this are the two ancient universities in Uppsala and Lund. There, most activities except &quot;trade union&quot; issues are organised by the student nations, the oldest student societies in Sweden, now thirteen at each university. The Uppsala nations have a history stretching back to ca 1630–1640, and were likely formed under the influence of the &quot;Landsmannschaften&quot; in existence at the northern German universities frequented by Swedish students. The nations in Lund were formed at the time of the foundation of the university (1666) or shortly thereafter. The nations take the names from the Swedish provinces from which they traditionally recruited their members, but do not always adhere to the strict practice of limiting membership according to those principles.

=== Taiwan ===
Student societies exist not only in universities but are even required in highschool. The curriculum guidelines of 12-year basic education mandates that Taiwanese high school students must receive at least 24 credits of group activities（社團活動） in one academic year. Most General senior high school students participate in two hours of group activities (社課) each week. This has encouraged the formation of well-supported rock societies (熱音社) and street dance societies (熱舞社). These student societies run themselves with minimal funds, traditionally hosting activities that require large amounts of labor and dedication; in return, committee members (幹部) are rewarded with academic commendations (嘉獎) or even minor merits (小功) from the school.

=== Uzbekistan ===
As a former Soviet Union state, Uzbekistan holds some of the best Universities in Central Asia. First universities were established back in the 1920s in the Turkestan Socialist Republic. Today many of these universities have their own student societies. These societies provide information and support for students who want to study in Tashkent.

=== United Kingdom ===
The UK universities boast many notable societies, most of them organised through the universities&#x27; Student Unions. These societies encompass a wide range of topics, from course-specific societies, sport societies, film or TV show societies and business societies.

===United States===

Many student societies in the US are focused on the interests of the student members, whether it involves community service (such as the Feed The Families Club), the ethnicity of the members (such as a Black Student Union or Hillel), their religion (such as Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship) or lack of religion (such as the Secular Student Alliance), or their political interests (such as College Republicans or College Democrats). Others focus on a specific social cause (such as the Real Estate Club), whether by topic or specific to an area (even international). For example, Refresh Bolivia is a student-run nonprofit community which originated at Harvard University; it is dedicated to constructing a &quot;maternal &amp; child care oriented community health center&quot; in Cochabamba, Bolivia.

===Africa===
Student societies in Africa focus on assisting students from junior high through senior high and universities. High Schools Society in Ghana focuses on establishing a student community for students through careers, networking and community service.

<text>The plumed basilisk (Basiliscus plumifrons), also called the green basilisk, double crested basilisk, or Jesus Christ lizard, is a species of lizard in the family Corytophanidae. The species is native to Central America.

The plumed basilisk&#x27;s native range spans southern Mexico and northern Colombia. &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; inhabits hot, humid rainforests that contain streams, rivers or other water bodies.

The physical appearance of the plumed basilisk is striking: it sports a bright green color along its body with black and white streaks along its neck and back. Their physical appearance differs by sex, as they are sexually dimorphic; males have a distinct crest on the back and tail and large plumes on top of their heads, while females typically only have a singular, much smaller, crest on their head.

The green crested or plumed lizard is unique in its ability to run across water with speed and the method it employs to do this. It displays the behaviour as a threat response, when fleeing predators. High speed is maintained in order to prevent sinking.

This lizard is extraordinarily territorial and is known for its aggressive behaviour to the extent that multiple male lizards cannot be maintained within the same enclosure. However, they do exist in the wild in large groups that allow for multiple males.

==Habitat and distribution==
&quot;B. plumifrons&quot;’ habitat is restricted to rainforests that are in close proximity to running streams, such as occur in southern Mexico and northern Colombia. Moist lowlands of wet, mature forest, with running streams are their preferred environments. Their habitat is typically hot and humid.
Agroforestry systems, with the integration of forest life (trees), is necessary for the preservation of the &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; species. While the plumed basilisk is native to southern Mexico and northern Colombian rainforests, there is evidence to suggest that it occupies land across the Atlantic versant spanning eastern Honduras to western Panama. Additionally, &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; have been sighted along the Pacific coast in southwestern Costa Rica.

&quot;B. plumifrons&quot; is arboreal (preferential to tree landscape for their habitat), and diurnally active (active during the day). Of the three species of &quot;Basiliscus&quot; present in Costa Rica each is found commonly on both versants (borders of land). &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; are aquatic lizards, found in high prevalence and widespread in Central American inland rivers, streams, ponds, and lakes, in addition to beaches and seashores. This species is unique in that it is both arboreal and aquatic and can be found in large numbers in both trees and perched on boulders near bodies of water.

The temperature preference of &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; is between .

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The Green basilisk&#x27;s generic name &quot;Basiliscus&quot; is taken from the legendary reptilian creature of European mythology which could kill with a glance, by turning a person to stone with its gaze: the Basilisk. This name derives from the Greek &quot;basilískos&quot; (βασιλίσκος) meaning &quot;little king&quot;. This generic name was given in Carl Linnaeus&#x27; 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;.

For the origin of the nickname &quot;Jesus Christ lizard&quot;, see .

==Description==

The plumed basilisk is the largest basilisk species, with an average snout-to-vent length (SVL) of . Including the tail, it can reach in total length. Adults are brilliant green, with bright yellow eyes, and small bluish spots along the dorsal ridge. Males have three crests: one on the head, one on the back, and one on the tail, while females have only the head crest. Juveniles are less conspicuously colored, and lack the characteristic crests.

The green crested basilisk of &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; is a bright green lizard species found with varying streaks of white dark grey, and blue markings along its body. However, some alternative forms or subspecies of &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; have been seen to sport only black markings along its dorsal side. The underbelly of this lizard is typically a lighter shade of green than the bright green that is shown throughout its body. Its head is triangular from side view or profile, with openings for ears. These openings are slightly larger than the size of their eyes. The &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; mostly have round eyes, round pupils, and yellow irises. Small granular scales comprise the main covering for their skin. The length of the hind legs are longer than the front limbs as the hind legs are used for water running. In addition, their toes are laterally angled and flat to allow for water running. Adult males have four prominent vertebral crests: a dorsal crest, a tail crest, one atop the crown of the head, and one between their eyes. These crests form the greater physical distinction between female and male plumed basilisks. The females have only two reduced crests: a tail crest, and head crest. This characteristic is shared with the juveniles if the species.
==Predators==
The predators of &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; include birds of prey, opossums, coati, and snakes.

==Behaviour==
Male plumed basilisks are territorial; a single male may defend a territory that several females inhabit, with which he mates. Plumed basilisks do not tolerate much handling when kept in captivity.

&quot;B. plumifrons&quot; is able to run short distances across the water using both its feet and tail for support, an ability shared with other basilisks and the Malaysian sail-finned lizard, When running, they create an air cavity which they use to push themselves forward with their feet which is mostly seen in adult basilisk lizards. The adults have a greater mass than juveniles so there is less hydrodynamic lag and they are able to run across the water in order to escape their predators. This has earned the plumed basilisk the nickname &quot;Jesus Christ lizard&quot;. It is also an excellent swimmer and can stay underwater for up to an hour.

Most distinct to the &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; is the ability to run across water. Plumed basilisks will employ this behaviour in response to perceived threats experienced from surrounding predators or predatory potential. They use this strategy most commonly when they are in fear or under duress. &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; run bipedally (applying the use of both hind legs), utilizing both the foot and shank for immersion into water when their limbs are outstretched. Other lizard species utilise similar threat responses (for example, &quot;Anolis aquaticus&quot;, &quot;A. barkeri&quot;). This behaviour may be more advantageous than other responses such as water diving or swimming used by other lizard species, as it allows for escape from other aquatic predators (such as snakes, crocodiles, and large fish).

The speed at which the plumed basilisk is able to navigate water running is determined largely by each individual&#x27;s hindlimb elongation potential. The hindlimb controls the locomotor gait and the stretch of the hindlimb allows for greater surface area and thus a greater velocity. In addition, it is proposed that the surface area of the lizard&#x27;s foot is a considerable factor in gaining speed. This is a unique benefit to the &quot;B. plumifrons&quot;, as it has toes directed in a rotated orientation allowing for greater surface area of the foot to run across water. Typically the adult &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; is able to run across water at a speed of and lesser speed for juvenile &quot;B. plumifrons&quot;. While other species of lizards do employ water running behaviours, it has been shown that &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; are of the more preferential lizard species to water running and are typically less hesitant to utilize this skill.

===Running on water===
Basilisk lizards are notable for their remarkable ability to scamper across water from the time they are born. Both juvenile and adult basilisk lizards tend to use this unique trait to avoid predation. The mechanisms that allow these lizards to run across water is the result of elongated hind legs with webbing between the toes. This webbing captures pockets of air which allows the basilisk to quickly push off of water.

While some insects are able to run on water using surface tension, basilisk lizards, which have much more mass, achieve this through alternative fluid dynamics. This lizard will use its hind leg to penetrate the surface of the water beneath it to create an air-filled cavity and then retract its leg before the cavity closes. This enables the basilisk lizard to minimize its contact with water. Additionally, this running technique reduces the drag experienced during the run while simultaneously allowing the lizard&#x27;s body to be propelled across the water at an average speed of .

Although all Basilisk lizards harness this water-running ability, there is notably kinematic variation in these runs for these lizards - variation that is primarily due to differences in running velocity and not differences in the mass of the lizards running. This kinematic variation is unique to basilisk lizards. For other land lizards, kinematic variations in their running are generally similar. Studies have also indicated that the basilisks hindlimbs act as the primary force producer when they are running on water.

The basilisk lizard&#x27;s remarkable ability to run on water has allowed scientists working with bipedal and quadrupedal robots to potentially create man-made technology that could also run on water through similar mechanisms.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

During the week prior to laying, sexually mature females of &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; were observed presenting herself to the male. The female would position herself about from the male, lowering her forebody to the sand and raising her pelvic region and tail. Females lay five to fifteen eggs at a time in warm, damp sand or soil. One mother lizard in captivity actually was observed to start digging holes (sometimes referred to as nests) in the soil six months prior to ovipositing, well ahead of the breeding season. The eggs hatch after eight to ten weeks, at which point they emerge as fully independent lizards, although averaging only SVL (Snout-to-Vent Length) and weighing only about . The juvenile males would start to develop the large crests which are characteristic of the male &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; after six month or up to more than one year, depending on the body conditions of the juveniles.

Female &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; start &quot;showing&quot; (become visibly plump) one to two weeks post-fertilization. During the third week of gestation, females will begin to search for a site to burrow or lay approximately 14–17 eggs. Typically, the size and quantity of eggs will vary depending on the lifestyle and physical characteristics of the mother (i.e. age, health, and size). It is common for plumed basilisk females to lay multiple clutches within a given season and this event will occur up to four or five times during a given breeding season. Hatching of eggs occurs over a one to two day period after a gestation and incubation period of eight to ten weeks.

===Diet===
&quot;B. plumifrons&quot; are an omnivorous species, their diet is inclusive of both meat and vegetation. While meat may be a stretch from their typical consumption, they choose to eat a large variety of insects and worms. While they are capable of consuming vegetation (such as fruits, seeds, flowers, and leaves), it is less sought out in the wild as opposed to captivity for the &quot;B. plumifrons&quot;. While they do hunt smaller sized animals such as fish, small mammals (such as rodents), small birds, small nonvenomous snakes, smaller species of lizards, amphibians, and invertebrates (crustaceans, such as freshwater shrimp and crayfish, and spiders), they are most often found in search of insects for their diet.

They typically consume brown crickets, black crickets, and locusts. In captivity, some owners choose to feed their &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; or green crested lizard wax worms, calciworms, cockroaches, mealworms, and beetle worms on occasion. This latter selection of worms, roaches, and beetles are not the best suitable for the &quot;B. plumifrons&quot; diet as they are found to be high in fat and can be difficult to digest for juvenile &quot;B. plumifrons&quot;.

<text>Jinan University (/dʒiː&#x27;nan/; JNU, ) is a public university in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. It is affiliated with the United Front Work Department. The university is part of the Double First-Class Construction and Project 211.

Jinan University is currently being jointly constructed by the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party, the Ministry of Education of China, and the Guangdong Provincial Government as a &quot;Double First-Class&quot; university. It is also a key construction university under the &quot;Project 211&quot; and one of the 13 Guangdong Province High-Level Universities. Its admission scores have consistently ranked among the top three universities in Guangdong Province. Jinan University holds a unique position in the history of overseas Chinese and Chinese language education and is the first Chinese university to recruit foreign students. It is renowned as the &quot;highest institution of overseas Chinese.&quot; The university features a distinctive educational approach focusing on &quot;overseas, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.&quot; Jinan University consistently ranks among the top mainland Chinese universities in terms of the number of students from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and abroad. Jinan University is one of the earliest universities in China to offer business education and is the fifth university in mainland China to be accredited by the Association of MBAs (AMBA).

&quot;Jinan&quot; literally means &quot;reaching southward,&quot; indicating the university&#x27;s original mission to disseminate Chinese learning and culture from North to South when it was founded in 1906 in Nanjing. It is the first Chinese university to recruit foreign students and one of the universities with the largest number of international students in China.

== History ==
In 1906, Duanfang, the Viceroy of Liangjiang, submitted a memorandum to the Guangxu Emperor, proposing that an overseas Chinese school be set up for the purpose of spreading far and wide the enlightening influence of education and strengthening the emotional ties with compatriots overseas. The Guangxu Emperor approved of his proposal and thus Duanfang was honored as the founder of Jinan University. On March 23, 1907, Jinan Academy was founded in Nanjing, becoming the first of its kind in Chinese history and serving as a curtain-raiser for the later development of overseas Chinese education.

In 1927, Jinan Academy was renamed National Jinan University, located in Shanghai. After the foundation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Jinan University was closed and its schools were merged with those of other university such as Fudan University. In 1958, Jinan University was reestablished in Guangzhou.

===University name===
The name &quot;Jinan&quot; (, &quot;reaching southward&quot;) comes from the &quot;Classic of History&quot;, a compilation of documentary records related to events in ancient Chinese history. The articles reads, &quot;His speech and teachings spread from South, from China to the rest of the world.

<text>The Molson Brewery is a Canada-based brewery based in Montreal and was established in 1786 by the Molson family. In 2005, Molson merged with the Adolph Coors Company to become Molson Coors. 

Molson Coors maintains some of its Canadian operations at the site of Molson&#x27;s first brewery located on the Saint Lawrence River in Montreal.

==History==
Founded in 1786, the Molson Brewery is one of the oldest breweries in North America and continues to produce beer on the original brewery site.

On May 2, 1782, John Molson, age 18, left England for Canada, landing in Montreal on June 26. Shortly after his arrival, he began working at the Thomas Loyd brewery. In 1784, Molson sued Thomas Loyd for repayment of a debt. The result was Loyd admitting to the crime, and all of his brewery buildings being put up for auction. Around this time, Molson sensed the market potential for beer in the British colony. Prices for wine, rum, and port were rising and an influx of English and Irish immigrants were particularly partial to beer. In January 1785, Molson used the money inherited from his parents to acquire what had been the Thomas Loyd brewery on the shores of the St. Lawrence, just outside the fortifications of the burgeoning City of Montreal.

In June 1785, he temporarily closed his business to cross the Atlantic for modern equipment and ingredients. Upon his return, he offered the seeds free of charge to neighboring Montreal farmers, who agreed to grow them to satisfy the brewery&#x27;s need for malt. In 1786, just six weeks after taking the helm, Molson delivered his first brew, an ale. Priced at five cents a bottle, his brew sold well.

Molson took advantage of the many business opportunities available at the time. He quickly diversified his investments, opened a lumber yard, and began issuing loans to local Montreal merchants. In 1816, the family enterprise began to take shape when founder John Molson entered into an association with his three sons, John Jr., Thomas and William.

Although brewing proved to be Molson&#x27;s most sustainable field of endeavour, other activities were added throughout the company&#x27;s lengthy history. Molson was the first company to own and operate a fleet of steamboats, which were used to transport people and goods between Quebec and Ontario. John Molson and his sons also founded the Molson Bank, which later merged with the Bank of Montreal.

Thomas Molson would eventually follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps by continuing the Molson brewing tradition and upholding high standards of quality. In 1903, inspired by the popularity of imported beers, Thomas’ grandson Herbert Molson and brewmaster John Hyde created Molson Export, an authentic ale brewed in the classic style, developed by John Molson.

The Molson family were pioneers in steamships and hospitality, assisted with the Montreal General Hospital, were patrons of McGill University and the arts, and until 1925, were involved in banking through Molson Bank which merged with the Bank of Montreal.
Molson Brewery expanded the breadth of its corporate activities throughout the 20th century. In 1945, the family decided to transform the company into a public, limited-liability enterprise. It then became possible to acquire ownership in the company without being a member of the Molson family. This made it possible for the company to expand into lager and inaugurate a new brewery in Toronto (near the Canadian National Exhibition) in 1955. The Crown and Anchor brand of beer dates from this time. Two years later in 1957, the family (not the firm) acquired the Montreal Forum and the Montreal Canadiens. The company continued to develop and, in 1958, acquired six breweries, which included five establishments in Western Canada, giving Molson a nationwide presence. In 1989, the company consolidated market share in Quebec through a merger with Carling O&#x27;Keefe (acquiring Carling&#x27;s Toronto brewery in Etobicoke). As a result, Molson became the largest brewery in Canada and the fifth largest in the world.
Molson was once the owner of home improvement chains Beaver Lumber and Aikenhead&#x27;s Home Improvement Warehouse. In February 1994, Molson sold a 75% interest in Aikenhead&#x27;s to Home Depot Inc for $150 million with the option to buy the rest in 1999; in the event, they agreed on a price of $262 million. In 1997, Molson sold for CAD$147 million their interest in Reno-Depot to Castorama. In 1999 they sold Beaver Lumber to Home Hardware.

In 2005, Molson merged with US-based Coors to form Molson Coors Brewing Company. This was followed in 2007 by the opening of a new brewery in Moncton, New Brunswick. Sixth-generation family member Eric Molson retired in 2009; however, his sons Andrew and Geoff Molson continue to be active in company affairs as members of the corporate Board of Directors.

On October 11, 2016, SABMiller in the U.S. sold its interests (from the joint venture formed in the United States and Puerto Rico) in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, who had been its partner in the joint venture, for around US$12 billion. Molson Coors gained full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and retained the rights to all of the brands that were in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico.

In 2018, the company brewed and marketed a number of the most popular brands of beer in Canada. Domestic labels include Molson Canadian, Molson M, Molson Export, Molson Dry, Molson Exel Dealcoholized beer, Old Style Pilsner, Rickard&#x27;s, Creemore Springs, and Granville Island Brewing. Through partnerships with other major brewers, Molson Coors Canada also offers beer brands, including Coors Light, Miller Genuine Draft, Heineken, Foster&#x27;s Lager, and Tiger. Molson employs 3,000 people in Canada and operates five breweries in locations across the country (Chilliwack, Toronto, Montreal, Moncton, and St. John&#x27;s), as well as the Creemore micro-brewery in Ontario and Granville Island Brewing in British Columbia.

==Operations==


Molson Coors Canada is a unit of Molson Coors with operational headquarters located in Toronto (in addition to several breweries across Canada). Molson Coors Canada is part-owner of The Beer Store in Ontario (Brewers Retail Inc.), operating as a beer distribution and retail chain, which (protected by legislation) has an over 85% market share of the total Ontario industry beer sales. Molson Coors Canada owns 50% of Brewers Distribution Limited in Western Canada. Molson Coors Canada has the marketing and selling rights for Heineken in Canada.

On 30 October 2019, the Molson Coors Brewing Company announced it would change its name to Molson Coors Beverage Company as a part of a restructuring to take place in 2020. The name change would reflect the company&#x27;s growing focus on beverages outside of the traditional beer and brewing offerings. Additionally, the company would reorganize its global business units, including Molson Coors Canada, into Molson Coors North America, headquartered in Chicago, and Molson Coors Europe, headquartered in Prague.

Molson Coors breweries in Canada are in:
* Longueuil, Quebec
* Toronto, Ontario – former Carling O&#x27;Keefe plant in Etobicoke, which replaced the old Lakeshore plant (demolished and replaced by WaterParkCity development in 2006)
* St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador
* Chilliwack, British Columbia
* Creemore, Ontario – Creemore Springs
* Granville Island, British Columbia – Granville Island Brewing
* Shawinigan, Quebec – Trou du Diable
* Montreal, Quebec – Brasseur de Montréal

Former:
* Molson Brewery, Montreal, Quebec (1786–2022)
* Molson Brewery, Barrie – closed in 2000
*Molson Brewery, Edmonton – closed in 2007
*Molson Brewery, Vancouver – closed in 2019
*Molson Brewery, Toronto – closed in 1999

==Brands==

Molson brands include &quot;Carling Black Label&quot;, Molson Export and &quot;Molson Canadian&quot;.

==Relationship with NHL==
On June 20, 2009, brothers Geoff Molson and Andrew Molson, and their father Eric Molson announced the purchase of 80.1% of the Montreal Canadiens from Colorado businessman George Gillett. The Canadiens have historically been the NHL&#x27;s most successful hockey team and last won the Stanley Cup in 1993. Along with the current majority ownership that the Molson brothers have of the team, the Molson company has owned all or portions of the Montreal Canadiens. In June 2009, the consortium led by the Molson brothers acquired the remaining 19.9% of the team that had been held by the company.

In the second decade of the 21st century, Molson and/or Coors had exclusive rights to sell their beverages at the home arenas of the Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Edmonton Oilers, Colorado Avalanche, Arizona Coyotes, and Detroit Red Wings. Their beverages could be purchased at other sports venues, such as the home of the Buffalo Sabres, the KeyBank Center, the Philadelphia Flyers at the Wells Fargo Center, the Washington Capitals at the Verizon Center, and Bridgestone Arena, home of the Nashville Predators.

<doc id="322997" wikidata="Q179046" url="?curid=322997" title="Fatehpur Sikri">
<text>Fatehpur Sikri () is a town in the Agra District of Uttar Pradesh, India. Situated from the district headquarters of Agra, Fatehpur Sikri itself was founded as the capital of the Mughal Empire in 1571 by Emperor Akbar, serving this role from 1571 to 1585, when Akbar abandoned it due to a campaign in Punjab and was later completely abandoned in 1610.

The name of the city is derived from the village called &quot;Sikri&quot; which previously occupied the location. An Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) excavation from 1999 to 2000 indicated that there was housing, temples and commercial centres here before Akbar built his capital. The region was settled by Sungas following their expansion. It was controlled by Sakarwar Rajputs from the 7th to 16th century CE until the Battle of Khanwa (1527).

The &quot;khanqah&quot; of Sheikh Salim Chishti existed earlier at this place. Akbar&#x27;s son, Jahangir, was born in the village of Sikri to his favourite wife Mariam-uz-Zamani in 1569, and, in that year, Akbar began construction of a religious compound to commemorate the Sheikh who had predicted the birth. After Jahangir&#x27;s second birthday, he began the construction of a walled city and imperial palace here. The city came to be known as &quot;Fatehpur Sikri&quot;, the &quot;City of Victory&quot;, after Akbar&#x27;s victorious Gujarat campaign in 1573.

After occupying Agra in 1803, the East India Company established an administrative centre here and it remained so until 1850. In 1815, the Marquess of Hastings ordered the repair of monuments at Sikri.

Because of its historical importance as the capital of the Mughal Empire and its outstanding architecture, Fatehpur Sikri was awarded the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986.

==History==
Archaeological evidence points to settlement of the region since the Painted Grey Ware period. According to historian Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi, the region flourished under Sunga rule and then under Sikarwar Rajputs, who built a fortress when they controlled the area from 7th to 16th century, until the Battle of Khanwa (1527). The area later came under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate and many mosques were built at the place which grew in size during the period of the Khalji dynasty.

Basing his arguments on the excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in 1999–2000 at the Chabeli Tila, senior Agra journalist Bhanu Pratap Singh said the antique pieces, statues, and structures all point to a lost &quot;culture and religious site,&quot; more than 1,000 years ago. &quot;The excavations yielded a rich crop of Jain statues, hundreds of them, including the foundation stone of a temple with the date. The statues were a thousand years old of &quot;Bhagwan&quot; Adi Nath, &quot;Bhagwan&quot; Rishabh Nath, &quot;Bhagwan&quot; Mahavir and Jain Yakshinis,&quot; said Swarup Chandra Jain, senior leader of the Jain community. Historian Sugam Anand states that there is proof of habitation, temples and commercial centres even before Akbar established it as his capital. He states that the open space on a ridge was used by Akbar to build his capital.

But preceding Akbar&#x27;s appropriation of the site for his capital city, his predecessors Babur and Humayun did much to redesign Fatehpur Sikri&#x27;s urban layout. Attilio Petruccioli, a scholar of Islamic architecture and Professor of Landscape Architecture at the Polytechnic University of Bari, Italy, notes that &quot;Babur and his successors&quot; wanted &quot;to get away from the noise and confusion of Agra [and] build an uninterrupted sequence of gardens on the free left bank of the Yamuna, linked both by boat and by land.&quot; Petruccioli adds that when such escapist landscapes are envisioned, the monument becomes the organising element of the city at large, partly due to its orientation at a significant location and partly due to its sheer size. Buland Darwaza was one such organising element, which at a height of 150 feet towered over the city and is now one of the most recognisable Mughal monuments in the country.

The place was much loved by Babur, who called it &quot;Shukri&quot; (Thanks), after its large lake that was used by Mughal armies. Annette Beveridge in her translation of &quot;Baburnama&quot; noted that Babur points &quot;Sikri&quot; to read &quot;Shukri&quot;. Per his memoirs, Babur constructed a garden here called the &quot;Garden of Victory&quot; after defeating Rana Sangha at its outskirts. Gulbadan Begum&#x27;s &quot;Humayun-Nama&quot; describes that in the garden he built an octagonal pavilion which he used for relaxation and writing. In the center of the nearby lake, he built a large platform. A baoli exists at the base of a rock scarp about a kilometre from the Hiran Minar. This was probably the original site of a well-known epigraph commemorating his victory.

Abul Fazl records Akbar&#x27;s reasons for the foundation of the city in &quot;Akbarnama&quot;: &quot;In as much as his exalted sons (Salim and Murad) had been born at Sikri, and the God-knowing spirit of Shaikh Salim had taken possession thereof, his holy heart desired to give outward splendour to this spot which possessed spiritual grandeur. Now that his standards had arrived at this place, his former design was pressed forward, and an order was issued that the superintendents of affairs should erect lofty buildings for the special use of the Shahinshah.&quot;

Akbar remained heirless until 1569 when his son, who became known as Jahangir, was born in the village of Sikri in 1569. Akbar began the construction of a religious compound in honour of the Chisti saint Sheikh Salim, who had predicted the birth of Jahangir. After Jahangir&#x27;s second birthday, he began the construction of a walled city and imperial palace probably to test his son&#x27;s stamina. By constructing his capital at the &quot;khanqah&quot; of Sheikh Salim, Akbar associated himself with this popular Sufi order and brought legitimacy to his reign through this affiliation.

The city was founded in 1571 and was named after the village of Sikri which occupied the spot before. The Buland Darwaza was built in honour of his successful campaign in Gujarat, when the city came to be known as &quot;Fatehpur Sikri&quot; - &quot;The City of Victory&quot;. It was abandoned by Akbar in 1585 when he went to fight a campaign in Punjab. It was later completely abandoned by 1610. The reason for its abandonment is usually given as the failure of the water supply, though Akbar&#x27;s loss of interest may also have been the reason since it was built solely on his whim. Ralph Fitch described it as such, &quot;Agra and Fatehpore Sikri are two very great cities, either of them much greater than London, and very populous. Between Agra and Fatehpore are 12 miles (Kos) and all the way is a market of victuals and other things, as full as though a man were still in a town, and so many people as if a man were in a market.&quot;

Akbar visited the city only once in 1601 after abandoning it. William Finch, visiting it 4–5 years after Akbar&#x27;s death, stated, &quot;It is all ruinate,&quot; writing, &quot;lying like a waste desert.&quot; During the epidemic of bubonic plague from 1616 to 1624, Jahangir stayed for three months here in 1619. Muhammad Shah stayed here for some time and the repair works were started again. However, with the decline of Mughal Empire, the conditions of the buildings worsened.

While chasing Daulat Rao Sindhia&#x27;s battalions in October 1803, Gerard Lake left the most cumbersome baggage and siege guns in the town. After occupying Agra in 1803, the British established an administrative centre here and it remained so until 1850. In 1815, the Marquess of Hastings ordered the repair of monuments at Sikri and Sikandra. The town was a municipality from 1865 to 1904 and was later made a notified area. The population in 1901 was 7,147.

==Demographics==
As of 2011 Indian Census, Fatehpur Sikri had a total population of 32,905, of which 17,392 were males and 15,513 were females. Population within the age group of 0 to 6 years was 5,139. The total number of literates in Fatehpur Sikri was 17,236, which constituted 52.4% of the population with male literacy of 60.4% and female literacy of 43.4%. The effective literacy rate of 7+ population of Fatehpur Sikri was 62.1%, of which male literacy rate was 71.6% and female literacy rate was 51.4%. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population was 4,110 and 1 respectively. Fatehpur Sikri had 4936 households in 2011.

===Language===
According to the 2011 census, 98.81% of the people identified as Hindi speakers and 1.04% as Brajbhasha speakers.

==Government and politics==
Fatehpur Sikri is one of the fifteen Block headquarters in the Agra district. It has 52 Gram panchayats (Village Panchayat) under it.

The Fatehpur Sikri, is a constituency of the Lok Sabha, Lower house of the Indian Parliament, and further comprises five Vidhan Sabha(legislative assembly) segments:
* Agra Rural
* Fatehpur Sikri
* Kheragarh
* Fatehabad
* Bah

==Architecture==

Fatehpur Sikri sits on a rocky ridge, in length and wide, and the palace city is surrounded by a wall on three sides with the fourth bordered by a lake. The city is generally organised around this 40 m high ridge, and falls roughly into the shape of a rhombus. The general layout of the ground structures, especially the &quot;continuous and compact pattern of gardens and services and facilities&quot; that characterised the city leads urban archaeologists to conclude that Fatehpur Sikri was built primarily to afford leisure and luxury to its famous residents.

The dynastic architecture of Fatehpur Sikri was modelled on Timurid forms and styles. The city was built massively and preferably with red sandstone. Gujarati influences are also seen in its architectural vocabulary and decor of the palaces of Fatehpur Sikri. The city&#x27;s architecture reflects both the Hindu and Muslim form of domestic architecture popular in India at the time. The remarkable preservation of these original spaces allows modern archaeologists to reconstruct scenes of Mughal court life, and to better understand the hierarchy of the city&#x27;s royal and noble residents.

It is accessed through gates along the long fort wall, namely, Delhi Gate, the Lal Gate, the Agra Gate and Birbal&#x27;s Gate, Chandanpal Gate, The Gwalior Gate, the Tehra Gate, the Chor Gate, and the Ajmeri Gate. The palace contains summer palace and winter palace for Queen Mariam-uz-Zamani commonly known as Jodha Bai.



Some of the important buildings in this city, both religious and secular are:

* Buland Darwaza: Set into the south wall of congregational mosque, the Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri is high, from the ground, gradually making a transition to a human scale in the inside. The gate was added around five years after the completion of the mosque as a victory arch, to commemorate Akbar&#x27;s successful Gujarat campaign. It carries two inscriptions in the archway, one of which reads: &quot;Isa, Son of Mariam said: The world is a bridge, pass over it, but build no houses on it. He who hopes for an hour may hope for eternity. The world endures but an hour. Spend it in prayer, for the rest is unseen&quot;. The central portico comprises three arched entrances, with the largest one, in the centre, is known locally as the Horseshoe Gate, after the custom of nailing horseshoes to its large wooden doors for luck. Outside the giant steps of the Buland Darwaza to the left is a deep well.
* Jama Masjid: It is a &quot;Jama Mosque&quot; meaning the congregational mosque and was perhaps one of the first buildings to be constructed in the complex, as its epigraph gives AH 979 (A.D. 1571–72) as the date of its completion, with a massive entrance to the courtyard, the Buland Darwaza added some five years later. It was built in the manner of Indian mosques, with iwans around a central courtyard. A distinguishing feature is the row of &quot;chhatri&quot; over the sanctuary. There are three mihrabs in each of the seven bays, while the large central mihrab is covered by a dome, it is decorated with white marble inlay, in geometric patterns.
* Tomb of Salim Chishti: A white marble encased tomb of the Sufi saint Salim Chishti (1478–1572), within the Jama Masjid&#x27;s &quot;sahn&quot; (courtyard). The single-storey structure is built around a central square chamber, within which is the grave of the saint, under an ornate wooden canopy encrusted with mother-of-pearl mosaic. Surrounding it is a covered passageway for circumambulation, with carved &quot;Jalis&quot;, stone pierced screens all around with intricate geometric design and an entrance to the south. The tomb is influenced by earlier mausolea of the early 15th century Gujarat Sultanate period. Other striking features of the tomb are white marble serpentine brackets, which support sloping eaves around the parapet. On the left of the tomb, to the east, stands a red sandstone tomb of Islam Khan I, son of Shaikh Badruddin Chishti and grandson of Shaikh Salim Chishti, who became a general in the Mughal army in the reign of Jahangir. The tomb is topped by a dome and thirty-six small domed &quot;chattris&quot; and contains a number of graves, some unnamed, all male descendants of Shaikh Salim Chishti.
* Diwan-i-Aam: &quot;Diwan-i-Aam&quot; or Hall of Public Audience, is a building typology found in many cities where the ruler meets the general public. In this case, it is a pavilion-like multi-bayed rectangular structure fronting a large open space. South west of the Diwan-i-Am and next to the Turkic Sultana&#x27;s House stand Turkic Baths.
* Diwan-i-Khas: the &quot;Diwan-i-Khas&quot; or Hall of Private Audience, is a plain square building with four &quot;chhatris&quot; on the roof. However it is famous for its central pillar, which has a square base and an octagonal shaft, both carved with bands of geometric and floral designs, further its thirty-six serpentine brackets support a circular platform for Akbar, which is connected to each corner of the building on the first floor, by four stone walkways. It is here that Akbar had representatives of different religions discuss their faiths and gave private audience.
* Ibadat Khana: (House of Worship) was a meeting house built in 1575 by the Mughal Emperor Akbar, where the foundations of a new Syncretistic faith, &quot;Din-e-Ilahi&quot; were laid by Akbar.
* Anup Talao: Anup Talao was built by Raja Anup Singh Sikarwar. An ornamental pool with a central platform and four bridges leading up to it. Some of the important buildings of the royal enclave are surround by it including, &quot;Khwabgah&quot; (House of Dreams) Akbar&#x27;s residence, &quot;Panch Mahal&quot;, a five-storey palace, &quot;Diwan-i-Khas&quot;(Hall of Private Audience), &quot;Ankh Michauli&quot; and the Astrologer&#x27;s Seat, in the south-west corner of the Pachisi Court.
* Jodha Bai Mahal: The place of residence of Akbar&#x27;s favourite and chief Rajput wife, Mariam-uz-Zamani, commonly known as Jodha Bai, shows Rajput influence and is built around a courtyard, with special care being taken to ensure privacy. It also has a Hindu temple and a tulsi math used by his Hindu wife for worship. This palace was internally connected to the khawabgah of Akbar. 
* Naubat Khana: Also known as Naqqar Khana meaning a &quot;drum house&quot;, where musician used drums to announce the arrival of the Emperor. It is situated ahead of the &quot;Hathi Pol Gate&quot; or the Elephant Gate, the south entrance to the complex, suggesting that it was the imperial entrance.
* Pachisi Court: A square marked out as a large board game, the precursor to modern day Ludo game where people served as the playing pieces. Though many historians argue it to have been constructed in 17th century.
* Panch Mahal: A five-storied palatial structure, with the tiers gradually diminishing in size, until the final one, which is a single large-domed chhatri. Originally pierced stone screens faced the facade and probably sub-divided the interior as well, suggesting it was built for the ladies of the court. The floors are supported by intricately carved columns on each level, totalling to 176 columns in all.
* Birbal&#x27;s House: The house of Akbar&#x27;s favourite minister, who was a Hindu. Notable features of the building are the horizontal sloping sunshades or &quot;chajjas&quot; and the brackets which support them.
* Hiran Minar: The Hiran Minar, or Elephant Tower, is a circular tower covered with stone projections in the form of elephant tusks. Traditionally it was thought to have been erected as a memorial to the Emperor Akbar&#x27;s favourite elephant. However, it was probably a used as a starting point for subsequent mileposts.

Other buildings included &quot;Taksal&quot; (mint), &quot;Daftar Khana&quot; (Records Office), &quot;Karkhana&quot; (royal workshop), &quot;Khazana&quot; (Treasury), &quot;Hammam&quot; (Turkic Baths), &quot;Darogha&#x27;s&quot; quarters, stables, caravanserai, Hakim&#x27;s quarters, etc.

==In popular culture==
===In literature===

In her poetical illustration to an engraving of a painting by William Purser, &quot;Futtypore Sicri&quot; (Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833), Letitia Elizabeth Landon associates its abandonment by Akbar with &#x27;the revenge of the dead&#x27;.

Vita Sackville-West, in her novel &quot;All Passion Spent&quot;, places the key meeting between Deborah, Lady Slane, and Mr FitzGeorge, at Fatehpur Sikri. 

She stood again on the terrace of the deserted Indian city looking across the brown landscape where puffs of rising dust marked at intervals the road to Agra. She leaned her arms upon the warm parapet and slowly twirled her parasol. She twirled it because she was slightly ill at ease. She and the young man beside her were isolated from the rest of the world.
Salman Rushdie&#x27;s novel &quot;The Enchantress of Florence&quot; is partly set in 16th century Fatehpur Sikri.

<text>The Long Road is the fourth studio album by Canadian rock band Nickelback, released on September 23, 2003. Recorded at the famed Greenhouse Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia, it is the band&#x27;s final album with Ryan Vikedal as drummer, and features a notable change in style towards more aggressive guitar riffs and the inclusion of double bass drumming. The album is the first collaboration with producer Joey Moi; who engineered their previous album, &quot;Silver Side Up&quot;, and produced the band&#x27;s next three albums.

==Composition==
Most of the album&#x27;s songs were an experiment from the band into writing heavier downtuned riffs in either B or C tuning. On tracks such as &quot;Flat on the Floor&quot;, &quot;Because of You&quot;, and &quot;Throw Yourself Away&quot;; Vikedal implemented the use of double bass drumming. Despite this; the album features several prominent acoustic segments on songs such as &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;Believe it or Not&quot;, and &quot;Should&#x27;ve Listened&quot;. Kroeger&#x27;s lyrics often revolved around topics ranging from breakups, self-harm, sex, and personal motivation. Kroeger wrote the lyrics to &quot;Throw Yourself Away&quot; about Melissa Drexler&#x27;s infamous 1997 infanticide at her high school prom.

During the band&#x27;s appearance at Bizarre Festival in Weeze, Germany, on August 16, 2002; &quot;Figured You Out&quot; made its first live appearance.

&quot;Someday&quot; later made an appearance as a part of Nickelback&#x27;s appearance on MTV Unplugged in London on September 3, 2003.

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 in the United States and sold 200,000 copies in its first week of release. The album was quickly certified platinum by the RIAA on October 24, 2003; eventually being certified double-platinum on March 6, 2004. The album was later certified 3× Platinum in the United States on March 10, 2005; having sold 3,591,000 copies as of April 2011. It has sold over 5 million copies worldwide and was the sixth bestselling album of 2003, having also sold over 2 million copies internationally. It was later ranked No. 157 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s 200 Albums of the Decade.

==Critical reception==
The album received polarizing reviews from critics, journalists often praised the heavier musical direction and aggressive guitar riffs, but criticized the album&#x27;s misogynistic lyrics. The album was nominated for Rock Album of the Year at the 2004 Grammy Awards.

Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly praised the album for its musical compositions, lauding the angrier direction and Vikedal&#x27;s strong drumming on numerous tracks, claiming &quot;The band hammers each song home with a single-minded fervor, cannily melding metal, grunge, and melody. As a singer, Kroeger possesses that rarest of latter-day rock-star commodities: an instantly identifiable voice imbued with passion and edge&quot;.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album a modest review, criticizing Kroeger&#x27;s songwriting but also praising the production of the album in addition to the band&#x27;s darker change in musical direction, claiming &quot;Nickelback courts it through their audience-pleasing grunge pastiche, which treats the style as just another variation of hard rock&quot;.

==Tour==
The band embarked on tour in support of the album with Trapt and Three Days Grace hired as opening acts. Theory of a Deadman were later hired as an opening act in November 2003 replacing Trapt. The tour included 45 North American dates, 25 European dates, three Japanese dates, and five Australian dates, the second longest tour to date from the band. Prior to the second European leg, opening acts Theory of a Deadman and Three Days Grace were replaced by 3 Doors Down and Puddle of Mudd. Following the tour, on January 2, 2005, Nickelback unexpectedly fired Vikedal after a minor royalty disagreement, replacing him with 3 Doors Down drummer Daniel Adair. Kroeger later sued Vikedal to prevent him receiving any further royalties from the band&#x27;s music, though the matter was later settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.

<doc id="323004" wikidata="Q6470006" url="?curid=323004" title="Lady Bunny">
<text>Lady Bunny, previously known as Bunny Hickory Dickory Dock (born Jon Ingle, August 13, 1962), is an American drag queen, nightclub DJ, actor, comedian, and event organizer. She is the founder of the annual Wigstock event, as well as an occasional television and radio personality. She has released disco singles such as &quot;Shame, Shame, Shame!&quot; and &quot;The Pussycat Song&quot;, and has hosted two one-woman comedy shows, &#x27;That Ain&#x27;t No Lady!&#x27; and &#x27;Clowns Syndrome&#x27;.

== Personal life ==

=== Early life and education ===
Lady Bunny was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, but grew up in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and describes her childhood as having been &quot;wonderful and [she] lucked out in the parents department.&quot; Her mother is a retired registered nurse and her father is a history professor at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.

Growing up, she would try on costumes and outfits, and put on plays with the other kids in the neighborhood. Her family lived next to a florist and she would collect the thrown out ribbons in the garbage and turn them into costumes for the plays.

When Bunny was 11, her family moved to Ghana for a year to accommodate her father, who had received a Fulbright Scholarship. &quot;It was the best year of my life&quot;, she said, remembering banana trees in her backyard and a giant snake that slithered on the road. &quot;I still gag West African cab drivers by speaking the remnants of Fante. I can only say a few things, but it tickles them like crazy.&quot; She briefly attended Bootham School, a Quaker boarding school in York, England. Based on her experiences, Bunny regards the English education system to be better than the American one. Upon graduating, she enrolled at the University of Tennessee, where her father teaches, but later relocated to Atlanta, where she attended Georgia State University.

=== Present ===
Lady Bunny says she has an affinity for trans women and has considered transitioning. She spends her public life in drag and uses she/her pronouns. Lady Bunny is seldom seen out of women&#x27;s clothing. In a 2022 interview, Lady Bunny said &quot;I guess if I had to label myself, I would say I&#x27;m probably nonbinary, but I don&#x27;t feel the need to stipulate.&quot;

Lady Bunny currently lives in New York City. She does not often discuss personal matters, and has no known romantic partner or children.

==Career==
=== Atlanta ===
In Georgia, Lady Bunny met RuPaul. For a time they were go-go dancers for a band called the Now Explosion. Alongside Larry Tee, the two became fixtures on the Atlanta gay scene in the early 1980s. They appeared in a variety of low-budget films, including the &quot;Starbooty&quot; series. In the episode of RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race entitled &#x27;Roast in Peace&#x27;, RuPaul revealed that he was the first person to ever put Lady Bunny in drag, technically making him her drag mother. RuPaul and Lady Bunny later relocated to New York City together.

=== New York ===
In 1983, Lady Bunny moved to New York City, where she and RuPaul shared an apartment for a time. They worked at the Pyramid Club. She remembers that one of the first times she performed in New York she lip-synced Gloria Gaynor&#x27;s &quot;I Will Survive&quot; and fell during the performance, losing her wig and a shoe. Bunny&#x27;s performance style during this period blended lip sync, dance, and comedy. Her performances often included self-deprecating commentary, and short criticism of other performers broken up by short bits of dancing. During this period, she also held several odd jobs such as working in an ice cream parlor and in sales for publisher Ralph Ginzburg.

Soon, Lady Bunny became one of the Club Kids and in 1985, she organized the first Wigstock, an annual drag queen festival that lasted until 2005, and was later revived in 2018. The idea to revive Wigstock came from Neil Patrick Harris&#x27; husband, David Burtka. Wigstock became the subject of Chris Moukarbel&#x27;s 2019 documentary &quot;Wig&quot;, which included Debbie Harry, Kevin Aviance, Willam, and Neil Patrick Harris.

=== Controversy ===
At the 2024 Pridelines Masquerade Gala, Lady Bunny faced backlash after making controversial remarks during her acceptance speech, including jokes targeting local drag performer and Pridelines supporter Tiffany Fantasia. The incident followed weeks of criticism over Lady Bunny&#x27;s outspoken comments on social media, where she criticized Vice President Kamala Harris and her presidential campaign, causing tension among LGBTQ Democrats. In response to the backlash, Pridelines issued an apology, rescinded Lady Bunny’s National Icon Award, and reaffirmed their support for Fantasia, emphasizing the gala’s intended focus on unity and community.

=== Performance ===
Lady Bunny is known for her &quot;big curves, bigger hair&quot; and is one of the legendary and ubiquitous New York City drag queens that is still performing today. She is a staple of New York Fashion Week, she tours alongside cabaret shows, and DJs around the globe. She was DJ at Van Cleef &amp; Arpels&#x27; 40th anniversary party in Paris and for the Standard&#x27;s Black Out Party, which celebrated the 25th anniversary of Naomi Campbell&#x27;s fashion career. Lady Bunny is the regular DJ for Empire State Pride Agenda and has served as the in-house DJ for Visionaire and V Magazine. Lady Bunny is a huge music aficionado. Her favorite Blondie song is &quot;Fade Away and Radiate&quot;. &quot;Hideaway&quot; by Canadian musical Kiesza is a pop song Lady Bunny regularly spins during DJ sets for its popular and underrated appeal. Lady Bunny has been releasing her own original music since 1996. Lady Bunny has written and run two one-woman comedy shows at LGBT club &quot;La Escuelita&quot;, &#x27;That Ain&#x27;t No Lady!&#x27; and &#x27;Clowns Syndrome&#x27;, the latter receiving praise from the New York Times. Both comedy shows toured globally.

Bunny can put together a full drag look within 20 minutes and maintains that every drag look must include faux lashes and a good wig. Her style of drag performance is comedic and often involves the parodying of popular songs. She most often appears in blonde wigs, and frequently performed at XL Nightclub. She has shared the stage with other popular New York City Drag Queens like Bianca del Rio. Lady Bunny was featured on the European leg of the Werq the World Tour.

Lady Bunny is featured prominently in &quot;The Tyranny of Consciousness&quot;, a 2017 five-channel video installation by video artist Charles Atlas, which premiered at &quot;Viva Arte Viva&quot;, the 2017 Venice Biennale, curated by Christine Maciel. The video is now in the permanent collection of the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lady Bunny produced an online drag show called &#x27;Cuntagious&#x27;. In January 2021, she launched a podcast, &quot;Ebony and Irony&quot;, co-hosted by Monét X Change.

Lady Bunny has appeared in films such as &quot;Party Girl&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Wig&quot;, &quot;Peoria Babylon&quot;, &quot;Starrbooty&quot;, &quot;Another Gay Movie&quot;, and &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot;.

=== Television ===
In 2005, she was a roaster on the Comedy Central roast of Pamela Anderson and released her first DVD, &quot;Rated X for X-tra Retarded&quot;.

Lady Bunny served on the judges&#x27; panel on the spinoff show &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag U&quot;, which aired on the Logo TV network from 2010 to 2012. Lady Bunny was Dean of Drag and had a role of judge in the first season. In season 2 of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag U&quot;, the Dean of Drag role was expanded into a segment called &quot;Lady Lessons&quot;. During the fifth season of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, contestant Alaska Thunderfuck 5000 impersonated Bunny for the Snatch Game. Episode 5 (&quot;Roast in Peace&quot;) of the fourth season of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race All Stars&quot; features a roast of Lady Bunny at a mock funeral.

In 2003, Lady Bunny made a guest appearance in the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; episode &quot;Boy, Interrupted&quot;, as the emcee at the LGBT prom.

In 2021, Lady Bunny featured in &quot;NewsBeat&quot;, a news show written by Luke Evendon with executive producer Clay Aiken.

=== Writing ===
Lady Bunny worked as a commentator for Star Magazine&#x27;s &#x27;Worst of the Week&#x27; column. She has also written for Paper Magazine, Interview, Out, Time Out, Visionaire, and Huffington Post. According to her own website, she is currently working on a memoir.

<text>Andravida (, ) is a town and a former municipality in Elis, in the northwest of the Peloponnese peninsula of Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Andravida-Kyllini, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 40.728 km2. Its population is about 3,700. The town was the capital of the Frankish Principality of Achaea in the late Middle Ages.

== Location ==
Andravida is located in the plains of northwestern Elis, at about 7 km from the Ionian Sea coast. It is 3 km south of Lechaina, 6 km north of Gastouni, 30 km northwest of Pyrgos and 55 km southwest of Patras.

The Greek National Road 9 (also E55) Patras-Pyrgos-Pylos passes east of the town. The Andravida Air Base is 2.5 km to the east of the city center.

==Population==
==History==

Andravida&#x27;s early history is obscure: the name is of unknown provenance—several proposals have been made, the most probable of which is that it derives from a Slavic name for &quot;place of the otters&quot;—and the site is not mentioned before the conquest by the Crusaders in 1205, even though it certainly existed before that. According to the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot;, Andravida, like most of the towns and regions of the northern and western Peloponnese, was captured without a fight in 1205 by the Crusader leader William of Champlitte, and it was there that the local Greek magnates and lords of Elis and of the mountains of Skorta and Mesarea paid him homage and recognized him as their lord.

Soon after the Frankish conquest, Andravida (known as &quot;Andreville&quot; in French, &quot;Andrevilla&quot; in Aragonese and &quot;Andravilla&quot; in Italian) became the residence of the princes of the newly established Principality of Achaea. As the medievalist Antoine Bon points out, Andravida&#x27;s choice as the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the principality rested on its favourable location: situated in the midst of the fertile plain of Elis, it was well provisioned and could sustain horses, it was located near the major port town of Glarentza, but not on the coast and hence not vulnerable to seaborne raids, and was equally far from the mountains of the central Peloponnese with their rebellious inhabitants. Consequently, despite its importance, it was never fortified. The town also became the seat of a Roman Catholic bishopric, attested since 1212, which assimilated the pre-existing Greek bishopric of Olena and retained the latter&#x27;s name.

Only a few traces survive of the Frankish town, and most of the testimony about its buildings comes from literary sources: a palace for the Princes; the Church of Saint Stephen, possibly belonging to the Franciscans; the Church and hospice of Saint James, given to the Teutonic Order in 1241 and serving as the burial place for the princely House of Villehardouin; the convent of Saint Nicholas of Carmel; and the Church of Saint Sophia, serviced by the Dominicans and the largest of them all, by virtue of which it often served as the site of assemblies and parliaments of the principality&#x27;s nobility. Early 19th-century travellers like François Pouqueville and Jean Alexandre Buchon reported that the three churches were still largely extant, but today only Saint Sophia survives to a substantial extent.

Like the rest of the Principality&#x27;s remnants in Elis and Achaea, Andravida was conquered by the Despotate of the Morea in the late 1420s. In 1460 it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and remained under Ottoman rule, with the exception of a brief Venetian period in 1686–1715, until Greek independence.

==People==
*Konstantinos Andravidiotis, chieftain of the Greek War of Independence.

==Subdivisions==

The municipal unit Andravida is subdivided into the following communities (constituent villages in brackets):
*Andravida (Andravida, Agios Georgios), pop. 3,172 in 2021
*Stafidokampos, pop. 290
*Strousi, pop. 291

The small village Agios Georgios (pop. 62) lies 6 km east of Andravida town centre, on the east side of the air base.

<text>Ithaca Tompkins International Airport is a county-owned airport located in the Town of Lansing, three miles northeast of Ithaca, the county seat and only city in Tompkins County, New York. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2025–2029 categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; facility. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 60,848 passenger boardings in 2023.

Nonstop scheduled commercial commuter-jet service is available to John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport.

==History==

The original Ithaca Municipal Airport was west of downtown Ithaca, near the inlet of Cayuga Lake. The site was identified as a likely flying field in 1914 by pilot Charles Niles, who considered relocating to Ithaca to establish a practice field. In December 1914, the Thomas Brothers Aeroplane Co. relocated to Ithaca and in 1915 established a flying school using the lake and a field near the inlet.

Established prior to 1916, Ithaca Municipal Airport is believed to be the second airport to be established in New York state. The airport initially had two sod runways, but by 1937 it had a north/south asphalt runway and a turf landing strip. The turf runway was no longer in official guidebooks by 1940. Due to its lakeshore location, the airport also provided a dock and anchorage for seaplanes. Bound by the Lehigh Valley Railroad freight yards on the south side, the Cayuga Lake marshes on the north side and fog in the lake valley, the growth potential for the airport was limited. The former airport site is now Cass Park, including a hangar which was renovated in 1975 to house the Hangar Theatre.

In 1946, Cornell University and the city of Ithaca began planning for a new airport on East Hill on the university-owned land in Lansing, New York. East Hill Airport opened in 1948 with Robinson Airlines as its primary tenant. On July 1, 1956, the 23 parcels of land that made up the airport were conveyed by Cornell University to Tompkins County for the sum of $324,500 (). At that point, East Hill Airport was renamed Tompkins County Airport; it later was renamed Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport.

The original municipal airport was the base for Aviation pioneer Cecil Robinson&#x27;s aerial photography missions. In 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, he created Robinson Airlines at the municipal airport before transferring operations to the new East Hill Airport in 1948. Scheduled DC-3 flights to East Hill began in 1948; the airline changed its name to Mohawk Airlines in 1952 and merged with Allegheny Airlines in 1972. Later, the airport was served by Empire Airlines and Air North; the latter became Brockway Air, which merged into Piedmont Airlines. Allegheny, Piedmont and Empire all eventually merged into US Airways, which later merged into American Airlines. Other carriers included Commuter Airlines, Mall Airways, Command Airways (later operating under the name American Eagle), Ransome Airlines (also operating under the name TW Express, United Express) and Continental Express.

Another aviation pioneer, Ruth Carol Taylor, was the first African-American flight attendant in American commercial aviation history. Her first flight was a Mohawk Airlines flight departing Ithaca on February 11, 1958.

===Expansion===
In 1994, a new, , $11-million terminal opened, replacing the cramped original building. Simultaneously, the runway was extended from to ; the runway was subsequently extended in 2009 to its present as part of a runway-safety extension project that added of additional takeoff pavement to Runway 14. Runway 32 has an instrument landing system and a medium-intensity approach light system with runway alignment lights. Runway 14 has an instrument approach based on the VOR/DME at the airport. A short turf runway was commissioned parallel to the paved runway, but during the 1980s a north–south turf runway was west of the terminal building, about long and wide.

Airline traffic peaked in 1990 at 226,813 passengers, but by the end of the decade the small size of the market and proximity to Syracuse Hancock International Airport and other regional airports led Trans World Airlines, United Airlines and finally Continental Airlines to leave.

In 2001, the airport renamed itself the Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport, replacing its former moniker: the Tompkins County Airport.

In late 2004, after negotiations with the county, Northwest Airlines agreed to add Northwest Airlink service to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, which began on May 2, 2005. US Airways nonstops to Pittsburgh, a focus city, resumed on November 9, 2005, but ended on April 1, 2006, due to low yield. Passenger traffic has improved with the additional service; the airport served about 140,000 passengers in 2004, increasing to around 170,000 in 2007. On October 6, 2008, Continental Connection resumed service between Ithaca and Newark Liberty International Airport with four daily flights. In 2011, the airport served 242,493 passengers on three airlines.

In 2009, Regional Elite Airline Services took over ground-handling duties from Mesaba Airlines for the Delta Connection flights to Detroit. As of November, 2012, all ground-handling for Delta and United Airlines was handled by DAL Global Services.

Starting on March 24, 2012, US Airways Express ended all service between Ithaca and New York–LaGuardia as part of a slot-exchange deal with Delta.

The 2013 Federal sequester did not result in the closure of the airport&#x27;s control tower. The U.S. Department of Transportation restored the funding needed to support the continued operation of the Ithaca airport control tower.

In 2014, Robert Nichols, who had been the airport&#x27;s general manager since 1990, retired.

On September 12, 2017, the airport announced that it had been awarded $2.4 million in grants from the FAA to rehabilitate the general aviation tarmac, add new perimeter fencing and lighting and build a second passenger boarding bridge. Simultaneously, United Airlines announced that it was upgrading its Ithaca to Newark service from 37-seat Dash 8 turboprop aircraft to 50-seat Embraer ERJ-145 commuter-jet aircraft, meaning that all commercial passenger flights to and from Ithaca would be aboard jet aircraft.
On May 3, 2018, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced (at the airport) a new $22 million project to double the size of the 25-year-old airport terminal, adding six new gates, three new jet bridges and a customs facility to allow international air travel to Ithaca, as well as expanded office space for the Transportation Security Administration and the serving airlines. Cuomo returned to Ithaca on October 16, 2018, to help break-ground for the newly renamed &quot;Ithaca-Tompkins International Airport.&quot; At groundbreaking, the total cost was expected to be $24.7 million, and the renovated terminal would include a restaurant and bar. The addition was designed by architecture firm C&amp;S Companies.

On July 12, 2018, the airport announced that American Airlines would start nonstop service to Charlotte, North Carolina, with one weekly flight on Saturdays beginning in December, 2018 (operating daily as of March 2022). At the same time, United Airlines announced the cancellation of its service to Newark, replacing it with a nonstop to Washington-Dulles International Airport effective October 4 (canceled on March 2, 2022).

The second phase of construction began in the spring of 2019 and was completed on December 20, 2019. Construction costs had increased to $14.2 million in state funding, $10 million in federal funding and $10.6 million from Tompkins County: $34.8 million.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, flights to and from Philadelphia were dropped in September, 2020.

==Facilities==
The airport covers at an elevation of . It has two runways: 14/32 is asphalt and 15/33 is turf.

In 2011 the airport had 41,286 aircraft operations, average 113 per day: 77% general aviation, 23% air taxi, &lt;1% military, and &lt;1% airline. 57 aircraft were then based at the airport: 77% single-engine, 9% multi-engine, and 14% jet.

United Express uses the two-class Bombardier CRJ550 between ITH and Newark International Airport (EWR). Delta Connection uses the Bombardier CRJ900 between ITH and John F. Kennedy International Airport/JFK.

<text>Jailhouse Blues (1929) is a short musical film released by Columbia Pictures. It features Mamie Smith, who was a top star in Black Vaudeville and a recording artist with Okeh Records. By the time &quot;Jailhouse Blues&quot; was made her contract with Okeh had ended. Basil Smith directed. The film and its soundtrack have been rediscovered.

==Synopsis==
Mamie is missing her man and finds him in jail. She pleads through her singing for his release.

==Cast==
*Mamie Smith
*Homer Tutt
* Porter Grainger
* Billy Mitchell 
*Andrew Fairchild

==Related history and preservation status==
Two songs were prerecorded by Victor Records, &quot;Jailhouse Blues&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do It!&quot; as for the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

The visual element has been held at the Library of Congress for a long time, but no soundtrack disc was known. At one point a disc was located but was destroyed accidentally in shipping. An intact disc was discovered in Australia in 2009 and, as of this writing (March 2011) the short is slated for preservation. Two short clips from &quot;Jailhouse Blues&quot; were shown on a 1961 DuPont Show of the Week broadcast, and this has served as the source of the widely circulated clips and audio from the film since.

<text>The Yale school is a colloquial name for an influential group of literary critics, theorists, and philosophers of literature that were influenced by Jacques Derrida&#x27;s philosophy of deconstruction. Many of the theorists were affiliated with Yale University in the late 1970s, although a number of the theorists – including Derrida himself – subsequently moved to or became affiliated with the University of California, Irvine.

==Relationship to deconstruction==
As a school of thought, the Yale School is more closely allied with the post-structuralist dimensions of deconstruction as opposed to its phenomenological dimensions. Additionally, the Yale School is philosophically affined to the 1970s version of deconstruction that John D. Caputo has described as a &quot;Nietzschean free play of signifiers&quot; and not the 1990s version of deconstruction that was far more concerned with political and ethical questions.

==Origins==
During the period between the late 1960s and the early 1980s, Yale University was the home of a variety of thinkers who were indebted to deconstruction. The group included high-profile literary scholars such as Shoshana Felman, Paul de Man, Geoffrey Hartman, J. Hillis Miller, and Harold Bloom. This group came to be known as the &quot;Yale School&quot; and was especially influential in literary criticism because de Man, Miller, Hartman and Bloom are all considered to be prominent literary critics. The four critics listed above, along with Derrida, contributed to an influential anthology, &quot;Deconstruction and Criticism&quot;. However, Harold Bloom&#x27;s position was always somewhat different from that of the rest of the group, and he later distanced himself from deconstruction.

==Book summaries==

===&quot;Deconstruction and Criticism&quot; (1979)===
In his introduction to &quot;Deconstruction and Criticism&quot;, Hartman draws a distinction between Derrida, Miller, and de Man on the one hand, and himself and Bloom on the other. The former category he refers to as &quot;boa-deconstructors&quot; who pursue deconstruction to its utmost conclusions and who are more philosophically rigorous in their writings.

Hartman claims that both himself and Bloom are &quot;barely deconstructionists&quot; and that they &quot;even write against it on occasion.&quot; Hartman claims that his writing style in particular is more reliant on the traditional role of pathos as a fundamental impetus for literary language. In contrast, deconstruction as advocated by Derrida seeks to reveal that the very notion of pathos is caught up in the rhetorical play which is endemic to language.

==Move to Irvine==
After teaching at Yale from 1972 to 1986, J. Hillis Miller left for the University of California, Irvine, where he was the Distinguished Research Professor of English and Comparative Literature. He died in 2021.

Shortly after J. Hillis Miller&#x27;s arrival at UC Irvine in 1986, Derrida himself became Professor of the Humanities at UCI. Derrida remained at UCI until 2003, one year before his death. Until his death, Derrida had slowly been turning over lecture manuscripts, journals and other materials to UCI&#x27;s special collections library under an agreement he signed in 1990. After Derrida&#x27;s death, his widow and sons said they wanted copies of UCI&#x27;s archives shared with the Institute of Contemporary Publishing Archives in France. The university had sued in an attempt to get manuscripts and correspondence from Derrida&#x27;s widow and children that it believed the philosopher had promised to UC Irvine&#x27;s collection, although the suit was dropped in 2007.

The Irvine Langson Library Special Collections also houses the Paul de Man Papers, a collection of personal and professional papers documenting de Man&#x27;s work in comparative literature.

<text>Saccharin, also called saccharine, benzosulfimide, or E954, or used in saccharin sodium or saccharin calcium forms, is a non-nutritive artificial sweetener. Saccharin is a sultam that is about 500 times sweeter than sucrose, but has a bitter or metallic aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. It is used to sweeten products, such as drinks, candies, baked goods, tobacco products, excipients, and for masking the bitter taste of some medicines. It appears as white crystals and is odorless. 

==Etymology==
Saccharin derives its name from the word &quot;saccharine&quot;, meaning &quot;sugary&quot;. The word saccharine is used figuratively, often in a derogative sense, to describe something &quot;unpleasantly over-polite&quot; or &quot;overly sweet&quot;. Both words are derived from the Greek word (&quot;sakkharon&quot;) meaning &quot;gravel&quot;. Similarly, saccharose is an obsolete name for sucrose (table sugar).

==Properties==
Saccharin is heat-stable. It does not react chemically with other food ingredients; as such, it stores well. Blends of saccharin with other sweeteners are often used to compensate for each sweetener&#x27;s weaknesses and faults. A 10:1 cyclamate–saccharin blend is common in countries where both these sweeteners are legal; in this blend, each sweetener masks the other&#x27;s offtaste. Saccharin is often used with aspartame in diet carbonated soft drinks, so some sweetness remains should the fountain syrup be stored beyond aspartame&#x27;s relatively short shelf life.
In its acid form, saccharin is not water-soluble. The form used as an artificial sweetener is usually its sodium salt. The calcium salt is also sometimes used, especially by people restricting their dietary sodium intake. Both salts are highly water-soluble: 0.67 g/ml in water at room temperature.

==Safety and health effects==
In the 1970s, studies performed on laboratory rats found an association between consumption of high doses of saccharin and the development of bladder cancer. However, further study determined that this effect was due to a mechanism that is not relevant to humans (deposition of crystals; see section). Epidemiological studies have shown no evidence that saccharin is associated with bladder cancer in humans. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) originally classified saccharin in Group 2B (&quot;possibly carcinogenic to humans&quot;) based on the rat studies, but downgraded it to Group 3 (&quot;not classifiable as to the carcinogenicity to humans&quot;) upon review of the subsequent research.

Saccharin has no food energy and no nutritional value. It is safe to consume for individuals with diabetes or prediabetes.

People with sulfonamide allergies can experience allergic reactions to saccharin, although it has been suggested that this may be due to a general predisposition to allergic reactions rather than a specific cross-reaction between antimicrobial sulfonamides and non-antimicrobial ones (like saccharin).

==History==

Saccharin was produced first in 1879, by Constantin Fahlberg, a chemist working on coal tar derivatives in Ira Remsen&#x27;s laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. Fahlberg noticed a sweet taste on his hand one evening, and connected this with the compound benzoic sulfimide on which he had been working that day. Fahlberg and Remsen published articles on benzoic sulfimide in 1879 and 1880. In 1884, then working on his own in New York City, Fahlberg applied for patents in several countries, describing methods of producing this substance that he named saccharin. Two years later, he began production of the substance in a factory in a suburb of Magdeburg in Germany. Fahlberg would soon grow wealthy, while Remsen merely grew irritated, believing he deserved credit for substances produced in his laboratory. On the matter, Remsen commented, &quot;Fahlberg is a scoundrel. It nauseates me to hear my name mentioned in the same breath with him.&quot;

Although saccharin was commercialized not long after its discovery, until sugar shortages during World War I, its use had not become widespread. Its popularity further increased during the 1960s and 1970s among dieters, since saccharin is a calorie-free sweetener. In the United States, saccharin is often found in restaurants in pink packets; the most popular brand is &quot;Sweet&#x27;n Low&quot;.

Due to the difficulty of importing sugar from the West Indies during World War I, the British Saccharin Company was founded in 1917 to produce saccharin at its Paragon Works near Accrington, Lancashire. Production was licensed and controlled by the Board of Trade in London. Production continued on the site until 1926.

===Government regulation===
Starting in 1907, the United States Food and Drug Administration began investigating saccharin as a result of the Pure Food and Drug Act. Harvey Wiley, then the director of the bureau of chemistry for the FDA, viewed it as an illegal substitution of a valuable ingredient, sugar, by a less valuable ingredient. In a clash that had career consequences, Wiley told President Theodore Roosevelt, &quot;Everyone who ate that sweet corn was deceived. He thought he was eating sugar, when in point of fact he was eating a coal tar product totally devoid of food value and extremely injurious to health.&quot; But Roosevelt himself was a consumer of saccharin, and, in a heated exchange, Roosevelt angrily answered Wiley by stating, &quot;Anybody who says saccharin is injurious to health is an idiot.&quot; The episode proved the undoing of Wiley&#x27;s career.

In 1911, Food Inspection Decision 135 stated that foods containing saccharin were adulterated. However, in 1912, Food Inspection Decision 142 stated that saccharin was not harmful.

More controversy was stirred in 1969 with the discovery of files from the FDA&#x27;s investigations of 1948 and 1949. These investigations, which had originally argued against saccharin use, were shown to prove little about saccharin being harmful to human health. In 1977, the FDA made an attempt to completely ban the substance, following studies showing that the substance caused bladder cancer in rats. The attempted ban was unsuccessful due to public opposition that was encouraged by industry advertisements, and instead the following label was mandated: &quot;Use of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals&quot;. That requirement was dropped in 2000 following new research that concluded humans reacted differently than rats and were not at risk of cancer at typical intake levels. (See also: below.) The sweetener has continued to be widely used in the United States and is now the third-most popular artificial sweetener behind sucralose and aspartame.

In the European Union, saccharin is also known by the E number (additive code) E954.

The current status of saccharin is that it is allowed in most countries, and countries such as Canada have lifted their previous ban of it as a food additive. The claims that it is associated with bladder cancer were shown to be unfounded in experiments on primates. (It is, however, prohibited to mail saccharin tablets or packets to France.)

Saccharin was formerly on California&#x27;s list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer for the purposes of Proposition 65, but it was delisted in 2001.

====Warning label addition and removal====
In 1958, the United States Congress amended the Food, Drugs, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 with the Delaney clause to mandate that the Food and Drug Administration not approve substances that &quot;induce cancer in man, or, after tests, [are] found to induce cancer in animals.&quot; Studies in laboratory rats during the early 1970s linked saccharin with the development of bladder cancer in rodents. As a consequence, all food containing saccharin was labeled with a warning meeting the requirement of the Saccharin Study and Labeling Act of 1977.

However, in 2000, the warning labels were removed because scientists learned that rodents, unlike humans, have a unique combination of high pH, high calcium phosphate, and high protein levels in their urine. One or more of the proteins that are more prevalent in male rats combine with calcium phosphate and saccharin to produce microcrystals that damage the lining of the bladder. Over time, the rat&#x27;s bladder responds to this damage by overproducing cells to repair the damage, which leads to tumor formation. Since this does not occur in humans, there is no elevated risk of bladder cancer.

The delisting of saccharin led to legislation repealing the warning label requirement for products containing saccharin. In 2001, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the state of California reversed their positions on saccharin, declaring it safe for consumption. The FDA&#x27;s decision followed a 2000 determination by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&#x27; National Toxicology Program to remove saccharin from its list of carcinogens.

The Environmental Protection Agency has officially removed saccharin and its salts from their list of hazardous constituents and commercial chemical products. In a release in December 2010, the EPA stated that saccharin is no longer considered a potential hazard to human health.

==Chemistry==

===Preparation===
Saccharin can be produced in various ways. The original route by Remsen and Fahlberg starts with toluene; another route begins with &quot;o&quot;-chlorotoluene. Sulfonation of toluene by chlorosulfonic acid gives the &quot;ortho&quot; and &quot;para&quot; substituted sulfonyl chlorides. The &quot;ortho&quot; isomer is separated and converted to the sulfonamide with ammonia. Oxidation of the methyl substituent gives the carboxylic acid, which cyclicizes to give saccharin free acid:

In 1950, an improved synthesis was developed at the Maumee Chemical Company of Toledo, Ohio. In this synthesis, the methyl anthranilate successively reacts with nitrous acid (from sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid), sulfur dioxide, chlorine, and then ammonia to yield saccharin:

===Properties and reactions===
The free acid of saccharin has a low p&quot;K&quot;a of 1.6 (the acidic hydrogen being that attached to the nitrogen). Saccharin can be used to prepare exclusively disubstituted amines from alkyl halides via a nucleophilic substitution, followed by a Gabriel synthesis.

<text>James Fleming Fagan (March 1, 1828September 1, 1893) was an American farmer, politician, and senior officer of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. His brigade distinguished itself in the Camden Expedition of 1864, helping to drive the U.S. Army&#x27;s Seventh Corps from southwest Arkansas.

== Early life ==
James Fleming Fagan was born in Clark County, Kentucky. When he was ten years old, his family moved to Little Rock. His father had been hired to work on the Arkansas State House. His father died during his youth and his mother, Catherine A. Fagan, in 1842 married Samuel Adams, who became acting governor of Arkansas two years later. After his stepfather&#x27;s death, Fagan took control of the family farm along the Saline River in southern Arkansas. Though he was a member of the Whig Party, he represented the heavily Democratic Saline County for two terms in the General Assembly. Fagan served in the United States Volunteers during the Mexican–American War with Company C, Arkansas Mounted Infantry Regiment, under Colonel Archibald Yell and was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant.

== American Civil War ==
At the start of the American Civil War, Fagan raised a company for the Confederate States Army and became its captain. When his unit was folded in with the 1st Arkansas Infantry Regiment on May 6, 1861, the very day that Arkansas seceded from the Union, he was elected as colonel of the combined 900-man regiment. They were formally mustered into service in Lynchburg, Virginia in May 1861. His regiment was a part of the first wave of Confederate attacks under General Albert Sidney Johnston at the Battle of Shiloh. He also participated in the Siege of Corinth, but fell into disfavor with his superior officer, General Braxton Bragg.

Fagan was soon transferred to the Trans-Mississippi Theater, where he fought at the battles of Cane Hill and Prairie Grove in command of the 1st Arkansas Cavalry Regiment. He was promoted to brigadier-general on September 12, 1862, and assumed command of a brigade composed of the 34th Arkansas, 35th Arkansas, 37th Arkansas, and Hawthorn&#x27;s Arkansas infantry regiments. Fagan played a central role in the Battle of Helena, where he and his Arkansas brigade made repeated frontal assaults on United States artillery batteries. During the Little Rock Campaign, Fagan was given temporary command of Sterling Price&#x27;s division.

Fagan fought in the Camden Expedition, including the successful destruction of a Federal supply train at the Battle of Marks&#x27; Mills, which led to the Federal retreat from southern Arkansas. In recognition for his service in the Camden Expedition, he was promoted to major-general on April 24, 1864, and commanded the Arkansas division of Confederate cavalry during Price&#x27;s Missouri Expedition. His division broke in a &quot;disgraceful manner&quot; during the failed assault on Fort Davidson at Pilot Knob, Missouri. During Price&#x27;s withdrawal from Missouri and Kansas, Fagan and John S. Marmaduke&#x27;s divisions were overwhelmed at the Battle of Mine Creek. The end of the war found Fagan in command of the District of Arkansas of the Trans-Mississippi Department, which was active militarily until late April 1865.

== Later life ==
Fagan was paroled by United States military authorities on June 20, 1865. After his parole, he returned to his farm to make a living. Fagan commanded Joseph Brooks&#x27; militia forces during the so-called Brooks-Baxter War of 1874, despite Fagan&#x27;s former service as a Confederate States Army general.

He was appointed United States Marshal by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1875, working for &quot;Hanging Judge&quot; Parker. In this capacity, Fagan recruited Bass Reeves as the first black deputy marshal to work west of the Mississippi River.

He served as a receiver for the United States Land Office in 1877. In 1890, Fagan ran for the office of state railroad commissioner but was defeated. He died of malaria in Little Rock, Arkansas, and was buried at the historic Mount Holly Cemetery in that city.

== Personal life ==
Fagan&#x27;s first wife was the sister of Confederate States Army general William N. R. Beall. He was also related by marriage to Arkansas governor Henry M. Rector.

==Legacy==
Chapter No. 280 of the Military Order of the Stars and Bars in Jonesboro, Arkansas, was named after him.

<text>James Fagan (born 1972) is an Australian-born folk musician. He is a singer and multi-instrumentalist specialising in the Irish bouzouki. From the early 1980s he toured in a family band, the Fagans. He began travelling to England in 1995, where he met and began working with English folk musician, Nancy Kerr. The couple married in 2007 in Bath.

== Biography ==

Born in Canberra in 1972, James Fagan was the first child of local folk singers Bob and Margaret Fagan. Bob and Margaret, James and his sister Kate formed the Fagans, who have toured the Australian folk scene since the early 1980s. Fagan&#x27;s first instrument was piano. By his teens, he was singing, playing guitar, and playing the clarinet. In 1994, he joined Alistair Hulett&#x27;s backing band, the Hooligans, which included Jimmy Gregory. Gregory introduced Fagan to the guitar-shaped, Irish bouzouki which is now his main instrument. Singing remains his first and foremost musical love.

He completed his medical training in 1995 and was on holiday in England when he met Nancy Kerr. They formed a duo which has become the mainstay of their career. 

Fagan is best known for his work with Kerr whom he married in 2007, and with whom he won BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards &#x27;Best Duo&#x27; in both 2003 and 2011. Together they have released seven albums: &quot;Starry Gazy Pie&quot; (1997), &quot;Scalene&quot; (with Sandra Kerr) (1998), &quot;Steely Water&quot; (1999), &quot;Between The Dark and Light&quot; (2002), &quot;Strands of Gold&quot; (2006), &quot;Twice Reflected Sun&quot; (2010), and &quot;An Evening with Nancy Kerr and James Fagan - LIVE&quot; (2019).

In 2008 Kerr and Fagan were joined by concertina player Robert Harbron to form the trio &quot;Kerr Fagan Harbron&quot;, recording and touring the album &quot;Station House&quot;. In 2010 Kerr and Fagan formed the Melrose Quartet with Sheffield duo Richard and Jess Arrowsmith. Melrose Quartet was nominated for Best Group at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards 2014.

Fagan is part of his wife Nancy Kerr&#x27;s Sweet Visitor Band, playing on the CDs Sweet Visitor (2014) and Instar (2016).

Fagan is well respected in his own right on the UK music scene – his other projects include being a member of The Cara Dillon Band, Melrose Quartet (with Nancy Kerr, Richard Arrowsmith and Jess Arrowsmith) and heavy metal English Ceilidh band The Glorystrokes. He has also toured as part of Bellowhead. Fagan also works in a duo called The James Brothers, with Jamie McClennan, the New Zealand fiddle player and partner of Scottish folk singer Emily Smith.

Since 2014 Fagan has been a regular presenter on his local community radio station Sheffield Live hosting the two hour Friday morning folk show Thank Goodness It&#x27;s Folk.

<text>The University of Nebraska–Lincoln (Nebraska, NU, or UNL) is a public land-grant research university in Lincoln, Nebraska, United States. Chartered in 1869 by the Nebraska Legislature as part of the Morrill Act of 1862, the school was the University of Nebraska until 1968, when it absorbed the Municipal University of Omaha to form the University of Nebraska system. It is the state&#x27;s oldest university and the flagship institution of the state-wide system. The university has been governed by the Board of Regents since 1871, whose members are elected by district to six-year terms.

The university is organized into nine colleges: Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Architecture, Arts and Sciences, Business, Education and Human Sciences, Engineering, Fine and Performing Arts, Journalism and Mass Communications, and Law. NU offers over two hundred degrees across its undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs. The school also offers programs through the University of Nebraska Omaha College of Public Affairs and Community Service, the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Dentistry and College of Nursing, and the Peter Kiewit Institute, which is managed in partnership with the Kiewit Corporation.

Nebraska is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. According to the National Science Foundation, Nebraska spent $320 million on research and development in 2020. Between its three campus locations (City Campus, East Campus, and Nebraska Innovation Campus) the university has over one hundred classroom buildings and research facilities. The university&#x27;s enrollment in 2021 was 19,552 undergraduate students and 4,879 graduate students, with 1,595 full-time or part-time instructional faculty. Undergraduate admission to the school is considered &quot;more selective.&quot;

Nebraska&#x27;s athletic programs, known as the Cornhuskers, compete in NCAA Division I and are a member of the Big Ten Conference. NU&#x27;s football team has won forty-six conference championships and claims five national championships, with an additional nine unclaimed. Twenty-five former Cornhuskers have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. A total of 111 former Nebraska student-athletes have combined to win fifty-four Olympic medals, including sixteen gold medals. Among approximately 300,000 Nebraska alumni are three Nobel laureates, four Pulitzer Prize winners, one Turing Award winner, and twenty-two Rhodes Scholars.

==History==

===Rise to Western prominence===
The University of Nebraska was created by an act of the Nebraska Legislature in 1869, two years after Nebraska was admitted into the Union as the thirty-seventh state. The law described the new university&#x27;s aims: &quot;The object of such institution shall be to afford to the inhabitants of the state the means of acquiring a thorough knowledge of the various branches of literature, science, and the arts.&quot; The school received an initial federal land grant of about through the Morrill Act of 1862. Public opinion on the new school was split; many argued the state did not need a university as it did not even have a state-wide high school system, and others suggested any public university should be church-controlled, which was typical of eastern colleges at the time.

Campus construction began in September 1869 when the cornerstone of University Hall was laid at the corner of 11th and S Streets. Though the building was very large, expensive, and ornate, it was made of low-quality materials and required a foundation repair before hosting a single class. By 1871, the university welcomed its inaugural class of twenty collegiate students and 110 preparatory students, and in 1873 offered its first degrees to graduating students. A school newspaper, &quot;Monthly Hesperian Student&quot; (later &quot;The Hesperian&quot;, now &quot;The Daily Nebraskan&quot;), was quickly established and the University of Nebraska State Museum (now Morrill Hall) opened in University Hall. In its early years, the University of Nebraska was modest in terms of enrollment, budget, and stature. The school&#x27;s development was slowed by a mid-1870s grasshopper swarm that devastated the state&#x27;s economy and caused NU&#x27;s first chancellor, Allen R. Benton, to resign. Benton&#x27;s successor, Edmund Burke Fairfield, led a contentious tenure highlighted by clashes over the place of religion in higher education. Under Fairfield&#x27;s watch, the University of Nebraska hired its first female faculty member, Ellen Smith (Smith Hall, built on campus in 1967 as a student residence hall, is named in her honor). Smith&#x27;s hire highlighted the young university&#x27;s relatively diverse group of students and faculty; this was done deliberately by the board of regents, which hoped to boost the school&#x27;s enrollment and the city&#x27;s population through immigration.

Like University Hall, many early buildings were poorly and cheaply constructed, and not until James Hulme Canfield became chancellor in 1891 were any significant infrastructure upgrades made. The forward-thinking, enthusiastic Canfield was a sharp contrast to the conservative, traditional leaders before him. He began an aggressive remodeling and expansion of many university buildings, often overseeing construction himself. Among these was University Library (now Architecture Hall), which was built in 1895 and is the oldest building on campus. Canfield worked to make the high school-to-college transition as easy as possible for Nebraskans and traversed the state tirelessly to encourage students from all backgrounds to consider higher education. By the time Canfield resigned in July 1895 to return to his native Ohio, enrollment had nearly quadrupled. Shortly after his departure the school established its College of Law and School of Agriculture.

The University of Nebraska&#x27;s football program played its first game in 1890, but did not have a full-time head coach until hiring Frank Crawford in 1894. Nebraska State Journal (now Lincoln Journal Star) writer Cy Sherman began referring to the team as the &quot;Cornhuskers&quot; in 1899, and the nickname was officially adopted the following year.

===A new century and The Great War===

As the twentieth century began, the university attempted to balance its identity as both a pragmatic, frontier establishment and an academic, intellectual institution. In addition to its football team, several noteworthy campus organizations were founded around this time, including a debate team, the school&#x27;s first fraternities and sororities, and the Society of Innocents (more commonly known as the Innocents Society). Much of this new growth was attributed to the hiring of Brown University president Elisha Andrews; under his guidance Nebraska became the fifth-largest public university in the United States. Andrews ambitiously sought funding for expansion; a 1904 investment from John D. Rockefeller led to the construction of The Temple, which still stands on campus. In total, nine new buildings were constructed during his tenure, including Nebraska Field, and the school nearly doubled in enrollment. Shortly after Andrews retired due to health concerns, a fierce debate ensued over whether to keep the University of Nebraska in downtown Lincoln or to move it out of town. A relocation to the outskirts of Lincoln would allow for cheaper, quicker expansion and provide farmland for the College of Agriculture. New chancellor Samuel Avery favored this relocation, believing it would make alcohol-seeking students less likely to visit downtown Lincoln or nearby Havelock (then a separate city from Lincoln). Ultimately, a statewide vote determined the university would remain in its original location, with funding prioritized for additional buildings on the Farm Campus (now East Campus).

When the United States joined World War I in April 1917, students from Nebraska&#x27;s extensive Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) program were called into service. NU&#x27;s ROTC was led by John J. Pershing during his time as a professor of military science and tactics in the 1890s; during World War I, Pershing commanded the American Expeditionary Forces and became the only person to hold the rank General of the Armies of the United States during his own lifetime. Because of his chemical expertise, Avery was asked to join the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service in Washington, D.C., and during his absence the Board of Regents conducted &quot;loyalty trials&quot; against twelve faculty members accused of anti-American sentiment (all were exonerated of criminal activity, though a few were forced to resign for conduct detrimental to the university&#x27;s reputation). Like most colleges across the United States, enrollment at NU plummeted as a result of the war. Nebraska was put in a particularly difficult position given the state and university&#x27;s reliance on agriculture, which was slow to recover in the post-war years.

Many at Nebraska wished to construct an on-campus memorial dedicated to those lost in The Great War. NU built Nebraska Field in 1909, but its wooden construction and limited seating capacity meant that after less than ten years there was significant momentum toward the building of a larger steel-and-concrete stadium. The abrupt departure of highly successful head coach Ewald O. Stiehm temporarily slowed this momentum, but by the early 1920s, with &quot;the present athletic field as inadequate now as the old one was in 1907,&quot; the university began plans to build a new stadium on the site of Nebraska Field. The new stadium project was initially conceived as a combination gymnasium-stadium-war museum complex to be called the &quot;Nebraska Soldiers and Sailors Memorial.&quot; Due to the slow post-war economy, the scope of the project was decreased to just a football stadium (though the Nebraska Coliseum was completed three years later). When the fundraising target amount of $450,000 had been met, a groundbreaking ceremony was held on April 23, 1923. Construction was completed on the 31,000-seat stadium in just over ninety days, in time for NU&#x27;s first home game of the 1923 season, a 24–0 win over Oklahoma on October 13. Memorial Stadium was dedicated the following week to honor Nebraskans who served in the American Civil War, the Spanish–American War, and World War I. Later, the dedication was expanded to honor Nebraskans who died in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.

===The Great Depression into World War II===

Avery retired in 1928 and dean of agriculture Edgar A. Burnett was named chancellor. The following year, the United States plunged into the Great Depression and the Great Plains were struck by the Dust Bowl; an agriculture-dependent state, Nebraska was hit hard in the early 1930s as crop prices fell to all-time lows. By 1932, the University of Nebraska was forced to institute a five-percent cut to maintenance and a ten-percent cut to all faculty salaries, including Burnett. A lengthy, bitter fight for funding between the Board of Regents and Nebraska Legislature lasted most of 1933, with the state initially suggesting an across-the-board budget reduction of over twenty percent, in addition to the cuts that had already been made, to prioritize funding for farmers. The Board of Regents desperately campaigned to alumni and voters for support in the budget fight and was ultimately able to negotiate a more modest set of cuts for the 1933 and 1934 fiscal years. A slight recovery in crop prices before the next round of university funding in 1935 meant the state was willing to raise NU&#x27;s budget back to what it was early in the Depression. In response to the lack of available state funds throughout the Depression, the University of Nebraska Foundation was established in 1937 to serve as the school&#x27;s primary fundraising arm.

The lack of funding, reduction in salaries, and cancellation of many university events caused a sense of general tension between administration, faculty, and students throughout most of the decade. Though he took a salary cut himself, Burnett became distrusted by the faculty, and his reputation never fully recovered. He resigned in 1938, the same year Nebraska&#x27;s student union opened on the corner of 14th and R Streets.

The Board of Regents selected West Virginia University president Chauncey Samuel Boucher to replace Burnett. The Depression was still unfolding, and in response to a rising level of failing students at the university, Boucher instituted NU&#x27;s first admission standards. At the outset of World War II in Europe, Boucher urged neutrality among students and faculty; even after the United States entered the war, he encouraged the university to &quot;carry on&quot; as normal. However, plummeting enrollment and intense national fervor meant the school could not stay &quot;neutral&quot; for long, and began offering vacant university buildings to the United States Army for training and shelter. Nebraska soon joined the Army Specialized Training Program and the campus became disorganized and chaotic as soldiers &quot;studied very casually while in residence&quot; before being deployed overseas. More than 13,000 soldiers received language, medical, or engineering training before the program was shut down in 1944 to allow for the opening of Love Library, which had been used as a barracks.

Many new classes and programs were offered throughout the 1940s, most of them in the medical and engineering fields. Following the end of the war, the school experienced an enormous influx of students, many of which were returning veterans seeking an education as part of the G.I. Bill, which offered them free tuition and housing assistance. The average soldier was older than the average college student, and thus the rate of drinking on campus (Nebraska remains a dry campus in principle to this day) increased significantly. Many older students were married with children, and the lack of adequate infrastructure on campus (specifically parking) culminated in a student riot in 1948. New chancellor Reuben Gustavson was understanding of the pranks and &quot;tomfoolery&quot; on his campus during the post-war years, and he became well-liked by the students. Gustavson was crucial to a number of post-war developments, including the integration of campus dormitories and the planning of the school&#x27;s medical center (now the University of Nebraska Medical Center).

===A new university system in transition===

By the mid-1950s, the University of Nebraska&#x27;s enrollment surpassed 18,000, nearly triple what it was before the war. New dormitories were constructed and the Nebraska Center for Continuing Education (now Hardin Hall) was established on Farm Campus to provide adequate living accommodations for the growing student body. Around this time, University of Chicago dean of agriculture Clifford M. Hardin was selected as Nebraska&#x27;s twelfth chancellor; at thirty-eight, Hardin was the youngest university president in the country. Though not an avid fan of the sport himself, Hardin prioritized the re-establishment of Nebraska as a national football power and attempted to hire high-profile head coach Duffy Daugherty from Michigan State. Daugherty declined, but suggested Hardin contact Wyoming head coach Bob Devaney. Over the next forty years, Devaney and his successor Tom Osborne created one of college football&#x27;s great dynasties, claiming five national championships between them. Hardin later said that after the Depression, he &quot;felt the state needed something to rally around.&quot;

University television network NETV (later Nebraska Educational Telecommunications, now Nebraska Public Media) was created in 1954, broadcasting over ninety hours of programming weekly. The station proved so popular, especially among rural towns, that schools and city councils raised money to purchase three new transmitters and boost the broadcast&#x27;s strength and range. The facilities for the new network were constructed on Farm Campus, which had grown considerably by the 1960s. It was home to more than just agricultural programs, including the College of Law, College of Dentistry, and Center for Hearing and Speech Disorders. To reflect this, it was renamed East Campus, given its location a mile east of the downtown campus.

By the 1950s, the Municipal University of Omaha (now the University of Nebraska Omaha) was run-down and inadequately funded, threatening the existence of the school entirely. The Nebraska Legislature, faced with the prospect of its most-populous city not having a major institute of higher learning of any kind, decided to merge the Municipal University with the larger University of Nebraska to form a state-wide university system and offer the Omaha school additional budget pools to draw from. The University of Nebraska Medical Center, located in Omaha, was separated from the Lincoln school and brought under the direction of the new state-wide system. Hardin was named the first chancellor of the University of Nebraska system in 1968 and served for two years before being named United States Secretary of Agriculture under President Richard Nixon. During his tenure, Hardin was praised among faculty for his dedication to increasing salaries and benefits, as Nebraska faculty were among the most well-compensated in the Midwest. Just as Gustavson before him, Hardin&#x27;s administration prioritized federal grant money as a way to build NU&#x27;s research profile without relying on state funding.

When Hardin took control of the state-wide system, he appointed his longtime colleague Joseph Soshnik to run what had become the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Soshnik&#x27;s tenure began in the midst of a transition for the universities of Nebraska, as well as a period of turmoil across many United States campuses as students protested American involvement in the Vietnam War. At Nebraska, this included a student takeover of the ROTC building on May 4, 1970, when a crowd of nearly two thousand protesters and onlookers gathered on campus hours after the Kent State shootings. Administration responded to protests by meeting and negotiating with student leaders, and as a result, no Vietnam War protests at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln became violent or required a National Guard intervention. Student leaders later praised Soshnik and anti-war professor Paul Olson for maintaining communication and allowing students to &quot;vent their frustrations.&quot; Minor protests were held in January 1971 when President Richard Nixon visited Lincoln to honor the school&#x27;s national championship-winning football team. Nebraska won its second consecutive national title the following year, in the process defeating archrival Oklahoma 35–31 in what was dubbed &quot;The Game of the Century&quot;.

The university completed several large-scale construction projects throughout the late 1980s. Nebraska&#x27;s student recreation accommodations were among the worst in the region, and thus a new recreation center attached to the Nebraska Coliseum was funded by the University of Nebraska Foundation; it began construction in 1987 and the third and final phase was completed in 1992. The Honors Program (later expanded to include the Raikes School of Computer Science and Management) was established, and the school&#x27;s first computer lab was completed in 1985 in the Selleck Quadrangle. The eight-million dollar Lied Center for Performing Arts finished construction in 1990.

===Modern stability and move to the Big Ten===

When longtime chancellor Martin Massengale was appointed president of the university system in 1991, the Board of Regents named Oregon State University provost Graham Spanier as his successor. Spanier quickly resolved Nebraska&#x27;s six-million dollar budget shortfall while raising admission standards. Upon the retirement of Bob Devaney as athletic director in 1992, Spanier defied the wishes of Tom Osborne and hired Bill Byrne as Devaney&#x27;s replacement. Osborne&#x27;s program, however, was incredibly successful during Spanier&#x27;s tenure, compiling a record of 45–4 and winning two national championships across four seasons. Shortly after the second of these championships, backup quarterback Brook Berringer was killed in a plane crash days before the NFL draft, where he was projected to be a mid-round pick. Berringer, a Nebraska native, endeared himself to fans when filling in for injured starter Tommie Frazier in 1994. The university erected a statue of Osborne and Berringer at Memorial Stadium. Osborne won another national championship in 1997, his third as a head coach, before retiring and naming longtime assistant Frank Solich his replacement. Spanier left in 1996 to become president of Pennsylvania State University, where he served until 2011 when he resigned following the Penn State child sex abuse scandal. Spanier was sentenced to two months in prison for his role in the scandal.

In 2008, the state of Nebraska voted to move the Nebraska State Fair from Lincoln, where it had been held since 1950, to Grand Island. The site was turned over to the university, which began construction of Nebraska Innovation Campus (NIC) in 2012. The goal was for one-third of the development to be operated by NU, with the remaining two-thirds privately rented; though initial progress was slow, the facility now has over forty full-time tenants.

Nebraska announced on June 11, 2010, it would end its affiliation with the Big 12 Conference and accept an invitation to join the Big Ten. It was the university&#x27;s first major conference transition since joining the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (later the Big Eight) in 1921. Shortly after joining the Big Ten, Nebraska constructed or significantly renovated most of its major athletic facilities. A $63.5-million overhaul of East Stadium added six thousand seats and thirty-eight luxury boxes to Memorial Stadium; the Bob Devaney Sports Center, primarily a basketball venue from its opening in 1976 until 2013, was outfitted for use by Nebraska&#x27;s volleyball program; and Pinnacle Bank Arena was constructed in downtown Lincoln.

In 2011, Nebraska was removed as a member of the Association of American Universities, an organization of research universities of which it had been a member since 1908. Nebraska ranked near the bottom of many AAU criteria due largely to the university&#x27;s extensive USDA-funded agricultural research, which was not considered by the AAU because it was not awarded by peer-reviewed grants; and because Nebraska&#x27;s medical center was a separate institution whose research funding was not under the auspices of the Lincoln campus. When the Big Ten expanded in 2010, all of its schools were members, and chancellor Harvey Perlman questioned whether Nebraska would have been invited to the conference were it not an AAU member.

During Perlman&#x27;s tenure, the school&#x27;s research expenditures reached $284 million, an all-time high, and enrollment increased by over ten percent. However, Perlman acknowledged that many fans remember him by the failures of Nebraska&#x27;s previously powerful football program, which did not win a conference title while he was chancellor. In Perlman&#x27;s sixteen years, Nebraska fired four football head coaches and two athletic directors. He retired to return to teaching at the College of Law in 2016 and Ronnie D. Green was named his successor before retiring on June 30, 2023. Rodney D. Bennett assumed the chancellorship on July 1, 2023.

==Organization and administration==
===Chancellor===

The chancellor of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln is appointed by the Board of Regents and reports to the president of the University of Nebraska system. The position was created in 1871, shortly after the school was founded. Allen R. Benton was the first chancellor and Samuel Avery was the longest-tenured. Rodney D. Bennett was named as the priority candidate for Nebraska&#x27;s twenty-first full-time chancellor on May 22, 2023 and underwent a 30-day public vetting period. The board of regents unanimously approved Bennett&#x27;s appointment on June 22, 2023, and he assumed the role on July 1, 2023.

===Student government===
The Nebraska student government was established in 1919 as the Student Council and a constitution was adopted four years later. This constitution was revised in 1965 and the Student Council became the Association of Students of the University of Nebraska (ASUN). ASUN governs over four hundred student organizations on campus.

==Colleges==

The university has nine colleges, combining to offer more than 150 undergraduate majors, twenty pre-professional programs, and one hundred graduate programs. NU offers additional programs at its campus from other University of Nebraska institutions, including the University of Nebraska Omaha College of Public Affairs and Community Service, the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Dentistry and College of Nursing, and the Peter Kiewit Institute, which is managed in partnership with the Kiewit Corporation.

College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources

The Board of Regents established the School of Agriculture in 1877 as part of the Industrial College, three years after the university was founded. Agricultural buildings were built on the outskirts of town given the lack of available farmland in downtown Lincoln, and this area came to be known as Farm Campus. The school received a boost when the Second Morrill Act was passed by the United States Congress in 1890, providing annual funds for land-grant research universities to support agricultural departments. In 1909 it was separated from the Industrial College as the College of Agriculture.

The department was renamed the College of Agriculture Sciences and Natural Resources (CASNR) in 1990. Farm Campus has since become East Campus and is no longer on the outskirts of Lincoln as the area around it has developed, but is still home to most CASNR buildings. The college maintains rural facilities across the state of Nebraska for research purposes. It offers one of eighteen PGA Golf Management degree programs in the United States.

The College is a component of the University&#x27;s Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources (IANR), as are the Agricultural Research Division (ARD), Nebraska Extension, and the ARD and Extension components of three departments in the College of Education and Human Sciences. The IANR&#x27;s research, teaching, and extension education encompass the fields of food production, environmental stewardship, human nutrition, business development, and youth engagement.

College of Architecture

Nebraska offered its first architecture course in 1894 and established the Department of Architecture in 1930. The department did not become the College of Agriculture until 1973, by which time the University Library, the oldest building on campus, had become Architecture Hall. In 1987, Architecture Hall was connected to the former Law College building, significantly expanding the space available to the college.

College of Arts and Sciences

The College of Arts and Sciences, established with the university itself in 1869, is the oldest college at Nebraska. It is also the largest, offering sixty degree programs to over five thousand undergraduate students.

College of Business

Nebraska&#x27;s school of commerce was founded in 1913 and became the College of Business Administration in 1919. The college was one of seventeen charter members of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business in 1916 and has since received accreditation in accounting as well. It is one of thirty-six United States business schools affiliated with the CFA Institute. In 2017, the College of Business opened Howard L. Hawks Hall, an $84 million, 240,000-square-foot facility named in honor of Omaha businessman and former NU Regent Howard Hawks. With over four thousand undergraduate students, it is NU&#x27;s second-largest college.

College of Education and Human Sciences

The College of Education and Human Sciences (CEHS) was established in 2003 when the College of Human Resources and Family Sciences was merged with Teachers College. The department offers a degree in Textile History and operates the International Quilt Museum on East Campus, which houses the largest public collection of quilts in the world. In 2020, Mabel Lee Hall was demolished to clear the site for the construction of Carolyn Pope Edwards Hall; upon its completion, scheduled prior to the 2022–23 academic year, the new building will house CEHS.

College of Engineering

The Industrial College was founded in 1872 and began offering engineering classes in 1877. In 1909, it was split into the College of Engineering and the College of Agriculture. The Mechanical Arts Building (later Stout Hall) was completed in 1898 and served as the College of Engineering&#x27;s primary home for nearly eighty years. What became Nebraska Hall was purchased from the Elgin National Watch Company in 1958 and NU relocated most of its engineering programs there in 1971. The college absorbed the engineering department from the University of Nebraska Omaha in 1970; though the Omaha campus has its own facilities, its degree programs, faculty, and funding come from Lincoln and its students are considered part of the Lincoln university. In 2019, the college began a $170-million expansion and remodel of most of its Lincoln facilities.

In conjunction with the Kiewit Corporation, the College of Engineering runs the Peter Kiewit Institute (PKI) in Omaha. PKI houses the original Holland Computing Center, which opened a second location in Lincoln in 2007. The college also operates the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility, which researches highway design and safety and in 2002 created the SAFER barrier for use on high-speed racetracks.

Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts

The College of Fine and Performing Arts was established in 1993 upon the completion of the Lied Center for Performing Arts. The center, and later the college, are named for donor Christina Hixson and the Lied Foundation Trust.

College of Journalism and Mass Communications

Will Owen Jones, later the editor of the Nebraska State Journal (now Lincoln Journal Star), taught Nebraska&#x27;s first journalism class in 1894. A School of Journalism was created three decades later. When the university founded NETV (now Nebraska Public Media) in 1954 and KRNU in 1970, the journalism college offered broadcasting classes for opportunities in both television and radio. The college is one of six journalism schools in the United States that participates in the Dow Jones News Fund editing internship program and one of eleven selected for the Carnegie-Knight Initiative on the Future of Journalism Education. Though &quot;The Daily Nebraskan&quot; and &quot;The DailyER&quot; are independent of the College of Journalism and Mass Communications, most of the papers&#x27; writers are journalism students.

College of Law

The Central Law College was founded as a private entity in 1888 and integrated into the University of Nebraska three years later as the Law College (now the College of Law). Roscoe Pound, one of the foremost proponents of legal realism in the United States and later the dean of Harvard Law School, led the department from 1903 to 1907. It was one of twenty-five charter members of the Association of American Law Schools and is accredited by the American Bar Association.

Graduate College

The University of Nebraska Graduate College is a school-wide program, with the same dean and administration supporting each department.

==Campus==
The University of Nebraska–Lincoln operates three campuses, which are laid out over a combined .

===City Campus===

The original University of Nebraska campus was laid out on four city blocks in the northeast corner of the planned downtown Lincoln area, and for fifteen years comprised just one building, the four-story University Hall. The university used its last available allotment of original land to construct the Law College Building in 1911. The first expansion of what became known as City Campus occurred in 1908, when the school acquired land to the west to construct Nebraska Field. Further development of the surrounding area meant that Memorial Stadium, constructed on the site in 1923, had to be oriented east-to-west instead of north-to-south as Nebraska Field was. As enrollment increased following World War II, the university purchased lands owned by the Missouri Pacific Railroad to construct high-rise dormitories.

City Campus is home to the Lied Center for Performing Arts, a performing arts venue used primarily for orchestra concerts and theatre performances. The nearby Mary Riepma Ross Media Arts Center is a two-screen theater featuring primarily arthouse, independent, and documentary films. Since 1928, City Campus has been the headquarters of the National Society of Pershing Rifles, a military fraternal organization for college-level students. John J. Pershing, an 1893 law school graduate and professor of Military Science and Tactics, created &quot;Company A,&quot; a competitive drill team, for the University of Nebraska&#x27;s Cadet Corps in 1891. The team won the National Competitive Drills in 1892 and soon changed its name to the &quot;Pershing Rifles&quot; in honor of Pershing. The Mueller Tower, built in 1949, stands near the Pershing Rifles headquarters on 14th Street.

The school&#x27;s first student union, called simply the Student Union (now the Nebraska Union), was constructed in 1938 on the corner of 14th and R Streets. It underwent extensive renovation and expansion in 1958, 1969, and 1999; a further $40-million project approved in 2019 was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Nebraska Union houses the University Bookstore and offices for &quot;The Daily Nebraskan&quot; and &quot;The DailyER&quot;, the Association of Students of the University of Nebraska, Greek life, and the Jackie Gaughan Multicultural Center.

===East Campus===

As much of the land originally allocated to the school was unsuitable for farming, 320 acres to the east of campus was purchased in 1874. Termed Farm Campus (commonly referred to as &quot;The Farm&quot;), it became home to many of Nebraska&#x27;s agricultural programs. At the beginning of the twentieth century, there was considerable discussion to move the entire university to Farm Campus to allow for greater expansion, and the idea was supported by faculty who felt the &quot;wholesome environment&quot; may be &quot;more conducive to academic pursuits.&quot; Ultimately, a state-wide vote approved the purchase of new lands for City Campus. Farm Campus was renamed East Campus in 1964 to reflect its development past a purely agricultural development. East Campus is heavily landscaped, with the grounds functioning as a research mission of the university; they are administered as the Botanical Garden and Arboretum, which handles major plantings at both Cather Garden and Maxwell Arboretum. The headquarters of Nebraska Public Media are located on East Campus, where it was established in 1954 as NETV.

Almost immediately after the Nebraska Union opened on City Campus, there was momentum among agricultural students to do the same on Farm Campus. A temporary union was established in 1947, with a performance from student Johnny Carson at its grand opening, but a permanent building was not constructed until thirty years later. A $28.5-million renovation of the Nebraska East Union was completed in 2021. The Nebraska East Union is home to the Loft Gallery, used for community and student artwork, as well as a full-size bowling alley that is the home venue and practice facility for Nebraska&#x27;s bowling team.

===Nebraska Innovation Campus===

The University of Nebraska–Lincoln&#x27;s third campus, Nebraska Innovation Campus, was established in 2014 on the former site of the Nebraska State Fair grounds, just northeast of City Campus. Plans for redevelopment included an $800-million expansion to house agricultural biotechnology and other life science research. Several historic structures formerly used for the state fair were repurposed and modernized for university use. Bordered by several athletic facilities which are technically a part of City Campus, Innovation Campus serves as a research hub for over forty public and private enterprises. As many developments are privately owned or rented, it is the only NU campus which allows alcohol. The $35-million Scarlet Hotel was opened on Innovation Campus in 2022.

==Academics==

=== Undergraduate admissions ===
Admission to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln is rated &quot;more selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Among 17,775 first-year applicants for the 2021–22 academic year, Eighty-eight percent (15,701) were admitted and twenty-seven percent (4,736) enrolled. Among 2,654 transfer applicants for the 2021–22 academic year, sixty-three percent (1,675) were admitted and twenty-sixpercent (685) enrolled.

Of the 85% of enrolled freshmen in 2021 who submitted ACT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite score was between 22 and 28. Of the 8% of the incoming freshman class who submitted SAT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite scores were 1100-1310.

The University of Nebraska–Lincoln is a college-sponsor of the National Merit Scholarship Program and sponsored 37 Merit Scholarship awards in 2020. In the 2020–2021 academic year, 43 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.

===Libraries===
The university dedicated University Library (now Architecture Hall) on December 10, 1895. Initially, only one of the building&#x27;s four stories housed library collections, but less than twenty years after its opening the entire facility was needed. An $850,000 gift from former Lincoln mayor Don Lathrop Love facilitated the construction of Don L. Love Memorial Library, completed in 1943. The new building was initially used to house cadets in the Army Specialized Training Program during World War II before opening for university use in 1945. A significant expansion on the north side of the building was completed in 1972 and became known as Love Library North. The $10-million, 30,000-square-foot Adele Coryell Hall Learning Commons were opened in 2016 on the first floor of Love Library North.

The C. Y. Thompson Library was dedicated in 1966 on East Campus as the university&#x27;s first standalone branch library; it was renamed the Dinsdale Family Learning Commons in 2022 following a significant remodel and serves the Colleges of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Dentistry, and Special Education and Communication Disorders. There are six other branch locations on campus: the Architecture Library, Engineering Library, Geology Library, Marvin and Virginia Schmid Law Library, Mathematics Library, and Music Library. The university&#x27;s libraries combine to offer nearly four million volumes and are the only set of comprehensive research libraries in Nebraska.

===Museums and galleries===

Originally established in 1871, the University of Nebraska State Museum is located in Morrill Hall on City Campus. It houses collections and exhibits featuring natural history, including its most popular attraction, a set of Mammoth fossils. Because of these fossils and a bronze Columbian mammoth statue in front of the building named Archie, it is popularly known as &quot;Elephant Hall.&quot; The State Museum is a member of the American Alliance of Museums and a Smithsonian affiliate.

The Sheldon Museum of Art is home to more than twelve thousand works of American visual art in all media. It has prominent holdings in nineteenth-century landscape and still life, American Impressionism, early modernism, and contemporary art. The museum has the largest collection of twentieth-century North American art in the world and houses works by artists Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock, and Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe. The nearby Great Plains Art Museum is home to the Christlieb Collection and features American western art and Americana.

The International Quilt Museum, home to the largest public collection of quilts in the world, is located in the southwest corner of East Campus. The Lester F. Larsen Tractor Museum, established on East Campus in 1980, houses forty historical tractors, an antique auto, and various farm tools. Along with the Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory, it documents Nebraska&#x27;s tractor testing law examination that tests all tractors sold in the state to ensure performance meets advertised specifications. The Robert Hillestad Textiles Gallery, also on East Campus, features exhibitions of historic and contemporary textiles and clothing.

Other university art galleries include the Eisentrager-Howard Gallery, the Kruger Collection, and the student-run MEDICI Gallery in Richards Hall. The Lentz Center for Asian Culture is no longer open to the public, though its collection of Asian ceramics, paintings, prints, sculpture, and textiles has been digitized for online viewing.

==Athletics==
The Nebraska Cornhuskers (often abbreviated to Huskers) are the intercollegiate athletic teams that represent the university. NU is a member of the Big Ten Conference and competes in NCAA Division I, fielding twenty-four varsity teams (ten men&#x27;s, fourteen women&#x27;s) in fifteen sports. Nineteen of these teams participate in the Big Ten, while rifle is a member of the single-sport Patriot Rifle Conference and beach volleyball and bowling compete as independents. The Cornhuskers have two official mascots, Herbie Husker and Lil&#x27; Red.

Early nicknames for the university&#x27;s athletic teams included &quot;Antelopes&quot; (later adopted by the University of Nebraska at Kearney), &quot;Old Gold Knights&quot;, and &quot;Bugeaters&quot;. &quot;Cornhuskers&quot; first appeared in a school newspaper headline (&quot;We Have Met The Cornhuskers And They Are Ours&quot;) after an 1893 victory over Iowa, though in this instance the term referred to Iowa. It was first applied to Nebraska in 1899 by Nebraska State Journal writer Cy Sherman and was officially adopted by the school the following year – and later by the state of Nebraska itself, which became &quot;The Cornhusker State&quot; in 1945.

Nebraska was a founding member of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1907 (later known as the Big Six, Big Seven, and Big Eight Conference) and competed in it for the next eighty-nine years, with a brief hiatus during World War I. In 1996, NU and the seven other members of the Big Eight merged with four Texas schools from the Southwest Conference to form the Big 12 Conference. Nebraska joined the Big Ten in 2011.

===Football===
Nebraska&#x27;s football team competes in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. NU has played its home games at Memorial Stadium since 1923 and sold out every game at the venue since 1962.

Nebraska is among the most storied programs in college football history and has won forty-six conference championships and five national titles (along with seven others the school does not claim). The program&#x27;s first extended period of success came just after the turn of the twentieth century. Between 1900 and 1916, Nebraska had five undefeated seasons and completed a stretch of thirty-four games without a loss, still a program record. Despite a span of twenty-one conference championships in thirty-three seasons, the Cornhuskers did not experience major national success until Bob Devaney was hired in 1962. Devaney won two national championships and eight conference titles in eleven seasons as head coach, but perhaps his most lasting achievement was the hiring of Tom Osborne as offensive coordinator in 1969. Osborne was named Devaney&#x27;s successor in 1973 and over the next twenty-five years established himself as one of the best coaches in college football history with his trademark I-formation offense and revolutionary strength, conditioning, and nutrition programs. Following Osborne&#x27;s retirement in 1997, Nebraska cycled through five head coaches before hiring Matt Rhule in 2022.

==Student life==

===Student body===

Seventy-six percent of NU&#x27;s undergraduates were classified as &quot;white, non-Hispanic,&quot; 8.3 percent were Hispanic or Latino, 3.6 percent were Asian, 2.8 percent were black or African-American, and less than one percent were American Indian, native Alaskan, native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander. Fifty-one percent of the undergraduate population was male and forty-nine percent was female.

At the outset of the 2021–22 academic year NU had 1,595 instructional faculty, of which 1,304 were full-time. Fifty-eight percent (919) were male and forty-two percent (676) were female. The school&#x27;s student-to-faculty ratio was sixteen-to-one. Sixty-nine percent of NU&#x27;s students are from Nebraska; the remaining thirty-one percent is made up of students from all forty-nine other states and 114 countries.

Sixty-eight percent of undergraduate students received grants and thirty-nine percent received federal loans.

===Residence halls===

On-campus students are members of the Residence Hall Association, which serves as the governing body for dormitory living. Approximately forty percent of the student body lives on-campus throughout traditional residence halls, apartment-style halls, and suite-style halls. There are seven traditional residence halls on City Campus: Abel, Harper, Kauffman Academic Residential Center, Sandoz, Schramm, Selleck Quadrangle, and Smith. City Campus has two apartment-style halls (The Courtyards and The Village) and three suite-style halls (Eastside Suites, Knoll Residential Center, and University Suites). East Campus is home to the Massengale Residential Center, which contains both traditional and apartment-style housing, and Love Memorial Hall, an all-female cooperative facility.

Though many Greek houses opened in the 1920s, the first university-operated dormitory was not completed until the female-only Raymond Hall (now Neihardt Residential Hall, though it is not in use) was dedicated in 1932. Nebraska opened what was initially a male-only facility, the Selleck Quadrangle, in 1954, and constructed Cather and Pound Halls in 1963 to house a rapidly expanding student body. Just a few years later it opened Abel and Sandoz Halls, still the largest residency complex on campus. By the 2000s, Cather and Pound Halls were out-of-date and the university began plans to renovate or remove the buildings. After a 2014 study determined it would cost $22.7 million to bring the facility up to code, and millions more to complete a modern renovation, Cather and Pound Halls were imploded on December 22, 2017.

===Greek life===
Nebraska has a significant Greek population, with about 5,200 students in twenty-seven fraternities (twenty-five chapters and two colonies) and sixteen sororities. In the 2021–22 academic year, twenty-one percent of freshman males joined fraternities and twenty-six percent of freshman females joined sororities. The school&#x27;s earliest surviving fraternity (Sigma Chi) was established in January 1883; Kappa Kappa Gamma became its first sorority the following year. By 1900 the campus had eleven fraternities and five sororities, and Nebraska established the Intrafraternity Council and Intrasorority Council to govern Greek life on campus.

The Society of Innocents (more commonly known as the Innocents Society) was founded in 1903 as an all-male pep group that led student rallies before football games. It is named after the thirteen popes named Innocent and each year inducts thirteen seniors (now male and female) based on academic achievement and leadership qualities. Historically, the organization has inducted new members by tackling them in a secret ceremony. A similar all-female organization, the Black Masque chapter of Mortar Board, was created in 1918.

===Media===

&quot;The Daily Nebraskan&quot; (often referred to as &quot;The D. N.&quot;) is Nebraska&#x27;s student newspaper. It was established in 1871 as the &quot;Monthly Hesperian Student&quot; and was published every weekday during the fall and spring semesters and weekly during the summer until 2017, when students voted to reduce the paper&#x27;s funding. The paper now operates mainly online, publishing only a monthly print copy. Novelist Willa Cather served as managing editor of the paper from 1892 to 1895. Though many of its writers are students in the College of Journalism and Mass Communications, &quot;The Daily Nebraskan&quot; is independent of the college.

In February 2008, the Publications Board recognized &quot;The DailyER&quot; as an affiliated publication and approved the printing costs of the first three issues of the satirical paper. The paper is published monthly during the fall and spring semesters. Despite its similarity in name, &quot;The DailyER&quot; is not affiliated with &quot;The Daily Nebraskan&quot;.

The university established NETV (later Nebraska Educational Telecommunications, now Nebraska Public Media) in 1954 on what was then Farm Campus. Initially a television station broadcasting ninety hours of local programming per week to a thirty-mile radius, the network has expanded to service all of Nebraska and is a member of the Public Broadcasting Service, while its radio stations (established in 1989) are members of National Public Radio. The school operates a Class A FM radio station, KRNU, which broadcasts on 90.3 FM over approximately twenty miles.

==Notable people==


Since honoring its first graduating class in 1873, the University of Nebraska–Lincoln has issued over 300,000 degrees. Among these graduates are three Nobel laureates, four Pulitzer Prize winners, one Turing Award winner, twenty-two Rhodes Scholars, fifteen state governors, and twenty-three College Football Hall of Famers. Fifteen alumni have been selected as Truman Scholars and in 2010 Nebraska was named a Truman Scholarship Honor Institution.

<doc id="323063" wikidata="Q378786" url="?curid=323063" title="The God of Small Things">
<text>The God of Small Things is a family drama novel written by Indian writer Arundhati Roy. It is a story about the childhood experiences of fraternal twins whose lives are destroyed by the &quot;Love Laws&quot; prevalent in the 1960s Kerala, India. The novel explores how small, seemingly insignificant occurrences, decisions and experiences shape people&#x27;s behavior in deeply significant ways. The novel also explores the lingering effects of casteism in India, lending a culturally specific critique of British colonialism in India. It won the Booker Prize in 1997.

&quot;The God of Small Things&quot; was Roy&#x27;s debut novel, published in 1997. It was followed by the 2017 publication &quot;The Ministry of Utmost Happiness&quot; twenty years later. Roy began writing the manuscript for &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; in 1992 and finished four years later, in 1996, leading to its publication the following year. The potential of the story was first recognized by HarperCollins editor Pankaj Mishra, who sent it to three British publishers. Roy received a £500,000 advance, and rights to the book were sold in 21 countries.

==Background==
===Inspiration===
Arundhati Roy, after being involved with making films and writing screenplays, popularly &quot;In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones&quot; and &quot;Electric Moon&quot;, &quot;wanted to do something where I didn&#x27;t have to deal with people; I wanted to do something alone.&quot; She bought a computer and soon figured out how to use it. She noted she didn&#x27;t know she was writing a novel. Roy took inspiration from her childhood experiences in Aymanam, a village in the Kottayam district of Kerala, India, where she led an unprotected child&#x27;s life. Being an &quot;adult child&quot;, Roy observed and remembered what she sensed in the village and &quot;said everything I wanted to say at that point of time&quot; through writing the novel. 

===Writing===
Roy began writing her first novel on her computer in 1992 in New Delhi, though the first few months she &quot;was just fooling around before I realized what was happening and got down to writing the book properly&quot; and completed it in 1996. Without a plan, she enjoyed that her writing &quot;kept surprising&quot; her and was unsure if she would ever finish it. She didn&#x27;t tell to her friends or her husband Pradip Krishen about her writing, &quot;afraid she would talk the tale out&quot;. Krishen adored when she showed him her final draft. She &quot;wrote it out of sequence. I didn&#x27;t start with the first chapter or end with the last chapter. I actually started writing with a single image in my head: the sky blue Plymouth with two twins inside it, a Marxist procession surrounding it. And it just developed from there. The language just started weaving together, sentence by sentence.&quot; 

Roy stated that she never re-wrote a written sentence in the novel and that arranging the plot took time &quot;but was never painful.&quot; Roy said that the novel is semi-autobiographical. For instance, she modelled some of her characters from those she knew, like her mother Mary Roy&#x27;s father P.V. Issac as Pappachi, her brother George Issac as Chacko, his ex-wife Cecilia Philipson as Margaret Kochamma just to say a few. Roy&#x27;s mother confirmed she was very similar to the character Ammu, however, she was never involved with a man of lower caste, as was the case in the book is another instance.

Training as an architect influenced her writing. One day, she &quot;woke up and sketched the plot graphically with a series of drawings. That&#x27;s when I understood what I was getting at.&quot; Writing the novel was &quot;about design&quot; and &quot;like architecture&quot; for her. She told &quot;Salon&quot; in 1997: 

===Title===
The title of the novel was conceived at &quot;the very last minute&quot; while printing out the manuscript. Speaking to &quot;HarperCollins&quot;, she said: &quot;One of the chapters was called The God of Small Things, I don&#x27;t know how that happened, ... When I read the book now I can&#x27;t believe the amount of references there are to small things, but it was absolutely not the case that I started with the title and built the novel around it.&quot;

==Plot==
The story is set in Ayemenem, Kerala, with a disjointed narrative shifting between 1969 and 1993. Rahel and Estha, fraternal twins, reunite in 1993. Ammu Ipe, their mother, marries Baba to escape her father and returns to Ayemenem after leaving her abusive husband. Chacko, Ammu&#x27;s brother, returns from England after his divorce. The family home includes Baby Kochamma, Pappachi&#x27;s sister, who remained unmarried due to unrequited love. She manipulates events to cause misfortune.

The death of Margaret&#x27;s second husband in a car accident prompts Chacko to invite her and their daughter, Sophie, to spend Christmas in Ayemenem. On the road to the airport, the family encounters a group of Communist protesters who surround the car and humiliate Baby Kochamma. Rahel thinks she sees amongst the protesters Velutha, an Untouchable servant who works for the family&#x27;s pickle factory. Later at the theater, Estha is sexually molested by the &quot;Orangedrink Lemondrink Man&quot;, a vendor working at the snack counter. Rahel&#x27;s claim of seeing Velutha in the Communist mob leads Baby Kochamma to associate him with her humiliation. Rahel and Estha develop a bond with Velutha, while Ammu is drawn to him, sparking a forbidden romance. Velutha is depicted as sympathetic but faces tragedy due to his caste and relationship with Ammu. When Velutha&#x27;s father exposes their affair, Ammu is locked up, and Velutha is banished. Ammu blames the twins for her plight, leading them to flee with their cousin Sophie. Their boat capsizes and Sophie drowns; Margaret and Chacko return to find Sophie dead on the sofa.

Baby Kochamma accuses Velutha of Sophie&#x27;s death, leading to his brutal beating and arrest by the police. The twins witness this traumatic event. The chief of police, aware of Velutha&#x27;s Communist ties, fears unrest if the wrongful arrest is exposed. He threatens Baby Kochamma for falsely accusing Velutha. To save herself, Baby Kochamma manipulates Estha and Rahel into implicating Velutha in Sophie&#x27;s murder. Velutha dies from his injuries. Despite Ammu&#x27;s attempts to tell the truth, Baby Kochamma convinces Chacko that Ammu and the twins are responsible for Sophie&#x27;s death. Chacko ejects Ammu from the house, separating Estha from her forever. Ammu dies alone in a motel at 31. Rahel moves to America to attend university but returns to Ayemenem after a tumultuous life. She reunites with Estha, who has lived a solitary, mute existence with Baby Kochamma. They have sex. Despite their reunion, their lives remain sorrowful. The novel concludes with a reflection on Ammu&#x27;s and Velutha&#x27;s love affair.

==Characters==

=== Major Characters ===

He witnessed Velutha&#x27;s illicit affair with Ammu and reveals it to Mammachi and he even offers to kill his own son, but Mammachi sends him away.

==Techniques==
Roy uses various techniques to represent the children&#x27;s viewpoints and their innocence. One technique she employs is the capitalization of certain words and phrases to give them significance (for example, &quot;Because Anything Can Happen To Anyone&quot;). The children also restate things that adults say in a phonetic way, separating and recombining words. This echoes the children&#x27;s way of looking at the world, distinct from the perspective of the grown-ups who surround them. Roy often uses metaphors that feature elements that are more prominent in the lives of children, such as toothpaste, secrets, or portable pianos. They place significance on words and ideas differently from the adults, thereby creating a new way of viewing the world around them. They pick up on certain feelings and ideas that the adults around them either fail or refuse to recognize, and give new significance to things that the adults ignore for their own purposes. 

The children use and repeat these phrases throughout the story so that the phrases themselves gain independence and representational meanings. When writing, Roy said, &quot;Repetition I love, and used because it made me feel safe. Repeated words and phrases have a rocking feeling, like a lullaby. They help take away the shock of the plot -- death, lives destroyed or the horror of the settings -- a crazy, chaotic, emotional house, the sinister movie theater.&quot;

Another way she plays with language is to join words together without punctuation, which we see in the description of the &#x27;Orangedrink Lemondrink man&#x27; or &#x27;bluegreyblue eyes&#x27;. This subversion of the usual rules of syntax and grammar not only places us in a child&#x27;s view of the world, but it also draws attention to the role of language in colonialism. By corrupting standard use of English (the colonial language of India) Roy is rebelling against colonial influence still present in India, represented by characters such as Margaret Kochamma and Chacko who always speak correctly.

Roy also employs a disjointed, non-sequential narrative style that echoes the process of memory, especially the resurfacing of a previously suppressed, painful memory. The story of three different generations is told simultaneously going back and forth in time.

The uncovering of the story of Sophie&#x27;s death, concurrently with the forward-moving story of Rahel&#x27;s return to Ayemenem and reunion with Estha, creates a complex narrative that emphasizes the difficulty of the subject of the story and the complexity of the culture from which the story originates. Time is rendered somewhat static as parts of one narrative line are intertwined through repetition and non-sequential discovery. This is also part of the way Roy uses real-life places and people that she has shifted and altered for use in the story. The story&#x27;s many elements come together to construct a diverse look at one instance of Indian culture and the effect of the caste system on life and love during a time of post-colonialism. As the children try to form their own identities, naming and renaming themselves in the process, Roy places in parallel the effect of the process by intertwining the past and the present.

This process also echoes the progression of the Indian people, like that of all cultures that try to find ways to maintain their traditions in a time of increasing globalization.

== Possible autobiographical elements ==
&quot;The God of Small Things&quot; is a work of fiction but some critics have tried to find autobiographical parallels in the novel, while at the same time warning against drawing any simplistic connections between the novel and the writer&#x27;s life. Some of the similarities between Roy&#x27;s life and that of the characters she creates include her own Syrian Christian and Hindu lineage; the divorce of her parents when she and her brother were very young; her return to the family home in Ayemenem after her mother&#x27;s divorce; and her education in an architectural school, to name a few. Some critics also attribute the political awareness manifested in &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; to Roy&#x27;s early life-influences from her mother, who was an activist and feminist.

==Reception==
&quot;The God of Small Things&quot; received stellar reviews in major American newspapers such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; (a &quot;dazzling first novel&quot;, &quot;extraordinary&quot;, &quot;at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple&quot;) and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; (&quot;a novel of poignancy and considerable sweep&quot;), and in Canadian publications such as the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; (&quot;a lush, magical novel&quot;). &quot;Time&quot; named it one of the best books of the year. Critical response in the United Kingdom was less positive, and the awarding of the Booker Prize caused controversy; Carmen Callil, a 1996 Booker Prize judge, called the novel &quot;execrable&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the contest as &quot;profoundly depressing&quot;. In India, the book was criticised especially for its unrestrained description of sexuality. E. K. Nayanar, then Chief Minister of Roy&#x27;s home state Kerala, voiced criticism about the book&#x27;s depiction of women and sex, and she had to answer charges of obscenity. Some critics have pointed out that the reader reviews of this book on bookseller websites are so extremely opposed at times that it is difficult to imagine readers are talking about the same book.

The book has since been translated into Malayalam by Priya A. S., under the title &quot;Kunju Karyangalude Odeythampuran&quot; (). 
In 2014, the novel was ranked in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as one of the 10 all-time greatest Asian novels. On 5 November 2019, the BBC News listed &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels. Emma Lee-Potter of &quot;The Independent&quot; listed it as one of the 12 best Indian novels.

In 2022, the novel was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

==In popular culture==
In 2013, &quot;Talkhiyaan&quot;, a Pakistani television series based on the novel, was aired on Express Entertainment.

The band Darlingside credits the novel as the inspiration for their song &quot;The God of Loss&quot;.

<text>This is a list of [[river]]s and [[creek (waterway)|creeks]] located on the island of [[Prince Edward Island]].

Despite the fact that many are called &quot;rivers&quot;, their freshwater portions are not large enough to warrant this name. These watercourses are more correctly categorized as [[streams]], with the majority of their length being tidal inlets or estuaries where the small amount of fresh water interchanges with salt water from the Gulf of St. Lawrence or Northumberland Strait.

<doc id="323068" wikidata="Q27102" url="?curid=323068" title="Razorbill">
<text>The razorbill (Alca torda) is a North Atlantic colonial seabird and the only extant member of the genus &quot;Alca&quot; of the family Alcidae, the auks. It is the closest living relative of the extinct great auk (&quot;Pinguinus impennis&quot;). Historically, it has also been known as &quot;auk&quot;, &quot;razor-billed auk&quot; and &quot;lesser auk&quot;.

Razorbills are primarily black with a white underside. The male and female are identical in plumage; however, males are generally larger than females. This agile bird, which is capable of both flight and diving, has a predominantly aquatic lifestyle and only comes to land in order to breed. It is monogamous, choosing one partner for life. Females lay one egg per year. Razorbills nest along coastal cliffs in enclosed or slightly exposed crevices. The parents spend equal amounts of time incubating, and once the chick has hatched, they take turns foraging for their young.

Presently, this species faces major threats, including the destruction of breeding sites, oil spills, and deterioration of food quality. The IUCN records the population of the species as fluctuating, causing its status to interchange. It has been recorded that the population had increased from 2008 to 2015, decreased from 2015 to 2021, and appears to be increasing or stable at the present. It is estimated that the current global razorbill population lies between 838,000 and 1,600,000 individuals. In 1918, the razorbill was protected in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. 

== Taxonomy ==

The genus &quot;Alca&quot; was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name &quot;Alca&quot; is from Norwegian &quot;Alke&quot;, and &quot;torda&quot; is from &quot;törd&quot; a Gotland Swedish dialect word; both terms refer to this species. The type locality is Stora Karlsö, just off the west coast of Gotland, Sweden. The word &quot;Alca&quot; had been used for the razorbill by earlier authors such as Carolus Clusius in 1605 and Francis Willughby in 1676.

The razorbill (&quot;Alca torda&quot;) is now the sole species in the genus &quot;Alca&quot;, though its close relative, the great auk (&quot;Pinguinus impennis&quot;), which became extinct in the mid-19th century, was also formerly included in the genus &quot;Alca&quot;. Razorbills and great auks are part of the tribe Alcini, which also includes the common murre or common guillemot (&quot;Uria aalge&quot;), the thick-billed murre or Brünnich&#x27;s guillemot (&quot;Uria lomvia&quot;), and the little auk (&quot;Alle alle&quot;).

There are two subspecies of razorbill accepted by the IOC:

The two subspecies differ slightly in size and bill measurements, with &quot;A. t. islandica&quot;, which occurs in warmer waters, being slightly smaller. A third subspecies &quot;Alca torda pica&quot; Linnaeus, 1766 (originally described as a species &quot;Alca pica&quot; from the Arctic, and reduced to subspecies by Salomonsen in 1944), is no longer accepted because the distinguishing characteristic, an additional furrow in the upper mandible, is now known to be age-related.

==Description==

The razorbill has a white belly and a black head, neck, back, and feet during the breeding season. A thin white line also extends from the eyes to the end of the bill. Its head is darker than that of a common murre. During the non-breeding season, the throat and face behind the eye become white, and the white line on the face and bill becomes less prominent. The bill is black, deep and laterally compressed, with a blunt end. It has several vertical grooves or furrows near the curved tip, one of them adorned with a white, broken vertical line. The bill is thinner and the grooves are less marked during the non-breeding season. It is a large and thick-set bird for an alcid, and its mean weight ranges from . The female and male adults are very much alike, having only small differences such as wing length. It is 37–39 cm in body length, the wing length of adult males ranges from while that of females ranges from . During incubation, this species has a horizontal stance and the tail feathers are slightly longer in the center in comparison to other alcids. This makes the razorbill have a distinctly long tail which is not common for an auk. In-flight, the feet do not protrude beyond the tail.

Their mating system is female-enforced monogamy; the razorbill pairs for life. It nests in open or hidden crevices among cliffs and boulders. It is a colonial breeder and only comes to land to breed. The annual survival rate of the razorbill is between 89 and 95%. Though the razorbill&#x27;s average lifespan is roughly 13 years, a bird ringed in the UK in 1967 survived for at least 41 years—a record for the species.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Razorbills are distributed across the North Atlantic; the world population of razorbills is estimated to be at less than 1,000,000 breeding pairs (Chapdelaine &quot;et al.&quot; 2001). Approximately half of the breeding pairs occur in Iceland. Razorbills thrive at water surface temperatures below 15 °C. They are often seen with the two larger auks, thick-billed murre and common murre. However, unlike other auks, they commonly move into larger estuaries with lower salinity levels to feed. These birds are distributed across sub-arctic and boreal waters of the Atlantic. Their breeding habitat is islands, rocky shores, and cliffs on northern Atlantic coasts, in eastern North America as far south as Maine, and in western Europe from northwestern Russia to northern France. North American birds migrate offshore and south, ranging from the Labrador Sea south to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to New England. Eurasian birds also winter at sea, with multiple populations aggregating in the North Sea and some moving south as far as the western Mediterranean. Approximately 60 to 70% of the entire razorbill population breeds in Iceland.

Some razorbill colonies include (north to south):

* Grímsey, Iceland (66°33&#x27; N)
* Látrabjarg, Iceland (65°30&#x27; N) - 230,000 pairs, about 40% of the global population (mid-1990s estimate). Breeding season June – July.
* Runde, Norway (62°24&#x27; N) - 3,000 pairs.
* St Kilda, Scotland (57°49&#x27; N).

== Behaviour ==

The life-history traits of the razorbill are similar to that of the common murre. However, razorbills are slightly more agile. In North America it is a largely migratory seabird, as during the colder months, it leaves land and spends the entire winter in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, though western European birds often remain close to their breeding sites.

During breeding, both males and females protect the nest. Females select their mate and will often encourage competition between males before choosing a partner. Once a male is chosen, the pair will stay together for life.

=== Reproduction ===
Individuals only breed at 3–5 years old. As pairs grow older they will occasionally skip a year of breeding. A mating pair will court several times during breeding periods to strengthen their bond. Courtship displays include touching bills and following one another in elaborate flight patterns. Once the pre-laying period begins, males will constantly guard their mates by knocking other males away with their bills. The pair will mate up to 80 times in a 30-day period to ensure fertilisation. Females will sometimes encourage other males to engage in copulation to guarantee successful fecundity.

Throughout the pre-laying period, razorbills will gather in large numbers. Two types of social behaviour occur; large groups dive and swim together in circles repeatedly and all rise up to the surface, heads first and bills open; secondly, large groups swim in a line weaving across each other in the same direction.

=== Nest sites ===

Nest site choice is very important for these birds to ensure the protection of the young from predators. Unlike murres, nest sites are not immediately alongside the sea on open cliff ledges but at least away, in crevices on cliffs or among boulders. Nests are usually confined among the rocks or slightly more open. Some sites are along ledges, however, crevice sites seem to be more successful due to reduced predation.

The mating pair will often reuse the same site every year. Since chicks cannot fly, nests close to the sea provide easy access when leaving the colony. Generally, razorbills do not build a nest; however, some pairs may use their bills to drag material upon which to lay their egg. Nest under a boulder, rarely on an exposed ledge, may use Puffin or rabbit burrow. Although gregarious in breeding colonies, nests are not contiguous, but some metres apart, resulting in less aggression than in Guillemot colonies.

=== Incubation and hatching ===

Females lay a single egg per year, usually from late April to May. The egg is an ovoid-pyramidal shape, creamy white to pale brown with has dark brown blotches. Incubation starts generally 48 hours after laying the egg. Females and males take turns incubating the egg several times daily for a total of approximately 35 days before hatching occurs. Razorbill chicks are semi-precocial. During the first two days after hatching, the chick will spend the majority of its time under the parent&#x27;s wing. There is always one parent at the nest site while the other goes to sea to collect food for the chick. The hatchling develops a complete sheath 10 days after hatching. After 17–23 days, the chick leaves the nest by jumping from a cliff, closely followed by the male parent, who will accompany the chick to sea. During this time, the male parent will dive more than the female parent.

=== Feeding ===
Razorbills dive deep into the sea using their semi-folded wings and their streamlined bodies to propel themselves toward their prey. They keep their feet spread. While diving, they rarely stay in groups but rather spread out to feed. The majority of their feeding occurs at a depth of but they have the ability to dive up to below the surface. During a single dive, an individual can capture and swallow many schooling fish, depending on their size. Razorbills spend approximately 44% of their time foraging at sea.

When feeding their young, they generally deliver small loads. Adults will mainly feed only one fish to their chick with high feeding deliveries at dawn and decreased feeding 4 hours before dark. Females will generally feed their chicks more frequently than males. They may fly more than out to sea to feed when during egg incubation, but when provisioning the young, they forage closer to the nesting grounds, some away, and often in shallower water.

=== Diet ===
The diet of razorbill is very similar to that of a common murre or common guillemot. It consists generally of mid-water schooling fish such as capelin, sandeels, juvenile cod, sprats, and herring. It may also include crustaceans and polychaetes. A recent study suggests the diet is affected by local and regional environmental conditions in the marine environment.

== Predators ==
The adult razorbill has several predators which include great black-backed gulls, peregrine falcons, ravens, crows, and jackdaws. The general predators of their eggs are gulls and ravens. The best chance for adult razorbill to avoid predation is by diving. Arctic foxes and polar bears can also predate significant numbers of adults, eggs, and chicks in some years in the north of the species&#x27; range.

Razorbill eggs were collected until the late 1920s in Scotland&#x27;s remote St Kilda islands by their men scaling the cliffs. The eggs were buried in St Kilda peat ash to be eaten through the cold, northern winters. The eggs were considered to taste like duck eggs in taste and nourishment.

== Conservation and management ==

In the early 20th century, razorbills were harvested for eggs, meat, and feathers. This greatly decreased the global population. In the USA, they were finally protected by the 1917 Migratory Bird Treaty Act which reduced hunting. Other threatening interactions include oil pollution which can damage breeding sites. Any damage to breeding sites can reduce possible nest sites and affect the reproduction of the species. Commercial fishing affects populations because razorbills can become tangled in nets. Overfishing also decreases the abundance of razorbill prey and thus affects their survival.

== Evolution and prehistoric species ==
While the razorbill is the only living species, the genus &quot;Alca&quot; had a much higher diversity in the Pliocene. Some ornithologists also feel it is appropriate to retain the great auk in the genus &quot;Alca&quot;, instead of &quot;Pinguinus&quot;. A number of fossil forms have been found:

* &quot;Alca&quot; &quot;antiqua&quot; (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Lee Creek Mine, US)
* &quot;Alca&quot; sp. (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Lee Creek Mine, US) - possibly &quot;A. stewarti&quot;
* &quot;Alca stewarti&quot; (Kattendijk Sands Early Pliocene of Belgium)
* &quot;Alca ausonia&quot; (Yorktown Early Pliocene of Lee Creek Mine, US - Middle Pliocene of Italy)
* &quot;Alca&quot; sp. (Puerto de Mazarrón Pliocene of El Alamillo, Spain) - may be &quot;A. antiqua&quot; or &quot;A. ausonia&quot;

As far as is known, the genus &quot;Alca&quot; seems to have evolved in the western North Atlantic or the present-day Caribbean like most other Alcini. Its ancestors would have reached these waters through the still-open Isthmus of Panama during the Miocene.

<doc id="323069" wikidata="Q3266880" url="?curid=323069" title="Skeletal fluorosis">
<text>Skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease caused by excessive accumulation of fluoride leading to weakened bones. In advanced cases, skeletal fluorosis causes painful damage to bones and joints.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms are mainly promoted in the bone structure. Due to a high fluoride concentration in the body, the bone is hardened and thus less elastic, resulting in an increased frequency of fractures. Other symptoms include thickening of the bone structure and accumulation of bone tissue, which both contribute to impaired joint mobility. Ligaments and cartilage can become ossified. Most patients with skeletal fluorosis show side effects from the high fluoride dose such as ruptures of the stomach lining and nausea.
Fluoride can also damage the parathyroid glands, leading to hyperparathyroidism, the uncontrolled secretion of parathyroid hormones. These hormones regulate calcium concentration in the body. An elevated parathyroid hormone concentration results in a depletion of calcium in bone structures and thus a higher calcium concentration in the blood. 

The clinical symptoms of fluoride toxicity in the bones are indistinguishable from arthritis. Even low level exposure to fluoride can cause or worsen the symptoms in consumers with vulnerable genotypes.

==Causes==
Common causes of fluorosis include inhalation of fluoride dusts or fumes by workers in industry and consumption of fluoride from drinking water (levels of fluoride in excess of levels that are considered safe.)

In India, especially the Nalgonda region (Telangana), a common cause of fluorosis is fluoride-rich drinking water that is sourced from deep-bore wells. Over half of groundwater sources in India have fluoride above recommended levels.

Fluorosis can also occur as a result of volcanic activity. The 1783 eruption of the Laki volcano in Iceland is estimated to have killed about 22% of the Icelandic population, and 60% of livestock, as a result of fluorosis and sulfur dioxide gases. The 1693 eruption of Hekla also led to fatalities of livestock under similar conditions.

=== Skeletal fluorosis phases ===
==Treatment==
As of now, there are no established treatments for skeletal fluorosis patients. However, it is reversible in some cases, depending on the progression of the disease. If fluorine intake is stopped, the amount in bone will decrease and be excreted via urine. However, it is a very slow process to eliminate the fluorine from the body completely. Minimal results are seen in patients.
Treatment of side effects is also very difficult. For example, a patient with a bone fracture cannot be treated according to standard procedures, because the bone is very brittle. In this case, recovery will take a very long time and a pristine healing cannot be guaranteed. However, further fluorosis can be prevented by drinking defluoridated water. It is recently suggested that drinking of defluoridated water from the &quot;calcium amended-hydroxyapatite&quot; defluoridation method may help in the fluorosis reversal. Defluoridated water from this suggested method provides calcium-enriched alkaline drinking water as generally fluoride contaminated water has a low amount of calcium mineral and drinking alkaline water helps in eliminating the toxic fluoride from the body.

==Epidemiology==
In some areas, skeletal fluorosis is endemic. While fluorosis is most severe and widespread in the world&#x27;s two most populous countries – India and China – UNICEF estimates that &quot;fluorosis is endemic in at least 25 countries across the globe. The total number of people affected is not known, but a conservative estimate would number in the tens of millions.&quot;

In India, 20 states have been identified as endemic areas, with an estimated 60 million people at risk and 6 million people disabled; about 600,000 might develop a neurological disorder as a consequence.

==Effects on animals==

The histological changes which are induced through fluorine on rats resemble those of humans.

Employing nearly 4,000 faculty members, the university offers 174 baccalaureate programs, 199 master&#x27;s programs, 101 doctoral programs, and 88 certificate programs.

The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;, with over $416 million in research expenditures across its three campuses in 2022. Its Norman campus has two prominent museums, the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art, specializing in French Impressionism and Native American artwork, and the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, specializing in the natural history of Oklahoma.

The University of Oklahoma has won 44 team national championships, ranking the Sooners 13th all-time in NCAA team titles. OU also ranks 7th all-time in the number of NCAA Academic All-Americans with 215 athletes. The women&#x27;s softball team has won the national championship eight times: in 2000, 2013, and consecutively in 2016 and 2017 and in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. The gymnastics teams have won a combined 18 national championships, with the men&#x27;s team winning eight in the last 15 years, including three consecutive titles from 2015 to 2017.

Beginning with the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Sooners have made 90 appearances at the Olympics and collected 23 medals in total.

==History==
With the support of Governor George Washington Steele, on December 18, 1890, the Oklahoma Territorial legislature established three universities: the state university in Norman, the agricultural and mechanical college in Stillwater (later renamed Oklahoma State University) and a normal school in Edmond (later renamed University of Central Oklahoma). Oklahoma&#x27;s admission into the union in 1907 led to the renaming of the Norman Territorial University as the University of Oklahoma. Norman residents donated of land for the university south of the Norman railroad depot. The university&#x27;s first president ordered the planting of trees before the construction of the first campus building because he &quot;could not visualize a treeless university seat.&quot; Landscaping remains important to the university.

The university&#x27;s first president, David Ross Boyd, arrived in Norman in August 1892, and the first students enrolled that year. The university established a School of Pharmacy in 1893 because of the territory&#x27;s high demand for pharmacists. Three years later, the university awarded its first degree to a pharmaceutical chemist. The &quot;Rock Building&quot; in downtown Norman held the initial classes until the university&#x27;s first building opened on September 6, 1893.

On January 6, 1903, the university&#x27;s only building burned down and destroyed many records of the early university. Construction began immediately on a new building, as several other towns hoped to convince the university to move. President Boyd and the faculty were not dismayed by the loss. Mathematics professor Frederick Elder said, &quot;What do you need to keep classes going? Two yards of blackboard and a box of chalk.&quot; As a response to the fire, English professor Vernon Louis Parrington created a plan for the development of the campus. Although much of the plan was never implemented, Parrington&#x27;s suggestion for the campus core formed the basis for the North Oval. The North and South Ovals are now distinctive features of the campus.

The campus has a distinctive architecture, with buildings designed in a unique &quot;Cherokee Gothic&quot; style. The style has many features of the Gothic era but has also mixed the designs of local Native American tribes from Oklahoma. This term was coined by the renowned American architect Frank Lloyd Wright when he visited the campus. The university has built over a dozen buildings in the Cherokee Gothic style.
In 1907, Oklahoma entered statehood, fostering changes in the state&#x27;s political atmosphere. Up until this point, Oklahoma&#x27;s Republican tendencies changed with the election of Oklahoma&#x27;s first governor, the Democratic Charles N. Haskell. Since the university&#x27;s inception, religion had divided those on campus. Early in the university&#x27;s existence, many professors were Presbyterian, as was Boyd. Under pressure, Boyd hired several Baptists and Southern Methodists. The Presbyterians and Baptists coexisted but the Southern Methodists conflicted with the administration. Two notable Methodists, Nathaniel Lee Linebaugh and Ernest Taylor Bynum, were critics of Boyd and activists in Haskell&#x27;s election campaign. When Haskell took office, he fired many of the university&#x27;s Republicans, including President Boyd.

The campus expanded over the next several decades. By 1932, the university encompassed . Development of South Oval allowed for the southern expansion of the campus. The university built a new library on the oval&#x27;s north end in 1936. By convincing the Oklahoma legislature to increase their original pledge of $200,000 for the library to $500,000, President Bizzell ensured an even greater collection of research materials for students and faculty.
Enrollment in 1945 dropped to 3,769, from its pre–World War II high of 6,935 in 1939.

Many infrastructure changes have occurred at the university. The southern portion of south campus near Constitution Avenue, still known to long-time Norman residents as &#x27;South Base&#x27;, was originally built as an annex to Naval Air Station Norman. It contained mostly single-story frame buildings used for classrooms and military housing. By the late 1980s, most were severely deteriorated and were demolished in the 1990s to make room for redevelopment. The Jimmie Austin University of Oklahoma Golf Course was built as a U.S. Navy recreational facility.

During World War II, OU was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

The north campus and airfield were built in the early 1940s as Naval Air Station Norman. The station served mainly an advanced flight training mission and could handle all but the largest bombers. A large earthen mound east of Interstate 35 and north of Robinson Street, colloquially known as &#x27;Mount Williams&#x27;, was a gunnery (the mound has been removed to make way for a commercial development). In the post–World War II demobilization, the university received the installation. Naval aviator&#x27;s wings displayed at the entrance to the terminal commemorates this airfield&#x27;s Naval past.

After the World War, the university enjoyed rapid growth and a surge in enrollment. By 1965, enrollment had risen over 450% to 17,268, causing housing shortages. In the mid-1960s, three new 12-story dormitories were erected immediately south of the South Oval. In addition to these three towers, they built an apartment complex for married students, including men returning to college under the GI Bill.
In 1943 George Lynn Cross took over as president of the university. He served until 1968, 25 years later.

The Civil Rights Movement began a new era as the university began policies against racial discrimination and segregation after legal challenges and court cases outlawed discrimination. The Bizzell Memorial Library has been designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in commemoration of the cases of G. W. McLaurin, a black man denied admission to graduate school in 1948. A court case effectively forced the Board of Regents to vote to admit McLaurin, but he was directed to study in a separated area within the law library and to be allowed to lunch only in a segregated area. The National Association for Advancement of Colored People brought the case to the U.S. Supreme court in &quot;McLaurin vs. Oklahoma State Board of Regents&quot;. In 1950, the court overturned the university&#x27;s policy for segregation at the graduate school level. The case was an important precedent for the more famous and sweeping 1954 case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; which disallowed &quot;separate but equal&quot; policy at all school levels.

Since David Boren became president in 1994, the University of Oklahoma system has experienced tremendous growth and purchased for OU-Tulsa, the new Gaylord Hall, Price Hall, the ExxonMobil Lawrence G. Rawl Engineering Practice Facility, Devon Energy Hall, the Wagner Student Academic Services Center, the Research and Medical Clinic, the expansions of the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art, and the National Weather Center.

In March 2015, the University of Oklahoma shut down the Oklahoma Kappa chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity when a video surfaced that showed members singing a racist chant as they rode a bus. University of Oklahoma president David Boren gave members two days to leave the fraternity house. He also expelled two students who he said &quot;played a leadership role&quot; in the incident, creating &quot;a hostile learning environment for others&quot;. The expulsion, allegedly without due process, earned the university a spot on the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education&#x27;s 2016 &quot;10 Worst Colleges for Free Speech&quot;.

David Boren, a former U.S. senator and Governor of Oklahoma, served as the university&#x27;s president from 1994 to 2018. James L. Gallogly succeeded Boren on July 1, 2018, only to retire ten months later. OU College of Law Dean Joseph Harroz Jr. was appointed effective immediately May 16, 2019 to a 15-month term as interim president. On May 9, 2020, Harroz was announced as the 15th president of the university by the Board of Regents.

==Campuses==
===Norman campus===
As of Fall of 2024, the Norman campus had 23,351 undergraduate students and 7,522 postgraduate students.

Following the Sooners&#x27; 2000 football national-championship season the university experienced an increase in college applicants and admissions. The falls of 1999 and 2000 both saw a 1.3% increase in the number of students over the respective previous years, while fall 2001 saw an increase of 4.8% over 2000.
The largest school, the College of Arts and Sciences, enrolls 35.2% of the OU-Norman students. The College of Arts &amp; Sciences offers several programs, which include internships and most notably a joint archaeological program (with Saint Anselm College of Goffstown, New Hampshire) in Orvieto, Italy. The next largest school, The Price College of Business enrolls 13%. Other large colleges on the Norman campus include the College of Engineering with 10.6% and the College of Education, Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication, and College of Liberal Studies, each with approximately 6% of the student body.

Smaller schools include the Colleges of Architecture and Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences, Earth and Energy, the Weitzenhoffer Family College of Fine Arts, and the College of Law.

New students do not have to declare a major (a concentrated course of study) immediately and are not required to declare a major until their Junior year. If they are undecided in their major, they are considered a part of the University College, composing approximately 8% of the student body. Many Pre-Health majors choose this option until they are able to apply for the medical program of their choice.

The Norman campus has three sections: north campus, main campus, and south campus. All three are connected by a bus service funded by student fees which allows students to park at Lloyd Noble Center and provides 5- to 10-minute service to the main and south campuses. Other regular Norman bus routes provide service to north campus as well as the main campus. The main and south campus are contiguous while the north campus is about two miles north of the main campus.

The Norman campus is the focus of a number of ghost stories, some negative, some positive.

====Main campus====
The main campus is bordered by Boyd Street on the north, Timberdell Road on the south, Chautauqua Avenue on the west, and Jenkins Avenue on the east. The Norman campus is centered on two large &quot;ovals.&quot; The Parrington Oval (or North Oval as it is commonly called) is anchored on the south by Evans Hall, the main administrative building. This building highlights the &quot;Cherokee Gothic&quot; style of architecture locally derived from the Collegiate Gothic style, the style that dominates and defines the older buildings on the OU campus. The North Oval is bordered on the east by the Oklahoma Memorial Union. 

On the east side of the northernmost part of campus sits Sarkeys Energy Center while to the west is the Fred Jones, Jr. School of Art and Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art, home to the Weitzenhoffer Collection of Impressionist art and the Catlett Music Center. Just south of Catlett is Goddard Health Center, an on-campus clinic that provides medical care and counseling and testing services to students, faculty, staff, and their dependents. Goddard comprises the OU Health Services laboratory, Counseling Services, Health Promotion, and a pharmacy. The Van Vleet Oval (or South Oval) is anchored on the north by the Bizzell Memorial Library and flanked by academic buildings. When class is in session, the South Oval is often inundated with students going to and from class. Elm Avenue bounds the western edge of the academic portion of OU, with a few exceptions. Lying between Elm Avenue and Chautauqua Avenue are mostly fraternity and sorority houses. 

On the east side of the central part of campus lies Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium, just north of Lindsey Street on Jenkins Avenue. Immediately adjacent to the stadium is the Barry Switzer Center, a museum highlighting the historical success of Oklahoma athletics, as well as a comprehensive training facility for Oklahoma athletes. North of the stadium is the McCasland Field House, the former home of Oklahoma Basketball and the current home of Oklahoma&#x27;s wrestling, volleyball and gymnastics programs. Across Jenkins Avenue are the athletic dorms and statues honoring Oklahoma&#x27;s past seven Heisman Trophy winners. Other statues on campus include several honoring the Native Americans who defined much of Oklahoma&#x27;s history and a new memorial statue on the north side of Oklahoma Memorial Stadium honoring OU students, faculty, and staff that have died while serving in the armed forces.
The portion of OU&#x27;s main campus south of Lindsey Street includes three colleges, university housing, student activity and fitness facilities, and the Oklahoma Center for Continuing Education. The Joe C. and Carole Kerr McClendon Honors College is in David L. Boren Hall, which serves as an Academic Arts Community where residential rooms, faculty offices, classrooms, a computer center and library are all available in the same building. Other residence halls include the twelve-story Adams, Couch and Walker Centers, as well as Cate Center, made up of three- and four-story buildings, which are transitioning to faculty offices.

Adjacent to the residence facilities are the Sarkeys Fitness Center (formerly the Houston Huffman Fitness Center), Henderson-Tolson Cultural Center and the Jim Thorpe Multicultural Center. The Murray Case Sells Swim Complex is also nearby, providing indoor and outdoor swimming opportunities for the OU community. The Oklahoma Center for Continuing Education (OCCE) is one of eleven W. K. Kellogg Foundation-funded centers in the United States and Britain. It is home to OU Outreach, which consists of the College of Continuing Education and the College of Liberal Studies, and includes a conference center able to host events of up to 1500 participants.

The Oklahoma administration prides itself on the aesthetic appeal of the campus. All three campuses (Norman, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa) have beautifully landscaped gardens. Trees were planted on the OU campus before the first building was ever built. There are also many statues and sculptures around campus, most of which portray the strong influence of the Native American culture.

There are also four buildings on the main campus that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They are the Bizzell Library, the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house, Casa Blanca (the old Alpha Chi Omega sorority house), and Boyd House – the residence of the university president.
In September 2008, it was announced that the University of Oklahoma&#x27;s main campus will be entirely powered by wind by 2013. According to OU president David Boren, &quot;It is our patriotic duty as Americans to help our country achieve energy independence and to be sound stewards of the environment.&quot; The school plans to purchase its energy from the OU Spirit Wind Farm, which is scheduled for construction near Woodward in late 2009. The new source of energy is projected to cost the university an additional $5 million per year.

The Anne and Henry Zarrow School of Social Work was completed on the Norman campus in 2011 and houses facilities for the training of undergraduate and graduate social workers. The 12 million dollar building is named for the Zarrow family, a philanthropic couple from Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Zarrows donated $5 million as the keystone donors for the new building with the remaining funds coming from a bequest of Ruth I. Knee, a graduate of the program, and a portion of the states federal stimulus funds.

====North campus====
On the far north side of Norman is the OU Research Campus-North, which includes University of Oklahoma Max Westheimer Airport (ICAO: KOUN), the Radar Operations Center, the old National Severe Storms Laboratory facility, the OU OKDHS Training and Research Center, and Merrick Computer and Technology Center. Additional research facilities as part of OU&#x27;s Gallogly College of Engineering also operate out of North campus including the High-Speed Aerothermodynamics Laboratory, Measurement and Automation Laboratory, Laboratory for Electrical Energy and Power Systems, and Laboratory for Smart Buildings.

OU&#x27;s College of Aviation runs a programs in the education of future pilots, air traffic controllers and aviation industry professionals. The Aviation Accreditation Board has accredited the College of Aviation at North Base as one of only 29 accredited colleges in the world.

====South campus====
South of student housing is Timberdell Road, the approximate southern boundary of the university. South of this road are University-owned apartments and athletic complexes. Also on the south side of Timberdell Road is the College of Law building which was expanded in 2002 by the addition of a larger law library and courtroom. There are additional athletic complexes in this area, including L. Dale Mitchell Baseball Park, the OU Softball Field, and Lloyd Noble Center (the basketball arena).

OU owns the wooded area just south of Highway 9 between Chautauqua and Jenkins. This area is called Oliver&#x27;s Woods. Ecology classes take field trips to Oliver&#x27;s Woods frequently. They can use the area to study Ecological patterns including tree growth and pH in the ground. Visible patterns of plant dispersion can be studied in Oliver&#x27;s Woods as well, including uniform, random, and clumped patterns. The area has a trail for people to follow and a creek running through the lower elevated area.

====Research campus====
While this area has traditionally lacked academic buildings, the pressure of expansion in the northern part of campus led to the construction of new academic buildings – such as the National Weather Center and Stephenson Research and Technology Center – on the south end of campus. This area, now termed The University of Oklahoma&#x27;s Research Campus, &quot;brings academic, public and private sector organizations together in a mutually beneficial collaborative environment.&quot;

In 2004, global weather information provider WeatherNews opened its U.S. Operations Center in One Partners Place, in the research campus one block from the new NWC building. The southern boundary of the research campus is State Highway 9. OU&#x27;s Advanced Radar Research Center is also on the Research campus in its new Radar Innovations Laboratory building.

 the Life Sciences Research Center has opened, housing numerous chemical and biochemical research labs. Other buildings on the research campus include One Partners Place, Two Partners Place, Three Partners Place, Four Partners Place, and Five Partners Place. Housed within these buildings are the Center for Spatial Analysis and the Center for Applied Social Research among several others.

===Health Sciences Center===
The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center&#x27;s main campus is at the Oklahoma Health Center in Oklahoma City, while a secondary Health Sciences campus is in Tulsa. About 3,500 students enroll in one of the seven colleges at the Health Center. The distribution of students in each of these colleges is more uniform than that of the main campus.
The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), established in the early 20th century, is OU&#x27;s presence in Oklahoma City. OUHSC is one of only four academic health centers in the nation with seven professional colleges. The nineteen buildings that make up the OUHSC campus occupies a fifteen block area in Oklahoma City near the Oklahoma State Capitol. Surrounding these buildings are an additional twenty health-related buildings some of which are owned by the University of Oklahoma. With approximately 600 students and 600 residents and fellows training in specialties and subspecialties of medicine, the College of Medicine is the largest part of the Health Sciences Center. The major clinical facilities on campus are the OU Medical Center hospital complex, which and include The Children&#x27;s Hospital, the OU Physicians clinics, and the Oklahoma City Veterans Administration Medical Center. The Oklahoma Health Center at large has large, university-operated biomedical research facilities joined on campus by a growing biomedical and pharmaceutical research corporations developed by the Presbyterian Health Foundation, dedicated to biotechnology, research, and new scientific ventures.

=== University of Oklahoma-Tulsa Schusterman Center ===
The University of Oklahoma-Tulsa Schusterman Center (OU-Tulsa) is home to all OU programs in Tulsa, OU Physicians-Tulsa, and the School of Community Medicine. OU-Tulsa offers six bachelor&#x27;s degree completion programs; 14 master&#x27;s degree programs; doctoral programs in medicine, physical therapy, education, early childhood education, engineering and nursing, as well as nine residency programs in medicine. Graduate certificate programs are also offered at OU-Tulsa.

More than 200 full-time faculty teach OU-Tulsa students and enrollment at OU-Tulsa exceeds 1,600 students. More than 1,000 employees work at the OU-Tulsa Schusterman Center and OU Physicians medical clinics throughout Tulsa. OU-Tulsa has service, education and research affiliations with more than 100 community agencies.

====Norman-based programs====

Programs offered at OU-Tulsa that are affiliated with departments on the Norman (main) campus of OU are referred to as Norman-based programs even when offered at OU-Tulsa. Norman-based programs on the Tulsa campus are primarily graduate level programs although an undergraduate degree completion program in Social Work is now being offered. Masters and doctoral level graduate programs as well as graduate certificate programs affiliated with a number of colleges on the Norman campus are offered on the Tulsa campus. The College of Arts and Sciences is the largest college on the Tulsa campus and includes programs in Human Relations, Library and Information Studies, Organizational Dynamics, Public Administration, and Social Work. Some graduate programs offered at OU-Tulsa are unique to the Tulsa campus such as Urban Design and Organizational Dynamics. Norman-based programs offered in Tulsa are predominately professional programs that include non-traditional scheduling formats such as evening and compressed format weekend courses to support the needs of working adults.

====Health-science programs====

Established in 1972 as a branch of the main Health Sciences Center campus in Oklahoma City, the OU School of Community Medicine, formerly the College of Medicine–Tulsa, has enabled the university to establish medical residencies and provide for expanded health care capabilities in the state. Between 1972 and 1999, OU&#x27;s presence in Tulsa had grown but scattered. In 1999, a site formerly owned by BP Amoco was sold to the university for $24 million (even though the property was appraised at $48 million). The site already featured a building with offices, labs, and classrooms. The university purchased this property with the help of a $10 million gift from the Charles and Lynn Schusterman Family Foundation. The existing building was renamed the &quot;Schusterman Center&quot;. This historic, 60-acre property in the heart of Tulsa features original mid-century architecture surrounded by nearly 1,000 trees. New construction of the Schusterman Library and Schusterman Learning Center at OU-Tulsa has been designed in keeping with the original building style.

In 2003, Tulsa voters approved the Vision 2025 plan for capital improvements to the Tulsa metro area. Included in this plan was $30 million for a new Research and Medical Clinic near the existing Schusterman Center. Construction on the new building, the OU Schusterman Clinic, was completed in June 2007.

OU-Tulsa is also home to the OU School of Community Medicine. Created with the support of a $50 million donation from the George Kaiser Family Foundation, the school&#x27;s mission is to improve the health status of all Oklahomans, particularly the urban and rural underserved.

The OU School of Community Medicine faculty comprises around 200 physicians representing a wide field of specialties. These doctors also form the OU Physicians medical practice group, which provides care to patients at some 25 clinic sites in the Tulsa area. The faculty&#x27;s time is split among teaching medical students, supervising medical residents and providing patient care.

===OU in Arezzo===
In 2012, The University of Oklahoma purchased a monastery in Arezzo, Italy. In early 2016, renovations to the monastery neared completion and OU began the use of its newest permanent &quot;campus&quot; (denominated as a &quot;Study Center&quot;) location outside of the state of Oklahoma. The university expects that one in five OU students who study abroad will go through the Arezzo campus. The Arezzo campus has been described by university president, David Boren, as a first step for students and their parents to become acquainted with the world and gain an educational experience in a foreign land. The campus is scheduled to be dedicated in the summer of 2016. Boren chose the smaller town of Arezzo in part because of the small size of the town relative to nearby Florence, which boasts programs from about 50 American universities. With such a large number of American college students in Florence, Boren was concerned that OU students would have socialized with other Americans rather than the local Italians.

===Other study centers===
OU has study centers in Puebla, Mexico, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A center is planned for İzmir, Turkey.

==Academics==


The University of Oklahoma is a large residential, research university. The university consists of fifteen colleges, including 174 majors. Native American studies includes language classes in Cherokee, Choctaw, Mvskoke, and Kiowa as part of the university&#x27;s Native American language program; currently Creek, Choctaw, and Cherokee I, II, and III are offered in both fall and spring semesters. The university has a high four-year full-time undergraduate enrollment including a high transfer-in population. While the two main campuses are in Norman and Oklahoma City, affiliated programs in Tulsa expand access for students in eastern Oklahoma. Some of the programs in Tulsa include: architecture, arts and sciences, education, engineering, medicine, nursing, public health, allied health and liberal arts studies.
In addition to 174 majors to choose from, the University of Oklahoma also has a nationally recognized Honors College featuring its own dedicated faculty, dormitories, and writing center. Every student from any major can apply to the college; if accepted the student is eligible to take honors classes and graduate cum laude. In order to graduate with honors, the student must complete 18 credit hours of honors classes and submit an honors thesis. Transfer students are able to transfer up to nine credit hours of honor classes from a different university.

In addition to being a member of the Southeastern Universities Research Association and Universities Research Association, undergraduate admission to the University of Oklahoma is categorized by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education as &quot;more selective&quot;. For the 2010–2011 school year, 9,996 applied and 8,498 were admitted (85%). The university&#x27;s freshman retention rate in 2009 was 82% and the six-year graduation rate was 62.0%.

In May 2019, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; said that the University of Oklahoma gave &quot;inflated&quot; data on its alumni giving rates for two decades and in response, would show the university as unranked in its 2019 edition of &quot;Best Colleges&quot; rankings.

=== Drama School ===
The School of Drama was founded in 1931 and expanded significantlyby 1946, when over 150 students took courses there. By 1948, dramatic performances were given in the North Campus auditorium, a Studio Theater and a Little Theater on the North Campus. Main productions were produced in Holmberg Hall on the Main Campus. 150 students were enrolled in theater and radio education. Rupel J. Jones was chairman of the School of Drama. A theater on campus was originally named after Jones, but in 2015 was named after Elsie C. Brackett. The drama library was based on the lifetime collection of play clippings by Winnie Rice Bixler, the wife of a Norman newspaper editor.

==Museums and libraries==
The university has two prominent museums, the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art and the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History.

* The Museum of Art was founded in 1936 and originally headed by Oscar Jacobson, the director of the School of Art at the time. The museum opened with over 2,500 items on display and was originally on campus in Jacobson Hall. Mr. and Mrs. Fred Jones of Oklahoma City donated money for a permanent building in 1971 and the building was named in honor of their son who died in a plane crash during his senior year at the University of Oklahoma. Since then, the museum has acquired many renowned works of Native American art and, in 2000, received the Weitzenhoffer Collection of French Impressionism which includes works by Degas, Gauguin, Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec, Van Gogh, and Vuillard. the museum has over 65,000 square feet (6,000 m2) filled with over 8,000 items from a wide array of time periods and movements. In 2005, the museum expanded with the opening of the new Lester Wing designed by contemporary architect Hugh Newell Jacobsen. The architectural style of the new addition deviates from the Collegiate Gothic style of the university, but Jacobsen felt this was necessary given the contemporary works of art the wing would house.
* The Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, south of the main campus and directly southwest of the law building, specializes in the history of the people and animals that have inhabited Oklahoma over the last 300 million years. Since its founding in 1899, the museum has acquired over 5 million objects. In 2000, a new building was opened to house the ever-expanding museum. The new building offered nearly 200,000 square feet (18,600 m2) of space to display the many exhibits the museum has to offer.
The University of Oklahoma Library system has its headquarters in Bizzell Memorial Library. It is the largest research library in Oklahoma and contains over 4.7 million volumes. It contains more than 1.6 million photographs, subscriptions to over 31,000 periodicals, over 1.5 million maps, government documents dating back to 1893, and over 50 incunabula. It has five locations on campus. The primary library is Bizzell Memorial Library, in the middle of the main campus. Other notable campus libraries include the Architecture Library, the Fine Arts Library, and the Geology Library. The OU library system contains many unique collections such as the History of Science Collections (which houses over 94,000 volumes related to the history of science, including hand-noted works by Galileo Galilei), the Bizzell Bible Collection, and the Western History Collection.

The School of Library and Information Studies (SLIS), the only American Library Association-accredited program in Oklahoma, offers a graduate degree (Master of Library and Information Studies) and an undergraduate degree (Bachelor of Arts in Information Studies). The impact of OU and SLIS on the history of libraries in Oklahoma is shown in the recent list of 100 Oklahoma Library Legends as produced by the Oklahoma Library Association. Two current faculty, one faculty emeriti, and numerous others associated with either the OU libraries or SLIS account for nearly 10% of the list&#x27;s members.

==Residential life==

Oklahoma requires, with few exceptions, that all freshmen live in one of the six residence halls: the Towers, which are two (formerly three) 12-story buildings on the south side of campus.

David L. Boren Hall is the fourth major residence hall on campus. Headington Hall, completed in the Summer of 2013, is the fifth major residence hall on campus.

Dunham and Headington Residential Colleges are the sixth and newest major residence hall, having opened in 2017. Dunham and Headington are connected by a dining hall that is open to all students.

The university owns several apartment complexes around the campus.

Due to a low cost of living in Oklahoma, many students find it financially viable to live off campus in apartments or houses. In recent years, many new apartment or condominium complexes (not including the OU-owned properties) have been built. Some students commute from nearby Moore and Oklahoma City.

==Student organizations, activities, and media==
The Pride of Oklahoma, the university&#x27;s marching band, celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2004 and consists of 311 student musicians and dancers from 19 states. Students wishing to enter the band go through a rigorous audition process. The band plays at every home football game. A smaller pep band, which usually consists of 100 members, travels to every away football game. The full band makes trips to the AT&amp;T Red River Rivalry game against The University of Texas, Big 12 Championship Game, bowl games and other games of importance. Members of the band are also present for many student events. It was awarded the Sudler Trophy in 1987. In 2007, The Pride of Oklahoma marched in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, making it one of only a few bands to have ever marched in both the Tournament of Roses and Macy&#x27;s Parades.
The local chapter of the Army ROTC provides officer training and education for nearly 100 OU students. Officially founded in 1919, it is one of the oldest such programs in the nation. OU Army ROTC cadets are active in numerous campus and state activities. They provide military color guards for Sooner football games and various on-campus ceremonies and events. After completing the Army ROTC program, OU students receive a commission in either the Regular Army, Army Reserve, or National Guard.

The campus student radio station, Studio U, broadcasts over the Internet. The campus TV station, OUTV, features student-produced programming five nights a week and is available on Public-access television cable TV (Cox Communications Ch. 124, ATT uVerse 99) also via Facebook and YouTube sites. &quot;OU Nightly&quot;, the live student newscast, airs weekdays at 7:00am, 12:00pm, 4:30pm live and 9:30pm. &quot;Sooner Sportspad&quot;, a live sports program, airs live Monday nights at 7:30 on Fox Sports SW and throughout the week as repeats on OUTV. Oklahoma&#x27;s Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication programs Studio U and OUTV. Oklahoma&#x27;s Department of Continuing Education operates KROU and KGOU, a public radio station broadcasting on 106.3 FM. KGOU is affiliated with NPR.

The campus newspaper, &quot;The Oklahoma Daily&quot;, is produced daily during the fall and spring semesters and weekly during the summer semester. &quot;The Oklahoma Daily&quot;″s sister publication, &quot;Sooner&quot; yearbook, creates a 400-page coffee table book for current students and alumni. &quot;Sooner&quot;, ranked as one of the top two yearbooks nationwide, focuses on capturing the year with storytelling packages of text, photos and design.

==Athletics==

The school&#x27;s sports teams are called the Sooners, a nickname given to early settlers during the land run who sneaked into the offered territory and staked claims illegally before they were officially allowed to. They participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I-Bowl Subdivision and in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The school sponsors nine sports for both men and women. The university has claimed 43 team national championships, which includes 17 football national championships (football championships are not awarded by the NCAA). By far, OU&#x27;s most famous and storied athletic program is the football program, which has produced seven Heisman Trophy winners: Billy Vessels in 1952, Steve Owens in 1969, Billy Sims in 1978, Jason White in 2003, Sam Bradford in 2008, Baker Mayfield in 2017, and Kyler Murray in 2018. Many Pro Football Hall of Famers, including Lee Roy Selmon and Troy Aikman, also attended the University of Oklahoma. In 1988, OU became the first school to participate in both the football and basketball national championships in the same year, an achievement unequaled until the 2006 season, when Ohio State and the University of Florida were both in each, with Florida winning both games. Oklahoma also currently holds the record for the longest winning streak in NCAA Division I history when they won 47 consecutive games between 1953 and 1957. In reference to the team&#x27;s success and popularity as a symbol of state pride, George Lynn Cross, OU&#x27;s president from 1943 to 1968, once told the Oklahoma State Senate, &quot;I want a university the football team can be proud of.&quot;
The wrestling program is the fourth most decorated in college wrestling, having won seven national championships. The men&#x27;s gymnastics team has won twelve national championships, the most out of all sports at the University of Oklahoma. In addition, Oklahoma has produced five Nissen Emery Award winners, more than any other school and the only school with back-to-back honorees. The women&#x27;s gymnastics team was crowned co-national champions with the University of Florida in 2014 and won back-to-back national championships in 2016 and 2017. The softball team has won eight national championships, the first in 2000 another in 2013, back to back titles in 2016 and 2017, and four consecutive titles in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. The baseball team won a national championship in 1951 and 1994. On May 10, 2007, the university announced the addition of women&#x27;s rowing to the intercollegiate athletics program. A rowing facility will be built on the Oklahoma River near downtown Oklahoma City. This is the first sport added since women&#x27;s soccer was added in 1996.

The University of Oklahoma has had a long and bitter rivalry with the University of Texas known as the Red River Shootout, Red River Rivalry, or OU–Texas, with Texas having the better overall record at 59–43–5. This rivalry is often thought of as a contest of state pride along with school pride. OU also has a long-standing rivalry with Oklahoma State University. Known as the Bedlam Series, it encompasses all the athletic contests between the two universities with the winner receiving the Bedlam Bell. Another major historic rival is the University of Nebraska, which was part of the Big 8 Conference with Oklahoma and later joined with Oklahoma and other schools in the formation of the Big 12 Conference. The Sooners made football history December 6, 2008, when they scored sixty or more points in five consecutive games. This achievement occurred during their victory over the University of Missouri for the Big 12 Championship.

On June 30, 2021, the University of Oklahoma Board of Regents unanimously accepted an invitation to join the Southeastern Conference (SEC) along with the University of Texas beginning on July 1, 2024.

<text>Brauerei Paderborner is a brewery in the German city of Paderborn. The traditional Westphalian brewery was purchased by the German brewery-major Warsteiner in 1990.

==The Paderborner beer range==
The Paderborner brewery was founded in 1852. Since 1990 it has been part of the Warsteiner brewery group.

There are two different sorts of Paderborner. The first is simply called &quot;Paderborner Pilsener&quot; and has a rather herbal taste with an unusual sweetness which is actually hops. Paderborner Pilsener Export has a reputation for being of lower quality but also a compromise between price and amount of alcohol (since it has a barely larger amount of alcohol).

The second type is called Paderborner Gold and has a much fresher taste. It is a more recent variety than the original Paderborner Pilsener which has been brewed in this area for over 100 years. It was developed when the big Warsteiner company bought the small local brewery of Paderborn.

Paderborner Gold is the favoured beer for all official festivities in the area.

The Paderborner brewery also offers mixed beers, namely with Cola and Lemon.

An attempt to copy the famous &quot;Alt&quot; beer (famous from Düsseldorf) was also made in 2008, named &quot;Paderborner Alt&quot;

The city of Paderborn is home to a great many festivals, including the Schützenfest (&quot;shooting club festival&quot;) and the Libori festival.

<text>Oklahoma State University (informally Oklahoma State or OSU) is a public land-grant research university in Stillwater, Oklahoma, United States. The university was established in 1890 under the legislation of the Morrill Act. Originally known as Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College (Oklahoma A&amp;M), the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater is the flagship institution of the Oklahoma State University System, which enrolls more than 34,000 students across its five institutions with an annual budget of $1.86 billion for fiscal year 2024. As of Fall 2023, 26,008 students are enrolled at the university. OSU is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. According to the National Science Foundation, the university spent $226.5 million on research and development in 2023.

The Oklahoma State Cowboys and Cowgirls have won 55 national championships including 53 NCAA championships, which ranks sixth in most NCAA team national championships after Stanford, UCLA, USC, Texas, and Penn State. Oklahoma State University students and alumni have won 34 Olympic medals (21 gold, 5 silver, and 8 bronze). The university has produced 48 Fulbright Scholars, an astronaut, and a billionaire. 

Students spend part of the fall semester preparing for OSU&#x27;s Homecoming celebration, begun in 1913, which draws more than 40,000 alumni and over 70,000 participants each year to campus. It is billed by the university as &quot;America&#x27;s Greatest Homecoming Celebration.&quot; The Oklahoma State University alumni network exceeds 250,000 graduates.

==History==
On December 25, 1890, the Oklahoma Territorial Legislature finally gained approval for Oklahoma Territorial Agricultural and Mechanical (A&amp;M) College, the land-grant institution established under the Morrill Act of 1862. The legislature specified that the college was to be within Payne County. Such an ambiguous description created a rivalry among towns in the county, with Stillwater ultimately gaining the campus. Upon statehood in 1907, &quot;Territorial&quot; was dropped from its title.

The first students assembled for class on December 14, 1891. For two and a half years, classes were held in local churches, until the first academic building, later known as Old Central, was constructed and dedicated on June 15, 1894, on the southeast corner of campus. It was surrounded by a flat plowed prairie.

In 1896, Oklahoma A&amp;M held its first commencement with six male graduates. The first Library was established in Old Central in one room shared with the English Department. The first campus building to have electricity, Williams Hall, was constructed in 1900. Because of its turreted architecture, it was referred to as the &quot;Castle of the Prairies&quot;; It survived until 1969.

One of the earliest campus buildings was also a barn, used as part of an agricultural experiment station, which was served by a large reservoir pond created in 1895. The barn burned down in 1922, but the pond, enlarged and remodeled in 1928 and 1943, is now known as Theta Pond, a popular campus scenic landmark. In 1906, Morrill Hall was completed and became the principal building on campus. A fire gutted the building in 1914, but the outside structure survived intact, and the interior was reconstructed.
On-campus housing at Oklahoma A&amp;M College began in 1910, with the opening of the Boys&#x27; Dormitory. Later renamed Crutchfield Hall, the Historic American Buildings Survey said it was significant as &quot;... the first permanent boy&#x27;s dormitory in Oklahoma ... [and] the sole surviving example of a pre-1930 utilitarian dormitory that is characteristic of modified Italian Renaissance Revival architecture&quot;. Crutchfield Hall later served the School of Music and the College of Engineering, Architecture, and Technology before it was ranked as outdated and demolished in 1995.

Also opened in 1910 was the Women&#x27;s Building, a dorm for female students that also contained a dining hall, home economics classes, and a women&#x27;s gymnasium. It was later named Garner Hall. Today it is known as the Bartlett Center for the Studio Arts and houses the Gardiner Art Gallery.

By 1919 the campus included Morrill Hall, the Central Building, the Engineering Building (now Gundersen Hall), the Women&#x27;s Building, the Auditorium (replaced later by the Seretean Center for Performing Arts), the Armory-Gymnasium (now the Architecture Building) and the Power Plant.

At the beginning of World War II, Oklahoma A&amp;M was one of six schools selected by the United States Navy to give the Primary School in the Electronics Training Program (ETP), also known as Naval Training School Elementary Electricity and Radio Materiel (NTS EE&amp;RM). Starting in March 1942, each month a new group of 100 Navy students arrived for three months of 14-hour days in concentrated electrical engineering study. Cordell Hall, the newest dormitory, was used for housing and meals; lectures and lab sessions were held in the Engineering Building. Professor Emory B. Phillips was the Director of Instruction. ETP admission required passing the Eddy Test, one of the most selective qualifying exams given during the war years. At a given time, some 500 Navy students were on the campus, a significant fraction of the war-years enrollment. The training activity continued until June 1945 and served a total of about 7,000 students; among these was Robert B. Kamm, a future professor and president of Oklahoma State University.

Much of the growth of Oklahoma A&amp;M and the architectural integrity of the campus can be attributed to Henry G. Bennett, who served as the school&#x27;s president from 1928 to 1950. Early in his tenure, Dr. Bennett developed a strategic vision for the university campus&#x27;s physical expansion. The plan was adopted in 1937, and his vision was followed for more than fifty years, including the predominant Georgian architecture style that permeates the campus. He intended the focal point to be a centrally located library building: this was the Edmon Low Library, which opened in 1953. Another major addition to the campus during the Bennett years was the Student Union, which opened in 1950. Subsequent additions and renovations have made the building one of the largest student union buildings in the world at . 

Oklahoma A&amp;M&#x27;s global engagement at an institutional level began in the 1950s when President Bennett was appointed in 1950 to be the first director of US President Harry Truman’s “Point Four Program,” a technical assistance program for developing countries. As part of the Point Four program, Oklahoma A&amp;M College entered into an agreement in 1952 with the government of Ethiopia to establish a technical high school, an agricultural university, and an agricultural extension service there. Faculty and staff from the Stillwater campus traveled to Ethiopia and established Jimma Agricultural Technical School (now Jimma University), the Imperial Ethiopian University of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts (now Haramaya University), and an agricultural and research station at Debra Zeit. In recognition of the contributions of the OSU staff, Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie visited the Stillwater campus in 1954, the first foreign head of state to visit Oklahoma and the only one to visit Stillwater.
On May 15, 1957, Oklahoma A&amp;M changed its name to the Oklahoma State University of Agricultural and Applied Sciences, to reflect the broadening scope of its curriculum. Oklahoma Gov. Raymond Gary signed the bill authorizing the name change passed by the 26th Oklahoma Legislature on May 15, 1957. However, the bill only authorized the Board of Regents to change the college&#x27;s name, a measure they voted on at their meeting on June 6. However, the name was quickly shortened to Oklahoma State University for most purposes, and the &quot;Agricultural &amp; Applied Sciences&quot; name was formally dropped in 1980. Subsequently, the Oklahoma State University System was created, with the Stillwater campus as the flagship institution and several outlying branches: OSU-Institute of Technology in Okmulgee (1946), OSU-Oklahoma City (1961), OSU-Tulsa (1984), and the Center for Health Sciences also in Tulsa (1988).

In 2005, OSU announced its &quot;Campus Master Plan&quot;, a campaign to enhance academic, athletic, and administrative facilities. Over $800 million is earmarked for campus construction and renovation over twenty years. The Plan calls for an &quot;athletic village&quot;, where all of the university&#x27;s athletic facilities will be located on the main campus. To accomplish this goal, the athletic department bought all (or nearly all) the property north of Boone Pickens Stadium up to McElroy between Knoblock and Washington streets. The city of Stillwater and property owners criticized this land gram. While the vast majority of the real estate was rental property appealing to college students, a few owners were longtime residents. A lone holdout in this parcel of land sued OSU over their right to use eminent domain to condemn and acquire their land. 
In 2006, OSU received a gift of $165 million from an alumnus T. Boone Pickens to the university&#x27;s athletic department, and in 2008 received another gift from Pickens, of $100 million for endowed academic chairs. It was the largest gift for academics ever given in the state. Ethical concerns have been raised by the media questioning the propriety of some of the Pickens&#x27; gifts, which were in media reports about the propriety of how some of the Pickens gifts have been made, were immediately returned to Pickens, and then placed in hedge funds owned by Pickens&#x27; companies In February 2010, Pickens announced that he was pledging another $100 million to fund a scholarship endowment as part of a $1 billion fund-raising campaign titled &quot;Branding Success.&quot; The pledge brought the total pledged or contributed to OSU by Pickens to over $500 million.

On October 24, 2015, during the annual homecoming parade, Adacia Chambers drove her vehicle into a crowd of people, killing 4 people and injuring 47. She faced 2nd-degree murder charges.

== Colleges ==
The medical campus has an affiliation with Oklahoma State University Medical Center for clinical training and offers residency/fellowship opportunities. Also with the medical school, OSU established a campus in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, the capital of the Cherokee Nation and the nation&#x27;s first, and currently only, tribally-affiliated medical school.

In 2020, the College of Education and Human Sciences was created, which merged the College of Human Sciences and College of Education, Health, and Aviation into a single college. In August 2021, the university announced the creation of the Oklahoma Aerospace Institute for Research and Education (OAIRE).

==Admissions==
For the class of 2023 (enrolling Fall 2019), OSU received 15,277 applications and accepted 10,691 (70.0%), with 4,200 enrolling. The middle 50% range of SAT scores for enrolling freshmen was 530–635 for evidence-based reading and writing, 510–630 for math, and 1040–1255 for the composite. The middle 50% ACT score range was 19–27 for math, 21–27 for English, and 21–28 for the composite.

==Rankings and reputation==

==Student life==
===Housing===
Current university-owned housing options include 31 residence halls, more than 15 dining options, and six family-first apartment complexes. In recent years, on-campus housing has been undergoing significant transformation. Student living was previously dominated by traditional residence halls; however, apartment-style buildings now comprise approximately half of the living quarters. In 2005, the high-rise Willham North and South residence halls that once dominated the Stillwater skyline were demolished and replaced with the Village suites on its site. Iba Hall, another traditional hall, was closed in 2007 but was reopened in 2011 due to an increase of incoming freshman. In 2017, Iba Hall underwent significant renovations which lasted through most of that year, before reopening in time for the Fall 2018 semester.

Iba, Parker, Wentz, and Stout Halls continue to offer traditional residence hall accommodations. In addition, three residence halls were opened in the fall of 2015, collectively known as the University Commons. North houses female students, south houses male students, and West is a co-ed facility that also houses the twenty-four-hour service desk for the area. Kerr-Drummond was slated to be closed with the opening of the University Commons, however Drummond was temporarily kept open in fall 2015 due to increased occupancy of campus housing while Kerr was closed. Drummond was then closed in 2018 due to facility issues. Kerr-Drummond is planned to be demolished sometime after Fall 2024. Apartments for single students are Bost, Davis, Morsani-Smith, Peterson-Friend, Kamm, Sitlington, and Young Halls. Housing in suite-style accommodations are provided in the named Village CASNR (College of Agricultural Science and Natural Resources), Village HS (Human Sciences), Village C, Village D, Village E and Village F. Deluxe suites are provided in Patchin &amp; Jones, Bennett, Zink &amp; Allen, and Stinchcomb &amp; Booker Halls. Graduate students and families are offered accommodations in seven apartments &quot;neighborhoods&quot; with a variety of floor plans and amenities: Brumley, Demaree, Prosser, Stevens, West, and Williams.

===Wrestling===

The Cowboy wrestling team brought home their 33rd NCAA championship in spring 2005, scoring the most points ever by an Oklahoma State wrestling team in the NCAA. OSU won their 34th overall (and 4th consecutive) title in 2006. OSU&#x27;s 34 team titles are the most ever collected by a school in one sport. The Cowboys have also produced 143 individual national champions, including the sport&#x27;s first-ever four-time champion, Pat Smith.

===Other sports===
Since the 1924 Olympics, 68 Oklahoma State University Olympians have won a total of 31 medals: 20 gold, four silver, and seven bronze.

<doc id="323080" wikidata="Q41070" url="?curid=323080" title="South Chungcheong Province">
<text>South Chungcheong Province (), informally called Chungnam, is a province of South Korea in the Hoseo region in the southwest of the Korean Peninsula. South Chungcheong borders the provinces of Gyeonggi to the north, North Chungcheong, Sejong Special Self-governing City, and Daejeon Metropolitan City to the east, and North Jeolla to the south.

Hongseong County is the capital and Cheonan is the largest city of South Chungcheong, with other major cities including Asan, Seosan, and Dangjin. Daejeon was the largest city of South Chungcheong until becoming a Metropolitan City in 1989, and the historic capital until the provincial government was relocated to Hongseong in 2012.

South Chungcheong was established in 1896 from the province of Chungcheong, one of the Eight Provinces of Korea, consisting of the southwestern half of the territory. South Chungcheong was known as Chūsei-nan Prefecture during the Japanese Colonial Period from 1910 and became part of South Korea following the division of Korea in 1945.

==Overview==
Chungcheongnam-do is South Korea&#x27;s richest province, with a 2012 GDP per capita of $56,133. It is by far South Korea&#x27;s fastest growing region, with an average GDP growth of 9.7% in 2001-2007 that accelerated to 12.4% in 2010. Such rapid growth transformed it from a mostly agricultural to a highly industrialized economy in the 21st century.

Along with Gangwon, Chungnam is the only province outside the Seoul Capital Area to be served by the Seoul Metropolitan Subway, with Seoul Subway Line 1 passing Cheonan and Asan. Multimillion-dollar projects are being developed, such as New Asan City centered on the newly built Cheonan-Asan Station that connects Chungnam&#x27;s largest city, Cheonan, to Seoul Station in less than 30 minutes via the KTX bullet train.

The area code of the province is 041.

==Demographics==


==Geography==
The province is part of the Hoseo region, and is bounded to the west by the Yellow Sea, to the north by Gyeonggi-do province, to the south by Jeollabuk-do province, and to the east by Chungcheongbuk-do province. Its area is as of 2012.

==Resources==
One third of the province&#x27;s area is under cultivation. Aside from agriculture, marine products are of importance. There are of exposed beach which is used to produce salt by solar evaporation. There is coal mining, but gold and silver mines are also found in Chungcheongnam-do, as is Monazite (a rare thorium bearing mineral) and zircon.

In 2018, South Chungcheong province was home to half of South Korea&#x27;s coal-fired power generation capacity. That year, it became the first Asian member of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, and committed to ending the use of coal power to mitigate global warming and reduce air pollution.

==Attractions==
At 845 metres, Mount Gyeryong is the most notable elevation. It is located in a national park which is noted for its unique rock features. Apart from the stone formations there are a number of old temples. These include Gwanchok-sa, a temple which is home to the largest stone Buddha in Korea. In 1978 the &quot;Taean Marine National Park&quot; was opened. It includes some of the country&#x27;s best bathing beaches, and Cheollipo Arboretum which was created in 1966 by C. Ferris Miller and contains approximately 14,000 different plant species, including some rare and endangered species.

==Sejong City==
In early 2007, the Republic of Korea government decided to create a special administrative district out of part of the present Chungcheongnam-do Province, near what is now Daejeon. The new district was named Sejong Special Self-Governing City, and was to replace Seoul as the future capital of the Republic of Korea. However, in 2009, it was determined that replacing Seoul as new national capital would violate the South Korean Constitution by Constitution Court. Now Sejong City may only serve as a National Administrative Capital and Secondary capital alongside Seoul, representing about 36 government ministers and agencies, including the Prime Minister&#x27;s office, as of 2015.

==Administrative divisions==

Chungcheongnam-do is divided into 8 cities (&quot;si&quot;) and 7 counties (&quot;gun&quot;). The city and county names below are given in English, Hangul, and Hanja.


==Religion==

According to the 2015 census, 13.8% of the population follows Buddhism and 26.8% follow Christianity (20.7% Protestantism and 6.1% Catholicism). 58.6% of the population is not religious and 0.8% of the population follows other religions.

<text>Sir Paweł Edmund Strzelecki (; 20 July 17976 October 1873), also known as Paul Edmund de Strzelecki and Sir Paul Strzelecki, was a Polish explorer, geologist, humanitarian, environmentalist, nobleman, scientist, businessman and philanthropist who in 1845 also became a British subject. 

He is noted for his contributions to the exploration of Australia, particularly the Snowy Mountains and Tasmania, and for climbing and naming the highest – – mountain on the continent, Mount Kosciuszko.

==Early years==
Strzelecki was born in 1797, in Głuszyna near Poznań (Posen), in the Polish territory occupied by the Kingdom of Prussia. He was the third child of Franciszek Strzelecki and Anna née Raczyńska, both from Polish nobility (szlachta), who leased the Głuszyna estate at the time. In Australia, Strzelecki was referred to as Count though there is no proof that he actually approved or used such a title himself.

As Poznań was then under Prussian control, Strzelecki was a Prussian citizen. He left school without matriculating, then served briefly in the Prussian Army in the 6th Regiment of Thuringian Uhlans, at the time known as the Polish Regiment because the majority of the staff were Poles. Strzelecki submitted his resignation due to the strict Prussian discipline that he did not approve of. There are some suggestions that he deserted the Regiment but in the official history of the Regiment the name Strzelecki does not appear. Not long after, he became a tutor at a manor of local nobility. He fell in love with his young student, a girl of 15, Aleksandryn (Adyna) Turno, but was rejected as a suitor by her father, Adam Turno. There are stories that Strzelecki attempted unsuccessfully to elope with Adyna, but biographers find this unlikely. Adyna and Strzelecki exchanged letters over 40 years but they never married. Provided with funds by his family, Strzelecki travelled in Austria and Italy. He eventually came under the notice of the Polish Prince Franciszek Sapieha who placed him in charge of his large estate in the Russian-occupied part of Poland. Strzelecki was then about 26 years of age and carried out his duties very successfully. Some years later the prince died, and a dispute arose between his son and heir, Eustace, and Strzelecki. Eustace refused to pay Strzelecki the prince&#x27;s bequest – a huge sum of money and a considerable estate – accusing him of bad faith and prevarication. After four years the dispute was settled. Strzelecki left Poland about 1829 and stayed some time in France, from where he travelled to Africa.

He had no formal training in geology, a science then in its infancy in England, but was probably, like his English contemporaries, self taught.

On 8 June 1834, he sailed from Liverpool to New York. He travelled widely in North America, analysing soil, examining minerals (tradition claims he discovered copper in Canada), and visiting farms to study soil conservation and to analyse the gluten content of wheat. In South America in 1836 he visited the most important mineral areas and he went up the west coast from Chile to California. During this time he became a strong opponent of the slave trade. He went to Cuba, Tahiti and the South Sea Islands, and came to New Zealand probably about the beginning of 1839.

==Australia==

He arrived at Sydney on 25 April 1839. He visited the estate of his friend James Macarthur at Camden. He wrote about meeting the German vintners that the Macarthurs had brought to Australia from the Rheingau region. He wrote: &quot;I had gone with my host to look at the farm, the fields, and the vineyard, — contiguous to which last stood in a row six neat cottages, surrounded with kitchen gardens, and inhabited by six families of German vine-dressers, who emigrated two years ago to New South Wales, either driven there by necessity, or seduced by the hope of finding, beyond the sea, fortune, peace, and happiness, – perhaps justice and liberty. The German salutation which I gave to the group that stood nearest, was like some signal-bell, which instantly set the whole colony in motion. Fathers, mothers, and children came running from all sides to see, to salute, and to talk to the gentleman who came from Germany. They took me for their fellow-countryman, and were happy, questioning me about Germany, the Rhine, and their native town. I was far from undeceiving them.&quot;

His main interest was the mineralogy of Australia. In September he discovered gold and silver near Wellington (NSW) and in the Vale of Clwyd, in the vicinity of Hartley. He collected there numerous samples of Australian gold, which were sent to the eminent geologist Sir Roderick Murchison of London, and also to Berlin, but the Governor of New South Wales, Sir George Gipps, fearing unrest among 45,000 convicts, stifled the news about the discovery.

Later in 1839 Strzelecki set out on an expedition into the Australian Alps and explored the Snowy Mountains with James Macarthur, James Riley and two Aboriginal guides: Charlie Tarra and Jackey. In 1840 he climbed the highest peak on mainland Australia and named it Mount Kosciuszko, to honour Tadeusz Kościuszko, one of the national heroes of Poland and a hero of the American Revolutionary War. On Victorian maps (but never on New South Wales maps) the name Mount Kosciusko was erroneously connected to the neighbouring peak, at present known as Mount Townsend and causing later many confusions, including the recent incorrect information on swapping the names of the mountains. From there Strzelecki explored Gippsland which he named after the governor. After passing the La Trobe River it was found necessary to abandon the horses and all the specimens that had been collected and try to reach Western Port. For 22 days they were on the edge of starvation and were ultimately saved by the knowledge and hunting ability of their guide Charlie, who caught native animals for them to eat. The party, practically exhausted, arrived at Western Port on 12 May 1840 and reached Melbourne on 28 May. The Strzelecki Ranges are named in his honour.

From 1840 to 1842, based in Launceston, Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen&#x27;s Land), Strzelecki explored nearly every part of the island, usually on foot with three men and two pack horses. His friends, the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir John Franklin, and his wife, Lady Jane, afforded him every help in his scientific endeavours.

Strzelecki left Tasmania on 29 September 1842 by steamer and arrived in Sydney on 2 October. He was collecting specimens in northern New South Wales towards the end of that year, and on 22 April 1843, he left Sydney after having travelled through New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, examining the geology along the way. He went to England after visiting China, the East Indies and Egypt.

In 1845 he published his &quot;Physical Description of New South Wales and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot;. The book gained the praise of Charles Darwin and other scientists and was awarded the Founder&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society. It was an unsurpassed source of knowledge on Australia for at least forty-five years. In it, he describes terra nullius as a &quot;sophistry of law&quot; and writes that Aboriginal Australians are &quot;as strongly attached to... property, and the rights which it involves, as any European political body.&quot; He also published the first map of Gippsland and its description which helped to open up this fertile part of Victoria. He produced the first large geological map of Eastern Australia and Tasmania.

In 1845 he became a naturalised British subject.

==Philanthropy==

During the autumn and winter of 1846–47 the disaster of the great famine came to Ireland. In January 1847, a group of English banking leaders combined to raise funds for famine relief via a private charity named the “British Relief Association” and entrusted Strzelecki to dispense them (£500,000). Strzelecki was appointed the main agent of the Association to superintend the distribution of supplies in County Sligo, County Mayo and County Donegal. In order to alleviate the critical situation of famished Irish families and especially children, Strzelecki developed a visionary and exceptionally effective mode of assistance: feeding starving children directly through the schools. He extended daily food rations to schoolchildren across the most famine-stricken western part of Ireland, while also distributing clothing and promoting basic hygiene. At its peak in 1848, around 200,000 children from all denominations were being fed through the efforts of the B.R.A., many of whom would have otherwise perished from hunger and disease. Despite suffering from the effects of typhoid fever he contracted in Ireland, Strzelecki dedicated himself tirelessly to hunger relief. His commitment was widely recognized and praised by his contemporaries. In recognition of his services, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in November 1848.

Strzelecki helped impoverished Irish families to seek new lives in Australia. He was, for many years, an active member of Family Colonisation Loan Society, originated by Caroline Chisholm and in 1854 was its chairman, fulfilling his duties with great zeal.

He was also an esteemed member of Lord Herbert&#x27;s Emigration Committee and of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Emigration Committee. He was, additionally, a member of the Crimean Army Fund Committee. At the end of the Crimean campaign he accompanied Lord Lyons on a visit to Sevastopol. Strzelecki was also associated with Florence Nightingale and helped her in facilitating the publication of a series of her articles.

He died of liver cancer in London in 1873 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. In 1997 his remains were transferred to the crypt of merit at the Church of St. Adalbert in his hometown of Poznań, Poland.

==Awards and honours==
Strzelecki was made a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and was awarded its Founder&#x27;s Medal for &quot;exploration in the south eastern portion of Australia&quot;. The Society still displays his huge geological map of New South Wales and Tasmania for public viewing.

He was also appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society, having gained widespread recognition as an explorer and philanthropist.

He was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law from the University of Oxford, appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1849, and appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1869.

In 1983 he was honoured on a postage stamp depicting his portrait issued by Australia Post.

In 2023, the city of Poznań declared 2023 as &quot;The Year of Strzelecki&quot; in order to honour and celebrate the life of the explorer and his accomplishments.

<text>Cytochrome &quot;c&quot; peroxidase, or CCP, is a water-soluble heme-containing enzyme of the peroxidase family that takes reducing equivalents from cytochrome &quot;c&quot; and reduces hydrogen peroxide to water:

:CCP + H2O2 + 2 ferrocytochrome &quot;c&quot; + 2H+ → CCP + 2H2O + 2 ferricytochrome &quot;c&quot;

CCP can be derived from aerobically grown yeast strains and can be isolated in both native and recombinant forms with high yield from &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae.&quot; The enzyme’s primary function is to eliminate toxic radical molecules produced by the cell which are harmful to biological systems. It works to maintain low concentration levels of hydrogen peroxide, which is generated by the organism naturally through incomplete oxygen reduction. When glucose levels in fast growing yeast strains are exhausted, the cells turn to respiration which raises the concentration of mitochondrial H2O2. In addition to its peroxidase activity, it acts as a sensor and a signaling molecule to exogenous H2O2, which activates mitochondrial catalase activity. In eukaryotes, CCP contain a mono-&quot;b&quot;-type haem cofactor and is targeted to the intermembrane space of the mitochondria. In prokaryotes, CCP contains a &quot;c-&quot;type diheme cofactor and is localized to the periplasm of the cell. Both enzymes work to resist peroxide-induced cellular stress.

CCP plays an integral role in enabling inter-protein biological electron transfer. The negative charge transfer process is carried out by a complex formed between cytochrome c and cytochrome c peroxidase which occurs in the inter-membrane space of mitochondria. The mechanism involves ferrous cytochrome &quot;c&quot; (Cc) providing electrons for the Cc-CcP system to reduce hydrogen peroxide to water. The complex is formed by non-covalent interactions.

Cytochrome &quot;c&quot; peroxidase can react with hydroperoxides other than hydrogen peroxide, but the reaction rate is much slower than with hydrogen peroxide.

It was first isolated from baker&#x27;s yeast by R. A. Altschul, Abrams, and Hogness in 1940, though not to purity. The first purified preparation of yeast CCP dates to Takashi Yonetani and his preparation by ion exchange chromatography in the early 1960s. The X-ray structure was the work of Thomas Poulos and coworkers in the late 1970s. CCP is the first heme enzyme to have its structure successfully solved through X-ray crystallography.

The yeast enzyme is a monomer of molecular weight 34,000, containing 293 amino acids, and contains as well a single non-covalently bound heme &quot;b&quot;. It is negatively charged and is a moderately-sized enzyme (34.2 kDa). The apoenzyme, not active and bound to substrates, has an acidic isoelectric point of pH 5.0-5.2. Unusual for proteins, this enzyme crystallizes when dialysed against distilled water. More so, the enzyme purifies as a consequence of crystallization, making cycles of crystallization an effective final purification step.

Much like catalase, the reaction of cytochrome &quot;c&quot; peroxidase proceeds through a three-step process, forming first a Compound I and then a Compound II intermediate:

: CCP + ROOH → Compound I + ROH + H2O
: CCP-compound I + e− + H+ → Compound II
: Compound II + e− + H+ → CCP
CCP in the resting state has a ferric heme, and, after the addition of two oxidizing equivalents from a hydroperoxide (usually hydrogen peroxide), it becomes oxidised to a formal oxidation state of +5 (FeV, commonly referred to as ferryl heme. However, both low-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements and Mössbauer spectroscopy show that the iron in Compound I of CCP is a +4 ferryl iron, with the second oxidising equivalent existing as a long-lived free-radical on the side-chain of the tryptophan residue (Trp-191). In its resting state, the Fe atom (Fe (III)) in the CCP heme is paramagnetic with high spin (S= 5/2). Once the catalytic cycle is initiated, the iron atom is oxidized to form an oxyferryl intermediate (Fe(IV)=O) has low spin (S= 1/2). This is different from most peroxidases, which have the second oxidising equivalent on the porphyrin instead. Compound I of CCP is fairly long-lived, decaying to CCP-compound II with a half-life at room temperature of 40 minutes to a couple hours.

CCP has high sequence identity to the closely related ascorbate peroxidase enzyme.

== Amino acid composition ==

Amino acid analyzer studies reveal presence of residues of Asp, Thr, Ser, Glu, Pro, Gly, Ala, Val, Met, Ile, Leu, Tyr, Phe, Lys, His, Arg, Cys, and Trp in crystalline CCP. The enzyme shows an unusual amino acid pattern compared to other peroxidase. Plant peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase and pineapple peroxidase B have low lysine, tryptophan, and tyrosine contents and high cysteine content. In contrast, CCP has high lysine, tryptophan, and tyrosine content and low cysteine content. The enzyme contains a 68-residue sequence at the N-terminus of its monomeric protein, which targets it to the inter-membrane space of the mitochondria where it can the complex with cytochrome &quot;c&quot; and where it carries out its sensor, signaling and catalytic roles. Studies indicate the distal arginine (Arg48), a highly conserved amino acid among peroxidase, plays an important role in the catalytic activity of CCP by controlling its active site through stabilization of the reactive oxyferryl intermediate from control of its access.
