<text>A steel-toe boot (also known as a safety boot, steel-capped boot, steel toecaps or safety shoe) is a durable boot or shoe that has a protective reinforcement in the toe which protects the foot from falling objects or compression. Safety shoes are effective in keeping the feet of industrial workers safe from sharp and heavy objects while working in factories.

Safety footwear now comes in many styles, including sneakers, clogs, and dress shoes. Some are quite formal, for supervising engineers who must visit sites where protective footwear is mandatory.

Some brands of steel-toe footwear have become fashionable within subcultures such as skinhead, punk, and rivethead. While brands that were previously renowned within the fashion industry have also diversified into the safety footwear market, industrial brands like Caterpillar, Rock Fall and JCB have also issued licenses to produce safety footwear.

== Safety boot ==
Safety boots are used by tradespeople to protect from environmental hazards at a jobsite. They may also be used for outdoor recreational activities or sports such as off-roading, overlanding or woodchopping. Common protections include steel/reinforced toe, metatarsal guard, penetration-resistant (steel plate in mid-sole), electrical hazard (EH), chemical resistance and waterproofing. Modern safety boots are usually laced with a vertical side zipper under a hook-and-loop strap.

== Safety criteria ==

=== Asia ===
Safety shoe standards in Asia are:
* China: GB 21148 &amp; An1, An2, An3, An4, An5
* Indonesia: SNI 0111:2009
* Japan: JIS T8101
* Malaysia: SIRIM MA 1598:1998
* Singapore: SS 513-1:2005
* India: IS 15298-I: 2011 test methods, IS 15298–II for safety footwear, IS 15298-III Protective footwear, IS 15298-IV Occupational Footwear
* Thailand: TIS 523-2011
=== Europe ===

The International Organization for Standardization provides the European standard for safety footwear. The current one is ISO 20345:2011 - previously ISO 20345:2004.

The codes applicable to European safety footwear are:

There is also Previous EN ISO 20346:2004 and Now the latest one is EN ISO 20346:2021 for protective footwear (must comply to basic safety requirements but toe cap impact resistance requirement is lower - 100 Joules) &amp; EN ISO 20347:2004 for Occupational Footwear (must comply to basic safety requirements with antistatic or slip-resistant properties. This standard does not require a protective toe cap)

===North America===

====Canada====
In Canada, the most common standards used by employers are those of the CSA Group (formerly the Canadian Standards Association; CSA), published in CSA standard Z195. These standards are similar to the ASTM International standards commonly used in the United States but the testing methods do vary.

CSA standards on shoe labels feature distinct shapes and colors, represents specific safety criteria for all safety footwear and apparel:
* Green triangle with registered symbol - Sole puncture protection with a Grade 1 protective toe. (Heavy work environment: construction; machine shops; where sharp objects are present)
* Yellow triangle with registered symbol - Sole puncture protection with a Grade 2 protective toe. (Light industrial work environments)
* White rectangle with orange Greek letter omega and registered symbol - Soles that provide electric shock resistance, with Ω (capital omega) being the symbol for ohms of electrical resistance. (Any industrial environment where live electrical conductors can occur)
* Yellow rectangle with green letters &quot;SD&quot;, a grounding symbol and registered symbol - Capable of dissipating an electrostatic charge in a controlled manner. (Any industrial environment where a static discharge can be a hazard for workers or equipment)
* Red rectangle with a black letter C, grounding symbol and registered symbol - Soles that are electrically conductive. (Any industrial environment where low-power electrical charges can be a hazard for workers or equipment)
* White label with green fir tree symbol and registered symbol - Provides protection when using chainsaws. (Forestry workers and others required to use a chainsaw)
* Blue Square with registered symbol - Grade 1 protective toe only. (For all other environments not listed above)
The registered symbol in each of the CSA Z195 protective footwear markings is a registered identifying logo or mark of the certifying agency. Examples of organizations that certify footwear to this standard include the Safety Equipment Institute (SEI), the CSA Group, and UL Solutions.

Generally, a safety shoe is a shoe that follows at least one of five criteria. The criteria that a safety shoe adheres to can be found by looking for the CSA (Canadian Standards Association) alphanumeric code found inside the shoe. This code is made up of a combination of 5 different symbols:
* 1, 2 or 0;
* P or 0;
* M or 0;
* E, S or C;
* X or 0.

# The first code indicates whether the shoe has a steel-toe cap (a metal shell embedded on top of the toes part of the shoe). &quot;0&quot; means there is none. &quot;1&quot; means that there is, and it resists an impact of 125 joules (22.7 kg object falling from 56 cm above). &quot;2&quot; means that it resists an impact of 90 joules.
# The second code indicates whether the shoe has soles that protect the arches of the feet from punctures. &quot;P&quot; means it does. &quot;O&quot; means it doesn&#x27;t.
# The third code indicates whether the shoe has a metatarsus protection against shocks and collisions. &quot;M&quot; means it does. &quot;O&quot; doesn&#x27;t.
# The fourth code indicates the shoe&#x27;s electrical properties. &quot;E&quot; means it resists electrical shocks. &quot;S&quot; means it disperses static electrical. &quot;C&quot; means it conducts electricity.
# This last code is found only on shoes that protect the foot from chainsaws, i.e. chainsaw boots. &quot;X&quot; it does, &quot;O&quot; does not.

====United States====
In the United States, the most common standards used by employers for protective footwear are ASTM International standards F2412-18a (Standard Test Methods for Foot Protection) and ASTM F2413-18 (Standard Specification for Performance Requirements for Foot Protection).

OSHA previously required compliance of ANSI Z41.1-1991, &quot;American National Standard for Personal Protection-Protective Footwear,&quot; if purchased after July 5, 1994, or ANSI standard &quot;USA Standard for Men&#x27;s Safety-Toe Footwear,&quot; Z41.1-1967, if purchased before that date.

As of March 1, 2005, ANSI Z41 has been replaced by ASTM F2412 and ASTM F2413

ASTM certified footwear must include a label that indicates which safety standards that particular footwear meets. The various safety standards include:
* I - Impact
* C - Compression
* Mt - Metatarsal
* Cd - Conductive
* EH - Electrical Hazard
* SD - Static Dissipating
* PR - Puncture Resistant

<text>Reichelsheim is a town in the district Wetteraukreis, in Hesse, Germany. It is located 30 kilometers north of Frankfurt am Main.

== Division of the town ==
Reichelsheim consists of the 6 districts:
* Beienheim (population 1,570)
* Blofeld (population 476)
* Dorn-Assenheim (population 1,228)
* Heuchelheim (population 444)
* Reichelsheim (population 1,946)
* Weckesheim (population 1,077)
The total population is 6,741 (population as of 2003).

== History ==
The oldest parts are Beienheim (first mentioned in a document from the year 773) and Reichelsheim (817).

The town of Reichelsheim was created in 1972 during an extensive land reform. The formerly independent villages mentioned above joined administrative structures now concentrated in the largest of the villages, Reichelsheim.

The area which is now the town of Reichelsheim was probably already populated in Celtic times. During the fourth century BC the Celts were slowly displaced by Germanic tribes that later had to yield to Roman rule which forced all of the Wetterau under its control.

In the 6th century Frankish rule was established. The name-ending &quot;-heim&quot; is of Frankish origin, meaning quite literally &quot;home of&quot;. In the case of the village of Reichelsheim, it was supposedly a frankish settler named Richholf who founded the village that was first mentioned as &quot;Richolfsheim&quot;.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the town was repeatedly plundered and burned to the ground.

The village gained town status in the year 1665.

==Mayors==
Since 2020 Lena Herget-Umsonst has been the mayor of Reichelsheim. Previous mayors were: 
*2008–2020: Bertin Bischofsberger (CDU)
*1985–2008: Gerd Wagner (SPD)

<doc id="332213" wikidata="Q897827" url="?curid=332213" title="Z-test">
<text>A &quot;Z&quot;-test is any statistical test for which the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis can be approximated by a normal distribution. Z-test tests the mean of a distribution. For each significance level in the confidence interval, the &quot;Z&quot;-test has a single critical value (for example, 1.96 for 5% two tailed) which makes it more convenient than the Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test whose critical values are defined by the sample size (through the corresponding degrees of freedom). Both the Z-test and Student&#x27;s t-test have similarities in that they both help determine the significance of a set of data. However, the z-test is rarely used in practice because the population deviation is difficult to determine.

==Applicability==
Because of the central limit theorem, many test statistics are approximately normally distributed for large samples. Therefore, many statistical tests can be conveniently performed as approximate &quot;Z&quot;-tests if the sample size is large or the population variance is known. If the population variance is unknown (and therefore has to be estimated from the sample itself) and the sample size is not large (&quot;n&quot; &lt; 30), the Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test may be more appropriate (in some cases, &quot;n&quot; &lt; 50, as described below).

==Procedure==
How to perform a Z test when &quot;T&quot; is a statistic that is approximately normally distributed under the null hypothesis is as follows: 

First, estimate the expected value μ of &quot;T&quot; under the null hypothesis, and obtain an estimate &quot;s&quot; of the standard deviation of &quot;T&quot;.

Second, determine the properties of &quot;T&quot; : one tailed or two tailed.

For Null hypothesis H&quot;0: μ≥μ&quot;0 vs alternative hypothesis H&quot;1: μ&lt;μ&quot;0 , it is lower/left-tailed (one tailed).

For Null hypothesis H&quot;0: μ≤μ&quot;0 vs alternative hypothesis H&quot;1: μ&gt;μ&quot;0 , it is upper/right-tailed (one tailed). 

For Null hypothesis H&quot;0: μ=μ&quot;0 vs alternative hypothesis H&quot;1: μ≠μ&quot;0 , it is two-tailed. 

Third, calculate the standard score: formula_1 which one-tailed and two-tailed &quot;p&quot;-values can be calculated as Φ(&quot;Z&quot;)(for lower/left-tailed tests), Φ(−&quot;Z&quot;) (for upper/right-tailed tests) and 2Φ(−|&quot;Z&quot;|) (for two-tailed tests) where Φ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.

==Use in location testing==

# The term &quot;&quot;Z&quot;-test&quot; is often used to refer specifically to the one-sample location test comparing the mean of a set of measurements to a given constant when the sample variance is known. For example, if the observed data &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;n are (i) independent, (ii) have a common mean μ, and (iii) have a common variance σ2, then the sample average &quot;X&quot; has mean μ and variance formula_2. 
# The null hypothesis is that the mean value of X is a given number μ0. We can use &quot;X&quot;  as a test-statistic, rejecting the null hypothesis if &quot;X&quot; − μ0 is large. 
# To calculate the standardized statistic formula_3, we need to either know or have an approximate value for σ2, from which we can calculate formula_4 . In some applications, σ2 is known, but this is uncommon. 
# If the sample size is moderate or large, we can substitute the sample variance for σ2, giving a &quot;plug-in&quot; test. The resulting test will not be an exact &quot;Z&quot;-test since the uncertainty in the sample variance is not accounted for—however, it will be a good approximation unless the sample size is small. 
# A &quot;t&quot;-test can be used to account for the uncertainty in the sample variance when the data are exactly normal. 
# Difference between Z-test and t-test: Z-test is used when sample size is large (n&gt;50), or the population variance is known. t-test is used when sample size is small (n&lt;50) and population variance is unknown. 
# There is no universal constant at which the sample size is generally considered large enough to justify use of the plug-in test. Typical rules of thumb: the sample size should be 50 observations or more. 
# For large sample sizes, the &quot;t&quot;-test procedure gives almost identical &quot;p&quot;-values as the &quot;Z&quot;-test procedure. 
# Other location tests that can be performed as &quot;Z&quot;-tests are the two-sample location test and the paired difference test.

== Conditions ==

For the &quot;Z&quot;-test to be applicable, certain conditions must be met.

* Nuisance parameters should be known, or estimated with high accuracy (an example of a nuisance parameter would be the standard deviation in a one-sample location test). &quot;Z&quot;-tests focus on a single parameter, and treat all other unknown parameters as being fixed at their true values. In practice, due to Slutsky&#x27;s theorem, &quot;plugging in&quot; consistent estimates of nuisance parameters can be justified. However, if the sample size is not large enough for these estimates to be reasonably accurate, the &quot;Z&quot;-test may not perform well.
* The test statistic should follow a normal distribution. Generally, one appeals to the central limit theorem to justify assuming that a test statistic varies normally. There is a great deal of statistical research on the question of when a test statistic varies approximately normally. If the variation of the test statistic is strongly non-normal, a &quot;Z&quot;-test should not be used.

If estimates of nuisance parameters are plugged in as discussed above, it is important to use estimates appropriate for the way the data were sampled. In the special case of &quot;Z&quot;-tests for the one or two sample location problem, the usual sample standard deviation is only appropriate if the data were collected as an independent sample.

In some situations, it is possible to devise a test that properly accounts for the variation in plug-in estimates of nuisance parameters. In the case of one and two sample location problems, a &quot;t&quot;-test does this.

== Example ==

Suppose that in a particular geographic region, the mean and standard deviation of scores on a reading test are 100 points, and 12 points, respectively. Our interest is in the scores of 55 students in a particular school who received a mean score of 96. We can ask whether this mean score is significantly lower than the regional mean—that is, are the students in this school comparable to a simple random sample of 55 students from the region as a whole, or are their scores surprisingly low?

First calculate the standard error of the mean:

:formula_5

where formula_6 is the population standard deviation.

Next calculate the &quot;z&quot;-score, which is the distance from the sample mean to the population mean in units of the standard error:

:formula_7

In this example, we treat the population mean and variance as known, which would be appropriate if all students in the region were tested. When population parameters are unknown, a Student&#x27;s t-test should be conducted instead.

The classroom mean score is 96, which is −2.47 standard error units from the population mean of 100. Looking up the &quot;z&quot;-score in a table of the standard normal distribution cumulative probability, we find that the probability of observing a standard normal value below −2.47 is approximately 0.5 − 0.4932 = 0.0068. This is the one-sided &quot;p&quot;-value for the null hypothesis that the 55 students are comparable to a simple random sample from the population of all test-takers. The two-sided &quot;p&quot;-value is approximately 0.014 (twice the one-sided &quot;p&quot;-value).

Another way of stating things is that with probability 1 − 0.014 = 0.986, a simple random sample of 55 students would have a mean test score within 4 units of the population mean. We could also say that with 98.6% confidence we reject the null hypothesis that the 55 test takers are comparable to a simple random sample from the population of test-takers.

The &quot;Z&quot;-test tells us that the 55 students of interest have an unusually low mean test score compared to most simple random samples of similar size from the population of test-takers. A deficiency of this analysis is that it does not consider whether the effect size of 4 points is meaningful. If instead of a classroom, we considered a subregion containing 900 students whose mean score was 99, nearly the same &quot;z&quot;-score and &quot;p&quot;-value would be observed. This shows that if the sample size is large enough, very small differences from the null value can be highly statistically significant. See statistical hypothesis testing for further discussion of this issue.

== Occurrence and applications ==
=== For maximum likelihood estimation of a parameter ===
Location tests are the most familiar &quot;Z&quot;-tests. Another class of &quot;Z&quot;-tests arises in maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters in a parametric statistical model. Maximum likelihood estimates are approximately normal under certain conditions, and their asymptotic variance can be calculated in terms of the Fisher information. The maximum likelihood estimate divided by its standard error can be used as a test statistic for the null hypothesis that the population value of the parameter equals zero. More generally, if formula_8 is the maximum likelihood estimate of a parameter θ, and θ0 is the value of θ under the null hypothesis,
:formula_9

Where:
* formula_10 = sample proportion in the first sample
* formula_11 = sample proportion in the second sample
* formula_12 = size of the first sample
* formula_13 = size of the second sample
* formula_14 = pooled proportion, calculated as formula_15, where formula_16 and formula_17 are the counts of successes in the two samples.

The confidence interval for the difference between two proportions, based on the definitions above, is:

formula_18

Where:
* formula_19 is the critical value of the standard normal distribution (e.g., 1.96 for a 95% confidence level).

The MDE for when using the (two-sided) z-test formula for comparing two proportions, incorporating critical values for formula_20 and formula_21, and the standard errors of the proportions:

formula_22

Where:
* formula_23: Critical value for the significance level.
* formula_24: Quantile for the desired power.
* formula_25: When assuming the null is correct.

<text>George Henry Hubert Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood (7 February 1923 – 11 July 2011), styled The Honourable George Lascelles before 1929 and Viscount Lascelles between 1929 and 1947, was a British classical music administrator and author, and a member of the extended British Royal Family, as a maternal grandson of King George V and Queen Mary, and thus a first-cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. He served as director of the Royal Opera House (1951–1953; 1969–1972), chairman of the board of the English National Opera (ENO) (1986–1995); managing director of the ENO (1972–1985), managing director of the English National Opera North (1978–81), governor of the BBC (1985–1987), and president of the British Board of Film Classification (1985–1996).

Harewood was the elder son of the 6th Earl of Harewood and Princess Mary, Princess Royal, the only daughter of King George V and Queen Mary. At his birth, he was sixth in the line of succession; at his death, he was 46th. Lord Harewood was the eldest grandchild of King George V and Queen Mary, nephew of both King Edward VIII and King George VI and first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. He succeeded to his father&#x27;s earldom on 24 May 1947.

== Early life ==

George Lascelles was born at his parents&#x27; London home of Chesterfield House on 7 February 1923, the first child of Henry, Viscount Lascelles, and Princess Mary, Viscountess Lascelles, and first grandchild of King George V and Queen Mary, who stood as sponsors at his christening. The christening took place on 25 March 1923 at St Mary&#x27;s Church in the village of Goldsborough, near Knaresborough adjoining the family home Goldsborough Hall. After his paternal grandfather&#x27;s death in 1929, he was styled as Viscount Lascelles as his father succeeded to the earldom. He served as a Page of Honour at the coronation of his uncle King George VI in May 1937.

He was raised at Harewood House in Yorkshire. He was educated at Ludgrove School, Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. His time at university was interrupted by the Second World War.

==Military service==

Lascelles joined the British Army where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Grenadier Guards (his father&#x27;s regiment) in 1942, attaining the rank of captain. He fought with the 3rd Battalion of the regiment, part of the 1st Guards Brigade of the 78th Infantry Division (the brigade was later transferred to the 6th Armoured Division), serving in North Africa and Italy, but was wounded and captured at Monte Corno on 18 June 1944, the anniversary of both his father&#x27;s injury in the First World War and the Battle of Waterloo, in which his great-great-grandfather was injured.

He was held as a prisoner of war in Oflag IV-C (Colditz) until May 1945. As the nephew of King George VI, Lascelles was one of the &quot;Prominente&quot; at Colditz, considered a potential bargaining chip by the Nazis.

In March 1945, Adolf Hitler signed his death warrant; the SS general in command of prisoner-of-war camps, Gottlob Berger, realizing the war was lost, refused to carry out the sentence and released Lascelles to the Swiss.

In 1945–46, he served as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to his great uncle, Lord Athlone, who was then Governor General of Canada. Lord Harewood served as a Counsellor of State in 1947, 1953–54, and 1956.

==House of Lords==
Lascelles succeeded his father in 1947. On 7 February 1956, he took his seat in the House of Lords. He lost his seat in the Lords following the House of Lords Act of 1999, which excluded most hereditary peers from membership.

== Career ==

=== Opera ===
A music enthusiast, Lord Harewood devoted most of his career to opera with his Yorkshire heritage fostering his interest; in March 1949, as a young single man, he had been among the audience at the Leeds Town Hall for a performance of operatic works by the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra. By 1950, he had become patron of the orchestra&#x27;s concerts. He served as editor of &quot;Opera&quot; magazine from 1950 to 1953. In February 1950, it was reported that he had launched the magazine at a large party at the London house of Richard Buckle with many music-loving guests in attendance. He was director of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden from 1951 to 1953 and again from 1969 to 1972. He served as chairman of the board of the English National Opera (ENO) from 1986 to 1995; Managing Director of the ENO from 1972 to 1985 and was Artistic Director of both the Edinburgh and Adelaide Festivals. From 1958 to 1974, he was General/Artistic Director of the Leeds Triennial Musical Festival. He was Managing Director of the ENO offshoot English National Opera North from 1978 to 1981. Lord Harewood served as a governor of the BBC from 1985 to 1987 and as the president of the British Board of Film Classification from 1985 to 1996.

He was the author or editor of three books, &quot;Kobbé&#x27;s Complete Opera Book&quot; (ed. 1954, now &quot;The New Kobbé&#x27;s Opera Book&quot;, edited with Antony Peattie, latest ed. 1997; and &quot;The New Pocket Kobbé&#x27;s Opera Book&quot;, edited with his step-son Michael Shmith, 2000), &quot;The Tongs and the Bones&quot; (an autobiography, 1981), and &quot;Kobbé&#x27;s Illustrated Opera Book&quot; (ed. 1989). He was chairman of Historic Masters, an unusual vinyl record label dedicated to high-quality issues of rare historic 78 rpm recordings of opera singers. He was a noted friend and colleague of the late opera diva Maria Callas and is featured in the 1968 EMI documentary &quot;The Callas Conversations Vol. I&quot;, during which he interviewed Callas at length concerning her career and ideas about opera.

=== Football ===
His other interests included football: he served as president of Leeds United Football Club from 1961 until his death and was president of the Football Association from 1963 to 1972.

=== Public life ===
Lascelles was the only person to serve as Counsellor of State without being a Prince of the United Kingdom, serving from 1945 to 1951, then from 1952 to 1956. He served as chancellor of the University of York from 1962 to 1967. He was ranked number 1355 in the Sunday Times Rich List 2008 with an estimated wealth of £55 million—his magnificent art treasures, held in trust and valued at more than £50 million, and a estate outside Leeds. The estate and house, Harewood House, are held by a charity with £9 million of assets, and were not counted as part of his wealth.

== Honours ==
Queen Elizabeth II created him a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List on 13 June 1986. On 1 July 2010 he was appointed an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia (AM), &quot;for service to the arts in Australia and to supporting Australia&#x27;s artists in the United Kingdom&quot;.

In 1959, Harewood received the Grand Decoration in Silver with Sash for Services to the Republic of Austria.
== Personal life ==
===Marriages and children===
On 29 September 1949 at St. Mark&#x27;s Church, London, Lord Harewood married Marion Stein, a concert pianist and the daughter of the Viennese music publisher Erwin Stein. Because of Harewood&#x27;s position in the line of succession, the marriage was subject to approval from the sovereign, under the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Queen Mary, mother of George VI, objected to the marriage but permission was eventually granted. Benjamin Britten, a friend of the Stein family, composed an anthem, &quot;Amo Ergo Sum&quot;, for the wedding ceremony.

Lord and Lady Harewood had three sons:

* David Henry George Lascelles, 8th Earl of Harewood, born 21 October 1950. He married Margaret Messenger on 12 February 1979; they were divorced in 1989. They have four children and seven grandchildren. He married Diane Howse on 11 March 1990. 
* Hon James Edward Lascelles, born 5 October 1953. He married Fredericka Duhrrson on 4 April 1973; they were divorced in 1985. They have two children and one granddaughter. He married secondly Lori Lee on 4 May 1985; they were divorced in 1996. They have two children and one grandson. He married thirdly Joy Elias-Rilwan on 30 January 1999.
* Hon Robert Jeremy Hugh Lascelles, born 14 February 1955. He married Julie Bayliss on 4 July 1981; they were divorced. They have three children and five grandchildren. He married Catherine Bell on 7 January 1999. They have a daughter.

The earl&#x27;s marriage to Marion Stein ended in divorce in 1967, after the earl&#x27;s mistress, Patricia &quot;Bambi&quot; Tuckwell – an Australian violinist and sister of the musician Barry Tuckwell – gave birth to his son. This was considered an enormous scandal at the time, and caused the couple to be ostracised for some years, even after their relationship was made legal. Stein went on to marry politician Jeremy Thorpe.

Lord Harewood married Tuckwell (24 November 1926 – 4 May 2018) on 31 July 1967. The wedding took place at Waveny Park in New Canaan, Connecticut. They were obliged to be married abroad as, in England, registry office marriages were barred at the time for persons covered by the Royal Marriages Act, and divorcees could not marry in the Church of England. They had one son:

* Mark Hubert Lascelles, born 4 July 1964. He married, first, Andrea Kershaw (born 16 June 1964) on 8 August 1992 and divorced in 2005. They have three daughters. He married Judith Ann Kilburn on 16 July 2011. As of 1 September 2024, he is to be head teacher of Epsom College.

=== Death ===
Lord Harewood died peacefully at home, on 11 July 2011, aged 88 years. A private, but well-attended stately home funeral was held on 15 July.

<text>The Gobelins Manufactory () is a historic tapestry factory in Paris, France. It is located at 42 avenue des Gobelins, near Les Gobelins métro station in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. It was originally established on the site as a medieval dyeing business by the family Gobelin.
==Overview==
It is best known as a royal factory supplying the court of the French monarchs since Louis XIV, and it is now run by the &quot;General Administration of the National Furniture and National Manufactures of Carpets and Tapestries&quot; (French: &quot;Administration générale du Mobilier national et des Manufactures nationales de tapis et tapisseries&quot;) of the French Ministry of Culture. The factory is open for guided tours several afternoons per week by appointment, as well as for casual visits every day except Mondays and some specific holidays. The Galerie des Gobelins is dedicated to temporary exhibitions of tapestries from the French manufactures and furnitures from the Mobilier National, built in the gardens by Auguste Perret in 1937.
Along with Ōshima-tsumugi from Japan, and Persian carpets, Gobelin Tapestry are considered to be one of the worlds greatest textiles.

==History==
The Gobelins were a family of dyers who, in the middle of the 15th century, established themselves in the , Paris, on the banks of the Bièvre.

===Comans-La Planche workshop===
In 1602, Henry IV of France rented factory space from the Gobelins for his Flemish tapestry makers, Marc de Comans and François de la Planche, on the current location of the Gobelins Manufactory adjoining the Bièvre river. In 1629, their sons Charles de Comans and Raphaël de la Planche took over their fathers&#x27; tapestry workshops, and in 1633, Charles was the head of the Gobelins manufactory. Their partnership ended around 1650, and the workshops were split into two. Tapestries from this early, Flemish period are sometimes called &quot;pre-gobelins&quot;.

===Colbert and Le Brun ===

In 1662, the works in the Faubourg Saint Marcel, with the adjoining grounds, were purchased by Jean-Baptiste Colbert on behalf of Louis XIV and made into a general upholstery factory, in which designs both in tapestry and in all kinds of furniture were executed under the superintendence of the court painter, Charles Le Brun, who served as director and chief designer from 1663–1690. On account of Louis XIV&#x27;s financial problems, the establishment was closed in 1694, but reopened in 1697 for the manufacture of tapestry, chiefly for royal use. It rivalled the Beauvais tapestry works until the French Revolution, when work at the factory was suspended.

The factory was revived during the Bourbon Restoration and, in 1826, the manufacture of carpets was added to that of tapestry. In 1871, the building was partly burned down during the Paris Commune.

The factory is still in operation today as a state-run institution.

== Historical site ==
Today, the manufactory consists of a set of four irregular buildings dating to the seventeenth century, plus the building on the avenue des Gobelins built by Jean-Camille Formigé in 1912 after the 1871 fire. They contain Le Brun&#x27;s residence and workshops that served as foundries for most of the bronze statues in the park of Versailles, as well as looms on which tapestries are woven following seventeenth century techniques.

The Gobelins still produces some limited amount of tapestries for the decoration of French governmental institutions, with contemporary subjects.

The museum&#x27;s gallery reopened to the public on May 12, 2007. Important exhibitions are organized regularly.

==Fulham connection==
A branch of the manufactory was established in London probably in the early 18th-century in the area that is now Fulham High Street. Around 1753 it appears to have been taken over by the priest and adventurer, Pierre Parisot, but closed only a few years later.

<text>Roy Rothschild Neuberger (July 21, 1903 – December 24, 2010) was an American financier who contributed money to raise public awareness of modern art through his acquisition of pieces he deemed worthy. He was a co-founder of the investment firm Neuberger Berman. Roy Neuberger served for several decades as Honorary Trustee, Benefactor, and member of the Department of Modern Art&#x27;s Visiting Committee at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

==Biography==
Roy Rothschild Neuberger (unrelated to the famous Rothschild family) was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and spent his childhood in New York City. Born into a wealthy Jewish family, he was orphaned at the age of 12 after the deaths of his father Louis Neuberger, an immigrant from Germany and his mother, Bertha Rothschild, who was originally from Chicago.
 Neuberger described himself as having been interested during high school in tennis. He matriculated at New York University, originally to study journalism, but grew restless and dropped out without obtaining a degree.

His first job was working in the Manhattan department store B. Altman and Company. Among the things he practiced selling were paintings, which nurtured his love of art. He sailed to Europe at age 20 on an inheritance from his parents, and went to live in Paris. He enjoyed a bohemian lifestyle there, visiting the Louvre three times a week, where he met his lifelong friend, 20th-century art historian Meyer Schapiro.

Neuberger painted and studied art until 1928, when he read Florent Fels&#x27; biography of Vincent van Gogh. He was startled when he learned how Van Gogh had only sold one painting, and was heartstricken to learn that Van Gogh, like so many other artists, lived in pain, poverty and misery. Appalled that artwork was often only considered valuable after an artist&#x27;s death, Neuberger vowed to support living artists, claiming &quot;the contemporary world should buy the work of contemporary artists.&quot; Neuberger often purchased works from artists who were struggling financially, including Jackson Pollock, Willem DeKooning, and Mark Rothko, believing that the financial support would help the artists stay on their career track.

He moved back to the United States and entered Wall Street in 1929, seven months before Black Tuesday. He started out with Halle &amp; Stieglitz and sold short RCA shares, through the stock market crash and well into the Great Depression. He founded Neuberger Berman in 1939 with Robert Berman. In 1950, Neuberger&#x27;s firm started one of the first no-load mutual funds in the United States, the Guardian Fund, which is still in operation today.

===Art patron===
By 1939, Neuberger had made enough money to buy the first painting that he would lend out to promote the artist: Peter Hurd&#x27;s &quot;Boy from the Plains&quot;. He allowed Nelson Rockefeller, another avid art collector, to use &quot;Boy from the Plains&quot; in a travelling American art exhibition. Rockefeller&#x27;s exhibition travelled to South America, and many people in both South and North America were thus exposed to Hurd&#x27;s art.

Among the other artists whose works Neuberger collected are Jackson Pollock, Ben Shahn, William Baziotes, Alexander Calder, Stuart Davis, Louis Eilshemius, Edward Hopper, Jacob Lawrence, Jack Levine, David Smith and especially Milton Avery. The first Avery he ever purchased was &quot;Gaspé Landscape&quot;, which he bought during a snowstorm and wrapped carefully before going out, determined to keep the painting intact to make the man famous. Neuberger still had &quot;Gaspé Landscape&quot; on a wall in his apartment at the time of his death. Neuberger also began donating works to institutions, among them the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney Museum, as well as many college and university museums.

Rockefeller later became governor of New York and created the State University of New York system. For his friend Neuberger, Rockefeller established a museum at Purchase College as part of the new university where Neuberger could display a substantial amount of the art he had acquired. With the help of architect Philip Johnson, the Neuberger Museum of Art was built on the SUNY Purchase College campus and opened in 1974. Neuberger contributed more than 900 of his artworks toward the collection.

On November 15, 2007, President George W. Bush awarded the then-104-year-old Neuberger the 2007 National Medal of Arts. Neuberger claimed to have never sold a work of art, stating that &quot;It would be a criminal act for me to sell&quot;, and that &quot;I buy because I love the work.&quot;

====Corporate art collection====
Regarding the company he co-founded, he said &quot;Art in the workplace has been a part of Neuberger Berman&#x27;s corporate culture since the investment firm was founded in 1939. In 1990 Neuberger Berman began developing its own art collection, emphasizing the work of emerging mid-career artists from around the world and presenting their works in an enriching environment for employees and visitors.&quot;

==Family==
Neuberger was married for nearly 65 years to Marie Salant, also a distinguished patron of the arts, and a graduate of Bryn Mawr College; together they had three children:
* Ann Aceves
* Roy S. Neuberger
* James Neuberger

In 1997, he published his memoir, &quot;So Far, So Good - the First 94 Years&quot;. His life as an art collector is chronicled in his 2003 book &quot;The Passionate Collector: Eighty Years in the World of Art&quot;. In his later years Neuberger was often seen in the company of Kitty Carlisle Hart. Neuberger died on December 24, 2010, at the age of one hundred and seven and was buried at Mount Neboh Cemetery where other members of his family were interred.

<text>Hushmail is an encrypted proprietary web-based email service offering PGP-encrypted e-mail and vanity domain service. Hushmail uses OpenPGP standards. If public encryption keys are available to both recipient and sender (either both are Hushmail users or have uploaded PGP keys to the Hush keyserver), Hushmail can convey authenticated, encrypted messages in both directions. For recipients for whom no public key is available, Hushmail will allow a message to be encrypted by a password (with a password hint) and stored for pickup by the recipient, or the message can be sent in cleartext. In July 2016, the company launched an iOS app that offers end-to-end encryption and full integration with the webmail settings. The company is located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

==History==
Hushmail was founded by Cliff Baltzley in 1999 after he left Ultimate Privacy.

==Accounts==
===Individuals===
There is one type of paid account, Hushmail for Personal Use, which provides 10GB of storage, as well as IMAP and POP3 service.

===Businesses===
The standard business account provides the same features as the paid individual account, plus other features like vanity domain, email forwarding, catch-all email, user admin, archive, and Business Associate Agreements for healthcare plans. Features like secure forms and electronic signatures are available in specific plans.

Additional security features include hidden IP addresses in e-mail headers, two-step verification and HIPAA-compliant encryption.

===Instant messaging===
An instant messaging service, Hush Messenger, was offered until July 1, 2011.

==Compromises to email privacy==

Hushmail received favorable reviews in the press. It was believed that possible threats, such as demands from the legal system to reveal the content of traffic through the system, were not imminent in Canada unlike the United States and that if data were to be handed over, encrypted messages would be available only in encrypted form.

Developments in November 2007 led to doubts amongst security-conscious users about Hushmail&#x27;s security specifically, concern over a backdoor. The issue originated with the non-Java version of the Hush system. It performed the encrypt/decrypt steps on Hush&#x27;s servers, and then used SSL to transmit the data to the user. The data is available as cleartext during this small window of time, with the passphrase being capturable at this point, facilitating the decryption of all stored messages and future messages using this passphrase. Hushmail stated that the Java version is also vulnerable, in that they may be compelled to deliver a compromised Java applet to a user.

Hushmail supplied cleartext copies of private email messages associated with several addresses at the request of law enforcement agencies under a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the United States: e.g. in the case of &quot;United States v. Stumbo&quot;. In addition, the contents of emails between Hushmail addresses were analyzed, and 12 CDs were supplied to U.S. authorities. Hushmail privacy policy states that it logs IP addresses in order &quot;to analyze market trends, gather broad demographic information, and prevent abuse of our services.&quot;

Hush Communications, the company that provides Hushmail, states that it will not release any user data without a court order from the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada and that other countries seeking access to user data must apply to the government of Canada via an applicable Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. Hushmail states, &quot;...that means that there is no guarantee that we will not be compelled, under a court order issued by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada, to treat a user named in a court order differently, and compromise that user&#x27;s privacy&quot; and &quot;[...]if a court order has been issued by the Supreme Court of British Columbia compelling us to reveal the content of your encrypted email, the &quot;attacker&quot; could be Hush Communications, the actual service provider.&quot;

<doc id="332224" wikidata="Q1423484" url="?curid=332224" title="Canary trap">
<text>A canary trap is a method for exposing an information leak by giving different versions of a sensitive document to each of several suspects and seeing which version gets leaked. It could be one false statement, to see whether sensitive information gets out to other people as well. Special attention is paid to the quality of the prose of the unique language, in the hopes that the suspect will repeat it verbatim in the leak, thereby identifying the version of the document.

The term was coined by Tom Clancy in his novel &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, although Clancy did not invent the technique. The actual method (usually referred to as a barium meal test in espionage circles) has been used by intelligence agencies for many years. The fictional character Jack Ryan describes the technique he devised for identifying the sources of leaked classified documents:

Each summary paragraph has six different versions, and the mixture of those paragraphs is unique to each numbered copy of the paper. There are over a thousand possible permutations, but only ninety-six numbered copies of the actual document. The reason the summary paragraphs are so lurid is to entice a reporter to quote them verbatim in the public media. If he quotes something from two or three of those paragraphs, we know which copy he saw and, therefore, who leaked it.

A refinement of this technique uses a thesaurus program to shuffle through synonyms, thus making every copy of the document unique.

==Known canary trap cases==

Following the troubled production of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; in the late 1970s, Paramount Pictures effectively replaced Gene Roddenberry as producer of further movies in the franchise with Harve Bennett. Roddenberry was retained as an &quot;executive consultant&quot;, due to the high regard the series&#x27; fans held him in; while he had little real authority he was still kept involved in the creative process. The fans often complained about particular plot developments proposed for the films, such as the death of Spock in &quot;Star Trek II&quot;, that Roddenberry had opposed. So, before any drafts of the screenplay for &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; were circulated, Bennett arranged for each individual copy to have subtle clues distinguishing it from the others. Shortly after Roddenberry opposed the destruction of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; at the climax of that film, fans began to complain to Paramount and Bennett. He found that a leaked copy of the script was the one given to Roddenberry, but was unable to do anything about it.

After a series of leaks at Tesla Motors in 2008, CEO Elon Musk reportedly sent slightly different versions of an e-mail to each employee in an attempt to reveal potential leakers. The e-mail was disguised as a request to employees to sign a new non-disclosure agreement. The plan was undermined when the company&#x27;s general counsel forwarded his own unique version of the e-mail with the attached agreement. As a result, Musk&#x27;s scheme was realized by employees who now had a safe copy to leak.

In October 2019, British celebrity Coleen Rooney used the technique to identify who was leaking information from her private Instagram stories to tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; by posting fake stories which were blocked to all but one account. When these details appeared in the press, she publicly identified the leaks as coming from the account of Rebekah Vardy, wife of footballer Jamie Vardy. The subsequent libel trial became known as the Wagatha Christie case.

In December 2020, Andrew Lewer, a Member of Parliament and Parliamentary Private Secretary in the UK government, was fired after a canary trap in the form of a letter reminding staff not to leak was published on the website &quot;Guido Fawkes&quot;.

==Barium meal test==
According to the book &quot;Spycatcher&quot; by Peter Wright (published in 1987), the technique is standard practice that has been used by MI5 (and other intelligence agencies) for many years, under the name &quot;barium meal test&quot;. A barium meal test is more sophisticated than a canary trap because it is flexible and may take many different forms. However, the basic premise is to reveal a supposed secret to a suspected enemy (but nobody else) then monitor whether there is evidence of the fake information being utilised by the other side. For example, a suspected double agent could be offered some tempting &quot;bait&quot;: e.g., be told that important information was stored at a dead drop site. The fake dead drop site could then be periodically checked for signs of disturbance. If the site showed signs of being disturbed (for instance, in order to copy microfilm stored there), then this would confirm that the suspected enemy really was an enemy, i.e., a double agent.

==Embedding information==
The technique of embedding significant information in a hidden form in a medium has been used in many ways, which are usually classified according to intent:

* Watermarks are used to show that items are authentic and not forged.
* Steganography is used to hide a secret message in an apparently innocuous message, in order to escape detection.
* A canary trap hides information in a document that uniquely identifies it, so that copies of it can be traced.
* Screener versions of DVDs are often marked in some way so as to allow the tracking of unauthorised releases to their source.
* As with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; incident, major films or television productions frequently give out scripts to the cast and crew in which one or two lines are different in each individual version. Thus if the entire script is copied and leaked to the public, the producers can track down the specific person who leaked the script. In practice this does not prevent generalized information about the script from being leaked, but it does discourage leaking verbatim copies of the script itself.
* Trap streets on maps, or intentionally fictitious streets, are sometimes included to track copyright violations by those who might republish copyrighted maps illegally.
* Spurious words are sometimes included in dictionaries so as to detect other publishers copying from them. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; contains an appendix of such words with which edition of which dictionary first used them and which first duplicated them.
* Zero-width spaces are Unicode characters that are not visually rendered. An arbitrary number of these characters can be inserted between the letters of a word. Though they are not visible, they will typically persist even as that word is copied and pasted and transmitted multiple times. This can be used to create persistent, invisible fingerprints in digital text.
* Mailing lists for purchase are typically seeded with a small number of postal or email addresses that route back to the seller of the list. This is used to detect reuse of the list (typically sold on a per-mailing basis) or resale of the list (usually prohibited).
* Email aliases can be used when creating accounts to provide an email address specific to that entity so that if the address starts getting spam or is found in a data breach, it can be traced back to the source. Like with the Star Trek incident, there isn&#x27;t much that can be done about it post-hoc other than to know the source of the leak, the address is already being spammed, but in some cases, it might be important to know the source in case of a lawsuit for selling data or to fix the security weaknesses that led to a hack.
* Karaoke tracks sometimes include altered lyrics to demonstrate plagiarism between karaoke track making companies.

==In popular culture==

* The canary trap was used in several of Tom Clancy&#x27;s novels. Chronologically it first appears in &quot;Without Remorse&quot;, when a CIA official alters a report given to a senator, revealing an internal leak who was giving information to the KGB. Different versions of the report were given to other suspected leakers.
* Barium meals are also administered in Robert Littel&#x27;s book &quot;The Company&quot;, and later in the TV miniseries with same name.
* The technique (not named) was used in the 1970s BBC television serial &quot;1990&quot;. The same unnamed technique also appeared in Irving Wallace&#x27;s book &quot;The Word&quot; (1972), and in the 1985 spy novel &quot;London Match&quot; by Len Deighton.
* A variation of the canary trap was used in the film &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, with various rendezvous dates leaked to different groups.
* In the third-season finale of &quot;The Mentalist&quot;, the characters use a canary trap (giving different hotel room numbers to different suspects) to uncover a mole within their agency. A similar ruse is used in the TV series &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;.
* In &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, the second book in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series, Tyrion Lannister uses the trap to find out which member of the King&#x27;s small council is reporting to his sister, the Queen Regent Cersei Lannister. To the Grand Maester Pycelle, he tells of a plot to marry his niece, Princess Myrcella, to Prince Trystane of the powerful House Martell, from Dorne. To Littlefinger, he claims he will instead send Myrcella to be raised by Lysa Arryn and married to her son Robert. To Varys, he says his plan is to send his nephew Tommen to the Martells. When Cersei confronts him, and knows only of the plan to send Myrcella to Dorne, Tyrion knows Pycelle to be the leak.
** This plotline is also depicted in &quot;What Is Dead May Never Die&quot;, during the second season of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, the television adaptation of the books.
* When distributing the film &quot;Broken&quot; to friends, Trent Reznor claims that he watermarked the tapes with dropouts at certain points so that he could identify if a leak would surface.
* In the film &quot;The Heat&quot; starring Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock, a canary trap is employed by a drug ring to determine the loyalty of a returning member who is Detective Mullins&#x27; brother.
* In &quot;Han Solo at Stars&#x27; End&quot;, the first book in &quot;The Han Solo Adventures&quot;, the title character uses a canary trap to find a traitor and murderer among his passengers. He tells each that their target is a different planet, all false, knowing that the traitor would have learned the real destination when they killed the group&#x27;s leader.
* Episode 25 of &quot;Kamen Rider Build&quot; has the main characters trying to determine the identity of the Namba Children agent through Barium meal test. While the identity of the leaker was revealed, several episodes later established that a bug was implanted into one of the protagonists&#x27; devices by another member of the Namba Children.

<text>An additive group is a group of which the group operation is to be thought of as &quot;addition&quot; in some sense. It is usually abelian, and typically written using the symbol + for its binary operation.

This terminology is widely used with structures equipped with several operations for specifying the structure obtained by forgetting the other operations. Examples include the &quot;additive group&quot; of the integers, of a vector space and of a ring. This is particularly useful with rings and fields to distinguish the additive underlying group from the multiplicative group of the invertible elements.

In older terminology, an additive subgroup of a ring has also been known as a &quot;modul&quot; or &quot;module&quot; (not to be confused with a module).

<doc id="332232" wikidata="Q719860" url="?curid=332232" title="Charles A. Beard">
<text>Charles Austin Beard (November 27, 1874 – September 1, 1948) was an American historian and professor, who wrote primarily during the first half of the 20th century. A history professor at Columbia University, Beard&#x27;s influence is primarily due to his publications in the fields of history and political science. His works included a radical re-evaluation of the Founding Fathers of the United States, whom he believed to be more motivated by economics than by philosophical principles. Beard&#x27;s most influential book, &quot;An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States &quot;(1913), has been the subject of great controversy ever since its publication. While it has been frequently criticized for its methodology and conclusions, it was responsible for a wide-ranging reinterpretation of early American history.

An icon of the progressive school of historical interpretation, his reputation suffered during the Cold War when the assumption of economic class conflict was dropped by most American historians. The consensus historian Richard Hofstadter concluded in 1968, &quot;Today Beard&#x27;s reputation stands like an imposing ruin in the landscape of American historiography. What was once the grandest house in the province is now a ravaged survival.&quot; Hofstadter nevertheless praised Beard by saying he was &quot;foremost among the American historians of his or any generation in the search for a usable past.&quot;

== Early life and education ==

=== Childhood ===

Charles Austin Beard was born on November 27, 1874, in Knightstown, Indiana, in the Corn Belt. His father, William Henry Harrison Beard, was a farmer, contractor, part-time banker, and real-estate speculator. In his youth, Charles worked on the family farm and attended a local Quaker school, Spiceland Academy. He was expelled from the school for unclear reasons but graduated from the public Knightstown High School in 1891. For the next few years, Charles and his brother, Clarence, managed a local newspaper. Their editorial position, like their father&#x27;s, was conservative. They supported the Republican Party and favored prohibition, a cause for which Charles lectured in later years. Beard attended DePauw University, a nearby Methodist college, and graduated in 1898. He edited the college newspaper and was active in debate.

=== Education ===

Beard went to England in 1899 for graduate studies at Oxford University under Frederick York Powell. He collaborated with Walter Vrooman in founding Ruskin Hall, a school meant to be accessible to the working man. In exchange for reduced tuition, students worked in the school&#x27;s various businesses. Beard taught for the first time at Ruskin Hall and lectured to workers in industrial towns to promote Ruskin Hall and encourage enrollment in correspondence courses. He returned to the United States in 1902, where Charles pursued graduate work in history at Columbia University. He received his doctorate in 1904 and immediately joined the faculty as a lecturer. Beard married his classmate Mary Ritter in 1900. As a historian, her research interests lay in feminism and the labor union movement (&quot;Woman as a Force in History,&quot; 1946). They collaborated on many textbooks.

== Career ==

=== Columbia University ===

After receiving his doctorate from Columbia University, he joined the faculty as a lecturer. There, he provided his students with a number of reading materials that were hard to acquire. He compiled a large collection of essays and excerpts in a single volume: &quot;An Introduction to the English Historians&quot; (1906), a compendium which was an innovation at the time. An extraordinarily active author of scholarly books, textbooks, and articles for political magazines, Beard saw his career flourish. He moved from the history department to the department of public law and then to a new chair in politics and government. He also regularly taught a course in American history at Barnard College. In addition to teaching, he coached the debate team and wrote about public affairs, especially municipal reform.

Among the many works that he published during his years at Columbia, the most controversial was &quot;An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States&quot; (1913), an interpretation of how the economic interests of the members of the Constitutional Convention affected their votes. He emphasized the polarity between agrarians and business interests. Academics and politicians denounced the book, but it was well respected by scholars until it was challenged in the 1950s.

=== World War I ===

Beard strongly supported American participation in the First World War. He resigned from Columbia University on October 8, 1917, charging that &quot;the University is really under the control of a small and active group of trustees who have no standing in the world of education, who are reactionary and visionless in politics, narrow and medieval in religion. I am convinced that while I remain in the pay of the Trustees of Columbia University I cannot do effectively my part in sustaining public opinion in support of the just war on the German Empire.&quot; After a series of faculty departures from Columbia in disputes about academic freedom, his friend James Harvey Robinson also resigned from Columbia in May 1919 to become one of the founders of the New School for Social Research and serve as its first director.

=== Independent scholar ===

Following his departure from Columbia University, Beard never again sought a permanent academic appointment. His financial independence was secured by lucrative royalties he had received from his textbooks and other bestsellers, including &quot;The Rise of American Civilization&quot; (1927), and its two sequels, &quot;America in Midpassage&quot; (1939), and &quot;The American Spirit&quot; (1943). The pair also operated a dairy farm in rural Connecticut that attracted many academic visitors. Beard was active in helping to found the New School for Social Research in the Greenwich Village district of Manhattan, where the faculty would control its own membership. Enlarging upon his interest in urban affairs, he toured Japan and produced a volume of recommendations for the reconstruction of Tokyo after the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.

Beard had parallel careers as an historian and political scientist. He was active in the American Political Science Association and was elected as its president in 1926. He was also a member of the American Historical Association and served as its president in 1933. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1936. In political science, he was best known for his textbooks, his studies of the Constitution, his creation of bureaus of municipal research, and his studies of public administration in cities. Beard also taught history at the Brookwood Labor College.

Beard was a leading liberal supporter of the New Deal and an intellectual leader in the Progressive movement. However, Beard was very critical of the majoritarian vision of democracy that most Progressive leaders endorsed. In fact, &quot;Beard refrained from endorsing direct democracy measures as a blueprint for reform, focusing instead on streamlining the American system of government to incorporate in a transparent fashion, both political parties and interest groups.&quot;

=== World War II ===

Beard opposed President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign policy. Consistent with Beard&#x27;s Quaker roots, he became one of the leading proponents of non-interventionism and sought to avoid American involvement in World War II. He promoted &quot;American Continentalism&quot; as an alternative and argued that the United States had no vital interests at stake in Europe and that a foreign war could lead to domestic dictatorship. He continued to press that position after the end of World War II. In his last two books, &quot;American Foreign Policy in the Making: 1932–1940&quot; (1946) and &quot;President Roosevelt and the Coming of War&quot; (1948), Beard blamed Roosevelt for lying to the American people to trick them into war, which some historians and political scientists have disputed. He was criticized as an isolationist because of his views. The views that he espoused in the final decade of his life were disputed by many contemporary historians and political scientists.

However, some of the arguments in his &quot;President Roosevelt and the Coming of the War&quot; influenced the &quot;Wisconsin school&quot; and New Left historians in the 1960s, such as William Appleman Williams, Gabriel Kolko, and James Weinstein. On the right, Beard&#x27;s foreign policy views have become popular with &quot;paleoconservatives&quot; such as Pat Buchanan. Certain elements of his views, especially his advocacy of a non-interventionist foreign policy, have enjoyed a minor revival among a few scholars of liberty since 2001. For example, Andrew Bacevich, a diplomatic historian at Boston University, has cited Beardian skepticism towards armed overseas intervention as a starting point for a critique of US foreign policy after the Cold War in his &quot;American Empire&quot; (2004). Beard died in New Haven, Connecticut, on September 1, 1948. He was interred in Ferncliff Cemetery, Hartsdale, Westchester County, New York, joined by his wife, Mary, a decade later.

== Legacy ==
=== Progressive historiography ===
By the 1950s, Beard&#x27;s economic interpretation of history had fallen out of favor; only a few prominent historians held to his view of class conflict as a primary driver in American history, such as Howard K. Beale and C. Vann Woodward. Still, as a leader of the &quot;progressive historians&quot;, or &quot;progressive historiography&quot;, Beard introduced themes of economic self-interest and economic conflict regarding the adoption of the Constitution and the transformations caused by the Civil War. Thus, he emphasized the long-term conflict among industrialists in the Northeast, farmers in the Midwest, and planters in the South, whom he saw as the cause of the Civil War. His study of the financial interests of the drafters of the United States Constitution (&quot;An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution&quot;) seemed radical in 1913 since he proposed that it was a product of landholding Founding Fathers who were economically determinist. He saw ideology as a product of economic interests.

=== Constitution ===
The historian Carl L. Becker&#x27;s &quot;History of Political Parties in the Province of New York, 1760–1776&quot; (1909) formulated the progressive interpretation of the American Revolution. He said that there were two revolutions: one against Britain to obtain home rule and the other to determine who should rule at home. Beard expanded upon Becker&#x27;s thesis, in terms of class conflict, in &quot;An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States&quot; (1913) and &quot;An Economic Interpretation of Jeffersonian Democracy&quot; (1915). To Beard, the Constitution was a counter-revolution set up by rich bondholders (&quot;personalty&quot; since bonds were &quot;personal property&quot;), against the farmers and planters (&quot;realty&quot; since land was &quot;real property&quot;). Beard argued the Constitution was designed to reverse the radical democratic tendencies unleashed by the Revolution among the common people, especially farmers and debtors. In 1800, according to Beard, the farmers and debtors, led by plantation slaveowners, overthrew the capitalists and established Jeffersonian democracy. Other historians supported the class conflict interpretation by noting the states confiscated great semifeudal landholdings of Loyalists and gave them out in small parcels to ordinary farmers. Conservatives, such as William Howard Taft, were shocked at the progressive interpretation because it seemed to belittle the Constitution. Many scholars, however, eventually adopted Beard&#x27;s thesis and by 1930, it had become the standard interpretation of the era.

In about 1950, however, historians started to argue that the progressive interpretation was factually incorrect because the voters had not really been polarized along two economic lines. The historians were led by Charles A. Barker, Philip Crowl, Richard P. McCormick, William Pool, Robert Thomas, John Munroe, Robert E. Brown and B. Kathryn Brown, and especially Forrest McDonald. In Forrest McDonald&#x27;s &quot;We The People: The Economic Origins of the Constitution&quot; (1958) argued that Beard had misinterpreted the economic interests involved in writing the Constitution. Instead of two conflicting interests, landed and mercantile, McDonald identified some three-dozen identifiable economic interests operating at cross purposes, which forced the delegates to bargain. Evaluating the historiographical debate, Peter Novick concluded: &quot;By the early 1960s it was generally accepted within the historical profession that... Beard&#x27;s Progressive version of the... framing of the Constitution had been decisively refuted. American historians came to see... the framers of the Constitution, rather than having self-interested motives, were led by concern for political unity, national economic development, and diplomatic security.&quot; Ellen Nore, Beard&#x27;s biographer, concludes that his interpretation of the Constitution collapsed because of more recent and sophisticated analysis.

In a strong sense, that view simply involved a reaffirmation of the position that Beard had always criticized by saying that parties were prone to switch rhetorical ideals when their interest dictated. Beard&#x27;s economic determinism was largely replaced by the intellectual history approach, which stressed the power of ideas, especially republicanism, in stimulating the Revolution. However, the legacy of examining the economic interests of American historical actors can still be found in the 21st century. Recently, in &quot;To Form a More Perfect Union: A New Economic Interpretation of the United States Constitution&quot; (2003), Robert A. McGuire, relying on a sophisticated statistical analysis, argues that Beard&#x27;s basic thesis regarding the impact of economic interests in the making of the Constitution is not far from the mark.

=== Civil War and Reconstruction ===

Beard&#x27;s interpretation of the Civil War was highly influential among historians and the general public from its publication in 1927 to well into the Civil Rights Era of the late 1950s. Beard downplayed slavery, abolitionism, and issues of morality. Beard ignored constitutional issues of states&#x27; rights and even ignored American nationalism as the force that finally led to victory in the war. Indeed, the ferocious combat itself was passed over as merely an ephemeral event. Charles Ramsdell says Beard emphasized that the Civil War was caused by economic issues and was not basically about the rights or wrongs of slavery.

Thomas J. Pressly says that Beard fought against the prevailing nationalist interpretation that depicted &quot;a conflict between rival section-nations rooted in social, economic, cultural, and ideological differences.&quot; Pressly said that Beard instead portrayed a &quot;struggle between two economic economies having its origins in divergent material interests.&quot; Much more important was the calculus of class conflict. Beard announced that the Civil War was really a &quot;social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South,&quot; arguing that the events were a second American Revolution. Beard was especially interested in the postwar era, as the industrialists of the Northeast and the farmers of the West cashed in on their great victory over the southern aristocracy. Hofstadter paraphrased Beard as arguing that in victory,

&quot;the Northern capitalists were able to impose their economic program, quickly passing a series of measures on tariffs, banking, homesteads, and immigration that guaranteed the success of their plans for economic development. Solicitude for the Freedman had little to do with northern policies. The Fourteenth Amendment, which gave the Negro his citizenship, Beard found significant primarily as a result of a conspiracy of a few legislative draftsman friendly to corporations to use the supposed elevation of the blacks as a cover for a fundamental law giving strong protection to business corporations against regulation by state government.&quot;

Dealing with the Reconstruction Era and the Gilded Age, disciples of Beard, such as Howard Beale and C. Vann Woodward, focused on greed and economic causation and emphasized the centrality of corruption. They argued that the rhetoric of equal rights was a smokescreen to hide the true motivation, which was to promote the interests of industrialists in the Northeast. The basic flaw was the assumption that there was a unified business policy. Beard&#x27;s economic approach was rejected after the 1950s, as conservative scholars who researched specific subgroups discovered deep flaws in Beard&#x27;s assumption that businessmen were united on policy. In fact, businessmen were widely divergent on monetary or tariff policy. Pennsylvania businessmen wanted high tariffs, but those in other states did not. The railroads were hurt by the tariffs on steel, which they purchased in large quantities.

<text>The IFAF World Championship of American Football (also known as the IFAF World Cup) is an international gridiron competition held every four years and contested by teams representing member nations. The competition is run by the International Federation of American Football (IFAF), the international governing body for the sport. Seventy-one nations have a national American football team. The most recent tournament, in 2015, featured seven teams.

The defending champions are the United States, who won the 2015 championship after winning both the 2007 and 2011 editions. The U.S. team did not compete in the World Cup until 2007 and have won every tournament since. Prior to the American entrance, Japan won the 1999 and 2003 championships.

The championship was held in Italy in 1999, in Germany in 2003, in Kawasaki, Japan in 2007, and in Austria in 2011. The 2015 IFAF World Championship was originally going to be held in Stockholm, Sweden, however local organizers had to cancel the event due to lack of sponsorship. The 2015 tournament was played in Canton, Ohio, United States.

==Tournament format==
At the 2011 championship, the championship tournament consisted of eight teams divided into two groups of four (there were six teams in 1999 and 2007, four in 2003, and seven in 2015). The opening round featured a round-robin tournament within the groups, with each team playing each other once. However, as opposed to a tournament bracket after the games were completed, the teams with the best record from each group met in the gold medal game, with the second-place teams in each group playing for the bronze medal, the third-place teams playing in the 5th-place game, and the fourth-place teams playing in the 7th-place game, thus guaranteeing each team four games.

Automatic berths included the host nation and the defending champions. Both finalists from the European Championship of American football tournament received berths. Two teams from the Pan American Federation of American Football received berths, as did one member each from the Asian Federation of American Football and from the Oceania Federation of American Football.

For the 2019 championship (postponed to 2023, then 2025), the tournament will expand to 12 teams. Teams will be divided into four groups, each consisting of three teams. Teams will play the other two teams in their group once each, for a total of two group-stage games. Teams will then advance to the second round, and from there to the placement and medal games.

Because American football is far more dominant in the United States than anywhere else in the world, the United States did not field a team in the tournament for its first two editions. The United States has fielded a squad for the last three iterations, but with extremely restrictive criteria that make most American football players ineligible for the team. Despite the restrictions, the United States has won all three world championships in which they have competed. Similarly, Canada (where Canadian football, a related sport, has widespread popularity) did not participate until the 2011 competition, when the Canadian team finished second to the United States.

<text>Bushmeat is meat from wildlife species that are hunted for human consumption. Bushmeat represents a primary source of animal protein and a cash-earning commodity in poor and rural communities of humid tropical forest regions of the world.

The numbers of animals killed and traded as bushmeat in the 1990s in West and Central Africa were thought to be unsustainable.
By 2005, commercial harvesting and trading of bushmeat was considered a threat to biodiversity. As of 2016, 301 terrestrial mammals were threatened with extinction due to hunting for bushmeat including non-human primates, even-toed ungulates, bats, diprotodont marsupials, rodents and carnivores occurring in developing countries.

Bushmeat provides increased opportunity for transmission of several zoonotic viruses from animal hosts to humans, such as &quot;Ebolavirus&quot; and HIV.

== Nomenclature ==
The term &#x27;bushmeat&#x27; is originally an African term for wildlife species that are hunted for human consumption, and usually refers specifically to the meat of African wildlife.
In October 2000, the IUCN World Conservation Congress passed a resolution on the unsustainable commercial trade in &quot;wild meat&quot;. Affected countries were urged to recognize the increasing ramifications of the bushmeat trade, to strengthen and enforce legislation, and to develop action programmes to mitigate the consequences of the trade. Donor organisations were requested to provide funding for the implementation of such programmes.

Wildlife hunting for food is important for the livelihood security of and supply of dietary protein for poor people. It can be sustainable when carried out by traditional hunter-gatherers in large landscapes for their own consumption. Due to the extent of bushmeat hunting for trade in markets, the survival of those species that are large-bodied and reproduce slowly is threatened. The term &quot;bushmeat crisis&quot; was coined in 2007 and refers to this dual threat of depleting food resources and wildlife extinctions, both entailed by the bushmeat trade.

== Affected wildlife species ==
Globally, more than 1,000 animal species are estimated to be affected by hunting for bushmeat.
Bushmeat hunters use mostly leg-hold snare traps to catch any wildlife, but prefer to kill large species, as these provide a greater amount of meat than small species.


The volume of the bushmeat trade in West and Central Africa was estimated at per year at the turn of the 21st century. In 2002, it was estimated that species weighing more than contribute of meat per year to the bushmeat extracted in the Congo Basin, based on 24 individuals. Species weighing &quot;less&quot; than were estimated to contribute , also based on 24 individuals. Bushmeat extraction in the Amazon rainforest was estimated to be much lower, at in the case of species weighing more than 10 kg and in the case of species weighing less than 10 kg, based on 3 individuals.
Based on these estimates, a total of bushmeat is extracted in the Congo Basin per year, ranging from in Equatorial Guinea to in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The 301 mammal species threatened by hunting for bushmeat comprise 126 primates, 65 even-toed ungulates, 27 bats, 26 diprotodont marsupials, 21 rodents, 12 carnivores and all pangolin species.

Primate species offered fresh and smoked in 2009 at a wildlife market by Liberia&#x27;s Cavally River included chimpanzee (&quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;), Diana monkey (&quot;Cercopithecus diana&quot;), putty-nosed monkey (&quot;C. nictitans&quot;), lesser spot-nosed monkey (&quot;C. petaurista&quot;), Campbell&#x27;s mona monkey (&quot;C. campbelli&quot;), sooty mangabey (&quot;Cercocebus atys&quot;), king colobus (&quot;Colobus polykomos&quot;), olive colobus (&quot;Procolobus verus&quot;), western red colobus (&quot;P. badius&quot;). Duiker species constituted more than half of the total 723 animals offered.
In 2012, the bushmeat trade was surveyed in three villages in the Sassandra Department, Ivory Coast. During six months, nine restaurants received 376 mammals and eight reptiles, including dwarf crocodile (&quot;Osteolaemus tetraspis&quot;), harnessed bushbuck (&quot;Tragelaphus scriptus&quot;), Maxwell&#x27;s duiker (&quot;Philantomba maxwellii&quot;), bay duiker (&quot;Cephalophus dorsalis&quot;), Campbell&#x27;s mona monkey, lesser spot-nosed monkey, potto (&quot;Perodicticus potto&quot;), tree pangolin (&quot;Phataginus tricuspis&quot;), long-tailed pangolin (&quot;P. tetradactyla&quot;), African brush-tailed porcupine (&quot;Atherurus africanus&quot;), giant pouched rat (&quot;Cricetomys gambianus&quot;), greater cane rat (&quot;Thryonomys swinderianus&quot;), striped ground squirrel (&quot;Xerus erythropus&quot;) and western tree hyrax (&quot;Dendrohyrax dorsalis&quot;).
About 128,400 straw-coloured fruit bats (&quot;Eidolon helvum&quot;) were estimated in 2011 to be traded as bushmeat every year in four cities in southern Ghana.

In 2006, it was estimated that about 1,437,458 animals are killed every year in the Nigerian and Cameroon parts of the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests, including about 43,880 Emin&#x27;s pouched rats (&quot;Cricetomys emini&quot;), 41,800 tree pangolins, 39,700 putty-nosed monkeys, 22,500 Mona monkeys (&quot;Cercopithecus mona&quot;), 3,500 red-eared guenons (&quot;C. erythrotis&quot;), 20,300 drills (&quot;Mandrillus leucophaeus&quot;), 15,300 African civets (&quot;Civettictis civetta&quot;), 11,900 common kusimanses (&quot;Crossarchus obscurus&quot;), more than 7,600 African palm civets (&quot;Nandinia binotata&quot;), 26,760 Nile monitors (&quot;Varanus niloticus&quot;) and 410 African forest elephants (&quot;Loxodonta cyclotis&quot;).
Between 1983 and 2002, the Gabon populations of western gorilla (&quot;Gorilla gorilla&quot;) and common chimpanzee (&quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;) were estimated to have declined by 56%. This decline was primarily caused by the commercial hunting, which was facilitated by the extended infrastructure for logging purposes.
Marsh mongoose (&quot;Atilax paludinosus&quot;) and long-nosed mongoose (&quot;Herpestes naso&quot;) are the most numerous small carnivores offered in rural bushmeat markets in the country.

In the late 1990s, fresh and smoked bonobo (&quot;Pan paniscus&quot;) carcasses were observed in Basankusu in the Province of Équateur in the Congo Basin.
The main species killed by bushmeat hunters in Tanzania&#x27;s Katavi-Rukwa Region include impala (&quot;Aepyceros melampus&quot;), common duiker (&quot;Sylvicapra grimmia&quot;), warthog (&quot;Phacocherus africanus&quot;), Cape buffalo (&quot;Syncerus caffer&quot;), harnessed bushbuck, red river hog (&quot;Potamochoerus porcus&quot;) and plains zebra (&quot;Equus quagga&quot;).
A survey in a rural area in southwestern Madagascar revealed that bushmeat hunters target bushpig (&quot;Potamochoerus larvatus&quot;), ring-tailed lemur (&quot;Lemur catta&quot;), Verreaux&#x27;s sifaka (&quot;Propithecus verreauxi&quot;), Hubbard&#x27;s sportive lemur (&quot;Lepilemur hubbardorum&quot;), fat-tailed dwarf lemur (&quot;Cheirogaleus medius&quot;), common tenrec (&quot;Tenrec ecaudatus&quot;), grey mouse lemur (&quot;Microcebus murinus&quot;), reddish-gray mouse lemur (&quot;M. griseorufus&quot;), Madagascan fruit bat (&quot;Eidolon dupreanum&quot;) and Madagascan flying fox (&quot;Pteropus rufus&quot;).

== Dynamics ==
=== Logging ===
Logging concessions operated by companies in African forests have been closely linked to the bushmeat trade. Because they provide roads, trucks and other access to remote forests, they are the primary means for the transportation of hunters and meat between forests and urban centres. Some, including the Congolaise Industrielle du Bois (CIB) in the Republic of Congo, partnered with governments and international conservation organizations to regulate the bushmeat trade within the concessions where they operate. Numerous solutions are needed; because each country has different circumstances, traditions and laws, no one solution will work in every location.

===Nutrition===
Bushmeat can be an important source of micronutrients and macronutrients. A study of South Americans in the Tres Fronteras region found that those who consumed bushmeat were at a lower risk of anemia and chronic health conditions, as their diets included more iron, zinc, and vitamin C than those who did not eat bushmeat.

=== Overfishing ===
In Ghana, international illegal over-exploitation of African fishing grounds has increased demand for bushmeat. Both European Union-subsidized fleets and local commercial fleets have depleted fish stocks, leaving local people to supplement their diets with animals hunted from nature reserves. Over 30 years of data link sharp declines in both mammal populations and the biomass of 41 wildlife species with a decreased supply of fish.
Consumption of fish and of bushmeat is correlated: the decline of one resource drives up the demand and price for the other.

=== Pastoralism ===
Transhumant pastoralists from the border area between Sudan and the Central African Republic are accompanied by armed merchants who also engage in poaching large herbivores. The decline of giant eland, Cape buffalo, hartebeest and waterbuck in the Chinko area between 2012 and 2017 is attributed to their poaching activities. They use livestock to transport bushmeat to markets.

== Role in spread of diseases ==
Animal sources may have been the cause for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy, cholera, smallpox, measles, influenza, and syphilis acquired by early agrarians. The emergence of HIV-1, AIDS, Ebola virus disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are attributed to animal sources today.
Thomas&#x27;s rope squirrel (&quot;Funisciurus anerythrus&quot;) and red-legged sun squirrel (&quot;Heliosciurus rufobrachium&quot;) were found to carry MPXV in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the 1980s.

Outbreaks of the Ebola virus in the Congo Basin and in Gabon in the 1990s have been associated with the butchering and consumption of chimpanzees and bonobos. Bushmeat hunters in Central Africa infected with the human T-lymphotropic virus were closely exposed to wild primates.
Anthrax can be transmitted when butchering and eating ungulates. The risk of bloodborne diseases to be transmitted is higher when butchering a carcass than when transporting, cooking and eating it.

Many hunters and traders are not aware of zoonosis and the risks of disease transmissions.
An interview survey in rural communities in Nigeria revealed that 55% of the respondents knew of zoonoses, but their education and cultural traditions are important drivers for hunting and eating bushmeat despite the risks involved.

=== HIV ===
Results of research on wild chimpanzees in Cameroon indicate that they are naturally infected with the simian foamy virus and constitute a reservoir of HIV-1, a precursor of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans. There are several distinct strains of HIV, indicating that this cross-species transfer has occurred several times. Simian immunodeficiency virus present in chimpanzees is reportedly derived from older strains of the virus present in the collared mangabey (&quot;Cercocebus torquatus&quot;) and the putty-nosed monkey. It is likely that HIV was initially transferred to humans after having come into contact with infected bushmeat.

=== Ebola ===
The natural reservoirs of ebolaviruses are unknown. Possible reservoirs include non-human primates, megabats, rodents, shrews, carnivores, and ungulates.
Between October 2001 and December 2003, five Ebola virus outbreaks occurred in the border area between Gabon and Republic of Congo. Autopsies of wildlife carcasses showed that chimpanzees, gorillas and bay duikers were infected with the virus.
The Ebola virus has been linked to bushmeat, with some researchers hypothesizing that megabats are a primary host of at least some variants of Ebola virus. Between the first recorded outbreak in 1976 and the largest in 2014, the virus has transferred from animals to humans only 30 times, despite large numbers of bats being killed and sold each year. Bats drop partially eaten fruits and pulp, then terrestrial mammals such as gorillas and duikers feed on these fruits. This chain of events forms a possible indirect means of transmission from the natural host to animal populations.
The suspected index case for the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa in 2014 was a two-year-old boy in Meliandou in south-eastern Guinea, who played in a hollow tree harbouring a colony of Angolan free-tailed bats (&quot;Mops condylurus&quot;).

Results of a study conducted during the Ebola crisis in Liberia showed that socio-economic conditions affected bushmeat consumption. During the crisis, there was a decrease in bushmeat consumption and daily meal frequency. In addition, preferences for bushmeat species stayed the same.

===Parasites===
In Cameroon, 15 primate species were examined for gastrointestinal parasites. Bushmeat primates were infected with &quot;Trichuris&quot;, &quot;Entamoeba&quot;, &quot;Ascaris&quot;, &quot;Capillaria&quot;, pinworms, &quot;Bertiella&quot; and &quot;Endolimax nana&quot;.
A large proportion of &quot;Bitis&quot; vipers sold at rural bushmeat markets in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are infected by &quot;Armillifer grandis&quot;, which represent a threat to public health.

==Management==
Suggestions for reducing or halting bushmeat harvest and trade include:
* increase access of consumers to affordable and reliable alternative sources of animal protein such as chicken, small livestock and farmed fish raised at family level;
* devolve rights and authority over wildlife to local communities;
* strengthen the management of protected areas and enforce wildlife conservation laws.

As an alternative to bushmeat, captive breeding of species traditionally harvested from the wild is sometimes feasible. Captive breeding efforts must be closely monitored, as there is risk they can be used to launder and legitimize individuals captured from the wild, similar to the laundering of wild green tree pythons in Indonesia for the pet trade.

<text>Simchat Torah (; Ashkenazi: ), also spelled Simhat Torah, is a Jewish holiday that celebrates and marks the conclusion of the annual cycle of public Torah readings, and the beginning of a new cycle. Simchat Torah is a component of the Biblical Jewish holiday of &quot;Shemini Atzeret&quot; (&quot;Eighth Day of Assembly&quot;), which follows immediately after the festival of Sukkot in the month of Tishrei (occurring in September or October on the Gregorian calendar).

Simchat Torah&#x27;s main celebrations occur in the synagogue during evening and morning services. In many Orthodox as well as many Conservative congregations, this is the only time of year on which the Torah scrolls are taken out of the ark and read at &quot;night&quot;. In the morning, the last &quot;parashah&quot; of Deuteronomy and the first &quot;parashah&quot; of Genesis are read in the synagogue. On each occasion, when the ark is opened, the worshippers leave their seats to dance and sing with the Torah scrolls in a joyous celebration that lasts several hours.

The morning service is also uniquely characterized by each member of the congregation being called up for an &quot;aliyah&quot;. There is also a special &quot;aliyah&quot; for children.

==Duration of holiday==

On the Hebrew calendar, the seven-day holiday of Sukkot in the autumn (late mid-September to late mid-October) is immediately followed by the holiday of Shemini Atzeret. In Orthodox and Conservative communities outside Israel, Shemini Atzeret is a two-day holiday, and the Simchat Torah festivities are observed on the second day. The first day is called &quot;Shemini Atzeret&quot;, and the second day as &quot;Simchat Torah&quot;. However, according to Halakha, both days are officially Shemini Atzeret, reflected in the liturgy. Many Hasidic communities have Hakafot on the eve of the first day of Shemini Atzeret. However, in all communities outside Israel, no Hakafot is done on the first morning.

In Israel, Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah are celebrated on the same day. Reform congregations, even outside Israel, may do likewise. Many communities in Israel have &quot;Hakafot Shniyot&quot; (&quot;Second Hakafot&quot;) on the evening following the holiday, which is the same day as Simchat Torah evening in the diaspora. The custom was started by the former Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv, Rabbi Yedidya Frankel.

==Evening festivities==
The Simchat Torah festivities begin with the evening service. All the synagogue&#x27;s Torah scrolls are removed from the ark and are carried around the sanctuary in a series of seven &quot;hakafot&quot; (circuits). Although each &quot;hakafa&quot; needs to encompass only one circuit around the synagogue, the dancing and singing with the Torah often continues much longer and may overflow onto the streets.

In Orthodox and Conservative Jewish synagogues, each circuit is announced by a few melodious invocations imploring God to &quot;Hoshiah Na&quot; (&quot;Save us&quot;) and ending with the refrain, &quot;Aneinu v&#x27;Yom Kor&#x27;einu&quot; (&quot;[God] answer us on the day we call&quot;). In Orthodox and Conservative synagogues, the &quot;hakafot&quot; are accompanied by traditional chants, including biblical and liturgical verses and songs about the Torah, the goodness of God (&quot;Mipi El&quot; is an example), Messianic yearnings, and prayers for the restoration of the House of David and of the Temple in Jerusalem. Congregations may also sing other popular songs during the dancing. Children often receive flags, candies, and other treats. The vigor of the dancing and degree of festive merriment varies with congregational temperament.

In Orthodox synagogues, men and boys predominate in the dancing; children (even young girls) may also dance with their fathers. Women and older girls often have dancing circles (sometimes with the Torah scrolls) or look on from the other side of a &quot;mechitza&quot; (partition), in accordance with the value of &quot;tzniut&quot; (modesty).
In Conservative and Progressive congregations, men and women dance together. In some congregations, the Torah scrolls are carried out into the streets, and the dancing may continue far into the evening.

After the &quot;hakafot&quot;, many congregations recite a portion of the last &quot;parashah&quot; of the Torah, &quot;V&#x27;Zot HaBerakhah&quot; (&quot;This is the Blessing ...&quot;) in Deuteronomy. The part read is usually 33:1–34:12, but this may vary by individual synagogue custom, although Deuteronomy is never read to the end of the evening.

==Morning festivities==
The morning service, like that of other Jewish holidays, includes a special holiday Amidah, the saying of Hallel, and a holiday Mussaf service. When the ark is opened to take out the Torah for the Torah reading, all the scrolls are removed from the ark, and the congregation starts the seven &quot;hakafot&quot; just like in the evening.

===Early priestly blessing===

In most Eastern Ashkenazic communities, one deviation from an otherwise ordinary holiday morning service is the performance of the Priestly Blessing as part of the Shacharit service before the celebrations connected with the Torah reading begin, rather than as part of the Musaf service that follows. This practice hearkens back to an old custom for the kiddush sponsored by the Hatan Torah (see below) to be held during the Simchat Torah service itself, where hard liquor (along with other refreshments) may be served. Since the Bible prohibits Kohanim (descendants of Aaron) from performing the priestly blessing while intoxicated, and there is concern that Kohanim may imbibe alcoholic beverages during the Simchat Torah festivities, the blessing was moved to before the time when alcohol would be served. In some congregations, the Kohanim deliver their blessing as usual during the Musaf service of Simchat Torah. In some Western Ashkenazic communities and many communities in Israel, the Kohanim deliver their blessing at Shacharit and Musaf services, as at every festival.

===Torah reading and customs===
After the &quot;hakafot&quot; and the dancing, three scrolls of the Torah are read. The last &quot;parashah&quot; of the Torah, V&#x27;Zot HaBerakhah, at the end of Deuteronomy (33:1–34:12), is read from the first scroll, followed immediately by the first chapter (and part of the second) of the Book of Genesis (1:1–2:3), which is read from the second scroll. It is a Jewish custom that a new beginning must immediately follow a completion; therefore, reading Gen. 1 immediately after finishing Deuteronomy is logical.

It is a special honor to receive the last &quot;aliyah&quot; of the Book of Deuteronomy; the person receiving that aliyah is called the &quot;Hatan Torah&quot; (Torah Groom). Initially, &quot;Hotem Torah&quot; (Torah Completer), the term shifted in the medieval period and now signifies a titled honoree. By extension of this shift, the person who is called to begin Genesis is known as the &quot;Hatan Bereishit&quot; (Genesis Groom) and, in synagogues that allow women to receive an &quot;aliyah&quot;, the honorees are known as &quot;Kallat Torah&quot; (Torah Bride) and &quot;Kallat Bereishit&quot; (Genesis Bride). According to historical custom, still practiced in many congregations, these &quot;grooms&quot; are wealthy patrons of the synagogue who recognize the honor with special largesse; Modern Orthodox congregations generally choose Torah scholars instead.

In many congregations, it is customary to call all eligible congregation members for an &quot;aliyah&quot; to the Torah on Simchat Torah. To accommodate this, the first five &quot;aliyot&quot; are reread so that everyone has an opportunity to recite the blessing. To save time, some congregations call people up in groups. Others hold a series of separate &quot;minyanim&quot; for the Torah reading. In a minority of Orthodox congregations, women receive &quot;aliyot&quot; in single-gender tefillah groups (prayer groups consisting only of women who pray together), and only men are called to the Torah in front of the whole congregation.

Another custom is to call all the children (in Orthodox congregations, boys only) to a special &quot;aliyah&quot; called &quot;Kol HaNe&#x27;arim&quot; (&quot;all the children&quot;). In many congregations, a large tallit is spread out over the heads of all the children as the blessing over the Torah is pronounced. The congregation blesses the children by reciting (in Hebrew) a verse from Jacob&#x27;s blessing to Ephraim and Manasseh, Genesis 48:16.

Although the blessing of the children is omitted from the 1985 edition of Conservative Judaism&#x27;s Siddur Sim Shalom prayer book, it was reinstated in later versions. Most Conservative congregations still perform it.

After the portion of Genesis is read, the Maftir, Numbers 29:35–30:1, is read from a third Torah scroll. The passage describes the prescribed offerings performed for the holiday. The haftarah (reading from the prophets) is the first section of the Book of Joshua.

==History==

The name &quot;Simhat Torah&quot; was not used until relatively recently. In the Talmud (Meg. 31b), it is called Shemini Atzeret. 

=== Celebration and dancing ===
Modern customs of celebration and dancing arose in the early Rishonic period. Isaac ibn Ghayyat (1030–1089) writes in his &quot;Me&#x27;ah She&#x27;arim&quot; that he asked Hayy ben Sherira &quot;about those whose wont is to remove the sefer torah from its ark at the close of the holiday, and [Hayy] responded that this is not our practice ... but that local customs should not change.&quot; Joseph Colon Trabotto adds in his &quot;Responsa&quot; that in his edition (ours is lacunose), ibn Ghayyat added that Hayy had also written, &quot;Our habit is to dance [on the day after Sh&#x27;mini Atzeret] specifically, even many of the elders, when they make eulogies of the torah, and this is permitted because it glorifies the torah&quot;, a ruling affirmed by Moses Isserles (&quot;Darkhei Moshe&quot;). This places the custom of removing the scrolls from the ark and dancing in some locales into the 11th century. Abraham ben Isaac of Narbonne (1080–1158) writes in &quot;haEshkol&quot; that &quot;this teaches that we make a feast to complete the torah, therefore we make great feasts and ample delicacies on the day of Simchat Torah, to honor the torah&#x27;s completion&quot;. Abraham ben Nathan (12th century) writes in &quot;haManhig&quot; that &quot;the French rite is ... they make large celebrations, the entire community in the homes of the honorees, because it is the Simchat Torah.&quot; Zedekiah ben Abraham Anaw (13th century) writes in &quot;Shibbolei haLeqet&quot; that &quot;It is called Simchat Torah ... the custom is for the Chatan Torah to make a feast and to distribute sweets and candies&quot;.

=== Readings ===
As early as the 9th century, perhaps earlier, some Jewish communities assigned a special reading from the Prophets to be read on this day. In the 13th century, the reading of Genesis was added in some communities immediately upon the completion of Deuteronomy, and the Shulhan Arukh (written about 1565) codifies this. There is presumably a later custom of southern European countries to remove all the Torah scrolls from the ark and to sing a separate hymn for each one. In northern European countries, those who had finished the reading of Deuteronomy donated to the synagogue, after which the wealthier members of the community would give a dinner for friends and acquaintances. By the end of the 15th century, it was a common though not universal practice for the children to tear down and burn the sukkahs on Simchat Torah.

In the 16th century, taking out the scrolls and filing solemnly around the bimah on the night of the 23rd of Tishri became customary. On the same evening, several passages from the Torah were read after the procession.

In the 17th century, Rebecca bat Meir Tiktiner of Prague composed a poem about Simchat Torah.

In Poland, it was the custom to sell to the members of the congregation, on the 23rd of Tishri, the privilege of executing various functions during the services on Shabbat and Jewish festivals; i.e., the synagogue used this occasion as a fund-raiser. People who made these donations were called to the Torah and given a congregational blessing.

==Symbolism==
===&quot;Feet&quot; of the Torah===
In Chabad Hasidic thought, the traditional dancing with the Torah allows the Jew to act as the &quot;feet&quot; of the Torah, taking the Torah where it wishes to go, as feet transport the head. This is considered an act of submission to the will of God as expressed in the dictates of the Torah. It is an act that causes the Jew to inherently and naturally observe the Jewish faith. And just as the head benefits from the mobility of the feet, so does the Torah become exalted by the commitment of the Jew.

===Symbol of Jewish identity===
In the 20th century, Simhat Torah symbolized the public assertion of Jewish identity. The Jews of the Soviet Union, in particular, would celebrate the festival &quot;en masse&quot; in the streets of Moscow. On October 14, 1973, more than 100,000 Jews took part in a post–Simhat Torah rally in New York City on behalf of refuseniks and Soviet Jewry. Dancing in the street with the Torah has become part of the holiday&#x27;s ritual in various Jewish congregations in the United States as well.

===Rejoicing under adversity===
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel said:The Gaon of Vilna said that &quot;ve-samachta be-chagekha&quot; (You shall rejoice in your festival; Deuteronomy 16:14) is the most difficult commandment in the Torah. I could never understand this puzzling remark. Only during the war did I understand. Those Jews who, in the course of their journey to the end of hope, managed to dance on Simhat Torah, those Jews who studied Talmud by heart while carrying stones on their back, those Jews who went on whispering &quot;Zemirot shel Shabbat&quot; (Hymns of Sabbath) while performing hard labor ... &quot;ve-samachta be-chagekha&quot; was one commandment that was impossible to observe—yet they observed it.

==Commemoration==

In 1996, the Israel Postal Authority issued a postage stamp to honor the holiday.

<text>Karl Theodor Jaspers (; ; 23 February 1883 – 26 February 1969) was a German-Swiss psychiatrist and philosopher who had a strong influence on modern theology, psychiatry, and philosophy. His 1913 work &quot;General Psychopathology&quot; influenced many later diagnostic criteria, and argued for a distinction between &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; delusions. 

After being trained in and practising psychiatry, Jaspers turned to philosophical inquiry and attempted to develop an innovative philosophical system. He was often viewed as a major exponent of existentialism in Germany, though he did not accept the label.

== Life ==

Jaspers was born in Oldenburg in 1883 to a mother from a local farming community, and a jurist father. He showed an early interest in philosophy, but his father&#x27;s experience with the legal system influenced his decision to study law at Heidelberg University. Jaspers first studied law in Heidelberg and later in Munich for three semesters. It soon became clear that Jaspers did not particularly enjoy law, and he switched to studying medicine in 1902 with a thesis about criminology. In 1910 he married Gertrud Mayer (1879–1974), the sister of his close friends Gustav Mayer and Ernst Mayer.

Jaspers earned his medical doctorate from the Heidelberg University medical school in 1908 and began work at a psychiatric hospital in Heidelberg under Franz Nissl, the successor of Emil Kraepelin and Karl Bonhoeffer, and Karl Wilmans. Jaspers became dissatisfied with the way the medical community of the time approached the study of mental illness and gave himself the task of improving the psychiatric approach. In 1913 Jaspers habilitated at the philosophical faculty of the Heidelberg University and gained there in 1914 a post as a psychology teacher. The post later became a permanent philosophical one, and Jaspers never returned to clinical practice. During this time Jaspers was a close friend of the Weber family (Max Weber also having held a professorship at Heidelberg).

In 1921, at the age of 38, Jaspers turned from psychology to philosophy, expanding on themes he had developed in his psychiatric works. He became a well-known philosopher across Germany and Europe.

After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Jaspers was considered to have a &quot;Jewish taint&quot; (&quot;jüdische Versippung&quot;, in the jargon of the time) due to his Jewish wife, Gertrude Mayer, and was forced to retire from teaching in 1937. In 1938 he fell under a publication ban as well. Many of his long-time friends stood by him, however, and he was able to continue his studies and research without being totally isolated. But he and his wife were under constant threat of removal to a concentration camp until 30 March 1945, when Heidelberg was occupied by American troops.

In 1948 Jaspers moved to the University of Basel in Switzerland. In 1963 he was awarded the honorary citizenship of the city of Oldenburg in recognition of his outstanding scientific achievements and services to occidental culture. He remained prominent in the philosophical community and became a naturalized citizen of Switzerland living in Basel until his death on his wife&#x27;s 90th birthday in 1969.

== Contributions to psychiatry ==
Jaspers&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the popular understanding of mental illness led him to question both the diagnostic criteria and the methods of clinical psychiatry. He published a paper in 1910 in which he addressed the problem of whether paranoia was an aspect of personality or the result of biological changes. Although it did not broach new ideas, this article introduced a rather unusual method of study, at least according to the norms then prevalent. Not unlike Freud, Jaspers studied patients in detail, giving biographical information about the patients as well as notes on how the patients themselves felt about their symptoms. This has become known as the &quot;biographical method&quot; and now forms a mainstay of psychiatric and above all psychotherapeutic practice.
Jaspers set down his views on mental illness in a book which he published in 1913, &quot;General Psychopathology&quot;. This work has become a classic in the psychiatric literature and many modern diagnostic criteria stem from ideas found within it. One of Jaspers&#x27;s central tenets was that psychiatrists should diagnose symptoms of mental illness (particularly of psychosis) by their &quot;form&quot; rather than by their &quot;content&quot;. For example, in diagnosing a hallucination, it is more important to note that a person experiences visual phenomena when no sensory stimuli account for them than to note what the patient sees. What the patient sees is the &quot;content&quot;, but the discrepancy between visual perception and objective reality is the &quot;form&quot;.

Jaspers thought that psychiatrists could diagnose delusions in the same way. He argued that clinicians should not consider a belief delusional based on the content of the belief, but only based on the way in which a patient holds such a belief. (See delusion for further discussion.) Jaspers also distinguished between &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary delusions&quot;. He defined primary delusions as &quot;autochthonous&quot;, meaning that they arise without apparent cause, appearing incomprehensible in terms of a normal mental process. (This is a slightly different use of the word &quot;autochthonous&quot; than the ordinary medical or sociological use as a synonym for indigenous.) Secondary delusions, on the other hand, he defined as those influenced by the person&#x27;s background, current situation or mental state.

Jaspers considered primary delusions to be ultimately &quot;un-understandable&quot; since he believed no coherent reasoning process existed behind their formation. This view has caused some controversy, and the likes of R. D. Laing and Richard Bentall (1999, p. 133–135) have criticised it, stressing that this stance can lead therapists into the complacency of assuming that because they do not understand a patient, the patient is deluded and further investigation on the part of the therapist will have no effect. For instance, Huub Engels (2009) argues that schizophrenic disordered speech may be understandable, just as Emil Kraepelin&#x27;s dream speech is understandable.

== Contributions to philosophy and theology ==
Most commentators associate Jaspers with the philosophy of existentialism, in part because he draws largely upon the existentialist roots of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, and in part because the theme of individual freedom permeates his work. In &quot;Philosophy&quot; (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and empiricism, Jaspers points out that as people question reality, they confront borders that an empirical (or scientific) method simply cannot transcend. At this point, the individual faces a choice: sink into despair and resignation, or take a leap of faith toward what Jaspers calls &quot;Transcendence&quot;. In making this leap, individuals confront their own limitless freedom, which Jaspers calls &quot;Existenz&quot;, and can finally experience authentic existence.

Transcendence (paired with the term &quot;The Encompassing&quot; in later works) is, for Jaspers, that which exists beyond the world of time and space. Jaspers&#x27;s formulation of Transcendence as ultimate non-objectivity (or no-thing-ness) has led many philosophers to argue that ultimately, Jaspers became a monist, though Jaspers himself continually stressed the necessity of recognizing the validity of the concepts both of subjectivity and of objectivity.

Although he rejected explicit religious doctrines, including the notion of a personal God, Jaspers influenced contemporary theology through his philosophy of transcendence and the limits of human experience. Mystic Christian traditions influenced Jaspers himself tremendously, particularly those of Meister Eckhart and of Nicholas of Cusa. He also took an active interest in Eastern philosophies, particularly Buddhism, and developed the theory of an Axial Age, a period of substantial philosophical and religious development. Jaspers also entered public debates with Rudolf Bultmann, wherein Jaspers roundly criticized Bultmann&#x27;s &quot;demythologizing&quot; of Christianity.

Jaspers wrote extensively on the threat to human freedom posed by modern science and modern economic and political institutions. During World War II, he had to abandon his teaching post because his wife was Jewish. After the war, he resumed his teaching position, and in his work &quot;The Question of German Guilt&quot; he unabashedly examined the culpability of Germany as a whole in the atrocities of Hitler&#x27;s Third Reich.

The following quote about the Second World War and its atrocities was used at the end of the sixth episode of the BBC documentary series &quot;The Nazis: A Warning from History&quot;: &quot;That which has happened is a warning. To forget it is guilt. It must be continually remembered. It was possible for this to happen, and it remains possible for it to happen again at any minute. Only in knowledge can it be prevented.&quot;

Jaspers&#x27;s major works, lengthy and detailed, can seem daunting in their complexity. His last great attempt at a systematic philosophy of Existenz – &quot;Von der Wahrheit&quot; (On Truth) – has not yet appeared in English. However, he also wrote shorter works, most notably &quot;Philosophy Is for Everyman&quot;. The two major proponents of phenomenological hermeneutics, namely Paul Ricœur (a student of Jaspers) and Hans-Georg Gadamer (Jaspers&#x27;s successor at Heidelberg), both display Jaspers&#x27;s influence in their works.

== Political views ==
Jaspers identified with the liberal political philosophy of Max Weber, although he rejected Weber&#x27;s nationalism. He valued humanism and cosmopolitanism and, influenced by Immanuel Kant, advocated an international federation of states with shared constitutions, laws, and international courts. He strongly opposed totalitarian despotism and warned about the increasing tendency towards technocracy, or a regime that regards humans as mere instruments of science or of ideological goals. He was also sceptical of majoritarian democracy. Thus, he supported a form of governance that guaranteed individual freedom and limited government, and shared Weber&#x27;s belief that democracy needed to be guided by an intellectual elite. His views were seen as anti-communist.

== Influences ==
Jaspers held Kierkegaard and Nietzsche to be two of the most important figures in post-Kantian philosophy. In his compilation, &quot;The Great Philosophers&quot; (&quot;Die großen Philosophen&quot;), he wrote: &quot;I approach the presentation of Kierkegaard with some trepidation. Next to Nietzsche, or rather, prior to Nietzsche, I consider him to be the most important thinker of our post-Kantian age. With Goethe and Hegel, an epoch had reached its conclusion, and our prevalent way of thinking – that is, the positivistic, natural-scientific one – cannot really be considered as philosophy.&quot; Jaspers also questions whether the two philosophers could be taught. For Kierkegaard, at least, Jaspers felt that Kierkegaard&#x27;s whole method of indirect communication precludes any attempts to properly expound his thought into any sort of systematic teaching.

Though Jaspers was certainly indebted to Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, he also owes much to Kant and Plato. Walter Kaufmann argues in &quot;From Shakespeare to Existentialism&quot; that, though Jaspers was certainly indebted to Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, he was closest to Kant&#x27;s philosophy:

Jaspers is too often seen as the heir of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard to whom he is in many ways less close than to Kant ... the Kantian antinomies and Kant&#x27;s concern with the realm of decision, freedom, and faith have become exemplary for Jaspers. And even as Kant &quot;had to do away with knowledge to make room for faith,&quot; Jaspers values Nietzsche in large measure because he thinks that Nietzsche did away with knowledge, thus making room for Jaspers&#x27; &quot;philosophic faith&quot;.
In his essay &quot;On My Philosophy&quot;, Jaspers states: &quot;While I was still at school Spinoza was the first. Kant then became the philosopher for me and has remained so ... Nietzsche gained importance for me only late as the magnificent revelation of nihilism and the task of overcoming it.&quot; Jaspers is also indebted to his contemporaries, such as Heinrich Blücher, from whom he borrowed the term, &quot;the anti-political principle&quot; to describe totalitarianism&#x27;s destruction of a space of resistance.

<text>A megalith is a large stone that has been used to construct a prehistoric structure or monument, either alone or together with other stones. There are over 35,000 structures or arrangements in Europe alone, located widely from Sweden to the Mediterranean sea.

The word was first used in 1849 by the British antiquarian Algernon Herbert in reference to Stonehenge and derives from the Ancient Greek words &quot;&quot; for great and &quot;&quot; for stone. Most extant megaliths were erected between the Neolithic period (although earlier Mesolithic examples are known) through the Chalcolithic period and into the Bronze Age.

==Types and definitions==

While &quot;megalith&quot; is often used to describe a single piece of stone, it also can be used to denote one or more rocks hewn in definite shapes for special purposes. It has been used to describe structures built by people from many parts of the world living in many different periods. The most widely known megaliths are not tombs.

===Single stones===

;Menhir: Menhir is the name used in Western Europe for a single upright stone erected in prehistoric times; sometimes called a &quot;standing stone&quot;.
;Monolith: Any single standing stone erected in prehistoric times.
;Capstone style: Single megaliths placed horizontally, often over burial chambers, without the use of support stones.

===Multiple stones===
;Alignments: Multiple megaliths placed in relation to each other with intention. Often placed in rows or spirals. Some alignments, such as the Carnac Stones in Brittany, France, consist of thousands of stones.
;Megalithic walls: Also called &quot;Cyclopean walls&quot;
;Stone circles: In most languages stone circles are called &quot;cromlechs&quot; (a word in the Welsh language); the word &quot;cromlech&quot; is sometimes used with that meaning in English.
;Dolmen: A dolmen is a stone table, consisting of a wide stone supported by several other stones
;Cist: A cist is a small stone-built coffin-like box or ossuary used to hold the bodies of the dead. Burials are megalithic forms very similar to dolmens in structure. These type of burials were completely underground.

==Timeline==
===Neolithic===
* 9000 BC: Constructions in Asia Minor, Turkey (Göbekli Tepe, Nevalı Çori and other sites); perhaps proto-Hattian, a yet to be named culture (the oldest discovered ceremonial structures in the world).
* 7400 BC: A 12 m long monolith probably weighing around 15,000 kg found submerged 40 m under water in the Strait of Sicily south-west of Sicily. Its origin and purpose are unknown.
* 7000 BC: Construction in proto-Canaanite Israel (Atlit Yam).
* 6000 BC: Constructions in Portugal (Almendres Cromlech, Évora) – Possibly first standing stones in Portugal.
* 5000 BC: Emergence of the Atlantic Neolithic period, the age of agriculture along the western shores of Europe during the sixth millennium BC pottery culture of La Almagra, Spain nearby, perhaps precedent from Africa.
* 4800 BC: Constructions in Brittany, France (Barnenez) and Poitou (Bougon).
* 4500 BC: Constructions in south Egypt (Nabta Playa).
* 4300 BC: Constructions in south Spain (Dolmen de Alberite, Cádiz).
* 4000 BC: Constructions in Brittany (Carnac), Portugal (Great Dolmen of Zambujeiro, Évora), France (central and southern), Corsica, Spain (Galicia), England and Wales, Constructions in Andalusia, Spain (Villa Martín, Cádiz), Construction in proto-Canaanite Israel c. 4000~3000 BC: Constructions in the rest of the proto-Canaanite Levant, e.g. Rujm el-Hiri and dolmens.
* 3700 BC: Constructions in Ireland (Knockiveagh and elsewhere).
* 3600 BC: Constructions in Malta (Skorba temples).
* 3600 BC: Constructions in England (Maumbury Rings and Godmanchester), and Malta (Ġgantija and Mnajdra temples).
* 3500 BC: Constructions in Spain (Málaga and Guadiana), Ireland (south-west), France (Arles and the north), Malta (and elsewhere in the Mediterranean), Belgium (north-east), and Germany (central and south-west).
* 3400 BC: Constructions in Sardinia (circular graves), Ireland (Newgrange), Netherlands (north-east), Germany (northern and central) Sweden and Denmark.
* 3300 BC: Constructions in France (Carnac stones)
* 3200 BC: Constructions in Malta (Ħaġar Qim and Tarxien).
* 3100 BC: Constructions in Russia (Dolmens of North Caucasus)

===Chalcolithic===

* 2500 BC: Constructions in Brittany (Le Menec, Kermario and elsewhere), Italy (Otranto), Sardinia, and Scotland (northeast), plus the climax of the megalithic Bell-beaker culture in Iberia, Germany, and the British Isles (stone circle at Stonehenge). With the bell-beakers, the Neolithic period gave way to the Chalcolithic, the age of copper.
* 2500 BC: Tombs at Algarve, Portugal. Additionally, a problematic dating (by optically stimulated luminescence) of Quinta da Queimada Menhir in western Algarve indicates &quot;a very early period of megalithic activity in the Algarve, older than in the rest of Europe and [similar to] the famous Anatolian site of Göbekli Tepe&quot;
* c. 2400 BC: The Bell-beaker culture was dominant in Britain, and hundreds of smaller stone circles were built in the British Isles at this time.

===Stone Age===
* 2100 BC:The highest plateau Lampung, West Lampung Regency, Batu Brak Liwa, Indonesia Megalith Site.
===Bronze Age===

* 2000 BC: Constructions in Brittany (Er Grah), Italy : (Bari); Sicily (Cava dei Servi, Cava Lazzaro);, and Scotland (Callanish). The Chalcolithic period gave way to the Bronze Age in western and northern Europe.
* 1800 BC: Constructions in Italy (Giovinazzo, in Sardinia started the Nuragic civilisation).
* 1500 BC: Constructions in Portugal (Alter Pedroso and Mourela).
* 1400 BC: Burial of the Egtved Girl in Denmark, whose body is today one of the best-preserved examples of its kind.
* 1200 BC: Last vestiges of the megalithic tradition in the Mediterranean and elsewhere following the Bronze Age Collapse. Megalithic construction persisted in Egypt into the Iron Age.

==Geographic distribution of megaliths==
===European megaliths===

The most common type of megalithic construction in Europe is the portal tomb—a chamber consisting of upright stones (orthostats) with one or more large flat capstones forming a roof. Many portal tombs have been found to contain human remains, but it is debated if their primary function was use as burial sites. The megalithic structures in the northwest of France are believed to be the oldest in Europe based on radiocarbon dating. Though generally known as &quot;dolmens&quot;, the term most accepted by archaeologists is &quot;portal tomb&quot;. Local names for portal tombs exist in multiple locations, such as &quot;anta&quot; in Galicia and Portugal, &quot;stazzone&quot; in Sardinia, &quot;hunebed&quot; in the Netherlands, &quot;Hünengrab&quot; in Germany, &quot;dysse&quot; in Denmark, and &quot;cromlech&quot; in Wales. It is assumed that most portal tombs were originally covered by earthen mounds.

The second-most-common tomb type is the passage grave. It normally consists of a square, circular, or cruciform chamber with a slabbed or corbelled roof, accessed by a long, straight passageway, with the whole structure covered by a circular mound of earth. Sometimes it is also surrounded by an external stone kerb. Prominent examples include the sites of Brú na Bóinne and Carrowmore in Ireland, Maes Howe in Orkney, and Gavrinis in France.

The third tomb type is a diverse group known as gallery graves. These are axially arranged chambers placed under elongated mounds. The Irish court tombs, British long barrows, and German &quot;Steinkisten&quot; belong to this group.

Standing stones, or menhirs as they are known in France, are very common throughout Europe, where some 50,000 examples have been noted. Some of these are thought to have an astronomical function as a marker or foresight. In some areas, long and complex &quot;alignments&quot; of such stones exist, the largest known example being located at Carnac in Brittany, France.

In parts of Britain and Ireland a relatively common type of megalithic construction is the stone circle, of which examples include Stonehenge, Avebury, Ring of Brodgar and Beltany. These, too, display evidence of astronomical alignments, both solar and lunar. Stonehenge, for example, is famous for its solstice alignment. Examples of stone circles are also found in the rest of Europe. The circle at Lough Gur, near Limerick in Ireland has been dated to the Beaker period, approximately contemporaneous with Stonehenge. The stone circles are assumed to be of later date than the tombs, straddling the Neolithic and the Bronze Ages.

====Tombs====

Megalithic tombs are aboveground burial chambers, built of large stone slabs (megaliths) laid on edge and covered with earth or other, smaller stones. They are a type of chamber tomb, and the term is used to describe the structures built across Atlantic Europe, the Mediterranean, and neighbouring regions, mostly during the Neolithic period, by Neolithic farming communities. They differ from the contemporary long barrows through their structural use of stone.
There is a huge variety of megalithic tombs. The free-standing single chamber dolmens and portal dolmens found in Brittany, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, Wales, and elsewhere consist of a large flat stone supported by three, four, or more standing stones. They were covered by a stone cairn or earth barrow.

In Italy, dolmens can be found especially in Sardinia. There are more than 100 dolmen dating to the Neolithic (3500–2700 BC) and the most famous is called &quot;Dolmen di Sa Coveccada&quot; (near Mores). During the Bronze Age, the Nuragic civilization built c. 800 Giants&#x27; grave, a type of megalithic gallery grave that can be found throughout Sardinia with different structures. The earliest megalithic tombs in Sardinia are the circular graves of the so-called Arzachena culture, also found in Corsica, southern France and eastern Spain.
Dolmens are also in Apulia and in Sicily. In this latter region, they are small structures located in Mura Pregne (Palermo), Sciacca (Agrigento), Monte Bubbonia (Caltanissetta), Butera (Caltanissetta), Cava Lazzaro (Siracusa), Cava dei Servi (Ragusa), Avola (Siracusa), and Argimusco in Montalbano Elicona (Messina). Dating to the Early Bronze Age (2200–1800 BC), the prehistoric Sicilian buildings were covered by a circular mound of earth. In the dolmen of Cava dei Servi, archaeologists found numerous human bone fragments and some splinters of Castelluccian ceramics (Early Bronze Age) which confirmed the burial purpose of the artefact.

Examples with outer areas, not used for burial, are also known. The Court Cairns of southwest Scotland and northern Ireland, the Severn-Cotswold tombs of southwest England and the transepted gallery graves of the Loire region in France share many internal features, although the links between them are not yet fully understood. That they often have antechambers or forecourts is thought to imply a desire on the part of the builders to emphasize a special ritual or physical separation of the dead from the living.
Megalithic tombs appear to have been used by communities for the long-term deposition of the remains of their dead, and some seem to have undergone alteration and enlargement. The organization and effort required to erect these large stones suggest that the societies concerned placed great emphasis on the proper treatment of their dead. The ritual significance of the tombs is supported by the presence of pre-historic art carved into the stones at some sites. Hearths and deposits of pottery and animal bone found by archaeologists around some tombs also implies that some form of burial feast or sacrificial rites took place there.

Further examples of megalithic tombs include the stalled cairn at Midhowe in Orkney and the passage grave at Bryn Celli Ddu on Anglesey. There are also extensive grave sites with up to 60 megaliths at Louisenlund and Gryet on the Danish island of Bornholm.

Despite its name, the Stone Tomb in Ukraine was not a tomb but rather a sanctuary.

====Other structures====
In association with the megalithic constructions across Europe, there are often large earthworks of various designs—ditches and banks (like the Dorset Cursus), broad terraces, circular enclosures known as henges, and frequently artificial mounds such as Silbury Hill in England and Monte d&#x27;Accoddi in Sardinia (the prehistoric step pyramid).

====Spread of megalithic architecture in Europe====

In Europe megaliths are, in general, constructions erected during the Neolithic or late Stone Age and Chalcolithic or Copper Age (4500–1500 BC). The megalithic structures of Malta are believed to be the oldest in Europe. Perhaps the most famous megalithic structure is Stonehenge in England.
In Sardinia, in addition to dolmens, menhirs and circular graves there are also more than 8000 megalithic structures made by a Nuragic civilisation, called Nuraghe: buildings similar to towers (sometimes with really complex structures) made using only rocks. They are often near giant&#x27;s grave or the other megalithic monuments.

The French Comte de Caylus was the first to describe the Carnac stones. Pierre Jean-Baptiste Legrand d&#x27;Aussy introduced the terms &quot;menhir&quot; and &quot;dolmen&quot;, both taken from the Breton language, into antiquarian terminology. He mistakenly interpreted megaliths as Gallic tombs. In Britain, the antiquarians Aubrey and Stukeley conducted early research into megaliths. In 1805, Jacques Cambry published a book called &quot;Monuments celtiques, ou recherches sur le culte des Pierres, précédées d&#x27;une notice sur les Celtes et sur les Druides, et suivies d&#x27;Etymologie celtiques&quot;, where he proposed a Celtic stone cult. This unproven connection between druids and megaliths has haunted the public imagination ever since. In Belgium, there are the Wéris megaliths at Wéris, a little town situated in the Ardennes. In the Netherlands, megalithic structures can be found in the northeast of the country, mostly in the province of Drenthe. Knowth is a passage grave of the Brú na Bóinne neolithic complex in Ireland, dating from c. 3500–3000 BC. It contains more than a third of the total number of examples of megalithic art in all Europe, with over 200 decorated stones found during excavations.

===African megaliths===

====North Africa====
Nabta Playa at the southwest corner of the western Egyptian desert was once a large lake in the Nubian Desert, located 500 miles south of modern-day Cairo. By the 5th millennium BC, the peoples in Nabta Playa had fashioned an astronomical device that accurately marks the summer solstice. Findings indicate that the region was occupied only seasonally, likely only in the summer when the local lake filled with water for grazing cattle. There are other megalithic stone circles in the southwestern desert.

At Nabta Playa, located in Egypt and broader region of the Eastern Sahara, there is a megalithic cultural complex (e.g., sacrificed cow burial site, solar calendar, altar) that dates between 4000 BCE and 2000 BCE.
Likely part of Copper Age and Bronze Age cultural traditions of megalith-building, megaliths (e.g., dolmens) were constructed in Mediterranean North Africa.

====West Africa====

In Cross-River State, Nigeria, there are megalithic monoliths of an anthropomorphic nature.
At Tondidarou, in the Malian Lakes Region, there are megaliths of an anthropomorphic nature (e.g., face, navel, scarifications) that date between 600 CE and 700 CE.
Between 1350 BCE and 1500/1600 CE, Senegambian megaliths (e.g., tumuli) were constructed for the purpose of ancestral reverence.

====Central Africa====

In the northwestern region of the Central African Republic, there are megaliths that were created for various purposes (e.g., burial, ritual performances).
Between late 3rd millennium BCE and mid-2nd millennium CE, megaliths (e.g., monuments, cairn burials) were constructed in the regions (e.g., Eastern Adamawa, Oubanguian Ridge, Chad/Congo watershed) in Central African Republic and Cameroon, throughout various periods (e.g., Balimbé: 2000 BCE – 1000 BCE; Early Gbabiri: 950 BCE – 200 BCE; Late Gbabiri: 200 BCE – 500 CE; Bouboun: 500 CE – 1600 CE), for various purposes (e.g., ritual practices, territorial marking).

====Eastern Africa====

In the Ethiopian Highlands of Harar, the earliest construction of megaliths occurred. From this region and its megalith-building tradition (e.g., dolmens, tumuli with burial chambers organized in cemeteries), the subsequent traditions in other areas of Ethiopia likely developed. In the late 1st millennium BCE, the urban civilization of Axum developed a megalithic stelae-building tradition, which commemorated Axumite royalty and elites, that persisted until the Christian period of Axum. In the Sidamo Province, the megalithic monoliths of the stelae-building cultural tradition were utilized as tombstones in cemeteries (e.g., Arussi, Konso, Sedene, Tiya, Tuto Felo), and have engraved anthropomorphic features (e.g., swords, masks), phallic form, and some of that served as markers of territory. Sidamo Province has the most megaliths in Ethiopia.
In 2nd millennium BCE, Namoratunga (Monolith Circles) megaliths were constructed as burials the eastern Turkana region of northwestern Kenya.

Namoratunga, a group of megaliths dated 300 BC, was used by Cushitic-speaking people as an alignment with star systems tuned to a lunar calendar of 354 days. This site was excavated by B. N. Lynch and L. H. Robins of Michigan State University.

Additionally, Tiya in central Ethiopia has a number of old megaliths. Some of these ancient structures feature engravings, and the area is a World Heritage Site. Megaliths are also found within the Valley of Marvels in the East Hararghe area.

====Southern Africa====

In the mid-2nd millennium CE, the megalithic funerary monuments of Madagascar were constructed amid the emergent period of the Merina Kingdom. Some of the megaliths remain utilized by Malagasy-speakers for funerary practices (e.g., ceremony of turning the dead) in present-day.

===Asian megaliths===

Megalithic burials are found in Northeast and Southeast Asia. They are found mainly in the Korean Peninsula. They are also found in the Liaoning, Shandong, and Zhejiang in China, the East Coast of Taiwan, Kyūshū and Shikoku in Japan, Đồng Nai Province in Vietnam and South Asia. Some living megalithic traditions are found on the island of Sumba and Nias in Indonesia. The greatest concentration of megalithic burials is in Korea. Archaeologists estimate that there are 15,000 to 100,000 southern megaliths in the Korean Peninsula. Typical estimates hover around the 30,000 mark for the entire peninsula, which in itself constitutes some 40% of all dolmens worldwide (see Dolmen).

====North East Asia====

=====Northern style=====
Northeast Asian megalithic traditions originated from Gojoseon, which was in modern-day Manchuria and North Korea. This was prominent within the Liao River basin in particular in the early phases. The practice of erecting megalithic burials spread quickly from the Liao River Basin and into the Korean Peninsula, where the structure of megaliths is geographically and chronologically distinct. The earliest megalithic burials are called &quot;northern&quot; or &quot;table-style&quot; because they feature an above-ground burial chamber formed by heavy stone slabs that form a rectangular cist. An oversized capstone is placed over the stone slab burial chamber, giving the appearance of a table-top. These megalithic burials date to the early part of the Mumun pottery period (c. 1500–850 BC) and are distributed, with a few exceptions, north of the Han River. Few northern-style megaliths in North Korea and Manchuria contain grave goods such as Liaoning bronze daggers, prompting some archaeologists to interpret the burials as the graves of chiefs or preeminent individuals. However, whether a result of grave-robbery or intentional mortuary behaviour, most northern megaliths contain no grave goods.

=====Southern style=====

Southern-style megalithic burials are distributed in the southern Korean Peninsula. It is thought that most of them date to the latter part of the Early Mumun or to the Middle Mumun Period. Southern-style megaliths are typically smaller in scale than northern megaliths. The interment area of southern megaliths has an underground burial chamber made of earth or lined with thin stone slabs. A massive capstone is placed over the interment area and is supported by smaller propping stones. Most of the megalithic burials on the Korean Peninsula are of the southern type.

As with northern megaliths, southern examples contain few, if any, artifacts. However, a small number of megalithic burials contain fine red-burnished pottery, bronze daggers, polished groundstone daggers, and greenstone ornaments. Southern megalithic burials are often found in groups, spread out in lines that are parallel with the direction of streams. Megalithic cemeteries contain burials that are linked together by low stone platforms made from large river cobbles. Broken red-burnished pottery and charred wood found on these platforms has led archaeologists to hypothesize that these platform were sometimes used for ceremonies and rituals. The capstones of many southern megaliths have &#x27;cup-marks&#x27; carvings. A small number of capstones have human and dagger representations.

=====Capstone style=====

These megaliths are distinguished from other types by the presence of a burial shaft, sometimes up to 4 m in depth, which is lined with large cobbles. A large capstone is placed over the burial shaft without propping stones. Capstone-style megaliths are the most monumental type in the Korean Peninsula, and they are primarily distributed near or on the south coast of Korea. It seems that most of these burials date to the latter part of the Middle Mumun (c. 700–550 BC), and they may have been built into the early part of the Late Mumun. An example is found near modern Changwon at Deokcheon-ni, where a small cemetery contained a capstone burial (No. 1) with a massive, rectangularly shaped, stone and earthen platform. Archaeologists were not able to recover the entire feature, but the low platform was at least 56×18 m in size.

====Southeast Asia====
=====Living megalith culture of Indonesia=====
The Indonesian archipelago is the host of Austronesian and Melanesians megalith cultures both past and present. Living megalith cultures can be found on Nias, an isolated island off the western coast of North Sumatra, the Batak people in the interior of North Sumatra, on Flores and Sumba island in East Nusa Tenggara and also Toraja people from the interior of South Sulawesi. These megalith cultures remained preserved, isolated and undisturbed well into the late 19th century.

Several megalith sites and structures are also found across Indonesia. Menhirs, dolmens, stone tables, and ancestral stone statues were discovered in various sites in Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi, Lesser Sunda Islands, and New Guinea.

The Cipari megalith site also in West Java displays monoliths, stone terraces, and sarcophagi.

Lore Lindu National Park in Central Sulawesi houses ancient megalith relics such as ancestral stone statues, mostly located in the Bada, Besoa and Napu valleys.

==== South Asia ====
Megaliths in South Asia are dated before 3000 BC, with recent findings dated back to 5000 BC in southern India. Megaliths are found in almost all parts of South Asia. There is also a broad time evolution with the megaliths in central India and the upper Indus valley where the oldest megaliths are found, while those in the east also old shows evidence of continued traditions of living megalithic practices until recently. A large fraction of these are assumed to be associated with burial or post burial rituals, including memorials for those whose remains may or may not be available. The case-example is that of Brahmagiri, which was excavated by Wheeler (1975) and helped establish the culture sequence in south Indian prehistory. However, there is another distinct class of megaliths that do not seem to be associated with burials.
In South Asia, megaliths of all kinds are noted; these vary from menhirs, rock-cut burial, chamber tomb, dolmens, stone alignment, stone circles and anthropomorphic statue figures. These are broadly classified into two (potentially overlapping) classes (after Moorti, 1994, 2008): &quot;Sepulchral&quot; (containing remains of the dead), or memorial stones where mortal remains along with funerary objects are placed; and &quot;Non-sepulchral&quot; including large patterned placement of stones over a wide area. The &#x27;non-sepulchral&#x27; type is associated with astronomy and cosmology in South Asia and in other parts of the world (Menon and Vahia, 2010).

In the context of prehistoric anthropomorphic figures in India, (Rao 1988/1999, Upinder Singh 2008) note that it is unclear what these giant anthropomorph statues symbolize. They usually occur in association with megalithic monuments and are located in megalithic burial grounds, and may have been connected with ancestor worship.

====West Asia====

At a number of sites in southeastern Turkey, ceremonial complexes with large T-shaped megalithic orthostats, dating from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN, 9600–7000 cal BC), have been discovered.

At the most famous of these sites, Göbekli Tepe, parts of the oldest level (III) have been C14-dated as far back as to the mid-10th millennium BC (cal). On this level, 20 great stone circles (up to 20 meters in diameter) with standing stones up to 7 meters high have been identified. At least 5 of these circles have so far (as of 2019) been excavated. Many of the standing stones are richly ornamented with carved reliefs of &quot;[b]ears, boars, snakes, foxes, wildcats, aurochs, gazelle, quadruped reptiles, birds, spiders, insects, quadrupeds, scorpions&quot; and other animals; in addition, some of the stones are carved in low profile with stylized human features (arms, hands, loincloths, but &quot;no heads&quot;).

On the younger level (II) rectangular structures with smaller megaliths have been excavated. In the surrounding area, several village sites incorporating elements similar to those of Göbekli Tepe have been identified. Four of these have Göbekli Tepe&#x27;s characteristic T-shaped standing stones, though only one of them, Nevalı Çori, has so far been excavated. At Göbekli Tepe itself, no traces of habitation have so far been found, nor any trace of agriculture or cultivated plants, though bones of wild animals and traces of wild edible plants, along with many grinding stones, have been unearthed. It is thus assumed that these structures (which have been characterized as the first known ceremonial architecture) were erected by hunter-gatherers.

Göbekli Tepe&#x27;s oldest structures are about 7,000 years older than the Stonehenge megaliths, although it is doubtful that any of the European megalithic traditions (see below) are derived from them. 
Dolmens and standing stones have been found in large areas in other parts of West Asia starting at the Turkish border in the north of Syria close to Aleppo, southwards down to Yemen. They can be encountered in Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. The largest concentration can be found in southern Syria and along the Jordan Rift Valley; these are threatened with destruction. They date from the late Chalcolithic or Early Bronze Age. Megaliths have also been found on Kharg Island and Pirazmian in Iran, at Barda Balka in Iraq.
A semicircular arrangement of megaliths was found in Israel at Atlit Yam, a site that is now under the sea. It is a very early example, dating from the 7th millennium BC.

The most concentrated occurrence of dolmens in particular is in a large area on both sides of the Jordan Rift Valley, with greater predominance on the eastern side. They occur first and foremost on the Golan Heights, the Hauran, and in Jordan, which probably has the largest concentration of dolmen in West Asia. In Saudi Arabia, only very few dolmen have been identified so far in the Hejaz. They seem, however, to re-emerge in Yemen in small numbers, and thus could indicate a continuous tradition related to those of Somalia and Ethiopia.
The standing stone has a very ancient tradition in West Asia, dating back from Mesopotamian times. Although not always &#x27;megalithic&#x27; in the true sense, they occur throughout the area and can reach 5 metres or more in some cases (such as at Ader in Jordan). This phenomenon can also be traced through many passages from the Old Testament, such as those related to Jacob, the grandson of Abraham, who poured oil over a stone that he erected after his famous dream in which angels climbed to heaven (Genesis 28:10–22). Jacob is also described as putting up stones at other occasions, whereas Moses erected twelve pillars symbolizing the tribes of Israel. The tradition of venerating standing stones continued in Nabatean times.
Related phenomena, such as cupholes, rock-cut tombs and circles, also occur in West Asia.

===Melanesian megaliths===
Megaliths occur in many parts of Melanesia, mainly in Milne Bay Province, Fiji and Vanuatu. Few excavations have been made and little is known about the structures.
The megalith tomb Otuyam at Kiriwina has been dated to be approximately 2,000 years old which indicates that megaliths are an old custom in Melanesia. However very few megaliths have been dated. The constructions have been used for different rituals. For example, tombs, sacrifices and rituals of fecundity. Dance sites exist next to some megaliths. In some places in Melanesia rituals are continued to be held at the sacred megalith sites. The fact that the beliefs are alive is a reason that most excavations have been stopped at the sites.

===Micronesian megaliths===
Megalithic structures in Micronesia reach their most developed form on the islands of Pohnpei and Kosrae in the Eastern Caroline Islands. On these two islands there was extensive use of prismatic basalt columns to build upland building complexes such as those at Salapwuk on Pohnpei and Menka on Kosrae. These building sites, remote from the ocean, appear to have been abandoned early. Megalithic building then shifted to constructing networks of artificial islands on the coast that supported a multitude of common, royal and religious structures. Dating of the structures is difficult but the complex at Nan Madol on Pohnpei was probably inhabited as early as c. 800, probably as artificial islands, with the more elaborate buildings and religious structures added to the site from 1000 to 1400 AD.

==Modern theories==
===Purposes===
Megaliths were used for a variety of purposes ranging from serving as boundary markers of territory, being reminder of past events, to being part of the society&#x27;s religion. Common motifs including crooks and axes seem to be symbols of political power, much as the crook was a symbol of Egyptian pharaohs. Amongst the indigenous peoples of India, Malaysia, Polynesia, North Africa, North America, and South America, the worship of these stones, or the use of these stones to symbolize a spirit or deity, is a possibility. In the early 20th century, some scholars believed that all megaliths belonged to one global &quot;Megalithic culture&quot; (hyperdiffusionism, e.g. &quot;the Manchester school&quot;, by Grafton Elliot Smith and William James Perry), but this has long been disproved by modern dating methods. Nor is it believed any longer that there was a pan-European megalithic culture, although regional cultures existed, even within such small areas as the British Isles. The archaeologist Euan Mackie wrote, &quot;Likewise it cannot be doubted that important regional cultures existed in the Neolithic period and can be defined by different kinds of stone circles and local pottery styles (Ruggles &amp; Barclay 2000: figure 1). No-one has ever been rash enough to claim a nationwide unity of all aspects of Neolithic archaeology!&quot;.

===Methods of construction===
Much scholarship over history has suggested that Stone Age peoples moved the large stones on cylindrical wooden rollers. However, there is some disagreement with this theory, specifically as experiments have indicated that this method is impractical on uneven ground. In some contemporary megalith building cultures, such as in Sumba, Indonesia, great emphasis is placed on the social status of moving heavy stones without the relief of rollers. In the majority of documented contemporary megalithic-building communities, the stones have been placed on timber sledges and dragged without rollers.

=== Types of megalithic structure ===
The types of megalithic structure can be divided into two categories, the &quot;polylithic type&quot; and the &quot;monolithic type&quot;. Different megalithic structures include:

==Contemporary megalith-building cultures==
===The Toraja of Indonesia===
The megalithic culture of the Toraja people in the mountainous region of South Sulawesi, Indonesia dates back to around 2500–1000 BC.

===The Marapu of Indonesia===
In West Sumba, Indonesia, the more than 20,000 followers of the Marapu animist religion construct monolithic tombs by hand. Originally built with slave labor, the large tombs of nobles are now built by a class of dependents who are paid either in animals or cash (an amount equal to $0.65–0.90 per day). The tombs are planned long in advance, with families sometimes going into extreme debt to finance the construction. In 1971, one leading family sacrificed 350 buffalo over the course of a year in order to feed the 1,000 people necessary to drag the capstone 3 km from the quarry to the tombsite.

Quarrying the stones for a tomb can take almost a month and typically involves 20–40 laborours, sometimes subcontracted by a relative. It can be months or years before the stones are actually transported to the gravesite, which is done traditionally by hand, using a wooden sled and rollers with the help of many members of the family&#x27;s clan. Building the sled itself can take several days, and typically males between the ages of 10–60 are assembled to pull the stone from the quarry to the tombsite. Smaller capstones may be moved by a few hundred members of a clan, but larger ones can involve upwards of 2,000 individuals over many days.
Sometimes the stones are draped with woven cloths given as gifts by relatives of the owner. The sidewalls are smaller and usually require fewer participants. The entire process is accompanied by large feasts and ritual singers provided by the owner. Some contemporary practitioners now choose to use large machinery and trucks to move the stones.

Once on site, the stones were traditionally assembled and mortared with a mix of water buffalo dung and ash, but are now more commonly cemented together. Typically, the walls are assembled first, and then the capstone is incrementally elevated to the height of the walls by means of a wood scaffolding which is inserted log by log at alternating ends. Once the capstone is at the correct height beside the walls it is slid into place above the tomb. Alternately, some tombs are constructed by dragging the capstone up a fabricated ramp and then assembling the sidewalls below it, before removing the ramp structure to let the capstone rest upon the walls. Often, but not always, the finished structure is decorated by a professional stone carver with symbolic motifs. The carving alone can at times take over a month to complete.

<text>Braulio Castillo Jr. (born August 30, 1958) is a Puerto Rican actor and radio host. He is the son of Braulio Castillo, an actor across Latin America, and the brother of the lesser known Jorge Castillo, also a television and theater actor.

==Biography==
For a short time during the 1970s, he was first known in Puerto Rico doing newsbreaks for WKBM-TV Channel 11 in Caguas, now Univision O&amp;O WLII.

Castillo reached national fame in Puerto Rico when he participated in the 1984 Spanish soap opera &quot;Coralito&quot; at San Juan-based WKAQ-TV Channel 2. There, he shared star billing with Mexican actor Salvador Pineda and with Puerto Rican actress Sully Diaz. Afterwards, Castillo reached teen idol status across Puerto Rico. In 1985, he was one of the stars of the successful telenovela&quot;Tanairi&quot;, alongside actress Von Marie Mendez. That year (1985), Castillo was hired to co-host a game show named &quot;Adelante Juventud&quot; (&quot;Come on, Youth&quot;) alongside Myraida Chaves. He also starred in three telenovelas alongside fellow Puerto Rican actress Millie Aviles.

Castillo subsequently acted on numerous telenovelas in Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.

In the 1990s he starred in the sitcom,&quot;Tres Hombres y...&quot;, inspired by the movie &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;, alongside Raymond Arrieta and Alba Nydia Díaz on the WKAQ-TV Telemundo de Puerto Rico network. Castillo also was the leading man of the telenovela &quot;Karina Montaner&quot;, opposite Giselle Blondet, broadcast by WAPA-TV Channel 4 in San Juan. For several years, Braulio starred in various soap operas in Colombia.

In 2003, Castillo starred in the film &quot;Los Diaz de Doris&quot;, alongside Cordelia Gonzalez and Velda González, Kidany Lugo and former Major League Baseball player Cirilo Cruz.

In 2006, he performed the role of Zacks in the musical &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, at the Caguas Performing Arts Center, alongside Marian Pabón and Daniela Droz, among others. Castillo was acknowledged not only for his acting, but for his phenomenal attributes as a stage dancer.

Starting in 2007, he co-hosted a daily radio morning talk show alongside Mirayda Chaves while keeping on performing in numerous theatre productions in San Juan.

Also in 2007, Castillo performed the leading role in director Jacobo Morales&#x27;s film &quot;Ángel&quot;.

In 2011 he starred in the Puerto Rican premiere of Yasmina Reza&#x27;s play God of Carnage at the Tapia Theatre in San Juan.

He starred in the Puerto Rican production of Jerry Herman&#x27;s La Cage Aux Folles as Georges, opening in August 2013 at the Luis A Ferré Performing Arts Center in San Juan.

Early in 2014, Castillo revealed that he had battled prostate cancer in 2011.

On early October 2020, he revealed that he had gone through an emotional crisis, due to a personal situation as well as the uncertainty of the pandemic, which lead for him to seek help at the hospital for depression symptoms.

Richmond was born to General Lord George Lennox, the younger son of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, and Lady Louisa, daughter of William Kerr, 4th Marquess of Lothian. His aunts included the famous four Lennox sisters.

==Cricket==
Richmond was a keen cricketer. He was an accomplished right-hand bat and a noted wicket-keeper. An amateur, he was a founder member of the Marylebone Cricket Club. In 1786, together with the Earl of Winchilsea, Richmond offered Thomas Lord a guarantee against any losses Lord might suffer on starting a new cricket ground. This led to Lord opening his first cricket ground in 1787. Although Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground has since moved twice, Richmond and Winchilsea&#x27;s guarantee provided the genesis of the best-known cricket ground in the world, a ground known as the Home of Cricket. Nearly always listed as the Hon. Colonel Charles Lennox in contemporary scorecards, Richmond had 55 recorded first-class appearances from 1784 to 1800 and played a few more games after that.

==Army general==
Richmond became a British Army captain at the age of 23 in 1787. On 27 May 1789, while a colonel in the Duke of York&#x27;s regiment, he was involved in a duel with Frederick, Duke of York, who had expressed the opinion that &quot;Colonel Lennox had heard words spoken to him at Daughbigny&#x27;s, to which no gentleman ought to have submitted&quot;, effectively an accusation of failing to respond to an insult in the way that a gentleman should. At Wimbledon Common, His Highness was attended by Lord Rawdon, Richmond by the Earl of Winchilsea. Richmond fired, but his ball &quot;grazed his Royal Highness&#x27;s curl&quot;; the Duke did not fire. Richmond shortly after exchanged his company for the commission of a lieutenant-colonel in the 35th Regiment of Foot.

On 1 July of the same year, he was involved in another duel, with Theophilus Swift, Esq., in consequence of a pamphlet criticising Richmond&#x27;s character published under Swift&#x27;s name. They met in a field near Uxbridge Road, where Swift was wounded in the body, but recovered. 

Later in the year, he married Lady Charlotte Gordon. In 1794 and 1795 he participated in naval engagements against the French in the West Indies and Gibraltar, but was sent home when he came into conflict with his superiors. He was also MP for Sussex, succeeding his father, from 1790 until he succeeded to the dukedom.

==Duke==

He became the 4th Duke of Richmond on 29 December 1806, after the death of his uncle, Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond. In April 1807 he became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He remained in that post until 1813. He participated in the Napoleonic Wars and in 1815 he was in command of a reserve force in Brussels, which was protecting that city in case Napoleon won the Battle of Waterloo. On 15 June, the night before the Battle of Quatre Bras, his wife held a ball for his fellow officers. The glittering celebration became famous as the Duchess of Richmond&#x27;s ball and was immortalised by William Makepeace Thackeray in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and by Lord Byron in &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;.

Although the Duke observed the Battle of Quatre Bras the next day, as well as Waterloo on 18 June, he did not participate in either, his role being in the defence of the city of Brussels.

==Governor General of Canada==
In 1818 he was appointed Governor-General of British North America.

During the summer of 1819, Richmond was undertaking a tour of Upper and Lower Canada on an inspection of a planned route for the Rideau Canal, when he was bitten on the hand by a fox. The injury apparently healed and he continued on the tour, but later in his journey, the initial symptoms of hydrophobia appeared, a clear sign of rabies. After the disease had developed rapidly, he died on 28 August. Richmond&#x27;s body was returned to Quebec, where he was buried at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity on 4 September.

The night before his death, he slept at the &quot;Masonic Arms&quot;, which was renamed the &quot;Duke of Richmond Arms&quot; to commemorate the visit.

Richmond&#x27;s title was inherited by his son, Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond.

==Legacy==

* Huntley Township, Ontario
* Torbolton Township, Ontario
* Fitzroy Township, Ontario

According to tradition, the town of Richmond Hill, Ontario, was also named after him, as he was said to have passed through the then village during his visit in 1819.
Richmond Park in Inchicore, Dublin, still bears his name. Now the home ground of St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic Football Club, it was once a part of Richmond Barracks as Richmond was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1807–1813). It was to these barracks that over 3,000 prisoners were brought after the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin. After independence, the barracks were renamed Keogh Barracks and later redeveloped as housing for the capital&#x27;s poor and again renamed Keogh Square.

==Children==

Richmond had fourteen children:

* Lady Mary Lennox (15 August 17907 December 1847), married Sir Charles Fitzroy and had issue.
* Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond (3 August 179121 October 1860), married Lady Caroline Paget and had issue.
* Lt.-Col. Lord John George Lennox (3 October 179310 November 1873), married Louisa Rodney and had issue.
* Lady Sarah Lennox (c. 17948 September 1873), scandalised her family by eloping after Waterloo with Waterloo hero, General Peregrine Maitland, 17 years her senior. The courtship had gone unnoticed by her family. The Duke of Wellington arranged for the couple to be married in Paris and fostered the family&#x27;s ultimate acceptance of the marriage.
* Lady Georgiana Lennox (30 September 179515 December 1891), was a close friend of the Duke of Wellington, despite being 26 years younger than the Duke who referred to her as &quot;dearest Georgy&quot; in their many years of written correspondence. There are hints that the relationship may have been sexual, including his gift of a miniature to her on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo, and a pause in their written correspondence for ten years after Waterloo. She was also fond of Colonel Frederick Ponsonby whose recovery after Waterloo she fretted over. After she married William FitzGerald-de Ros, 22nd Baron de Ros, with whom she had issue, she resumed corresponding with Wellington until his death 27 years later. 
* Lord Henry Adam Lennox (6 September 17971812), fell overboard from HMS &quot;Blake&quot; and drowned.
* Lord William Lennox (20 September 179918 February 1881), married first Mary Ann Paton and second Ellen Smith; had issue by the latter.
* Lady Jane Lennox (c. 180027 March 1861), married Laurence Peel and had issue.
* Captain Lord Frederick Lennox (24 January 180125 October 1829).
* Lord Sussex Lennox (11 June 180212 April 1874), married Hon. Mary Lawless and had issue.
* Lady Louisa Maddelena Lennox (2 October 18032 March 1900), married Rt. Hon. William Tighe, died without issue.
* Lady Charlotte Lennox (c. 180420 August 1833), married Maurice Berkeley, 1st Baron FitzHardinge of Bristol, and had issue.
* Lt.-Col. Lord Arthur Lennox (2 October 180615 January 1864), married Adelaide Campbell and had issue.
* Lady Sophia Georgiana Lennox (21 July 180917 January 1902), married Lord Thomas Cecil, died without issue.

<text>A Gabriel&#x27;s horn (also called Torricelli&#x27;s trumpet) is a type of geometric figure that has infinite surface area but finite volume. The name refers to the Christian tradition where the archangel Gabriel blows the horn to announce Judgment Day. The properties of this figure were first studied by Italian physicist and mathematician Evangelista Torricelli in the 17th century.

These colourful informal names and the allusion to religion came along later.
Torricelli&#x27;s own name for it is to be found in the Latin title of his paper , written in 1643, a truncated acute hyperbolic solid, cut by a plane.
Volume 1, part 1 of his published the following year included that paper and a second more orthodox (for the time) Archimedean proof of its theorem about the volume of a truncated acute hyperbolic solid.
This name was used in mathematical dictionaries of the 18th century, including &quot;Hyperbolicum Acutum&quot; in Harris&#x27; 1704 dictionary and in Stone&#x27;s 1726 one, and the French translation in d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s 1751 one.

Although credited with primacy by his contemporaries, Torricelli was not the first to describe an infinitely long shape with a finite volume or area.
The work of Nicole Oresme in the 14th century had either been forgotten by, or was unknown to them.
Oresme had posited such things as an infinitely long shape constructed by subdividing two squares of finite total area 2 using a geometric series and rearranging the parts into a figure, infinitely long in one dimension, comprising a series of rectangles.

==Mathematical definition==

Gabriel&#x27;s horn is formed by taking the graph of
formula_1
with the domain formula_2 and rotating it in three dimensions about the  axis. The discovery was made using Cavalieri&#x27;s principle before the invention of calculus, but today, calculus can be used to calculate the volume and surface area of the horn between and , where . Using integration (see Solid of revolution and Surface of revolution for details), it is possible to find the volume and the surface area :
formula_3
formula_4

The value can be as large as required, but it can be seen from the equation that the volume of the part of the horn between and will never exceed ; however, it does gradually draw nearer to as increases. Mathematically, the volume &quot;approaches&quot; as &quot;approaches&quot; infinity. Using the limit notation of calculus,
formula_5

The surface area formula above gives a lower bound for the area as 2 times the natural logarithm of . There is no upper bound for the natural logarithm of , as approaches infinity. That means, in this case, that the horn has an infinite surface area. That is to say,
formula_6

=== In ===

Torricelli&#x27;s original non-calculus proof used an object, slightly different to the aforegiven, that was constructed by truncating the acute hyperbolic solid with a plane perpendicular to the &quot;x&quot; axis and extending it from the opposite side of that plane with a cylinder of the same base.
Whereas the calculus method proceeds by setting the plane of truncation at formula_7 and integrating along the &quot;x&quot; axis, Torricelli proceeded by calculating the volume of this compound solid (with the added cylinder) by summing the surface areas of a series of concentric right cylinders within it along the &quot;y&quot; axis and showing that this was equivalent to summing areas within another solid whose (finite) volume was known.

In modern terminology this solid was created by constructing a surface of revolution of the function (for strictly positive )

formula_8 

and Torricelli&#x27;s theorem was that its volume is the same as the volume of the right cylinder with height formula_9 and radius formula_10:
Torricelli showed that the volume of the solid could be derived from the surface areas of this series of concentric right cylinders whose radii were formula_11 and heights formula_12.
Substituting in the formula for the surface areas of (just the sides of) these cylinders yields a constant surface area for all cylinders of formula_13.
This is also the area of a circle of radius formula_14 and the nested surfaces of the cylinders (filling the volume of the solid) are thus equivalent to the stacked areas of the circles of radius formula_10 stacked from 0 to formula_9, and hence the volume of the aforementioned right cylinder, which is known to be formula_17:
(The volume of the added cylinder is of course formula_18 and thus the volume of the truncated acute hyperbolic solid alone is formula_19. If formula_20, as in the modern calculus derivation, formula_21.)

In the this is one of two proofs of the volume of the (truncated) acute hyperbolic solid.
The use of Cavalieri&#x27;s indivisibles in this proof was controversial at the time and the result shocking (Torricelli later recording that Gilles de Roberval had attempted to disprove it); so when the was published, the year after , Torricelli also supplied a second proof based upon orthodox Archimedean principles showing that the right cylinder (height formula_9 radius formula_10) was both upper and lower bound for the volume.
Ironically, this was an echo of Archimedes&#x27; own caution in supplying two proofs, mechanical and geometrical, in his &quot;Quadrature of the Parabola&quot; to Dositheus.

When the properties of Gabriel&#x27;s horn were discovered, the fact that the rotation of an infinitely large section of the  plane about the  axis generates an object of finite volume was considered a paradox. While the section lying in the  plane has an infinite area, any other section parallel to it has a finite area. Thus the volume, being calculated from the &quot;weighted sum&quot; of sections, is finite.

Another approach is to treat the solid as a stack of disks with diminishing radii. The sum of the radii produces a harmonic series that goes to infinity. However, the correct calculation is the sum of their squares. Every disk has a radius and an area or . The series diverges, but the series converges. In general, for any real , the series converges. (see Particular values of the Riemann zeta function for more detail on this result)

The apparent paradox formed part of a dispute over the nature of infinity involving many of the key thinkers of the time, including Thomas Hobbes, John Wallis, and Galileo Galilei.
There is a similar phenomenon that applies to lengths and areas in the plane. The area between the curves and from 1 to infinity is finite, but the lengths of the two curves are clearly infinite.

In lecture 16 of his 1666 , Isaac Barrow held that Torricelli&#x27;s theorem had constrained Aristotle&#x27;s general dictum (from &quot;De Caelo&quot; book 1, part 6) that &quot;there is no proportion between the finite and the infinite&quot;. Aristotle had himself, strictly speaking, been making a case for the impossibility of the physical existence of an infinite body rather than a case for its impossibility as a geometrical abstract.
Barrow had been adopting the contemporary 17th-century view that Aristotle&#x27;s dictum and other geometrical axioms were (as he had said in lecture 7) from &quot;some higher and universal science&quot;, underpinning both mathematics and physics.
Thus Torricelli&#x27;s demonstration of an object with a relation between a finite (volume) and an infinite (area) contradicted this dictum, at least in part.
Barrow&#x27;s explanation was that Aristotle&#x27;s dictum still held, but only in a more limited fashion when comparing things of the same type, length with length, area with area, volume with volume, and so forth.
It did not hold when comparing things of two different genera (area with volume, for example) and thus an infinite area &quot;could&quot; be connected to a finite volume.

Others used Torricelli&#x27;s theorem to bolster their own philosophical claims, unrelated to mathematics from a modern viewpoint.
Ignace-Gaston Pardies in 1671 used the acute hyperbolic solid to argue that finite humans could comprehend the infinite, and proceeded to offer it as proof of the existences of God and immaterial souls.
Since finite matter could not comprehend the infinite, Pardies argued, the fact that humans could comprehend this proof showed that humans must be more than matter, and have immaterial souls.
In contrast, Antoine Arnauld argued that because humans perceived a paradox here, human thought was limited in what it could comprehend, and thus is not up to the task of disproving divine, religious, truths.

Hobbes&#x27; and Wallis&#x27; dispute was actually within the realm of mathematics: Wallis enthusiastically embracing the new concepts of infinity and indivisibles, proceeding to make further conclusions based upon Torricelli&#x27;s work and to extend it to employ arithmetic rather than Torricelli&#x27;s geometric arguments; and Hobbes claiming that since mathematics is derived from real world perceptions of finite things, &quot;infinite&quot; in mathematics can only mean &quot;indefinite&quot;.
These led to strongly worded letters by each to the Royal Society and in &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, Hobbes resorting to namecalling Wallis &quot;mad&quot; at one point.
In 1672 Hobbes tried to re-cast Torricelli&#x27;s theorem as about a &quot;finite&quot; solid that was extended &quot;indefinitely&quot;, in an attempt to hold on to his contention that &quot;natural light&quot; (i.e. common sense) told us that an infinitely long thing must have an infinite volume.
This aligned with Hobbes&#x27; other assertions that the use of the idea of a zero-width line in geometry was erroneous, and that Cavalieri&#x27;s idea of indivisibles was ill-founded.
Wallis argued that there existed geometrical shapes with finite area/volume but no centre of gravity based upon Torricelli, stating that understanding this required more of a command of geometry and logic &quot;than M. Hobs is Master of&quot;.
He also restructured the arguments in arithmetical terms as the sums of arithmetic progressions, sequences of arithmetic infinitesimals rather than sequences of geometric indivisibles.

Oresme had already demonstrated that an infinitely long shape can have a finite area where, as one dimension tends towards infinitely large, another dimension tends towards infinitely small.
In Barrow&#x27;s own words &quot;the infinite diminution of one dimension compensates for the infinite increase of the other&quot;, in the case of the acute hyperbolic solid by the equation of the Apollonian hyperbola formula_24.

===Painter&#x27;s paradox===
Since the horn has finite volume but infinite surface area, there is an apparent paradox that the horn could be filled with a finite quantity of paint and yet that paint would not be sufficient to coat its surface.
However, this paradox is again only an apparent paradox caused by an incomplete definition of &quot;paint&quot;, or by using contradictory definitions of paint for the actions of filling and painting.

One could be postulating a &quot;mathematical&quot; paint that is infinitely divisible (or can be infinitely thinned, or simply zero-width like the zero-width geometric lines that Hobbes took issue with) and capable of travelling at infinite speed, or a &quot;physical&quot; paint with the properties of paint in the real world.
With either one, the apparent paradox vanishes:

With &quot;mathematical&quot; paint, it does not follow in the first place that an infinite surface area requires an infinite volume of paint, as infinite surface area times zero-thickness paint is indeterminate.

With physical paint, painting the outside of the solid would require an infinite amount of paint because physical paint has a non-zero thickness. Torricelli&#x27;s theorem does not talk about a layer of finite width on the &quot;outside&quot; of the solid, which in fact would have infinite volume. Thus there is no contradiction between infinite volume of paint and infinite surface area to cover. It is also impossible to paint the interior of the solid, the finite volume of Torricelli&#x27;s theorem, with physical paint, so no contradiction exists. This is because physical paint can only fill an &quot;approximation&quot; of the volume of the solid. The molecules do not completely tile 3-dimensional space and leave gaps, and there is a point where the &quot;throat&quot; of the solid becomes too narrow for paint molecules to flow down.

Physical paint travels at a bounded speed and would take an infinite amount of time to flow down. This also applies to &quot;mathematical&quot; paint of zero thickness if one does not additionally postulate it flowing at infinite speed.

Other different postulates of &quot;mathematical&quot; paint, such as infinite-speed paint that gets thinner at a fast enough rate, remove the paradox too. For volume formula_25 of paint, as the surface area to be covered tends towards infinity, the thickness of the paint formula_26 tends towards zero. Like with the solid itself, the infinite increase of the surface area to be painted in one dimension is compensated by the infinite decrease in another dimension, the thickness of the paint.

==Converse==

The converse of Torricelli&#x27;s acute hyperbolic solid is a surface of revolution that has a &quot;finite&quot; surface area but an &quot;infinite&quot; volume.

In response to Torricelli&#x27;s theorem, after learning of it from Marin Mersenne, Christiaan Huygens and René-François de Sluse wrote letters to each other about extending the theorem to other infinitely long solids of revolution; which have been mistakenly identified as finding such a converse.

Jan A. van Maanen, professor of mathematics at the University of Utrecht, reported in the 1990s that he once mis-stated in a conference at Kristiansand that de Sluse wrote to Huygens in 1658 that he had found such a shape:

to be told in response (by Tony Gardiner and Man-Keung Siu of the University of Hong Kong) that any surface of rotation with a finite surface area would of necessity have a finite volume.

Professor van Maanen realized that this was a misinterpretation of de Sluse&#x27;s letter, and that what de Sluse was &quot;actually&quot; reporting that the solid &quot;goblet&quot; shape, formed by rotating the cissoid of Diocles and its asymptote about the &quot;y&quot; axis, had a finite volume (and hence &quot;small weight&quot;) and enclosed a cavity of infinite volume.

Huygens first showed that the area of the rotated two-dimensional shape (between the cissoid and its asymptote) was finite, calculating its area to be 3 times the area of the generating circle of the cissoid, and de Sluse applied Pappus&#x27;s centroid theorem to show that the solid of revolution thus has finite volume, being a product of that finite area and the finite orbit of rotation.
The area &quot;being rotated&quot; is finite; de Sluse did not actually say anything about the surface area of the resultant rotated volume.

Such a converse essentially cannot occur:
:Let be a connected subset of formula_27. Let be a continuously differentiable real-valued function over . If the solid of revolution generated by revolving about the -axis has finite surface area , it also has finite volume.

<doc id="332260" wikidata="Q280522" url="?curid=332260" title="Śvetāmbara">
<text>The Śvetāmbara (; also spelled Shwetambara, Shvetambara, Svetambara or Swetambara) is one of the two main branches of Jainism, the other being the Digambara. &quot;Śvetāmbara&quot; in Sanskrit means &quot;white-clad&quot;, and refers to its ascetics&#x27; practice of wearing white clothes, which sets it apart from the &quot;Digambara&quot; or &quot;sky-clad&quot; Jains whose ascetic practitioners go nude. Śvetāmbaras do not believe that ascetics must practice nudity.

The Śvetāmbara and Digambara traditions have had historical differences ranging from their dress code, their temples and iconography, attitude towards Jain nuns, their legends and the texts they consider as important. Śvetāmbara Jain communities are currently found mainly in Gujarat, Rajasthan and coastal regions of Maharashtra. According to Jeffery D. Long, a scholar of Hindu and Jain studies, about four-fifths of all Jains in India are Śvetāmbaras.

== History and lineage ==

Śvetāmbaras consider themselves to be the original followers of Mahavira and that the Digambara sect emerged in 82 AD as a result of a rebellion by a monk named Sivabhuti, who was the disciple of Arya Krishnasuri. This account is found in 5th century Śvetāmbara text &quot;Viśeśāvaśyaka Bhaśya&quot; written by Jinabhadra. This is also the earliest formal recognition of the schism between the two sects. 

Śvetāmbaras have several p&quot;attavalis&quot; that mention the historical lineage of their chief monks (a&quot;charya&quot;) beginning with the 24th Tirthankara Mahavira. The most popular of the &quot;pattavalis&quot; is the one mentioned in the Kalpa Sūtra, a canonical scripture of the Śvetāmbaras. According to the lineage mentioned in the Kalpa Sūtra, Sthulabhadra was, unequivocally, the successor of Bhadrabāhu. Śvetāmbaras also believe that both of them were white-clad monks. These beliefs are completely rejected by the Digambara sect. 

To manage the large following of the &quot;murtipujaka&quot; sect, &quot;Gacchas&quot; (administrative sub-divisions) were created. Each &quot;gaccha&quot; has its own &quot;pattavali.&quot; One of the 84 &quot;gacchas&quot; was the Upkeśa Gaccha. While all other &quot;pattavalis&quot; (including the one mentioned in the Kalpa Sūtra) trace their lineage to the 24th Tirthankara Mahavira, &quot;Upkesa Gaccha&quot;″s &quot;pattavali&quot; traces its lineage to the 23rd Tirthankara Parshvanatha. Kesiswami, one of Parshvanatha&#x27;s chief disciples, Acharya Ratnaprabhasuri, the founder of the Oswal community as well as Acharya Swayamprabhasuri, the founder of the Porwal community belonged to this &quot;gaccha&quot;. It was in existence until 1930s when it went extinct. 

Majority of the Śvetāmbaras are &quot;murtipujakas&quot;, that is they actively offer devotional &quot;puja&quot; in temples, worship before the images or idols of Tirthankaras and important Jain demi-gods and demi-goddesses. Historically, this is the oldest sub-tradition of the Śvetāmbaras and all other aniconic sects have emerged in and after the 14th century. 

The Śvetāmbara &quot;murtipujaka&quot; (idol-worshipping) sect is the largest of all sects and sub-sects of Jainism and has the most number of followers as well as monks. To manage the large following, &quot;gacchas&quot; (administrative sub-divisions) were created. 84 &quot;gacchas&quot; have come into existence till date and most of them are extinct now. Only 4 survive today - &quot;Tapa Gaccha&quot;, &quot;Kharatara Gaccha&quot;, &quot;Parshvachandra Gaccha&quot;, and &quot;Achal Gaccha.&quot; Of these, Tapa Gaccha is the largest, with the most monks and followers.

The &quot;murtipujaka&quot; sect has had various eminent monks, including, but not limited to Vimalsuri, Hemachandra, Hiravijaya, Devardhigani Kshamashraman, Yashovijaya, Anandghan, Siddhasena, and Manatunga.

==Scriptures and literature==

Śvetāmbara literature can be classified into two major categories canonical and non-canonical. Canonical scriptures state the Jain cosmology and the Jain philosophy as well as the foundational aspects of understanding Jainism. They also govern the conduct of monks, nuns, as well as the laity. Non-canonical scriptures include, but are not limited to commentaries on canonical scriptures, biographies of the Śalākāpuruṣas (as in Hemachandra&#x27;s &quot;Trisasti-shalakapurusa-caritra&quot;), Jain mythology, treatise and extensions of the canonical scriptures, lists of rare and uncommon words and knowledge base and dictionaries for Ardhamagadhi Prakrit, Maharashtri Prakrit, and Sanskrit, devotional hymns (&quot;stavan, stuti, sajjhay,&quot; or &quot;mantra&quot;), and miscellaneous scriptures. 

=== &quot;Āgamas&quot; or Canonical Literature ===
The Śvetāmbara canon consists of 45 scriptures, mostly written in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit. They are considered to be what is left of Mahavira&#x27;s teachings. Historically, the knowledge of these scriptures was passed down orally in a preceptor-disciple system (&quot;guru-shishya parampara&quot;). However, the memory of the monks weakened in the 12-year long famine as described in the Kalpa Sūtra. As a result, most of the knowledge of the canonical scriptures was lost. The remaining canon was codified at the Great Council of Vallabhi under leadership of Devardhigani Kshamashramana, which was held at Vallabhi in 454 CE resulting in the 45 scriptures that govern the Śvetāmbara sect&#x27;s religious practices till date. 

From a linguistic point of view, Śvetāmbara canonical scriptures are the oldest of all Jain literature. The Ācārāṅga Sūtra, Uttaradhyayana Sutra, and the Sthananga Sutra of the Śvetāmbara canon are considered to have been created in 5th-4th century BC. Following is a list of the 45 canonical scriptures followed by the Śvetāmbaras: -

The above list makes it 46, but the last a&quot;ngā Driśtivāda&quot; is considered to be lost by both the sects. It was this scripture that contained the 14 &quot;purvas&quot; (14 scriptures containing extensive knowledge) of Jainism.

=== Non-Canonical Literature ===
All texts or pieces of literature written by Śvetāmbara monks, except the ones stated above are considered to be non-canonical in nature. Following are some popular examples. However, the complete list is inexhaustive as the Śvetāmbara sect has always had more monks than the Digambara sect: -

== Religious practices ==

=== The &quot;Chaturvidha Sangha&quot; ===
There are vast differences between the practices of the Śvetāmbaras and the Digambaras with some fundamental overlaps. Śvetāmbara scriptures divide the &quot;Jain Sangha&quot; into four parts and the congregation is popularly known as the &quot;chaturvidha sangha&quot; (a &quot;sangha&quot; comprising four parts). The four parts are monks, nuns, male lay followers (also known as &quot;śrāvakas&quot;), and female lay followers (also known as &quot;śrāvikās&quot;). Religious practices of the Śvetāmbara sect differ for each section (monastics and laity) of the &quot;sangha&quot;. 

=== Monasticism ===

==== Preparing for Initiation ====
Right before initiation, an ascetic-to-be performs his/her final &quot;puja&quot; of the Tirthankara idols. Monks and nuns are not permitted to perform &quot;puja&quot; of the idols because they are not permitted to bath all their life and Śvetāmbara scriptures only permit a person with clean body and after bathing may perform &quot;puja&quot; of the idols. Ceremonious donation of all world possessions is performed before initiation. 

==== Initiation ====
Upon initiation, a monk or a nun renounces all worldly possessions and relations, takes the Five Vows and tears his/her hair out. A newly-initiated monk/nun is ceremoniously given the &quot;rajoharan&quot; by their preceptor (who is always only an &quot;acharya&quot;). Unlike as in the Digambara sect where monks and nuns are not forbidden from touching each other and lay-followers of the opposite gender, monks and nuns of the Śvetāmbara sect do not touch persons of the opposite gender (neither mendicants nor lay-followers of the opposite gender) and observe extreme celibacy all their life. 

==== Monastic Possessions (&quot;Āvaśyakas&quot;) ====
Monks and nuns of the Śvetāmbara sect wear white seamless clothing and carry a &quot;rajoharan&quot; (woolen broom to clear their path of insects and small creatures), an alms bowl, a long stick, and scriptures. All monks and nuns possess only these objects. Additionally, they may only take what is given to them and what comes under permitted possessions (the objects listed earlier). They are not permitted to take anything that is not given to them by the owner of the said object. 

==== Begging for Alms ====
Unlike ascetics of the Digambara sect, ascetics of the Śvetāmbara sect beg for alms from multiple households as the Ācārāṅga Sūtra describes how begging for alms for an entire meal from a single household does not fall under fault-free food that Jain monks must consume as it might aggrieve the householder they accept food from. Becoming the medium for a householder&#x27;s grievance is unacceptable as per a mendicant&#x27;s conduct. 42 faults of food are described which a monk or a nun must assess before accepting it as alms. They may only consume food free from the 42 faults (as described in the Ācārāṅga Sūtra) and boiled water between the period from 48 minutes after sunrise and until 48 minutes before sunset. However, monks and nuns of the Śvetāmbara sect actively perform and promote and inspire the laity to perform fasting to obtain control over the senses. 

==== Wandering ====
Mendicants constantly wander for 8 months of a year (except the 4 months of the &quot;chaturmasya&quot;) on foot. The reason mendicants must wander is to regulate their senses of possession and to spread the word of Jainism. The Ācārāṅga Sūtra describes that for a mendicant, staying at one place for a period extending more than 1 month is not permitted. The reason for that is to regulate possession. A mendicant staying at one place for longer periods of time might begin getting attached to the place and such attachments must be avoided and if developed, given up. However, during the 4 months of the &quot;chaturmasya&quot;, rains are expected and there is an increase in the number of insects on ground. Mendicants must not step on insects to practice &quot;ahimsa&quot; and therefore, they are required to stay at one place for those 4 months. Stepping on grass and on water or wet ground is not permitted due to their tendency to have life. Most mendicants give religious sermons and spread the word of Jainism wherever they wander. Usually, nowadays, several Jain temples have spaces that are used for general purposes that mendicants may use after obtaining permission from the temple management. This is particularly important as if the space was constructed for the purpose of housing mendicants, even temporarily, it becomes unfit for use by mendicants. That is because it no longer remains &#x27;free of faults&#x27; since mendicants become a medium of violence as well as possession here. This is discussed in the Ācārāṅga Sūtra at length.

==== Classes of Monks ====
Monks of the Śvetāmbara sect are categorized among the classes as described in the Namokar Mantra. Each newly initiated monk is a &quot;sadhu&quot; (the fifth class as described in the fifth line of the Namokar Mantra). After attaining sufficient spiritual and scriptural knowledge along with experience of the monastic life, a &quot;sadhu&quot; may be promoted to the status of an &quot;upadhyaya&quot; (the fourth class as described in the fourth line of the Namokar Mantra). Finally, after sufficient spiritual education, a monk is promoted to the status of an &quot;acharya&quot;.

&quot;Acharyas&quot; are spiritual heads of the said monastic order. Usually each of the 4 g&quot;acchas&quot; has a spiritual preceptor of the highest order and who is referred to as the &quot;gacchadhipati&quot; of the said &quot;gaccha&quot;. A &quot;gacchadhipati&quot; is an &quot;acharya&quot;. Each of &quot;Kharata Gaccha&quot;, &quot;Achal Gaccha&quot;, and &quot;Parshvachandra Gaccha&quot; have one &quot;gacchadhipati&quot; each. However, &quot;Tapa Gaccha&quot; has 21 &quot;gacchadhipatis&quot; as it is further sub-divided into various &quot;samudaays&quot; (smaller sections of a &quot;gaccha&quot;). Some of the major &quot;samudaays&quot; of the &quot;Tapa Gaccha&quot; are - &quot;Buddhisagarsuri Samudaay&quot;, &quot;Sagaranand (or Anandsagar) Samudaay, Kalapurnasuri Samudaay, Bhuvanbhanusuri Samudaay&quot; etc. Another class of monks is &quot;ganivarya&quot; who are spiritual heads of a small sub-section of monks in a &quot;samudaay&quot;. Other classes of monks such as &quot;panyaas&quot; and &quot;upapanyaas&quot; also exist.

==== Other Duties ====
Śvetāmbara monks also perform other miscellaneous functions and duties. Some of them are as described below: -

* Writing non-canonical scriptures (including commentaries on canonical scriptures) such as Hemachandra&#x27;s &quot;Yogaśāstra,&quot; Haribhadra&#x27;s &quot;Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya,&quot; Yashovijaya&#x27;s &quot;Gyānsār&quot; Jinabhadra&#x27;s &quot;Viśeśāvaśyaka Bhaśya.&quot;
* Writing devotional songs (&quot;stavans&quot;, &quot;stutis&quot;, &quot;sajjhays&quot; etc.), such as Anandghan&#x27;s &quot;Chouvisi,&quot; Manatunga&#x27;s &quot;Bhaktāmara Stotra,&quot; Siddhasena&#x27;s &quot;Kalyan Mandir Stotra&quot; and &quot;Vardhamān Śakrastav Stotra,&quot; Hemachandra&#x27;s &quot;Sakalarhat Stotra&quot; etc.
* Actively promoting principles of Jainism among the laity through religious sermons.
* Administering vows to the laity, such as the laity&#x27;s 12 vows.
* Accepting confessions from and giving tasks to make up for their sins to the laity (&quot;alochana&quot; or &quot;prāyaścitta&quot;).
* &quot;Acharyas&quot; perform consecration of temple lands and idols in a ritual known as &quot;anjana-śalākā.&quot;
* Training the lay followers who seek initiation in the near future.
* Regularly performing Pratikramana.

=== Laity ===
The Śvetāmbara canon defines some guidelines and duties for lay followers (&quot;śrāvakas&quot; and &quot;śrāvikās&quot;) of Jainism to fulfill. Some of them are summarized as follows: -

==== 12 &quot;Vrats&quot; (Vows) of Householders ====
Scriptures describe 12 vows that a householder must take in order to bind minimum &quot;karma&quot;. These 12 vows are also taken by lay followers of the Digambara sect as well as the aniconic offshoots of the Śvetāmbara sect. They are one of the very few points that both the sects agree upon. They summarize almost all duties a householder must perform as part of the Jain &quot;sangha&quot;. They are classified into 3 categories. Following is a list of the 12 vows of a householder: -

* 5 &quot;Aṇuvratas&quot; 
*# &quot;Sthūla Prāṇātipāta Viramaṇ Vrat&quot;: A toned-down version of the &quot;Ahimsa&quot; M&quot;ahāvrat&quot; followed by the mendicants. Minimal and unavoidable violence is acceptable on householders&#x27; part and they are not required to follow &quot;ahimsa&quot; (non-violence) as mendicants follow.
*# &quot;Sthūla Mṛṣāvāda Viramaṇ Vrat&quot;: This is a toned-down version of the &quot;Satya Mahāvrat&quot; followed by the mendicants. Householders are directed to avoid speaking lies.
*# &quot;Sthūla Adattādāna Viramaṇ Vrat&quot;: This is a milder form of the &quot;Achaurya Mahāvrat&quot; followed by monks and nuns. Householders are discouraged from stealing anything that is not theirs or is not given to them.
*# &quot;Sthūla Maithuna Viramaṇ Vrat&quot;: This is a toned-down form of the &quot;Brahmacharya Mahāvrat&quot; taken by the mendicants. Householders are discouraged from engaging in adultery with anyone other than their partner for any purpose.
*# &quot;Sthūla Parigrah Viramaṇ Vrat&quot;: This is a milder form of the mendicants&#x27; &quot;Aparigrah Mahāvrat&quot;. Householders are discouraged from holding assets more than their requirement and needs. Being too deeply involved in worldly and materialistic pleasures is a hindrance to the attainment of &quot;moksha&quot;.
*3 &quot;Guṇavratas&quot; 
*#&quot;Sthūla Dik Parimāṇa Vrat&quot;: This vow is taken to reduce the movement in each direction by setting a specific limit. This is done to ensure minimum traveling is performed, leading to lesser &quot;karma&quot; being bound to the soul. 
*#&quot;Sthūla Bhogopabhoga Viramaṇ Vrat&quot;: This vow is taken to reduce the usage of materialistic objects to a set limit. By taking this vow, a lay follower can reduce their attachment to materialistic objects.
*#&quot;Sthūla Anarthadaṇḍa Viramaṇ Vrat&quot;: This vow is taken to completely give up useless and fruitless activities. Any action which is performed without a reason constitutes to a sin. Therefore, this vow directs a lay-follower to reduce/stop performing useless actions and activities.
*4 &quot;Śikṣāvratas&quot; 
*#&quot;Sāmāyika Vrat&quot;: This vow can either be given by a mendicant, or a lay-person who has already taken the vow or, can be self-taken. It lasts 48 minutes and lay followers are encouraged to study scriptures and improve their knowledge of the religion in this time. For these 48 minutes, a lay follower becomes just like a mendicant and must follow the Five Vows just like they do. One who takes this vow detaches themself from the worldly activities and embraces equanimity for 48 minutes at once. In loose terms, equanimity (indifference to the positives and negatives around one) is the ultimate goal of Jainism as it leads to no &quot;karma&quot; being bound to the soul.
*#&quot;Deśāvakāśika Vrat&quot;: This vow entails the completion of 2 &quot;pratikramanas&quot; and 8 &quot;sāmāyikas&quot;.
*#&quot;Pauṣadha Vrat&quot;: This vow is taken for a specific period of time and is given by a mendicant only. During this time, the lay follower becomes equivalent to a mendicant and must practice the Five Vows just like they do. The follower must also beg for alms and follow all rule, rites, and rituals a mendicant follows.
*#&quot;Atithi Saṃvibhāga Vrat&quot;: This vow promotes charity among the lay followers in that they are encouraged to donate their belongings to monks, nuns, and other needy people. It is believed that this vow, if taken and followed seriously, leads to a reduction in attachment to the worldly and materialistic pleasures.

==== 6 &quot;Āvaśyakas&quot; (Essential Observances) of Householders ====
6 essential observances have been considered necessary for a lay follower to practice regularly in both the sects. However, the observances are different in each sect. Mendicants also observe these regularly and it is believed that these essential observances help one maintain discipline as well as bind least and shed most &quot;karma&quot;. Following are the 6 essential observances of &quot;śrāvakas&quot; and &quot;śrāvikās&quot; of the Śvetāmbara sect: -

# &quot;Sāmāyika&quot;: This concept is considered to be so important that it occurs in the 12 vows as well as 6 essential observances. It has also been a subject of great discussion in the canonical scripture Uttaradhyayana Sutra. A lay follower embraces equanimity for 48 minutes and that is how purification of soul happens.
# &quot;Chaturvimsati-stava&quot;: This refers to extolling and appreciating the qualities of and praying to &quot;tirthankaras&quot; as supreme beings for purification of soul. Through this, a lay follower attains the &quot;ratnatraya&quot; and eventual &quot;samyaktva&quot; (true and right knowledge, belief, and conduct). Śvetāmbara canon defines the &quot;Logassa Sutra&quot; and &quot;Namutthunam Sutra&quot; to extol the qualities of the 24 &quot;tirthankaras&quot;. It is written in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit.
# &quot;Vandanā&quot;: This refers to the practice of showing obeisance towards one&#x27;s preceptor mendicant (monk/nun). It also means one should surrender themself to their guru and accept their word as it is. Performing service of one&#x27;s preceptor and respecting them is one of the prime duties of householders.
# &quot;Pratikramana&quot;: Shedding of negative &quot;karma&quot; is the prime goal of Jainism and this practice directly lets one perform that. It entails performing penance and mindfully regretting and seeking forgiveness for one&#x27;s wrong deeds. It consists of a long sequence of hymns, prayers, and rituals. The main goal is to seek forgiveness for one&#x27;s negative actions. It includes the first, second, and the fifth &quot;Āvaśyakas&quot; as part of rituals within it.
# &quot;Kāyotsarga&quot;: This practice is concerned with concentration on non-attachment. This may be performed in a standing or a sitting posture and during this time, the lay follower must not think of any attachments, including the body. As per the canonical scripture &quot;Sthananga Sutra&quot;, a lay follower goes into &quot;shukladhyan&quot; (pure meditation) during &quot;kayotsarga&quot;. Usually &quot;Chaturvimsati-stava Āvaśyaka&quot; through &quot;Logassa Sutra&quot; is performed during &quot;kayotsarga&quot;.
# &quot;Pratyākhyāna&quot;: Last of all &quot;Āvaśyakas,&quot; it includes taking vows for and limiting all actions so as to perform minimal &quot;karma&quot;. A lay follower takes &quot;pratyākhyāna&quot; (vow) before commencing fasts. Similarly, a lay follower takes &quot;pratyākhyāna&quot; to limit intake of food and ay other materialistic things to have a better self-control. According to the 24th tirthankara Mahavira in the &quot;Uttaradhyayana Sutra&quot;, a follower&#x27;s soul is purified by taking &quot;pratyākhyāna&quot; and renouncing certain actions and objects for a set period of time.

==== &quot;Jinpūjā&quot; and &quot;Caityavandan&quot; (Idol Worship) ====
The Śvetāmbara canon unequivocally endorses the worshipping of idols of &quot;tirthankaras&quot; by all sections of the &quot;Chaturvidha Sangha&quot;. The main motive behind such worshipping is not a worldly affair, but worshipping their qualities. Most Śvetāmbara lay-followers perform worshipping of idols in three main formats: -

* &quot;Aṅga Pūjā&quot; (Worshipping by anointing various parts of the idol): Such worshipping is performed by anointing various parts of the idol using several objects of worship, including water, saffron mixed with sandalwood paste, &quot;Vāsakṣepa&quot; (sandalwood powder), &quot;Yakṣakardama&quot; (a fragrant ointment) etc. According to scriptures, such worshipping is performed only using &quot;&#x27;uttam dravya&quot;″ (excellent and possibly expensive objects of worship).Mendicants are not allowed to perform worshipping using such objects as they do not own materialistic objects and have already renounced them. Also the violence that can be caused towards small creatures and beings during such worshipping is unacceptable according to a mendicant&#x27;s conduct as described in the scriptures. Householders are not supposed to follow such micro levels of non-violence and must perform idol worship as it has more merits (extolling qualities of &quot;tirthankaras&quot; and eventually attaining such a state) than demerits as described in the canon. Another form of such worship is &quot;Aṅga Rachanā&quot; or &quot;Āṅgī&quot;, which refers to the devotional worshipping of the idol by decorating it with a devotedly designed armor of vibrant objects such as stones, clothes, and other colorful objects that are obtained by pure methods and sources. 
* &quot;Agra Pūjā&quot; (Worshipping of the idol without touching it): Such worshipping is performed by placing objects of worship in front of the idol and reciting Prakrit or Sanskrit prayers, or singing devotional hymns. Objects of worship include, &quot;Dhūp&quot; (incense), &quot;Dīpa&quot; (lamp), &quot;Akṣata&quot; (raw rice grains), &quot;Fal&quot; (fruits), and &quot;Naivedya&quot; (sweets). Each object of worshipping has its own significance and reason. These 5, in combination with &quot;Jal Pūjā&quot; (bathing the idol with water), &quot;Kesar Pūjā&quot; (worshipping with idol by anointing it with a mixture of sandalwood paste and saffron), and &quot;Kusum Pūjā&quot; (worshipping the idol by placing flower on its parts) are collectively known as &quot;Aṣṭaprakāri Pūjā&quot;. Mendicants cannot perform this form of worshipping as well as the material used for such worshipping can cause violence against small creatures and a mendicant must strictly follow the Five Vows of which non-violence is the first. However, householders may perform such worshipping as the vows they follow do not entail practicing such micro-level of non-violence. 
* &quot;Bhāva Pūjā&quot; (worshipping of the idol through emotions without using objects of worship): This form of worshipping includes singing &quot;stavans&quot; and &quot;stutis&quot; (devotional hymns) extolling the life and qualities of a &quot;tirthankara&quot;. A sequence of several Prakrit and some Sanskrit prayers extolling a &quot;tirthankara&quot; in particular seating positions is known as &quot;Caityavandan&quot;. &quot;Caityavandan&quot; is usually performed in two postures &quot;Yogamudrā&quot; and &quot;Muktāśuktimudrā&quot;. It also includes 2 &quot;kayotsargas&quot; and at least 3 hymns and a recitation of major Jain hymns and prayers including Namokar Mantra, Uvasaggaharam Stotra, and &quot;Logassa Sutra&quot;. It is considered to be a standard form of &quot;Bhāva Pūjā&quot; amongst the Śvetāmbara laity. Digambaras strictly do not have such form of worshipping of their idols. &quot;Bhāva Pūjā&quot; does not include the use of any materialistic objects of worship and therefore, can be performed by the mendicants. In fact, devotional hymns are usually authored by the Śvetāmbara mendicants which is why the Śvetāmbara sect has huge and rich literature on devotional worship of the &quot;tirthankaras&quot;.
Several other forms of worshipping of the idols exist. One of the most popular ones is &quot;Snātra Pūjā&quot; which is a lengthy ritual that includes mimicking of a &quot;tirthankara&#x27;s&quot; ritualistic bathing at Mount Meru by the demi-god Indra. Other popular ritualistic bathing is &quot;Śakrastava Abhiṣeka&quot; which is performed parallel to the recitation of the hymn of the same name authored by Acharya Siddhasenadiwakarsuri. Usually, regular purification of temples and icons is performed and the ritual for which include &quot;18 Abhiṣeka&quot; which is a ritualistic bathing of the idols with 18 excellent objects of high fragrance and devotional value.

==== &quot;Vyākhyāna&quot; and &quot;Guruvandan&quot; (Interaction with Mendicants) ====
The &quot;Chaturvidha Sangha&quot; has 4 pillars and &quot;śrāvakas&quot; and &quot;śrāvikās&quot; (lay followers) derive their knowledge of the religion and its practices from the other two pillars - mendicants (monks and nuns). &quot;Vyākhyāna&quot; refers to the religious sermons that the mendicants give. It is a result of these sermons that Jainism is propagated to the lay followers. Since reading scriptures without the preceptor&#x27;s permission is considered to be a grave sin, lay followers (householders) derive all their knowledge of the religion and scriptures as well as their duties and responsibilities from the mendicants&#x27; v&quot;yākhyānas&quot;. As such, even though attending &quot;vyākhyānas&quot; is not an essential part as per scriptures, lay followers are always encouraged to attend them regularly to learn principles of Jainism. A formal procedure of greeting the preceptor by reciting 2 ancient Prakrit prayers - &quot;Icchakāra Sutra&quot; and &quot;Abbhuthio Sutra&quot; and 4 &quot;Khamāsamaṉas&quot; in a particular sequence is known as &quot;Guruvandan&quot;. The practice of &quot;Guruvandan&quot; is only performed by householders of the Śvetāmbara sect.

== Religious festivals ==
There are some festivals which are exclusively celebrated by the Śvetāmbara sect and are neither recognized nor celebrated by the Digambara sect. Following is a list of some of those festivals: -

=== &quot;Paryuṣaṇa&quot; ===
It is one of the most popular of the Jain festivals. It falls during the bright fortnight of the &quot;Bhadrapada&quot; month of the lunar calendar. During this 8-day long festival, lay followers intensify their spirituality and undertake rigorous fasting. Some of them also fast for all 8 days by consuming either only boiled water or nothing at all (this fast is known as &quot;atthai&quot;). It is during these 8 days that monks and nuns read the holy canonical scripture - Kalpa Sūtra. Most of the reading is done in private, except the chapter that describes the birth of Mahavira, which is traditionally read and celebrated publicly on the 5th of the 8 days. The 8th day is known as &quot;samvatsari&quot; and is considered to be one of the holiest days by Śvetāmbara lay followers, who perform &quot;pratikramana&quot; and seek forgiveness for the sins they committed in the past year by saying &quot;&quot;Michchhāmi Dukkaḍaṃ&quot;&quot; to the people they know. Digambaras, alternatively, celebrate the &quot;Das Lakshana,&quot; which is a 10-day long festival and has a different purpose than &quot;Paryuṣaṇa.&quot;

=== &quot;Śāśvata Navpad Oli&quot; ===
This is a 9-day long festival that occurs twice a year, once in the &quot;Chaitra&quot; month and once in the &quot;Ashvin&quot; month of the lunar calendar. This is one of the two major celebrations as per Śvetāmbara scriptures, the other being &quot;Paryuṣaṇa&quot;. During this festival, Śvetāmbaras worship the 9 supreme entities, namely &quot;Arihant&quot;, &quot;Siddhā&quot;, &quot;Ācārya&quot;, &quot;Upādhyāya&quot;, &quot;Sādhu&quot;, &quot;Samyak Darśana&quot;, &quot;Samyak Jñāna&quot;, &quot;Samyak Cāritra&quot;, and &quot;Samyak Tap&quot;, one day for each of these entities. Jainism believes that these 9 entities were neither created nor can they be destroyed. It believes in the eternal existence of these &#x27;categories&#x27; or &quot;padas&quot; that propagate &quot;dharma&quot;. Śvetāmbaras, therefore, consider this festival to be &quot;śāśvata&quot; (which means that it has existed since eternity and will continue to exist forever).

Throughout these 9 days, Śvetāmbara lay followers perform &quot;Ayambil&quot;, a form of fasting in which no oil, dairy products, and spices are consumed. This form of fasting is believed to improve control over the sense of taste. They also worship the &quot;Siddhachakra&quot; during these 9 days. Spiritual practices are intensified during these days just as during the &quot;Paryuṣaṇa&quot;. One of the most popular legends associated with this festival is of &quot;Śrīpāla&quot; and &quot;Mayaṇasundarī&quot;. Mahavir Janma Kalyanak falls on the 7th day of the &quot;Navpad Oli&quot; that occurs during the &quot;Chaitra&quot; month. Although Digambaras believe in the legend of &quot;Śrīpāla&quot; and &quot;Mayaṇasundarī&quot;, they do not perform &quot;Ayambil&quot; and their practices are vastly different from the Śvetāmbaras.

=== &quot;Jñāna Pañcamī&quot; ===
It is celebrated on the 5th day of the bright fortnight of the &quot;Kārtika&quot; month of the lunar calendar. This festival is celebrated to worship &quot;Samyak&quot; &quot;Jñāna&quot; (right knowledge). Rituals include visiting a Jain temple, placing objects of knowledge (such as pen, pencil, paper, books etc.) on a platform and venerating the object with &quot;Vāsakṣepa&quot; (sandalwood powder) and reciting hymns venerating the demi-goddess Saraswati. In Jainism, the eternal knowledge of the road to &quot;moksha&quot; is recorded in the word of the &quot;tirthankaras&quot; and that is known as &quot;jinvāṇī.&quot; This is what Saraswati represents. Therefore, in Jainism, she is not worshipped as she is in Hinduism, but as the word of the tirthankaras. Jainism endorses the existence of 5 types of knowledge &quot;Mati Jñāna&quot;, &quot;Śrut Jñāna&quot;, &quot;Avadhi Jñāna&quot;, &quot;Manaḥparyaya Jñāna&quot;, &quot;Kevala Jñāna&quot;. All these forms of knowledge are highly venerated and worshipped in the Śvetāmbara sect. Lay followers of the Śvetāmbara sect also perform penance and fast to celebrate the day. Most followers, if they do not perform fasts, refrain from consuming food after sunset.

=== &quot;Maun Ekādaśī&quot; ===
This festival is celebrated on the 11th day of the bright fortnight of the &quot;Maargashirsha&quot; month of the lunar calendar. Śvetāmbara legends say that if a devotee performs penance staying mum on this day every year for a period of 11 years and 11 months achieves &quot;moksha&quot;. The word &quot;&#x27;maun&quot;″ means silence. The most prominent of the penances on this day is to not speak and communicate for the entire day, until the next morning. This form of penance is believed to improve control over the mind and the tongue. According to Śvetāmbara legends, a total of 150 &quot;kalyāṇakas&quot; of the &quot;panch kalyanakas&quot; of tirthankaras of the past, present, and future half cycles of time occur on this single day. Therefore, it holds high importance and auspiciousness in the Śvetāmbara sect. Most lay followers begin new ventures and worship tirthankara idols especially apart from performing the penance of staying silent on this day. Several legends including that of Neminatha and Krishna and of &quot;Suvrat Shetha&quot; are associated with this day.

=== &quot;Phālguṇa Pherī&quot; ===
This festival is observed on the 13th day of the bright fortnight of the &quot;Phalguna&quot; month as per the lunar calendar and is directly associated with Palitana, one of the most important pilgrimage sites for the Śvetāmbaras. Śvetāmbara legends state that Krishna&#x27;s sons Pradyumna and Shyaambh, along with 8.5 crore (85 million) mendicants attained liberation from &quot;Bhadva&#x27;s Dungar&quot; at Palitana hills on this day. Śvetāmbara lay followers visit Palitana temples in huge numbers on this day, every year and circumambulate the entire region of Palitana hills in a single day. The walk is 15-18km long along a hilly terrain. This walk is also known as the &quot;6-Gau Yaatra&quot; (walk of visiting 6 villages).

Devotees first ascend the hill until they reach the &quot;Ram Pol&quot; gate, and then take a different route from the usual route, which is opened only on this day every year for devotees to circumambulate around the hill. This route takes devotees through various &#x27;hidden&#x27; regions of the Palitana temples, which are otherwise inaccessible on other days. The shrines that this walk takes a devotee through can be summarized as follows: -

# The shrine of Devaki&#x27;s 6 sons According to the Jain version of Mahabharata, Devaki gave birth to 6 other sons before giving birth to Krishna. These 6 sons were initiated into the Jain sangha by Neminatha. Legend says that all 6 of them attained liberation at the spot where this shrine stands today.
# &quot;Ulkā Jal Deri &quot; It is believed to be the site where the water which is used in ritualistic bathing of the idol of Rishabhanatha gets collected.
# &quot;Chandan Talavdi&quot; Legend says this lake was established by &quot;Chillan Muni&quot;, a disciple of &quot;Ganadhar Pundarik Swami&quot;, who was himself one of the prime disciples of Rishabhanatha. It is said that he used his magical powers and established the lake for devotees to quench their thirst while ascending the hill. The lake&#x27;s banks are of importance as Śvetāmbaras believe several mendicants performed penance in the &quot;kayotsarga&quot; posture at this point and eventually attained liberation. Several devotees perform &quot;kayotsarga&quot; here and recite the &quot;Logassa&quot; hymn.
# &quot;Ajitnath - Shantinath Deri &quot; These are two shrines devoted to the 2nd Tirthankara Ajitanatha and 16th Tirthankara Shantinatha each. Shrines dedicated to these two tirthankaras were constructed because it is believed that these two gave religious sermons in the said area. Legend says that during the 22nd tirthankara Neminatha&#x27;s period, these two shrines stood opposite to each other and when a devotee would pray at one of these, their back would face the other. However, facing one&#x27;s back towards tirthankara idols is considered to be a sin. Nandisena, a mendicant at that time, sat in the middle of both these shrines and composed the &quot;Ajit-Śānti Stava&quot;, a hymn in which alternate verse extol Ajitanatha and Shantinatha. The legend says that by the end of his recitation of the composition, the two shrines came side by side to each other. Today, both shrines stand next to each other.
# &quot;Siddhshila &quot; According to legends, this spot has witnessed most number of souls attaining &quot;moksha&quot; than any other spot on Palitana hills.
# &quot;Bhadva&#x27;s Dungar &quot; This is believed to be the spot where Krishna&#x27;s sons Pradyumna and Shyaambh attained &quot;moksha&quot; along with 8.5 crore (85 million) other mendicants. This place is believed to be the inspiration behind the whole walk of around 15-18km (12 miles).
# &quot;Siddha Vad &quot; This is an old Banyan tree. It is believed that several soul attained &quot;moksha&quot; while performing penance under this tree.
# &quot;Juni Taleti &quot; This shrine is the old starting point of the ascent of the main hill. This is the point where the &quot;Phālguṇa Pherī&quot; comes to an end.

=== &quot;Dhvajā Mahotsava&quot; ===
It is a generic name given to various observances and celebrations at different Jain temples. It refers to the changing of the flag that is hoisted at the top of a Jain temple&#x27;s &quot;śikhara&quot; (topmost part of the structure) and is celebrated annually at every Jain temple. A common ritual is followed wherein the devotees bid to get a chance of changing the flag. The highest bidder performs devotional &quot;puja&quot; according to a ritual described in the scriptures and changes the &quot;dhvaj&quot; (flag) hoisted on the &quot;śikhara&quot; every year throughout lifetime passed on generation after generation. Every Jain temple has a different day for the ceremony and it is celebrated on the said temple&#x27;s anniversary. A &quot;svāmi-vātsalya&quot; (community lunch) is organized as part of the ceremony. 

=== &quot;Akshaya Tritiya&quot; ===

In Jainism, Akshaya Tritiya is an important festival as it commemorates the first Tirthankara, Rishabhanatha, ending his 400-day-long fast by consuming sugarcane juice poured into his cupped hands. Śvetāmbara Jains perform a similar fast (but consume food on alternate days) that lasts 400 days. This practice is popularly known as &quot;Varshitapa&quot;. Rishabhanatha renounced worldly pleasures and turned into a monk. Thereafter, he fasted for 400 days. He did not accept food from lay followers as every time he was given food, it was not &#x27;free of faults&#x27; as it should be for a Jain monk to accept. The 42 faults that food given to a Jain monk may have are discussed at length in the ancient Śvetāmbara text Ācārāṅga Sūtra. 

== &quot;Sthanakvasi&quot; and &quot;Terapanthi&quot; (Aniconic) Traditions ==
A minority of the Śvetāmbaras are split into other traditions where either Jain temples and halls are built but &quot;puja&quot; is a minor practice, or where all construction and use of temples, images and idols is actively discouraged and avoided. These sub-traditions began around 14th-century through 18th-century and are not considered authentic by any of the major Śvetāmbara monks and scriptures. 

A layman who opposed devotional temples, images and idols was Lonka Shah (c. 1476 CE) who is responsible for starting the Sthānakavāsī sub-tradition. Bhikshu was initiated as a Sthānakavāsī monk, but he believed that their teachings were inappropriate. As a result, he started the Terapanth sub-tradition after criticizing the Sthanakvasi sub-tradition&#x27;s beliefs. Early colonial era observers and some early 20th-century Jain writers such as Malvaniya hypothesized that this movement against idol worship may be the impact of Islam on Jainism, but later scholarship states that the sub-traditions arose from an internal dispute and debate on the principle Ahimsa (non-violence). The newer sub-traditions only accept 32 of the 45 scriptures of the original Śvetāmbara canon. In the 32 they have accepted, several parts have been modified and major sections of their canon is different from the original canon as followed by the oldest sect of the &quot;murtipujakas&quot;. 

These sub-traditions are not recognized by the original Śvetāmbara sect of the idol-worshippers (&quot;murtipujakas&quot;), who consider that they were created as a result of a grave misinterpretation of canonical scriptures. The &quot;murtipujaka&quot; Śvetāmbaras do not allow laypersons to read scriptures as a misinterpretation of the canon is considered to be a grave sin. The later sub-traditions have made their canon openly accessible. Both the newer sub-traditions have various sub-traditions within them that do not agree on several aspects of the canon due to an open access to their canon and eventual misinterpretation. 

==Differences with Digambaras==
Other than rejecting or accepting different ancient Jain texts, Digambaras and Śvetāmbara differ in other significant ways such as:

Śvetāmbaras believe that Parshvanatha, the 23rd tirthankara, taught only Four restraints (a claim, scholars say is confirmed by the ancient Buddhist texts that discuss Jain monastic life). Mahāvīra taught Five vows. The Digambara sect disagrees with the Śvetāmbara interpretations, and reject the theory of difference in Parshvanatha and Mahāvīra&#x27;s teachings. However, Digambaras as well as Śvetāmbaras follow Five vows as taught by Mahavira. The difference is only that Śvetāmbaras believe Parshvanatha taught one vow less (the Four vows except Brahmacharya) than Mahavira. However, monks of Śvetāmbara sect also follow all 5 vows as stated in the Ācārāṅga Sūtra.
* Digambaras believe that both Parshvanatha and Mahāvīra remained unmarried, whereas Śvetāmbara believe the 23rd and 24th tirthankar did indeed marry. According to the Śvetāmbara version, Parshvanāth married Prabhavati, and Mahāvīraswāmi married Yashoda who bore him a daughter named Priyadarshana. The two sects also differ on the origin of Trishala, Mahāvīra&#x27;s mother, as well as the details of Tirthankara&#x27;s biographies such as how many auspicious dreams their mothers had when they were in the wombs.Digambaras believe it is 16 dreams while Śvetāmbaras believe it is 14.
* Śvetāmbaras have a more comprehensive set of scriptures as they have a canon with extensive information, supported by the non-canonical literature. Digambara literature is much lesser in volume and their scriptures are more recent than those of the Śvetāmbaras.
* Śvetāmbara believe that the Jain canon is still preserved, whereas Digambaras believe it was lost about 200 years after Mahāvīra&#x27;s nirvana. Śvetāmbaras also have a richer non-canonical literature.
* Digambara believe Rishabha, Vasupujya and Neminatha were the three &quot;tirthankaras&quot; who reached omniscience while in sitting posture and other tirthankaras were in standing ascetic posture. In contrast, Śvetāmbaras believe it was Rishabha, Nemi and Mahāvīra who were the three in sitting posture.
* According to Śvetāmbara Jain texts, since Rishabhanatha&#x27;s time, till date, its monastic community has had more &quot;sadhvis&quot; than &quot;sadhus&quot; (female than male mendicants). In &quot;Tapa Gacch&quot; of the modern era, the ratio of &quot;sadhvis&quot; to &quot;sadhus&quot; (nuns to monks) is about 3.5 to 1. In contrast to Śvetāmbara, the Digambara sect monastic community has been predominantly male.
* In the Digambara tradition, a male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve his soul&#x27;s liberation from rebirths through asceticism. Women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation in the Digambara sect of Jainism. The Śvetāmbaras strictly disagree with the Digambaras, believing that women can also achieve liberation from &quot;saṃsāra&quot; through ascetic practices.
* The Śvetāmbaras state the 19th Tirthankara Māllīnātha was female. However, Digambara reject this, and worship Mallinatha as a male.

<text>In computability theory, a set of natural numbers is called computable, recursive, or decidable if there is an algorithm which takes a number as input, terminates after a finite amount of time (possibly depending on the given number) and correctly decides whether the number belongs to the set or not.

A set which is not computable is called noncomputable or undecidable.

A more general class of sets than the computable ones consists of the computably enumerable (c.e.) sets, also called semidecidable sets. For these sets, it is only required that there is an algorithm that correctly decides when a number &quot;is&quot; in the set; the algorithm may give no answer (but not the wrong answer) for numbers not in the set.

==Formal definition==

A subset formula_1 of the natural numbers is called computable if there exists a total computable function formula_2 such that formula_3 if formula_4 and formula_5 if formula_6. In other words, the set formula_1 is computable if and only if the indicator function formula_8 is computable.

==Examples and non-examples==
Examples:
*Every finite or cofinite subset of the natural numbers is computable. This includes these special cases:
**The empty set is computable.
**The entire set of natural numbers is computable.
**Each natural number (as defined in standard set theory) is computable; that is, the set of natural numbers less than a given natural number is computable.
*The subset of prime numbers is computable.
*A recursive language is a computable subset of a formal language.
*The set of Gödel numbers of arithmetic proofs described in Kurt Gödel&#x27;s paper &quot;On formally undecidable propositions of Principia Mathematica and related systems I&quot; is computable; see Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems.

Non-examples:

*The set of Turing machines that halt is not computable.
*The isomorphism class of two finite simplicial complexes is not computable.
*The set of busy beaver champions is not computable.
*Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem is not computable.

==Properties==

If &quot;A&quot; is a computable set then the complement of &quot;A&quot; is a computable set. If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are computable sets then &quot;A&quot; ∩ &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot; ∪ &quot;B&quot; and the image of &quot;A&quot; × &quot;B&quot; under the Cantor pairing function are computable sets.

&quot;A&quot; is a computable set if and only if &quot;A&quot; and the complement of &quot;A&quot; are both computably enumerable (c.e.). The preimage of a computable set under a total computable function is a computable set. The image of a computable set under a total computable bijection is computable. (In general, the image of a computable set under a computable function is c.e., but possibly not computable).

&quot;A&quot; is a computable set if and only if it is at level formula_9 of the arithmetical hierarchy.

&quot;A&quot; is a computable set if and only if it is either the range of a nondecreasing total computable function, or the empty set. The image of a computable set under a nondecreasing total computable function is computable.

<doc id="332272" wikidata="Q4418716" url="?curid=332272" title="Siddhanta">
<text> (Devanagari: ) is a Sanskrit term denoting the established and accepted view of any particular school within Indian philosophy; literally &quot;settled opinion or doctrine, dogma, axiom, received or admitted truth; any fixed or established or canonical text-book on any subject&quot; (from &quot;siddha&quot;, adj. mfn.- accomplished, fulfilled; that has attained the highest object, thoroughly skilled or versed in).

==Hindu philosophy==
This term is an established term within Hindu philosophy which denotes a specific line of development within a Hindu religious or philosophical tradition. The traditional schools of Hindu philosophy have had their &quot;siddhāntas&quot; established by their respective founders in the form of &quot;sūtras&quot; (aphorisms). The &quot;sūtras&quot; are commented by a major philosopher in the respective traditions to elaborate upon the established doctrine by quoting from the &quot;śāstras&quot; (scriptures) and using logic and pramāṇas (accepted source of knowledge). For example, in the tradition of Vedanta, the author of the Brahma Sūtra was Veda-Vyāsa and the commentators were Ādi Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja and Mādhavācārya (each of whom eventually set up sub-schools within Vedānta). Also, in the tradition of &quot;Pūrva Mīmāṁsā&quot;, the author of the &quot;sūtra&quot; was Jaimini and the commentator was Śabarasvāmi.

==Buddhist philosophy==
&quot;Siddhānta&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;grub mtha&quot;&#x27;) is a genre of Buddhist literature, which is quite common in Tibetan Buddhism. This genre has its antecedents in Pali suttas such as the &quot;Tevijja sutta&quot; and the &quot;Brahmajala sutta.&quot; These early Buddhist sources discuss the various worldviews of brahmins, sramanas and ascetics during the Buddha&#x27;s time. Buddhist scholastic literature later expanded the discussion to numerous other Buddhist and non-Buddhist views. Indian works which discuss various competing doctrines include the &quot;Kathavatthu&quot;, the &quot;Mahavibhasa&quot;, Bhaviveka&#x27;s &quot;Blaze of Reasoning&quot; and Shantaraksita&#x27;s &quot;Tattvasamgraha&quot;.

Tibetan Buddhists developed the genre further and numerous &quot;siddhānta&quot; works were written by figures such as Rongzompa, Chekawa Yeshe Dorje, Sakya Pandita, Longchenpa, Jamyang Shéba, and Changkya Rölpé Dorjé. According to Daniel Cozort, Jamyang&#x27;s massive &quot;Great Exposition of Tenets&quot; &quot;are the most comprehensive of the tenets texts&quot; (in Tibetan Buddhism). During the 18th century, Thuken Losang Chökyi Nyima (1737–1802), a student of Changkya, wrote &quot;Crystal Mirror of Philosophical Systems.&quot; According to Roger R. Jackson, this text is &quot;arguably the widest-ranging account of religious philosophies ever written in pre-modern Tibet.&quot; This work discusses all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism and Chinese religions as well as Indian, Mongolian and Khotanese religious systems.

==Jain philosophical studies==
For Jainism, the texts vary between the three primary sects, with Sthanakavasis believing in no textual authority. Both the Digambara and Śvetāmbara believe that the &quot;purest&quot; Jain teachings were contained within the &quot;Purvas&quot;, which have been mostly lost to antiquity. Of the surviving Jain scriptures, the Digambara tend to focus upon the Prakaranas; while the Śvetāmbara focus upon the Angas.

==Astronomy==

In Indian astronomy and astrology, Siddhanta (or Siddhantic) refers to a genre of texts that replaced the earlier tradition based on the &quot;Vedanga Jyotisha&quot;. The Siddhanta (&quot;established theory&quot;) genre emerged around the beginning of the first millennium CE. Compared to the &quot;Vedanga Jyotisha&quot;, the Siddhanta texts discussed a wider range of topics including the nakshatras, the zodiac signs, precise calculations of the solar year, computations of planetary motions and positions, calculation of solar and lunar eclipses, and parallax.

Early Indian astronomy is transmitted in &quot;Siddhanta&quot;s: Varahamihira (6th century) in his &quot;Pancha-Siddhantika&quot; contrasts five of these: The Surya Siddhanta besides the Paitamaha Siddhantas (which is more similar to the &quot;classical&quot; &quot;Vedanga Jyotisha&quot;), the Paulisha and Romaka Siddhantas (directly based on Hellenistic astronomy) and the Vasishtha Siddhanta.

<text>Elaine Brown (born March 2, 1943) is an American prison activist, writer, singer, and former Black Panther Party chairwoman who is based in Oakland, California. Brown briefly ran for the Green Party presidential nomination in 2008.

She is currently serving as the COO of Oakland &amp; the World Enterprises, which she founded in 2014.

==Early life==

Elaine Brown grew up in the inner city of North Philadelphia with her mother Dorothy Clark and an absent father. Despite being in desperate poverty, Brown&#x27;s mother worked hard to provide for Elaine. She was enrolled in private schooling, took music lessons, and had nice clothing. During her childhood, she studied classical piano and ballet for many years at a predominantly white experimental elementary school. As a young Black woman, Elaine had very few African-American friends and spent most of her time with white people. After graduating from Philadelphia High School for Girls, a public preparatory school for gifted young women, she studied at Temple University for less than a semester. She withdrew from Temple because of her desire to work in the music industry. Brown moved to Los Angeles, California, to become a professional songwriter.
While in Los Angeles, Brown enrolled in the University of California Los Angeles. She later went on to briefly attend Mills College and Southwestern University School of Law.

Upon arriving in California with little money and few contacts, Brown got work as a cocktail waitress at the strip club The Pink Pussycat. While working at the Pink Pussycat, she met Jay Richard Kennedy, a music executive who taught her about the intricacies of social justice. They became lovers. Brown learnt about political radicalisation first hand while in a relationship with Kennedy. Because of the thorough education on the Civil Rights Movement, Capitalism, and Communism which Kennedy provided to her, Brown later became involved with the Black Liberation Movement. After living together for a brief time in the Hollywood Hills Hotel, the pair parted ways. After this pivotal relationship, Brown&#x27;s involvement in politics grew and she began working for the radical newspaper &quot;Harambee&quot;. Soon after, Brown became the first representative of the Black Student Alliance at the Black Congress in California. In April 1968, after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., she attended her first meeting of the Los Angeles chapter of the Black Panther Party.

== Involvement with the Black Panther Party ==

In 1968, Brown joined the Black Panther Party as a rank-and-file member, studying revolutionary literature, and selling Black Panther Party newspapers. She soon helped the party set up its first Free Breakfast for Children program in Los Angeles, as well as the Party&#x27;s initial Free Busing to Prisons Program and Free Legal Aid Program.

In 1968, Brown was commissioned by David Hilliard, the Party chief of staff, to record her songs, a request resulting in the album &quot;Seize the Time&quot;. She eventually assumed the role of editor of &quot;the&quot; &quot;Black Panther&quot; publication in the Southern California Branch of the Party.

Brown was part of a U.S. People&#x27;s Anti-Imperialist Delegation which visited China in 1970, along with fellow prominent party member Eldridge Cleaver.

In 1971, Brown became a member of the Party&#x27;s Central Committee as Minister of Information, replacing the expelled Cleaver. In 1973, Brown was commissioned to record more songs by Black Panther Party founder and Minister of Defense Huey P. Newton. These songs resulted in the album &quot;Until We&#x27;re Free&quot;.

As part of a directive by Newton, Brown unsuccessfully ran for the Oakland city council in 1973, getting 30 percent of the vote. She ran again in 1975, losing again with 44 percent of the vote. When Newton fled to Cuba in 1974 to avoid criminal charges, he appointed Brown to lead the Black Panther Party. Brown was the only woman to do so. She chaired the Black Panther Party from 1974 until 1977. She dealt with regular sexism because the men were angered by the thought of taking orders from a woman.

During Brown&#x27;s leadership of the Black Panther Party, she focused on electoral politics and community service. In 1977, she managed Lionel Wilson’s victorious campaign to become Oakland’s first black mayor. Also, Brown founded the Panther&#x27;s Liberation School, which was recognized by the state of California as a model school.

Brown stepped down from chairing the Black Panther Party less than a year after Newton’s return from Cuba in 1977, when Newton refused to condemn the beating of Regina Davis, an administrator of the Panther Liberation School. Other male members of the party beat Davis and broke her jaw because she reprimanded a coworker when he did not do an assignment. Newton opted for solidarity with the men. This incident was the point at which Brown could no longer tolerate the sexism and patriarchy of the Black Panther Party. For many, Brown&#x27;s leaving was seen as a turning point for the Party. She left Oakland with her daughter, Ericka, and moved to Los Angeles - fearing for her personal safety. 

Brown recorded two albums, &quot;Seize the Time&quot; (Vault, 1969) and &quot;Until We&#x27;re Free&quot; (Motown Records, 1973). &quot;Seize the Time&quot; includes &quot;The Meeting,&quot; the anthem of the Black Panther Party.

==Later activism==

After leaving the Black Panther Party, also in order to raise her daughter Ericka, Brown worked on her memoir, &quot;A Taste of Power&quot;. She eventually returned to the struggle for black liberation, especially espousing the need for radical prison reform. From 1980 to 1983, she attended Southwestern University School of Law in Los Angeles.
From 1990 to 1996, she lived in France. In 1996, Brown moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and founded Fields of Flowers, Inc., a non-profit organization committed to providing educational opportunities for impoverished African-American children. In 1998, she co-founded the grassroots group Mothers Advocating Juvenile Justice to advocate for children being prosecuted as adults in the state of Georgia. Around the same time, she continued her advocacy for incarcerated youth by founding and leading the Michael Lewis Legal Defense Committee. Michael Lewis, also known as “Little B”, was sentenced to life in prison at the age of 14 for a murder that Brown believes he did not commit. Brown would eventually write a non-fiction novel, &quot;The Condemnation of Little B&quot;, which analyzes the prosecution of Lewis as part of the greater problem of the increased imprisonment of black youth.

In 2003, Brown co-founded the National Alliance for Radical Prison Reform, which helps thousands of prisoners find housing after they are released on parole, facilitates transportation for family visits to prisons, helps prisoners find employment, and raises money for prisoner phone calls and gifts. 
In 2005, while protesting a G-8 Summit in Sea Island, Georgia, Brown learned of the massive poverty in the nearby city of Brunswick, Georgia. Brown then attempted to run for mayor of Brunswick against Bryan Thompson. Running on the Green Party ticket, Brown hoped to become mayor in order to use her influence to bring the Michael Lewis case to prominence, as well as to empower blacks in Brunswick by using her elected office to create a base of economic power for the city&#x27;s majority black and poor population through redistribution of the city&#x27;s revenues. Though Brown was eventually disqualified from running and voting in Brunswick because she failed to establish residency in the city, her efforts brought widespread attention to Michael Lewis&#x27;s case. She later became a co-founder of the Brunswick Women&#x27;s Association for a People&#x27;s Blueprint.

Brown has continued her prison reform advocacy by lecturing frequently at colleges and universities in the US. Since 1995, she has lectured at more than forty colleges and universities, as well as numerous conferences.

==2007 Green Party role ==
In March 2007, Brown announced her bid to be the 2008 Green Party presidential nominee. Brown felt that a campaign was necessary to promote the interests of those not represented by the major political parties, especially the interests of women under 30 and African Americans. Her platform focused on the needs of working-class families, promoting living wages for all, free health care, more funding for public education, more affordable housing, removal of troops from Iraq, improving the environment, and promoting equality. Brown intended on using her campaign to bring many minorities to the Green Party in the hope that it would better represent a revolutionary force for social justice. In late 2007, she resigned from the Green Party, as she found that the Party remained dominated by whites who had “no intention of using the ballot to actualize real social progress, and will aggressively repel attempts to do so.”

In 2010, inmates in more than seven Georgia prisons used contraband cellphones to organize a nonviolent strike for better prison conditions, Brown became their &quot;closest adviser outside prison walls.&quot; She &quot;helped distill the inmate complaints into a list of demands. She held a conference call... to develop a strategy with various groups, including the Georgia chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Nation of Islam.&quot;

== Personal life ==

Brown has one daughter, Ericka Abram, fathered by Black Panther member Raymond Hewitt, but Hewitt was mostly absent from his daughter&#x27;s life. At Hewitt&#x27;s funeral, Elaine Brown was in attendance.

<doc id="332277" wikidata="Q2714574" url="?curid=332277" title="Milton Avery">
<text>Milton Clark Avery (; March 7, 1885 – January 3, 1965) was an American modern painter. Born in Altmar, New York, he moved to Connecticut in 1898 and later to New York City. He was the husband of artist Sally Michel Avery and the father of artist March Avery.

==Early life==
The son of a tanner, Avery began working at a local factory at the age of 16 and supported himself for decades with a succession of blue-collar jobs. The death of his brother-in-law in 1915 left Avery, as the sole remaining adult male in his household, responsible for the support of nine female relatives. His interest in art led him to attend classes at the Connecticut League of Art Students in Hartford, and over a period of years, he painted in obscurity while receiving a conservative art education. In 1917, he began working night jobs in order to paint in the daytime.

In 1924, he met Sally Michel, a young art student, and in 1926, they married. Her income as an illustrator enabled him to devote himself more fully to painting. Beginning in the 1930s, the two began developing a &quot;lyrical, collaborative style&quot; that Robert Hobbs described as &quot;the Avery style&quot;.

They had a daughter, March Avery, in 1932.

==Career==
For several years in the late 1920s through the late 1930s, Avery practiced painting and drawing at the Art Students League of New York. Roy Neuberger saw his work and thought he deserved recognition. Determined to get the world to know and respect Avery&#x27;s work, Neuberger bought over 100 of his paintings, starting with &quot;Gaspé Landscape&quot;, and lent or donated them to museums all over the world. With Avery&#x27;s work rotating through high-profile museums, he came to be a highly respected and successful painter.

In the 1930s, he was befriended by Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko among many other artists living in New York City in the 1930s–40s. Avery&#x27;s use of glowing color and simplified forms was an influence on the younger artists.

The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., was the first museum to purchase one of Avery&#x27;s paintings in 1929; that museum also gave him his first solo museum exhibition in 1944. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963.

Avery had a serious heart attack in 1949. During his convalescence he concentrated on printmaking. When he resumed painting, his work showed a new subtlety in the handling of paint, and a tendency toward slightly more muted tones.

==Death==
Milton Avery died at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, New York, on January 3, 1965, following a long illness, and is buried in the Artist&#x27;s Cemetery in Woodstock, Ulster County, New York.  After his passing his widow, Sally Avery, donated his personal papers to the Archives of American Art, a research center of the Smithsonian Institution.

==Style and influence==
Avery&#x27;s work is seminal to American abstract painting—while his work is clearly representational, it focuses on color relations and is not concerned with creating the illusion of depth as most conventional Western painting since the Renaissance has. Avery was often thought of as an American &quot;Matisse&quot;, especially because of his colorful and innovative landscape paintings. His poetic, bold and creative use of drawing and color set him apart from more conventional painting of his era. Early in his career, his work was considered too radical for being too abstract; when Abstract Expressionism became dominant his work was overlooked, as being too representational.

French Fauvism and German Expressionism influenced the style of Avery&#x27;s early work, and his paintings from the 1930s are similar to those of Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. By the 1940s, Avery&#x27;s painting style had become more similar to Henri Matisse, and his later works use color with great subtlety. According to art historian Barbara Haskell, &quot;serenity and harmony&quot; characterized all of Avery&#x27;s work, especially his late work, which, &quot;more than ever, exuded a world of low-key emotions from which anger and anxiety were absent.&quot; In her 1981 book on Avery, art historian Bonnie Grad proposed that the contemplative, lyrical quality of Avery&#x27;s work should be seen in light of the tradition of the pastoral mode in art and literature.

==About Avery&#x27;s art==
According to painter Mark Rothko, What was Avery&#x27;s repertoire? His living room, Central Park, his wife Sally, his daughter March, the beaches and mountains where they summered; cows, fish heads, the flight of birds; his friends and whatever world strayed through his studio: a domestic, unheroic cast. But from these there have been fashioned great canvases, that far from the casual and transitory implications of the subjects, have always a gripping lyricism, and often achieve the permanence and monumentality of Egypt.

Art critic Hilton Kramer said, in his review of Grad&#x27;s book with its sumptuous illustrations,He was, without question, our greatest colorist. ... Among his European contemporaries, only Matisse—to whose art he owed much, of course—produced a greater achievement in this respect.

<text>Epaulette (; also spelled epaulet) is a type of ornamental shoulder piece or decoration used as insignia of rank by armed forces and other organizations. Flexible metal epaulettes (usually made from brass) are referred to as &quot;shoulder scales&quot;.

In the French and other armies, epaulettes are also worn by all ranks of elite or ceremonial units when on parade. It may bear rank or other insignia, and should not be confused with a shoulder mark – also called a shoulder board, rank slide, or slip-on – a flat cloth sleeve worn on the shoulder strap of a uniform (although the two terms are often used interchangeably).

==Etymology==
 () is a French word meaning &quot;little shoulder&quot; (diminutive of , meaning &quot;shoulder&quot;).

==How to wear==
Epaulettes are fastened to the shoulder by a shoulder strap or &quot;passenten&quot;,
a small strap parallel to the shoulder seam, and the button near the collar, or by laces on the underside of the epaulette passing through holes in the shoulder of the coat. Colloquially, any shoulder straps with marks are also called epaulettes. The placement of the epaulette, its color and the length and diameter of its bullion fringe are used to signify the wearer&#x27;s rank. At the join of the fringe and the shoulderpiece is often a metal piece in the form of a crescent. Although originally worn in the field, epaulettes are now normally limited to dress or ceremonial military uniforms.

== History ==
Epaulettes bear some resemblance to the shoulder pteruges of ancient Greco-Roman military costumes. However, their direct origin lies in the bunches of ribbons worn on the shoulders of military coats at the end of the 17th century, which were partially decorative and partially intended to prevent shoulder belts from slipping. These ribbons were tied into a knot that left the fringed end free. This established the basic design of the epaulette as it evolved through the 18th and 19th centuries.

From the 18th century on, epaulettes were used in the French and other armies to indicate rank. The rank of an officer could be determined by whether an epaulette was worn on the left shoulder, the right shoulder, or on both. Later a &quot;counter-epaulette&quot; (with no fringe) was worn on the opposite shoulder of those who wore only a single epaulette. Epaulettes were made in silver or gold for officers and in cloth of various colors for the enlisted men of various arms.

Apart from that, flexible metal epaulettes were quite popular among certain armies in the 19th century, but were rarely worn on the field. Referred to as shoulder scales, they were e.g. an accoutrement of the US Cavalry, US Infantry and the US Artillery, from 1854 to 1872.

By the early 18th century, epaulettes had become the distinguishing feature of commissioned rank. This led officers of military units still without epaulettes to petition for the right to wear epaulettes to ensure that their status would be recognized. 
During the Napoleonic Wars and subsequently through the 19th century, grenadiers, light infantry, voltigeurs and other specialist categories of infantry in many European armies wore cloth epaulettes with wool fringes in various colors to distinguish them from ordinary line infantry. Flying artillery wore epaulette-esque shoulder pads. Heavy artillery wore small balls representing ammunition on their shoulders.

An intermediate form in some services, such as the Russian Army, is the shoulder board, which neither has a fringe nor extends beyond the shoulder seam. This originated during the 19th century as a simplified version for service wear of the heavy and conspicuous full dress epaulette with bullion fringes.

==Modern derivations==
Today, epaulettes have mostly been replaced by a five-sided flap of cloth called a shoulder board, which is sewn into the shoulder seam and the end buttoned like an epaulette.

From the shoulder board was developed the shoulder mark, a flat cloth tube that is worn over the shoulder strap and carries embroidered or pinned-on rank insignia. The advantages of this are the ability to easily change the insignia as occasions warrant.

Airline pilot uniform shirts generally include cloth flattened tubular epaulettes having cloth or bullion braid stripes, attached by shoulder straps integral to the shirts. The rank of the wearer is designated by the number of stripes: traditionally four for a captain, three for senior first officer or first officer, and two for either a first officer or second officer. However, rank insignia are airline specific. For example, at some airlines, two stripes denote junior first officer and one stripe second officer (cruise or relief pilot). Airline captains&#x27; uniform caps usually will have a braid pattern on the bill. These uniform specifications change depending on the company&#x27;s policy.

Military-inspired civilian clothing became popular in the first decade of the 2000s, including epaulettes on shirts.

== Belgium ==
In the Belgian army, red epaulettes with white fringes are worn with the ceremonial uniforms of the Royal Escort while fully red ones are worn by the Grenadiers. Trumpeters of the Royal Escort are distinguished by all red epaulettes while officers of the two units wear silver or gold respectively.

== Canada ==
In the Canadian Armed Forces, epaulettes are still worn on some Army Full Dress, Patrol Dress, and Mess Dress uniforms. Epaulettes in the form of shoulder boards are worn with the officer&#x27;s white Naval Service Dress.

After the unification of the Forces, and prior to the issue of the distinctive environmental uniforms, musicians of the Music Branch wore epaulettes of braided gold cord.

== France ==
Until 1914, officers of most French Army infantry regiments wore gold epaulettes in full dress, while those of mounted units wore silver. No insignia was worn on the epaulette itself, though the bullion fringe falling from the crescent differed according to rank. Other ranks of most branches of the infantry, as well as cuirassiers wore detachable epaulettes of various colours (red for line infantry, green for Chasseurs, yellow for Colonial Infantry etc.) with woollen fringes, of a traditional pattern that dated back to the 18th century. Other cavalry such as hussars, dragoons and chasseurs à cheval wore special epaulettes of a style originally intended to deflect sword blows from the shoulder.
In the modern French Army, epaulettes are still worn by those units retaining 19th-century-style full dress uniforms, notably the ESM Saint-Cyr and the Garde Républicaine. The French Foreign Legion continued to wear their green and red epaulettes, except for a break from 1915 to 1930. In recent years, the Marine Infantry and some other units have readopted their traditional fringed epaulettes in various colours for ceremonial parades. The Marine nationale and the Armée de l&#x27;Air do not use epaulettes, but non-commissioned and commissioned officers wear a gilded shoulder strap called &quot;attentes&quot;, the original function of which was to clip the epaulette onto the shoulder. The &quot;attentes&quot; are also worn by Army generals on their dress uniforms.


== Germany ==

Until World War I, officers of the Imperial German Army generally wore silver epaulettes as a distinguishing feature of their full-dress uniforms. For ranks up to and including captain these were &quot;scale&quot; epaulettes without fringes, for majors and colonels with fine fringes and for generals with a heavy fringe. The base of the epaulette was of regimental colors. For ordinary duty, dress &quot;shoulder-cords&quot; of silver braid intertwined with state colors, were worn.

During the period 1919–1945, German Army uniforms were known for a four cord braided &quot;figure-of-eight&quot; decoration which acted as a shoulder board for senior and general officers. This was called a &quot;shoulder knot&quot; and was in silver with the specialty color piping (for field officers) and silver with red border (for generals). Although it was once seen on US Army uniforms, it remains only in the mess uniform. A similar form of shoulder knot was worn by officers of the British Army in full dress until 1914 and is retained by the Household Cavalry today. Epaulettes of this pattern are used by the Republic of Korea Army&#x27;s general officers and were widely worn by officers of the armies of Venezuela, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Ecuador and Bolivia; all of which formerly wore uniforms closely following the Imperial German model. The Chilean Army still retains the German style of epaulette in the uniforms of its ceremonial units, the Military Academy and the NCO School while the 5th Cavalry Regiment &quot;Aca Caraya&quot; of the Paraguayan Army sports both epaulettes and shoulder knots in its dress uniforms (save for a platoon wearing Chaco War uniforms). Epaulettes of the German pattern (as well as shoulder knots) are used by officers of ceremonial units and schools of the Bolivian Army.

==Haiti==
Gold epaulettes in Haiti, were frequently worn throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in full dress. During the Haitian Revolution, Gen. Charles Leclerc of the French Army wrote a letter to Napoleon Bonaparte saying, &quot;We must destroy half of those in the plains and must not leave a single colored person in the colony who has worn an epaulette.”

==Ottoman Empire==
During the Tanzimat period in the Ottoman Empire, western style uniforms and court dresses were adopted. Gold epaulettes were worn in full dress.

== Russian Empire ==
Both the Imperial Russian Army and the Imperial Russian Navy sported different forms of epaulettes for its officers and senior NCOs. Today the current Kremlin Regiment continues the epaulette tradition.

== Sweden ==
Epaulettes first appeared on Swedish uniforms in the second half of the 18th century. The epaulette was officially incorporated into Swedish uniform regulations in 1792, although foreign recruited regiments had had them earlier. Senior officers were to wear golden crowns to distinguish their rank from lower ranking officers who wore golden stars.

Epaulettes were discontinued on the field uniform in the mid-19th century, switching to rank insignia on the collar of the uniform jacket. Epaulettes were discontinued when they were removed from the general issue dress uniform in the 1930s. They are, however, still worn by the Royal Lifeguards and by military bands when in ceremonial full dress.

== United Kingdom ==

Epaulettes first appeared on British uniforms in the second half of the 18th century. The epaulette was officially incorporated into Royal Navy uniform regulations in 1795, although some officers wore them before this date. Under this system, flag officers wore silver stars on their epaulettes to distinguish their ranks. A captain with at least three years seniority had two plain epaulettes, while a junior captain wore one on the right shoulder, and a commander one on the left.

In 1855, army officers&#x27; large, gold-fringed epaulettes were abolished and replaced by a simplified equivalent officially known as twisted shoulder-cords. These were generally worn with full dress uniforms. Naval officers retained the historic fringed epaulettes for full dress during this period. These were officially worn until 1960 when they were replaced with shoulder boards. Today, only the officers of the Yeomen of the Guard, the Military Knights of Windsor, the Elder Brethren of Trinity House and the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports retain fringed epaulettes.

British cavalry on active service in the Sudan (1898) and during the Boer War (1899–1902) sometimes wore epaulettes made of chainmail to protect against sword blows landing on the shoulder. The blue &quot;Number 1 dress&quot; uniforms of some British cavalry regiments and yeomanry units still retain this feature in ornamental silvered form.

With the introduction of khaki service dress in 1902, the British Army stopped wearing epaulettes in the field, switching to rank insignia embroidered on the cuffs of the uniform jacket. During World War I, this was found to make officers a target for snipers, so the insignia was frequently moved to the shoulder straps, where it was less conspicuous.

The current multi-terrain pattern (MTP) and the older combat uniform (DPM) have the insignia formerly used on shoulder straps displayed on a single strap worn vertically in the centre of the chest. Earlier DPM uniforms had shoulder straps on the shoulders, though only officers wore rank on rank slides which attached to these straps, other ranks wore rank on the upper right sleeve at this time though later on regimental titles were worn on the rank slides. This practice continued into later patterns where rank was worn on the chest, rank was also added.

In modern times, epaulettes are frequently worn by professionals within the ambulance service to signify clinical grade for easy identification. These are typically green in colour with gold writing and may contain one to three pips to signify higher managerial ranks.

== United States ==

Epaulettes were authorized for the United States Navy in the first official uniform regulations, &quot;Uniform of the Navy of the United States, 1797&quot;. Captains wore an epaulette on each shoulder, lieutenants wore only one, on the right shoulder. By 1802, lieutenants wore their epaulette on the left shoulder, with lieutenants in command of a vessel wearing them on the right shoulder; after the creation of the rank of master commandants, they wore their epaulettes on the right shoulder similar to lieutenants in command. By 1842, captains wore epaulettes on each shoulder with a star on the straps, master commandant were renamed commander in 1838 and wore the same epaulettes as captains except the straps were plain, and lieutenants wore a single epaulette similar to those of the commander, on the left shoulder. After 1852, captains, commanders, lieutenants, pursers, surgeons, passed assistant and assistant surgeons, masters in the line of promotion and chief engineers wore epaulettes.

Epaulettes were specified for all United States Army officers in 1832; infantry officers wore silver epaulettes, while those of the artillery and other branches wore gold epaulettes, following the French manner. The rank insignia was of a contrasting metal, silver on gold and vice versa.

In 1851, the epaulettes became universally gold. Both majors and second lieutenants had no specific insignia. A major would have been recognizable as he would have worn a senior field officer&#x27;s more elaborate epaulette fringes. The rank insignia was silver for senior officers and gold for the bars of captains and first lieutenants. The choice of silver eagles over gold ones is thought to be one of economy; there were more cavalry and artillery colonels than infantry, so replacing the numerically fewer gold ones was cheaper.

Shoulder straps were adopted to replace epaulettes for field duty in 1836.

Licensed officers of the U.S. Merchant Marine may wear shoulder marks and sleeve stripes appropriate to their rank and branch of service. Deck officers wear a foul anchor above the stripes on their shoulder marks, and engineering officers wear a three-bladed propeller. In the U.S. Merchant Marine, the correct wear of shoulder marks depicting the fouled anchor is with the un-fouled stock of the anchor forward on the wearer.

<text>The 38(t), originally known as the [[ČKD]] LT vz. 38, was a tank designed during the 1930s, which saw extensive service during World War II. Developed in Czechoslovakia by Českomoravská Kolben-Daněk (ČKD), the type was adopted by Nazi Germany following the annexation of Czechoslovakia. With the German Army and other Axis forces, the type saw service in the invasions of Poland, France and the USSR. Production ended in 1942, when its main armament was deemed inadequate. In all, over 1,400 Pz. 38(t)s were manufactured. The chassis of the Pz. 38(t) continued to be produced for the Marder III (1942–1944) with some of its components used in the later Jagdpanzer 38 (1944–1945) tank destroyer and its derivative vehicles.

The (t) stands for , the German word for Czech; the Czechoslovak military designation was LT vz. 38 (, Light Tank model 38). Manufacturer&#x27;s designations included TNH series, TNHPS, LTP and LTH. The special vehicle () designation for the tank in Germany was Sd. Kfz. 140.

== Description ==
The Panzer 38(t) was a conventional inter-war tank design, with riveted armour. The armour varied in thickness from 10 mm to 25 mm in most versions. Later models (Ausf. E on) increased this to 50 mm by bolting on an additional 25 mm armour plate to the front portion of the hull. The sides received an additional 15 mm increase of armour from Ausf. E production runs onward.

The two-man turret was centrally located, and housed the tank&#x27;s main armament, a 37 mm Skoda A7 gun with 90 rounds of ammunition. In addition, a 7.92 mm machine gun was in a ball mount to the right of the main gun. This machine gun could be trained on targets independently of the main gun, or coupled to the main gun for use as a conventional coaxial machine gun. 

The driver was in the front right of the hull, with the radio operator seated to the driver&#x27;s left. The radio operator manned the hull-mounted 7.92 mm machine gun in front in addition to operating the radio on his left. The driver could also fire the hull machine gun with a trigger fitted on the left tiller bar. A total of 2,550 rounds were carried for the bow and turret machine guns. 

In German service, a loader position was added to the turret by reducing the ammunition capacity by 18 rounds. All future Panzer 38(t) tanks were rebuilt according to this specification and those already in service were modified accordingly. The commander had to aim and fire the main gun in addition to his role as commander.
Minor adjustments, such as adjustable seats for the driver and firmer footing for the commander/gunner and loader, were also made. 

The engine was mounted in the rear of the hull and powered the tank through a transmission at the front of the hull with five forward gears and one reverse gear. The track ran under four rubber-tyred road wheels and back over a rear idler and two track return rollers. The wheels were mounted on a leaf-spring double-bogie mounted on two axles.

== Development ==
In 1935, the Czechoslovak tank manufacturer ČKD was looking for a replacement for the LT-35 tank they were jointly producing with Škoda Works. The LT-35 was complex and had shortcomings, and ČKD felt there would be orders both from the expanding Czechoslovak army and for export.

ČKD decided to use a leaf-spring suspension with four large wheels for their new tank with an export success under the name &quot;TNH&quot;. With small variations for each customer, 50 were exported to Iran (TNHP), 24 each to Peru (LTP) and Switzerland (LTH). Lithuania also ordered some (LTL). The British Royal Armoured Corps (RAC) had one trial model delivered on 23 March 1939 to Gunnery School at Lulworth. A report stated that &quot;the (bow) gunner could not sit back comfortably as the wireless set was in the way of his left shoulder&quot;. The report also stated that, due to the shudder while the vehicle was on the move, it was impossible to lay the gun. Even at the speed of , accuracy was poor. As a result, the British did not purchase the LT-35 and the trial model was returned.
In the fall of 1937, the Czechoslovak Armed Forces launched a contest for a new medium tank; Škoda, ČKD and Tatra competed. Škoda Praga submitted the existing joint production export model mentioned above. ČKD also entered a prototype separate from the above, the interesting V-8-H (later called the ST vz. 39), which proved to have numerous mechanical problems. Tatra, known mostly for its smaller, wheeled armoured cars, submitted a paper entry that was a very novel concept that completely changed the layout of a tank, which concept they patented in 1938. On 1 July 1938, Czechoslovakia ordered 150 of the TNHPS model, although none had entered service by the time of the German occupation (March 1939).

=== German production ===
After the takeover of Czechoslovakia, Germany ordered continued production of the model as it was considered an excellent tank, especially compared to the Panzer I and Panzer II that were the &#x27;s main tanks at the outset of World War II. It was first introduced into German service under the name LTM 38; this was changed on 16 January 1940 to 38(t).

The relatively small turret of the Panzer 38(t) could not accommodate a cannon powerful enough to defeat more heavily armoured tanks such as the T-34, so production of the Pz. 38(t) halted in June 1942 when more than 1,400 had been built. Other examples of the Pz. 38(t) were also sold to a number of other Axis nations, including Hungary (102), Slovakia (69), Romania (50), and Bulgaria (10, known as &quot;Praga&quot;).

The main advantages of the Panzer 38(t), compared to other tanks of the day, were high reliability and sustained mobility. In one documented case, a regiment was supplied with tanks driven straight from the factory in 2.5 days instead of the anticipated week, without any mechanical breakdowns. In the opinion of the crews, the drive components of the Pz. 38(t) – engine, gear, steering, suspension, wheels and tracks – were perfectly in tune with each other. The Pz. 38(t) was also considered to be very easy to maintain and repair.

After production of the Pz. 38(t) ceased, the chassis was used for tank destroyer designs, which were produced in greater numbers than the original Pz. 38(t). In 1942–1944, about 1,500 Marder IIIs were produced. The Marder was replaced by the 38(t) (Hetzer), based on a modified Panzer 38(t) chassis, of which approximately 2,800 were produced. The Panzer 38(t) chassis was also the basis for an anti-aircraft gun carrier, the Flakpanzer 38(t), of which about 140 were produced. The 38(t) (designation Sd.Kfz.140/1) was a reconnaissance vehicle based on a 38(t) tank fitted with a open-topped turret with mesh covers (20 mm KwK 38 L/55 gun and a coaxial MG 42 – adapted from the Sd.Kfz. 222 armoured car); a support version armed with a 75 mm KwK 37 L/24 (and MG 42) gun mounted in the modified superstructure was also designed. Seventy 38(t) with a 20 mm gun were built in February and March 1944; just two 38(t) with a 75 mm gun were built in 1944.

=== Swedish production ===
Since the 90 PzKpfw 38(t) Ausf. S built for Sweden to be delivered in March 1940 were confiscated with the invasion of Czechoslovakia, negotiations with for the blue-prints needed for license production commenced and an agreement was reached at the end of 1940, which included the upgrades for the TNHP-S. The riveted construction was seen as a drawback, but since redrawing the blueprints for a welded construction was estimated to delay production by almost a year, no changes were made to the 116 m/41 ordered from Scania-Vabis in June 1941. Deliveries started in December 1942 and were completed in August 1943, no less than three years behind the original plan.

While clearly outdated, the need for a 10-ton light tank was so pressing that another order was placed in mid 1942. Since Scania-Vabis had reached the production ceiling, the 122 tanks had to be complemented by some 80 strv m/40. The second batch had the frontal armour upgraded to 50 mm bringing the weight to 11 tonnes, and to deal with the increased weight the 145 hp Scania-Vabis typ 1664 was replaced by a more powerful 160 hp Scania-Vabis typ 603. Due to the larger size, the hull had to be made 65 mm longer causing a wider gap between the second and third roadwheel. This enabled the fueltanks to be upgraded from 190 litres to 230 litres. Only 104 got delivered when production ended in March 1944; the last 18 chassis were built as the assault gun Stormartillerivagn m/43 instead. Another 18 Sav m/43 were purpose built.

At the end of the 1950s, 220 SI &amp; SII were converted to Pansarbandvagn 301 armoured personnel carriers and the turrets used for airbase defences.

== Operational history ==
=== Germany ===

The Panzer 38(t) performed well in the invasion of Poland in 1939 and the Battle of France in 1940. It was better armed than the Panzer I and Panzer II tanks. It was on a par with most light tank designs of the era, although it was unable to effectively engage the frontal armour of medium, heavy and infantry tank designs.

It was also used in the German invasion of the Soviet Union from 1941 onwards in German and Hungarian units but, like other Axis tanks, was outclassed by Soviet tanks such as the T-34. Some ex-German units were issued to the Romanians in 1943, after the loss of many of the Romanian R-2 tanks. By then, it had become largely obsolete, though the chassis was adapted to a variety of different roles with success. Notable variations include the Sd.Kfz. 138 Marder III mobile anti-tank gun, the Sd.Kfz. 138/1 Grille mobile howitzer, Flakpanzer 38(t) and the Jagdpanzer 38(t) &quot;Hetzer&quot; tank destroyer. Small numbers were also used for reconnaissance, training and security duties, such as deployment on armoured trains.

The German tank commander Otto Carius, who was credited with over 150 &#x27;kills&#x27;, described an action in a 38(t) on 8 July 1941:
The above report highlights the reason why the 38(t) was pulled out of front lines in favour of the heavier Panzer III, Panzer IV, and StuG III. Panzer 38(t) continued to serve after 1941 as a reconnaissance vehicle and in anti-partisan units for some time. Several captured examples were refitted with Soviet DTM machineguns and employed by the Red Army.

At the start of Operation Barbarossa, the Germans found Soviet T-34 tanks to be superior, as the German 37 mm Pak 36 anti-tank gun proved incapable of penetrating the T-34&#x27;s armour. To neutralize the T-34, the Germans mounted a captured Soviet 76.2 mm gun on the chassis of the 38(t) model as a stop-gap measure and called it the Marder III. Crews of early Marder III models fought exposed on top of the engine deck.

==== Campaigns ====
* Invasion of Poland with the German 3rd Light Division
* Operation Weserübung (Denmark) with the German 31st Army Corps
* Battle of France with the 7th Panzer, and 8th Panzer Divisions
* Operation Barbarossa and subsequent operations with the German 7th, 8th, 12th, 19th, 20th, 22nd Panzer Divisions, Hungarian First Armoured Field Division and Slovak Fast division
* Eastern Front operations with the Romanian 2nd Tank Regiment.
*Slovak National Uprising: 13 tanks of this type were used by the Slovak insurgent army.

=== Iran ===

Iran purchased 50 TNH tanks armed with a Skoda 37mm gun. A further order of 200 was interrupted by the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Iranian TNHs were assigned to the 1st and 2nd Divisions and the Imperial Guards but were overwhelmed by the 1000 tanks used by the Soviet Army in the Anglo-Soviet invasion in August 1941.

=== Peru ===

A Peruvian mission went to Europe in 1935 and looked at tanks from several major manufacturers before settling on the Czech LTP. Peru bought 24 of them. They were delivered in 1938–1939 and designated &quot; 38&quot; (then &quot; 39&quot;). This small armoured force of two tank companies was complemented by truck-mounted infantry and artillery pulled by tractors (the Czech ČKD). Peruvian doctrine was influenced by the French military mission operating in Peru at the time, and emphasized the use of tanks to support infantry attacks rather than in independent mobile columns (as in the German Blitzkrieg).

The Peruvian tank battalion played an important role in the 1941 Ecuadorian–Peruvian War, spearheading the attack across the Zarumilla River and at Arenillas. This was helped by the fact that the Ecuadorian Army had no modern anti-tank guns and their artillery was horse-drawn. Ultimately the last LTP tanks would see retirement from active service only in 1988.

The tanks were also used for counter-insurgency operations against the Shining Path.

=== Romania ===
The T-38 was the local designation for the wartime deliveries of Panzer 38(t)s from Germany in 1943. T-38 served with the forces operating in Kuban within 2nd Tank Regiment and later the 54th Company attached to the HQ and the cavalry corps in Kuban and Crimea. T-38 tanks were still in action with the 10th Infantry Division and Cavalry Divisions in 1944.

=== Slovakia ===

In the Slovak Army, this tank received the designation LT-38. Because of the first series of the LT-38 was not yet finished in March 1939, when Czechoslovakia dissolved, and as the first series was seized by Nazi Germany, the army of the Slovak State, which was a German ally in the Polish and Soviet campaigns, initially had only LT-35 tanks. In 1940 the Slovak Army ordered 10 tanks, which were used in Operation Barbarossa. All of them were used at the Eastern Front in the Fast division in the Battalion of Assault Vehicles. Two tanks were destroyed; the other 8 tanks later returned to Slovakia. After that, the Slovak Army ordered another 27 tanks, and when the Germans started withdrawing Panzer 38(t) tanks, the Slovak Army received another 37 tanks from Germany. Thirteen tanks of this type were used by Slovak insurgents during the Slovak National Uprising in 1944.

The Slovak Army also used the LT-40, which was based on the same chassis as the LT-38, but it was smaller and had a different turret. These tanks were initially manufactured for Lithuania, but because it was occupied by USSR from 1940, the order had been not realised. Instead, these tanks were acquired by Slovakia. Yet in 1940, the Slovak Army received 21 tanks. They were delivered without guns, machine guns, radio stations or optics. Slovak army equipped them with machine guns and the tanks took part in the Slovak army&#x27;s campaign in the USSR. During the battle near Lipovec, one tank was destroyed. Afterwards, the other machines were rearmed with Škoda A7 37 mm guns. Several tanks were used by the Slovak Army during the attack on the Caucasus, where some of them were lost in the fight. Remaining tanks were taken back to Slovakia, and some of them were used by Slovak Insurgent Army in the Slovak National Uprising in 1944.

One complete LT-38 tank in Slovak camouflage and one LT-38 torso are displayed in the Museum of the Slovak National Uprising in Banská Bystrica. Tank 313, the torso of which can be seen in the museum, was the third tank of the first order and saw combat on the Eastern front. Later it was used for training because of its high mileage. During the Slovak National Uprising it was used by insurgents, but because its engine failed, it was abandoned.

=== Sweden ===
All strv m/41 SI were sent to P 3 in Strängnäs, who were the only regiment who painted the road-wheels in the same camouflage pattern as the hull against regulations prescribing field-grey to be used. Most of the m/41 SII went to P 4 in Skövde, with a small number allocated to P 2 in Hässleholm and the material reserve of P 3.

All tanks had been retired from active service in the mid-1950s and later rebuilt into Pansarbandvagn 301 armoured personnel carriers (APCs).

<doc id="332285" wikidata="Q1495636" url="?curid=332285" title="Gastown">
<text>Gastown is the original settlement that became the core of the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and a national historic site and a neighbourhood in the northwest section of the Downtown Eastside, adjacent to Downtown Vancouver.

Its historical boundaries – the waterfront (now Water Street and the CPR tracks), Carrall Street, Hastings Street, and Cambie Street – followed the borders of the 1870 townsite survey, the proper name and postal address of which was Granville, B.I. (&quot;Burrard Inlet&quot;). The official boundary does not include most of Hastings Street except for the Woodward&#x27;s and Dominion Buildings, and stretches east past Columbia Street, to the laneway running parallel to the west side of Main Street.

==History== 

Gastown was Vancouver&#x27;s first neighbourhood and was named for &quot;Gassy&quot; Jack Deighton, a Yorkshire seaman, steamboat captain and barkeep who arrived in 1867 to open the area&#x27;s first saloon. He was famous for his habit of talking at length (or &quot;gassing&quot;) and the area around his saloon came to be known as &quot;Gassy&#x27;s town,&quot; a nickname that evolved to &quot;Gastown.&quot; The town soon prospered as the site of Hastings Mill sawmill, seaport, and quickly became a general centre of trade and commerce on Burrard Inlet as well as a rough-and-rowdy resort for off-work loggers and fishermen as well as the crews and captains of the many sailing ships which came to Gastown or Moodyville, on the north side of the inlet (which was a dry town) to load logs and timber.

In the 1960s, citizens became concerned with preserving Gastown&#x27;s distinctive and historic architecture, which like the nearby Chinatown and Strathcona was scheduled to be demolished to build a major freeway into the city&#x27;s downtown. A campaign led by businesspeople and property owners, as well as the counterculture and associated political protestors gained traction to save Gastown. Henk F. Vanderhorst, a Dutch immigrant to Canadian citizen, opened the &#x27;Exposition Gallery&#x27;, an art gallery on Water Street which started, flourished and encouraged a flow of other fledgling business startups to boom in the Gastown core. His influence with the revitalization of Gastown was acknowledged in 1976 by being awarded &#x27;The First Pioneer Citizen of Gastown&#x27; award by Mayor Art Phillips. &quot;A key to the city&quot;. Vanderhorst&#x27;s efforts, in part, pressured the civic, provincial and federal governments to declare Gastown a historical site, protecting its heritage buildings to this day.

Gastown was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2009.

==21st century==
Gastown is a mix of &quot;hip&quot; contemporary fashion and interior furnishing boutiques, tourist-oriented businesses (generally restricted to Water Street), restaurants, nightclubs, poverty and newly upscale housing. In addition, there are law firms, architecture and other professional offices, computer and internet businesses, art galleries, music and art studios, tattoo parlours, and acting and film schools.

In February 2013, The Gastown Gazette began publishing local news and stories about the ongoing protests against gentrification in the Downtown Eastside and Gastown area of Vancouver. The community paper has since gathered provincial and national attention for reports on the neighbourhood.

Gastown has become a hub for technology and new media. It has attracted companies such as Zaui Software, Idea Rebel, MetroQuest, BootUp Labs Entrepreneurial Society, SEOinVancouver and MarketR.

Popular annual events that take place on the cobblestone streets of Gastown include the Vancouver International Jazz Festival and the Global Relay Gastown Grand Prix international bicycle race.

In June 2004, Storyeum opened in Gastown. It was a lively theatrical 65-minute show that re-enacted the history of BC using eight sets that were all located below street level. Unfortunately, due to mounting debt, the attraction closed its doors in October 2006.

The Gassy Jack statue was toppled on February 14, 2022, by protesters during the 31st annual Memorial March for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.

In the summer of 2024, as a pilot project, Water Street was converted into a pedestrian zone with car-free and car-light areas from Richards Street to Carrall Street.

===Gastown steam clock===
Gastown&#x27;s most famous (though nowhere near oldest) landmark is the steam-powered clock on the corner of Cambie and Water Street. It was built in 1977 to cover a steam grate, part of Vancouver&#x27;s distributed steam heating system, as a way to harness the steam and to prevent street people from sleeping on the spot in cold weather. Its original design was faulty and it had to be powered by electricity after a breakdown. The steam mechanism was completely restored with the financial support of local businesses as it had become a major tourist attraction, and is promoted as a heritage feature although it is of modern invention.

The steam used is low pressure downtown-wide steam heating network (from a plant adjacent to the Georgia Viaduct) that powers a miniature steam engine in its base, in turn driving a chain lift. The chain lift moves steel balls upward, where they are unloaded and roll to a descending chain. The weight of the balls on the descending chain drives a conventional pendulum clock escapement, geared to the hands on the four faces. The steam also powers the clock&#x27;s sound production, with whistles being used instead of bells to produce the Westminster &quot;chime&quot; and to signal the time.

In October 2014, the clock was temporarily removed for major repairs by its original builder, and was reinstalled January 2015.

A major pay-per-view attraction throughout his career, Flair headlined the premier annual NWA/WCW event, Starrcade, on ten occasions, while also co-headlining its WWF counterpart, WrestleMania, in 1992, after winning that year&#x27;s Royal Rumble. &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; awarded him their PWI Wrestler of the Year award a record six times, while &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; named him the Wrestler of the Year (an award named after him and Lou Thesz) a record eight times. The first two-time WWE Hall of Fame inductee, first inducted with the class of 2008 for his individual career and again with the class of 2012 as a member of The Four Horsemen, he is also a member of the NWA Hall of Fame, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; Hall of Fame.

Flair is recognized by WWE as a 16-time world champion (8-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion, 6-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion, and two-time WWF Champion), although the number of his world championship reigns varies by source, ranging from 16 or 17 to 25. He has claimed to be a 21-time champion. He was the first holder of the WCW World Heavyweight Championship and the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship (which he also held last). As the inaugural WCW World Heavyweight Champion, he became the first person to complete the WCW Triple Crown, having already held the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship and WCW World Tag Team Championship. He then completed the WWE Triple Crown when he won the WWE Intercontinental Championship, after already holding the WWF Championship and the World Tag Team Championship.

== Early life ==
Fliehr was born on February 25, 1949, in Memphis, Tennessee. His original parents were Luther and Olive Phillips, the latter of whom was also credited with the Demaree and Stewart surnames; nevertheless, his birth name is commonly considered to be Fred Phillips, even if he is also credited on various records as Fred Demaree or Fred Stewart. He was adopted by Kathleen Kinsmiller Fliehr (1918–2003) and Richard Reid Fliehr (1918–2000). The Fliehrs decided to adopt due to Kathleen being unable to become pregnant after giving birth to a daughter who died shortly after. At the time of his adoption (arranged by the Tennessee Children&#x27;s Home Society as part of Georgia Tann&#x27;s infant trafficking scandal) his adoptive father was completing a residency in obstetrics and gynecology in Detroit, Michigan. His adoptive mother worked for the &quot;Star Tribune&quot;. Shortly afterward, the family settled in Edina, Minnesota, where the young Fliehr lived throughout his childhood.

After ninth grade, he attended Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin for four years, where he participated in wrestling, football, and track. After high school, Fliehr briefly attended the University of Minnesota.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== American Wrestling Association (1972–1974) ===
A successful amateur wrestler in his teens, Flair trained as a professional wrestler with Verne Gagne. He attended Gagne&#x27;s first wrestling camp with Greg Gagne, &quot;Jumpin Jim Brunzell, The Iron Sheik and Ken Patera at Gagne&#x27;s barn outside Minneapolis in the winter of 1971. On December 10, 1972, he made his debut in Rice Lake, Wisconsin, battling George &quot;Scrap Iron&quot; Gadaski to a 10-minute draw while adopting the ring name Ric Flair. During his time in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), Flair had matches with Dusty Rhodes, Chris Taylor, André the Giant, Larry Hennig and Wahoo McDaniel.

=== International Wrestling Enterprise (1973) ===
Flair made his first appearances in Japan in 1973 with International Wrestling Enterprise (IWE) as part of a working agreement between the IWE and AWA promoter Verne Gagne. He competed in IWE&#x27;s &quot;Big Summer Series&quot; throughout June and July, facing opponents such as Animal Hamaguchi, Great Kusatsu, Katsuzo Matsumoto, Mighty Inoue, and Rusher Kimura.

=== Jim Crockett Promotions / World Championship Wrestling (1974–1991) ===
==== Becoming the Nature Boy (1974–1981) ====

In 1974, Flair left the AWA for Jim Crockett&#x27;s Mid-Atlantic region in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), debuting on May 13, 1974, by defeating Abe Jacobs. Shortly after his debut, Flair won his first championship in the promotion, by teaming with Rip Hawk to defeat Bob Bruggers and Paul Jones to win the Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship. After a lengthy title reign, Flair and Hawk lost the titles to Paul Jones and Tiger Conway Jr. on December 6. Brute Bernard substituted for an inactive Hawk during the title defense. Flair would then capture his first singles title on February 9, 1975, by beating Paul Jones for the Mid-Atlantic Television Championship. After holding the title for six months, Flair lost the title back to Jones on August 8. During the same time, Flair began feuding with Wahoo McDaniel over the Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. After coming up short in several title opportunities, Flair finally defeated McDaniel for the title in a title vs. hair match on September 20.

On October 4, 1975, however, Flair&#x27;s career nearly ended when he was in a serious plane crash in Wilmington, North Carolina that took the life of the pilot and paralyzed Johnny Valentine (also on board were Mr. Wrestling, Bob Bruggers, and promoter David Crockett). Flair broke his back in three places and, at age 26, was told by doctors that he would never wrestle again. Flair conducted a rigorous physical therapy schedule, however, and he returned to the ring just three months later, where he resumed his feud with Wahoo McDaniel over the Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship in January 1976. The crash did force Flair to alter his wrestling technique away from the power brawling style he had used early on to one more focused on grappling, which led him to adopt the &quot;Nature Boy&quot; gimmick he would use throughout his career. Flair would ultimately lose the title back to McDaniel on May 3, 1976. However, three weeks later, Flair regained the title by defeating McDaniel in a rematch on May 24.

The title exchange with McDaniel continued as Flair lost the title to McDaniel in a steel cage match on September 11. On October 16, Flair defeated McDaniel in a title versus hair match to regain the Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. During this time, Flair teamed with Greg Valentine to defeat The Andersons (Gene Anderson and Ole Anderson) in a no disqualification match to win the Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship on December 26. The following day, Flair lost the Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship to Wahoo McDaniel in a no disqualification match. In the midst of his tag team championship reign, Flair defeated Rufus R. Jones to win his second Mid-Atlantic Television Championship on April 4, 1977. On May 8, Flair and Valentine lost the World Tag Team Championship back to Andersons in a steel cage match. A few days later, on May 15, Flair received his very first opportunity for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Harley Race. Race retained the title after the match ended in a double count-out. Flair would lose the Mid-Atlantic Television Championship to Ricky Steamboat on June 15, beginning a lengthy and historic rivalry between the two. On June 30, Flair and Valentine defeated Dino Bravo and Tiger Conway Jr. to win the Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship.

On July 29, Flair defeated Bobo Brazil to win his first NWA United States Heavyweight Championship in Richmond, Virginia. Flair and Valentine lost the Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship to Paul Jones and Ricky Steamboat on August 22. Flair would defend the United States Heavyweight Championship against numerous challengers, including Steamboat, whom he wrestled in several matches, such as title versus title match for Flair&#x27;s title and Steamboat&#x27;s Mid-Atlantic Television Championship. On October 30, Flair and Valentine defeated The Andersons to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. On October 20, Flair lost the United States Heavyweight Championship to Ricky Steamboat.

On March 30, 1978, Flair and Valentine were stripped of the World Tag Team Championship by NWA management due to continuously ending their matches via disqualification. On April 9, Flair defeated Mr. Wrestling in a title versus hair match to capture his second United States Heavyweight Championship. On October 30, Flair and John Studd defeated Paul Jones and Ricky Steamboat to win the Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship, but lost the titles back to Jones and Steamboat, five days later on November 5. After retaining the title against several challengers including Blackjack Mulligan and Jimmy Snuka, Flair lost the United States Heavyweight Championship to Steamboat on December 17. Flair would then come up short against Steamboat in several title challenges, before defeating him in a steel cage match to win his third United States Heavyweight Championship on April 1, 1979. During this time, Flair began feuding with the original &quot;Nature Boy&quot; Buddy Rogers, due to Flair referring to himself as &quot;The Nature Boy&quot;. The rivalry concluded in a match between the two at &quot;Battle of the Nature Boys&quot; on July 8, in which Flair defended the United States Heavyweight Championship against Rogers. Rogers put Flair over in the match, leading to Flair retaining the title and cementing his place as the new &quot;Nature Boy&quot; of professional wrestling.

A month later, on August 12, Flair teamed with Blackjack Mulligan to defeat Baron von Raschke and Paul Jones to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Flair and Mulligan lost the titles back to Raschke and Jones on August 22. Flair would then begin feuding with Jimmy Snuka over the United States Heavyweight Championship, defeating him to win the title for a fourth time on April 20, 1980. Flair lost the title to his former tag team partner Greg Valentine on July 26. Flair defeated Valentine in a lumberjack match to win his fifth United States Heavyweight Championship on November 24. On January 27, 1981, Flair lost the title to Roddy Piper in a title versus title match, where Flair&#x27;s United States Heavyweight Championship and Piper&#x27;s Television Championship were on the line. The United States Heavyweight Championship&#x27;s current owner WWE does not recognize the title exchange with Greg Valentine and recognizes Flair&#x27;s reign uninterrupted from April 20 to January 27. Flair would face Piper in various rematches for the title throughout the year but failed to regain the title.

==== NWA World Heavyweight Champion (1981–1991) ====
On September 17, 1981, Flair beat Dusty Rhodes for his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship. In the following years, Flair established himself as the promotion&#x27;s main franchise in the midst of emerging competition from Vince McMahon&#x27;s World Wrestling Federation (WWF). An unsanctioned title loss took place on January 6, 1983, to Carlos Colón Sr. in Puerto Rico. Flair recovered the championship belt in a phantom change seventeen days later not officially recognized by the NWA. Harley Race won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Flair in 1983, but Flair regained the title at Starrcade in a steel cage match. Officially, Flair won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship eight more times. Flair lost the title to Race and won it back in the span of three days in New Zealand and Singapore in March 1984. At the 1st David Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions at Texas Stadium, Flair was pinned by Kerry Von Erich, but he regained the title eighteen days later in Japan and reigned for two years, two months and two days, losing the title to Dusty Rhodes on July 26, 1986, at The Great American Bash in a Steel Cage Match. However, Flair regained the title at a house show on August 9, when Rhodes passed out in the Figure Four leglock.

In late 1985, the tag team of Arn Anderson and Ole Anderson began aiding Flair (whom they claimed as a &quot;cousin&quot;) in attacks against Dusty Rhodes, Magnum T.A. and Sam Houston. A few weeks later, the Andersons interrupted Houston&#x27;s match against Tully Blanchard and the three villains combined to rough up the youngster. Shortly thereafter, Flair, Blanchard and the Andersons formalized their alliance, calling themselves The Four Horsemen, with Blanchard&#x27;s manager J. J. Dillon also coming on board. Upon the group&#x27;s inception, it was clear that The Four Horsemen were unlike any villainous alliance that had ever existed, as the four rule breakers immediately used their strength in numbers to decimate the NWA&#x27;s top fan favorites (most famously a vicious beatdown to Rhodes with a baseball bat in a parking lot) while controlling the majority of the championship titles.
By 1986, wrestling promoter Jim Crockett had consolidated the various NWA member promotions he owned into a single entity, running under the banner of the National Wrestling Alliance. Controlling much of the traditional NWA territories in the southeast and Midwestern United States, Crockett looked to expand nationally and built his promotion around Flair as champion. During this time, Flair&#x27;s bookings as champion were tightly controlled by Crockett, and a custom championship belt was created for Flair. Flair lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in Detroit to Ron Garvin on September 25, 1987. Garvin held the title for two months before losing to Flair on November 26, 1987, at WCW&#x27;s first pay-per-view event, Starrcade, in Chicago.
In early 1988, Sting and Flair fought to a 45-minute time-limit draw at the first ever &quot;Clash of the Champions&quot;. On February 20, 1989, at Chi-Town Rumble in Chicago, Ricky Steamboat pinned Flair to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. This prompted a series of rematches, where Steamboat was presented as a &quot;family man&quot; (often accompanied by his wife and young son), while Flair opposed him as an immoral, fast-living &quot;ladies man&quot;. Following a best-of-three falls match with Steamboat that lasted just short of the 60-minute time limit (and ended with a disputed finish where Steamboat retained the title) at &quot;Clash of the Champions VI: Ragin&#x27; Cajun&quot; on April 2, Flair regained the title from Steamboat on May 7, 1989, at WrestleWar in a match that was voted 1989&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Year&quot; by &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot;. On July 23, 1989, Flair defeated Terry Funk at The Great American Bash, but the two continued to feud through the summer and eventually Flair reformed The Four Horsemen, with the surprise addition of longtime rival Sting, to combat Funk&#x27;s J-Tex Corporation. This led to an &quot;I Quit&quot; match at &quot;Clash of the Champions IX: New York Knockout&quot; which Flair won. Flair then kicked Sting out of The Four Horsemen upon his challenge for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, resulting in a revived feud between the two. On July 7, 1990, Flair dropped the title to Sting at The Great American Bash. After being unmasked as The Black Scorpion at Starrcade in 1990, Flair regained the title from Sting on January 11, 1991.

Subsequent to this title win, Flair was recognized by WCW as the first WCW World Heavyweight Champion, though he was still also recognized as NWA World Heavyweight Champion. On March 21, 1991, Tatsumi Fujinami defeated Flair in a match in Tokyo at the WCW/New Japan Supershow. While the NWA recognized Fujinami as their new champion, WCW did not because Fujinami had backdropped Flair over the top rope in a violation of WCW rules. On May 19, 1991, Flair defeated Fujinami at SuperBrawl I in St. Petersburg, Florida to reclaim the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and retain the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. In the spring of 1991, Flair had a contract dispute with WCW president Jim Herd, who wanted him to take a substantial pay cut. Flair had resigned as head booker in February 1990 and Herd wanted to reduce Flair&#x27;s role in the promotion even further, despite the fact that Flair was still a top draw. According to Flair, Herd also proposed changes in his appearance and ring name (i.e. by shaving his hair, wearing a diamond earring and going by the name Spartacus) in order to &quot;change with the times&quot;. Flair disagreed with the proposals and two weeks before The Great American Bash, Herd fired him and vacated the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. While Flair had left for the WWF, he was still recognized as the NWA World Heavyweight Champion until September 8, when the title was officially vacated.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (1978–1987) ===
While working for Jim Crockett Jr.&#x27;s Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW), Flair began working tours for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). On April 27, 1978, Flair challenged for the NWA United National Championship in a losing effort. Throughout the 1980s, Flair defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in All Japan against the likes of Genichiro Tenryu, Riki Choshu, Jumbo Tsuruta, Harley Race, and Kerry Von Erich. On October 21, 1985, Flair wrestled Rick Martel in a double title match where he defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and challenged for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, but the match ended in a double countout. As All Japan withdrew from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in the late 1980s, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) began a working agreement with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW).

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1989–1991, 1995–1996) ===
In 1989, the working agreement led to a feud between Flair and Keiji Mutoh, who was wrestling under The Great Muta gimmick, in the United States for WCW. On March 21, 1991, Flair defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and challenged Tatsumi Fujinami for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in a double title match on the WCW/New Japan Supershow at the Tokyo Dome. Fujinami beat Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but later lost the title at WCW&#x27;s SuperBrawl I on May 19, 1991, in the United States.

In August 1995, while under WCW contract, Flair participated in the G1 Climax tournament in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he beat Shiro Koshinaka, drew Masahiro Chono, and lost to Keiji Mutoh. On July 17, 1996, Flair challenged Shinya Hashimoto for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort in NJPW.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1991–1993) ===
Flair signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in August 1991. His arrival was hyped by Bobby Heenan, beginning with the August 11 episode of &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;. On the September 21 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, Flair debuted in WWF with the Big Gold Belt, calling himself &quot;The Real World&#x27;s Champion&quot;. Led by his &quot;financial adviser&quot; Bobby Heenan and his &quot;executive consultant&quot; Mr. Perfect, Flair repeatedly issued challenges to WWF wrestlers like &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper and Hulk Hogan. His first match with the promotion saw him wrestle Mark Thomas to a no contest on the September 28 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot; by provoking Piper to attack him, and Flair then attacked Piper with the Big Gold Belt and a chair. His first televised win in WWF occurred on the September 29 episode of &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot; by squashing Jim Powers. Flair wrestled a team led by Piper at Survivor Series in November and helped The Undertaker defeat Hogan for the WWF Championship that same night. WCW sued Flair in an attempt to reclaim the championship belt, but Flair claimed otherwise due to a loophole in NWA policy; at the time he first became champion, the NWA required all of the wrestlers that it selected to be world champion to put down a security deposit of $25,000, which, in effect, resulted in the belt being leased to any wrestler who held it. The NWA, in usual cases, would return the deposit and any interest that may have accumulated upon the conclusion of the wrestler&#x27;s championship reign. They did not do this for Flair before he was terminated by WCW, and since the money was still owed to him by the NWA upon his signing with the WWF, Flair believed that the title belt had become his personal property to do with as he pleased.

At the 1992 Royal Rumble, Flair won the namesake match to claim the vacant WWF Championship. Flair entered as number three in the Rumble match and lasted 60 minutes, last eliminating Sid Justice with help from Hulk Hogan, who had been eliminated by Justice seconds earlier. In February 1992, Flair faced the Intercontinental Champion Roddy Piper in a series of inconclusive title-versus-title matches. Randy Savage then challenged Flair for the WWF Championship as part of the double main event at WrestleMania VIII. In the storyline, Flair taunted Savage by claiming that he had a prior relationship with Savage&#x27;s wife, Miss Elizabeth. Savage defeated Flair for the title at WrestleMania. In July 1992, as Savage prepared to defend the title against The Ultimate Warrior at SummerSlam, Flair and Mr. Perfect sowed distrust between the two by suggesting that they would back one or the other during their match. They actually attacked both Savage and Warrior, resulting in the latter winning by countout, and injured Savage&#x27;s knee, an injury that Flair exploited to regain the title in a match with Savage three days later on September 1 in Hershey, Pennsylvania, which aired on the September 14 episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;. On September 15, 1992, Flair defended the WWF Championship against Genichiro Tenryu at a Wrestle Association R event in Yokohama, Japan; the match ended in a draw. Flair&#x27;s second reign ended when he lost the title to Bret Hart on October 12 at a house show.

Flair teamed with Razor Ramon to take on Savage and Perfect at the Survivor Series in November 1992. Flair appeared in the Royal Rumble in January 1993, then lost a Loser Leaves the WWF match to Mr. Perfect on the January 25 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. Flair had a verbal agreement with Vince McMahon with the condition that if he wasn&#x27;t going to be used in a main event position and had an offer to go elsewhere, he would be released from his contract. He opted to leave WWF when he was going to be moved to a mid-card position and Bill Watts offered to come back to WCW. Flair then fulfilled his remaining house show commitments and took part in the WWF&#x27;s &quot;Winter Tour &#x27;93&quot; of Europe. He made his last appearance with the WWF on February 11, 1993, before returning to WCW.

=== Super World of Sports (1992) ===
In April 1992, Flair toured Japan with the Super World of Sports (SWS) promotion as part of an agreement between the WWF and SWS. In his first bout, he teamed with The Natural Disasters to defeat Ashura Hara, Genichiro Tenryu, and Takashi Ishikawa in a six-man tag team match. He went on to defeat Tenryu in a singles match, then lost to Tenryu in a two-out-of-three falls match.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1993–2001) ===
==== WCW World Heavyweight Champion (1993–1996) ====
Flair triumphantly returned to WCW as a hero in February 1993. As a result of a &quot;no-compete&quot; clause he was initially unable to wrestle, so he hosted a short-lived talk show in WCW called &quot;A Flair for the Gold&quot;. Arn Anderson usually appeared at the bar on the show&#x27;s set, and Flair&#x27;s maid Fifi cleaned or bore gifts. Once he returned to action, Flair briefly held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship for a tenth time after defeating Barry Windham at Beach Blast before WCW finally left the NWA in September 1993. At Fall Brawl, Flair lost the title, now rebranded the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship, to &quot;Ravishing Rick&quot; Rude. At Starrcade in 1993, Flair defeated Vader to win the WCW World Heavyweight title for the second time. In the spring of 1994, Flair began a tweener turn and started another feud with longtime rival Ricky Steamboat and challenged Steamboat to a match at Spring Stampede which ended in a no contest from a double pin, causing the title to be held up. Flair then defeated Steamboat in a rematch to reclaim the held-up title on an episode of WCW Saturday Night. The WWE does not count this victory as a new title win. Flair then challenged Col. Robert Parker to wrestle one of his men at Slamboree, which turned out to be Barry Windham, whom Flair defeated, afterwards he quietly turned heel and took Sherri Martel as his manager. He would also wrestle Lord Steven Regal in a five-match series under Marquess of Queensberry Rules, which aired on WCW Worldwide between April 30 and May 28, in which Flair won the series, with 2 wins, 1 loss, and 2 draws.

In June 1994 at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXVII&quot;, Flair defeated Sting in a unification match, merging the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship with the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, and solidifying his heel turn after his alliance with Sherri was brought into the open after she helped him win the match while pretending that she had sided with Sting. After becoming the unified and undisputed WCW champion, Flair feuded with Hulk Hogan upon Hogan&#x27;s arrival in WCW in June 1994, losing the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to him in July at Bash at the Beach. Flair continued to feud with Hogan and finally lost to Hogan in a steel cage retirement match at Halloween Havoc. Flair took a few months off afterwards before returning to WCW television in January 1995 for an interview at Clash of the Champions XXX. After attacking Hogan at Superbrawl V, Flair also began appearing as a part-time manager for Vader, who was engaged in feud with Hogan, and developed a short-lived angle where he was &quot;possessed&quot;, even attacking his old WWF opponent Randy Savage at the first Uncensored. He soon afterwards returned to wrestling (explained on-air by having Flair nag Hogan for months until Hogan and Savage both petitioned WCW management to let Flair come back). Upon returning to wrestling, Flair quickly revived his 1992 feud with Savage, but this time also got Savage&#x27;s father Angelo Poffo involved after he put him in a figure four leglock at Slamboree 1995.

On April 29, 1995, Flair wrestled Antonio Inoki in front of 190,000 spectators in Pyongyang, North Korea at the May Day Stadium in a losing effort under a joint show between New Japan Pro-Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling. The event was broadcast on August 4, 1995, on pay-per-view under the title of Collision in Korea. In the fall of 1995, Flair began a short feud with Arn Anderson, which culminated in a tag match that saw Flair turning on Sting to reform the new Four Horsemen with Flair as the leader, Arn Anderson, Brian Pillman, and Chris Benoit as the members. With the new Four Horsemen, Flair won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship two more times before the nWo invasion storyline began in WCW, with the first one being in December 1995 at Starrcade, where Flair defeated Lex Luger and Sting by countout and then defeated Savage after all three Four Horsemen members ran to the ring and Arn Anderson knocked out Savage with brass knuckles, thus allowing Flair to pin Savage to win the match and the title. Afterwards Savage won the title back on &quot;Nitro&quot; after Starcade, but Flair won the next match at SuperBrawl VI to regain the championship. During the feud, Savage&#x27;s manager Miss Elizabeth turned against him and became Flair&#x27;s valet. Together with Woman and Debra McMichael they would escort Flair to his matches until Miss Elizabeth was taken by the nWo in the fall and eventually returned as Savage&#x27;s valet when he joined the nWo in 1997. Flair lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship eventually three months later to The Giant. The feud with Savage continued with The New Four Horseman joining the Dungeon of Doom to create an Alliance to end Hulkamania. Together the factions wrestled Hogan and Savage in a triple steel cage, End of Hulkamania match; losing to the reunited Mega Powers. Afterwards, Flair went on to win the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship and there were also changes in the Four Horseman in 1996, as Brian Pillman left WCW and Steve &quot;Mongo&quot; McMichael became the fourth member.

==== Feud with the New World Order (1996–1999) ====
Once again as a top fan favorite, Flair played a major role in the New World Order (nWo) invasion storyline in late 1996 and throughout 1997. He and the other Horsemen often took the lead in the war against Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, and Hollywood Hulk Hogan, whom Flair immediately challenged for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at the &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXIII&quot;, but won only by disqualification. In September 1996, Flair and Anderson teamed with their bitter rivals, Sting and Lex Luger, to lose to the nWo (Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and an impostor Sting) in the WarGames match at Fall Brawl when Luger submitted to the impostor Sting&#x27;s Scorpion Deathlock.

In October 1996, two developments occurred that affected the Four Horsemen when Jeff Jarrett came over to WCW from the WWF, and expressed his desire to join the Horsemen as he immediately gained a fan in Ric Flair, much to the chagrin of the other Horsemen. Flair finally let Jarrett join the group in February 1997, but the others did not want him, and in July 1997 was ultimately kicked out of the group by Flair himself, who had enough of the instability Jarrett&#x27;s presence caused the Horsemen. Flair also feuded with Roddy Piper, Syxx, and his old nemesis Curt Hennig in 1997, after Hennig was offered a spot in The Four Horsemen only to turn on Flair and The Four Horsemen at Fall Brawl in September 1997, in which Hennig punctuated the act by slamming the cage door onto Flair&#x27;s head.

In April 1998, Flair disappeared from WCW television, due to a lawsuit filed by Eric Bischoff for no-showing a live episode of &quot;Thunder&quot; on April 9, 1998, in Tallahassee, Florida. After the case was settled, Flair made a surprise return on September 14, 1998, to ceremoniously reform the Four Horsemen (along with Steve McMichael, Dean Malenko, and Chris Benoit). Flair feuded with Bischoff for several months afterward. Flair repeatedly raked Eric Bischoff&#x27;s eyes during this feud. This culminated in a match at Starrcade between Bischoff and Flair in December 1998, which Bischoff won after interference from Curt Hennig, a former member of the Four Horsemen. The following night in Baltimore on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Flair returned and threatened to leave WCW, demanding a match against Bischoff for the presidency of the company. The match was made, and despite the nWo interfering on Bischoff&#x27;s behalf Flair won and was granted the position of president of WCW. This resulted in a match at SuperBrawl IX between Flair and Hollywood Hogan for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which Flair lost after being betrayed by his own son David Flair.

==== Final world championship reigns (1999–2001) ====

In spite of his son&#x27;s betrayal, Flair signed a rematch at Uncensored on March 14 which was billed as a First Blood barbed wire steel cage Match against Hogan where Flair&#x27;s presidency and Hogan&#x27;s WCW World Heavyweight Championship were on the line. Despite being the first to bleed, Flair won the match by pinfall thanks to the bias of the referee Charles Robinson, who counted Hogan out.

As on-air WCW President, Flair began abusing his power much like Bischoff had, favoring villains over fan favorites and even awarding the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship (which was vacated by Scott Steiner due to injury) to his son David and resorting to whatever means necessary to keep him as United States Heavyweight Champion. Flair eventually formed a stable of followers which included Roddy Piper, Arn Anderson and the Jersey Triad to keep things in order. Flair&#x27;s reign as president came to an end on the July 19 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, when he faced and lost to Sting for the position. During the course of the match, Sting had Flair in his Scorpion Death Lock, but with the referee knocked unconscious, no decision could be reached. A returning Eric Bischoff came to the ring and began ordering the timekeeper to ring the bell, which he eventually did, awarding the match and the presidency to Sting (who promptly gave it up upon receiving it).

Flair won his last world titles in his career by winning the WCW World Heavyweight Championship twice during 2000, the company&#x27;s last full year of operation. When WCW was purchased by the WWF in March 2001, Flair was the leader of the villainous group called the Magnificent Seven. Flair lost the final match of &quot;Nitro&quot; to Sting, recreating the second match of &quot;Nitro&quot; in 1995. Nevertheless, Flair has repeatedly stated in various interviews how happy he was when WCW finally closed down, although at the same time the fact that many people would lose their jobs saddened him.

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (2001–2009) ===
==== WWF co-owner (2001–2002) ====

After an eight-month hiatus from wrestling, Flair made a return to the WWF on November 19, 2001. Flair reappeared on &quot;Raw&quot; following the end of the &quot;WCW/ECW Invasion&quot; that culminated in a &quot;Winner Take All&quot; match at Survivor Series on November 18 won by the WWF. Flair&#x27;s new on-screen role was that of the co-owner of the WWF, with the explanation that Shane and Stephanie McMahon had sold their stock in the company to a consortium (namely Flair) prior to purchasing World Championship Wrestling and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). Flair&#x27;s feud with Vince McMahon led them to a match at the Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002 in a Street Fight, where Flair defeated McMahon. Flair also wrestled The Undertaker at WrestleMania X8 on March 17 where Flair lost. The &quot;co-owner&quot; angle culminated in early 2002, when Flair controlled &quot;Raw&quot; and McMahon controlled &quot;SmackDown!&quot;

On the May 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair challenged Hollywood Hulk Hogan to a no disqualification match for the Undisputed WWE Championship. Flair would later lose the contest before moving onto a rivalry with Stone Cold Steve Austin. At Judgment Day on May 19, Flair teamed with Big Show and lost to Austin in a two-on-one handicap tag team match. On the June 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the feud between Flair and Austin would escalate after Austin defeated Flair in a singles contest. After Austin abruptly left the WWE in June while in a program with Flair, a match was hotshotted between Flair and McMahon for sole ownership of WWE, which Flair lost after interference from Brock Lesnar on the June 10 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;.

At King of the Ring on June 23, Flair defeated Eddie Guerrero in a singles match after Guerrero and Chris Benoit would interrupt Flair&#x27;s speech regarding losing his position as WWE co-owner; afterwards, Guerrero would lock Flair in his own signature figure four leg lock with help from Benoit. Flair&#x27;s rivalry with Lesnar would continue into the month of July with Lesnar picking up wins over Flair in a singles match on the July 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and in a tag team contest on the July 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Flair then became involved in a short-lived rivalry with Chris Jericho, leading to Flair defeating Jericho at SummerSlam on August 25. Flair was granted a World Heavyweight Championship match against Triple H on the September 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, which he lost. Later on that same night, Flair would team with Rob Van Dam as the duo were successful in defeating the team of Triple H and Jericho. At Unforgiven on September 22, Flair was unsuccessful in capturing the WWE Intercontinental Championship in a singles contest against Jericho.

Under the WWE banner, Flair toured Japan periodically between 2002 and 2008. He successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship with Batista against The Dudley Boyz twice in February 2004. On the February 7, 2005 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, broadcast from the Saitama Super Arena in Japan, Flair lost to Shawn Michaels in a singles match. In February 2008, Flair wrestled Mr. Kennedy in the Ariake Coliseum and William Regal in the Budokan Hall, both under the stipulation that he would retire if he lost.

==== Evolution (2002–2005) ====

In September 2002 at Unforgiven, Triple H defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Rob Van Dam. During the match, Flair came down to the ring and grabbed the sledgehammer from Triple H and teased hitting him before hitting Van Dam, allowing Triple H to get the win, turning him heel in the process and accompanied Triple H to the ring as his manager. Shortly after, Batista moved from &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to &quot;Raw&quot; and Flair also began accompanying him to the ring while continuing to second Triple H. In June 2003 at Bad Blood, Flair was able to defeat Shawn Michaels after Randy Orton struck Michaels with a chair.

At the height of Evolution&#x27;s power, the group controlled all of the male-based championships of &quot;Raw&quot; after Armageddon. Batista teamed with Flair to win the World Tag Team Championship from the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) in a tag team turmoil match and Triple H regained the World Heavyweight Championship from Goldberg (in a triple threat match that also involved Kane), with the help of the other members of Evolution. In January 2004 at the Royal Rumble, Flair and Batista successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship against the Dudley Boyz in a tables match, and World Heavyweight Champion Triple H fought Shawn Michaels to no contest in a Last Man Standing match, thus retaining the championship. Flair and Batista lost the World Tag Team Championship on February 16 edition of &quot;Raw&quot; to Booker T and Rob Van Dam. At WrestleMania XX, Evolution defeated the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Sock Connection (The Rock and Mick Foley) in a 3-on-2 handicap match. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot; during the 2004 WWE draft lottery, Flair and Batista defeated Booker T and Rob Van Dam to win their second and final World Tag Team Championship, but they lost the titles to World Heavyweight Champion Chris Benoit and Edge on the April 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

At SummerSlam, Orton pinned Benoit to become the new World Heavyweight Champion and the youngest World Champion in WWE history to date. On the episode of &quot;Raw&quot; the night after SummerSlam, Batista hoisted Orton on to his shoulders in what appeared to be a celebration, but following the thumbs down from Triple H, the group proceeded to attack Orton. At Unforgiven, Triple H beat Orton to regain the World Heavyweight Championship, with help from Flair, Batista, and Jonathan Coachman. Orton&#x27;s feud with Evolution continued until Survivor Series where Triple H, Batista, Gene Snitsky, and Edge were defeated by Orton, Maven, Chris Jericho, and Chris Benoit in a Survivor Series match for control of &quot;Raw&quot; over the following month.

In the Elimination Chamber match at New Year&#x27;s Revolution, Batista, Orton and Triple H were the last three remaining in the match. Orton eliminated Batista with a RKO and Triple H pinned Orton with Batista&#x27;s help to win the title. Triple H suggested that Batista not enter the Royal Rumble match, wanting the group to focus on Triple H retaining the title. At the Royal Rumble, Batista declined, entered the Rumble at number 28 and won. Triple H tried to persuade Batista to challenge the WWE Champion John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield of SmackDown! rather than for his World Heavyweight Championship. This involved Triple H plotting a feud between JBL and Batista, showing JBL badmouthing Batista in an interview and staging an attack on Batista with a limousine designed to look like Layfield&#x27;s. The scheme was unsuccessful and at the brand contract signing ceremony on the February 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista chose to remain on Raw, infuriating Triple H and thus quitting the faction. Batista defeated Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 21. Flair and Triple H also starred in an ad for WrestleMania 21 that parodied the film &quot;Braveheart&quot;.

After Vengeance, Triple H took time off and Flair turned face for the first time since 2002 before going on to win the Intercontinental Championship from Carlito at Unforgiven, and the group was dissolved. Triple H returned at the &quot;Homecoming&quot; episode of &quot;Raw&quot; on October 3 where he was to team with Flair in a tag team match against Carlito and Chris Masters. After winning that match, Triple H betrayed Flair and attacked him with a sledgehammer. Flair retained the Intercontinental Championship against Triple H at Taboo Tuesday in a steel cage match, which was voted as such by the fans. Flair later lost to Triple H in an acclaimed Last Man Standing non-title match at Survivor Series, which ended their feud.

==== Final storylines and first retirement (2005–2008) ====
At the end of 2005, Flair had a feud with Edge that culminated in a WWE Championship Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match on &quot;Raw&quot; in early 2006, which Flair lost. On the February 20 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair lost the Intercontinental Championship to Shelton Benjamin, thus ending his reign at 155 days. Flair took some time off in mid-2006 to rest and marry for the third time and he returned in June to work a program with his real-life rival Mick Foley that played off their legitimate past animosity. Flair defeated Foley at Vengeance in a two out of three falls match, then at SummerSlam in an &quot;I quit&quot; match.
Subsequently, he was involved in a rivalry with the Spirit Squad on &quot;Raw&quot;. On November 5, 2006, at Cyber Sunday, he captured the World Tag Team Championship from the Spirit Squad with Roddy Piper. On the November 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair and Piper lost the World Tag Team Championship to Rated-RKO, due to a disc problem with Piper and had to be flown immediately back to the United States as soon as &quot;Raw&quot; was off the air. On November 26, 2006, at Survivor Series, Flair was the sole survivor of a match that featured himself, Ron Simmons (replacing an injured Piper), Dusty Rhodes and Sgt. Slaughter versus the Spirit Squad.

Flair then began teaming with Carlito after Flair said that Carlito had no heart. Flair defeated Carlito in a match after which Carlito realized that Flair was right. Flair and Carlito faced off against Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch in a number one contender&#x27;s match for the World Tag Team Championship, but were defeated. The two teamed up on the WrestleMania 23 pre-show, and defeated the team of Chavo Guerrero and Gregory Helms. After weeks of conflict between Flair and Carlito, the team split up when Carlito attacked Flair during a match on the April 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. At Judgment Day, Flair defeated Carlito with the figure four leglock.

On the June 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair was drafted to the SmackDown! brand as part of the 2007 WWE draft. He briefly feuded against Montel Vontavious Porter, unsuccessfully challenging him for the WWE United States Championship at . Flair rejoined forces with Batista to feud with The Great Khali; the alliance was short-lived, however, as Flair was &quot;injured&quot; during a match with Khali on the August 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

After a three-month hiatus, Flair returned to WWE programming on the November 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to announce &quot;I will never retire&quot;. Vince McMahon retaliated by announcing that the next match Flair lost would result in a forced retirement. Later in the night, Flair defeated Orton after a distraction by Chris Jericho. It was revealed on the 15th anniversary of &quot;Raw&quot; that the win or retire ultimatum only applied in singles matches. Flair won several &quot;career threatening&quot; matches against the opponents such as Triple H, Umaga, William Regal, Mr. Kennedy, and Vince McMahon himself among others. On March 29, 2008, Flair was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a part of the class of 2008 by Triple H. The day after, Flair wrestled at WrestleMania XXIV in Orlando, Florida, losing to Shawn Michaels. The match was lauded by fans and critics and was voted the 2008 &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; (PWI) Match of the Year. Flair&#x27;s fight to keep his career going garnered him the 2008 &quot;PWI&quot; &quot;Most Inspirational Wrestler of the Year&quot; award.

==== Part-time appearances (2008–2009) ====

On the March 31, 2008 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair delivered his farewell address. Afterward, Triple H brought out many current and retired superstars to thank Flair for all he had done, including Shawn Michaels, some of the Four Horsemen, Ricky Steamboat, Harley Race, and Chris Jericho, followed by The Undertaker and then Vince McMahon. Along with the wrestlers, the fans gave Flair a standing ovation. This event represented a rare moment in WWE as both the heels and the faces broke character and came out to the ring together. Flair made his first post retirement appearance on the June 16, 2008 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to confront Chris Jericho about his actions during a rivalry with Shawn Michaels. He challenged Jericho to a fight in the parking lot, rather than an official match, but Jericho was stopped by Triple H.

The following year on February 9, Flair once again confronted Jericho on &quot;Raw&quot;. Jericho was attacking Hall of Fame members and Flair demanded he respect them, before punching Jericho. Flair appeared a month later to distract him during a Money in the Bank Qualifying Match. Jericho then challenged Flair to come out of retirement for WrestleMania 25; instead Flair managed Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka and Ricky Steamboat in a three-on-one handicap match at WrestleMania in a losing effort. On May 17, Flair returned during the Judgment Day pay-per-view, coming to the aid of Batista, who was being attacked by The Legacy (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase). On the June 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair challenged Orton in a parking lot brawl match, and after interference from the rest of The Legacy, the fight ended with Flair trapped inside a steel cage and punted by Orton.

=== Ring of Honor and the Hulkamania Tour (2009) ===

Flair signed with Ring of Honor (ROH) and appeared at the &quot;Stylin&#x27; And Profilin&quot;&#x27; event in March 2009, clearing the ring after an ROH World Championship match ended with a run-in. He soon served as the company&#x27;s ambassador, in an on-screen authority role, and appeared on the television show &quot;Ring of Honor Wrestling&quot; in May to cement his role. After a number one contender&#x27;s match ended in a time-limit draw, and the following week a double count out, Flair announced &quot;Ring of Honor Wrestling&#x27;s&quot; first ROH World Title match as a four-way contest.

On November 21, 2009, Flair returned to the ring as a villain on the &quot;&quot; tour of Australia, losing to Hulk Hogan in the main event of the first show by brass knuckles. Hogan defeated Flair again on November 24 in Perth, Australia after both men bled heavily. Flair also lost to Hogan on the two remaining matches on the tour.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2010–2012) ===
====Debut and Fortune (2010)====
On the January 4, 2010 episode of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s (TNA) &quot;Impact!&quot;, Flair made his debut appearance for the company arriving via limo and later observing the main event between A.J. Styles and longtime rival Kurt Angle. It was later reported that Flair had signed a one-year deal with the company. In the past, Flair had openly stated that he was loyal to the McMahons and wanted to end his career in WWE, however he had not had contact from WWE since June 2009 and decided to sign with TNA after waiting for the call from WWE for six months. On January 17 at Genesis, Flair helped Styles cheat to pin Angle and retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.

In addition to Styles, Flair began informally managing Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) and Desmond Wolfe as a loose alliance. On the March 8 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Hulk Hogan and Abyss defeated Flair and Styles when Abyss pinned Styles. Afterwards, the returning Jeff Hardy saved Abyss and Hogan from a beatdown at the hands of Flair, Styles and Beer Money, Inc. At Lockdown, Team Flair (Ric Flair, Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) was defeated by Team Hogan (Hulk Hogan, Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Jeff Hardy and Rob Van Dam) in a Lethal Lockdown match. On the April 26 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Flair was defeated by Abyss in a match where Flair&#x27;s and Hogan&#x27;s WWE Hall of Fame rings were at stake, and as a result Flair lost possession of his ring to Hogan. The following week, Hogan gave the ring to Jay Lethal, who returned it to Flair out of respect. This, however, was not enough for Flair, who attacked Lethal along with the members of Team Flair. After Styles dropped the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Rob Van Dam, then failed to regain it in a rematch and later was pinned by Jay Lethal, Flair adopted Kazarian as his newest protégé, seemingly replacing Styles as his number one wrestler.

On the June 17 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Flair announced that he would reform the Four Horsemen under the new name , a group consisting of A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, and James Storm. Flair made a return to the ring on July 11 at Victory Road, losing to Jay Lethal. On the August 5 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Flair faced Lethal in a rematch, this time contested under Street Fight rules, with the members of banned from ringside; Flair managed to win the match after an interference from Douglas Williams. The following week, Williams and Matt Morgan were added to . In the weeks leading to Bound for Glory, Flair&#x27;s stable&#x27;s name was tweaked to Fortune to represent the expansion in the number of members in the group. On the October 7 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Flair was defeated by Mick Foley in a Last Man Standing match.

====Immortal and second retirement (2010–2012)====

On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Fortune formed an alliance with Hulk Hogan&#x27;s and Eric Bischoff&#x27;s new stable, Immortal. On the November 18 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Flair returned to the ring, competing in a match where he faced Matt Morgan, who had been kicked out of Fortune the previous month; Morgan won the match after Douglas Williams turned on the rest of Fortune, when they interfered in the match. On January 25, 2011, it was reported that Flair had pulled out of TNA&#x27;s &quot;Maximum Wooo!&quot; tour of Europe mid–tour after monetary disputes. After missing a show in Berlin, Germany, Flair returned to the tour on January 27 in Glasgow, Scotland, reportedly apologizing to the locker room prior to the show. On January 29, Flair wrestled his only match of the tour, defeating Douglas Williams in London, tearing his rotator cuff in the process making it his last singles win. During Flair&#x27;s time away from TNA, Fortune turned on Immortal. Flair returned at the February 14 tapings of the February 17 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, turning on Fortune during a match between A.J. Styles and Matt Hardy and jumping to Immortal. On the March 10 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Flair defeated Styles and Hardy in a three–way street fight, contested as more of a two–on–one handicap match. On April 17 at Lockdown, Immortal, represented by Flair, Abyss, Bully Ray and Matt Hardy, was defeated by Fortune members James Storm, Kazarian and Robert Roode and Christopher Daniels, who replaced an injured A.J. Styles, in a Lethal Lockdown match, when Flair tapped out to Roode. The match was used to write Flair off television, as the following week he was scheduled to undergo surgery for his torn rotator cuff; however, Flair ultimately chose not to have the surgery as it would have required six months of rehab.

Flair returned to television in a non–wrestling role on the May 12, 2011 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;. Flair did not appear again for three months, until making his return on August 9 at the tapings of the August 18 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, confronting old rival Sting and challenging him to one more match. In exchange for Sting agreeing to put his career on the line, Flair promised to deliver him his match with Hogan if he was victorious. The match, which Flair lost, took place on the September 15 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;. The match with Sting would be the last of his career to date. During the match, Flair tore his left triceps on a superplex spot, sidelining him indefinitely from in-ring action. At Bound for Glory, Flair appeared in Hogan&#x27;s corner in his match against Sting. Flair continued to make appearances for TNA until April 2012. In April 2012, Flair tried to have his TNA contract terminated, which led to TNA filing a lawsuit against WWE for contract tampering and eventually firing Flair on May 11. Having been inactive since his September 2011 injury, Flair announced in a December 3, 2012 interview that he would never wrestle again, owing chiefly to an on-air heart attack suffered by age peer Jerry Lawler following a &quot;Raw&quot; match three months earlier.

=== Return to WWE (2012–2021) ===
On March 31, 2012, while still contracted to TNA as a part of a deal with WWE which allowed Christian Cage to appear at Slammiversary 10, Flair became the first person to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame twice, the second time as part of the class of 2012 with The Four Horsemen. On December 17, 2012, Flair returned to WWE as a non-wrestling personality on the annual Slammy Awards show to present the Superstar of the Year award to John Cena, who in turn gave the award to Flair. Flair&#x27;s return was interrupted by CM Punk and Paul Heyman, escalating into a confrontation that ended with him locking Heyman in the figure-four leglock. After clearing the ring, Flair was assaulted by The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns, and Seth Rollins), until Ryback and Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan) helped Flair fend off the group. Flair appeared on the main roster sporadically throughout 2013, as The Miz&#x27;s mentor. He also occasionally appeared on &quot;NXT&quot; in 2013 and 2014, accompanying his daughter Charlotte to the ring.
Flair appeared on April 28, 2014, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, alongside the reunited Evolution (minus Flair) and The Shield; Flair showed his endorsement for The Shield, Evolution&#x27;s opponents at Extreme Rules, effectively turning his back on his old teammates. At Battleground, John Cena symbolically handed over his World Heavyweight Championship belt to Flair, telling him to &quot;take it&quot; while promoting his match. On the post-SummerSlam &quot;Raw&quot; in August 2015, Flair interrupted Jon Stewart, who had saved Flair&#x27;s 16 world title record by preventing Cena&#x27;s victory the previous night, telling him that the record would be broken eventually and he would rather it be by someone who he respects.

Flair began making more frequent appearances with Charlotte after she won the Divas Championship. In January 2016, Flair and Charlotte began displaying villainous traits, with Flair often getting involved in Charlotte&#x27;s Divas Championship and later WWE Women&#x27;s Championship defenses, thus turning heel for the first time since 2005 in WWE. This lasted until the May 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when Charlotte turned on him. On the November 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair returned to congratulate the new Raw Women&#x27;s Champion Sasha Banks, who had defeated Charlotte to win the title, thus turning face once again. Flair made a surprise appearance during the November 14, 2017 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; to congratulate his daughter Charlotte Flair, who won the SmackDown Women&#x27;s Championship. They shared an emotional moment on the ramp and did his iconic strut.

On the February 25, 2019 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, WWE celebrated Flair&#x27;s 70th birthday and during the closing moments, Flair was attacked by Batista. The actual &quot;attack&quot; was never seen, only Flair being dragged by Batista. At WrestleMania 35, Flair assisted Triple H in defeating Batista, to keep his in-ring career going. Flair appeared on the July 22 &quot;Raw Reunion&quot; episode and raised a toast alongside Triple H, Hulk Hogan, &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin, and various other fellow wrestlers of his era. In June 2020, Flair came back to WWE programming as a heel again, managing Randy Orton for a few weeks until the August 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when Orton performed a punt kick on Flair&#x27;s head. On November 22, 2020, he made an appearance at Survivor Series during The Undertaker&#x27;s retirement ceremony.

On the January 4, 2021 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair started a storyline with Lacey Evans, when during a match against Women&#x27;s Tag Team Champions Charlotte Flair and Asuka, Evans flirted with Flair. During the following weeks, Flair managed Evans, usually distracting his daughter Charlotte, including a participation in the Women&#x27;s Royal Rumble. On the February 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Evans&#x27; real-life pregnancy was announced and incorporated into a storyline with Flair impregnating Lacey. Evans was scheduled to face Asuka for Raw Women&#x27;s Championship at Elimination Chamber but the match was canceled due to her pregnancy and the storyline with Flair was canceled. On August 2, 2021, it was reported by Wrestling Inc. that Flair had asked for and was granted his release from WWE. WWE confirmed his release the following day and considered it effective as of August 3.

=== Late career (2021–present) ===
====&quot;Ric Flair&#x27;s Last Match&quot; (2021–2023)====

On August 14, 2021, at Triplemanía XXIX, Flair made his Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) debut by accompanying Charlotte&#x27;s fiancé Andrade &quot;El Ídolo&quot; to ringside during his match against AAA Mega Champion Kenny Omega. Flair would later get involved in the match by chopping Omega and applying the Figure Four leglock to Omega&#x27;s second Konnan.

On August 29, 2021, Flair made his return to the NWA at NWA 73. It was his first NWA appearance since 2008 when he was inducted into the NWA Hall of Fame. At NWA 73, Flair thanked the NWA and WWE for several memorable moments and noted the importance of having several companies in the industry.

On May 16, 2022, it was announced that Flair would wrestle his final match on July 31 in Nashville, called &quot;Ric Flair&#x27;s Last Match&quot;, finally retiring after nearly five decades in the ring. On July 18, it was announced that Flair would team with his son-in-law Andrade El Ídolo against Jeff Jarrett and Jay Lethal. As part of the promo setting up the match, Lethal attacked Flair over being left out of the match card. Jarrett initially tried to help Flair, but attacked him after he rebuffed him and used expletives against his family. Flair and Andrade would go on to win the match.

Flair later confirmed that he had passed out twice during the Last Match and regretted announcing that it would be his final match. A few days later, he accompanied Andrade during his match against Carlito at the 49th WWC Anniversary show held on August 6, 2022. Flair attempted to interfere before poking Primo Colón when he tried to stop him, causing Carlos Colón to attack him and forcing him to flee. Andrade would go on to lose the match.

During the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of his debut in professional wrestling on September 26, 2022, Flair announced that he would never retire. In January 2023 however he stated that he did not want to wrestle again aside from wanting to redo the Last Match. In January 2024, Flair stated &quot;no return to the ring ever&quot;.

==== All Elite Wrestling (2023–2024) ====

On the October 25, 2023, episode of &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, Flair, in his first appearance on TBS since the March 21, 2001 episode of WCW &quot;Thunder&quot;, appeared as a &quot;gift&quot; from All Elite Wrestling (AEW) founder Tony Khan to Sting for his upcoming retirement. Both men previously wrestled in the final episode of WCW &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; on March 26, 2001. On November 2, 2023, it was announced Flair signed a multi-year deal with AEW. On November 18, 2023, he made his AEW PPV debut at Full Gear, accompanying Sting, Darby Allin and Adam Copeland to the ring, and performing chops and a low blow to Christian Cage. On the January 6, 2024 &quot;AEW Collision&quot; Flair accompanied Sting and Allin to the ring, and later performed a promo with Sting later in the night. On January 10, 2024, Flair once again accompanied Sting and Allin to the ring during their match against Powerhouse Hobbs and Konosuke Takeshita, in which he once again delivered chops, this time inside an AEW ring for the first time. On February 21, Flair would once again appear on &quot;Dynamite&quot; claiming he was unhappy with his involvement with Sting&#x27;s retirement, and wanted to play a bigger role, he then entered The Young Bucks office. The following week on February 28, during Sting&#x27;s final Dynamite appearance, he made his iconic entrance from the rafters, with Flair delivering punches and chops to The Young Bucks. On March 3, 2024, Flair accompanied Sting and Allin to the ring at the Revolution pay-per-view, in the Greensboro Coliseum, the same venue in which the pair faced each other for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Clash of the Champions I in March 1988. During the match Flair received superkicks from The Young Bucks. On July 12, 2024, it was reported by Dave Meltzer in the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; that Flair had parted ways with AEW.

== Legacy ==
Flair was often popular with the crowd due to his in-ring antics, including rulebreaking (earning him the distinction of being &quot;the dirtiest player in the game&quot;), strutting and his shouting of &quot;Woooooooo!&quot; (Flair got the inspiration from Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27; &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;). The &quot;Wooo!&quot; yell has since become a tribute to Flair, and is often shouted by the crowd whenever a wrestler performs a knife-edge chop, one of Flair&#x27;s signature moves. It is also often shouted by the crowd whenever a wrestler utilizes Flair&#x27;s figure-four leglock finisher.One of Professional Wrestling&#x27;s biggest draws, Hulk Hogan, has said he himself is &quot;number two&quot; behind Ric Flair, who is the greatest wrestler of all time.

From the late-1970s, Flair wore ornate fur-lined robes of many colors with sequins during in-ring appearances, and since the early 1980s, his approach to the ring was usually heralded by the playing of the &quot;Dawn&quot; section of Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot; (famous for being used in the 1968 motion picture &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and for the introduction to Elvis Presley&#x27;s concerts of the 1970s). Flair also described himself as a &quot;limousine-ridin&#x27;, jet-flyin&#x27;, kiss stealin&#x27;, wheelin&#x27; dealin&#x27;, son-of-a-gun (who kissed all the girls worldwide and made em cry)&quot;.

On April 29, 1995, Ric Flair fought Antonio Inoki in the main event match of Collision in Korea Day 2. The event registered an attendance of 165,000 people, the largest crowd in professional wrestling history.

On October 19, 1998, it was declared &quot;Ric Flair Day&quot; in Minneapolis, Minnesota by Mayor Sharon Belton and on November 15, 2008, it was declared &quot;Ric Flair Day&quot; in Norfolk, Virginia. On March 24, 2008, Mayor Bob Coble, of Columbia, South Carolina, declared March 24 to be Ric Flair Day in Columbia. Flair also received the key to the city. He received the key to the city of Greensboro, North Carolina on December 5, 2008, to commemorate Flair&#x27;s victory in a steel cage match against Harley Race at the inaugural Starrcade event. April 18, 2009 was declared &quot;Ric Flair Day&quot; in Charleston, West Virginia and he was presented with the key to the city by the mayor. Also, on June 12, 2009, Flair was presented with the key to the city of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and, in September, he received the key to the city in Marion County, South Carolina. On July 17, 2010, Flair made a special appearance at Scotland Motors in Laurinburg, North Carolina and received the key to that city, as well.

On the February 18, 2008 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Shawn Michaels announced Flair as the first inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2008. The induction ceremony took place on March 29, 2008, with Triple H inducting him. This made him the first person to be inducted while still an active competitor. Flair was later inducted into the NWA Hall of Fame in Atlanta, Georgia, but he did not participate in the event. On January 9, 2012, it was announced that the Four Horsemen would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, thus making Flair the first person to have been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice.

On April 15, 2008, Flair was honored in Congress by a representative from North Carolina, Republican Sue Myrick, who praised his career and what he means to the state. On September 29, 2008, it was announced that Flair&#x27;s signature sequin covered robe that he wore at WrestleMania XXIV, in what was to be his last WWE match, would be placed in the pop culture section of the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.

In 1999, a large group of professional wrestling experts, analysts and historians named Flair the greatest NWA World Heavyweight Champion of all time. In 2002, Flair was named the greatest professional wrestler of all time in the book &quot;The Top 100 Wrestlers of All Time&quot; by John Molinaro, edited by Dave Meltzer and Jeff Marek. in July 2016, Luke Winkie of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; also named Flair the greatest professional wrestler of all time.

Flair&#x27;s &quot;Wooo&quot; chant has been used throughout pop culture. Rapper Pusha T paid homage to Flair in numerous songs. For example, on the track &quot;Sweet Serenade&quot;, he says, &quot;Triple doubles, two hoes and check please (Wooo!), They love me on my Ric Flair shit (Wooo!), In that Phantom like I&#x27;m Blair Witch (Wooo!), Who are you to be compared with? (Wooo!)&quot;. Atlanta-based rapper Killer Mike also has a track named &quot;Ric Flair&quot;. American trap musicians Offset and Metro Boomin paid tribute to Flair in their hit song &quot;Ric Flair Drip&quot;. The Battle of Gettysburg Podcast, hosted by battlefield guides and wrestling fans Jim Hessler and Eric Lindblade, often cites Flair&#x27;s &quot;Wooo&quot; chant as well as other elements of Flair&#x27;s mystique.

=== Reaction to later career ===
Some have looked unfavorably upon Flair&#x27;s career from the late-1990s onward. In 1998, wrestler and former WCW colleague Stone Cold Steve Austin said that Flair had reached the &quot;time to hang it up&quot;, having not been great for a &quot;long time&quot;. John Molinaro of Slam! Sports penned a 1999 article titled, &quot;Ric Flair is tarnishing his legacy&quot;; Molinaro saw Flair as a wrestler whose prestige was &quot;in jeopardy&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; writer Frank Ingiosi said that Flair had a &quot;personal vendetta against his legend&quot;. He nevertheless continued to wrestle until originally retiring in 2008, at age 59.

Despite the unfavorable reviews for continuing to wrestle, many of his later career matches were praised. The match between Flair and Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania 24 in 2008 was named as the &quot;match of the decade&quot; by popular professional wrestling magazine &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot;.

Flair would ultimately return to the ring in 2009 and signed to wrestle for TNA the following year, breaking a vow to never again lace up his boots. Wrestler Axl Rotten, NFL writer Adam Rank, and many fans felt that he sullied his legend by continuing to wrestle in TNA. Asked in 2011 if Flair was tainting his prestige, former opponent Shane Douglas was harsher, stating that he had &quot;been tarnishing his legacy since 1990&quot;. Also that year, Kevin Eck of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; criticized the aging Flair for being unable to separate himself from his ostentatious gimmick when not wrestling, and said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s sadder, Ric Flair tarnishing his legacy in the ring or embarrassing himself away from the ring&quot;. Asked about Flair in 2015, wrestler The Honky Tonk Man felt that viewers would &quot;remember only the last years of his career&quot;, which consist of &quot;bad memories&quot;.

Conversely, professional wrestling announcer Jim Ross in 2012 felt that Flair had not tarnished his legacy, observing only &quot;passion and need to earn a living&quot;. In 2016, Flair said continuing to wrestle in TNA was the &quot;number one&quot; regret of his career.

== Other media ==

Flair has made numerous appearances in television shows. In 1996, Flair, along with other WCW wrestlers, appeared in an episode of &quot;Baywatch&quot; as themselves. In 2013, Flair made an appearance in &quot;Stuff You Should Know&quot;, in the episode, &quot;Bacteriopolis&quot;, as Dr. Roland Grayson. In 2014, Flair voiced himself in the animated series, &quot;Uncle Grandpa&quot;, in the episode, &quot;History of Wrestling&quot;. In 2011, Flair voiced himself in the animated series, &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, in the episode, &quot;BFFs&quot;.

Flair released his autobiography, &quot;To Be the Man&quot;, on June 29, 2004. The title is taken from one of his catchphrases, &quot;To be the man, you gotta beat the man!&quot;.

In 2009, Flair voiced Commander Douglas Hill in the video game &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 - Uprising&quot;.

It was announced on July 8, 2012, that Flair was to appear at Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s 13th Annual Gathering of the Juggalos weekend as a main stage host who was in charge of announcing the performers. However, his appearance at the event was cut short after his head was barely struck by a water bottle thrown from the crowd before announcing Tech N9ne to enter the main stage. Flair at that point left immediately after announcing Tech N9ne and did not go back out on the main stage to announce the remaining performers. Flair&#x27;s final comment before he left the main stage was &quot;Have fun&quot;.

In 2015, Flair made his feature film debut, appearing in &quot;Magic Mike XXL&quot;. From May 2015-April 2016, Flair was host of a podcast titled &quot;WOOOOO! Nation&quot;. The podcast was placed on hiatus after episode 46 which was uploaded on April 1, 2016. Flair returned to podcasting on MLW Radio with a new show called &quot;The Ric Flair Show&quot; in July 2016. The final episode of &quot;The Ric Flair Show&quot; was uploaded on December 16, 2016. Flair stated that the reason that he had quit the podcasting business was because he could no longer be objective when it comes to his opinion of what is happening in the WWE.

In 2017, ESPN aired &quot;Nature Boy&quot;, a &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary about Flair&#x27;s career directed by Rory Karpf.

On October 31, 2017, trap artists Offset and Metro Boomin released a single titled &quot;Ric Flair Drip&quot; from their collaborative album with 21 Savage, &quot;Without Warning&quot;, in which Flair made an appearance in the music video. In December 2017, Latin trap artist Bad Bunny released a music video entitled &quot;Chambea&quot;, in which Flair appeared.

Flair signed an endorsement deal with online ticket exchange marketplace TickPick in August 2018. Under the agreement he would make guest posts on TickPick&#x27;s blog, in addition to appearing in advertisements for the brand posted on its and his own social media channels.

Flair started appearing in an advertising campaign for CarShield in April 2021 (One of the commercials featured him alongside LA Knight, who played the role of &quot;The Overcharger&quot;). The company paused it in September 2021 following allegations of sexual assault made by Heidi Doyle against Flair on an episode of &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot;. It however resumed airing the commercials in December 2021.

In November 2021, Flair brought back his podcast &quot;WOOOOO! Nation&quot;. It was named &quot;Wooooo Nation Uncensored&quot; and was co-hosted by Mark Madden. Madden quit in March 2022. He was replaced by Flair&#x27;s son-in-law Conrad Thompson and the podcast was revamped into &quot;To Be the Man&quot; in April 2022.

Flair signed an endorsement deal with Nu Image Medical, an online telehealth and medical company, in June 2022 to promote its men&#x27;s health products. WWE and the streaming service Peacock partnered to release a documentary on Flair titled &quot;Woooooo! Becoming Ric Flair&quot; on December 26.

==Business ventures==
Flair sells his official merchandise through his own website.

He partnered with Scout Comics in 2021 to launch a comic book series named &quot;Code Name: Ric Flair&quot;. Following allegations of sexual assault against him made on &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot;, Scout Comics dropped the comic and Flair started personally selling it on his website. However, later in December 2022, the company agreed to publish it through its label. It was written by Scout Comics President James Haick III and was released in April 2023.

In July 2022, Flair launched a virtual restaurant chain named &quot;Wooooo! Wings&quot; in Nashville, Tennessee in partnership with Kitchen Data Systems ahead of &quot;Ric Flair&#x27;s Last Match&quot;. The name of the chain is based after Flair&#x27;s signature exclamation. The food items of the outlet are prepared by KitchPartner restaurants, owned by Kitchen Data Systems. The chain expanded to six American cities in August 2022. Its launch and expansion was handled by Conrad Thompson.

Flair also partnered with Mike Tyson and Verano Holdings Corp. to launch his own cannabis line called the &quot;Ric Flair Drip&quot; under Tyson&#x27;s cannabis brand &quot;Tyson 2.0&quot;. The line launched in October 2022 in Arizona, Nevada and California.

In July 2023, Flair partnered with Carma HoldCo and LGNDS to release a mushroom-infused energy drink called &quot;Wooooo! Energy&quot;.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===
Flair married his first wife, Leslie Goodman, on August 28, 1971. They had two children, daughter Megan and son David, before divorcing in 1983 after twelve years of marriage. On August 27, 1983, he married his second wife, Elizabeth Harrell. Promoter Jim Crockett Jr. served as the best man for the wedding. They had two children, daughter Ashley and son Reid. Beth and their children also made periodic appearances in WCW between 1998 and 2000. Flair and Beth divorced in 2006 after nearly 23 years of marriage. On May 27, 2006, Flair married his third wife Tiffany VanDemark, a fitness competitor. In 2008, Tiffany filed for divorce from Flair, which was finalized in 2009. On November 11, 2009, Flair married his fourth wife, Jacqueline &quot;Jackie&quot; Beems, in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 2012, Flair filed for divorce from Beems, which was finalized in 2014. Flair, in a non-legally binding wedding ceremony, married Wendy Barlow (known as Fifi, his &quot;maid&quot; in WCW), on September 12, 2018, at a resort in Florida. Despite having a wedding ceremony, Flair and Barlow later revealed to &quot;People&quot; in January 2022 that they were never legally married, as they never applied for a marriage certificate. On January 31, 2022, Flair announced that he and Barlow had separated. The two reconciled in May 2022, but separated again in September 2024.

Flair&#x27;s elder son David is a retired professional wrestler, who worked for WCW from 1999 to 2001, and made two televised appearances in the WWF in 2002 during the run-up to WrestleMania X8. Flair&#x27;s younger son Reid, who signed a developmental contract with WWE near the end of 2007, was an accomplished high school wrestler and made several appearances on WCW television along with his sister Ashley and half-sister Megan. In 2004, Flair became a grandfather at the age of 55, when his older daughter, Megan Fliehr Ketzner, gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Morgan Lee Ketzner on May 9.

On May 17, 2012, it was reported that Flair&#x27;s daughter Ashley had signed with WWE adopting the ring name, Charlotte, which was later changed to include the Flair surname.

On March 29, 2013, Reid died from a drug overdose of heroin, Xanax, and a muscle relaxant.

On October 26, 2024, Sebastian Kidder, Flair&#x27;s stepson through his relationship with Barlow, died from a gunshot wound, committing suicide.

=== Legal problems ===
In December 2005, a judge issued arrest warrants for Flair after a road rage incident that took place in Charlotte, North Carolina, in which Flair allegedly got out of his car, grabbed a motorist by the neck, and damaged his vehicle. Flair was charged with two misdemeanors, injury to personal property and simple assault and battery. This incident was ridiculed on WWE programming, most notably by the wrestler Edge.

In September 2007, Flair opened a financial business called Ric Flair Finance. In July 2008, Flair Finance filed for bankruptcy. Following Flair&#x27;s debut in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling his former employer, Ring of Honor, filed a lawsuit in 2010, alleging that Flair owed them over $40,000 and that he had not appeared at several events that he was contractually obligated to appear at. The lawsuit was never resolved.

Highspots Inc. claimed that Flair had given them the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt as collateral for the loan. A warrant for Flair&#x27;s arrest was issued in May 2011 for being held in contempt of court for violating the terms of his settlement with Highspots. If Flair had failed to comply he could have potentially faced 90 days in jail. On June 25, Highspots released a statement over their official Facebook page stating that someone had paid Flair&#x27;s debts.

=== Politics ===
Flair has long supported Republican political candidates in North Carolina politics. In 2000, Flair explored the possibility of running for governor of North Carolina, but he never filed the papers. Jesse Ventura stated that, when Flair told him that he had received 143 speeding tickets in his life, Ventura urged him not to run.

In the 2008 presidential election, Flair declared his support for the Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. He said of Huckabee, &quot;[Huckabee] is a quality person, self-made, a great family man and he has a great vision for our country. And I&#x27;m here to excite the crowd.&quot;

Flair endorsed Ted Cruz during the 2016 presidential election.

Flair announced in 2016 that he was running for president, with rapper Waka Flocka Flame as his running mate. However, he did not file a Statement of Candidacy (FEC Form 2).

===Health issues===
Flair has a heart condition called alcoholic cardiomyopathy.

On August 14, 2017, Flair had surgery in Georgia to remove an obstructive piece of his bowel, which led to various complications, most seriously kidney failure, necessitating dialysis treatment and ongoing hospitalization. He was discharged from rehabilitation and allowed to return home on September 21.

Flair suffered a heart attack during his final match on July 31, 2022.

== Real-life feuds and backstage problems ==
===Teddy Long===
WWE Hall of Famer Teddy Long claimed Flair was hostile to him in his early career in the 1980s, stating &quot;Flair walked up to me one time and asked me, he said, &#x27;Nigger you like working here?&quot;. Long claims Flair never apologized to him and &quot;hasn&#x27;t changed over the years&quot;.

=== Bret Hart ===
Flair engaged in an off-screen rivalry with Bret Hart. In October 1993, Hart gave a radio interview in which he said Flair &quot;sucks&quot; and described his workplace, WCW, as &quot;minor league&quot;. Flair, in his autobiography, accused Hart of exploiting the death of his brother Owen and the controversy surrounding the Montreal Screwjob. Flair also claimed in his autobiography that—despite Hart&#x27;s popularity in Canada—he was not a formidable money-making draw in the United States, a claim which Hart dismissed as &quot;plain ridiculous&quot; in a column written for the &quot;Calgary Sun&quot;. Hart cited his headlining performances on consistently sold-out tours throughout his WWF career, while alleging that Flair wrestled to near-empty arenas. He also criticized Flair on what he perceived as insults to fellow wrestlers Mick Foley and Randy Savage, both personal friends of Hart. Hart went on to criticize Flair in his own autobiography, mainly his in-ring talent, (mis)use of ring psychology and what Hart perceived as Flair&#x27;s unsubtle blading. However, they have since reconciled and are now friends.

=== Shane Douglas ===
Flair also had a long-running feud with Shane Douglas, who would refer to him as &quot;Dick Flair&quot; and accuse him of sabotaging his push in the NWA/WCW after getting a solid push and a rub from his tag team partner Ricky Steamboat. In turn, Flair responded that Douglas was always the guy that would blame his shortcomings on others. He called Douglas out as well as accused him of steroid abuse during a broadcast of the Internet radio show &quot;WCW Live!&quot; in which he said that he would meet him anytime and anywhere if he would &quot;take the needle out of his ass&quot;.

=== Mick Foley ===
Flair has also had problems with Mick Foley. In his 1999 autobiography &quot;Have a Nice Day!&quot;, Foley said that &quot;Flair was every bit as bad on the booking side of things as he was great on the wrestling side of it&quot;. This was in reference to how poorly Foley thought he was booked during his WCW career when Flair was on the booking committee. Flair responded in his autobiography by writing: &quot;I do not care how many thumbtacks Mick Foley has fallen on, how many ladders he&#x27;s fallen off, how many continents he&#x27;s supposedly bled on, he will always be known as a glorified stuntman&quot;. They had an altercation in 2004 in Huntsville, and in 2006 they worked a program where Flair took part in some of the bloodiest and most violent matches of his career, particularly at SummerSlam 2006, in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match which had spots involving barbed wire and thumbtacks—trademark weapons from Foley&#x27;s days as Cactus Jack. However, they have since reconciled and are now friends.

=== Hulk Hogan ===
In his book, Flair also touched on some real-life tension between himself and Hulk Hogan which largely stemmed from an incident that followed the conclusion of a tag team match between Flair and his son David and the team of Curt Hennig and Barry Windham at WCW&#x27;s Souled Out pay-per-view on January 17, 1999, in Charleston, West Virginia. However, Flair has stated that he and Hogan remained friends despite their differences.

=== Bruno Sammartino ===
Flair and wrestler Bruno Sammartino had a real-life disagreement over what reports call &quot;the infamous backstage snub&quot; where Flair claims that Sammartino refused to shake his hand at a live event. While Flair claims Sammartino ignored him due to comments made in his book, stating Sammartino was &quot;a Northeast star who couldn&#x27;t draw fans outside New York&quot;, Sammartino referred to Flair as a &quot;liar&quot; and stating: &quot;No, I don&#x27;t respect Ric Flair. I don&#x27;t respect him at all&quot;. They reconciled and were friends until Sammartino&#x27;s death in 2018.

===Becky Lynch===
In September 2019, Flair threatened legal action against WWE and filed a trademark for the term &quot;The Man&quot;, which was being used as a nickname by heavily promoted wrestler Becky Lynch. The threats of legal action caused a rift between Flair and his daughter Charlotte, who was Lynch&#x27;s onscreen nemesis at the time. Lynch responded to the actions by asserting that she still liked and respected Flair. Flair transferred the rights to &quot;The Man&quot; nickname and gimmick to WWE in May 2020. The terms of the transfer were undisclosed. Flair began feuding with Lynch in 2021, accusing her of using the term without his explicit permission, but their dispute was resolved when he apologized to her in January 2023.

===&quot;Plane Ride from Hell&quot;===
Flair was part of the infamous 2002 &quot;Plane Ride from Hell&quot;. Flair was accused of wearing his signature wrestling robe while naked and forcing two female flight attendants to touch his penis; they would later sue the WWE, though the case was ultimately settled out of court. The allegations were discussed on the Canadian documentary series &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot; in 2021 on an episode dedicated to the flight. Flair released a statement after the episode aired denying the allegations. Flair was also removed from the WWE&#x27;s intro signature afterwards.

<text>The Downtown Eastside (DTES) is a neighbourhood in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. One of the city&#x27;s oldest neighbourhoods, the DTES is the site of a complex set of social issues, including disproportionately high levels of drug use, homelessness, poverty, crime, mental illness and sex work. It is also known for its strong community resilience, history of social activism, and artistic contributions.

Around the beginning of the 20th century, the DTES was Vancouver&#x27;s political, cultural and retail centre. Over several decades, the city centre gradually shifted westwards, and the DTES became a poor neighbourhood, although relatively stable. In the 1980s, the area began a rapid decline due to several factors, including an influx of hard drugs, policies that pushed sex work and drug-related activity out of nearby areas, and the cessation of federal funding for social housing. By 1997, an epidemic of HIV infection and drug overdoses in the DTES led to the declaration of a public health emergency. As of 2018, critical issues include opioid overdoses, especially those involving the drug fentanyl; decrepit and squalid housing; a shortage of low-cost rental housing; and mental illness, which often co-occurs with addiction.

The population of the DTES is estimated to be around 7,000 people. Compared to the city, the DTES has a higher proportion of males and adults who live alone. It also has significantly more Indigenous Canadians, disproportionately affected by the neighbourhood&#x27;s social problems. The neighbourhood has a history of attracting individuals with mental health and addiction issues, many of whom are drawn to its drug market and low-barrier services. Residents experience Canada&#x27;s highest rate of death from encounters with police, and there is mutual mistrust between police and many homeless residents.

Since Vancouver&#x27;s real-estate boom began in the early 21st century, the area has been increasingly experiencing gentrification. Some see gentrification as a force for revitalization, while others believe it has led to higher displacement and homelessness. Numerous efforts have been made to improve the DTES at an estimated cost of over $1.4 billion as of 2009. Services in the greater DTES area are estimated to cost $360 million per year. Commentators from across the political spectrum have said that little progress has been made in resolving the issues of the neighbourhood as a whole, although there are individual success stories. Proposals for addressing the issues of the area include increasing investment in social housing, increasing capacity for treating people with addictions and mental illness, making services more evenly distributed across the city and region instead of concentrated in the DTES, and improving coordination of services. However, little agreement exists between the municipal, provincial and federal governments regarding long-term plans for the area.

==Geography==
The term &quot;Downtown Eastside&quot; is most often used to refer to an area 10 to 50 blocks in size, a few blocks east of the city&#x27;s Downtown central business district. The neighbourhood is centred around the intersection of Main Street and Hastings Street, where residents have gathered for over a hundred years to connect. This intersection is also the home of the Carnegie Community Centre. The area around Hastings and Main is where the neighbourhood&#x27;s social issues are most visible, described in the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; in 2006 as &quot;four blocks of hell.&quot;

Some indications of the borders of the DTES, which shift and are poorly defined, are as follows:
* A 2016 analysis of crime in the DTES by &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot; focused on an area that consisted of a six-block length of Hastings and Cordova Streets, between Cambie Street and Jackson Avenue.
* The City of Vancouver describes a &quot;Community-based Development Area&quot;, where places important to low-income residents are concentrated. This area includes Hastings Street from Abbott Street to Heatley Avenue, and the blocks surrounding Oppenheimer Park.
* By some definitions, the DTES extends along Main Street to beyond Terminal Avenue, and the DTES also includes a strip of land adjacent to Vancouver&#x27;s port.

For some community planning and statistical purposes, the City of Vancouver uses the term &quot;Downtown Eastside&quot; to refer to a much larger area with considerable social and economic diversity, including Chinatown, Gastown, Strathcona, the Victory Square area, and the light industrial area to the north. This area, referred to in this article as the greater DTES area, is bordered by Richards Street to the west, Clark Drive to the east, Waterfront Road and Water Street to the north and various streets to the south including Malkin Avenue and Prior Street. The greater DTES area includes some popular tourist areas and nearly 20% of Vancouver&#x27;s heritage buildings. 

Strathcona in the 1890s included the entire DTES. By 1994 Strathcona&#x27;s northern boundary was generally considered to be the alley between East Pender and East Hastings streets, though some place it at Railway Street, including DTES east of Gore Avenue.

==History==

The DTES forms part of the traditional territories of the Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh, and Musqueam First Nations. European settlement of the area began in the mid-19th century, and most early buildings were destroyed in the Great Vancouver Fire of 1886. Residents rebuilt their town at the edge of Burrard Inlet, between Cambie and Carrall streets, a townsite that now forms Gastown and part of the DTES. At the turn of the century, the DTES was the heart of the city, containing city hall, the courthouse, banks, the main shopping district, and the Carnegie Library. Travellers connecting between Pacific steamships and the western terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway used its hundreds of hotels and rooming houses. Large Japanese and Chinese immigrant communities settled in Japantown, which lies within the DTES, and in nearby Chinatown, respectively.

During the Depression, hundreds of men arrived in Vancouver searching for work. Most of them later returned to their hometowns, except workers who had been injured or those who were sick or elderly. These men remained in the DTES area – at the time known as Skid Road – which became a non-judgemental, affordable place to live as the main downtown area of Vancouver began to shift westward. Among them, drinking was a common pastime. In addition to being a central cultural and entertainment district, Hastings Street was also a centre for beer parlours and brothels.

In 1942, the neighbourhood lost its entire ethnic Japanese population, estimated at 8,000 to 10,000, due to the Canadian government&#x27;s internment of these people. After the war, most did not return to the once-thriving Japantown community.

In the 1950s, the city centre continued its shift westward after the interurban rail line closed; its main depot was at Carrall and Hastings. Theatres and shops moved towards Granville and Robson streets. As tourist traffic declined, the neighbourhood&#x27;s hotels became run-down and were gradually converted to single room occupancy (SRO) housing, a use which persists to this day. By 1965, the area was known for prostitution and for having a relatively high proportion of poor, single men, many of whom were alcoholics, disabled, or pensioners.

===1980s===
In the early 1980s, the DTES was an edgy but still relatively calm place to live. The neighbourhood began a marked shift before Expo 86, when an estimated 800 to 1,000 tenants were evicted from DTES residential hotels to make room for tourists. With the increased tourist traffic of Expo 86, dealers introduced an influx of high-purity cocaine and heroin. In efforts to clean up other areas of the city, police cracked down on the cocaine market and street prostitution, but these activities resurfaced in the DTES. Within the DTES, police officers gave up on arresting the huge numbers of individual drug users, and chose to focus their efforts on dealers instead.

Meanwhile, the provincial government adopted a policy of de-institutionalization of the mentally ill, leading to the mass discharge of Riverview Hospital&#x27;s patients, with the promise that they would be integrated into the community. Between 1985 and 1999, the number of patient-days of care provided by B.C. psychiatric hospitals declined by nearly 65%. Many of the de-institutionalized mentally ill moved to the DTES, attracted by the accepting culture and low-cost housing, but they floundered without adequate treatment and support and soon became addicted to the neighbourhood&#x27;s readily available drugs.

Between 1980 and 2002, more than 60 women went missing from the DTES, most of them sex workers. A large number are missing and murdered Indigenous women. Robert Pickton, who had a farm east of the city where he held &quot;raves&quot;, was charged with the murders of 26 of these women and convicted on six counts in 2007. He claimed to have murdered 49 women. As of 2009, an estimated 39 women were still missing from the Downtown Eastside.

===1990s to present===


In the 1990s, the situation in the DTES deteriorated further on several fronts. Woodward&#x27;s, an anchor store in the 100-block of West Hastings street, closed in 1993 with devastating effect on the formerly bustling retail district. Meanwhile, a crisis in housing and homelessness was emerging.

Between 1970 and the late 1990s, the supply of low-income housing shrank in both the DTES and in other parts of the city, partly because of the conversion of buildings into more expensive condominiums or hotels. In 1993, the federal government stopped funding social housing, and the rate of building social housing in B.C. dropped by two-thirds despite rising demand for it. By 1995, reports had begun to emerge of homeless people sleeping in parks, alleyways, and abandoned buildings. Cuts to the provincial welfare program in 2002 caused further hardship for the poor and homeless. Citywide, homeless people climbed from 630 in 2002 to 1,300 in 2005.

Without a viable retail economy, a drug economy proliferated, with an accompanying increase in crime, while police presence decreased. Crack cocaine arrived in Vancouver in 1995, and crystal methamphetamine started to appear in the DTES in 2003. In 1997 the local health authority declared a public health emergency in the DTES: Rates of HIV infection, spread by needle-sharing amongst drug users, were worse than anywhere in the world outside Sub-Saharan Africa, and more than 1000 people had died of drug overdoses. Efforts to reduce drug-related deaths in the DTES included the opening of a needle exchange in 1989, the opening of North America&#x27;s first legal safe injection site in 2003, and treatment with anti-retroviral drugs for HIV. A shift among users from injected cocaine to crack cocaine use may have also slowed the spread of disease. Rates of HIV infection dropped from 8.1 cases per 100 person-years in 1997 to 0.37 cases per 100 person-years by 2011.

In the 21st century, considerable investment was made in DTES services and infrastructure, including the Woodward&#x27;s Building redevelopment and the acquisition of 23 SRO hotels by the provincial government for conversion to social housing. In 2009, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; estimated that governments and the private sector had spent more than $1.4 billion since 2000 on projects aimed at resolving the area&#x27;s many problems.

Opinions vary on whether the area has improved: A 2014 article in the &quot;National Post&quot; said, &quot;For all the money and attention here, there is little success at either getting the area&#x27;s shattered populace back on their feet or cleaning up the neighbourhood into something resembling a healthy community.&quot; Former NDP premier Mike Harcourt described the current reality of the neighbourhood as &quot;100-per-cent failure.&quot; Also in 2014, B.C. housing minister Rich Coleman claimed &quot;I&#x27;ll go down for a walk in the Downtown Eastside, night time or day time, and it&#x27;s dramatically different than it was. It&#x27;s incredibly better than it was five, six years ago.&quot;

==Demographics==

There are no official population figures for the DTES. Estimates have ranged from 6,000 to 8,000; the geographic boundaries associated with these figures were not provided.

Official figures are available for the greater DTES area, which was home to an estimated 18,477 people in 2011. In comparison to the city of Vancouver overall, the greater DTES had a higher proportion of males (60% vs. 50%), more seniors (22% vs 13%), fewer children and youth (10% vs 18%), slightly fewer immigrants, and more Indigenous Canadians (10% vs. 2%).

A 2009 demographic profile by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; focused on an area of just over 30 city blocks in and around the DTES: It indicated that 14% of the residents were of Indigenous descent. The average household size was 1.3 residents; 82% of the population lived alone. Children and teenagers made up 7% of the people, compared to 25% of Canada overall.

A population that is frequently studied is tenants of single-room occupancy (SRO) hotels in the greater DTES area. According to a 2013 survey, this population is 77% male, with a median age of 44. Indigenous people make up 28% of the population, and Europeans 59%.

=== Migration patterns ===
The DTES has a history of attracting migrants with mental health and addiction issues across B.C. and Canada, with many drawn by its drug market, affordable housing, and services. Between 1991 and 2007, the DTES population increased by 140%.

A 2016 study found that 52% of those DTES residents who experience chronic homelessness and serious mental health issues had migrated from outside Vancouver in the previous 10 years. This proportion of the population has tripled in the last decade. The same study found that once migrants had settled in the DTES, their conditions worsened. A 2013 study of tenants of DTES SROs found that while 93% of those surveyed were born in Canada, only 13% were born in Vancouver. Vancouver Coastal Health estimates that half of the population that uses its health services in the DTES are long-term residents and that there is a population turnover of 15 to 20% each year.

==Culture==

Although many outsiders fear the DTES, its residents take pride in their neighbourhood and describe it as having multiple positive assets. DTES residents say the area has a strong sense of community and cultural heritage. They describe their neighbours as accepting and empathizing with people with addictions and health issues. According to the city government, Hastings Street is valued by SRO residents as &quot;a place to meet friends, get support, access services and feel like they belong.&quot;

The area has had a robust tradition of advocacy for its marginalized residents since at least the 1970s when the Downtown Eastside Residents Association (DERA) was formed. Over the years, the DTES community has consistently resisted many attempts to &quot;clean up&quot; the neighbourhood by dispersing its close-knit residents. Successful resident-led initiatives to improve conditions in the DTES include the transformation of the then-closed Carnegie Library into a community centre in 1980, the opening of an unlicensed supervised injection site in 2003, which led to the founding of Insite; improvements to Oppenheimer Park, and the creation of CRAB Park.

In 2010, the V6A postal area, which includes most of the DTES, had the second-highest concentration of artists in the city. Artists made up 4.4% of the labour force, compared to 2.3% in the city as a whole. The Downtown Eastside Artists&#x27; Collective was formed by Trey Helten, manager of the Overdose Prevention Society. The greater DTES area is the location of several art galleries, artist-run centres and studios. Prominent local artists include poet Henry Doyle, artist Marcel Mousseau, and poet Bud Osborn.

Notable annual events include the &quot;Downtown Eastside Heart of the City Festival&quot;, which showcases the art, culture, and history of the neighbourhood, and the &quot;Powell Street Festival&quot; in Oppenheimer Park, which celebrates Japanese-Canadian arts and culture. The Smilin&#x27; Buddha Cabaret operated at 109 East Hastings Street from 1952 to the late 1980s as a symbol of &quot;cultural vitality,&quot; reflecting shifts in the neighbourhood itself. City Opera of Vancouver, the Dancing on the Edge Festival, and other artists regularly perform in DTES venues such as the Carnegie Centre, the Firehall Arts Centre, and the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts at the Woodward&#x27;s site. The musical composition &quot;100 Block Rock,&quot; featuring 11 tracks, was released in 2020. In 2010, Sam Sullivan, former mayor of Vancouver, said that in the DTES, &quot;Behind the visible people who have a lot of troubles, there&#x27;s a community. Some very intelligent people say this is the city&#x27;s cultural heart.&quot;

== Current issues ==
===Addiction and mental illness===
The DTES population suffers very high rates of mental illness and addiction. In 2007, Vancouver Coastal Health estimated that 2,100 DTES residents &quot;exhibit behaviour that is outside the norm&quot; and require more support in the areas of health and addiction services. According to the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) in 2008, up to 500 of these individuals were &quot;chronically mentally ill with disabling addictions, extreme behaviours, no permanent housing and regular police contact.&quot; As of 2009, the DTES was home to an estimated 1,800 to 3,600 individuals who were considered to be at &quot;extremely high health risk&quot; due to severe addiction or mental illness, equivalent to 60% of the population in this category for the 1 million people in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.

A 2013 study of SRO tenants in the greater DTES found that 95.2% had some form of substance dependence, and 74.4% had a mental illness, including 47.4% with psychosis. Only one-third of individuals with psychosis received treatment, and among those with concurrent addiction, the proportion receiving treatment was even lower. A 2016 study of the 323 most chronic offenders in the DTES found that 99% had at least one mental disorder, and more than 80% also had substance abuse issues. Between 60% and 70% of mentally ill patients treated at St. Paul&#x27;s Hospital, the hospital closest to the DTES, are estimated to have multiple addictions. Possible explanations for the high level of co-occurrence between addiction and mental illness in the DTES include the vulnerability of the mentally ill to drug dealers and a recent rise in crystal methamphetamine use, which can cause permanent psychosis.

====Substance use====

A 2010 BBC article described the DTES as &quot;home to one of the worst drug problems in North America.&quot; In 2011, crack cocaine was the most commonly used illicit hard drug in Vancouver, followed by injected prescription opioids (such as fentanyl and OxyContin), heroin, crystal methamphetamine (usually injected rather than smoked), and cocaine (also usually injected). Alcoholism, especially when it involves the use of highly toxic isopropyl alcohol, is a significant source of harm to residents of the DTES.

In 2016, a board member of the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users said that in the previous year, Vancouver&#x27;s supply of heroin had virtually disappeared and been replaced by fentanyl, which is cheaper and more potent. At the end of 2014, the DTES saw a dramatic rise in fentanyl overdoses. In 2016 the surge in drug overdose deaths led to the declaration of a public health emergency across the province.

In a 2008 survey of SRO residents in the greater DTES, 32% self-reported as being addicted to drugs, 20% were addicted to alcohol, 52% smoked cigarettes regularly, and 51% smoked marijuana. In 2003, the DTES was home to an estimated 4,700 injection drug users. Most live in unstable housing or are homeless, and approximately 20% are sex workers. In 2006, DTES residents incurred half of the deaths from illegal drug overdoses in the entire province. Between 1996 and 2011, there have been large fluctuations in drug usage, with the most recent trend being an overall decline in illicit drug use between 2007 and 2011. However, between 2010 and 2014, hospitalizations related to addictions increased by 89% at St. Paul&#x27;s Hospital.

According to a 2008 survey of greater DTES area SROs, tenants who used drugs estimated the cost of their habits at $30 per day, on average. Some spend hundreds of dollars per day on drugs. Police attribute much of the property crime in Vancouver to chronic repeat offenders who steal to support their drug habits.

====Mental illness====
The VPD reported in 2008 that in its district, which includes the Downtown Eastside, mental health was a factor in 42% of all incidents in which police were involved. The police department says its officers are often forced to act as front-line mental health workers due to lacking more appropriate support for this population.

In 2013, the city and police department reported that in the previous three years, there had been a 43% increase in people with severe mental illness or addiction in the emergency department of St. Paul&#x27;s Hospital. In Vancouver, apprehensions under the &quot;Mental Health Act&quot; rose by 16% between 2010 and 2012, and there was also an increase in the number of violent incidents involving mentally ill people. Mayor Gregor Robertson described the mental health crisis as &quot;on par with, if not more serious than&quot; the DTES HIV / AIDS epidemic that had led to a declaration of a public health emergency in 1997.

==== Overdose crisis ====
Drug overdose deaths across the province of British Columbia increased from an annual average of 203 during the first decade of the 2000s to 2,574 in 2023. In 2023, the City of Vancouver accounted for 22% of the province&#x27;s fatal overdoses, and in Vancouver, authorities have repeatedly acknowledged that the DTES struggles with especially acute problems of addiction and overdose deaths.

The introduction of the synthetic opioid fentanyl is a leading cause of the increase in overdose deaths. In 2012, there were 270 fatal overdoses in B.C. and fentanyl was associated with 4% of them. Five years later, in 2017, there were 1,495 fatal overdoses and fentanyl was associated with 82% of them. Since 2017, fentanyl has remained associated with more than 80% of fatal overdoses in BC.

Other factors contributing to a rise in overdose deaths often discussed by Vancouver media reports include a lack of mental health care services, Vancouver&#x27;s disproportionately large homeless population, and the war on drugs and the iron law of prohibition, which states that when police enforce a drug&#x27;s criminalization, they do not reduce the availability of the drug type, but rather, encourage the proliferation of a more potent formulation.

In a report presented to the City Council of Vancouver by Mayor Kennedy Stewart on 20 December 2018 regarding the opioid crisis, he stated:

===Sex work===

Vancouver has an estimated 1,000 street-based sex workers. According to the police, most of them work in the DTES. They call the neighbourhood and contiguous industrial areas near Vancouver&#x27;s port these &quot;outdoor workers&quot; (previously referred to using the more stigmatizing language including &quot;low track&quot; workers), where they typically earn $5 to $20 for a &quot;date&quot;. Most are survival sex workers who use sex work to support their substance use; up to two-thirds say they have been physically or sexually assaulted while working. Sex workers, particularly women with children, find it difficult to find housing that they can afford, and often have difficulty leaving the industry because of criminal records or addictions that make it harder to find jobs.

Although Indigenous Canadians makeup only 2% of Vancouver&#x27;s population, approximately 40% of Vancouver&#x27;s street-based sex workers are Indigenous. In one 2005 study, 52% of the sex workers surveyed in Vancouver were Indigenous, 96% reported having been sexually abused in childhood, and 81% reported childhood physical abuse. Some researchers and Indigenous advocacy groups have attributed the over-representation of Indigenous people in Vancouver&#x27;s sex trade to transgenerational trauma, linking it to Canada&#x27;s colonial history and in particular, to the cultural and individual damage caused by the residential schools, which previous generations of indigenous Canadians were forced to attend.

==== Displacement ====
After the displacements that occurred on Dupont and Davie Street, Vancouver&#x27;s outdoor sex workers were pushed to the streets of the Downtown Eastside. Here they are facing more violence than ever before. Neighbourhood harassment, policing, and developmental changes contribute to these conditions. Throughout all of the areas where sex work has been present, the city has been critiqued for backing up property owners to harass workers collectively. In the Downtown Eastside, these behaviours have continued to persist. A study published in 2017 containing interviews with thirty-three sex workers addressed concerns with changes in construction, surveillance, and security measures that have pushed workers into isolated areas where they are at greater risk of harm. The growth of new businesses in the area has also required workers to develop good relations to prevent frequent police calls. These conditions have also forced workers to rush or forgo screening and negotiation processes that increase the risk of bad dates and STI contractions. This disproportionately impacted the safety of oppressed communities such as indigenous, substance-dependent and transgender workers who are often restricted to this area. Over the years, this has also contributed to the many missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG) cases, including those involved in the mass killings by serial killer Robert Pickton.

===Crime and public disorder===

Reported crime rates in the DTES are higher than in the rest of the city, with most crimes being assaults, robberies, or public intoxication. Although it is home to 3% of Vancouver&#x27;s population, the DTES was the location of 16% of the city&#x27;s reported sexual assaults in 2012. In 2008, it was the location of 34.5% of all reported serious assaults and 22.6% of all robberies in the city.

These figures may be an underestimate, as marginalized populations such as DTES residents tend to be less likely to report crime. Many residents are survivors of the Canadian Indian residential school system or experience transgenerational trauma as a result of Residential Schools, and are further traumatized by excessive policing.

The figures do not indicate how many of the reported crimes were committed by DTES residents; some residents and business owners believe that visitors from other neighbourhoods are responsible for a significant proportion of serious crimes. According to police, DTES women say that what they fear most are &quot;predatory drug dealers who conduct their business with violence, torture, and terror.&quot;

In addition to reported crime, the DTES has the highly visible street disorder, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;a shock even to someone familiar with the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the 1980s or the Tenderloin in San Francisco.&quot; Some government social workers have refused to enter certain SROs out of concern for their safety, despite being mandated to monitor children who live there. Tourists are often encouraged to avoid the DTES. However, they are seldom victims of crime. High crime rates and difficulties in obtaining affordable property insurance deter legitimate businesses from opening or staying in the area, resulting in many vacant storefronts.

===Poverty===

The greater DTES area is significantly poorer than the rest of Vancouver, with a median income of $13,691 versus $47,229 for the city as a whole. 53% of the greater DTES population is low-income, compared to 13.6% of the population of Metro Vancouver. In the V6A postal area, whose boundaries are similar to the greater DTES area, 6,339 residents received some form of social assistance in 2013. Of these, 3,193 were considered disabled and 1,461 were considered &quot;employable&quot;. The base welfare rate for single adults who are considered employable is $610 per month: $375 per month for shelter and $235 ($335 since July 2017) per month for all other expenses. Advocates for low-income DTES residents say this amount, which has not increased since 2007, is not enough to live on. In 1981, the base welfare rate was equivalent to $970 per month after adjustment for inflation.

Some DTES residents supplement their incomes through the informal economy, through volunteer work which can yield stipends, or through criminal activity or sex work. A 2008 survey of SRO residents found that the average tenant income from all sources, including the informal economy, was $1,109 per month.

In addition to addiction and mental illness issues, DTES residents often have difficulty finding employment due to mental and physical disabilities and a lack of education and skills. According to a 2009 survey of the 30 blocks in and around the DTES, 62% of the residents over the age of 15 were not considered participants in the labour force, compared to 33% in Vancouver as a whole.

The DTES is often referred to as &quot;Canada&#x27;s poorest postal code,&quot; although this is not the case.

===Housing===

Both homelessness and substandard housing are major issues in the DTES that compound the neighbourhood&#x27;s problems with addiction and mental illness. In 2012, there were 846 homeless people in the greater DTES area, including 171 who were not in some form of shelter. The DTES homeless made up approximately half of the city&#x27;s total homeless population, over a third of whom are Indigenous.

Thousands of DTES residents live in SROs, which provide low-cost rooms without private kitchens or bathrooms, Although conditions in SROs vary considerably, they have become notorious for their squalor and chaos. Many are over 100 years old and in extreme disrepair, with shortages of necessities such as heat and functioning plumbing. In 2007, it was reported that four out of five rooms had bed bugs, cockroaches, and fire code violations. Even at their best, the SROs lack living space, resulting in tenants spending more time in the public areas of the DTES, including its street-based drug scene.

SRO landlords have often been called &quot;slumlords&quot; for failing to fix problems and illegally evicting tenants. The city has often been slow to force SRO owners to make significant repairs, saying that owners could not afford to make them without raising rents and adversely affecting affordability.

==== Housing availability and affordability ====

The City refers to the housing and homelessness situation in the DTES as a &quot;crisis&quot;. There is wide support amongst governments, experts, and community groups on a Housing First model, which prioritizes stable, quality housing as a precursor to other interventions for the homeless, those who use drugs, or those with mental illness. Many people with severe addiction or mental illness require supportive housing.

As the DTES has many low-income adults who live alone and are at risk of homelessness, trends in housing options for low-income adults are of central importance to the neighbourhood. Although SROs have well-known problems, each SRO resident who loses their room and ends up on the street costs the provincial government approximately $30,000 to $40,000 per year in additional services.

In recent years, the number of units designed for low-income singles has increased slightly: In the downtown area (Burrard Street to Clark Drive), there were 11,371 units in 1993 and 12,126 units in 2013. The number of privately owned SROs declined during this time by 3283 units, while the number of social housing units increased by 4038 units. In 2014, 300 privately owned SRO units were lost.

However, rents in many of those units have risen. Rents in social housing units for low-income singles are fixed at the shelter component of welfare rates, but rents in privately owned SROs can vary. In 2013, 24% of privately owned SROs rented at the base welfare shelter rate of $375 per month, down from 60% in 2007. According to one advocacy group, the average lowest rent in privately owned hotels in the greater DTES area was $517 per month in 2015, and no vacant rooms were rented at less than $425 per month.

The city has implemented a bylaw to discourage the redevelopment of SROs. Advocates for SRO tenants argue that the city&#x27;s bylaw does not go far enough, as it does not prevent rent increases. The city says that only the province, not the city, has the jurisdiction to control rents and that the province should raise welfare rates.

Since 2007, the provincial government has acquired 23 privately owned SRO hotels in the greater DTES area, containing 1,500 units. It undertook extensive renovations in 13 buildings for $143.3  million, of which $29.1  the federal government paid million. Due to rising rents and often-decrepit conditions in the area&#x27;s remaining 4,484 privately owned SROs, DTES activists have called for governments to replace them with a further 5,000 social housing units for low-income singles.

===Health and well-being===
A 2013 study of SRO residents in the greater DTES area found that 18.4% were HIV positive and 70.3% were positive for hepatitis C. Few of those infected with hepatitis C receive treatment. The DTES population also has higher rates of tuberculosis and syphilis than the rest of the province, and injection drug users are susceptible to other infections such as endocarditis. Indigenous people are at the greatest risk from the disease.

Amongst the most vulnerable DTES residents, common issues with psychosocial well-being include low self-worth, lack of personal safety, lack of respect from others, social isolation, and low education levels. Many have lost custody of their children. A 2000 report from the Vancouver Native Health Society Medical Clinic said, &quot;Many individuals are survivors of severe childhood trauma. Negative experiences such as family violence, parental substance abuse, sexual and emotional abuse, suicide, divorce, and residential school atrocities are the norm.&quot; Many DTES residents are too unstable to keep appointments or reliably take medication.

Life expectancy in the greater DTES area is 79.9 years, a significant improvement since the mid-1990s. Some of the increase may, however, be explained by the migration of healthier residents to the neighbourhoods surrounding the DTES. A 2015 study of DTES SRO residents found that they were eight times more likely to die than the national average, mostly due to psychosis and hepatitis C-related liver dysfunction.

=== Costs ===

Several overlapping sets of data exist on costs related to the DTES:

* DTES-specific costs: Of the estimated $360 million per year to operate 260 social services and housing sites in the greater DTES area, three-quarters of the spending is funded by governments, and the rest by private donors. This figure includes operating costs of a range of organizations, including neighbourhood health care services, but does not include standard city operations, the capital costs of building social housing or other infrastructure, or hospital costs.
* Wider-area costs related to issues concentrated in the DTES: In the closest hospital to the DTES, Saint Paul&#x27;s, injection drug use leads to approximately 15% of admissions. The annual cost of ambulances responding to overdoses in Vancouver is $500,000, and the cost of police response to calls involving mental health problems is estimated to be $9 million per year.
* Costs per individual: For each untreated drug addict, the costs to society, including crime, judicial costs, and health care, are estimated to be at least $45,000 annually. The government-paid lifetime healthcare cost per HIV-infected injection drug user is estimated at $150,000. A 2008 study estimated that each homeless person in B.C. costs $55,000 per year in government-paid costs related to healthcare, corrections, and social services, whereas providing housing and support would cost $37,000 per year. Costs per individual vary widely: A 2016 study found that 107 chronic offenders in the DTES incur public service costs of $247,000 per person per year.

==Law enforcement==
In comparison to other Canadian cities, the VPD is generally considered to be progressive in dealing with drugs and sex work, emphasizing harm reduction over law enforcement.

The VPD engages in the controversial practice known as &quot;carding,&quot; or &quot;street checks,&quot; in which police stop and question individuals whom they suspect of being involved in criminal or suspicious activity. In Vancouver, 15% of street checks are on Indigenous people, representing just 2% of the general population, and 5% of reviews are on Black people, representing less than 1%. Some civil rights groups believe the VPD&#x27;s practices constitute racial profiling and result in excessive harassment and violence against Indigenous and Black residents.

Since the 1980s, the VPD has ignored drug use in the DTES, as the sheer volume of users makes it unfeasible to arrest all of them. A large-scale police crackdown on DTES drug users in 2003 made no difference except to displace drug use to adjacent neighbourhoods. To encourage people to call for help when a drug user is overdosing, paramedics rather than police respond to 911 calls about overdose deaths, except in cases where public safety is at risk.

Nationwide efforts to reduce the supply of drugs through law enforcement have had minimal impact on the easy availability or low prices of illicit drugs in Vancouver. By former mayor Mike Harcourt&#x27;s estimate, police intercept only 2% of the drugs that enter the city. Vancouver police guidelines on dealing with sex workers emphasize focusing on addressing violence, human trafficking, and involvement of youth or gangs in prostitution, whereas sex involving consenting adults is not an enforcement priority.

Relations between police and DTES women were strained by police shortcomings that allowed serial killer Robert Pickton to prey on the community for years before he was arrested in 2002; the VPD apologized in 2010 for its failures in apprehending him. In 2003, the Pivot Legal Society filed 50 complaints from DTES residents alleging police misconduct. An investigation by the RCMP, in which several VPD officers and the police chief failed to co-operate, found that 14 of those allegations were substantiated. In 2007, Pivot agreed to withdraw its remaining complaints, following apologies and changes to VPD policies and procedures.

In 2008, the VPD implemented a crackdown on minor offences, such as illegal vending on sidewalks and jaywalking. The ticketing blitz was stopped after objections from community groups. Residents with unpaid tickets – particularly women and sex workers – would be less afraid to approach the police to report serious safety concerns.

In 2010, police launched an initiative to combat violence against DTES women that resulted in the convictions of several violent offenders. However, the level of trust toward police remains low. According to some DTES activists, &quot;gentrification / condos and police brutality,&quot; rather than drugs, are the two worst problems in the neighbourhood.

== Controversies ==

=== Concentration of services controversy ===


The DTES is the site of many service offerings, including social housing, health care, free meals and clothing, harm reduction for drug users, housing assistance, employment preparation, adult education, children&#x27;s programs, emergency housing, arts and recreation, and legal advocacy. In 2014, the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; reported that there were 260 social services and housing sites in the greater DTES area, spending $360 million per year. No other Canadian city has concentrated services to this degree in one small area.

Proponents of the high level of services say that it is necessary to meet the complex needs of the DTES population. For some residents, the sense of community and acceptance that they find in the DTES makes it a unique place of healing for them.

Locating many services in the DTES has also been criticized for attracting vulnerable people to an area where drugs, crime, and disorder are entrenched. Some advocates for vulnerable populations believe that many DTES residents would have a better quality of life and improved chances of health if they could separate from the neighbourhood&#x27;s predatory drug pushers and pimps.

During the city&#x27;s 2014 planning process for the greater DTES, two-thirds of those who participated said they wanted to stay in the area. But a 2008 survey of SRO tenants had indicated that 70% wanted to leave the DTES. The city&#x27;s 30-year plan is for two-thirds of the city&#x27;s future social housing to be located in the greater DTES area.

==== Views on services in other neighbourhoods ====
Vancouver Coastal Health says that the lack of appropriate care for complex social and health issues outside of the DTES often does not allow people &quot;the choice to remain in their home community where their natural support systems exist... A common barrier that prevents mentally ill and addicted people from living outside of the DTES is a lack of appropriate services and support. Too often, clients who secure housing outside the neighbourhood return to the DTES regularly because of the lack of support in other communities.&quot;

Proposals to add social housing and services for those with addiction or mental health issues to other Metro Vancouver neighbourhoods are often met with Nimbyism, even when residents selected for such projects would be low-risk individuals. A 2012 poll of Metro Vancouver residents found that although nine out of 10 of those surveyed wanted the homeless to have access to services they need, 54% believed that &quot;housing in their community should be there for the people who can afford it.&quot; Some commentators have suggested that Vancouver residents tacitly agree to have the DTES act as a de facto ghetto for the most troubled individuals in the city.

=== Gentrification controversy ===

The DTES lies a few blocks east of the city&#x27;s most expensive commercial real estate. Since the mid-2000s, new development in the DTES has brought a mixture of market-rate housing (primarily condominiums), social housing, office spaces, restaurants, and shops. Property values in the DTES area increased by 303% between 2001 and 2013. Prices at the newer retail establishments are often far higher than low-income residents can afford.

The city promotes mixed-income housing, and requires new large housing developments in the DTES to set aside 20% of their units for social housing. As of 2014, in a section of Hastings Street from Carrall Street to Heatley Avenue, at least 60% of units must be dedicated to social housing and the rest must be rental units. Rents in at least one-third of new social housing units are not permitted to exceed the shelter component of welfare rates.

Proponents say that new developments revitalize the area, improve the quality of life, provide new social housing, and encourage a stronger retail environment and a stabilizing street presence. They emphasize that their goal is for the DTES to include a mixture of income levels and avoid the problems associated with concentrated poverty, not to become an expensive yuppie-oriented neighbourhood like nearby Yaletown.

Others oppose the addition of market housing and upscale businesses to the DTES, in the belief that these changes will drive up prices, displace low-income residents, and make poor people feel less at home. Protests against new businesses and housing developments have occasionally turned violent.

== Strategies ==

=== Housing strategies ===

Although housing and homelessness are often perceived as municipal issues, social housing is traditionally funded primarily by senior levels of government, which receive 92% of tax revenue in Canada. Libby Davies, a former DTES activist and Member of Parliament, called for a National Housing Strategy in 2009, saying that Canada is the world&#x27;s only industrialized country with no national housing plan.

In 2014, the City of Vancouver approved a 30-year plan for the greater DTES area. It sets out a goal of having 4,400 units of social housing added to the greater DTES area, 3,350 units of social housing added elsewhere in the city, and 1,900 units of new supportive housing scattered throughout the city. The cost of implementing the plan is estimated at $1 billion, of which $220-million would be paid by the city, $300-million by developers, and more than $500-million from the provincial or national governments. The provincial government, which recently invested $300 million in social housing in Vancouver, said it will not fund the proposed housing expansion and that its housing strategy had shifted towards other models such as rent assistance rather than construction.

=== Addiction and mental illness strategies ===
In 2001, the city adopted a &quot;Four Pillars&quot; drug strategy consisting of four equally important &quot;pillars&quot;: prevention, treatment, enforcement, and harm reduction. Advocates of the Four Pillars strategy say that the 36 recommendations associated with the policy have only been partially implemented, with prevention, treatment, and harm reduction all being underfunded. Across Canada, 94% of drug strategy dollars are spent on enforcement. The city&#x27;s 2014 Local Area Plan for the DTES does not propose solutions to the neighbourhood&#x27;s drug problems; an article in the &quot;National Post&quot; described it as a &quot;221-page document that expertly skirted around any mention of the Downtown Eastside as a failed community in need of a drastic turnaround.&quot;

The VPD, B.C. Medical Association and the City of Vancouver have asked the province to urgently increase capacity for treating addiction and mental illness. In 2009, the BCMA asked that detoxification be available on demand, with no waiting period, by 2012. A 2016 study of youth who used illicit drugs in Vancouver indicated that 28% had tried unsuccessfully to access addiction treatment in the previous 6 months, with the lack of success primarily due to being placed on waiting lists.

After the city and police department described an emerging mental health crisis in Vancouver in 2013, the province implemented three of their five recommendations within a year, including new Assertive Community Treatment teams and a nine-bed urgent care facility at St. Paul&#x27;s Hospital. In response to a recommendation that the province adds 300 new long-term health care beds for the most severely mentally ill, provincial Health Minister Terry Lake said that more research was needed to determine whether these beds were urgently needed. As of 2015, the province had opened or committed to only 50 new beds.

=== Co-ordination of services ===
Although DTES residents often have a complex combination of needs, services are typically delivered from the perspective of a single discipline (such as police or medical) or a particular agency&#x27;s mandate, with little communication between the service providers who are working with a given individual. Despite widespread agreement in principle that a coordinated approach is necessary to improve conditions for DTES residents, the three levels of government have not agreed on any overall long-term plan for the DTES, and there is no overall co-ordination of services for the area.

In 2009, the VPD proposed creating a steering committee of senior city and provincial stakeholders, which would be mandated to improve collaboration between service providers to enable a client-centric rather than a discipline-centric model. The report recommends prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable individuals in the neighbourhood, saying that having them get the assistance they require is &quot;a necessary condition for other neighbourhood improvement initiatives to succeed.&quot;

In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, a Coordinated Community Response Network was formed to distribute funds, resources, and support in the neighbourhood. The network consists of a coordinated effort of over 50 social service and frontline organizations and groups.

== Notable activists ==
* Shirley Chan, a prominent community activist and co-founder of the Strathcona Property Owners and Tenants Association (SPOTA), has worked for decades to revitalize Chinatown and preserve historical sites in the neighbourhood from development.
* Bruce Eriksen (1928–1997), founder of the Downtown Eastside Residents Association (DERA)
* Bud Osborn (1947–2014) and Ann Livingston, co-founders of the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU)

==Portrayals in media==
Films set in the Downtown Eastside include &quot;On the Corner, The Ballad of Oppenheimer Park,&quot; and &quot;Luk&#x27;Luk&#x27;I&quot;. The Matthew Good album Vancouver was inspired by the Downtown Eastside.

<text>Quesnel (; Kee-nel in French) is a city located in the Cariboo Regional District of British Columbia, Canada. Located nearly evenly between the cities of Prince George and Williams Lake, it is on the main route to northern British Columbia and the Yukon. Quesnel is located at the confluence of the Fraser River and Quesnel River. As of 2021, Quesnel&#x27;s metropolitan area (census agglomeration) had a population of 23,113 making it one of the largest urban centres between Prince George and Kamloops.

Quesnel is a sister city to Shiraoi, Japan. Quesnel hosted the 2000 BC Winter Games, a biennial provincial amateur sports competition. To the east of Quesnel is Wells, Barkerville, and Bowron Lake Provincial Park, a popular canoeing destination in the Cariboo Mountains.

==History==

Long before the arrival of prospectors during the Cariboo Gold Rush of 1862, the First Nations peoples, the Dakelh or Southern Carrier, lived off the land around Quesnel, occupying the area from the Bowron Lakes in the east to the upper Blackwater River and Dean River in the west. The Southern Carrier Nation were known among themselves as ‘Uda Ukelh’, meaning ‘people who travel by boat on water early in the morning’.

The name &quot;Quesnel&quot; is derived from Jules-Maurice Quesnel, who accompanied Simon Fraser on his journey to the Pacific Ocean. Quesnel came to be called &#x27;Quesnelle Mouth&#x27; to distinguish it from Quesnel Forks, up river. In 1870, it had been shortened to Quesnelle and by 1900, it was spelled the way it is now. Quesnel is located along the gold mining trail known as the Cariboo Wagon Road and supplied nearby Barkerville, the commercial centre of the Cariboo Gold Rush. It also marks one end of the Alexander MacKenzie Heritage Trail.

Because of its location on the Fraser River, it was also an important landing for sternwheelers from 1862 to 1886 and then, from 1909 until 1921. The last sternwheeler on the upper Fraser was Quesnel&#x27;s own namesake craft, and home town product, the &quot;Quesnel&quot;. Quesnel was incorporated in 1928.

<doc id="332296" wikidata="Q696680" url="?curid=332296" title="Four Noes and One Without">
<text>The Four Noes and One Without (), also known as the Four Noes () was a pledge by former President of the Republic of China Chen Shui-bian made in his inauguration speech on 20 May 2000, concerning the political status of Taiwan. It was an important part of cross-straits relations.

The pledge was that, provided the People&#x27;s Republic of China has no intention to use military force against Taiwan, Chen&#x27;s administration would not:
# declare Taiwanese independence,
# change the national title from &quot;the Republic of China&quot; to &quot;the Republic of Taiwan&quot;,
# include the doctrine of special state-to-state relations in the Constitution of the Republic of China, or
# promote a referendum on unification or independence.
In addition, the &quot;One Without&quot; was that Chen&#x27;s administration would not abolish the National Unification Council (later abolished in 2006) or the National Unification Guidelines though during his administration the National Unification Council met only once. On February 27, 2006, the Council ceased to function in tandem with the elimination of its already meager budget. Chen said that his decision did not change the &quot;status quo&quot; in the Taiwan Strait, but instead returned sovereignty to the people of Taiwan.

The Four Noes and One Without were an important part of Republic of China-United States relations. Several times, Chen had to reassure the United States that the Four Noes and One Without policy had not been abolished and that he was not attempting to circumvent the pledge via any loopholes. The phrase that the United States used with regard to the policy of &quot;Four Noes and One Without&quot; was that the United States &quot;appreciate[d] Chen&#x27;s pledge and t[ook] it very seriously.&quot;

==Policy revision==

On 27 February 2006, Chen dismantled the National Unification Council and Guidelines saying they &quot;will cease functioning and the budget no longer be appropriated&quot;, effectively breaking the promises made in 2000 if &#x27;cease functioning&#x27; is considered to be synonymous with &#x27;abolishing&#x27;. However, as the People&#x27;s Republic of China has threatened to use military force against Taiwan by passing the Anti-Secession Law in March 2005 and continuing the buildup of missiles opposite the Taiwan Strait, the no intent of aggression provision may have long been violated. It is noteworthy that the 2004 referendum called by President Chen Shui-bian held in tandem with the presidential election used the &#x27;emergent threat&#x27; stipulation in Taiwan&#x27;s Referendum Law, thereby implying the provision had already been breached by China&#x27;s imminent threat and missile buildup. Nevertheless, this move drew sharp rebuke from the United States, with the State Department insisting that the Taiwanese government clarify that the National Unification Council has not been abolished. However, in a TV interview days later, Chen stated that &#x27;ceasing to function&#x27; is the same as having been &#x27;abolished&#x27;.

In the week prior, he told U.S. Congressman Rob Simmons (R-CT) that the Council and Guidelines were &quot;absurd products of an absurd era.&quot; Chen revealed he planned to draft a new constitution, which many conjectured would be pro-separatist, before he stepped down in 2008.

The Four Noes and One Without policy was officially replaced by Four Wants and One Without policy in 2007, which is essentially the opposite of the original Four Noes and One Without policy.

When Tsai Ing-wen became president in 2016, she announced what has been called a New Four Noes policy: &quot;our pledges will not change, and our goodwill will not change; but we will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation&quot;.

==Criticism==
Koo Kwang-ming and other pro-independence leaders openly criticized that Chen, as president, is &quot;not constitutionally authorized&quot; and has &quot;no legal power&quot; to confine Taiwanese political future and freedom with the pledge. In addition, some of Chen&#x27;s supporters such as Vice-president Annette Lu have suggested that the pledge may have loopholes such as the definition of military force. Furthermore, while the pledge stated that Chen would not support a referendum, some have suggested that it does not exclude the possibility of a referendum occurring by citizen initiative. The possibility of loopholes has occasionally led to considerable unease in Beijing and in Washington, D.C.

Under strong objection from pro-independence leaders and his supporters, who threatened to walk out the inauguration ceremony immediately once the pledge was recited, Chen did not explicitly repeat this pledge in his 2004 inauguration speech after his re-election though he alluded to the pledge by stating that the assurances he had given in the 2000 inaugural address remained in effect, and he has stated many times that the pledge remains in effect.

<text>Angelo Daniel Badalamenti (March 22, 1937 – December 11, 2022) was an American composer and arranger best known for his film music, notably the scores for his collaborations with director David Lynch, &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986), &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–1991; 2017), &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992), &quot;The Straight Story&quot; (1999), and &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; (2001).

Badalamenti also composed scores for such films as &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989), &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; (1995), &quot;Holy Smoke!&quot; (1999), and &quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot; (2004), and recorded songs with artists including Julee Cruise (in collaboration with Lynch), Nina Simone, Shirley Bassey, Pet Shop Boys, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull, David Bowie, Tim Booth, Siouxsie Sioux and Dolores O&#x27;Riordan.

In 1990, Badalamenti won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance for his &quot;&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; Theme&quot; at the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards. He received a lifetime achievement award from the World Soundtrack Awards&#x27;s Academy in 2008 and the Henry Mancini Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers in 2011.

==Early life==
Angelo Daniel Badalamenti was born on March 22, 1937, in Brooklyn, New York, the second of four children born to Leonora () and John Badalamenti. His father, who was of Italian descent from the town of Cinisi, was a fish market owner. He began taking piano lessons at age eight. By the time Badalamenti was a teenager, his aptitude at the piano earned him a summer job accompanying singers at resorts in the Catskill Mountains. His elder brother was a jazz trumpet player who used to improvise with other musicians. He also went to Latin American dance clubs. Badalamenti attended Lafayette High School, where he wrote the processional march for his high school graduation. After graduating, he enrolled at the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester, but transferred after two years to the Manhattan School of Music, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1958 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1959. He began composing music pieces in Kurt Weill&#x27;s style.

==Film and television scoring==
Badalamenti scored films such as &quot;Gordon&#x27;s War&quot; and &quot;Law and Disorder&quot;, but his break came when he was hired as Isabella Rossellini&#x27;s singing coach for the song &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; in David Lynch&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;. Badalamenti and Lynch collaborated to write &quot;Mysteries of Love&quot; using lyrics Lynch wrote. Julee Cruise, who went on to work with Lynch and Badalamenti on other projects, performed the vocals for that track. Badalamenti composed the film&#x27;s score and served as music supervisor. Lynch&#x27;s request to him was for the score to be &quot;like Shostakovich, be very Russian, but make it the most beautiful thing but make it dark and a little bit scary.&quot; Badalamenti appears in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; as the piano player in the club where Rossellini&#x27;s character performs. This film was the first instance of a career-long collaborative relationship with Lynch spanning television and film. Badalamenti dubbed their partnership &quot;my second-best marriage&quot;.

After scoring a variety of mainstream films, including &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot;, Badalamenti again collaborated with Lynch in scoring Lynch&#x27;s television show &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, featuring Cruise&#x27;s vocals on the leading song &quot;Falling&quot;. &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; became the score Badalamenti is perhaps best known for, one that helped define the show&#x27;s style and mood. The score features different themes patterned after specific characters in the show—&quot;Audrey&#x27;s Dance&quot;, for example, is an &quot;abstract jazzy&quot; theme that plays when Audrey Horne (played by Sherilyn Fenn) is onscreen. Many of the songs from the series were released on Cruise&#x27;s album &quot;Floating into the Night&quot;. Badalamenti won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance for the &quot;Twin Peaks Theme&quot; from the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; soundtrack. The song also earned a gold plaque from the RIAA. Between 1991 and 1993, Badalamenti and Lynch collaborated on the project Thought Gang, the results of which were released in 2018.

Other Lynch projects Badalamenti worked on include the movies &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;, &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;, &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, &quot;The Straight Story&quot;, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; (in which he has a small role as a gangster with a finicky taste for espresso), and &quot;Rabbits&quot;, and the television shows &quot;On the Air&quot; and &quot;Hotel Room&quot;. His projects with other directors include the TV film &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; and the films &quot;Naked in New York&quot;, &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot;, &quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot;, &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, &quot;Dark Water&quot;, and &quot;Secretary&quot;. He also worked on the soundtrack for the video game &quot;Fahrenheit&quot; (known as &quot;Indigo Prophecy&quot; in North America), and wrote the music for Paul Schrader&#x27;s films &quot;Auto Focus&quot;, &quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

In 1995, he asked Marianne Faithfull to write lyrics for a song for the soundtrack of Jean-Pierre Jeunet&#x27;s &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot;; the result was &quot;Who Will Take My Dreams Away&quot;.

In 1998, Badalamenti recorded &quot;A Foggy Day (in London Town)&quot; with David Bowie for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Red Hot + Rhapsody&quot;, a tribute to George Gershwin that raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease. Badalamenti had sent a demo of the song with his own vocals to the record company and Bowie was the first singer to respond. In 1999, he worked with director Jane Campion on the film &quot;Holy Smoke!&quot;, writing the soundtrack after working with Campion for a few days.

In 2005, he composed the themes for the movie &quot;Napola&quot; (&quot;Before the Fall&quot;), which were then adapted for the score by Normand Corbeil. In 2008, he composed and directed the soundtrack of &quot;The Edge of Love&quot;: Siouxsie Sioux sang the Weill-influenced &quot;Careless Love&quot;, and Patrick Wolf and Beth Rowley recorded vocals for several other tracks.

Badalamenti received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the World Soundtrack Awards on October 18, 2008, in Ghent, Belgium. That night, he performed a concert at the piano with the Brussels Philharmonic orchestra directed by Dirk Brossé, with Siouxsie Sioux and Beth Rowley on vocals. The concert, spanning his whole career with a selection of tracks, was broadcast on Belgian television.

On July 23, 2011, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers gave Badalamenti the Henry Mancini Award for his accomplishments in film and television music.

The 2017 revival of the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; television series marked the continuation of Badalamenti&#x27;s work with Lynch. Its score features new compositions by Badalamenti as well as material from the original score.

==Collaborations==
From the start, Badalamenti collaborated with other songwriters. In 1964, he contributed to Beatlemania by arranging, conducting, and co-writing a Christmas novelty single, &quot;Santa, Bring Me Ringo&quot;, which was performed by Christine Hunter. In 1966, he co-wrote a song, &quot;Visa to the Stars&quot;, on Perrey and Kingsley&#x27;s album &quot;The In Sound from Way Out!&quot; In 1967, using the name Andy Badale, he co-wrote a song, &quot;Pioneers of the Stars&quot;, for Perrey and Kingsley&#x27;s next album, &quot;Kaleidoscopic Vibrations: Electronic Pop Music From Way Out&quot;. The same year, he and Norm Simon co-wrote &quot;I Want to Love You for What You Are&quot;, a No. 54 pop hit for Ronnie Dove. He also arranged, produced, and co-wrote some songs on Perrey&#x27;s two solo albums for Vanguard Records using the Badale pseudonym. 

Badalamenti also wrote songs for Nina Simone and Shirley Bassey. In 1967, he co-wrote the song &quot;I Hold No Grudge&quot; for Simone&#x27;s album &quot;High Priestess of Soul&quot;. In 1968, he and Sammy Cahn wrote &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Loved&quot; for Bassey’s album &quot;This Is My Life&quot;.

In 1987, he lent his services to the British synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, orchestrating &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;. He also arranged the strings on two tracks from their 1990 album &quot;Behaviour&quot;.

Badalamenti arranged songs for artists such as Dusty Springfield and Paul McCartney. In 1989 he arranged Springfield&#x27;s single &quot;Nothing Has Been Proved&quot;, which was written by the Pet Shop Boys.

Badalementi conceived entire albums with singers such as Julee Cruise, Marianne Faithfull and Tim Booth of the band James. In 1993, he and Lynch directed an album for Cruise, &quot;The Voice of Love&quot;, which included several tracks from &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. Also in 1993, he collaborated with thrash metal band Anthrax on the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;-inspired track &quot;Black Lodge&quot; from the album &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot;.

In 1995, Badalamenti composed, orchestrated, and produced Faithfull&#x27;s album &quot;A Secret Life&quot;. In 1996, he teamed up with Tim Booth as Booth and the Bad Angel; they released their eponymous album on the Mercury label. In 2000, he worked with Orbital on the single &quot;Beached&quot; for the movie &quot;The Beach&quot;. In 2004, he composed the &quot;Evilenko&quot; soundtrack, working with Dolores O&#x27;Riordan, who sang the main theme and with whom he continued to collaborate.

==Other projects==
Badalamenti composed some of the score for the opening ceremony of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

==Live performances==
Badalamenti performed at a concert entitled &quot;The Music of David Lynch&quot; in 2015, in recognition of the tenth anniversary of the David Lynch Foundation. The performance was held at Ace Hotel Los Angeles and included Julee Cruise and other artists known for collaborating with Lynch.

==Personal life==
Badalamenti and his wife, Lonny, married in 1968 and had two children. He died of natural causes at his home in Lincoln Park, New Jersey, on December 11, 2022, at age 85. Following his death, several industry figures paid tribute to Badalamenti. David Lynch, during his daily installment of &quot;Weather Report&quot; on December 12, said, &quot;Today—no music&quot;.

<doc id="332303" wikidata="Q613355" url="?curid=332303" title="Kumamoto Castle">
<text>is a hilltop Japanese castle located in Chūō-ku, Kumamoto, in Kumamoto Prefecture. It was a large and well-fortified castle. The is a concrete reconstruction built in 1960, but a number of ancillary wooden buildings remain of the original castle. Kumamoto Castle is considered one of the three premier castles in Japan, along with Himeji Castle and Matsumoto Castle. Thirteen structures in the castle complex are designated Important Cultural Property.

==History==
Kumamoto Castle&#x27;s history dates to 1467, when fortifications were established by Ideta Hidenobu. In 1496, these fortifications were expanded by Kanokogi Chikakazu. In 1588, Katō Kiyomasa was transferred to the early incarnation of Kumamoto Castle. From 1601 to 1607, Kiyomasa greatly expanded the castle, transforming it into a castle complex with 49 turrets, 18 turret gates, and 29 smaller gates. The smaller castle tower, built sometime after the keep, had several facilities including a well and kitchen. In 1610, the Honmaru Goten Palace was completed. The castle complex measures roughly from east to west, and from north to south. The castle keep is tall.

The castle was besieged in 1877 during the Satsuma Rebellion, and the castle keep and other parts were burned down. The strength of the castle was demonstrated by its ability to withstand 19th-century weapons without falling. Saigō Takamori famously remarked, &quot;I did not lose to the Meiji government. I lost to Lord Kiyomasa.&quot; 13 of the buildings in the castle complex were undamaged, and have been designated Important Cultural Properties. In 1960, the castle keep was reconstructed using concrete. From 1998 to 2008, the castle complex underwent restoration work, during which most of the 17th-century structures were rebuilt.

The signature curved stone walls, known as &quot;musha-gaeshi&quot;, as well as wooden overhangs, were designed to prevent attackers from penetrating the castle. Rock falls were also used as deterrents.

In nearby San-no-Maru Park is the Hosokawa Gyobu-tei, the former residence of the Hosokawa clan, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Higo Province during the Edo period. This traditional wooden mansion has a noted Japanese garden located in its grounds.

In 2006, Kumamoto Castle was listed as one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation. On December 7, 2007, a large-scale renovation of the Inner Palace was completed. A public ceremony for the restoration was held on April 20, 2008.

The castle sustained damage in a magnitude 6.2 earthquake that struck at 9:26 pm on 14 April 2016, in Mashiki town in Kumamoto prefecture. This event is substantially similar to the magnitude-6.3 1889 Kumamoto earthquake which also damaged the castle. A stone wall at the foot of the keep partially collapsed in the 2016 quake, and several of the castle&#x27;s &quot;shachihoko&quot; ornaments fell from the roof of the keep and broke apart. It sustained further extensive damage the next day on 15 April following a 7.3 magnitude earthquake where some portions were completely destroyed. While the keep itself withstood most of the earthquake with little structural damage, two of the castle&#x27;s turrets were severely damaged and partially collapsed, more of the exterior walls at the foot of the keep also collapsed, and large amounts of &quot;kawara&quot; roof tiles on the keep&#x27;s roof were also disrupted and fell from the roof as a result of the quake. The fallen roof tiles are actually deliberately designed to have done so – when the castle was constructed, such roof tiles were used so that in the event of an earthquake, the tiles would fall off the damaged roof, preventing it from being weighted down and collapsing into the building&#x27;s interior.

Efforts to repair the castle began June 8, 2016. On April 7, 2018, the newly made &quot;shachihoko&quot; ornament had been installed on the top roof of the large tenshu tower with the second one being installed on April 12. The restoration of the main tower was completed in 2019. The restoration of the Nagabei Wall was completed in January, 2021. The repair and restoration of the entire castle were scheduled for completion by 2037. However, in November 2022, Kumamoto Mayor announced that the reconstruction would take 15 years longer to complete, with full restoration scheduled for 2052.

<text>George R. Crook (September 8, 1828 – March 21, 1890) was a career United States Army officer who served in the American Civil War and the Indian Wars. He is best known for commanding U.S. forces in the 1886 campaign that led to the defeat of the Apache leader Geronimo. As a result, the Apache nicknamed Crook &quot;Nantan Lupan&quot;, which means &quot;Chief Wolf.&quot;

==Early life and military career==
Crook was born to Thomas and Elizabeth Matthews Crook on a farm near Taylorsville, Ohio. Nominated to the United States Military Academy by Congressman Robert Schenck, he graduated in 1852, ranking near the bottom of his class.

He was assigned to the 4th U.S. infantry as brevet second lieutenant, serving in California, 1852–61. He served in Oregon and northern California, alternately protecting or fighting against several Native American tribes. He commanded the Pitt River Expedition of 1857 and, in one of several engagements, was severely wounded by an Indian arrow. He established a fort in Northeast California that was later named in his honor; and later, Fort Ter-Waw in what is now Klamath Glen, California.

During his years of service in California and Oregon, Crook extended his prowess in hunting and wilderness skills, often accompanying and learning from Indians whose languages he learned. These wilderness skills led one of his aides to liken him to Daniel Boone, and more importantly, provided a strong foundation for his abilities to understand, navigate and use Civil War landscapes to Union advantage.

Crook was promoted to first lieutenant in 1856, and to captain in 1860. He was ordered east and in 1861, with the beginning of the American Civil War, was made colonel of the 36th Ohio Volunteer Infantry.

He married Mary Tapscott Dailey of Virginia.

==Civil War==

===Early service===

When the Civil War broke out, Crook accepted a commission as Colonel of the 36th Ohio Infantry and led it on duty in western Virginia. He was in command of the 3rd Brigade in the District of the Kanawha where he was wounded in a small fight at Lewisburg. Crook returned to command his regiment during the Northern Virginia Campaign. He and his regiment were part of John Pope&#x27;s headquarters escort at the Second Battle of Bull Run.

After the Union Army&#x27;s defeat at Second Bull Run, Crook and his regiment were attached to the Kanawha Division at the start of the Maryland Campaign. On September 12 Crook&#x27;s brigade commander, Augustus Moor, was captured and Crook assumed command of the 2nd Brigade, Kanawha Division which had been attached to the IX Corps. Crook led his brigade at the Battle of South Mountain and near Burnside&#x27;s Bridge at the Battle of Antietam. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on September 7, 1862. During these early battles he developed a lifelong friendship with one of his subordinates, Col. Rutherford B. Hayes of the 23rd Ohio Infantry.

Following Antietam, General Crook assumed command of the Kanawha Division. His division was detached from the IX Corps for duty in the Department of the Ohio. Before long Crook was assigned to command an infantry brigade in the Army of the Cumberland. This brigade became the 3rd Brigade, 4th Division, XIV Corps, which he led at the Battle of Hoover&#x27;s Gap. In July he assumed command of the 2nd Division, Cavalry Corps in the Army of the Cumberland. He fought at the battle of Chickamauga and was in pursuit of Joseph Wheeler during the Chattanooga Campaign.

In February 1864, Crook returned to command the Kanawha Division, which was now officially designated the 3rd Division of the Department of West Virginia.

===Southwest Virginia===
To open the spring campaign of 1864, Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant ordered a Union advance on all fronts, minor as well as major. Grant sent for Brigadier General Crook, in winter quarters at Charleston, West Virginia, and ordered him to attack the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, Richmond&#x27;s primary link to Knoxville and the southwest, and to destroy the Confederate salt works at Saltville, Virginia.

The 35-year-old Crook reported to army headquarters where the commanding general explained the mission in person. Grant instructed Crook to march his force, the Kanawha Division, against the railroad at Dublin, Virginia, south of Charleston. At Dublin he would put the railroad out of business and destroy Confederate military property. He was then to destroy the railroad bridge over New River, a few miles to the east. When these actions were accomplished, along with the destruction of the salt works, Crook was to march east and join forces with Major General Franz Sigel, who meanwhile was to be driving south up the Shenandoah Valley.

After long dreary months of garrison duty, the men were ready for action. Crook did not reveal the nature or objective of their mission, but everyone sensed that something important was brewing. &quot;All things point to early action&quot;, the commander of the second brigade, Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes, noted in his diary.

On April 29, 1864, the Kanawha Division marched out of Charleston and headed south. Crook sent a force under Brigadier General William W. Averell westward towards Saltville, then pushed on towards Dublin with nine infantry regiments, seven cavalry regiments, and 15 artillery pieces, a force of about 6,500 men organized into three brigades. The West Virginia countryside was beautiful that spring, but the mountainous terrain made the march a difficult undertaking. The way was narrow and steep, and spring rains slowed the march as tramping feet churned the roads into mud. In places, Crook&#x27;s engineers had to build bridges across wash-outs before the army could advance.

The column reached Fayette on May 2, and then passed through Raleigh Court House and Princeton. On the night of May 8, the division camped at Shannon&#x27;s Bridge, Virginia, north of Dublin.

The Confederates at Dublin soon learned the enemy was approaching. Their commander, Colonel John McCausland, prepared to evacuate his 1100 men, but before transportation could arrive, a courier from Brigadier General Albert G. Jenkins informed McCausland that the two of them were ordered by General John C. Breckinridge to stop Crook&#x27;s advance. The combined forces of Jenkins and McCausland amounted to 2,400 men. Jenkins, the senior officer, took command.

Breaking camp on the morning of May 9, Crook moved his men south to the top of a spur of Cloyd&#x27;s Mountain. Before the Union troops lay a precipitous, densely wooded slope with a meadow about 400 yards wide at the bottom. On the other side of the meadow, the land rose in another spur of the mountain, and there Jenkins&#x27; rebels waited behind hastily erected fortifications.

Crook dispatched the third brigade under Colonel Carr B. White to work its way through the woods and deliver a flank attack on the rebel right. At 11 am, he sent Hayes&#x27; first brigade and Colonel Horatio G. Sickel&#x27;s second brigade down the slope to the edge of the meadow, where they were to launch a frontal assault on the Confederates as soon as they heard the sound of White&#x27;s guns.

The slope before them was so steep that the officers had to dismount and descend on foot. Crook stationed himself with Hayes&#x27; brigade, which was to lead the assault. After a long, anxious wait, Hayes at last heard cannon fire off to his left and led his men at a slow double time out onto the meadow and into the rebels&#x27; musketry and artillery fire, which Crook called &quot;galling&quot;. Their pace quickened as they neared the other side, but just before the up-slope they came to a waist-deep creek. The barrier caused little delay and the Yankee infantry stormed up the hill and engaged the rebel defenders at close range.

The only man to have trouble with the creek was General Crook. Dismounted, he still wore his high riding boots, and as he stepped into the stream, the boots filled with water and bogged him down. Nearby soldiers grabbed their commander&#x27;s arms and hauled him to the other side.

Vicious hand-to-hand fighting erupted as the Yankees reached the crude rebel defenses. The Southerners gave way, tried to re-form, then broke and retreated up and over the hill towards Dublin.

The Yankees rounded up rebel prisoners by the hundreds and seized General Jenkins, who had fallen wounded. At this point the discipline of the Union men wavered, and there was no organized pursuit of the fleeing enemy. General Crook was unable to provide leadership as the excitement and exertion had sent him into a faint.

Colonel Hayes kept his head and organized a force of about 500 men from the soldiers milling about the site of their victory. With his improvised command, he set off, closely pressing the rebels.

While the fight at Cloyd&#x27;s Mountain was going on, a train pulled into the Dublin station and disgorged 500 fresh troops of General John Hunt Morgan&#x27;s cavalry, which had just diverted Averell away from Saltville. The fresh troops hastened towards the battlefield, where they soon met their compatriots retreating from Cloyd&#x27;s Mountain. The reinforcements halted the rout, but Colonel Hayes, although ignorant of the strength of the force now before him, immediately ordered his men to &quot;yell like devils&quot; and rush the enemy. Within a few minutes General Crook arrived with the rest of the division, and the defenders broke and ran.

Cloyd&#x27;s Mountain cost the Union army 688 casualties, while the rebels suffered 538 killed, wounded, and captured.

Unopposed, Crook moved his command into Dublin, where he laid waste to the railroad and the military stores. He then sent a party eastward to tear up the tracks and burn the ties. The next morning the main body set out for their next objective, the New River bridge, a key point on the railroad, a few miles to the east.

The Confederates, now commanded by Colonel McCausland, waited on the east side of the New River to defend the bridge. Crook pulled up on the west bank, and a long, ineffective artillery duel ensued. Seeing that there was little danger from the rebel cannon, Crook ordered the bridge destroyed, and both sides watched in awe as the structure collapsed magnificently into the river. McCausland, without the resources to oppose the Yankees any further, withdrew his battered command to the east.

General Crook, supplies running low in a country not suited for major foraging, now entertained second thoughts about his orders to push on east and join Sigel in the Shenandoah Valley. At Dublin he had intercepted an unconfirmed report that General Robert E. Lee had beaten Grant badly in the Wilderness, which led him to consider whether the Confederate commander might not soon move against Crook with a vastly superior force.

Having accomplished the major part of his mission, destruction of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, Crook turned his men north and after another hard march, reached the Union base at Meadow Bluff, West Virginia.

===Shenandoah Valley===
That July Crook assumed command of a small force called the Army of the Kanawha. Crook was defeated at the Second Battle of Kernstown. Nevertheless, he was appointed as a replacement for David Hunter in command of the Department of West Virginia the following day. However Crook did not assume command until August 9. Along with the title of his department Crook added &quot;Army of West Virginia.&quot; Crook&#x27;s army was soon absorbed into Philip H. Sheridan&#x27;s Army of the Shenandoah and for all practical purposes functioned as a corps in that unit. Although Crook&#x27;s force kept its official designation as the Army of West Virginia, it was often referred to as the VIII Corps. The official VIII Corps of the Union Army was led by Lew Wallace during this time and its troops were on duty in Maryland and Northern Virginia.

Crook led his corps in the Valley Campaigns of 1864 at the battles of Opequon (Third Winchester), Fisher&#x27;s Hill, and Cedar Creek. On October 21, 1864, he was promoted to major general of volunteers.

In February 1865 General Crook was captured by Confederate raiders at Cumberland, Maryland, and held as a prisoner of war in Richmond until exchanged a month later. He very briefly returned to command the Department of West Virginia until he took command of a cavalry division in the Army of the Potomac during the Appomattox Campaign. Crook first went into action with his division at the battle of Dinwiddie Court House. He later took a prominent role in the battles of Five Forks, Amelia Springs, Sayler&#x27;s Creek and Appomattox Court House.

==Indian Wars==
At the end of the Civil War, George Crook received a brevet as major general in the regular army, but reverted to the permanent rank of major. Only days later, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, serving with the 23rd Infantry on frontier duty in the Pacific Northwest. In 1867, he was appointed head of the Department of the Columbia.

===Snake War===

Crook successfully campaigned against the Snake Indians in the 1864–68 Snake War, where he won nationwide recognition. Crook had fought Indians in Oregon before the Civil War. He was assigned to the Pacific Northwest to use new tactics in this war, which had been waged for several years. Crook arrived in Boise to take command on December 11, 1866. The general noticed that the Northern Paiute used the fall, winter and spring seasons to gather food, so he adopted the tactic recommended by a predecessor George B. Currey to attack during the winter. Crook had his cavalry approach the Paiute on foot in attack at their winter camp. As the soldiers drew them in, Crook had them remount; they defeated the Paiute and recovered some stolen livestock.

Crook used Indian scouts as troops as well as to spot enemy encampments. While campaigning in Eastern Oregon during the winter of 1867, Crook&#x27;s scouts located a Paiute village near the eastern edge of Steens Mountain. After covering all the escape routes, Crook ordered the charge on the village while intending to view the raid from afar, but his horse got spooked and galloped ahead of Crook&#x27;s forces toward the village. Caught in the crossfire, Crook&#x27;s horse carried the general through the village without being wounded. The army caused heavy casualties for the Paiute in the battle of Tearass Plain. Crook later defeated a mixed band of Paiute, Pit River, and Modoc at the Battle of Infernal Caverns in Fall River Mills, California.

===Yavapai War===
President Ulysses S. Grant next placed Crook in command of the Arizona Territory. Crook&#x27;s use of Apache scouts during his Tonto Basin Campaign of the Yavapai War brought him much success in forcing the Yavapai and Tonto Apache onto reservations. Crook&#x27;s victories during the Yavapai War included the Battle of Salt River Canyon, also known as the Skeleton Cave Massacre, and the Battle of Turret Peak.
In 1873, Crook was appointed brigadier general in the regular army, a promotion that passed over and angered several full colonels next in line.

===Great Sioux War===

From 1875 to 1882 and again from 1886 to 1888, Crook was head of the Department of the Platte, with headquarters at Fort Omaha in North Omaha, Nebraska.

====Battle of the Rosebud====

On 28 May 1876, Crook assumed direct command of the Bighorn and Yellowstone Expedition at Fort Fetterman. Crook had gathered a strong force from his Department of the Platte. Leaving Fort Fetterman on 29 May, the 1,051-man column consisted of 15 companies from the 2d and 3d Cavalry, 5 companies from the 4th and 9th Infantry, 250 mules, and 106 wagons. On 14 June, the column was joined by 261 Shoshone and Crow allies. Based on intelligence reports, Crook ordered his entire force to prepare for a quick march. Each man was to carry only 1 blanket, 100 rounds of ammunition, and 4 days&#x27; rations. The wagon train would be left at Goose Creek, and the infantry would be mounted on the pack mules.

On 17 June, Crook&#x27;s column set out at 0600, marching northward along the south fork of Rosebud Creek. The Crow and Shoshone scouts were particularly apprehensive. Although the column had not yet encountered any sign of Indians, the scouts seemed to sense their presence. The soldiers, particularly the mule-riding infantry, seemed fatigued from the early start and the previous day&#x27;s march. Accordingly, Crook stopped to rest his men and animals at 0800. Although he was deep in hostile territory, Crook made no special dispositions for defense. His troops halted in their marching order. The Cavalry battalions led the column, followed by the battalion of mule-borne foot soldiers, and a provisional company of civilian miners and packers brought up the rear.

The Crow and Shoshone scouts remained alert while the soldiers rested. Several minutes later, the soldiers heard the sound of intermittent gunfire coming from the bluffs to the north. As the intensity of fire increased, a scout rushed into the camp shouting, &quot;Lakota, Lakota!&quot; The Battle of the Rosebud was on. By 0830, the Sioux and Cheyenne had hotly engaged Crook&#x27;s Indian allies on the high ground north of the main body. Heavily outnumbered, the Crow and Shoshone scouts fell back toward the camp, but their fighting withdrawal gave Crook time to deploy his forces. Rapidly firing soldiers drove off the attackers but used up much of the ammunition meant for use later in the campaign. Low on ammunition and with numerous wounded, the General returned to his post.

Historians debate whether Crook&#x27;s pressing on could have prevented the killing of the five companies of the 7th Cavalry Regiment led by George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.

====Battle of Slim Buttes====
After the disaster at the Little Bighorn, the U.S. Congress authorized funds to reinforce the Big Horn and Yellowstone Expedition. Determined to demonstrate the willingness and capability of the U.S. Army to pursue and punish the Sioux, Crook took to the field. After briefly linking up with General Alfred Terry, military commander of the Dakota Territory, Crook embarked on what came to be known as the grueling and poorly provisioned Horsemeat March, upon which the soldiers were reduced to eating their horses and mules. A party dispatched to Deadwood for supplies came across the village of American Horse the Elder on September 9, 1876. The well-stocked village was attacked and looted in the Battle of Slim Buttes. Crazy Horse led a counter-attack against Crook the next day, but was repulsed by Crook&#x27;s superior numbers.

===&quot;Standing Bear v. Crook&quot;===

In 1879, Crook spoke on behalf of the Ponca tribe and Native American rights during the trial of &quot;Standing Bear v. Crook.&quot; The federal judge affirmed that Standing Bear had some of the rights of U.S. citizens.

That same year his home at Fort Omaha, now called the General Crook House and considered part of North Omaha, was completed.

===Geronimo&#x27;s War===
Crook was made head of the Department of Arizona and successfully forced some members of the Apache to surrender, but Geronimo continually evaded capture. As a mark of respect, the Apache nicknamed Crook &quot;Nantan Lupan&quot;, which means &quot;Chief Wolf&quot;. In March, 1886, Crook received word that Geronimo would meet him in Cañon de los Embudos, in the Sierra Madre Mountains about from Fort Bowie. During the three days of negotiations, photographer C. S. Fly took about 15 exposures of the Apache on glass negatives. One of the pictures of Geronimo with two of his sons standing alongside was made at Geronimo&#x27;s request. Fly&#x27;s images are the only existing photographs of Geronimo&#x27;s surrender. His photos of Geronimo and the other free Apaches, taken on March 25 and 26, are the only known photographs taken of an American Indian while still at war with the United States.
Geronimo, camped on the Mexican side of the border, agreed to Crook&#x27;s surrender terms. That night, a soldier who sold them whiskey said that his band would be murdered as soon as they crossed the border. Geronimo and 25 of his followers slipped away during the night; their escape cost Crook his command.

Nelson A. Miles replaced Crook in 1886 in command of the Arizona Territory and brought an end to the Apache Wars. He captured Geronimo and the Chiricahua Apache band, and detained the Chiricahua scouts, who had served the U.S. Army, transporting them all as prisoners-of-war to a prison in Florida. (Crook was reportedly furious that the scouts, who had faithfully served the Army, were imprisoned along with the hostile warriors. He sent numerous telegrams protesting their arrest to Washington. They, along with most of Geronimo&#x27;s band, were forced to spend the next 26 years in captivity at the fort in Florida before they were finally released.) 

After years of campaigning in the Indian Wars, Crook won steady promotion back up the ranks to the permanent grade of Major General. President Grover Cleveland placed him in command of the Military Division of the Missouri in 1888.

==Later life==
Crook served in Omaha again as the Commander of the Department of the Platte from 1886 to 1888. While he was there, his portrait was painted by artist Herbert A. Collins.

Crook spent his last years speaking out against the unjust treatment of his former Indian adversaries. He died suddenly in Chicago in 1890 while serving as commander of the Military Division of the Missouri. Crook was originally buried in Oakland, Maryland. In 1890, Crook&#x27;s remains were transported to Arlington National Cemetery, where he was reinterred on November 11.

Red Cloud, a war chief of the Oglala Lakota (Sioux), said of Crook, &quot;He, at least, never lied to us. His words gave us hope.&quot;

==Legacy==

His good friend and Union Army subordinate, future President Rutherford B. Hayes, named one of his sons George Crook Hayes (1864–1866), in honor of his commanding officer. The little boy died before his second birthday of scarlet fever.

Crook Counties in Wyoming and Oregon were named for him, as was the town of Crook, Colorado.

&quot;Crook City,&quot; an unincorporated place in the Black Hills of South Dakota, was named for his 1876 camp there. Nearby and between Deadwood and Sturgis, South Dakota is Crook Mountain, named for him. Crook City Road passes through there from Whitewood heading toward Deadwood.

Crook Peak in Lake County, Oregon, elevation , in the Warner Mountains is named after him. It is near where the general set up Camp Warner (1867–1874) in a campaign to subdue the Paiute Indians.

Crook Mountain in Chelan County, Washington, elevation , a peak in the North Cascades, was named for him.

Cañon Pintado Historic District, south of Rangely, Colorado, has numerous ancient Fremont culture (0–1300 CE) and Ute petroglyphs, first seen by Europeans in the mid-18th century. One group of carvings, believed to be Ute after adoption of the horse in the 1600s, has several horses, which locals call &quot;Crook&#x27;s Brand Site&quot;. They claim the horses carry the general&#x27;s brand.

Forest Road 300 in the Coconino National Forest is named the &quot;General Crook Trail.&quot; It is a section of the trail which his troops blazed from Fort Verde to Fort Whipple, and on to Fort Apache through central Arizona.

Numerous military references honor him: Fort Crook (1857–1869) was an Army post near Fall River Mills, California, used during the Indian Wars. Later during the Civil War, it was used for the defense of San Francisco. It was named for then Lt. Crook by Captain John W. T. Gardiner, 1st Dragoons, as Crook was recovering there from an injury. California State Historical Marker 355 marks the site in Shasta County.

Fort Crook (1891–1946) was an Army Depot in Bellevue, Nebraska, first used as a dispatch point for Indian conflicts on the Great Plains. Later it served as airfield for the 61st Balloon Company of the Army Air Corps. It was named for Brig. Gen. Crook due to his many successful Indian campaigns in the west. The site formerly known as Fort Crook is now part of Offutt AFB, Nebraska.

3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division is nicknamed &quot;Greywolf&quot; in his honor, in a variation of his Apache nickname meaning &quot;Chief Wolf&quot;.

The General Crook House at Fort Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska is named in his honor, as he was the only Commander of the Department of the Platte to live there. At Fort Huachuca, Crook House on Old Post is named after him as well. The Crook Walk in Arlington National Cemetery is near General Crook&#x27;s gravesite.

<doc id="332305" wikidata="Q1147732" url="?curid=332305" title="Oakland Coliseum">
<text>Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, often shortened to the Oakland Coliseum, is a multi-purpose stadium in Oakland, California. The stadium serves as part of the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Complex, located next to Oakland Arena. In 2017, the playing surface was dedicated as Rickey Henderson Field in honor of Major League Baseball Hall of Famer and former Athletics left fielder Rickey Henderson.

It was the home of the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball from 1968 to 2024. It was also the home of the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League from 1966 until 1981, when the team moved to Los Angeles, and again after the team’s return, from 1995 until 2019, when the team moved to Las Vegas. For the last years of top-flight professional sports at the stadium, it was primarily used for baseball. It was the last remaining stadium in the United States shared by professional baseball and football teams. It has occasionally been used for soccer, currently being host to second-division soccer league USL Championship&#x27;s Oakland Roots SC, and has previously hosted select San Jose Earthquakes matches in 2008 and 2009. Additionally, it was used for international matches during the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

The Coliseum has a seating capacity of up to 63,132 depending on its configuration; an upper deck dubbed &quot;Mount Davis&quot; by fans was added as part of a 1996 renovation for the Raiders&#x27; return to Oakland. In 2006, citing a desire to provide a more &quot;intimate&quot; environment, the Athletics blocked off the entirety of the Coliseum&#x27;s third deck during its games, which artificially limited its capacity to 34,077 (making it the smallest stadium in Major League Baseball). On April 11, 2017, with Dave Kaval as the team president, the Athletics began to reopen some of the sections in the third deck, and open the Mount Davis deck for selected marquee games; this configuration makes it, by contrast, the largest baseball stadium in the United States by capacity through 2024.

The current state of Oakland Coliseum has been widely criticized; fans and players alike consider the Coliseum to be poorly maintained and out of date. During its tenure as an MLB stadium, along with Tropicana Field, it was often cited as one of the worst ballparks in MLB and consistently took the last or second-to-last spot in rankings of stadiums. Major League Baseball has cited the need to replace Oakland Coliseum and Tropicana Field as one of the primary obstacles to future expansion.

The Athletics are currently in the process of relocating to Las Vegas and vacated the Coliseum following the expiration of their lease at the conclusion of the 2024 season and move into West Sacramento&#x27;s Sutter Health Park for three seasons as a dedicated facility in Las Vegas is built.

==Stadium history==
===Planning and construction===
Business and political leaders in Oakland had long been in competition with neighboring San Francisco, as well as other cities in the West, and worked for Oakland and its greater East Bay suburbs to be recognized nationally as a viable metropolitan area with its own identity and reputation, distinct and separate from that of San Francisco. Professional sports was seen as a primary way for the East Bay to gain such recognition. As a result, the desire for a major league stadium in the city of Oakland intensified during the 1950s and 1960s.

By 1960, a non-profit corporation was formed to oversee the financing and development of the facility rather than city or county government issuing taxpayer-backed bonds for construction. Local real estate developer Robert T. Nahas (who had been president of Oakland&#x27;s chamber of commerce) headed this group, which included other prominent East Bay business leaders such as former US Senator William Knowland and Edgar F. Kaiser, and which later became the governing board of the Coliseum upon completion. It was Nahas&#x27; idea that the Coliseum be privately financed with ownership transferring to the city and county upon retirement of the construction financing.

Nahas served 20 years as President of the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Board. On the death of Nahas, Jack Maltester, a former San Leandro mayor and Coliseum board member, said, &quot;If not for Bob Nahas, there would be no Coliseum, it&#x27;s really that simple.&quot; Nahas had to be a diplomat dealing with the egos of Raiders owner Al Davis, Athletics owner Charles O. Finley, and Warriors owner Franklin Mieuli.

Preliminary architectural plans were unveiled in November 1960, and the following month a site was chosen west of the Elmhurst district of East Oakland alongside the recently completed Nimitz Freeway. A downtown site adjacent to Lake Merritt and the Oakland Auditorium was also originally considered. The Port of Oakland played a key role in selection of the East Oakland site. The Port gave at the head of San Leandro Bay to the East Bay Regional Park District, in exchange for of park land across the freeway. The Port then donated that land to the City of Oakland as the site for the complex.

The Oakland Raiders of the American Football League (AFL) moved to Frank Youell Field, a makeshift stadium near downtown Oakland, for their third season in 1962, and the Coliseum was already being heralded in the local media as the Raiders&#x27; future permanent home. Baseball was also a major factor in the planning of the Coliseum. As early as 1961, the American League publicly indicated that it wished to include Oakland in its West Coast expansion plans. In , American League president Joe Cronin suggested that Coliseum officials model some aspects of the new ballpark after the recently completed Dodger Stadium, which impressed him, though these expansion plans seemed to fade by the middle of the decade.

After approval from the city of Oakland as well as Alameda County by 1962, $25 million in financing was arranged. Plans were drawn for a stadium, an indoor arena, and an exhibition hall in between them. The architect of record was the San Francisco office of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill with Myron Goldsmith the principal design architect and the general contractor was Guy F. Atkinson Company. Preliminary site preparation began in the summer of 1961, and construction started the following spring. The construction schedule was delayed for two years due to various legal issues and cost overruns; the original design had to be modified slightly to stay within budget.

In , it was rumored that the Cleveland Indians might leave for a West Coast city (such as Oakland), but the Indians stayed in Cleveland. Charlie Finley, owner of the Kansas City Athletics, unhappy in Kansas City at its municipal stadium, was impressed by Oakland&#x27;s new venue and Nahas personally convinced him to consider moving the A&#x27;s to Oakland. After several unsuccessful attempts and amid considerable controversy, Finley eventually got permission to relocate the Athletics to Oakland prior to the 1968 season. The expansion Kansas City Royals, the A&#x27;s replacement, debuted the next year.

===Stadium name changes===
For over three decades (1966–1998), the stadium was first known as Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum.

In September 1997, UMAX Technologies agreed to acquire the naming rights to the stadium. However, following a dispute, a court decision reinstated the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum name. In 1998, Network Associates agreed to pay US$5.8 million over five years for the naming rights and the stadium became known as Network Associates Coliseum, or, alternately in marketing and media usage as, &quot;the Net&quot;.

Network Associates renewed the contract in 2003 for an additional five years at a cost of $6 million. In mid-2004, Network Associates was renamed McAfee, restoring its name from before its 1997 merger with Network General, and the stadium was renamed McAfee Coliseum accordingly.

McAfee was offered a renewal of the naming contract in 2008, but it was declined. The name reverted to the pre-1997 name of Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum on September 19, 2008. The stadium retained its original name until April 27, 2011, when it was renamed Overstock.com Coliseum via a six-year, $7.2 million naming rights deal with online retailer Overstock.com.

The Coliseum was renamed O.co Coliseum on June 6, 2011, after Overstock.com&#x27;s marketing name. However, due to a contract dispute with the Athletics regarding the Overstock/O.co naming rights deal, the A&#x27;s continued to refer to the stadium as the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum in all official team communications and on team websites.

Overstock opted out of the final year on their naming rights deal on April 2, 2016, and the stadium once again became the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum.

The Athletics dedicated the Coliseum&#x27;s playing surface &quot;Rickey Henderson Field&quot; in honor of MLB Hall of Famer and former Athletic Rickey Henderson as part of Opening Day on April 3, 2017.

RingCentral placed a bid for the naming rights on May 14, 2019, for a $1 million annual payment. The Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Authority gave its approval of the new naming-rights deal on May 31, 2019, pending formal approval from Major League Baseball. New signage was in place by the time that the Golden State Warriors hosted the 2019 NBA Finals at the neighboring Oracle Arena on June 5.

In August 2019, the head of the Coliseum Authority, Scott McKibben, abruptly resigned his position after allegations emerged that he had requested a $50,000 fee from RingCentral in exchange for negotiating the naming rights deal. McKibben was subsequently charged by the Alameda County district attorney&#x27;s office with violating conflict-of-interest laws, including one felony and one misdemeanor count, ultimately pleading nolo contendere to the misdemeanor in exchange for the dropping of the felony charge. On January 17, 2020, the RingCentral naming rights deal was rescinded by the Coliseum Authority. In late 2020, a new three year naming rights deal with RingCentral was agreed to.

On April 1, 2023, the Coliseum terminated its sponsorship with RingCentral, reverting to its original name.

==Design==
The Coliseum features an underground design where the playing surface is not only below ground level, it is below sea level. Consequently, fans entering the stadium find themselves walking on to the main concourse of the stadium at the top of the first level of seats. This, combined with the hill that was built around the stadium to create the upper concourse, means that only the third deck is visible from outside the park.

===Configurations===
In its baseball configuration, the Coliseum has the most foul territory of any ballpark in Major League Baseball. Thus, many balls that would reach the seats in other ballparks can be caught for outs at the Coliseum. The distance to the backstop was initially , but was reduced to in 1969.

From 1968 through 1981 and in 1995, two football configurations were used at the stadium. During Raider preseason games and all regular season games played while the baseball season was still going on, the field was set up from home plate to center field (east/west). Seats that were down the foul lines for baseball games became the sideline seats for football games, which started up to away from the field (most football-only stadiums have sideline seats that start half that distance away). Once the A&#x27;s season ended, the orientation was switched to north–south: i.e. the football field ran from the left field line to the right field line; seats were moved from behind first and third base to create corners for the end zone to fit into (these seats were then placed to fill in the space that was normally behind home plate and near the foul poles for baseball games). Temporary football bleachers were then added in front of the baseball bleachers to form the sideline on the east (visitors&#x27;) side, and the baseball bleachers were not sold. Raiders season ticket holders would thus have two season ticket locations in different parts of the stadium that roughly corresponded to the same location in relation to the field. After stadium expansion in 1996, the field ran north–south throughout the season.

===Seating capacity===


==Eventual replacements==
=== Athletics ===

Athletics owner Lewis Wolff made the first official proposal for a new ballpark in Oakland to the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Authority on August 12, 2005. The new stadium would have been located across 66th Avenue from the Coliseum in what is currently an industrial area north of the Coliseum. The park would have held 35,000 fans, making it the smallest park in the major leagues. Plans for the Oakland location fell through in early 2006 when several of the owners of the land proposed for the new ballpark decided not to sell.

Throughout 2006, the Athletics continued to search for a ballpark site within their designated territory of Alameda County. Late in 2006, rumors began to circulate regarding a parcel of land in Fremont being the new site. These rumors were confirmed by the Fremont city council on November8 of that year. Wolff met with the council that day to present his plan to move the A&#x27;s to Fremont into a soon to be built ballpark named Cisco Field. Wolff and Cisco Systems conducted a press conference at the San Jose-based headquarters of Cisco Systems on November 14, 2006, to confirm the deal, and showcase some details of the future plan. However, on February 24, 2009, after delays and increased public opposition, the Athletics officially ended their search for a stadium site in Fremont. The Athletics later took their Cisco Field plan to a site in downtown San Jose located near SAP Center (home of the NHL&#x27;s San Jose Sharks). The San Jose plan was opposed by the San Francisco Giants whose territory San Jose is in and on October 5, 2015, the United States Supreme Court rejected San Jose&#x27;s bid on the Athletics.

During that time, the City of Oakland continued to propose new ballpark ideas that ranged from a proposal to build on a waterfront site in the Jack London Square area called Victory Court to a three stadium proposal called &quot;Coliseum City&quot; on the Coliseum site. Both plans went nowhere.

The Athletics signed a ten-year lease to stay in Oakland and at the Coliseum on July 22, 2014. The deal required that the team look into a new stadium, but only in the city limits, which made it more difficult for the Raiders to tear the Coliseum down for a football-only facility. The A&#x27;s began talks with an architect on August 6, 2014, to build a baseball-only stadium at the Coliseum site, according to Wolff.

Going into 2016, John J. Fisher took majority control of the team and made Dave Kaval team president and the person in charge of the stadium hunt. On September 12, 2017, it was announced that a site near Laney College and the Eastlake neighborhood had been chosen for the new ballpark (tentatively called Oakland Ballpark) with the A&#x27;s proposing to construct a 35,000-seat stadium on the site of the college&#x27;s administrative buildings which the A&#x27;s would relocate to a spot of the college&#x27;s choosing. However, the Laney College Board of Trustees abruptly ended talks with the Athletics in December 2017. The surprised A&#x27;s were forced to look at alternatives for a new stadium location.

On November 28, 2018, the Athletics announced that the team had chosen to build its 34,000-seat new ballpark at the Howard Terminal site, located about two miles west of Laney College at the Port of Oakland. The team also announced its intent to purchase the Coliseum site and make that into a technology and housing hub, preserving Oracle Arena and reducing the Coliseum to a low-rise sports park as San Francisco did with Kezar Stadium.

A turning point came in spring of 2021, when Commissioner Rob Manfred suggested that the A&#x27;s look into relocation to another city after the Howard Terminal plans stalled. However, the A&#x27;s said that they remained committed to staying in Oakland, and continued their efforts to get the new ballpark at Howard Terminal built. At the same time, the team eyed a possible move to Las Vegas if they could not get a new ballpark built at Howard Terminal with team representatives, Kaval and Fisher organizing multiple trips to the area to speak with local officials and business magnates and selecting the Tropicana Las Vegas hotel and resort as the site for a new venue should they relocate. The team previously played six games at Las Vegas&#x27; Cashman Field when renovations for the Coliseum were not yet complete. On April 19, 2023, the A&#x27;s announced that they had agreed to purchase land from Red Rock Casino, Resort &amp; Spa in the Las Vegas Strip for a new stadium estimated to be complete by 2027 with the backing of many within the state of Nevada and the MLB. By May 9, the Athletics&#x27; proposal was changed to the Tropicana Las Vegas instead. On June 15, Governor Joe Lombardo signed the Athletics&#x27; proposal into law through SB1 after it was passed in the Nevada State Legislature. Shortly after the bill&#x27;s approval, the Athletics announced they would begin the relocation process to Las Vegas with the MLB which happened a week later. By November 16, the Athletics&#x27; move to Las Vegas was unanimously approved by the MLB during an owners meeting in Arlington, Texas.

On April 4, the A&#x27;s announced 2024 would be their final season in Oakland with home games played in Sutter Health Park, the home of the AAA Sacramento River Cats, starting in 2025.

=== Raiders ===

Under any such replacement proposals, the Oakland Raiders would have presumably continued to play football in the Coliseum, although there were proposals for the Raiders to play at Levi&#x27;s Stadium, the home of the San Francisco 49ers in Santa Clara as well as rumors regarding the Raiders&#x27; possible return to Los Angeles.

The Raiders proposed a 50,000-seat stadium in the same spot of the Coliseum in 2013. It would have cost $800 million, with $300 million coming from the Raiders, $200 million coming from the NFL&#x27;s stadium loan program, and the final $300 million coming from the city. After the failure of the stadium plan, Raiders owner Mark Davis met with officials with the city of San Antonio on July 29, 2014, to discuss moving the Raiders to the city in time for the 2015 season; they would have temporarily played home games at the Alamodome until a new permanent stadium was built.

On September 3, 2014, the city of Oakland claimed it had reached a tentative deal to build a new football stadium in Oakland, which would have resulted in the Coliseum being demolished. The claim was met with silence from the Raiders, who continued to explore San Antonio, and opposition from Alameda County.

On February 19, 2015, the Raiders and the San Diego Chargers announced plans for a privately financed $1.7 billion stadium that the two teams would have built in Carson upon being approved to move to the Los Angeles market. Both teams said they would continue to attempt to get stadiums built in their respective cities. The stadium was approved by the Carson City Council but was defeated by the NFL who voted in favor of building Inglewood&#x27;s SoFi Stadium and relocating the St. Louis Rams back to Los Angeles with the Chargers as the second L.A. team thus shutting out the Raiders from the Southern California market.

In January 2016, Mark Davis met with Las Vegas Sands owner Sheldon Adelson about building a domed stadium on the UNLV campus for the Raiders and the UNLV Rebels. The stadium location for what became known as Allegiant Stadium was later moved to a site across Interstate 15 from Mandalay Bay. After the approval of $750 million from the state of Nevada and backing from Bank of America after Adelson pulled out of the project, the Raiders submitted papers for relocation to Las Vegas in January 2017, and on March 27, the Raiders&#x27; relocation to Las Vegas was approved. The team planned to continue to play at the Coliseum through the 2019 NFL season and relocate to Las Vegas in 2020. In December 2018, the city of Oakland sued the Raiders and all the other NFL teams for millions in unpaid debts and financial damages, which prompted Raiders management to declare that the team was leaving after the 2018 season. After the 49ers blocked an attempt by the Raiders to relocate to Oracle Park for the 2019 season, the Raiders and Coliseum Authority reached an agreement in principle on February 25, 2019, to allow the Raiders to return to the Coliseum for 2019 with a provision for 2020 in case completion of Allegiant Stadium was delayed; the Coliseum Authority approved the lease on March 15 while the Alameda County Board of Supervisors and Oakland City Council voted in favor of the lease on March 19 and 21, respectively. On January 22, 2020, the Raiders officially moved to Las Vegas becoming the Las Vegas Raiders.

=== Roots and Soul===
In March 2024, the Oakland Roots and Oakland Soul soccer teams (of the USL Championship and USL Super League, respectively) announced their intention to move into the Coliseum for their 2025 and 2026 seasons while a soccer-specific stadium is constructed, which was previously planned to be built in the Oakland Coliseum complex, before the team began focusing on the Howard Terminal site. The Roots use 15,000 seats for most home matches in 2025, with the grass field aligned to the third base line. In addition, the Roots and Soul have continued to honor the field as Rickey Henderson Field following the namesake&#x27;s death in late 2024.

== Coliseum redevelopment plan ==
The Coliseum, along with Oracle Arena and its surrounding parking lots, were owned 50% by the City of Oakland and 50% by the Athletics. The Athletics purchased their 50% share in 2018 from Alameda County, after the City of Oakland dropped a lawsuit that attempted to block the sale. As of July 2021, two Black-led redevelopment groups were vying for the chance to purchase the city&#x27;s half of the site, one led by the African American Sports and Entertainment Group and the other by Dave Stewart and Lonnie Murray. In November 2021, the council voted to move forward with the plan proposed by the African American Sports and Entertainment Group. On May 23, 2024, the city of Oakland announced its plan to sell its one-half share in the existing for a minimum of $105 million to the African American Sports &amp; Entertainment Group, whose plans for the site include residential and commercial uses.

==Notable events==
=== Raiders and A&#x27;s move in ===
The Raiders played their first game at the stadium on September 18, 1966. In 1968, the Kansas City Athletics moved to Oakland and began play at the stadium. The Athletics&#x27; first game was played on April 17, 1968. The stadium complex cost $25.5 million ($ adjusted for inflation) to build and rests on of land. On April 17, 1968, Boog Powell hit the first major league home run in the history of the Coliseum. On May8 of that year, Catfish Hunter pitched the ninth perfect game in Major League history at the Coliseum. The Coliseum hosted the 1967 and 1969 AFL championship games. Additionally, the venue had hosted the second match of the NPSL Final 1967.

A Rolling Stones concert performed here in 1969 became the early bootleg &quot;Live&#x27;r Than You&#x27;ll Ever Be&quot;.

===1970s===
From 1970 to 1972 the stadium hosted three college football benefit games featuring Bay Area schools versus historically black colleges.

The Coliseum hosted the 1971 East–West Shrine Game on January 2, 1971. In 1972, the Athletics won their first of three straight World Series championships and their first since their years in Philadelphia.

The awkwardness of the baseball–football conversion, as well as the low seating capacity (around 54,000 for football) and that the prime seating on the east side consisted of temporary bleachers led the Raiders to explore other stadium options. One such option was Memorial Stadium on the UC Berkeley campus. Several preseason games were played there in the early 1970s along with one regular season game in 1973 (a 12–7 victory over the Miami Dolphins during September while the A&#x27;s regular season was going on). However, in response to traffic and parking issues associated with these games (while Cal games drew a large number of students who live on or near campus and walk to the games, Raiders games attracted fans from a larger geographic area who were used to tailgating at the Coliseum and were more likely to drive to games), the City of Berkeley passed a Professional Sports Events License Tax in which the city collected 10% of all gate receipts, making the staging of professional games inside the city cost-prohibitive. The Raiders were granted an injunction from the city collecting the tax, arguing that the tax was a regulatory measure rather than a revenue measure, and was therefore an improper regulation on land held in trust by the Regents of the University of California. However, the grant of the injunction was reversed by the California Court of Appeals, who found it to be a revenue measure, despite the fact that the city had made the measure immediately effective &quot;due to danger to the public peace, health, and safety of the City of Berkeley as a result of the holding of professional sports events there&quot;.

The stadium was not well maintained for most of the late 1970s. Its condition was most noticeable during baseball season, when crowds for A&#x27;s games twice numbered fewer than 1,000. On April 17, 1979, only 653 fans attended the game versus the Seattle Mariners. During this time, it was popularly known as the &quot;Oakland Mausoleum&quot;.

===1980s===

In 1980, the Raiders won Super Bowl XV. Two years later, the Raiders moved to Los Angeles, leaving the A&#x27;s as the only remaining tenants of Oakland Coliseum. Only days later, Finley agreed to sell the A&#x27;s to Marvin Davis, who planned to move the A&#x27;s to Denver. However, city and county officials were not about to lose Oakland&#x27;s status as a major league city in its own right, and refused to let the A&#x27;s out of their lease. Finley sold the team instead to the owners of San Francisco-based Levi Strauss &amp; Co. After the 1986 Major League Baseball season, the original scoreboards were replaced. A new American Sign and Indicator scoreboard and message center was installed behind the left field bleachers, while the original right field scoreboard was replaced with a manually operated out-of-town scoreboard. Between the centerfield flagpoles, a new Diamond Vision video screen was installed.

The 1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held at the stadium. From 1988 to 1990, the venue saw three more World Series. In 1989, the Athletics won their 4th Series since moving to Oakland, sweeping the San Francisco Giants in the earthquake-interrupted &quot;Battle of the Bay&quot; Series.

===1990s===
In July 1995, the Raiders agreed to return to Oakland provided that Oakland Coliseum underwent renovations. In November 1995, those renovations commenced and continued through the next summer until the beginning of the 1996 football season (more info below). The new layout also had the somewhat peculiar effect of creating an inward jog in the outfield fence, in left center and right center. There are now three distance markers instead of one, at various points of the power alleys, as indicated in the dimensions grid. The Raiders&#x27; return also heralded the creation of the &quot;Black Hole&quot;, a highly recognizable group of fans who occupied one end zone seating during football games.

===2000s===
On April 2, 2006, the broadcast booth was renamed in honor of the late Bill King, a legendary Bay Area sportscaster who was the play-by-play voice of the A&#x27;s, Raiders and Warriors for 44 years.

San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer, announced in November 2007 that they would be playing their &quot;big draw&quot; games, such as those featuring David Beckham and the Los Angeles Galaxy, at the stadium instead of their then-home Buck Shaw Stadium (capacity roughly 10,000) in Santa Clara. Since then the Quakes moved to their new home of PayPal Park and play their bigger games in nearby Stanford Stadium.

Midway through the decade, the stadium established a &quot;no re-entry&quot; policy. Each ticket can be used only once, after which a second ticket must be purchased in order to re-enter the Coliseum.

===2010s===
On May 9, 2010, almost 42 years to the day of Catfish Hunter&#x27;s perfect game, Dallas Braden pitched the 19th perfect game in Major League history at the Coliseum. A commemorative graphic was placed on the baseball outfield wall next to Rickey Henderson&#x27;s retired number on May 17, their next home game.

With the Miami Marlins opening their own ballpark in 2012, the stadium became the last remaining venue in the United States that hosted both a Major League Baseball and a National Football League team.

As part of a new ten-year lease signed by the Athletics with the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Authority in 2014, the Oakland Coliseum had a new $10 million scoreboard system (two large outfield scoreboards, 36 feet tall and 145 feet wide, and two ribbon scoreboards) installed for the start of the 2015 MLB season. Also part of the new lease, the Coliseum Authority agreed to pay $1million a year, with five percent annual increases, into a fund to maintain the stadium.

For the 2017 Major League Baseball season, the tarp covering a large amount of the baseball configuration has been removed, increasing the capacity to over 47,000 for the first time since 1995. The tarp remains on the football-only Mt. Davis.

From 2016 onward, the A&#x27;s have invested heavily in improvements to the Coliseum. In 2017 the team created a new outdoor plaza area with food trucks and lawn games, called Championship Plaza. The West Side Club was also entirely renovated and rebranded into Shibe Park Tavern (after their former home park in Philadelphia), the Coliseum&#x27;s new destination restaurant and bar with more than twenty different beers on tap. In 2018, the A&#x27;s created a brand new destination indoor/outdoor bar concept in the left field corner called The Treehouse. The Treehouse has brought a new demographic of fans to the Coliseum through nightly themed discounts and through its innovative subscription ticketing product, the Treehouse Pass.

On April 17, 2018, the Athletics opened the gates to the Coliseum for a free admission game versus the Chicago White Sox. It was the 50th anniversary of the club&#x27;s first game played in Oakland back on April 17, 1968. 46,028 fans were on hand for the 10–2 Athletics victory and Kaval called the game &quot;a gift to Oakland&quot;.

On December 15, 2019, the Raiders played their last scheduled game at the Coliseum, losing to the Jacksonville Jaguars by a score of 20–16, giving up 17 unanswered points in the second half. Fans booed the team as they exited the field for the last time.

=== 2020s ===
On September 6, 2020, the San Diego Padres and the Athletics played in the warmest game in the Coliseum&#x27;s history. The game was played in 94-degree heat.

On June 13, 2023, Oakland A&#x27;s fans organized a &quot;Reverse Boycott&quot; protest against the ownership&#x27;s poor management of the team and attempts to relocate the franchise to Las Vegas. The attendance was 27,759 as the A&#x27;s won 2–1 against the Tampa Bay Rays. Fans chanted protests such as &quot;Sell the Team&quot;, &quot;Fisher Sucks&quot;, and &quot;Stay in Oakland&quot;.

On June 28, 2023, Domingo Germán of the New York Yankees threw the 24th perfect game in Major League Baseball history, defeating the Oakland Athletics 11–0 at the Coliseum. It was the third perfect game in Coliseum history after Dallas Braden in 2010 and Catfish Hunter in 1968.

The Athletics played their final game at both the Coliseum and in Oakland on September 26, 2024, winning 3–2 against the Texas Rangers in front of a sellout crowd of 46,889 fans. The team plans to relocate to Sutter Health Park in the Sacramento area temporarily for the 2025 through 2027 seasons, with an option for the 2028 season, until their new permanent home in Las Vegas is completed.

===Concerts===
Commencing in 1973, the stadium hosted an annual Day on the Green concert series, presented by Bill Graham and his company Bill Graham Presents, which continued on into the early 1990s.

In January 1974, singer Marvin Gaye used the stadium as the site for his comeback to the performance stage. His acclaimed performance was later released for the live album, &quot;Marvin Gaye Live!&quot;.

Led Zeppelin played what turned out to be their final North American concerts with twin shows during their 1977 North American Tour. Following the second show Bill Graham barred the band from the venue and his other managed venues in response to the band&#x27;s manager Peter Grant, drummer John Bonham and security &#x27;coordinator&#x27; John Bindon&#x27;s brutal assault on one of Graham&#x27;s security employees during the first show, following the employee&#x27;s refusal to allow Grant&#x27;s 11-year-old son Warren to take an item belonging to the venue as memorabilia. The death of Plant&#x27;s young son Karac three days later and the resulting cancellation of the remaining tour dates rendered Graham&#x27;s action academic.

Parliament-Funkadelic brought the P-Funk Earth Tour to the Coliseum on January 21, 1977. Their performance was recorded and released as a double LP set entitled .

Lynyrd Skynyrd played their July 7, 1977 on their Gimme Back My Bullets Tour.

The stadium played host to Amnesty International&#x27;s Human Rights Now! Benefit Concert on September 23, 1988. The show was headlined by Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band and Peter Gabriel and also featured Tracy Chapman, Youssou N&#x27;Dour, Roy Orbison and Joan Baez.

Metallica and Guns N&#x27; Roses brought the Guns N&#x27; Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour to the Coliseum on September 24, 1992, with Body Count as their opening act.

U2 played 2 nights in June 1997 at the Oakland Coliseum as part of their &quot;PopMart&quot; tour. They were supported by Oasis, one of the first shows of their &quot;Be Here Now&quot; tour.

The stadium played host to The Gigantour on September 8, 2006, featuring performances by Megadeth, Lamb of God, Opeth, Arch Enemy, Overkill, Into Eternity, Sanctity and The SmashUp.

U2 performed at the stadium again during their 360° Tour on June 7, 2011, with Lenny Kravitz and Moonalice as their opening acts in front of 64,829 people. The show was originally scheduled to take place on June 16, 2010, but was postponed, due to Bono&#x27;s emergency back surgery.

On August 5, 2017, Green Day played a homecoming concert at the Coliseum. The show was part of the band&#x27;s summer tour in support of their third number1 album, Revolution Radio.

The stadium hosted the &quot;Bay Area&quot; edition of large hip-hop music festival Rolling Loud in 2018 and &#x27;19. 2019 headliners included Future, G-Eazy, Migos, and Lil Uzi Vert.

On October 1, 2021, and October 2, 2021, regional Mexican giant Los Bukis closed out their reunion tour at the Coliseum, following a 25-year hiatus. The concerts were not included in the tour at first but were eventually added due to increased demand.

===In popular culture===
The music video for the Huey Lewis &amp; the News song &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; was shot at a concert at the Coliseum on December 31, 1986.

Richard Marx shot the video for &quot;Take This Heart&quot; on the baseball field of the Coliseum.

The stadium was the location for the 1994 Disney movie &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot;. Although Angel Stadium of Anaheim (known as Anaheim Stadium at the time) was where the Angels actually played, it was damaged in the 1994 Southern California earthquake. Anaheim Stadium was used for views from the outside and aerial views, while the Coliseum was used for interior shots.

The Coliseum was also used for scenes in the 2011 film &quot;Moneyball&quot;.

The climax of the novel &quot;There There&quot; by Tommy Orange takes place in the Coliseum.

===Other events===
The stadium has hosted an AMA Supercross Championship round since 2011.

The stadium has also hosted a Monster Jam event since 2008.

==Criticism==

===Baseball===

In 2011, &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; named it the fifth-worst stadium in the majors, partly due to its expansive foul territory. In 2017 &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the Coliseum &quot;a bland, charmless concrete monstrosity&quot; that &quot;isn&#x27;t worthy of preservation... perhaps America&#x27;s most hated sports stadium&quot;.

Two years later, in another &quot;Times&quot; article, writer Jack Nicas not only defended the Coliseum against criticism, he argued that its perceived failings were actually strengths. &quot;The Coliseum is cheap, gritty and fun,&quot; he said. To his surprise, on moving to Oakland four years earlier, he had come to love the Coliseum as much as he had loved Fenway Park while growing up and while attending college in Boston, and Wrigley Field when he moved to Chicago after graduating college. If those parks were the baseball equivalent of classic pubs, Nicas wrote, &quot;the Coliseum is baseball&#x27;s last dive bar.&quot;

As a season ticket holder, Nicas got concessions at half price, leading to a combined cost of $7 for a hot dog and beer, a deal that he doubted could be matched anywhere else in the city. The Coliseum was also more spacious than Fenway or Wrigley, and while its expansive foul territory put fans at a distance it also allowed them more opportunities to see great catches by fielders. But while he found other A&#x27;s fans who appreciated what the Coliseum had to offer and, like him, feared it would be lost in a new ballpark, he admitted those virtues had not drawn enough spectators to the Coliseum for the team to justify remaining there.

===Public debt===
A 1996 expansion of the stadium was funded by a controversial issuance—critics said that &quot;(Oakland) Raiders&#x27; late owner, Al Davis, fleeced local officials at the expense of taxpayers&quot;—of some $220 million of public debt by both Alameda County and the City of Oakland, resulting in substantial debt service payments for both governments. As of spring of 2018, the City of Oakland still owed $135 million for the expansion.

In December 2019, Alameda County officials announced the sale of the county&#x27;s interest in the stadium to the Oakland A&#x27;s baseball club, saying the $85 million deal would allow the county to pay off its share of the debt. In a joint statement, Supervisor Scott Haggerty and Supervisor Nate Miley noted that the two Supervisors &quot;have led the negotiations and played instrumental roles in moving the sale of the county&#x27;s share forward in the hope that, once finalized, the $85 million valuation will relieve the county of debt which has weighed on taxpayers for decades.&quot;

===Mount Davis===
One feature of the 1996 expansion was the addition of more than 10,000 seats in the upper deck that now spans the outfield in the baseball configuration, enclosing the stadium. Due to the stands&#x27; height and the loss of the Oakland hills view, A&#x27;s fans have derisively nicknamed the structure &quot;Mount Davis&quot;, after late Raiders owner Al Davis. It has been criticized as an area which has made the Oakland Coliseum look ever more like a football stadium, and not at all one for baseball. From 1997 to 2005, while the A&#x27;s opened part of the upper deck for baseball, they did not count it as part of listed capacity; while the &quot;official&quot; capacity was 43,962, the &quot;actual&quot; capacity was 55,945.

In 2006, the Athletics covered the entire third deck with a tarp, reducing capacity to 34,077—the smallest capacity in MLB at the time. Even if a game was otherwise sold out, the A&#x27;s would not sell any seats in the area. It would remain covered except if they made the World Series. The A&#x27;s said that closing off the upper deck would create a &quot;more intimate environment&quot; for baseball. This drew criticism from fans, the Oakland City Council, and sports marketing analysts baffled at owner Lew Wolff&#x27;s decision, with some stating that this was cover for a possible move to San Jose (see Cisco Field). There were 20,878 seats covered up by the tarp which would otherwise have been usable for baseball.

In February 2013, the Oakland Raiders announced that they would cover 11,000 seats in the Mount Davis section with a tarp; this reduced capacity to 53,250, making the coliseum by far the smallest in the NFL in seating capacity for its final years in the league (league rules required a minimum capacity of 50,000, and no other stadium, barring the temporary-used Dignity Health Sports Park, seated fewer than 61,000). This was done in order to potentially allow more Raiders games to be televised locally, as games are blacked out if less than 85% tickets are sold. Under NFL rules, the tarps had to stay in place all season long, even during the playoffs.

In 2017, new Athletics team President Dave Kaval decided to open several sections in the original third deck that were covered by tarps, though Mount Davis stayed tarped. This increased capacity by 12,103 to 47,170. The Athletics have since occasionally removed the tarp on Mount Davis for specific games, such as occasional Bay Bridge Series games against the San Francisco Giants, and the 2019 American League Wild Card Game against the Tampa Bay Rays. The latter set a record for attendance of a Wild Card Game, at 54,005.

===Facility issues===
On June 16, 2013, following the game against the Seattle Mariners, the Coliseum experienced a severe sewage backup. This led to pipes leaking out puddles of sewage into the showers, offices, visitor training room and storage areas on the clubhouse level of the stadium, all of which are below sea level. After the game, the A&#x27;s and Mariners were forced to share the Oakland Raiders locker room, located on the stadium&#x27;s second floor. According to Coliseum officials, the stadium&#x27;s aging plumbing system was overtaxed after a six-game homestand that drew close to baseball capacity crowds totaling 171,756 fans.

This was not the first time sewage problems cropped up at the stadium. On one occasion, the Los Angeles Angels complained about &quot;E. coli&quot; in the visiting team&#x27;s training room after a backup. Backups occur even when no events are taking place there. For instance, Lew Wolff wanted to go to dinner on June 12, 2013 (while the A&#x27;s were on the road) at one of the Coliseum&#x27;s restaurants, only to discover that food service had been halted due to a sewage leak in the kitchen.

Since 2014, it has been presumed that a family of possums live inside the stadium. On at least two separate occasions during the 2014 season, a possum scurried onto the field during an A&#x27;s game. The A&#x27;s won both those games, leading fans to embrace the animal as the &quot;Rally Possum&quot;. By 2022, possums were still known to be living inside the stadium, and in 2023, a possum was seen in the away team broadcast booth. For the beginning of the 2023 season, the broadcast crews for visiting teams would be forced to move to a smaller booth due to droppings left by possums in the normal booth.

On September 28, 2024, two days after the final game the Athletics will play in that stadium, the infamous tarp scattering across the top of Mount Davis was removed and shown to daylight for the first time in years. This sparked outrage across the Oakland Athletics fanbase, hence the fact that the team&#x27;s executive staff refused to remove the tarp prior.

=== Potential cause of relocation ===
Entering the 2019 sport seasons, the city of Oakland was blessed to three successful professional sports teams (Raiders, Athletics, Warriors). As of the 2025 sports season, the city of Oakland lost every single one of these franchises (the Warriors left for San Francisco, the Raiders left for Las Vegas, and the Athletics left for Sacramento before permanently moving to Las Vegas). 

This statistic, which has never seen before in any city in America, sparked outrage by fans of these teams and backlash to the city of Oakland for &quot;turning their backs&quot; on the fans by refusing to renovate and upgrade the stadium.
