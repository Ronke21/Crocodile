== History ==
=== Founding and establishment ===

In 1869, Goldman Sachs was founded by Marcus Goldman in New York City in a one-room basement office next to a coal chute. In 1882, Goldman&#x27;s son-in-law Samuel Sachs joined the firm. In 1885, Goldman&#x27;s son, Henry Goldman, and his son-in-law, Ludwig Dreyfuss, joined the business and the firm adopted its present name, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. The company pioneered the use of commercial paper for entrepreneurs and joined the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1896. By 1898, the firm&#x27;s capital stood at $1.6 million. It opened offices in Boston and Chicago in 1900, San Francisco in 1918, and Philadelphia and St. Louis in 1920.

Goldman entered the initial public offering market in 1906 when it took Sears, Roebuck and Company public. The deal was facilitated by Henry Goldman&#x27;s personal friendship with Julius Rosenwald, an owner of Sears. Other underwriting work for initial public offerings followed, including those of General Cigar Company also in 1906, F. W. Woolworth Company in 1912, and Continental Can. The firm was an innovator at establishing the price–earnings ratio, instead of book value, as a method for valuing companies, and was therefore able to raise funds for retailers and companies with few hard assets.

In 1912, Henry S. Bowers became the first non-member of the founding family to become a partner of the company and share in its profits. In 1917, under growing pressure from the other partners in the firm due to his pro-German stance, Henry Goldman resigned. The Sachs family gained full control of the firm until Waddill Catchings joined the company in 1918. By 1928, Catchings was the Goldman partner with the single largest stake in the firm. In 1919, the company acquired a major interest in Merck &amp; Co. and in 1922, it acquired a major interest in General Foods. On December 4, 1928, the firm launched the Goldman Sachs Trading Corp.Ad, a closed-end fund. The fund failed during the Wall Street Crash of 1929, amid accusations that Goldman had engaged in share price manipulation and insider trading.

=== 1930–1980 ===
In 1930, during the Great Depression, the firm ousted Catchings, and Sidney Weinberg assumed the role of senior partner. Weinberg shifted Goldman&#x27;s focus away from trading and toward investment banking. His actions helped to restore some of Goldman&#x27;s tarnished reputation. Under Weinberg&#x27;s leadership, Goldman was the lead advisor on the $657 million initial public offering of Ford Motor Company in 1956, a major victory at the time, as well as the $350 million debenture offering by Sears Roebuck in 1958. Under Weinberg&#x27;s leadership, the firm started an investment research division and a municipal bond department, and it became an early innovator in risk arbitrage.

In the 1950s, Gus Levy joined the firm as a securities trader, where two powers fought for supremacy, one from investment banking and one from securities trading. Levy was a pioneer in block trading and the firm established this trend under his guidance. Due to Weinberg&#x27;s heavy influence, the firm formed an investment banking division in 1956 in an attempt to shift focus off Weinberg. In 1957, the company&#x27;s headquarters were relocated to 20 Broad Street, New York City.

In 1969, Levy took over Weinberg&#x27;s role as Senior Partner and built Goldman&#x27;s trading franchise once again. Levy is credited with Goldman&#x27;s famous philosophy of being &quot;long-term greedy,&quot; which implied that as long as money is made over the long term, short-term losses are bearable. At the same time, partners reinvested nearly all of their earnings in the firm. Weinberg remained a senior partner of the firm and died in July of that year.

Another financial crisis for the firm occurred in 1970, when the Penn Central Transportation Company went bankrupt with over $80 million (~$ in ) in commercial paper outstanding, most of it issued through Goldman Sachs. The bankruptcy was large, and the resulting lawsuits, notably by the SEC, threatened the partnership capital, survival, and reputation of the firm. It was this bankruptcy that resulted in credit ratings for every issuer of commercial paper today by several credit rating services.

Under the direction of Senior Partner Stanley R. Miller, the firm opened its first international office in London in 1970 and created a Private Wealth Management division along with a fixed income division in 1972. It pioneered the &quot;white knight&quot; strategy in 1974 during its attempts to defend Electric Storage Battery against a hostile takeover bid from International Nickel and Goldman&#x27;s rival, Morgan Stanley. John Weinberg, the son of Sidney Weinberg, and John C. Whitehead assumed the roles of co-senior partners in 1976, once again emphasizing the co-leadership at the firm. One of their initiatives was the establishment of 14 business principles.

=== 1981–2000 ===
On November 16, 1981, the firm acquired J. Aron &amp; Company, a commodities trading firm that merged with the Fixed Income division to become known as Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities. J. Aron was involved in the coffee and gold markets, and the former CEO of Goldman, Lloyd Blankfein, joined the firm as a result of this merger.

In 1983, the firm moved into a newly constructed global headquarters at 85 Broad Street and occupied that building until it moved to its current headquarters in 2009. In 1985, it underwrote the public offering of the real estate investment trust that owned Rockefeller Center, then the largest REIT offering in history. In accordance with the beginning of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the firm also became involved in facilitating the global privatization movement by advising companies that were spinning off from their parent governments.

In 1986, the firm formed Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which manages the majority of its mutual funds and hedge funds. In the same year, the firm also underwrote the IPO of Microsoft, advised General Electric on its acquisition of RCA, and joined the London and Tokyo stock exchanges, where its mergers and acquisitions grew. During the 1980s, the firm became the first bank to distribute its investment research electronically and created the first public offering of original issue deep-discount bond. In 1988, it helped the State Bank of India obtain a credit rating and issue US$200 million in the US commercial paper market.

Robert Rubin and Stephen Friedman assumed the co-senior partnership in 1990 and pledged to focus on globalization of the firm to strengthen the merger &amp; acquisition and trading business lines. In 1990, the firm introduced paperless trading to the New York Stock Exchange. Rubin left the firm in 1992 to work in the Presidency of Bill Clinton. In 1994, the company launched the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) and opened its first office in China in Beijing. That same year, Jon Corzine became CEO, following the retirement of Friedman as general partner.

Rubin had drawn criticism in Congress for using a Treasury Department account under his personal control to distribute $20 billion to bail out Mexican bonds, of which Goldman was a key distributor. On November 22, 1994, the Mexican Bolsa stock market admitted Goldman Sachs and one other firm to operate on that market. In 1994, the Mexican peso crisis threatened to wipe out the value of Mexico&#x27;s bonds held by Goldman Sachs.

In 1994, Goldman financed Rockefeller Center in a deal that allowed it to take an ownership interest in 1996, and sold Rockefeller Center to Tishman Speyer in 2000. In April 1996, Goldman was the lead underwriter of the initial public offering of Yahoo!. In 1998, it was the co-lead manager of the ¥2 trillion (yen) NTT DoCoMo IPO. In 1999, Goldman acquired Hull Trading Company for $531 million (~$ in ), as part of its shift towards electronic trading. After decades of debate among the partners, the company became a public company via an initial public offering in May 1999. Goldman sold 12.6% of the company to the public, and after the IPO, 48.3% of the company was held by 221 former partners, 21.2% of the company was held by non-partner employees, and the remaining 17.9% was held by retired Goldman partners and two long-time investors, Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and Assn, the investing arm of Kamehameha Schools. The shares were priced at $53 each at listing. After the IPO, Henry Paulson became chairman and chief executive officer, succeeding Jon Corzine.

=== 2000–2007 ===
In September 2000, Goldman Sachs purchased Spear, Leeds, &amp; Kellogg, one of the largest specialist firms on the New York Stock Exchange, for $6.3 billion (~$ in ).

In January 2000, Goldman, along with Lehman Brothers, was the lead manager for the first internet bond offering for the World Bank.

In 2000, Goldman Sachs advised Jim and Janet Baker on the sale of Dragon NaturallySpeaking to Lernout &amp; Hauspie of Belgium for $580 million in L&amp;H stock. L&amp;H later collapsed due to accounting fraud and its stock price declined significantly. The Bakers filed a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs, alleging negligence, intentional and negligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty since Goldman did not uncover and warn Dragon or the Bakers of the accounting problems of the acquirer, L&amp;H. Lawyers for Goldman said it was not Goldman&#x27;s job to uncover the accounting fraud. On January 23, 2013, a federal jury rejected the Bakers&#x27; claims and found Goldman Sachs not liable to the Bakers, instead siding with Goldman in counterclaims.

In March 2003, the firm took a 45% stake in a joint venture with JBWere, the Australian investment bank. In April 2003, Goldman acquired The Ayco Company L.P., a fee-based financial counseling service. In October 2003, in its Global Economics Paper No. 99 (Dreaming With BRICs: The Path to 2050), researchers at Goldman Sachs led by Jim O&#x27;Neill, Baron O&#x27;Neill of Gatley introduced the BRIC concept, identifying the developing countries of Brazil, Russia, India, and China, as rising economic powers. In May 2006, Paulson left the firm to serve as United States Secretary of the Treasury, and Lloyd Blankfein was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer. In January 2007, Goldman, along with CanWest Global Communications, acquired Alliance Atlantis, the company with the broadcast rights to the CSI franchise.

=== Subprime mortgage crisis: 2007–2008 ===
As a result of its involvement in securitization during the subprime mortgage crisis, Goldman Sachs suffered during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, and it received a $10 billion investment from the United States Department of the Treasury as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a financial bailout created by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The investment was made in November 2008 and was repaid with interest in June 2009.

During the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, Goldman profited from the collapse in subprime mortgage bonds in summer 2007 by short-selling subprime mortgage-backed securities. Two Goldman traders, Michael Swenson and Josh Birnbaum, are credited with being responsible for the firm&#x27;s large profits during the crisis. The pair, members of Goldman&#x27;s structured products group in New York City, made a profit of $4 billion by &quot;betting&quot; on a collapse in the subprime market and shorting mortgage-related securities. By summer 2007, they persuaded colleagues to see their point of view and convinced skeptical risk management executives. The firm initially avoided large subprime write-downs and achieved a net profit due to significant losses on non-prime securitized loans being offset by gains on short mortgage positions. The firm&#x27;s viability was called into question as the crisis intensified in September 2008.

In October 2007, Goldman Sachs was criticized for packaging risky mortgages and selling them to the public as safe investments.

In 2007, former Goldman Sachs trader Matthew Marshall Taylor was fired after hiding an $8.3 billion unauthorized trade involving derivatives on the S&amp;P 500 index by making &quot;multiple false entries&quot; into a Goldman trading system, with the objective of protecting his year-end bonus of $1.5 million. The trades cost the company $118 million. In 2013, Taylor plead guilty to charges and was sentenced to 9 months in prison and was ordered to repay the $118 million loss.

On September 21, 2008, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the last two major investment banks in the United States, both confirmed that they would become traditional bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve&#x27;s approval of their bid to become banks ended the business model of an independent securities firm, 75 years after Congress separated them from deposit-taking lenders, and capped weeks of chaos that sent Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy and led to the rushed sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America On September 23, 2008, Berkshire Hathaway agreed to purchase $5 billion in Goldman&#x27;s preferred stock, and also received warrants to buy another $5 billion in Goldman&#x27;s common stock within five years. The company also raised $5 billion via a public offering of shares at $123 per share. Goldman also received a $10 billion preferred stock investment from the U.S. Treasury in October 2008, as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).

Andrew Cuomo, then New York Attorney General, questioned Goldman&#x27;s decision to pay 953 employees bonuses of at least $1 million (~$ in ) each after it received TARP funds in 2008. In that same period, however, CEO Lloyd Blankfein and six other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses, stating they believed it was the right thing to do, in light of &quot;the fact that we are part of an industry that&#x27;s directly associated with the ongoing economic distress&quot;. Cuomo called the move &quot;appropriate and prudent&quot;, and urged the executives of other banks to follow the firm&#x27;s lead and refuse bonus payments. In June 2009, Goldman Sachs repaid the U.S. Treasury&#x27;s TARP investment, with 23% interest (in the form of $318 million in preferred dividend payments and $1.418 billion in warrant redemptions). On March 18, 2011, Goldman Sachs received Federal Reserve approval to buy back Berkshire&#x27;s preferred stock in Goldman. In December 2009, Goldman announced that its top 30 executives would be paid year-end bonuses in restricted stock that they cannot sell for five years, with clawback provisions.

During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve introduced several short-term credit and liquidity facilities to help stabilize markets. Some of the transactions under these facilities provided liquidity to institutions whose disorderly failure could have severely stressed an already fragile financial system. Goldman Sachs was one of the heaviest users of these loan facilities, taking out many loans between March 18, 2008, and April 22, 2009. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), the first Fed facility ever to provide overnight loans to investment banks, loaned Goldman Sachs a total of $589 billion against collateral such as corporate market instruments and mortgage-backed securities. The Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), which allows primary dealers to borrow liquid Treasury securities for one month in exchange for less liquid collateral, loaned Goldman Sachs a total of $193 billion. Goldman Sachs&#x27;s borrowings totaled $782 billion in hundreds of revolving transactions over these months. The loans were fully repaid in accordance with the terms of the facilities.

In 2008, Goldman Sachs started a &quot;Returnship&quot; internship program after research and consulting with other firms led them to understand that career breaks happen and that returning to the workforce was difficult, especially for women. The goal of the Returnship program was to offer a chance at temporary employment for workers. Goldman Sachs holds the trademark for the term &#x27;Returnship&#x27;. According to a 2009 BrandAsset Valuator survey taken of 17,000 people nationwide, the firm&#x27;s reputation suffered in 2008 and 2009, and rival Morgan Stanley was respected more than Goldman Sachs, a reversal of the sentiment in 2006. In 2011, Goldman took full control of JBWere in a $1 billion (~$ in ) buyout.

=== Global Alpha ===
In September 2011, Goldman Sachs announced that it was shutting down Global Alpha Fund LP, its largest hedge fund, which had been housed under Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM). Global Alpha, which was created in the mid-1990s with $10 million, was once &quot;one of the biggest and best performing hedge funds in the world&quot; with more than $12 billion assets under management (AUM) at its peak in 2007. Global Alpha used quantitative analysis and computer-driven models to invest, using high-frequency trading. It was founded by Cliff Asness and Mark Carhart, who developed the statistical models on which the trading was based. Global Alpha was described by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as a &quot;big, secretive hedge fund&quot;—the &quot;Cadillac of a fleet of alternative investments&quot; that had made millions for Goldman Sachs by 2006. By mid-2008, assets under management (AUM) of the fund had declined to $2.5 billion, by June 2011, AUM was less than $1.7 billion, and by September 2011, after suffering losses that year, AUM was approximately $1 billion.

=== 2013–2015 ===
In 2013, Goldman underwrote the $2.913 billion (~$ in ) Grand Parkway System Toll Revenue Bond offering for the Houston, Texas area, one of the fastest-growing areas in the United States. The bond will be repaid from toll revenue.

In April 2013, together with Deutsche Bank, Goldman led a $17 billion bond offering by Apple Inc., the largest corporate-bond deal in history and Apple&#x27;s first since 1996. Goldman Sachs managed both of Apple&#x27;s previous bond offerings in the 1990s.

In June 2013, Goldman Sachs purchased the loan portfolio from Brisbane-based Suncorp Group, one of Australia&#x27;s largest banks and insurance companies. The A$1.6 billion face amount loan portfolio was purchased for A$960 million.

In September 2013, Goldman Sachs Asset Management agreed to acquire the stable value business of Deutsche Asset &amp; Wealth Management, with total assets under supervision of $21.6 billion (~$ in ) .

In 2014, Goldman Sachs acquired an 18% stake in DONG Energy (now Ørsted A/S), the largest electric utility in Denmark, from the Danish government after the company needed fresh capital but was unable to attract state funding. The sale led to protests by the public in Copenhagen and led to the resignation of six cabinet ministers and the withdrawal of the Socialist People&#x27;s Party from Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt&#x27;s leftist governing coalition. Protesters were wary of Goldman having an ownership stake due to its role in the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the possible shift of the company&#x27;s earnings to tax havens. Additional protests occurred in 2016 when the initial public offering of the company resulted in a windfall profit for Goldman. Goldman purchased the 18% stake in 2014 for 8 billion kroner and sold just over a 6% stake in 2017 for 6.5 billion kroner. Goldman sold its remaining stake in the utility in 2017.

In January 2014, the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) filed a lawsuit against Goldman for $1 billion after the firm lost 98% of the $1.3 billion the LIA invested with Goldman in 2007. The losses stemmed from derivatives trades that earned Goldman $350 million in fees. In court documents, Goldman admitted to having used small gifts, occasional travel and an internship to gain access to Libya&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund. In October 2016, after a trial, Justice Vivien Rose entered a judgment in Goldman Sachs&#x27;s favor, saying that the relationship &quot;did not go beyond the normal cordial and mutually beneficial relationship that grows up between a bank and a client&quot; and that Goldman&#x27;s fees were not excessive.

In August 2015, Goldman Sachs agreed to acquire General Electric&#x27;s GE Capital Bank on-line deposit platform, including US$8-billion of on-line deposits and another US$8-billion of brokered certificates of deposit.

=== 2016–2020 ===

In April 2016, Goldman Sachs launched GS Bank, a direct bank. In October 2016, Goldman Sachs Bank USA started offering no-fee unsecured personal loans under the brand Marcus by Goldman Sachs. In March 2016, Goldman Sachs agreed to acquire financial technology startup Honest Dollar, a digital retirement savings tool founded by American entrepreneur Whurley, focused on helping small-business employees and self-employed workers obtain affordable retirement plans. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

In May 2017, Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion (~$ in ) of PDVSA 2022 bonds from the Central Bank of Venezuela during the 2017 Venezuelan protests.

In April 2018, Goldman Sachs acquired Clarity Money, a personal finance startup. On September 10, 2018, Goldman Sachs acquired Boyd Corporation from Genstar Capital for $3 billion (~$ in ). On May 16, 2019, Goldman Sachs acquired United Capital Financial Advisers, LLC for $750 million (~$ in ).

In March 2019, Apple, Inc. announced that it would partner with Goldman Sachs to launch the Apple Card, the bank&#x27;s first credit card offering. The partnership opportunity had been turned down by other banks including Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Synchrony Financial.

In March 2019, Goldman Sachs was fined £34.4 million by the London regulator for misreporting millions of transactions over a decade.

In December 2019, the company pledged to invest and finance $750 billion in climate transition projects and to stop financing oil exploration in the Arctic and some projects related to coal.

=== 2020–present ===
In June 2020, Goldman Sachs introduced a new corporate typeface, Goldman Sans, and made it freely available. After Internet users discovered that the terms of the license prohibited the disparagement of Goldman Sachs, the bank was much mocked and disparaged in its font, until it eventually changed the license to the standard SIL Open Font License.

Goldman Sachs was embroiled in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, related to Malaysia&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). The bank paid a fine of $2.9 billion under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the largest such fine to date. In July 2020, Goldman Sachs agreed on a $3.9 billion settlement in Malaysia for criminal charges related to the 1MDB scandal. For charges brought for the same case in other countries, Goldman Sachs agreed in October of the same year to pay more than $2.9 billion, with over $2 billion going to fines imposed in the US.

Effective July 1, 2020, the firm no longer manages initial public offerings of a company without &quot;at least one diverse board candidate, with a focus on women&quot; in the U.S. and Europe.

In August 2021, Goldman Sachs announced that it had agreed to acquire NN Investment Partners, which had US$ 335 billion in assets under management, for €1.7 billion from NN Group.

In September 2021, Goldman Sachs announced to acquire GreenSky for about $2.24 billion (~$ in ) and completed the acquisition in March 2022.

In March 2022, Goldman Sachs announced it was winding down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements regarding sanctions after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Also during that same month, Goldman Sachs announced it had acquired NextCapital Group, a Chicago-based open-architecture digital retirement advice provider.

In June 2022, Goldman Sachs offered its first derivatives product linked to Ether (ETH). Goldman Sachs was announced as an official partner of McLaren.

In September 2022, Goldman Sachs announced the layoff of hundreds of employees across the company, apparently as a result of the earnings report from July of the same year that showed a significant reduction.

In February 2024, &quot;CNBC&quot; reported Goldman Sachs was expanding its reach into the economic lives of more Americans by way of Rhythm Energy, a provider of independent energy in Texas. The firm&#x27;s private equity fund owned the firm, but it operated independently. At the time of the reporting, it was linked to energy networks that provided electricity for 190 million Americans.

The company is growing its Indian business – Goldman Sachs has invested ₹72 crore (₹720 000 000) for 15 lakh (1 500 000) shares in Medi Assist Healthcare debuting in January 2024.

According to a statement made by Goldman CEO David Solomon in January 2025, the credit-card partnership with Apple may end before its contract runs out in 2030.

In February 2025, Goldman Sachs announced the termination of its commitment to diversity on the boards of companies it assists with going public. This decision marks another instance in a series of rollbacks concerning corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which have faced significant criticism from conservative groups. The bank had previously committed to ensuring that each company it takes through the IPO process in the United States or Western Europe would have at least two board members who were not white men. Additionally, the pledge specified that at least one of these individuals should be a woman. Goldman Sachs confirmed the decision to end this initiative on February 11, 2025, reflecting broader shifts in corporate DEI strategies amidst political and societal debates.

==Controversies and legal issues==
The company has been criticized for lack of ethical standards, working with dictatorial regimes, close relationships with the U.S. federal government via a &quot;revolving door&quot; of former employees, and driving up prices of commodities through futures speculation. It has also been criticized by its employees for 100-hour work weeks, high levels of employee dissatisfaction among first-year analysts, abusive treatment by superiors, a lack of mental health resources, and extremely high levels of stress in the workplace leading to physical discomfort.

=== Role in the 2007–2008 financial crisis===
Goldman was criticized for allegedly misleading its investors and profiting from the collapse of the mortgage market during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. This led to investigations from the United States Congress, the United States Department of Justice, and a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that resulted in Goldman paying a $550 million settlement in July 2010. Goldman Sachs denied wrongdoing and stated that its customers were aware of its bets against the mortgage-related security products it was selling to them, and that it only used those bets to hedge against losses.

Goldman Sachs was &quot;excoriated by the press and the public&quot; according to journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera. This was despite the non-retail nature of its business that would normally have kept it out of the public eye. In a story in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published in July 2009, Matt Taibbi characterized Goldman Sachs as a &quot;great vampire squid&quot; sucking money instead of blood, allegedly engineering &quot;every major market manipulation since the Great Depression ... from tech stocks to high gas prices&quot;.

While all the investment banks were scolded by congressional investigations, Goldman Sachs was subject to &quot;a solo hearing in front of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations&quot; and a critical report. In 2011, a Senate panel released a report accusing Goldman Sachs of misleading clients and engaging in conflicts of interest.

====Bonuses paid to employees in 2009 despite financial crisis====
In June 2009, after the firm repaid the TARP investment from the U.S. Treasury, Goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance, setting aside a record $11.4 billion for bonus payments. Andrew Cuomo, then New York Attorney General, questioned Goldman&#x27;s decision to pay 953 employees bonuses of at least $1 million each after it received TARP funds in 2008. That same period, however, CEO Lloyd Blankfein and 6 other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses, stating they believed it was the right thing to do because they were part of the industry that caused economic distress.

===Benefits from the government bailout of AIG===
American International Group received $180 billion in government loans during the financial crisis, much of which was used to pay counterparties under credit default swaps purchased from AIG. Goldman Sachs received $12.9 billion. However, due to the size and nature of the payouts, there was considerable controversy in the media and among some politicians as to whether banks, including Goldman Sachs, should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full via government loans to AIG. If the government let AIG default, according to money manager Michael Lewitt, &quot;its collapse would be as close to an extinction-level event as the financial markets have seen since the Great Depression&quot;.

====Firm&#x27;s response to criticism of AIG payments====
Goldman Sachs maintained that its net exposure to AIG was &quot;not material&quot;, and that the firm was protected by hedges (in the form of CDSs with other counterparties) and $7.5 billion of collateral, which would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an AIG bankruptcy or failure. The firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over $100 million. CFO David Viniar stated that profits related to AIG in the first quarter of 2009 &quot;rounded to zero&quot;, and profits in December were not significant and that he was &quot;mystified&quot; by the interest the government and investors have shown in the bank&#x27;s trading relationship with AIG. Speculation remains that Goldman&#x27;s hedges against its AIG exposure would not have paid out if AIG was allowed to fail. According to a report by the United States Office of the Inspector General of TARP, if AIG had collapsed, it would have made it difficult for Goldman to liquidate its trading positions with AIG, even at discounts, and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that &quot;might have made it difficult for Goldman Sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an AIG default.&quot; Finally, the report said, an AIG default would have forced Goldman Sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations. Goldman argued that CDSs are marked to market (i.e. valued at their current market price) and their positions netted between counterparties daily. Thus, as the cost of insuring AIG&#x27;s obligations against default rose substantially in the lead-up to its bailout, the sellers of the CDS contracts had to post more collateral to Goldman Sachs. The firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an AIG bankruptcy and the risk of knock-on defaults, had AIG been allowed to fail. However, in practice, the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an AIG bankruptcy.

====Possible benefits from attendance at September 15, 2008, meetings at the New York Federal Reserve====
Although many have said there is no evidence to support the claim, some have argued that Goldman Sachs received preferential treatment from the government by participating in the crucial September meetings at the New York Fed, which decided AIG&#x27;s fate. Much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted article published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The article was later corrected to state that Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, was &quot;&quot;one of&quot; the Wall Street chief executives at the meeting&quot;. Representatives from other firms were indeed present at the September AIG meetings. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs CFO David Viniar stated that CEO Blankfein had never &quot;met&quot; with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to discuss AIG; however, they had frequent phone calls. Paulson was not present at the September meetings at the New York Fed. Morgan Stanley was hired by the Federal Reserve to advise on the AIG bailout. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Paulson spoke with the CEO of Goldman Sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout, though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so. While it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence, particularly in a crisis, Paulson spoke with Goldman&#x27;s Blankfein more frequently than with other large banks. Federal officials say that although Paulson was involved in decisions to rescue A.I.G, it was the Federal Reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the A.I.G. bailout.

===Stock price manipulation===
Goldman Sachs was charged for repeatedly issuing research reports with extremely inflated financial projections for Exodus Communications and Goldman Sachs was accused of giving Exodus its highest stock rating even though Goldman knew Exodus did not deserve such a rating. On July 15, 2003, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley were sued for artificially inflating the stock price of RSL Communications by issuing untrue or materially misleading statements in research analyst reports, and paid $3,380,000 (~$ in ) for settlement.

Goldman Sachs was accused of asking for kickback bribes from institutional clients who made large profits flipping stocks which Goldman had intentionally undervalued in initial public offerings it was underwriting during the dot-com bubble. Documents under seal in a decade-long lawsuit concerning eToys.com&#x27;s initial public offering (IPO) in 1999 but released accidentally to &quot;The New York Times&quot; show that IPOs managed by Goldman were purposely underpriced to generate profits for clients of Goldman and that these clients were asked by Goldman to return some of the profits via increased business. The clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was necessary to participate in further such undervalued IPOs. Companies selling undervalued stock and their initial consumer stockholders were both defrauded by this practice.

===Use of offshore tax havens===
A 2016 report by Public Interest Research Group stated that &quot;Goldman Sachs reports having 987 subsidiaries in offshore tax havens, 537 of which are in the Cayman Islands, despite not operating a single legitimate office in that country, according to its own website. The group officially holds $28.6 billion offshore.&quot; The report also noted several other major U.S. banks and companies use the same tax-avoidance tactics.

In 2008, Goldman Sachs had an effective tax rate of only 3.8%, down from 34% the year before, and its tax liability decreased to $14 million in 2008, compared to $6 billion in 2007. Critics have argued that the reduction in Goldman Sachs&#x27;s tax rate was achieved by shifting its earnings to subsidiaries in low or no-tax nations, such as the Cayman Islands.

===Involvement in the European sovereign debt crisis===

Goldman was criticized for its involvement in the 2010 European debt crisis. In 2001, to avoid non-compliance with the Maastricht Treaty, Goldman arranged a secret loan of €2.8 billion for Greece disguised as an off-the-books &quot;cross-currency swap&quot;, hiding 2% of Greece&#x27;s national debt. Goldman received a fee of €600 million for the complicated transaction. In September 2009, Goldman Sachs, among others, created a special credit default swap (CDS) index to cover the high risk of Greece&#x27;s national debt. The interest-rates of Greek national bonds soared, leading the Greek economy very close to bankruptcy in 2010 and 2011.

Many European leaders with roles in the crisis had ties to Goldman Sachs. Lucas Papademos, Greece&#x27;s former prime minister, ran the Central Bank of Greece at the time of the controversial derivatives deals with Goldman Sachs that enabled Greece to hide the size of its debt. Petros Christodoulou, general manager of the Greek Public Debt Management Agency was a former employee of Goldman Sachs. Mario Monti, Italy&#x27;s former prime minister and finance minister, who headed the new government that took over after Berlusconi&#x27;s resignation, was an international adviser to Goldman Sachs. Otmar Issing, former board member of the Bundesbank and the executive board of the European Bank also advised Goldman Sachs. Mario Draghi, then head of the European Central Bank, was the former managing director of Goldman Sachs International. António Borges, Head of the European Department of the International Monetary Fund in 2010–2011 and responsible for most of enterprise privatizations in Portugal since 2011, was the former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. Carlos Moedas, a former Goldman Sachs employee, was the Secretary of State to the Prime Minister of Portugal and Director of ESAME, the agency created to monitor and control the implementation of the structural reforms agreed by the government of Portugal and the troika composed of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Peter Sutherland, former Attorney General of Ireland was a non-executive director of Goldman Sachs International.

===Employees&#x27; views===
Although the allegations against Goldman were later discovered to be lacking evidence, in March 2012, Greg Smith, then-head of Goldman Sachs U.S. equity derivatives sales business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), resigned his position via an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticizing the company and its executives and wrote a book titled &quot;Why I left Goldman Sachs&quot;. Almost all the claims made by Smith turned out to be lacking in evidence and Smith was alleged to be a con artist by &quot;The Observer&quot;. However, &quot;The New York Times&quot; never issued a retraction or admitted to any error in judgment in initially publishing Smith&#x27;s op-ed.
In 2014, a book by former Goldman portfolio manager Steven George Mandis was published entitled &quot;What Happened to Goldman Sachs: An Insider&#x27;s Story of Organizational Drift and Its Unintended Consequences&quot;. Mandis also wrote and defended a PhD dissertation about Goldman at Columbia University. Mandis left in 2004 after working for the firm for 12 years. According to Mandis, there was an &quot;organizational drift&quot; in the company&#x27;s evolution and Goldman came under a variety of pressures that resulted in slow, incremental changes to its culture and business practices. Those changes included becoming a public company, which limited the personal risk of Goldman executives and shifted it to shareholders and put pressure on the company to grow, leading to conflicts of interest.

====Work culture====
In 2021, a group of first year bankers told managers that they are working 100 hours a week with 5 hours sleep at night and that they have been constantly experiencing workplace abuse that has seriously affected their mental health. In May 2022, Goldman Sachs implemented a more flexible vacation policy to help their employees &quot;rest and recharge&quot; whereby senior bankers get unlimited vacation days, and all employees are expected to take a minimum of 15 days vacation every year.

=== Gender bias lawsuit ===
In 2010, two former female employees filed a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs for gender discrimination. Cristina Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich claimed that the firm fostered an &quot;uncorrected culture of sexual harassment and assault&quot; causing women to either be &quot;sexualized or ignored&quot;. The suit cited both cultural and pay discrimination including frequent client trips to strip clubs, client golf outings that excluded female employees, and the fact that female vice presidents made 21% less than their male counterparts. In March 2018, the judge ruled that the female employees may pursue their claims as a group in a class-action lawsuit against Goldman on gender bias, but the class action excludes their claim on sexual harassment.

In May 2023, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $215 million (£170.5 million) to resolve claims made by nearly 2800 female staff. This settlement was made over accusations of the company&#x27;s discriminatory practices, allegedly providing women with lower salaries and lesser opportunities. Government records have revealed that female employees at Goldman Sachs earned 20% less than their male counterparts, which is significantly higher than the 9.4% national gender pay gap. The settlement was reached a month before the scheduled trial of the class-action lawsuit.

On March 13, 2024, WSJ reported that roughly two-thirds of the women who were partners at the end of 2018 have left the firm or no longer have the title. No woman runs a major division or is seen as a credible candidate to succeed Solomon. Only two of the eight executive officers at Goldman are women – in legal and accounting, non-revenue generating positions.

===Advice to short California bonds underwritten by the firm===
On November 11, 2008, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Goldman Sachs had both earned $25 million from underwriting California bonds, and advised other clients to short those bonds. While some journalists criticized the contradictory actions, others pointed out that the opposite investment decisions undertaken by the underwriting side and the trading side of the bank were normal and in line with regulations regarding Chinese walls, and in fact critics had demanded increased independence between underwriting and trading.

===Personnel &quot;revolving-door&quot; with U.S. government===
Several people on the list of former employees of Goldman Sachs have later worked in government positions. Notable examples include British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, former U.S. Secretaries of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, Robert Rubin, and Henry Paulson; U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler; former Under Secretary of State John C. Whitehead; former chief economic advisor Gary Cohn; Governor of New Jersey Phil Murphy and former Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine; former Prime Minister of Italy Mario Monti; former European Central Bank President and former Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi; former Bank of Canada and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney; and the former Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull. In addition, former Goldman employees have headed the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange Group, the World Bank, and competing banks such as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.

During 2008 Goldman Sachs received criticism for an apparent revolving door relationship, in which its employees and consultants moved in and out of high-level U.S. Government positions, creating the potential for conflicts of interest and leading to the moniker &quot;Government Sachs&quot;. Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and former United States Senator and former Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine are former CEOs of Goldman Sachs along with current governor Murphy. Additional controversy attended the selection of former Goldman Sachs lobbyist Mark A. Patterson as chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, despite President Barack Obama&#x27;s campaign promise that he would limit the influence of lobbyists in his administration. In February 2011, the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot; reported that Goldman Sachs was &quot;the company from which Obama raised the most money in 2008&quot;, and that its &quot;CEO Lloyd Blankfein has visited the White House 10 times&quot;.

===Insider trading cases===
In 1986, Goldman Sachs investment banker David Brown pleaded guilty to charges of passing inside information on a takeover deal that eventually was provided to Ivan Boesky. In 1989, Robert M. Freeman, who was a senior Partner, who was the Head of Risk Arbitrage, and who was a protégé of Robert Rubin, pleaded guilty to insider trading, for his own account and for the firm&#x27;s account.

====Rajat Gupta insider trading case====
In April 2010, Goldman director Rajat Gupta was named in an insider-trading case after allegedly informing Raj Rajaratnam of Galleon Group about the $5 billion Berkshire Hathaway investment in Goldman during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Gupta had told Goldman the month before his involvement became public that he wouldn&#x27;t seek re-election as a director. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced civil charges against Gupta covering the Berkshire investment as well as for providing confidential quarterly earnings information from Goldman and Procter &amp; Gamble, on which Gupta served as a member of the board of directors. Gupta was an investor in some of the Galleon hedge funds and he had other business interests with Rajaratnam. Rajaratnam used the information from Gupta to illegally profit in hedge fund trades; the information on Goldman made Rajaratnam&#x27;s funds $17 million richer and the Procter &amp; Gamble data created illegal profits of more than $570,000 for Galleon funds managed by others. Gupta denied the accusations. He was also a board member of AMR Corporation.

Gupta was convicted in June 2012 on insider trading charges stemming from the cases on four criminal felony counts of conspiracy and securities fraud. He was sentenced in October 2012 to two years in prison, an additional year on supervised release and ordered to pay $5 million (~$ in ) in fines. In January 2016, he was released from prison to serve his remaining sentence at home. Gupta challenged the conviction through the courts; it was upheld in 2019.

===Abacus synthetic CDOs and SEC lawsuit===

Unlike many investors and investment bankers, Goldman Sachs anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis. Some of its traders became &quot;bearish&quot; on the housing boom beginning in 2004 and developed mortgage-related securities, originally intended to protect Goldman from investment losses in the housing market. In late 2006, Goldman management changed the firm&#x27;s overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative. As the market began its downturn, Goldman &quot;created even more of these securities&quot;, no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but, according to business journalist Gretchen Morgenson, &quot;enabling it to pocket huge profits&quot; from the mortgage defaults and that Goldman &quot;used the C.D.O.&#x27;s to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes&quot;. Authors Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera stated that &quot;the firm&#x27;s later insistence that it was merely a &#x27;market maker&#x27; in these transactions – implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients – became less true over time&quot;-

The investments were called synthetic CDOs because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations, the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans, but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults – the insurance known as &quot;credit default swaps&quot;. Goldman and some other hedge funds held a &quot;short&quot; position in the securities, paying the premiums, while the investors (insurance companies, pension funds, etc.) receiving the premiums were the &quot;long&quot; position. The longs were responsible for paying the insurance &quot;claim&quot; to Goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted. Through April 2007, Goldman issued over 20 CDOs in its &quot;Abacus&quot; series worth a total of $10.9 billion (~$ in ). All together Goldman packaged, sold, and shorted a total of 47 synthetic CDOs, with an aggregate face value of $66 billion between July 1, 2004, and May 31, 2007.

But while Goldman was praised for its foresight, some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure. These securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by April 2010, at least US$5 billion (~$ in ) worth of the securities either carried &quot;junk&quot; ratings or had defaulted. One CDO examined by critics which Goldman bet against but also sold to investors, was the $800 million (~$ in ) Hudson Mezzanine CDO issued in 2006. In the Senate Permanent Subcommittee hearings, Goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books. Unable to sell them directly, it included them in the underlying securities of the CDO and took the short side, but critics McLean and Nocera complained the CDO prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as &quot;&#x27;assets sourced from the Street&#x27;, making it sound as though Goldman randomly selected the securities, instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book&quot;. The CDO did not perform well, and by March 2008 – just 18 months after its issue – so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out &quot;about US$310 million to Goldman and others who had bet against it&quot;. Goldman&#x27;s head of European fixed-income sales lamented in an e-mail made public by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the &quot;real bad feeling across European sales about some of the trades we did with clients&quot; who had invested in the CDO. &quot;The damage this has done to our franchise is very significant.&quot;

====2010 SEC civil fraud lawsuit====
In April 2010, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Goldman Sachs and one of its vice-presidents, Fabrice Tourre, with securities fraud. The SEC alleged that Goldman had told buyers of a synthetic CDO, a type of investment, that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent CDO manager, ACA Management. In fact, Paulson &amp; Co. a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a &quot;significant role&quot; in the selection, and the package of securities turned out to become &quot;one of the worst-performing mortgage deals of the housing crisis&quot; because &quot;less than a year after the deal was completed, 100% of the bonds selected for Abacus had been downgraded&quot;.

The particular synthetic CDO that the SEC&#x27;s 2010 fraud suit charged Goldman with misleading investors with was called Abacus 2007-AC1. Unlike many of the Abacus securities, 2007-AC1 did not have Goldman Sachs as a short seller, in fact, Goldman Sachs lost money on the deal. That position was taken by the customer (John Paulson) who hired Goldman to issue the security (according to the SEC&#x27;s complaint). Paulson and his employees selected 90 BBB-rated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for. Paulson and the manager of the CDO, ACA Management, worked on the portfolio of 90 bonds to be insured (ACA allegedly unaware of Paulson&#x27;s short position), coming to an agreement in late February 2007. Paulson paid Goldman approximately US$15 million for its work in the deal. Paulson ultimately made a US$1 billion profit from the short investments, the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers. These were primarily IKB Deutsche Industriebank (US$150 million loss), and the investors and insurers of another US$900 million – ACA Financial Guaranty Corp, ABN AMRO, and the Royal Bank of Scotland.

The SEC alleged that Goldman &quot;materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents&quot; about the financial security, including the fact that it had &quot;permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market [the hedge fund manager Paulson &amp; Co.] to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio, while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent, objective third party&quot;, ACA Management. The SEC further alleged that &quot;Tourre also misled ACA into believing ... that Paulson&#x27;s interests in the collateral section [sic] process were aligned with ACA&#x27;s, when, in reality, Paulson&#x27;s interests were sharply conflicting&quot;.

In reply, Goldman issued a statement saying the SEC&#x27;s charges were &quot;unfounded in law and fact&quot;, and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money, that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the CDO, that it had lost $90 million, that ACA selected the portfolio without Goldman suggesting Paulson was to be a long investor, that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller, and vice versa, as it was not normal business practice for a market maker, and that ACA was itself the largest purchaser of the Abacus pool, investing US$951 million. Goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector, rather than from a particular security in the CDO. While some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading, others believed Goldman&#x27;s defense was strong and the SEC&#x27;s case was weak.

Some experts on securities law such as Duke University law professor James Cox, believed the suit had merit because Goldman was aware of the relevance of Paulson&#x27;s involvement and took steps to downplay it. Others, including Wayne State University Law School law professor Peter Henning, noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved, even without knowledge of the part played by Paulson.

Critics of Goldman Sachs point out that Paulson went to Goldman Sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank, Bear Stearns who he had asked to build a CDO. Ira Wagner, the head of Bear Stearns&#x27;s CDO Group in 2007, told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal Paulson was proposing encouraged Paulson to pick the worst assets. Describing Bear Stearns&#x27;s reasoning, one author compared the deal to &quot;a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team&quot;. Goldman claimed it lost $90 million, critics maintain it was simply unable (not due to a lack of trying) to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted.

Critics also question whether the deal was ethical, even if it was legal. Goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers. According to McLean and Nocera, there were dozens of securities being insured in the CDO – for example, another ABACUS – had 130 credits from several different mortgage originators, commercial mortgage-backed securities, debt from Sallie Mae, credit cards, etc. Goldman bought mortgages to create securities, which made it &quot;far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge&quot; that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like New Century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgage-holders back – which is why the fine print on at least one ABACUS prospectus warned long investors that the &#x27;Protection Buyer&#x27; (Goldman) &#x27;may have information, including material, non-public information&#x27; which it was not providing to the long investors.

According to an article in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, critics also worried that Abacus might undermine the position of the United States &quot;as a safe harbor for the world&#x27;s investors&quot; and that &quot;The involvement of European interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that region&#x27;s political leaders, most notably British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who has accused Goldman of &quot;moral bankruptcy&quot;. This is, in short, a big global story ... Is what Goldman Sachs did with its Abacus investment vehicle illegal? That will be for the courts to decide, ... But it doesn&#x27;t take a judge and jury to conclude that, legalities aside, this was just wrong.&quot;

On July 15, 2010, Goldman settled out of court, agreeing to pay the SEC and investors US$550 million, including $300 million to the U.S. government and $250 million to investors, one of the largest penalties ever paid by a Wall Street firm. The company did not admit or deny wrongdoing, but did admit that its marketing materials for the investment &quot;contained incomplete information&quot;, and agreed to change some of its business practices regarding mortgage investments.

====Charges against Fabrice Tourre====
The settlement in July 2010 did not cover charges against Goldman vice president and salesman for Abacus, Fabrice Tourre. Tourre unsuccessfully sought a dismissal of the suit, which went to trial in 2013. On August 1, a federal jury found Tourre liable on six of seven counts, including that he misled investors about the mortgage deal. He was found not liable on the most specific charge, that he deliberately made an untrue or misleading statement. Tourre was not subject to criminal charges or jail time. He was fined $650,000 and forced to return a $175,000 bonus. Tourre then pursued a career in academia.

===Alleged commodity price manipulation===
A provision of the 1999 financial deregulation law, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, allows commercial banks to enter into any business activity that is &quot;complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally&quot;. Since the passing of the laws, Goldman Sachs and other investment banks such as Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials, such as food products, zinc, copper, tin, nickel and, aluminum.

Some critics, such as Matt Taibbi, believe that allowing a company to both &quot;control the supply of crucial physical commodities, and also trade in the financial products that might be related to those markets&quot;, is &quot;akin to letting casino owners who take book on NFL games during the week also coach all the teams on Sundays&quot;.

====Goldman Sachs Commodity Index and the 2005–2008 Food Bubble====
Frederick Kaufman, a contributing editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, argued in a 2010 article that Goldman&#x27;s creation of the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (now the S&amp;P GSCI) helped passive investors such as pension funds, mutual funds and others engage in food price speculation by betting on financial products based on the commodity index. These financial products disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand, making prices more volatile and defeating the price stabilization mechanism of the futures exchange.

A June 2010 article in &quot;The Economist&quot; defended commodity investors and oil index-tracking funds, citing a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that found that commodities without futures markets and ignored by index-tracking funds also saw price rises during the period.

====Alleged manipulation of aluminum price and supply====

Although it was described by others as just a conspiracy theory, in a July 2013 article, David Kocieniewski, a journalist with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, accused Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms of &quot;capitalizing on loosened federal regulations&quot; to manipulate &quot;a variety of commodities markets&quot;, particularly aluminum, citing &quot;financial records, regulatory documents, and interviews with people involved in the activities&quot;. After Goldman Sachs purchased aluminum warehousing company Metro International in 2010, the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories – to make beer cans, home siding, and other products – went from an average of 6 weeks to more than 16 months. The premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market doubled, with industry analysts blaming the lengthy delays at Metro International, costing American consumers more than $5 billion from 2010 to 2013. Goldman&#x27;s ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum – a million and a half tons – in a network of 27 Metro International warehouses in Detroit, Michigan, was blamed. To avoid hoarding and price manipulation, the London Metal Exchange requires that &quot;at least 3,000 tons of that metal must be moved out each day&quot;. According to the article, Goldman dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum – not to factories, but &quot;from one warehouse to another&quot;.

In August 2013, Goldman Sachs was subpoenaed by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission as part of an investigation into complaints that Goldman-owned metals warehouses had &quot;intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum&quot;.

According to Lydia DePillis of Wonkblog, when Goldman bought the warehouses it &quot;started paying traders extra to bring their metal&quot; to Goldman&#x27;s warehouses &quot;rather than anywhere else. The longer it stays, the more rent Goldman can charge, which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium.&quot; The effect is &quot;amplified&quot; by another company, Glencore, which is &quot;doing the same thing in its warehouse in Vlissingen&quot;.

Columnist Matt Levine, writing for &quot;Bloomberg News&quot;, described the conspiracy theory as &quot;pretty silly&quot;, but said that it was a rational outcome of an irrational and inefficient system which Goldman Sachs may not have properly understood.

In December 2014, Goldman Sachs sold its aluminum warehousing business to Ruben Brothers.

In March 2015, the legal case against Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Glencore, the two investment banks&#x27; warehousing businesses, and the London Metal Exchange in various combinations – of violating U.S. anti-trust laws, was dismissed by United States District Court for the Southern District of New York Judge Katherine B. Forrest in Manhattan for lack of evidence and other reasons. The lawsuit was revived in 2019 after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said the previous decision was in error. That case was dismissed by judge Paul A. Engelmayer in 2021 although Reynolds Consumer Products and two other plaintiffs that had directly transacted with the defendants were allowed to pursue the case. Those purchasers settled with Goldman and JPMorgan Chase in 2022.

====Oil futures speculation====
Investment banks, including Goldman, have also been accused of driving up the price of gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange. In August 2011, &quot;confidential documents&quot; were leaked &quot;detailing the positions&quot; in the oil futures market of several investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, and Barclays, just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of 2008. The presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets, and so the means to significantly sway prices, and unlike traditional market participants, neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold. Journalist Kate Sheppard of Mother Jones called it &quot;a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude&quot;. However, another source stated that, &quot;Just before crude oil hit its record high in mid-2008, 15 of the world&#x27;s largest banks were betting that prices would fall, according to private trading data...&quot;

In April 2011, a couple of observers – Brad Johnson of the blog Climate Progress, founded by Joseph J. Romm, and Alain Sherter of CBS MoneyWatch – noted that Goldman Sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil. Climate Progress quoted Goldman as warning &quot;that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation&quot; in petroleum futures, and that &quot;net speculative positions are four times as high as in June 2008&quot;, when the price of oil peaked.

It stated that, &quot;Goldman Sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least $20 higher than supply and demand dictate.&quot; Sherter noted that Goldman&#x27;s concern over speculation did not prevent it (along with other speculators) from lobbying against regulations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to establish &quot;position limits&quot;, which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold, and thus prevent speculation.

According to Joseph P. Kennedy II, by 2012, prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by &quot;hedge funds and bankers&quot; pumping &quot;billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges, chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price&quot;. The problem started, according to Kennedy, in 1991, when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, Goldman Sachs made an argument to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that Wall Street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades.

The commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed Goldman Sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades. Other exemptions followed, and &quot;by 2008, eight investment banks accounted for 32% of the total oil futures market&quot;.

===Improper securities lending practices===
In January 2016, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $15 million after it was found that a team of Goldman employees, between 2008 and 2013, &quot;granted locates&quot; by arranging to borrow securities to settle short sales without adequate review. However, U.S. regulation for short selling requires brokerages to enter an agreement to borrow securities on behalf of customers or to have &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; for believing that it can borrow the security before entering contracts to complete the sale. Additionally, Goldman Sachs gave &quot;incomplete and unclear&quot; responses to information requests from SEC compliance examiners in 2013 about the firm&#x27;s securities lending practices.

===Conspiring to allow $1 billion in bribes to obtain business from 1MDB Malaysian sovereign wealth fund (2015–2020)===

In July 2009, Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak set up a sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).

In 2015, U.S. prosecutors began examining the role of Goldman in helping 1MDB raise more than $6 billion (~$ in ). The 1MDB bond deals were said to generate &quot;above-average&quot; commissions and fees for Goldman amounting close to $600 million or more than 9% of the proceeds.

Beginning in 2016, Goldman was investigated for a $3 billion (~$ in ) bond created by the bank for 1MDB. U.S. Prosecutors investigated whether the bank failed to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires financial institutions to report suspicious transactions to regulators. In November 2018, Goldman&#x27;s former chairman of Southeast Asia, Tim Leissner, admitted that more than US$200 million (~$ in ) in proceeds from 1MDB bonds went into the accounts controlled by him and a relative, bypassing the company&#x27;s compliance rules. Leissner and another former Goldman banker, Roger Ng, together with Malaysian financier Jho Low were charged with money laundering. Goldman chief executive David Solomon felt &quot;horrible&quot; about the ex-staff breaking the law by going around the policies and apologized to Malaysians for Leissner&#x27;s role in the 1MDB scandal.

On December 17, 2018, Malaysia filed criminal charges against subsidiaries of Goldman and their former employees Leissner and Ng, alleging their commission of misleading statements to dishonestly misappropriate US$2.7 billion from the proceeds of 1MDB bonds arranged and underwritten by Goldman in 2012 and 2013.

On July 24, 2020, it was announced that the Malaysian government would receive US$2.5 billion in cash from Goldman Sachs, and a guarantee from the bank they would also return US$1.4 billion in assets linked to 1MDB bonds. Put together this was substantially less than the US$7.5 billion that had been previously demanded by the Malaysian finance minister. At the same time, the Malaysian government agreed to drop all criminal charges against the bank and that it would cease legal proceedings against 17 current and former Goldman directors. Some commentators argued that Goldman secured a very favorable deal. Despite the settlement, Malaysian prime minister called it unfair to the country as the settled amount was not sufficient in September 2023, and Goldman had in the following month sued Malaysia in a London arbitration court over the settlement reached by both parties.

In October 2020, the Malaysian subsidiary of Goldman Sachs admitted to mistakes in auditing its subsidiary and agreed to pay more than $2.9 billion (~$ in ) in fines.

===Financing of Venezuela despite human rights violations (2017)===
In May 2017, Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion (~$ in ) of PDVSA 2022 bonds from the Central Bank of Venezuela during the 2017 Venezuelan protests, when the country was suffering from malnutrition and hyperinflation. Venezuelan politicians and protesters in New York opposed to President of Venezuela Nicolás Maduro accused Goldman of being of complicit of human rights abuses under the government and declared that the financing would fuel hunger in Venezuela by depriving the government of foreign exchange to import food, leading the securities to be dubbed &quot;hunger bonds.&quot; The opposition-led National Assembly voted to ask the United States Congress to investigate the deal, which they called &quot;immoral, opaque, and hypocritical given the socialist government&#x27;s anti-Wall Street rhetoric&quot;. National Assembly president Julio Borges said that the funds would &quot;strengthen the brutal repression&quot; used against the protestors. Sheila Patel, CEO of Goldman Sachs Asset Management&#x27;s international division, said that the incident was a learning experience that taught the bank to focus on environmental, social, and corporate governance issues.

<text>Highland Park distillery is an Island single malt Scotch whisky distillery located in Kirkwall on the Orkney Islands, Scotland. 

Is the second northernmost single malt Scotch whisky distillery in Scotland.

==History==
Highland Park distillery was founded by Magnus Eunson, a butcher and church officer by day and illicit distiller and whisky smuggler by night. In 1798 he was caught illegally distilling whisky on the site. In 1826, nearly 30 years later, Highland Park received an official licence to distill whisky. The name of the distillery does not refer to the Scottish Highlands, but rather to the fact that the distillery was founded on an area called &#x27;High Park&#x27; distinguished from a lower area nearby.

In 1937, Highland Park distillery was sold to James Grant &amp; Sons of Glasgow.

In 1979, the distillery was purchased by The Edrington Group, that also owned The Macallan distillery.

In February 2023, Highland Park released a 54-year-old Single Malt Scotch whisky to celebrate Highland Park&#x27;s 225th anniversary.
== Production ==
The distilling process at Highland Park is the same as that used at other distilleries.

Highland Park uses the local peat, which contains a higher proportion of heather than many other peats. The whisky is aged in sherry casks made of either American or European oak, purchased from Oloroso sherry producers in Spain.

== Awards ==
Highland Park has been named &quot;The Best Spirit in the World&quot; on three occasions by F. Paul Pacult, America&#x27;s foremost expert on distilled spirits. Its 25-year-old whisky was the first spirit ever to receive a perfect 100-point score at the Ultimate Spirits Challenge. In 2018, two of its special distillery releases, The Light and The Dark, were each awarded a Double Gold medal in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. In 2019 and for the fourth year running, Highland Park won the Chairman&#x27;s Trophy for Best in Category at the Ultimate Spirits Challenge.

In 2018, Highland Park ranked second, behind sister distillery The Macallan, in whisky auction sales driven by growing demand from whisky collectors for the distillery&#x27;s special releases.

<doc id="335247" wikidata="Q131549" url="?curid=335247" title="Claude Simon">
<text>Claude Eugène Henri Simon (; 10 October 1913 – 6 July 2005) was a French novelist and recipient of the 1985 Nobel Prize in Literature.

== Biography ==
Claude Simon was born in Tananarive on the isle of Madagascar. His parents were French, and his father was a career officer who was killed in the First World War. He grew up with his mother and her family in Perpignan in the middle of the wine district of Roussillon. Among his ancestors was a general from the time of the French Revolution.

After secondary school at Collège Stanislas in Paris and brief sojourns at Oxford and Cambridge, he took courses in painting at the André Lhote Academy. He then travelled extensively through Spain, Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy and Greece. In 1936 he went to Barcelona and volunteered in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War. This experience as well as those from the Second World War show up in his literary work. At the beginning of the war, Claude Simon took part in the battle of the Meuse (1940) and was taken prisoner. He managed to escape and joined the resistance movement. At the same time, he completed his first novel, &quot;Le Tricheur&quot; (&quot;The Cheat&quot;, published in 1946), which he had started to write before the war.

He lived in Paris and used to spend part of the year at Salses in the Pyrenees.

In 1960, he was a signatory to the Manifesto of the 121 in favour of Algerian independence. In 1961 Claude Simon received the prize of &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; for &quot;La Route des Flandres&quot; and in 1967 the Prix Médicis for &quot;Histoire&quot;. The University of East Anglia made him an honorary doctor in 1973.

== Writing ==
Much of Claude Simon&#x27;s writing is autobiographical, dealing with personal experiences from World War II and the Spanish Civil War, and his family history. His early novels are largely traditional in form, but with &quot;Le vent&quot; (1957) and &quot;L&#x27;Herbe&quot; (1958) he developed a style associated with the nouveau roman. &quot;La Route de Flandres&quot; (1960), which tells about wartime experiences, earned him the &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; prize and international recognition. In &quot;Triptyque&quot; (1973) three different stories are mixed together without paragraph breaks. The novels &quot;Histoire&quot; (1967), &quot;Les Géorgiques&quot; (1981) and &quot;L&#x27;Acacia&quot; (1989) are largely about Simon&#x27;s family history.

=== Style and influences ===
Simon is often identified with the &quot;nouveau roman&quot; movement exemplified in the works of Alain Robbe-Grillet and Michel Butor, and while his fragmented narratives certainly contain some of the formal disruption characteristic of that movement (in particular &quot;Histoire&quot;, 1967, and &quot;Triptyque&quot;, 1973), he nevertheless retains a strong sense of narrative and character.

In fact, Simon arguably has much more in common with his Modernist predecessors than with his contemporaries; in particular, the works of Marcel Proust and William Faulkner are a clear influence. Simon&#x27;s use of self-consciously long sentences (often stretching across many pages and with parentheses sometimes interrupting a clause which is only completed pages later) can be seen to reference Proust&#x27;s style, and Simon moreover makes use of certain Proustian settings (in &quot;La Route des Flandres&quot;, for example, the narrator&#x27;s captain de Reixach is shot by a sniper concealed behind a hawthorn hedge or &quot;haie d&#x27;aubépines&quot;, a reference to the meeting between Gilberte and the narrator across a hawthorn hedge in Proust&#x27;s &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot;).

The Faulknerian influence is evident in the novels&#x27; extensive use of a fractured timeline with frequent and potentially disorienting analepsis (moments of chronological discontinuity), and of an extreme form of free indirect speech in which narrative voices (often unidentified) and streams of consciousness bleed into the words of the narration. The ghost of Faulkner looms particularly large in 1989&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Acacia&quot;, which uses a number of non-sequential calendar dates covering a wide chronological period in lieu of chapter headings, a device borrowed from Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;.

=== Themes ===
Despite these influences, Simon&#x27;s work is thematically and stylistically highly original. War is a constant and central theme (indeed it is present in one form or another in almost all of Simon&#x27;s published works), and Simon often contrasts various individuals&#x27; experiences of different historical conflicts in a single novel; World War I and the Second World War in &quot;L&#x27;Acacia&quot; (which also takes into account the impact of war on the widows of soldiers), the French Revolutionary Wars and the Second World War in &quot;Les Géorgiques&quot;.

In addition, many of the novels deal with the notion of family history, those myths and legends which are passed down through generations and which conspire in Simon&#x27;s work to affect the protagonists&#x27; lives. In this regard, the novels make use of a number of leitmotifs which recur in different combinations between novels (a technique also employed by Marguerite Duras), in particular, the suicide of an eighteenth-century ancestor and the death of a contemporary relative by sniper-fire. Finally, almost all of Simon&#x27;s novels feature horses; Simon was himself an accomplished equestrian and fought in a mounted regiment during World War II (the ridiculousness of mounted soldiers fighting in a mechanised war is a major theme of &quot;La Route des Flandres&quot; and &quot;Les Géorgiques&quot;).

Simon&#x27;s principal obsession, however, is with the ways in which humans experience time (another Modernist fascination). The novels often dwell on images of old age, such as the decaying &#x27;LSM&#x27; or the old woman (that &#x27;flaccid and ectoplasmic Cassandra&#x27;) in &quot;Les Géorgiques&quot;, which are frequently seen through the uncomprehending eyes of childhood. Simon&#x27;s use of family history equally attempts to show how individuals exist &quot;in history&quot;—that is, how they might feel implicated in the lives and stories of their ancestors who died long ago.

=== Criticism ===
In his book, &quot;Orwell&#x27;s Victory,&quot; essayist Christopher Hitchens criticised Simon&#x27;s deconstruction in &quot;Les Géorgiques&quot; of George Orwell&#x27;s account of the Spanish Civil War, pointing out that Orwell had fought alongside POUM, while Simon had fought &quot;on the side of the Stalintern forces&quot;. Hitchens&#x27; criticism has itself been criticised by historian Roseanna Webster.

<doc id="335248" wikidata="Q225554" url="?curid=335248" title="Henrik Pontoppidan">
<text>Henrik Pontoppidan (; 24 July 1857 – 21 August 1943) was a Danish realist writer who shared with Karl Gjellerup the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1917 for &quot;his authentic descriptions of present-day life in Denmark.&quot; Pontoppidan&#x27;s novels and short stories — informed with a desire for social progress but despairing, later in his life, of its realization — present an unusually comprehensive picture of his country and his epoch. As a writer he was an interesting figure, distancing himself both from the conservative environment in which he was brought up and from his socialist contemporaries and friends. He was the youngest and in many ways the most original and influential member of the Modern Break-Through.

==Early life and career==

The son of a Jutlandic vicar and belonging to an old family of vicars and writers, Pontoppidan gave up an education as an engineer, worked as a primary school teacher and finally became a freelance journalist and full-time writer, making his debut in 1881.

The first phase of his work constitutes rebellious social criticism, and as such was also a revolt against his own privileged family background. In a famous quote, Henrik Pontoppidan mocked the historic latinisation of his own surname Pontoppidan from its original Danish root &quot;Broby.&quot;

In matter-of-fact short stories, he mercilessly describes the life of the peasants and country proletarians, with whom he lived in close contact. He was perhaps the first Danish progressive writer to break with an idealised portrayal of farmers. The tales from this era are collected in &quot;Landsbybilleder&quot; (&quot;Village Pictures&quot;, 1883) and &quot;Fra Hytterne&quot; (&quot;From the Huts&quot;, 1887). An important part is his 1890 political collection of short stories &quot;Skyer&quot; (&quot;Clouds&quot;), a biting description of Denmark under the authoritarian semi-dictatorship of the Conservatives both condemning the oppressors and scorning the Danes’ lack of disaffection. After this period he increasingly concentrated on psychological and naturalist problems without giving up his social engagement. Pontoppidan&#x27;s 1889 review &quot;Messias&quot; and 1890 piece &quot;Den gamle Adam&quot; were anonymously published and triggered a controversy after being denounced as blasphemous. The publisher, newspaper editor Ernst Brandes, was fined 300 kroner for &quot;Messias&quot; in December 1891 and committed suicide in 1892.

==Family==
His first wife was Mette Marie Hansen, a woman from a farming family in northern Zealand, with whom he had three children, one of whom died at a young age. The couple separated in 1889, after Pontoppidan met Antoinette Caroline Elise Kofoed. He married Kofoed in 1892, and they had a daughter and a son. Kofoed, who struggled with poor health, died in 1928. Pontoppidan had to provide for two families, which presented many difficulties. Both of his sons emigrated, one to the U.S. and one to Brazil.

==Main works==
The three novels which are normally considered to be Pontoppidan&#x27;s main works were written from about 1890 to 1920. In these works he established on his own terms a Danish version of the &quot;broad description of society&quot; novel in the tradition of Balzac and Zola. Centred on a hero he paints a picture of Denmark in the era of the Constitutional Struggle between Conservative and Liberals, rising industrialisation, cultural conflicts and awakening revolutionary movements.
* &quot;Det forjættede Land&quot; (I-III 1891–95, English translation of vol. I-II &quot;The Promised Land&quot; 1896), describes a fantasist and his dream of being a preacher in the country which leads to self-deception and insanity.
* The partly autobiographical &quot;Lykke-Per&quot; (1898–1904) (&quot;Lucky Per&quot;), perhaps his most famous novel, deals with the self-confident, richly gifted man who breaks with his religious family in order to be an engineer and a conqueror, free of heritage and milieu. However, at the height of his success, they at last catch up with him and he gives up his career to find himself in solitude.
* The bitter &quot;De dødes Rige&quot; (1912–16, &quot;The Realm of the Dead&quot;) shows Denmark after the apparent victory of democracy in 1901, a society in which political ideals are mouldering, capitalism is marching on and press and art are prostituted, all centred about the hopeless love and reform plans of a young progressive squire afflicted by illness.

==Other works==
Pontoppidan&#x27;s last large novel &quot;Mands Himmerig&quot; (1927, &quot;Man’s Heaven&quot;) is an almost desperate description of the crisis of a Danish intellectual at the time of the outbreak of World War I.

Pontoppidan also wrote many short novels and long tales in which he discussed political, psychological and sexual themes.

&quot;Isbjørnen&quot; (1887, &quot;The Polar Bear&quot;) describes the confrontation between an outspoken vicar from Greenland and his narrow-minded Danish provincial clergymen.

&quot;Mimoser&quot; (1886, Engl. transl. &quot;The Apothecary’s Daughters&quot;, 1890) is an ironic-tragic tale about the exaggerated intolerance of unfaithfulness.

&quot;Nattevagt&quot; (1894, &quot;Night Watch&quot;) deals with a courageous and revolutionary artist who is nevertheless a frustrated failure as a husband. Pontoppidan drew on the life of his friend the painter L. A. Ring for the portrait of the artist Thorkild Drehling, Ring considered it a betrayal of trust and broke off the friendship.

&quot;Den gamle Adam&quot; (1894, &quot;The Old Adam&quot;) deals with both men&#x27;s fear of women and of sexuality as a whole.

&quot;Ørneflugt&quot; (1899, &quot;Eagles flight&quot;) is a direct commentary on Hans Christian Andersens The Ugly Duckling with the opposite morale. An eagle brought up in a barnyard grows fat and eventually dies crashlanding into a dungpile - the morale being that you may very well have been born in an eagle&#x27;s egg but that won&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re brought up in a barnyard.

&quot;Borgmester Hoeck og Hustru&quot; (1905, Engl. transl. &quot;Burgomaster Hoeck and His Wife&quot;, 1999) portrays a tragic marriage dominated by the husband&#x27;s jealousy and dislike of his wife&#x27;s joy in life.

A central theme in most of these tales is the difficulties of handling the new tolerance, open-mindedness and democratisation which are introduced by both the transition of society and by literature. Another theme is the conflict between the introverted and closed male nature and the vitality of the woman. Behind all this lies the classic naturalist theme of heritage and milieu against which man has to rebel without quite denying their existence. In his later works he sometimes seems to become a mixture of a castigator of society and a prophet of doom.

Between 1933 and 1943 Pontoppidan wrote two different versions of his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, in which he tried to define his own view of his personal development. Though handicapped by blindness and deafness in later life, he continued to take an interest in politics and cultural life until his final years.

==Literary and cultural influence==

As a stylist Pontoppidan has been described a born naturalist. His language looks plain, simple and easy but is often loaded with symbols and secret hints, hidden irony and “objective” descriptions. He often revised previous works, simplifying them but also changing their plot or sharpening their attitude.

In spite of being well known as a man of positions and attitudes Pontoppidan remains one of the most discussed modern Danish writers. This is partly because of his personal character. Pontoppidan was a man of many paradoxes: a clear liberal in his time, but a stern patriot, an anti-clerical puritan, a disillusioned fighting nature, collaborating with socialists but always from an independent and individualist position. But it is also partly due to his style which has often been regarded as ambiguous and impenetrable; his mixture of partiality and objectivity has often confused both readers and critics and in fact liberals, radicals, conservatives, right wingers and socialists have all tried to reflect their own ideals in his works. He has been regarded both as the absolute antagonist of Georg Brandes and as his most congenial pupil.

Among all the authors of the Modern Break-Through, Pontoppidan is probably the most influential and longest living. His social critical writings mark him as a pioneer of 20th Century Danish literature. Cultural conservatives have been inspired by his critique of modernism after World War I. Finally, he set a standard of &quot;novels about society&quot; which remains relevant. Surprisingly, as a Nobel Prize winner of some international renown, contemporary English translations of his novels had been unavailable before the 2010 publication of &quot;Lucky Per&quot; in a translation by Naomi Lebowitz, republished in 2019 in the Everyman&#x27;s Library Contemporary Classics series.

<text>Jacinto Benavente y Martínez (12 August 1866 – 14 July 1954) was one of the foremost Spanish dramatists of the 20th century. He was awarded the 1922 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for the happy manner in which he has continued the illustrious traditions of the Spanish drama&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Madrid, the son of a celebrated pediatrician, he returned drama to reality by way of social criticism: declamatory verse giving way to prose, melodrama to comedy, formula to experience, impulsive action to dialogue and the play of minds. Benavente showed a preoccupation with aesthetics and later with ethics.

A liberal monarchist and a critic of socialism, he was a reluctant supporter of Francoist Spain as the only viable alternative to what he considered the disastrous republican experiment of 1931–1936. In 1936 Benavente&#x27;s name became associated with the assassination of the Spanish poet and dramatist Federico García Lorca. This happened when the Nationalist newspapers &quot;Estampa&quot;, &quot;El Correo de Andalucia,&quot; and &quot;Ideal&quot; circulated a fake news story that Lorca had been killed as a reprisal for the Republican murder of Benavente. Benavente died in Aldeaencabo de Escalona (Toledo) at the age of 87. He never married. According to many sources, he was a gay man.

Jacinto Benavente wrote 172 works. Among his most important works are:
* &quot;El nido ajeno&quot; (&quot;Another&#x27;s Nest&quot;, 1894), comedy, three acts.
* &quot;Gente conocida&quot; (&quot;High Society&quot;, 1896), satirical scenes of modern life, four acts.

<text>All Grown Up! is an American animated television series developed by Kate Boutilier, Eryk Casemiro, and Monica Piper for Nickelodeon. It serves as a sequel to &quot;Rugrats&quot;, and explores the daily lives of protagonist Tommy Pickles, his little brother Dil and his childhood friends, now tweens/adolescents. The concept for the series was based on the &quot;Rugrats&quot; episode &quot;All Growed Up&quot;, which served as the original series&#x27; 10th anniversary special and proved successful with audiences.

The series ran from April 12, 2003, to August 17, 2008, for a total of five seasons, and featured much of the surviving cast from the original series reprising their roles. Several episodes also feature flashbacks of the kids as toddlers.

== Premise ==
The series is set ten years after the events of &quot;Rugrats&quot;. Tommy, Dil, Chuckie, the twins Phil and Lil, Kimi, Angelica, and Susie are now tweens/teens. Episodes often involve the cast dealing with common issues of preteens and teenagers.

== Development and production ==
===&quot;All Growed Up&quot;===
The idea for &quot;All Grown Up!&quot; originated in &quot;All Growed Up&quot;, a television special which aired in 2001 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of &quot;Rugrats&quot; and portrayed the original characters 10 years into the future. The special was nominated for &quot;Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program&quot; in the 2002 Creative Arts Emmy Awards. The special was the highest rated &quot;Rugrats&quot; episode, the highest-rated Nickelodeon program, and cable&#x27;s No. 1 show for the week ending July 22, 2001, with a 7.2 rating equivalent to 12 million viewers. Approximately 70% of all kids aged 2–11 tuned in to watch the special. Nickelodeon president, Herb Scannell, noted that a &quot;Surprising numbers of kids held &quot;Rugrats&quot; parties on Saturday night and watched the show in groups&quot;. The following day, Nickelodeon said &quot;&#x27;We&#x27;ve got to make this a show,&#x27; because of the size of the audience that came to it.&quot; Noting the immediate popularity of the show&#x27;s concept, &quot;All Growed Up&quot; was deemed the network&#x27;s equivalent of the Super Bowl. Nickelodeon made a two-season order of 35 episodes.

Nick&#x27;s press releases for the &quot;Rugrats&quot;&#x27; 10th anniversary noted that the &quot;All Growed Up&quot; special was a &quot;one time only&quot; special. Nickelodeon was so impressed by the high ratings, they wanted to use the show as a pilot for either a regular spinoff series or a series of occasional one-hour specials. Nickelodeon decided to commission an entire series around the teenage main characters. Arlene Klasky explained &quot;It got enormous ratings, so Nickelodeon blessed us with another series&quot;. Margie Cohn felt that &quot;Rugrats&quot; had endured prolonged success due to the &quot;series&#x27; writing, and the appeal of the show&#x27;s well developed characters to its deeply devoted audience&quot;, and argued the sequel resulted from fan support and speculation on how the characters would age.

While Nickelodeon executives were concerned that the new series would maintain the &quot;Rugrats&quot; appeal, they acknowledged a revision to the successful franchise was necessary as the original series was beaten in the ratings by shows such as &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius&quot; and &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. On October 16, 2001, a PC game based on the &quot;All Growed Up&quot; special was released. After release in the US &amp; Canada, &quot;All Growed Up&quot; debuted on Canadian television by YTV, Rugrats&#x27; English broadcaster in Canada, on September 3, 2001. The French Canadian version, &quot;Les Razmoket, Dix Ans Après&quot;, was broadcast in two parts on VRAK.TV, on December 1, 2001, and December 8, 2001. In Britain and Australia, the video was released as &quot;Older and Bolder&quot;, because a Rugrats video existed in those countries named &quot;All Growed Up&quot;. An &quot;All Growed Up&quot; book was also released.

=== Production ===

Nickelodeon ordered 13 episodes, to be created by &quot;Rugrats&quot; animation studio Klasky Csupo for production in September 2002. &quot;All Grown Up!&quot; was intended as the first &quot;Rugrats&quot; spinoff as others were under consideration. The series premiered with its first episode, &quot;Coup DeVille&quot;, on April 12, 2003, following the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards. By November 2003, &quot;Rugrats&quot; was no longer in production. In 2004, &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;All Grown Up!&quot; were aired concurrently to highlight the characters in two stages of their lives. &quot;All Grown Up!&quot; aired twice per week.

The new episodes shifted from the 11-minute &quot;Rugrats&quot; format of two stories per episode, to a single 22-minute story. This was to allow &quot;more time to develop and tell a story and see where the characters go with it&quot;. Each of the episodes focused on the life of a main character and usually showed the characters facing a lot of firsts for tweens and teenagers. The show included gradual stylistic changes, with the first 13 episodes similar to the &quot;All Growed Up&quot; special and the original &quot;Rugrats&quot; world. The second set of 13 episodes and onward had a more contemporary look, with characters being given &quot;hipper&quot; clothing. Over the 3 seasons of 35 episodes, the developers hoped for a gradual evolution in style to where the audience will be comfortable with the changes. The main cast recorded their parts for each episode in about one hour. By November 24, 2003, 15 episodes began airing while 10 more episodes were in the scripting stage.

== Episodes ==

=== Special Episodes / Television Films ===
* &quot;All Growed Up&quot; (2001)
* &quot;Interview With A Campfire&quot; (2004)
* &quot; Dude, Where&#x27;s My Horse?&quot; (2005)
* &quot;R.V. Having Fun Yet?&quot; (2005)

=== Casting and the evolution of characterization ===
The existing cast modified their voices for their characters&#x27; new ages. Tommy&#x27;s voice actress, E.G. Daily, noted &quot;It was a little harder when we were doing the first batch of episodes, when they were just coming in and trying to define everybody and how they&#x27;ve grown&quot;. Susie&#x27;s character changes included having &quot;a little more sass, a little less innocence and a little more bottom end&quot;. &quot;All Grown Up!&quot; attracted 30 million viewers a month, including a large number of 12 to 14-year-olds. The producers did not delve into the &quot;characters&#x27; loss of innocence&quot; with topics such as sex and drugs in favor of issues relevant to 9 to 11-year-olds, the show&#x27;s target demographic. While the producers did not take the teen approach with &quot;All Grown Up!,&quot; they did with another Klasky Csupo show &quot;As Told by Ginger&quot;.

Executive producer Arlene Klasky stated &quot;It was always in the back of our minds that we would love to see what these characters were like as they grew&quot;. Susie&#x27;s voice actor, Cree Summer, noted that while part of the appeal to this kind of TV show is not growing up, she noted a natural evolution of the show after 12 years on the air. Daily said that while her character was still the star of the show, he was older, wiser, and using more contemporary language. Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon&#x27;s executive vice president and general manager at the time, said &quot;The tween special proved kids are ready to embrace these beloved characters in a whole new realm. The &quot;Rugrats&quot; property is 11 years old, so it feels just right to have the babies turn into tweens in their 12th year on the air&quot;. On the evolution of Angelica, Marjorie Cohn, executive vice president for development and original programming at Nickelodeon explained: &quot;She&#x27;s the center of the universe, and she keeps bumping up against forces that tell her she&#x27;s not. The writers mellowed Angelica and her voice actress addressed &quot;I welcome the new development in her character, the way she can be vulnerable. She&#x27;s getting some real acting challenges from the material the writers are coming up with&quot;. She compared her role to Bart Simpson&#x27;s voice actress who will likely play the 10-year-old until retirement, noting that now she could play the same character with a &quot;bit more sophistication&quot;. She&#x27;s become more vulnerable and has to learn to navigate the social strata of junior high&quot;. The potential for more sophisticated storytelling was one of the factors in the creation of the series. The show&#x27;s creators thought that &quot;pushing the show to the next age bracket&quot; would be an effective way of &quot;holding on to viewers who have grown up with &quot;Rugrats&quot;&quot;. Daily stated: &quot;I&#x27;m definitely going to miss doing [baby Tommy], but it&#x27;s awesome watching people grow.&quot;

=== Other proposed spin-offs ===

At the Television Critics Association tour in July 2001, Nickelodeon executives mentioned that &quot;All Growed Up&quot; was one of three spinoff concepts proposed by Nickelodeon to continue the successful &quot;Rugrats&quot; franchise. In 2002, Nickelodeon aired the episode &quot;Pre-School Daze&quot;, the pilot for a series in which Angelica and Susie attend preschool. According to &quot;Variety&quot; in September 2002, the show was to be repurposed as a series of four standalone specials. The program aired in the UK in 2005. The North American debut took place in late 2008 after the cancellation of the series. Another proposed spinoff was a series featuring Susie and the Carmichael family, who would move from California to Atlanta, Georgia; it was first proposed for the 1999–2000 television season, but Nickelodeon and Klasky-Csupo decided instead to concentrate on all the original-aged &quot;Rugrats&quot;. The Kwanzaa special, which aired in 2001, served as a pilot for this new series, but the series would have contradicted the established continuity.

In the twelfth episode of &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;, &quot;Lucky 13&quot;, Angelica becomes a teenager. When asked if the popularity of that episode would produce a spinoff as the characters enter teendom, Nickelodeon executives explained: &quot;It has been talked about but said the network had no immediate plans to push the entire cast into puberty&quot;, though noted that those connected with the franchise were &quot;eager to continue developing the characters&quot;. The show was preceded by a six-hour marathon of Angelica-centered episodes of &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;. Angelica&#x27;s voice actor Cheryl Chase expressed a desire to take part in any spin-off of &quot;Rugrats&quot;, from &quot;Angelica Goes to College&quot; to &quot;Rugrats in the Nursing Home&quot;. In 2003, Cohn proposed that &quot;Rugrats&quot; characters&#x27; play the leads in classic fairy tales for Nickelodeon.

=== Premieres with other networks ===
A preview show premiered on April 12, 2003, before its regular run began on May 23, 2003. More than 5.2 million viewers watched the regular run, being in 2nd place behind an NFL game on ESPN, and making it the highest-rated premiere at Nickelodeon&#x27;s to date. The show aired in reruns on &quot;Nick on CBS&quot; for six months from March 13, 2004, to September 11, 2004. In addition, in its first season, &quot;All Grown Up!&quot; had its first of two celebrity guest stars: Lil Romeo as &quot;Lil Q&quot; (Cupid) in episode 8, &quot;It&#x27;s Cupid, Stupid&quot;. The German broadcast premiered on August 21, 2006, on Nick. In November 2006, &quot;All Grown Up!&quot; was removed from the schedule, until the remaining episodes aired from November 12, 2007, to August 17, 2008.

== Reception ==
The debut show was in the top 15 ratings spots. Common Sense Media felt that the show&#x27;s scenarios were not as good as in the original series, commenting that they were &quot;thoughtfully crafted&quot; but lacked the satiric take of babies misunderstanding the adult world. Rather, the show was choosing to tackle more standard pre-teen themes. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated it was &quot;a revolutionary idea&quot; for a series with characters perpetually stuck in their status quo. &quot;Image&quot; felt &quot;All Grown Up!&quot; was the &quot;natural progression of the show&quot;&quot;.&quot; &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; felt it was an &quot;ill-advised venture&quot;. &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; commented &quot;The sense of adventure and exploration of the original had been lost, those special personalities they had as babies vanished in a haze of pre-pubescent insecurities&quot;, though felt it was a &quot;fun &#x27;what-if&#x27;&quot;. New York University argued the show did not pursue the character&#x27;s progression with a sense of accuracy. The Gamer thought it was a &quot;terrible excuse for a sequel&quot;. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that in the new series, Angelica has &quot;become an overbearing teen, still bossing around Tommy and his chums&quot;.

&quot;Rugrats&quot; co-creator/co-writer Paul Germain (who left the series in 1993) has stated that he disliked &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;. Since the original series was about babies who do not understand the world, he felt that if the characters are older, then the story is finished. He additionally stated &quot;What I would have said to people at the time if I had been asked, was I would have said, &#x27;If you make them teenagers, there is no &quot;Rugrats&quot;, you&#x27;re wasting your time&#x27;&quot;.

<text>Alexis Leger (; 31 May 1887 – 20 September 1975), better known by his pseudonym Saint-John Perse (; also Saint-Leger Leger), was a French poet, writer and diplomat, awarded the 1960 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for the soaring flight and the evocative imagery of his poetry which in a visionary fashion reflects the conditions of our time&quot; 

== Early life ==
Alexis Leger was born in Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe. His great-grandfather, Prosper Louis Léger, a solicitor, had settled in Guadeloupe in 1815. His grandfather and father were also solicitors; his father was also a member of the city council. The Leger family owned two plantations, one of coffee (La Joséphine) and the other of sugar (Bois-Debout). St. Léger described his childhood on Guadeloupe as &quot;the son of a family French as only the colonials are French&quot;. Later on, Léger greatly embellished his family origins by changing his surname to the more aristocratic sounding St Léger-Léger and by claiming that his ancestors were an &quot;ancienne noblesse&quot; family who had settled in Guadeloupe in the 17th century. The Léger family were well off and Léger had a happy boyhood. Léger was closer to his warm and loving mother than his cold and distant father. The French scholar Marie-Noëlle Little wrote: &quot;Growing up surrounded by the luxurious fauna and flora of the West Indies, Alexis perhaps could not but develop an interest in nature...&quot;.

After the Spanish-American War that saw the United States annex Puerto Rico and occupy Cuba, rumors were rampant in the French West Indies that the United States would seize the French colonies in the Caribbean. The year 1899, known as the &quot;year of all dangers&quot;, was a period of racial tension on Guadeloupe, with both blacks and whites committing arson in the belief that French rule would soon be ending. The Leger family returned to metropolitan France in 1899 and settled in Pau. The young Alexis felt like an expatriate and spent much of his time hiking, fencing, riding horses, and sailing in the Atlantic. His best subjects as a student were the natural sciences. St Léger always felt very close to nature in general, and he had a special interest in ornithology as birds fascinated him.

St. Léger had a strong sense of being an outsider in France and called himself a &quot;man of the Atlantic&quot; who was equally at home on both sides of the Atlantic. Throughout his life, St Léger had a preference for islands and peninsulas over the mainland, which reflected his sense of being an outsider; his sense of a Guadeloupan identity made him feel that he was very different from other French people. He enrolled at Lycée Louis-Barthou, passed the &quot;baccalauréat&quot; with honours, and began studying law at the University of Bordeaux. As a university student, St Léger worked as the music critic for the &quot;Pau-Gazette&quot;. When his father died in 1907, the resulting strain on his family&#x27;s finances led Leger to temporarily interrupt his studies, but he eventually completed his degree in 1910.

In 1904, he met the poet Francis Jammes at Orthez, who became a close friend. He frequented cultural clubs and met Paul Claudel, Odilon Redon, Valery Larbaud, and André Gide. He wrote short poems inspired by the story of Robinson Crusoe (&quot;Images à Crusoe&quot;) and undertook a translation of Pindar. He published his first book of poetry, &quot;Éloges&quot;, in 1910. The &quot;Éloges&quot; (&quot;Praises&quot;) reflected St. Léger&#x27;s nostalgia for Guadeloupe. The &quot;Éloges&quot; concern a quest by the narrator for the &quot;other shores&quot;, namely &quot;outre-mer&quot; (a place beyond the sea) and &quot;outre-songe&quot; (a place beyond dreams). Much of the &quot;Éloges&quot; are concerned with the &quot;lieux de mémoire&quot; (&quot;sites of memory&quot;) that capture the memories of a past world that no longer exists. At one point, St Léger asks in the &quot;Éloges&quot;: &quot;Other than childhood, what was there in those days that is here no longer?&quot; The tone in the &quot;Éloges&quot; is both dreamy and melancholic as the narrator reflects on his longing for the plantation of his childhood, which is depicted as a paradise lost. The house that St. Léger grew up in is depicted in the &quot;Éloges&quot; as a decaying ruin as his family&#x27;s plantation is being reclaimed by the jungle, while all of the books in the family library have rotted away. The autobiographical nature of the &quot;Éloges&quot; is underscored by a major character in the poems, an authoritarian father who owned the plantation, depicted as having omniscient power over both his family and the plantation.

For St. Léger, only poetry endures and allowed him to recapture the memories of a lost world. The front page of the &quot;Éloges&quot; features the phrase in capital letters &quot;ÉCRIT SUR LA PORTE&quot; (&quot;Written on the door&quot;) and the first poem begins with a description of the door to the plantation house under which the same phrase is written. The door serves literally as an entrance to the house and metaphorically as the entrance to the lost world of St Léger&#x27;s childhood. The chronotope of the &quot;Éloges&quot; is one where his family&#x27;s plantation exists in an idealized world severed from any sense of history, which reflected St Léger&#x27;s discomfort with the fact that his family owned slaves in the past (slavery was abolished in France in 1848). Several passages in the &quot;Éloges&quot; imply an incestuous relationship between the father and the sister of the narrator, such as the line &quot;a man is hard, his daughter tender&quot;; the way that the sister displaces her mother as the principal lady of the household; and references to a deeply shameful family secret that the narrator cannot bring himself to name.

The &quot;Éloges&quot; was almost completely ignored at the time; one of the few writers who paid it any attention was Marcel Proust, who praised St. Léger as a creative young poet. An early success for St Léger occurred in 1912 when he, Larbaud, and Gide were elected to the John Donne Club of London, which sought to encourage innovation in poetry. During a visit to London to celebrate his election to the John Donne Club, St. Léger met the Anglo-Polish writer Joseph Conrad, which greatly encouraged him to pursue a career in poetry. Little wrote about his style: &quot;The poet’s task, he thought, like the scientist&#x27;s, was to capture the universe and human consciousness while remaining outside of the literacy currents of the time&quot;.

== Diplomatic service ==
In 1914, he joined the French diplomatic service, and spent some of his first years in Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom. When World War I broke out, he was a press corps attaché for the government.

=== China: 1916–1921 ===
From 1916 to 1921, he was secretary to the French embassy in Peking. He had a secret relationship with Madame Dan Pao Tchao (née Nellie Yu Roung Ling), although according to the latter, he was just using her for obtaining information from Peking high society.

During his time in Beijing, he lived in a former Taoist temple and &quot;sat with the philosophers and sages&quot; as he phrased it. Using Beijing as his base, he took trips across the Gobi desert and out to France&#x27;s Pacific island colonies. St. Léger was fascinated by the Gobi desert, writing to a friend in France that these &quot;desert expanses have exerted a hold on my thoughts, a fascination which approaches hallucination.&quot; The American poet Archibald MacLeish wrote that in China St. Léger &quot;learned the art by which a man defends his life from others and even himself&quot;. During his time in China, St. Léger wrote his epic poem &quot;Anabase&quot;. The &quot;Anabase&quot; ostensibly concerns an expedition from Beijing through the Gobi desert to reach the sea, which serves as a metaphor, as Little phrased it, &quot;an expedition beyond human boundaries, symbolizing man’s march through time and space and consciousness.&quot; In a letter to André Gide in 1921, he described Beijing as &quot;the astronomical capital of the world, outside of space, outside of time, and ruled by the absolute&quot;. 

When ordered to return to France, St. Léger took the longest and most convoluted route as he travelled over the course of three months across the Yellow Sea, the Pacific Ocean, and the Atlantic Ocean in seven different ships. Shortly after his return to France, St. Léger was ordered to go to Washington D.C. to attend the naval disarmament conference intended to end the naval arms race between the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, and Italy. The conference was also intended to resolve the Shandong question, as the Japanese had laid claim to the former German rights on the Shandong peninsula, claims that were strongly resisted by China. As an expert on China, St. Léger was ordered by his superiors to attend the conference as part of the French delegation.

=== Secretary to Aristide Briand: 1921–32 ===
In 1921 in Washington, DC, while taking part in a world disarmament conference, he was noticed by Aristide Briand, Prime Minister of France, who recruited him as his assistant. In Paris, he got to know the fellow intellectual poet Larbaud, who used his influence to get the poem &quot;&quot; published, written during Leger&#x27;s stay in China. Gide, who was serving as the editor of &quot;La Nouvelle Revue Française&quot;, visited St. Léger and asked him if he had any poems to publish. St. Léger pointed to his trunk and stated: &quot;You may find something in there. Look&quot;. Upon opening the trunk, Gide found the &quot;Anabase&quot;. Leger was warm to classical music and knew Igor Stravinsky, Nadia Boulanger, and Les Six. In Parisian intellectual and artistic circles, St. Léger was considered to be rising poet, and he maintained a close friendship with Marcel Proust, whose work he in turn much admired. As Proust worked on the later volumes of his magnum opus &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot;, St. Léger offered him advice and encouragement. Proust paid St. Léger a tribute in the fourth volume of &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot;, the ominously titled &quot;Sodom et Gomorrah&quot;, where two servants, Marie Gineste and Céleste Albart, find the &quot;Éloges&quot; by St. Léger in the bedroom of the narrator. After reading some of his poems, Céleste states that St. Léger has written riddles instead of poems and tosses the book down in disgust. Despite the apparently unflattering nature of the scene, it was a tribute as the message was that only a gifted few could really appreciate St. Léger&#x27;s poetry.

While in China, Leger had written his first extended poem &quot;Anabase&quot;, publishing it in 1924 under the pseudonym &quot;Saint-John Perse&quot;, which he employed for the rest of his life. He then published nothing for two decades, not even a re-edition of his debut book, as he believed it inappropriate for a diplomat to publish fiction. The &quot;Anabase&quot; was widely ignored upon publication, but was praised by various poets such as T. S. Eliot, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Rainer Maria Rilke as a poem of much visionary power. Though St. Léger wrote only in French, the critical reception of his poems tended to be more positive abroad than in France. St. Léger&#x27;s style of poetry, though modernist, was too idiosyncratic to fit into the main currents of poetry in France at the time.

In 1925, he became the &quot;chef de cabinet&quot; to Briand. St. Léger wrote that Briand had &quot;the boldness of the dream...tempered...by the dictates of common sense&quot; while having the ability to think quickly with the &quot;indifference to the exploitation of success&quot;. St. Léger wrote Briand &quot;had no need of duplicity or violence to win...He hated equally stupidity, cowardice, clumsiness and vulgarity...He hunted with the lightest arms and fished with the finest lines...He brought the refinement of the artist&quot;. St. Léger supported Briand&#x27;s &quot;Locarno policy&quot; of seeking better relations with Germany. As a senior aide to Briand, St. Léger was involved in the talks that led to the Treaty of Locarno in 1925 and the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928. In 1930, St. Léger wrote up a memo for Briand that called upon him to use his attendance at the next session of the League of Nations to speak for a &quot;Federal European Union&quot;. That same year Eliot translated the &quot;Anabase&quot; into English, which first introduced St. Léger to an English-speaking audience.

=== Secretary-General of the French Foreign Office: 1932–1940 ===
After Briand&#x27;s death in 1932, Leger served as the General Secretary (number one civil servant) of the French Foreign Office (Quai d&#x27;Orsay) until 1940. St. Léger was a protégé of Philippe Berthelot, the long-time Secretary-General all through the 1920s, and when Berthelot was forced to retire in the spring of 1932 due to ill health, St. Léger was his chosen successor. Like Briand and Berthelot, St. Léger was in the words of the French historian Marguerite Bastid-Bruguiere a strong believe in international &quot;law and justice&quot; to be enforced by the League of Nations, which he saw as a forum where various international problems could be resolved peacefully via negotiation. Like his mentor Berthelot who also lived in China, St. Léger was a Sinophile and had a strong interest in Chinese culture. St. Léger&#x27;s great hope as secretary-general was to see the Soviet Union and the United States both join the League. St. Léger was described by the British historian D.C. Watt as the &quot;cold genius&quot; of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, a brilliant diplomat whose intelligence and ruthlessness made him invaluable to successive French foreign ministers over an eight-year period. Watt wrote that St. Léger was an excellent diplomat whose talents were negated by the mostly mediocre foreign ministers he served, but that St. Léger promoted a talented cadre of ambassadors that included René Massigli, Charles Corbin, Robert Coulondre, Émile Naggiar and François Charles-Roux. The American historian Elizabeth Cameron wrote: &quot;From the start he was no ordinary diplomat. He was a poet, and as a poet, lived in a world not much frequented by other diplomats. But he was also capable of their world, experienced in many worlds, and not least in the worldly society of the French capital. His courtesy was famous, though not always comfortable, and of a kind to put him out of reach. Many and most of all the worldly and the ambitious, were made uneasy by his aloofness, the subtleties of his language, and the sinuous progressions of his thought&quot;. The British historian Julien Jackson described St. Léger as a rather mysterious character whose most important belief was that France could not afford to be estranged from Britain. St. Léger had a dark complexion and a popular rumor had it that he was of partially African descent, hence his nickname &quot;le mulâtre du quai d’Orsay&quot; (&quot;the mulatto of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay&quot;), which he hated.

The French historian Jean-Baptiste Duroselle described St. Léger as a &quot;strange diplomat&quot;. The eccentric St. Leger was especially noted for his obsession with writing long erotic poems which circulated as manuscripts among his friends celebrating the beauty and sensuality of women and the joys of sex, on which he spent a disproportionate amount of time. The diplomat Jean Chauvel wrote that he would appear at the Quai d&#x27;Orsay &quot;wearing a narrow black tie, with a pasty face, a veiled look in his eyes, using elegant and refined language in a low voice&quot;. Chauvel described St. Léger as a dilettante who talked about Chinese philosophy and poetry just as much as current events. St. Léger normally arrived at work at 11 am, would leave for lunch at noon and only return to the Quai d&#x27;Orsay at 4 pm. Despite his diplomatic duties, St. Léger was often at the Café Procope, where he spoke about the latest in the cultural avant-garde with Jean Cocteau, Paul Morand, and Jean Giraudoux. Morand wrote: &quot;I admire his modesty, his broad sweeping views, his elevated and active mind, his playful imagination and mature wisdom like that of an elderly man, his selflessness, his secret life, his unfurnished apartments filled with trunks and his nomadic childhood&quot;. The columnist André Géraud who wrote under the penname Pertinax wrote that: &quot;He had a deep feeling for the dignity of France, something shared by all the great servants of the State. He was a man of absolute moral and intellectual integrity...Contrary to the accusations that are being leveled, Alexis Léger never took the liberty of trying to impose his own views.&quot; Géraud noted that St. Léger had difficult relations with some of the foreign ministers he served, most notably Pierre Laval, Pierre-Étienne Flandin and especially Georges Bonnet, but that he saw his duty to &quot;educate&quot; the ministers he served.

The first great crisis faced by St. Léger as secretary-general was the Lytton Report, which had concluded that Japan had committed aggression by seizing Manchuria from China in 1931. In 1931, the Chinese delegation at the League of Nations had accused Japan of aggression by conquering Manchuria, which led the League to appoint a commission under Lord Lytton to determine if Japan had committed aggression or not. St. Léger favored having the League General Assembly &quot;approve&quot; and &quot;adopt&quot; the Lytton report, but then leave the resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute to the mediation by the powers that had signed the 9-Power Treaty of 1922 plus Germany and the Soviet Union. In a report St. Léger wrote about the crisis in Asia, he described both Japan and China as both hostile towards France&#x27;s special rights in China, but wrote that Japan was by far the most dangerous of the two. St. Léger wrote that ever since the mid-1920s Japan had been &quot;regressing&quot; towards &quot;Asian particularism&quot;. St. Léger used as an example of Japan&#x27;s &quot;regression&quot; the rather violent police campaign against &quot;western decadence&quot; such as young couples kissing in public (traditionally considered to be disgusting behavior in Japan). Besides for a general hostility towards western values shown by the Japanese state, St. Léger wrote that even more disturbing were the claims of an &quot;Asian Monroe Doctrine&quot; in which all of Asia was considered to be Japan&#x27;s sphere of influence. St. Léger wrote that Japan was steadily moving away from &quot;integration into the entente between the great world powers&quot; and &quot;from the contractual system of the League&quot;. He concluded that Japan was conducting &quot;a systematic program of wild imperialism&quot;, which he predicated might one day cause a war.

St. Léger advocated that France should vote for sanctions against Japan at the League General Assembly as he argued that this was the best way of stopping a war in Asia. St. Léger wrote that the colony of French Indochina, France&#x27;s other colonies in the Pacific, and its special rights in China, especially the French Concession in Shanghai, were profitable and worth defending against Japan. St. Léger wrote the main danger was to French Indochina was the &quot;reorganization on its border, with or against Japan, of an united and disciplined China&quot;. St. Léger argued that French diplomacy had to be careful to not appear to be offering &quot;unqualified approval of Chinese claims and methods&quot; and to avoid a solution that &quot;would push Japan towards extreme methods&quot;. As it was, when the Lytton commission report was presented in March 1933, Japan left the League of Nations in protest. St. Léger&#x27;s advocacy of closer ties with Britain and if possible, the United States as well, were much as motivated by fear of Japan as fear of Germany.

=== From Barthou to Blum ===
Of the all foreign ministers St. Léger served after 1932, only Louis Barthou he respected as he wrote that he had the vision to achieve &quot;the great rules of French diplomacy&quot;. St. Léger wrote that he wanted to maintain the Locarno system as he stated: &quot;The structure of Locarno was for a decade our only cornerstone in Europe; the only one which inspired the respect of Hitler by the precision and strictness of its mechanism, the only one which felt obliged to acknowledge officially and repeatedly until the moment which he discerned the inner weaknesses of the beneficiaries of the system&quot;. In 1934, Barthou initially considered sacking St. Léger as he believed him to be opposed to his policy of seeking an alliance with the Soviet Union, but changed his mind after he discovered St. Léger was the ideal man to conduct the talks with the Soviets.

Barthou&#x27;s plans for an &quot;Eastern Locarno&quot;-which were intended as a cover for an alliance with the Soviet Union-created much opposition in Britain. Between 9–10 July 1934 a French delegation consisting of Barthou; St. Léger; Charles Corbin, the ambassador in London; the Political Director René Massigli; and Roland de Margerie held a conference inLondon with the Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon; Sir Robert Vansittart, the Permanent Undersecretary at the Foreign Office; Sir Anthony Eden, the League of Nations minister; Orme Sargent and Lord Stanhope. Simon ridiculed French fears of Nazi Germany, and when Barthou said an &quot;Eastern Locarno&quot; was necessary to protect France and its allies in Eastern Europe, Simon incredulously replied &quot;To protect yourselves from Germany?&quot; Barthou, known as one of the most tougher French politicians dismissed the British objections while St. Léger and Corbin were more conciliatory. St. Léger spoke of: &quot;the fundamental importance that France attached to her friendship with England. She does not &quot;want&quot; to do anything &quot;against&quot; Great Britain. Better still, the French government does not &quot;wish&quot; to get into anything &quot;without&quot; Great Britain&quot;. St. Léger wrote the assassination of Barthou in Marseilles while greeting King Alexander of Yugoslavia who was also killed was a great blow to French diplomacy as he considered Barthou to be the only effective foreign minister he served.

Barthou&#x27;s successor, Pierre Laval sough an alliance with Italy and was prepared to cede the Aouzou Strip of French Equatorial Africa to the Italian colony of Libya to win the friendship of Benito Mussolini. St. Léger felt that Laval was far too keen for an agreement with Mussolini as he wrote that he only wanted a &quot;voyage de Rome&quot; and put little attention to the details of the agreement, which inspired St. Léger to threaten to resign in protest. St. Léger who went with Laval to Rome for the summit with Mussolini was excluded from the private meetings where Laval essentially gave Mussolini a free hand to invade Ethiopia. Likewise, St. Léger felt that Laval was too keen to make his &quot;voyage de Moscow&quot; to meet Joseph Stalin, which St. Léger wrote was for him was merely a &quot;voyage de cabotin&quot;. When St. Léger objected that more time was needed to prepare for the Franco-Soviet alliance, Laval replied: &quot;Vous couchez avec les affaires&quot;.

St. Léger was a close friend of Edvard Beneš, the long-time foreign minister of Czechoslovakia who became president in 1935, and he tended to take a strong pro-Czechoslovak line. The Canadian historian John Cairns described as St. Leger as a &quot;rather strange&quot; character who chose to undercut policy initiatives that he disapproved of. Between 13 and 15 May 1935, St. Léger went to Moscow with the premier of the republic, Pierre Laval, to sign the Franco-Soviet alliance. Foreign visitors were rarely allowed to see Joseph Stalin in the Kremlin, and it was considered a great honor that Laval and the rest of the French visitors were allowed to meet Stalin along with the premier, Vyacheslav Molotov and the foreign commissar Maxim Litvinov. As was normally the case, Stalin said little and instead phlegmatically smoked his pipe while Molotov and Litvinov did most of the talking. As Litvinov was fluent in French and was more charming than the &quot;hard man&quot; Molotov, St. Léger spoke to him the most. On the return trip to Paris, St. Léger attended the funeral of Poland&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader, Marshal Józef Piłsudski in Warsaw and in Berlin attended Laval&#x27;s meeting with Hermann Göring.

During the Abyssinia Crisis, St. Léger proposed in November 1935 a meeting between the British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare with Laval. On 7–8 December 1935, Hoare met with Laval in Paris where the two agreed to the Hoare–Laval Pact under which Italy would receive two-thirds of Ethiopia in exchange for ending the war. St. Leger was opposed to the Hoare-Laval Pact that essentially rewarded Italy for invading Ethiopia. He saw Laval&#x27;s policy of seeking to improve relations with Italy at the expense of Ethiopia as amoral and sabotaged the Hoare-Laval pact by leaking it to the French press. On 13 December 1935, the columnist Geneviève Tabouis in &quot;L&#x27;Œuvre&quot; and the columnist André Géraud who wrote under the pen-name Pertinax in &quot;L&#x27;Echo de Paris&quot; both broke the story of the Hoare-Laval pact, which led to highly negative reactions in both France and the United Kingdom. In London, the news of the Hoare-Laval pact came very close to bringing down the government of Stanley Baldwin and Hoare was forced to resign in disgrace, being made the &quot;fall guy&quot; as Baldwin lied to the House of Commons by claiming that Hoare was acting on his initiative.

On 7 March 1936, Germany violated both the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Locarno by the remiliziation of the Rhineland. St. Léger called for France to respond by sending a military force to evict the Wehrmacht from the Rhineland as he noted the remiliziation placed France in grave long-term danger. General Maurice Gamelin insisted that only a general mobilization would provide the sufficient force to expel the Wehrmacht from the Rhineland, which as a considerable surprise who thought of a &quot;police operation&quot; to expel the Wehrmacht from the Rhineland. Cameron wrote: &quot;Even severe critics recognize that Léger and the permanent services were determined to preserve demilitarization at whatever cost. Unfortunately, they did not succeed in overcoming the confusions and hesitations which prevailed at the top level&quot;. To discuss the crisis, a meeting of the League Council was called in London. Flandin, who replaced Laval as foreign minister, attended the conference along with St. Léger. St. Léger wrote with disgust that Flandin at the conference followed the &quot;politique de complaisance&quot; and proved all too willing to accept the remiliziation. St. Léger wrote that the British Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden at the conference rolled &quot;a velvet carpet for retreat&quot; by making vague promises of Anglo-French staff talks in return for French acceptance of the remiliziation, an offer which Flandin accepted. St. Léger wrote that the French Army should have marched into the Rhineland as he maintained that the British would have forced to follow suit.

St. Léger noted that Britain had signed both the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Locarno and argued that British honor would have forced the United Kingdom to follow the lead of France in enforcing both treaties with regard to the Rhineland. St. Léger that it was the remiliziation of the Rhineland, not the Munich Agreement, that was the turning point in France&#x27;s fortunes. St. Léger wrote: &quot;It was the London conference of March 1936, not Munich, which must bear the responsibility for Hitler&#x27;s flooding over the banks&quot;. St. Léger noted the remiliziation of the Rhineland altered the balance of power decisively in favor of the &quot;Reich&quot; by exposing France once again to the threat of German invasion and by allowing Germany to refortify the Franco-German border. As long as the Rhineland was demilitarized, western Germany was open to a French offensive, which protected France&#x27;s allies in Eastern Europe such as Czechoslovakia and Poland from German aggression. In his &quot;political testament&quot; written after his return from London, St. Léger wrote that war was &quot;inevitable&quot; as he predicated that Germany would refortify the Franco-German border and invade France&#x27;s allies in Eastern Europe, secure in the knowledge that the Rhineland would be protected from a French offensive. Despite his belief that war was &quot;inevitable&quot;, St. Léger followed a policy he called &quot;irréductible dans l&#x27;irrédutiblité&quot; of seeking to best prepare France for the coming conflict.

After the League of Nations sanctions against Italy ended in July 1936, the French tried hard to revive the Stresa Front, displaying &quot;...an almost humiliating determination to retain Italy as an ally&quot;. The American historian Barry Sullivan wrote &quot;A.J.P. Taylor erred in asserting that the British and the French drove Mussolini into an alliance with Hitler. Ironically, Mussolini responded to Germany, Britain and France in inverse proportion to their degree of dishonesty and their threat to Italy: Germany, which consistently treated Italy worse than did the other two countries, was rewarded with Mussolini&#x27;s friendship; France, which generally offered Italy the highest level of co-operation and true partnership, was rewarded with rebuffs and abuse. British policy and Mussolini&#x27;s reaction to it, fell between these extremes&quot; Both the British and the French very much wanted a rapprochement with Italy to undo the damage caused by the League of Nations sanctions, and Sullivan wrote: &quot;That Mussolini chose to ally with Hitler, rather than being forced.&quot;. St. Léger had a very strong dislike of Fascist Italy and consistently opposed the effort to improve relations with Rome as he argued that Mussolini was set about an anti-French alliance with Germany, and there was nothing that French diplomacy could do to change Mussolini&#x27;s foreign policy choices.

St. Léger was willing to serve the &quot;Front Populaire&quot; government of Léon Blum. He described as &quot;a man of the Left, an opponent of everything antirepublican&quot;. During the Spanish Civil War, St. Léger argued very forcefully to Blum that France needed an alliance with Great Britain and that France could not afford a breach with Britain over the issue of Spain. He therefore argued to Blum that France should cease supplying arms to the Spanish Republic and agree to the British plan for arms embargo on both sides.

=== The strong man of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay ===
Within the Foreign Office he led the optimist faction that believed that Germany was unstable and that if Britain and France stood up to Hitler, he would back down. In October 1936, St. Léger welcomed the new American ambassador to Paris, William Christian Bullitt Jr. who arrived together with his right-hand man Carmel Offie. St. Léger told Bullitt that the French were greatly pleased that the American president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had appointed one of his best friends as ambassador to France, saying he regarded this as a sign that Roosevelt placed much great value on Franco-American relations. St. Léger told Bullitt that he was personally happy that Roosevelt had appointed a man fluent in French as ambassador as he observed for the last 16 years no American ambassador had spoken French, which he took as a sign that Roosevelt valued France, and while also telling the openly gay Offie that homosexuality was legal in France. In January 1937, rumors started to appear in the French newspapers that stated the Wehrmacht was operating in Spanish Morocco. The closeness of Spanish Morocco to the Strait of Gibraltar that linked the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean led the possibility of a German military presence in Spanish Morocco to be considered unacceptable in both Paris and London. As the Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos was out of Paris, St. Léger was in charge of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay and he acted with dispatch, having meeting with the German ambassador Count Johannes von Welczeck, where he protested in the most strongest terms, saying he regarded a German military presence in Spanish Morocco as a threat to French interests. St. Léger was close to the French ambassador in London, Charles Corbin, and had him secure a promise of British support from Robert Vansittart, the Permeant Undersecretary at the Foreign Office. Cameron noted that the Germans were outraged by St. Léger&#x27;s &quot;démarche&quot; as she wrote: &quot;They had felt a strong hand at the helm of French foreign policy and they didn&#x27;t like it. Thus, the incident added another black mark to their dossier on Léger as a public enemy of the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;.

=== The Sudetenland crisis ===
On 5 April 1938, St. Léger attended a conference at the Quai d&#x27;Orsay concerning Eastern Europe alongside Joseph Paul-Boncour the Foreign Minister; Robert Coulondre, the ambassador in Moscow; Léon Noël, the ambassador in Warsaw; Victor de Lacroix, the minister in Prague; Raymond Brugère, the minister in Belgrade; and Adrien Thierry, the minister in Bucharest. The principle conclusion of the conference was that as long as France&#x27;s allies in Eastern Europe continued to feud with each other, no resistance to Nazi Germany was possible. The conference ended with a plan being adopted to see it if was possible for King Carol II of Romania to allow the Red Army transit rights across Romania to aid Czechoslovakia in the event of a German invasion, which in turn led to Coulondre and Thierry being assigned to find a way to end the Bessarabia dispute as Carol would not allow the Red Army to enter his kingdom as long as the Soviet Union continued to claim Bessarabia. Much anger was expressed during the conference at the Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Józef Beck, whose attitude towards Czechoslovakia was hostile at best and who was utterly against granting the Red Army transit rights across Poland to aid Czechoslovakia in the event of a German invasion.

On 10 April 1938, a new government under Édouard Daladier was formed. Joseph Paul-Boncour, a foreign minister whom St. Léger felt was well meaning, but ineffectual did not retain his portfolio in the new cabinet. Paul-Boncour was replaced with Georges Bonnet, whom St. Léger later wrote was the worse of the many foreign ministers he served. St. Léger described Bonnet as very intelligent, but secretive, scheming, duplicitous and committed to a policy of ending the French alliance system in Eastern Europe that he was opposed to. One diplomat recalled that Bonnet and St. Léger had &quot;no rapport&quot;. St. Léger favored &quot;la ligne anglaise&quot; (&quot;the English line&quot;) of seeking closer ties with Britain. St. Léger favored the British policy during the Sudetenland crisis of seeking concessions from Beneš out of the belief that ultimately the Chamberlain government would come to see that Adolf Hitler was the problem in Czechoslovak-German relations after Beneš made enough concessions, and then swing around to the support of Czechoslovakia. He accompanied the French Premier Édouard Daladier at the Munich Conference in 1938, where the timetable of the cession of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia to Germany was agreed to. The British historian Robert Payne wrote: &quot;The hero of the Munich conference was Alexis St. Léger, the permanent secretary of the French Foreign Office , who kept urging Daladier to resist Hitler&#x27;s demands , but Daladier was too stunned , too sunk in melancholy , to pay much him attention&quot;. Paul Schmidt, who served as Hitler&#x27;s interpreter (Hitler did not speak French), recalled that St. Léger kept raising objections at the Munich Conference, much to Hitler&#x27;s annoyance.

=== From Munich to Danzig ===
In October 1938, the pro-appeasement Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet carried out a purge of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, sidelining a number of officials opposed to his policy. In the aftermath of the purge, Bonnet was congratulated by the equally pro-appeasement British ambassador Sir Eric Phipps for removing the &quot;warmongers&quot; René Massigli and Pierre Comert from the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, but he went on to complain that Bonnet should have sacked Secretary-General St. Léger as well. In response, Bonnet claimed that he and St. Léger saw &quot;eye to eye&quot; about the policy to be pursued towards Germany and Italy. Phipps, who knew about the true state of relations between the two, drily noted that &quot;in that case the eyes must be astigmatic&quot;. In fact, Bonnet had very much wanted to sack St. Léger, but the latter was protected by his friendship with Daladier. Phipps-who believed that appeasement was the only way to save Western civilization-greatly disliked St. Léger for his anti-appeasement views. On 24 October 1938, Phipps reported to Lord Halifax: &quot;I saw him [St. Léger] this afternoon and found him convinced as ever that no arrangement could be reached between France and Germany or Italy. In fact, his point of view remains entirely sterile&quot;. Contrary to Bonnet&#x27;s policy of seeking to end the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, in November 1938, St. Léger played a key role in sending out a French mission to Yugoslavia, Romania and Bulgaria to increase French economic influence in the Balkans.

On 6 December 1938, St. Léger was present in the Clock Room of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay standing alongside Count von Welczeck as he watched the Declaration of Franco-German Friendship that was signed by Bonnet and the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. St. Léger was shocked that Ribbentrop brought along with him to Paris 600 academic experts, who played no role during the Franco-German summit, and whose only purpose was to show the power of Ribbentrop. During the visit of Ribbentrop, he and Bonnet went out for a walk in the Tuileries Garden where Bonnet was said to have told Ribbentrop that the French alliance system in Eastern Europe was over and that France now recognized Eastern Europe as being within Germany&#x27;s exclusive sphere of influence. St. Léger who was present during the walk in the Tuileries Garden denied that Bonnet made that claim and instead stated that Bonnet had actually said was that France now recognized Czecho-Slovakia as being in the German sphere of influence. Regardless of what Bonnet actually said, Ribbentrop upon his return to Berlin told Hitler that France now accepted that Eastern Europe was within the sphere of influence of the &quot;Reich&quot; and there was no danger of France going to war for Poland.

When Germany violated the Munich Agreement on 15 March 1939 by occupying the Czech half of Czecho-Slovakia which was turned into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, St. Léger was outraged and argued that Robert Coulondre, the ambassador in Berlin, should be recalled in protest to show the Germans &quot;the seriousness of the situation&quot;. In an unusual move, he met privately with Daladier to complain about &quot;the weak attitude and hesitancy of M. Bonnet, and against his being himself &#x27;surrounded with reticence&#x27;&quot; as he charged that Bonnet kept him in the dark about what he was doing. When Bonnet went to London to see Chamberlain and Lord Halifax four days later, St. Léger was ordered to stay in Paris as Bonnet felt that St. Léger would take a different line with the British than what he favored. In a memo he wrote about the &quot;probable attitude&quot; of Britain and Poland, St. Léger wrote that the foreign policy of Colonel Beck was entirely &quot;cynical and false&quot;, and that Beck wanted a military alliance with Britain, which he believed the British would refuse. St. Léger further predicated that Beck would follow his usual &quot;hand-to-mouth policy&quot; and moved closer to the &quot;Reich&quot; when the Chamberlain government refused to &quot;undertake a definite commitment&quot; to defend Poland. Regarding the United Kingdom, St. Léger predicated that &quot;France and Great Britain were at the turning of the road&quot;.

=== The Danzig crisis ===
During the Danzig crisis, St. Léger very much favored Daladier&#x27;s plans for a &quot;peace front&quot; of the Soviet Union, France and the United Kingdom to deter Germany from invading Poland. During the Tilea Affair of March 1939 when France&#x27;s ally Romania appeared to be on the brink of a German invasion to seize its oil wells, St. Léger was furious with Colonel Beck, whose statements implied that Poland would not assist Romania as Beck noted that the Romanian-Polish alliance only applied against the Soviet Union, not Germany. At a meeting with Juliusz Łukasiewicz, the Polish ambassador in Paris, St. Léger expressed his rage, saying: &quot;Poland refuses to join France and England in protecting Romania&quot;. St. Léger sent a long letter to both the British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and the prime minister Neville Chamberlain that denounced Colonel Beck as a ruthless, unscrupulous and devious opportunist whose word was not to be trusted and who was about to ally Poland to the &quot;Reich&quot;. At a meeting with Phipps, St. Léger expressed the hope that Britain would not &quot;put the cart before the horse&quot; by subordinating decision-making to King Carol II of Romania, whom St. Léger distrusted almost as much as he distrusted Beck. St. Léger had a dismissive view of France&#x27;s allies in Eastern Europe as he told Phipps: &quot;These governments would decide their attitude in accordance with the intentions of France and Great Britain. In any case, they were only what he called &#x27;corollaries&#x27;&quot;.

Starting on 18 March 1939, St. Léger took to cultivating American public opinion by using 25, 000 francs to cover the travel expense to send out various English-speaking French cultural figures such as André Maurois, Ève Curie, Jules Romains, and Georges Duhamel to tour the United States. St. Léger believed that the promise of American support would be essential to allow France to face the &quot;Reich&quot; in the Danzig crisis, and he felt that such cultural diplomacy using the historical relationship between France and the United States as well their shared democratic values would win the American public over to a more favorable view of France. Much to St. Léger&#x27;s surprise, on 31 March 1939, Chamberlain reversed his long-standing policy of &quot;no commitments beyond the Rhine&quot; by announcing in the House of Commons the famous British &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland.

In the Danzig crisis, relations between Bonnet and Daladier became increasing strained and hostile as the two men held diametrically opposed views about whatever France should go to war for Poland. Starting in April 1939, Daladier worked to marginalise Bonnet by dealing directly with St. Léger and entirely by-passing the foreign minister. St. Léger knew from the reports of the &quot;Deuxième Bureau&quot; that the Chamberlain government was deeply worried about the prospect of Japan taking advantage of a war in Europe to seize Britain&#x27;s Asian colonies and threaten Australia and New Zealand, and wanted American support in the Pacific. On 11 April 1939, Lord Halifax had written a letter to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt asking him to move the U.S. Atlantic fleet to the Pacific to dissuade the Japanese from taking advantage of the Danzig crisis, a request that Roosevelt had refused. Knowing that the British would be more active in Europe if the Americans were more involved in Asia, St. Léger met with William Christian Bullitt Jr., the American ambassador in Paris and a close friend of Roosevelt&#x27;s, to tell him that the &quot;Deuxième Bureau&quot; was aware of a secret German-Japanese plan that Japan would attack the European colonies in Asia the moment Germany invaded Poland. Prying on American stereotypes of Britain, St. Léger told Bullitt that pressure from the city had led Chamberlain to decide to send the main part of the Royal Navy to Singapore (the major British naval base in Asia) and accordingly the Danzig crisis was more likely to end in war. Bullitt-who talked on the telephone on a daily basis with Roosevelt-accordingly passed on these claims to Roosevelt, who reversed himself and ordered much of the U.S. Atlantic fleet transferred over the Pacific fleet. St. Léger himself was concerned about the Japanese as he noted that in February 1939 the Japanese had occupied the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, which placed Japanese forces very close to French Indochina while France could spare no naval forces for Asia because of the crisis in Europe.

On 14 April 1939, Roosevelt had written Hitler a letter asking him to promise not to attack any more countries. On 28 April 1939, Hitler in an address to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; mocked Roosevelt by reading out the response of 34 world leaders who provided the polite answer to requests from German diplomats that their nations did not feel threatened by Germany (though notably the United Kingdom, France, Poland and the Soviet Union were absent from Hitler&#x27;s list). In the aftermath of Hitler&#x27;s speech, St. Léger told Bullitt that Hitler in his speech had responded to Roosevelt&#x27;s request to settle the Danzig crisis peacefully by renouncing the German-Polish nonaggression pact; that the tone of Hitler&#x27;s speech was notably bellicose; and that Hitler had no notion of justice as proven by his &quot;enslavement&quot; of the Czech people. For all reasons, St. Léger predicated that Hitler wanted war over Danzig and asked Bullitt to use his influence with Roosevelt to persuade the president to ask Congress to amend the American Neutrality acts. On 29 April 1939, Bonnet met the Soviet ambassador Jakob Suritz who complained about the &quot;absence of reciprocity in obligations&quot; in Bonnet&#x27;s draft treaty of an Anglo-Soviet-French alliance. Bonnet quite causally claimed to be ignorant of what the draft treaty stated and blamed St. Léger, whom he stated was incompetent and not capable of writing treaties properly.

Between 16 and 19 May 1939, a Polish delegation led by the Military Affairs Minister, General Tadeusz Kasprzycki, visited Paris to strength the Franco-Polish alliance; to work out staff plans if Germany did invade Poland and to facilitate French arms shipments to Poland. General Maurice Gamelin and Kasprzycki signed a military accord, which remained a dead letter as no political accord was signed. Bonnet claimed to Gamelin that the political accord was not ready to be signed as the staff of he Quai d&#x27;Orsay needed more time for the text, but Gamelin discovered that claim was a lie as he phoned St. Léger who stated that he and the rest of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay staff had prepared the political accord several weeks before the Polish delegation arrived. Daladier was on holiday in the south of France, and by the time Gamelin and St. Léger were able to contact him via phone, Kasprzycki and the rest of the Polish delegation had left Paris. Gamelin was stunned by the lengths that Bonnet was prepared to go to find a way to end the alliance with Poland, but St. Léger informed him that this was the norm with Bonnet.

St. Léger had an anti-clerical views and was strongly opposed to the offer of Pope Piux XII to mediate an end to the Danzig crisis. St. Léger told Phipps that most of the senior officials of the Catholic Church hierarchy were closeted gay men who had been blackmailed into working for the Fascist regime. St. Léger called the Pope&#x27;s mediation offer a power play by Mussolini, and stated that Cardinal Maglione, the right-hand man of the Pontiff, was acting as an Italian rather as an agent of the Vatican. St. Léger ended by saying the Vatican should restrict itself to appeals for peace &quot;on a general basis and usual plane for peace&quot; and to &quot;not get involved in political matters which it should leave to the Chancelleries&quot;.

French decision-makers were far more keen on having the Soviet Union join the &quot;peace front&quot; to protect Poland than British decision-makers, and St. Léger was annoyed with the attitude of Chamberlain who continued to insist that Britain would never sign a military alliance with the Soviet Union. On 20 May 1939, Lord Halifax stopped by in Paris on his way to Geneva to attend the spring session of the League of Nations. During his stop-over in Paris, Halifax was confronted by Daladier, Bonnet and St. Léger who told him very firmly that only a military alliance with the Soviet Union could stop Germany from invading Poland, and warned him if Chamberlain continued his foot-dragging, the result would be war in 1939. Halifax came away from his meeting in Paris converted to the French point-of-view and upon his return to London stated that Britain should start talks for an alliance with Moscow. St. Léger very much expected the Anglo-French-Soviet talks for an alliance to be successful. In a meeting with Bullitt on 28 June 1939 St. Léger stated he believed that &quot;there were eighty chances in a hundred&quot; that the Anglo-French-Soviet talks &quot;would be successfully concluded in the near-future&quot;. On 30 June 1939, St. Léger told Bullitt that the best hope of stopping the Danzig crisis from turning into a war were an alliance with the Soviet Union and American military aid to France, especially aircraft. St. Léger warned Bullitt that Hitler seemed very intent on invading Poland and that the only way to stop him would be to amend the American neutrality acts to allow France to buy modern American aircraft and for a &quot;peace front&quot; of the Soviet Union, France and Great Britain.

Ever since the Abyssinia crisis of 1935–1936, it had been French policy to repair relations with Italy, which St. Léger disliked. French plans for a war with Germany required bringing over soldiers from Algeria and the rest of the Maghreb to compensate for the numerical superiority of the Wehrmacht, and the possibility of the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; cutting France off from the Maghreb was considered very concerning in Paris. In a memo, St. Léger wrote that Benito Mussolini had evidently decided upon alignment with Germany and that: &quot;Every effort to bring them [the Italians] back to us is destined to fail; it will only encourage them in their two-faced policy, leading them to name the highest price for their assets and making them value even more highly the benefits the Axis could offer them&quot;. St. Léger complained that allies of Bonnet in his &quot;peace lobby&quot; such as the Public Works minister Anatole de Monzie were holding unofficial talks with Italian diplomats on their own, which he felt was Bonnet&#x27;s way of cutting out the Quai d&#x27;Orsay from his foreign policy. André François-Poncet, the French ambassador in Rome, was opposed to St. Léger&#x27;s policy and felt it was still possible to &quot;detach&quot; the Italians from an alliance with Germany. St. Léger ordered François-Poncet to stick to his &quot;day-to-day business&quot;, which led François-Poncet to lash out against him as he told the Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano that St. Léger was a &quot;sinister man&quot; opposed to better Franco-Italian relations. Phipps had served as the British ambassador in Berlin between 1933 and 1937 where he became a close friend of François-Poncet, who served as the French ambassador in Berlin between 1931 and 1938. All through the spring and summer of 1939, Phipps wrote letters to François-Poncet that accused St. Léger of &quot;Italophobia&quot; and of being rigidly hostile towards the Fascist regime as Phipps noted that St. Léger disliked Mussolini as a person. Both Phipps and François-Poncet believed it was possible to &quot;detach&quot; Fascist Italy from alignment with Nazi Germany, and both felt that St. Léger was the principle man blocking rapprochement with Italy. Cameron wrote that events proved St. Léger correct about Italy as even though the French did not make the concessions to the Italians that Bonnet and François-Poncet favored, Italy still remained neutral when the war began and only entered the war on 10 June 1940 when it was already clear that France was defeated.

St. Léger very much welcomed the change in British policy during the Danzig crisis, as he noted the lack of British support in 1938 had made it &quot;impossible&quot; for France to face Germany on its own. Despite his dislike of Colonel Beck, St. Léger favored a policy of Britain and France making generous loans to Poland to assist with the modernization of the Polish military &quot;...at once in order to convince the Germans that France and England are determined to support Poland if Poland should become involved in a war with Germany&quot;. On 21 July 1939, St. Léger told Philps that Daladier was &quot;firmly convinced of the necessity of showing an irreducible refusal to treat with a regime [Nazi Germany] in whose word no confidence could be placed and with which any treaty must be valueless...so convinced was Daladier of the wisdom of an attitude of determined reserve that he had even given orders against any manifestations of friendship towards Germany such as mutual visits for athletic contests and such like: it was better for the time being to renounce the natural instinct to act &quot;en gentleman&quot;&quot;. On 2 August 1939, Bonnet told Philps that his main enemies in the cabinet were Daladier, the Finance minister Paul Reynaud, the Navy minister César Campinchi, the Interior minister Albert Sarraut, and the Colonial Minister Georges Mandel. Bonnet further stated that his enemies within the Quai d&#x27;Orsay were St. Léger (whom Bonnet accused of being very disloyal to him) along with Robert Coulondre, the ambassador in Berlin and Charles Corbin, the ambassador in London as he noted that both Coulondre and Corbin were friends of St. Léger.

On 3 August 1939, St. Léger learned from French intelligence sources about the British negotiating tactics for the mission to Moscow, which as defined by Lord Halifax stated: &quot;The British delegation is to conduct negotiations very slowly, keeping abreast of the political discussions&quot;. By contrast, the French favored the negotiations for the &quot;peace front&quot; to be completed as soon as possible. The two differing tempo of negotiations favored by the British and French reflected their views on the ultimate desirability of reaching an understanding with the &quot;Reich&quot; or not. For Chamberlain and Lord Halifax, the mere act of engaging in negotiations with the Soviet Union was felt to be sufficient to deter Germany from invading Poland, and to actually create the &quot;peace front&quot; was felt to be counterproductive as it would make it more difficult to reach a &quot;general settlement&quot; with Germany. For the French, the &quot;peace front&quot; was felt to be the only way of deterring Germany from invading Poland, and both Daladier and St. Léger, though not Bonnet, had little hope of the same sort of understanding with Germany that the British favored. The French delegation to Moscow headed by General Joseph Doumenc first went to London to join the British delegation led by Admiral Reginald Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax to travel together in a sign of solidarity. The two delegations boarded a slow-moving ship, the &quot;City of Exeter&quot;, that moved at only 13 knots per hour to take them to Leningrad (modern St. Petersburg) and hence to Moscow. In common with other French officials, St. Léger was very much enraged at Colonel Beck who was completely against allowing the Red Army to enter Poland if Germany should invade while the Soviets insisted on such transit rights as the precondition for the &quot;peace front&quot;. In Moscow, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov, the Soviet defense commissar, had told General Doumenc that his government regarded the issue of transit rights as of paramount importance as he insisted that if the French could not pressure the Poles into granting transit rights for the Red Army, then as far as he was concerned France was not serious about the &quot;peace front&quot;.

On 22 August 1939, St. Léger advised the French cabinet that France should issue a threatening &quot;démarche&quot; in Warsaw to force Beck to allow the Red Army transit rights as he argued that the issue was on the verge of causing the proposed &quot;peace front&quot; to collapse. The Ribbentrop-Molotov non-aggression pact of 23 August 1939 stunned French decision-makers and is known in France as &quot;the diplomatic Waterloo of French history&quot; as the French never saw it coming. The executive decision-makers in Paris had always expected the &quot;peace front&quot; to be created in one form or another, and the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact came as a shocking and most unpleasant surprise in Paris. In desperation, Daladier ordered General Joseph Doumenc to tell the lie that Beck had finally granted the transit rights. Because such hopes had been invested in the &quot;peace front&quot; in France, the debate over who was responsible for its failure was especially bitter. Reynaud accused St. Léger of being the man responsible for the failure to create the &quot;peace front&quot; as he accused St. Léger of moving too slowly and of not doing enough to pressure Colonel Beck to grant transit rights to the Red Army. On 25 August 1939, Daladier told Łukasiewicz that he was not to talk to Bonnet under any conditions, saying the views of the Foreign Minister regarding the Danzig crisis were not his own, and told the Polish ambassador to only talk to himself or St. Léger. At a cabinet meeting of 31 August 1939, Daladier was described as having &quot;bristled like a hedgehog&quot; at the cabinet meeting as he exploded in rage at Bonnet as he warned the planned conference was a &quot;trap&quot; and he accused Bonnet of sullying France&#x27;s honor with his opposition to declaring war. At a crucial moment, Daladier read out a letter from Coulondre that St. Léger had kept secret from Bonnet that won over the majority of the French cabinet to Daladier&#x27;s position.

After Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, Mussolini proposed a peace conference to stop the war. Bonnet, who wanted to avoid declaring war on Germany, saw Mussolini&#x27;s proposal as a way to avoid war. In an effort to sabotage Bonnet&#x27;s plans, St. Léger had Corbin tell Lord Halifax later on the afternoon of 1 September that the British and French governments should place a time limit on Mussolini&#x27;s proposed conference, saying that otherwise the Germans would stall and the war would continue. This message to Corbin was the precise opposite of what Bonnet had wanted Corbin to tell Lord Halifax. Faced with a choice between obeying the foreign minister and the secretary-general, Corbin chose the latter. At a crucial meeting of the French cabinet, Bonnet argued that France should not declare war on Germany and instead embrace Mussolini&#x27;s conference. Before the meeting, St. Léger had briefed Daladier and warned him that the conference was merely a trick to prevent France and Britain from declaring war as Germany would continue the war against Poland while the preparations for the conference continued, quite possibly for months. In a memo to Daladier, St. Léger wrote that it was unacceptable to be holding a peace conference while the &quot;Reich&quot; was waging war on Poland as he concluded: &quot;If such negotiations were to be started by a retreat on the part of the Allies and under the threat of German force, the democracies would soon find themselves faced with wholly unacceptable Axis terms. There would be war anyway and under especially unfavorable conditions. No, the trap is too obvious&quot;. In an unusual move, Bonnet denounced St. Léger in a press conference for having sabotaged his policy as he contended that Mussolini&#x27;s peace conference would have ended the war.

When the declaration of war was finally drafted by Bonnet, it evaded the expression &quot;la guerre&quot; and instead spoke in convoluted terms that France &quot;would fulfil those obligations contracted towards Poland, which the German government is aware of&quot;. Even then, Bonnet in an attempt to avoid war ordered Coulondre to set the expiry of the ultimatum for 5: 00 am on 4 September 1939. Coulondre phoned St. Léger in Paris to ask what he should if Ribbentrop should try to stall him, which led St. Léger to order him to treat any stalling as a negative reply. At that point, Bonnet took the phone from St. Léger to tell Coulondre that the expiry of the ultimatum was to be moved up to 5 pm on 3 September 1939.

=== Dismissal ===
On 13 September 1939, Daladier finally fired Bonnet as Foreign Minister as he stated that Bonnet&#x27;s foreign policy was not his foreign policy. As Daladier was also the premier, he did not have much time for diplomacy and St. Léger was the &quot;de facto&quot; French foreign minister until May 1940. Daladier usually met daily with St. Léger and Coulondre, who was regarded as the German expert within the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, and tended to follow their advice. In February 1940, Sumner Welles, the undersecretary of state, visited the major European capitals on a peace mission for President Roosevelt. During Welles&#x27;s visit to Paris, St. Léger told him: &quot;The game is lost. France is alone against three dictators. Great Britain is not ready and the United States has not even amended the neutrality act. Once again, the democracies have arrived too late&quot;. It is unlikely that this statement represented St. Léger&#x27;s real feelings and was more likely a gambit to try to force the Roosevelt administration to provide more aid to France. Welles wrote he was struck by &quot;magnificent clarity and logic&quot; shown by St. Léger just as he had &quot;as always shown&quot; and by the &quot;innately liberal nature of his political philosophy&quot;. Relations between France and Britain were often strained during the winter of 1939–1940 and in March 1940 Daladier told St. Léger &quot;that what had really taken the stuffing out of him was his loss of faith in his ability ever to induce the British government to take prompt action or a firm line&quot;.

St. Léger was close to Daladier, and after the fall of the Daladier government in March 1940, he was out of favor with the new premier Paul Reynaud. Reynaud&#x27;s mistress, the Comtesse Hélène de Portes had a particular dislike of St. Léger and lobbied her lover very strongly to dismiss him as the secretary-general of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay. On 16 May 1940, the Wehrmacht won the Second Battle of Sedan and broke through the French lines along the Meuse river, throwing Paris into a state of panic as it was believed that the capital would fall within hours. St. Léger oversaw the burning of the records of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay which were thrown into a giant bonfire in the garden of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Reynaud reshuffled his cabinet on 18 May 1940 and appointed Daladier as the new foreign minister. Portes lobbied Reynaud to dismiss St. Léger before Daladier arrived at the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, saying that the &quot;Léger scalp&quot; was worth 70 votes in the &quot;chambre des députés&quot;. On the morning of 19 May 1940 St. Léger learned from reading the morning newspaper that he had just been fired as secretary-general. Georges Mandel, the minister of colonies, was opposed to St. Léger&#x27;s sacking, telling Reynaud that firing a senior diplomat well known for his anti-Nazi views, was sending the wrong message. In mid-July 1940, Leger began a long exile in Washington, DC.

== Exile ==
In 1940, the Vichy government dismissed him from the Légion d&#x27;honneur order and revoked his French citizenship (it was reinstated after the war). Likewise, all of St. Léger&#x27;s assets were confiscated. St. Léger&#x27;s apartment on the Avenue de Camoëns in Paris was looted by the Wehrmacht who burned several of his unpublished poems, much to his distress when he learned that his poems were now lost forever. Found inside of St. Léger&#x27;s apartment was a copy of the Treaty of Versailles on which the German soldiers mocking wrote: &quot;Much good may it do you now, last defender of the last French victory!&quot; St. Léger was opposed to Vichy, but did not support the movement led by General Charles de Gaulle. He was in some financial difficulty as an exile in Washington until Archibald MacLeish, the director of the Library of Congress and himself a poet, raised enough private donations to enable the library to employ him until his official retirement from the French civil service in 1947. He declined a teaching position at Harvard University.

During his American exile, he wrote his long poems &quot;Exil&quot;, &quot;Vents&quot;, &quot;Pluies&quot;, &quot;Neiges&quot;, &quot;Amers&quot;, and &quot;Chroniques&quot;. In March 1942, his long lyrical poem &quot;Exil&quot; (&quot;Exile&quot;) was published in Chicago in the magazine &quot;Poetry&quot;. &quot;Exil&quot; was in many ways his most personal poem as St. Léger recounted his deep longing for France amid his concerns that he would never see France again. In a long letter to MacLeish written later in 1942, St. Léger declared &quot;La France est moi-měme et tout moi-měme&quot; (&quot;France is myself and everything for me&quot;). In the same letter, he wrote about his love of the French language, which for him was a refuge from a world gone mad. St. Léger stated that for him: &quot;...&quot;la langue française le seul refuge imaginable, le seul lieu où je puisse me tenir pour y rien comprendre&quot;&quot; (&quot;the French language is the only refuge imaginable, the only place where I am able to understand anything&quot;). During the war, he served as an unofficial adviser on French affairs to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the war, St. Léger found himself caught between the feud between Roosevelt&#x27;s two closest advisers on foreign affairs, the Undersecretary of State, Sumner Welles, and his archenemy, William Christian Bullitt Jr., the former ambassador to the Soviet Union and France (Roosevelt had little respect for the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull). Bullitt tried very hard to have Welles fired for being gay after he discovered that Welles had propositioned two Afro-American railroad porters in 1940. Despite the feud, St. Léger tried his best to stay on good terms with Welles and Bullitt.

He remained in the US long after the end of the war. In France, St. Léger became known as &quot;le grand absent&quot;. In an attempt to encourage St. Léger to return to France, in 1950 the prestigious &quot;Cahiers de la Pléiade&quot; devoted an entire issue to St. Léger with articles by André Gide, Paul Claudel, Stephen Spender, Archibald MacLeish, Allen Tate, René Char, Renato Poggioli, André Breton, Jorge Guillén, and Giuseppe Ungaretti that all discussed his influence upon their work. He travelled extensively, observing nature and enjoying the friendship of US Attorney General Francis Biddle and his spouse, philanthropist Beatrice Chanler, and author Katherine Garrison Chapin. During his American exile, he increasing turned nature as the themes of his poems. In his 1943 poem &quot;Pluies&quot; the subject was rain; in his 1944 poem &quot;Neiges&quot; the subject was snow; in his 1946 poem &quot;Vents&quot; the subject was the wind; in his 1957 poem &quot;Amers&quot; the subject was the sea; and in his 1959 &quot;Chronquie&quot; the subject was the earth. St. Léger was called by the Swedish poet Erik Lindegren &quot;the Linneaus of modern poetry&quot; owing to his fondness of classifying elements of nature in his poems.

He was on good terms with the UN Secretary General and author Dag Hammarskjöld. Hammarskjöld had majored in French literature as a student at the University of Uppsala and always followed very closely developments in French literature despite his duties at the United Nations. In 1955, Hammarskjöld visited Beijing to meet the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to negotiate the freedom of 15 American pilots shot down during the Korean War who were still being held as prisoners&#x27; by the Chinese in violation of the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953 which called for the immediate release of all POWs. Hammarskjöld stated that his visit to Beijing constantly made him think of &quot;Anabase&quot;, a poem that he greatly admired (Hammarskjöld was fluent in French), which led him to inquire if were possible to meet St. Léger. After his return from Beijing, Hammarskjöld wrote: &quot;Subconsciously, my reaction to the Peking landscape was certainly favored by the &quot;Anabase&quot;. On the other hand, after reading &quot;Anabase&quot; after having seen northern China, it is a new poem-an overwhelming one also in its extraordinary synthesis of the very soul of that part of the world&quot;. To improve his chances of winning the Nobel prize, Lindegren translated the &quot;Anabase&quot; into Swedish for the benefit of the members of the Royal Swedish Academy. The Swedish composer Karl-Birger Blomdahl in a letter to St. Léger wrote that he had just read the &quot;Anabase&quot; in its Swedish translation and asked for permission to set this &quot;magnificent work&quot; to music, but with the lyrics all in French. St. Léger who believed that his poems were incapable of translated because their &quot;internal metrics&quot; could be only rendered in French granted his permission to Blomdahl. However, in his letter granting permission to Blomdahl, St. Léger wrote that the &quot;Anabase&quot; was set in China, but not about China as he wrote that the &quot;Anabase&quot; should &quot;always be thought of as outside the boundaries of space and time, as ruled by the absolute&quot;.

St. Léger first met Hammarskjöld in New York on 30 November 1955, where he gave him a copy of his poetry entitled &quot;To Dag Hammarskjöld, the Magician&quot; (a reference to Hammarskjöld&#x27;s success in persuading the Chinese to release the 15 American airman). On 19 December 1955, Hammarskjöld wrote in a letter to a friend: &quot;A couple of times recently I had the pleasure of meeting Léger. I was very happy to get to know him. What a remarkable man!&quot; Hammarskjöld used his influence in Sweden to join the campaign to have the Royal Swedish Academy award St. Léger the Nobel Prize in literature. On 23 December 1955, Hammarskjöld wrote to Andreas Österling, the secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy: &quot;I recently had the chance to meet Alexis Leger and have seen him since then a couple of times. He is an extraordinary man, simple and warm, of great knowledge and vast experience, with such a talant of a storyteller as I have never seen before&quot;.

The British diplomat Brian Urquhart who knew both St. Léger and Hammarskjöld wrote in 2001: &quot;Dag Hammarskjöld was one of that rare and fascinating breed, an intellectual and aesthete who is also a man of action. As Secretary-General, Hammarskjöld sometimes seemed intimidatingly self-sufficient and omniscient. Since he was an almost obsessively private person, it only became generally known only after his death he had relied upon a few carefully selected friends both for advice and support in his public responsibilities and for regular exchanges on the intellectual and aesthetic matters that were his main recreation and pleasure&quot;. St. Léger as an experienced diplomat and poet was one of Hammarskjöld&#x27;s closest friends. Hammarskjöld as the United Nations Secretary-General had difficult relations with Nikita Khrushchev and Charles de Gaulle. The Francophile Hammarskjöld was especially pained by the criticism coming from de Gaulle, and he turned to St. Léger for support as Urquhart noted that he saw St. Léger as &quot;...the embodiment of the France he so deeply admired&quot;. Hammarskjöld felt that de Gaulle was insufficiently understanding of the newly independent nations of Africa and Asia, and often wrote to St. Léger for his moral support.

== Return to France ==
In 1957, American friends gave him a villa at Giens, Provence, France. He then split his time between France and the United States. In 1958, he married the American Dorothy Milburn Russell. In 1960, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. In 1961, the American poet Wallace Fowlie praised St. Léger for his ability to capture in his poems &quot;the inexplicable emotion, the personal trait, the fleeting intuition&quot;. After receiving the Nobel Prize, he wrote the long poems &quot;Chronique&quot;, &quot;Oiseaux&quot; and &quot;Chant pour un équinoxe&quot; and the shorter &quot;Nocturne&quot; and &quot;Sécheresse&quot;. In 1962, Georges Braque worked with master printmaker Aldo Crommelynck to create a series of etchings and aquatints, &quot;L&#x27;Ordre des Oiseaux&quot;, which was published with the text of Perse&#x27;s &quot;Oiseaux&quot; by Au Vent d&#x27;Arles.

A few months before he died, Leger donated his library, manuscripts and private papers to Fondation Saint-John Perse, a research centre devoted to his life and work (Cité du Livre, Aix-en-Provence), which remains active to the present day. He died in his villa in Giens and is buried nearby.

<doc id="335261" wikidata="Q486195" url="?curid=335261" title="Khiva">
<text>Khiva (, ; other names) is a district-level city of approximately 93,000 people in Khorazm Region, Uzbekistan. According to archaeological data, the city was established around 2,500 years ago.
In 1997, Khiva celebrated its 2500th anniversary. It is the former capital of Khwarezmia, the Khanate of Khiva, and the Khorezm People&#x27;s Soviet Republic. Itchan Kala in Khiva was the first site in Uzbekistan to be inscribed on the World Heritage List (1991). The astronomer, historian and polymath, Al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) was born in either Khiva or the nearby city of Kath.

== Etymology ==

The origin of the name Khiva is unknown, but many contradictory stories have been told to explain it.

A traditional story attributes the name to one of the sons of the prophet Noah: &quot;It is said that Shem, after the flood, he found himself wandering in the desert alone. Having fallen asleep, he dreamt of 300 burning torches. On waking up, he was pleased with this omen, he founded the city with outlines in the form of a ship mapped out according to the placement of the torches, about which he had dreamt. Then Shem dug the Kheyvak well, the water from which had a surprising taste. It is possible to see this well in Ichan-Kala (an internal town of Khiva City) even today.&quot;

Another proposal is that the name comes from the word Khwarezm, altered by borrowing into Turkic as Khivarezem, then shortened to Khiva.

The town is also known as , ; alternative or historical names include &quot;Orgunje&quot;, &quot;Kheeva&quot;, &quot;Khorasam&quot;, &quot;Khoresm&quot;, &quot;Khwarezm&quot;, &quot;Khwarizm&quot;, &quot;Khwarazm&quot;, &quot;Chorezm&quot;, and .

== History ==

In the early part of its history, the Aryan inhabitants spoke an Eastern Iranian language called Khwarezmian. Turks replaced the Iranian ruling class in the 10th century AD, and the region gradually turned into an area with a majority of Turkic speakers.

Russia annexed some parts of the Khanate of Khiva in the 19th century, vassalising it into the Russian protectorate. The last khan from the ruling dynasty was liquidated a century later, in 1919. Thus Khiva became the capital city of the new Khorezm People&#x27;s Soviet Republic. The Khorezm oasis was converted into a part of modern Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan in 1924.

The earliest records of the city of Khiva appear in Muslim travel accounts from the 10th century although archaeological evidence indicates habitation in the 6th century; by the early 17th century, Khiva had become the capital of the Khanate of Khiva. The khanate was ruled by a branch of the Astrakhans, a Genghisid dynasty.

In the 17th century, Khiva began to develop as a slave market. For several centuries, the cities of Bukhara and Khiva were known as major centers of the slave trade, and the Bukhara slave trade, alongside the neighboring slave trade in Khiva, has been referred to as the &quot;slave capitals of the world&quot;. During the first half of the 19th century, around 30,000 Persians and an unknown number of Russians, were enslaved there before being sold. A large part of them were involved in the construction of buildings in the walled Itchan Kala.

===Campaigns===

In the course of the Russian conquest of Central Asia, in 1873 the Russian General Konstantin von Kaufman launched an attack on the city of Khiva, which fell on 28 May 1873. Although the Russian Empire controlled the Khanate, it allowed Khiva to remain as a nominally quasi-independent protectorate.

Following the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia after the October Revolution of 1917, a short-lived (1920-1924) Khorezm People&#x27;s Soviet Republic formed out of the territory of the old Khanate of Khiva before its incorporation into the USSR in 1924. The city of Khiva became part of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic.

==Sights==
Khiva is split into two parts. The outer town, called Dichan Kala, was formerly protected by a wall with 11 gates. The inner town, or Itchan Kala, is encircled by brick walls, whose foundations are believed to have been laid in the 10th century. Present-day crenellated walls date back to the late 17th century and attain the height of 10 meters.

Kalta Minor, the large blue tower in the central city square, was supposed to be a minaret. It was built in 1851 by Mohammed Amin Khan, but the Khan died and the succeeding Khan did not complete it.

The old town retains more than 50 historic monuments and 250 old houses, mostly dating from the 18th or 19th centuries. Djuma Mosque, for instance, was established in the 10th century and rebuilt in 1788–89, although its celebrated hypostyle hall still retains 112 columns taken from ancient structures.

Khiva was home to a number of madrassahs (educational establishments), one of which, Sherghazi Khan madrassah, still stands today. It was built in the 18th century by slaves and is one of the oldest buildings in Ichan-Kala, which is the center of present-day Khiva. Among the renowned students of the madrassah were the Uzbek poet Raunaq, the Qaraqalpaq poet Kasybayuly, the Turkmen poet and sufi Magtymguly.

==Industry and production==
In the town, activities such as the &quot;KhivaCarpet&quot; joint-stock company, cotton cleaning, ginning factories, carpet weaving, the &quot;Khiva Gilami&quot; joint-stock company, and other carpet weaving enterprises, as well as a bread factory, a farmer&#x27;s market, cultural, trade, and service establishments are operational. There are branches of Urgench University specializing in agro-management, the Uzbek Academy of Sciences Khorezm Mamun Academy, the Qoraqum Scientific Research Station, pedagogical, medical, and tourism colleges, vocational lyceums, a gymnasium, 15 general education schools, a house of culture, 2 special boarding schools, a regional puppet theater, an art school, 2 libraries and their branches, and cultural and recreational gardens.

The central hospital, polyclinic, maternity hospital, children&#x27;s hospital, dental treatment center, central pharmacy, specialized clinics, and other medical facilities are available in the district. Historical and architectural sites in the area include :&lt;br&gt; the Sayd Alauddin mausoleum, the Pahlavon Mahmud Complex, the Juma Mosque, the Old Ark, Oqshayx Bobo&#x27;s Palace, Toshhovli Palace, Nurullabai Palace, Muhammad Aminxon Madrasah, Muhammad Rahimxon Madrasah, Islamkhodja Madrasah and Minaret, Olloqulixon Madrasah, Qutlughmurad Inoq Madrasah, Olloqulixon Caravanserai and its market, Anushakhan Bathhouse, Oq Mosque, Polvon Gate, Ota Gate, Bogcha Gate, Tosh Gate, Hazorasp Gate, Kush Gate, and more.

The town publishes the &quot;Khiva-Sharq Gavhari&quot; magazine (since 2001) and the &quot;Khiva Tongi&quot; district newspaper. The town is a prominent center for global tourism, attracting over 200,000 tourists every year, including nearly 7,000 international visitors. &quot;O&#x27;zbekTurizm&quot; national company operates in the town, and several private guesthouses are in operation.

A trolleybus line was established from Khiva to Urgench in 1997. Bus and minibus routes connect Khiva to Tashkent, Bukhara, Navoi, Samarkand, Urgench, Qo&#x27;shko&#x27;pir, Yangiariq, Bog&#x27;ot, Hazorasp, and other major cities and population centers in the region.

== Archaeological and cultural significance ==
Khwarazm occupies a special place in the list of values of universal importance as a major center of world civilization and one of the important centers on the Silk Road.

The unique values of world significance include architectural monuments of Khiva, which has rightfully earned the title of &quot;museum city&quot;.

The image of modern Khiva is mainly formed by the architecture of the period of Khiva Khanate of the late XVIII - early XX centuries.

But archaeological excavations underway here show that at the base of a number of relatively &quot;young&quot; remains of buildings are ancient layers dating back to the III and even earlier centuries BC.

== Overview of architectural monuments of Khiva ==
Most of Khiva&#x27;s architectural masterpieces are concentrated in its urban core - Itchan Kala. It is a &quot;city within a city&quot; surrounded by powerful fortress walls with four gates on each side of the world.

One of the main highways runs from the western gate to the eastern gate, along which the main monumental buildings are concentrated.

From the observation tower of Ak-Sheikh-bobo Itchan-Kala can be seen like in the palm of your hand. The unusual silhouette of the Kalta Minor minaret attracts attention, as if cut down to the middle.

Its massive trunk, exquisitely decorated with wide and narrow belts of glazed brick, indicates that it was conceived as a grandiose, majestic structure, the main vertical of the city.

But after the death of the khan, under whom the minaret was built, it remained unfinished, receiving the name of Kalta (short).

Very close to the Kalta Minar is the Muhammad Aminxon Madrasah, the largest of the preserved buildings of higher theological educational institutions.

The peculiarity of its architecture is the twin hudjras - cells for living of students. Belts of colored brick sets and majolica facings decorate the building wonderfully.

On the territory of Konya Ark (Old Fortress) there is the palace of Muhammad Rahimxon I with rich and unusual interior decoration.

The walls of the hall are decorated with ganch carving with coloring. The neighboring two-storied building is a harem. There are many rich chambers, living rooms.

The Juma Mosque (X century, 1788) is amazing in its beauty. On the entrance doors the date of construction - 1778-1782 years is preserved.

But 210 columns of the mosque, supporting the roof, are much older - from XII to XV centuries. The columns are remarkable for their amazing slenderness, rich ornamental carving.

They were brought here from other ancient buildings, so many columns are unique and do not resemble each other.

At the gates of Polvon darvoza there is a whole ensemble of buildings. The main palace of Khiva khans Toshhovli occupies a special place here.

The architecture of its numerous apartments and decorative furnishings are unique. There are ornamental wood carvings, majolica facings and figurative cartouches.

The palace of Kurnysh-khan was intended for lavish receptions. Once there was a wooden throne in the throne room decorated with silver chasing on a red background.

The building has a beautiful iwan with columns. The palace is also remarkable for its rich majolica wall lining with intricate ornaments.

The Pahlavon Mahmud Memorial Complex was built in memory of the revered Khiva poet, who after his death was canonized as the patron saint of the city.

Nearby is the 45-meter high Islomxo‘ja minaret topped with a through lantern with a dome on top. In the outer part of the city - Dishan qalʼa - there are also many ancient architectural monuments.

<text>Nelly Sachs (; 10 December 1891 – 12 May 1970) was a German–Swedish poet and playwright. Her experiences resulting from the rise of the Nazis in World War II Europe transformed her into a poignant spokesperson for the grief and yearnings of her fellow Jews. Her best-known play is &#x27; (1950); other works include the poems &quot; (1962), &quot; (1970), and the collections of poetry&#x27; (1947), &#x27; (1959),&#x27; (1961), and &quot;&quot; (1971). She was awarded the 1966 Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Life and career==
Leonie Sachs was born in Berlin-Schöneberg, Germany, in 1891 to a Jewish family. Her parents were the wealthy natural rubber and gutta-percha manufacturers Georg William Sachs (1858–1930) and his wife Margarete, née Karger (1871–1950). She was educated at home because of frail health. She showed early signs of talent as a dancer, but her protective parents did not encourage her to pursue a profession. She grew up as a very sheltered, introverted young woman and never married. She pursued an extensive correspondence with her friends Selma Lagerlöf and Hilde Domin. As the Nazis took power, she became increasingly terrified, at one point losing the ability to speak, as she would remember in verse: &quot;When the great terror came/I fell dumb.&quot; Sachs fled with her aged mother to Sweden in 1940. It was her friendship with Lagerlöf that saved their lives: shortly before her own death, Lagerlöf intervened with the Swedish royal family to secure their release from Germany. Sachs and her mother escaped on the last flight from Nazi Germany to Sweden, a week before Sachs was scheduled to report to a concentration camp. They settled in Sweden, and Sachs became a Swedish citizen in 1952.

Living in a tiny two-room apartment in Stockholm, Sachs cared for her mother alone for many years, and supported their existence by translations between Swedish and German. After her mother&#x27;s death, Sachs suffered several psychotic breakdowns, characterized by hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions of persecution by Nazis, and spent a number of years in a mental institution. She continued to write while hospitalized, and eventually recovered sufficiently to live on her own, though her mental health remained fragile. Her worst breakdown was ostensibly precipitated by hearing spoken German during a trip to Switzerland to accept a literary prize. But she maintained a forgiving attitude toward younger Germans, and corresponded with many German-speaking writers of the postwar period, including Hans Magnus Enzensberger and Ingeborg Bachmann.

== Paul Celan and lyrical poetry==

In the context of the Shoah, her deep friendship with &quot;brother&quot; poet Paul Celan is often noted today. Their bond was described in one of Celan&#x27;s most famous poems, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Zürich, The Stork Inn&quot;). Sachs and Celan shared the Holocaust and the fate of the Jews throughout history, their interest in Jewish and Christian beliefs and practices, and their literary models; their imagery was often remarkably similar, though developed independently. Their friendship was supportive during professional conflicts. Celan also suffered from artistic infighting (Claire Goll&#x27;s accusations of plagiarism) during a period of frustration with his work&#x27;s reception. When Sachs met Celan she was embroiled in a long dispute with Finnish-Jewish composer Moses Pergament over his adaptation of her play &quot;&quot;. In Celan she found someone who understood her anxiety and hardships as an artist.

Sachs&#x27;s poetry is intensely lyrical and reflects some influence by German Romanticism, especially in her early work. The poetry she wrote as a young woman in Berlin is more inspired by Christianity than Judaism and makes use of traditional Romantic imagery and themes. Much of it concerns an unhappy love affair Sachs suffered in her teens with a non-Jewish man who would eventually be killed in a concentration camp. After Sachs learned of her only love interest&#x27;s death, she bound up his fate with that of her people and wrote many love lyrics ending not only in the beloved&#x27;s death, but in the catastrophe of the Holocaust. Sachs herself mourns no longer as a jilted lover but as a personification of the Jewish people in their vexed relationship with history and God. Her fusion of grief with subtly romantic elements is in keeping with the imagery of the kabbalah, where the Shekhinah represents God&#x27;s presence on earth and mourns for the separation of God from His people in their suffering. Thus Sachs&#x27;s Romanticism allowed her to develop self-consciously from a German to a Jewish writer, with a corresponding change in her language: still flowery and conventional in some of her first poetry on the Holocaust, it becomes ever more compressed and surreal, returning to a series of the same images and tropes (dust, stars, breath, stones and jewels, blood, dancers, fish suffering out of water, madness, and ever-frustrated love) in ways that are sometimes comprehensible only to her readers, but always moving and disturbing. Though Sachs does not resemble many authors, she appears to have been influenced by Gertrud Kolmar and Else Lasker-Schüler, in addition to Celan.

In 1961 Sachs won the first Nelly Sachs Prize, a literary award given biennially by the German city of Dortmund and named in her honour. The city commissioned Walter Steffens to compose the opera &quot;Eli&quot; based on her mystery play, which premiered at the new opera house in 1967. When, with Shmuel Yosef Agnon, she was awarded the 1966 Nobel Prize in Literature, she observed that Agnon represented Israel whereas &quot;I represent the tragedy of the Jewish people.&quot; She read her poem &quot;In der Flucht&quot; at the ceremony.

Sachs died from colorectal cancer in 1970. She was interred in the Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm. Her possessions were donated to the National Library of Sweden.
A memorial plaque commemorates her birthplace, Maaßenstraße 12, in Schöneberg, Berlin, where there is also a park named for her in Dennewitzstraße. A park on the island of Kungsholmen in Stockholm also bears her name.

<text>Deinopidae, also known as net casting spiders, is a family of cribellate spiders first described by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1850. It consists of stick-like elongated spiders that catch prey by stretching a web across their front legs before propelling themselves forward. These unusual webs will stretch two or three times their relaxed size, entangling any prey that touch them. The posterior median eyes have excellent night vision, allowing them to cast nets accurately in low-light conditions. These eyes are larger than the others, and sometimes makes these spiders appear to only have two eyes. Ogre-faced spiders (&quot;Deinopis&quot;) are the best known genus in this family. The name refers to the perceived physical similarity to the mythological creature of the same name. This family also includes the humped-back spiders (&quot;Menneus&quot;).

They are distributed through tropics worldwide from Australia to Africa and the Americas. In Florida, &quot;Deinopis&quot; often hangs upside down from a silk line under palmetto fronds during the day. At night, it emerges to practice its unusual prey capture method on invertebrate prey. Its eyes are able to gather available light more efficiently than the eyes of cats and owls, and are able to do this despite the lack of a reflective layer (tapetum lucidum); instead, each night, a large area of light-sensitive membrane is manufactured within the eyes, and since arachnid eyes do not have irises, it is rapidly destroyed again at dawn.

==Genera==

Two genera formerly included in this family, &quot;Avella&quot; and &quot;Avellopsis&quot; , are now placed in &quot;Menneus&quot;. , the World Spider Catalog accepts the following genera:

*&quot;Asianopis&quot; – Africa, Asia, Oceania
*&quot;Deinopis&quot; – Every continent, except Europe and Antarctica
*&quot;Menneus&quot; – Africa, Oceania

<doc id="335268" wikidata="Q1676611" url="?curid=335268" title="JJY">
<text>JJY is the call sign of a low frequency time signal radio station located in Japan.

The station broadcasts from two sites, one on Mount Otakadoya, near Fukushima, and the other on Mount Hagane, located on Kyushu island. JJY is operated by the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), an independent administrative institution affiliated with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of the Japanese government.

== Transmission sites ==
The Mount Otakadoya site () is located at an elevation of 790 meters (2,590 ft) in Tamura City, Fukushima Prefecture. It broadcasts a 50 kW signal (13 kW ERP) on 40 kHz from an umbrella top-loading antenna situated 250 meters (820 ft) above the ground. In March 2011, it was powered down and evacuated due to its proximity to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. It resumed broadcasting on April 21, unattended by staff. It went off air again temporarily on April 25 due to lightning, but has ever since been on air.

The Mount Hagane site () is located at an elevation of 900 meters (2,950 ft) in Saga City, Saga Prefecture. It broadcasts a 50 kW signal (23 kW ERP) on 60 kHz to avoid interfering with the Otakadoya site as their signals overlap. The antenna for the Hagane site is also an umbrella top loading antenna and is situated 200 meters (650 ft) above the ground. This site does not have a redundant 40 kHz transmitter, so cannot act as a fallback for the Mount Otakadoya site.

== Time standards ==
Both carrier signals contain an identical pulse-width modulated time code and are transmitted 24 hours a day. Low frequency (LF) transmissions are used to enhance accuracy and reduce the possibility of atmospheric interference. The calculated accuracy of JJY&#x27;s signal is 1×10−11.

Japan Standard Time is set by a caesium atomic clock in Tokyo. This information is sent to the transmitter stations and is used to set a caesium atomic clock at each station. These clocks are housed in an environmentally controlled and electromagnetically shielded room to prevent outside interference with the clocks.

The time code format is very similar to that of WWVB in the United States but technically is a variant of IRIG. Similarly to WWVB or MSF the signal of JJY is used to synchronize consumer radio-controlled clocks sold throughout Japan.

== Transmission systems ==
Each station has an identical setup of equipment. A dual set of transmitters, a primary and a backup, provide for constant transmission of the time code. However, it is not possible given the current design configuration for one site to act as a &quot;lower power alternate frequency&quot; backup for the other. The backups are set to automatically take over in the event that the primary transmission system has a failure. The Time Signal Control Room generates the standard LF signal and time code that is broadcast.

The Impedance Matching Room has a matching transformer to perform impedance matching between the transmitter and the antenna. Due to the high power of radio frequency signals that pass through the room, it is completely shielded in copper and is off-limits during broadcasts.

==History and former shortwave station==
On January 30, 1940, the Communications Research Laboratory (the predecessor of NICT), began operations of JJY as a shortwave station, broadcasting at 4, 7, 9, and 13 MHz. Over the years, these were dropped and by the late 1950s, JJY was transmitting its time signal on standard frequencies of 2.5, 5, 8, 10, and 15 MHz. The 2.5 and 15 MHz broadcasts terminated in 1996. The time signals included announcements of the time, in both Morse code and by a female voice, before every tenth minute: for example, &quot;JJY JJY 1630 JST&quot; (the voice announcement of the time being in Japanese).

Experimental station JG2AS began broadcasting on January 10, 1966, providing digitally encoded time signals in the longwave band at 40 kHz. In 1997, the CRL, determining that the longwave time signal was more accurate when received, subject to less interference, and in wider use than the shortwave time signal, decided to construct a new longwave time station and gradually eliminate the shortwave broadcasts. The first official longwave station of JJY began broadcasting from Mount Otakadoya at 40 kHz on June 10, 1999, and the shortwave broadcasts finally ceased operation on March 31, 2001. On October 1, 2001, the 60 kHz longwave transmission from Mount Hagane began.

The Mount Otakadoya transmitter survived the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, but is 17 km from the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, and was powered down when it was evacuated on March 12 (19:46 JST) due to the 20 km radius evacuation order. It was re-enabled April 21.

==JJY Time Code==
As with most longwave time code stations, the JJY signal is amplitude-modulated to send one bit per second, transmitting a complete time code every minute.

The time code is most similar to that transmitted by WWVB, but each bit is reversed: on the second, the carrier is increased to full power. Some time during the second (depending on the bit to be transmitted), the carrier is reduced by 10 dB, to 10% power, until the beginning of the next second.

There are three different signals that are sent each second:
* 0 bits consist of 0.8 s of full power, followed by 0.2 s of reduced power.
* 1 bits consist of 0.5 s of full power, followed by 0.5 s of reduced power.
* Marker bits consist of 0.2 s of full power, followed by 0.8 s of reduced power.

As with WWVB, seconds 0, 9, 19, 29, 39, 49 and 59 of each minute are marker bits. The remaining 53 encode Japan Standard Time using binary-coded decimal. JST does not include summer time, but bits are reserved to handle it. Leap second warning bits are also provided, these announce leap seconds starting at the beginning of the UTC month (09:00 JST on the first day of the month), and ending with the leap second insertion (just after 08:59 JST on the first day of the following month).

The full-time code is as follows:

The first 35 seconds are identical to WWVB, but after that it diverges, including some parity and day-of-week bits not in WWVB, and omitting DUT1 information.
P0 is always the last second of a minute. In the event of a leap second, an additional 0 bit is inserted before it, and the marker bit is transmitted during second 60. LS1 and LS2 are normally both 0. Both bits are set to announce an inserted leap second at the end of the current UTC month.

Twice per hour (minutes 15 and 45), the last 20 seconds of the time code are different. In lieu of the year bits, the station&#x27;s call sign is broadcast in Morse code twice using on-off keying during seconds 40 through 48. Further, bits 50 through 55 are replaced by 6 status bits ST1 through ST6 which, if non-zero, indicate a scheduled service interruption:
ST1 through ST3 indicate the time of the planned service interruption:
ST4, if set, promises the service interruption will be during daylight hours only. If unset, the interruption may be all day.

ST5 and ST6 indicate the duration of the interruption:
If no interruption is planned, all ST bits are 0.

<text>The Music City Bowl is a post-season American college football bowl game certified by the NCAA that has been played in Nashville, Tennessee, since 1998. Since 2020, it has been sponsored by TransPerfect and is officially known as the TransPerfect Music City Bowl. Previous title sponsors include American General Life &amp; Accident (1998), HomePoint.com (1999), Gaylord Entertainment (2002–2003), both Gaylord Entertainment and Bridgestone (2004–2009), and Franklin American Mortgage Company (2010–2019). From 2014 through 2019, the bowl had tie-ins with the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), Big Ten Conference, and Southeastern Conference (SEC); for 2020 through 2025, the bowl has tie-ins with the Big Ten and SEC.

The 2020 edition, slated for December 30 between Missouri and Iowa, was cancelled on December 27 due to COVID-19 issues within Missouri&#x27;s program.

==History==

The first Music City Bowl was played at Vanderbilt Stadium in 1998. Beginning in 1999, the game was moved to the recently-completed Adelphia Coliseum (now known as Nissan Stadium) in Nashville, Tennessee, the home stadium of the newly-renamed Tennessee Titans. American General Life &amp; Accident (now a subsidiary of AIG) sponsored the inaugural 1998 game, and the now-defunct &quot;homepoint.com&quot; sponsored the 1999 game. There was no sponsor in 2000 or 2001. In 2002, with title sponsorship from Nashville-based Gaylord Hotels, the game became known as the Gaylord Hotels Music City Bowl. In 2003, Bridgestone became the presenting sponsor of the game, and its full title became the Gaylord Hotels Music City Bowl presented by Bridgestone. Bridgestone dropped its presenting sponsorship following the 2007 game. Beginning with the 2010 game, Franklin American Mortgage served as title sponsor, with Gaylord continuing as a major sponsor of the event. In December 2019, it was announced that TransPerfect, a New York City-based translation services company, would take over title sponsorship of the bowl for the 2020 through 2025 playings.

===Conference tie-ins===
The game initially featured a matchup between representatives of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and the Big East Conference. The Big East was replaced by the Big Ten Conference in 2002. Beginning with the 2006 game, the Big Ten was replaced by the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The ACC also took part in the 2005 game, when Virginia appeared because the SEC did not have enough bowl-eligible teams. For six seasons beginning in 2014, the Music City Bowl shared its tie in with the Gator Bowl (also known as the TaxSlayer Bowl for several playings), to match an SEC team with either an ACC or Big Ten team. In June 2019, the Music City Bowl announced an extension to their agreement with the SEC, and an agreement for the Big Ten to provide teams for the 2020 through 2025 seasons.

==Game results==

The Music City Bowl has a history of upsets. The biggest underdog win was when Kentucky (+10) defeated Clemson 28–20 in 2006. Other big upsets include Minnesota (+7) defeating Arkansas 29–14 in 2002, and Virginia (+6) defeating Minnesota 34–31 in 2005. Boston College was a four-point underdog when they defeated Georgia 20–16 in 2001, West Virginia was a three-point underdog when they beat Ole Miss in 2000, Syracuse was a three-point underdog when they defeated Kentucky in 1999, and Minnesota was a one-point underdog when they beat Alabama in 2004. In 2008, four-point underdog Vanderbilt, making their first bowl appearance since 1982, upset Boston College, 24th in the BCS rankings, 16–14.

All rankings are taken from the AP Poll prior to the game being played.

<doc id="335276" wikidata="Q2996553" url="?curid=335276" title="Coombs, British Columbia">
<text>Coombs is a small community on Vancouver Island in the Regional District of Nanaimo, British Columbia, situated on provincial highway 4A approximately west of Parksville. According to the 2021 census, Coombs is home to 1672 people.

Coombs is known for its Old Country Market (also known as Goats on the Roof, which features a family of goats living on the roof), Butterfly World (which includes a small indoor tropical rainforest), the 106 year old Coombs Fall Fair, and the Coombs Bluegrass Festival held at the Coombs Rodeo Grounds every B.C. Day weekend.

== History ==
The area was hostorically inhabited by the Coast Salish peoples, including the Snuneymuxw First Nation, who have lived in the region for more than 5,000 years.

=== Etymology ===
Coombs was established as a settlement in the late 19th century. The settlement of Coombs began to grown during the early years of European colonization. The area was named after Commissioner Thomas Bales Coombs, head of the Salvation Army movement in Canada in the early 1900s. The Salvation Army honoured Coombs&#x27; retirement in 1911 by naming the new colony after him. Commissioner Coombs never visited the area.

=== European Settlers ===
In 1908, Walter Ford built a log house that is still standing today on the Alberni Highway. 

The community was established in 1910 under a Salvation Army emigration plan, in which people were relocated from crowded cities in Great Britain to Canada. Walter Ford, of Ford Logging from Duncan, and his brother-in-law John West, were tasked with preparing Errington for the arrival of the newcomers from England. The newcomers were led by Ensign Crego. Crego was trained in farming skills. 

In 1911, the General Store was built, which also served as the Post Office. This building functioned as a general store until 2021, and is now a store selling Dutch products. 

In 1910, a log cabin that had previously been the residence of Willian Buss was used as the first school house.

In 1912, the French Creek School opened at the request of the Coombs&#x27; Salvation Army Colony. The school was the first government built school in the area. The school closed in 2014.

In 1913, the first annual Fall Fair was held in neighbouring Hilliers. 

In 1921 the Coombs Community Hall opened. 

In 1923 the Fall Fair was moved to Coombs. 

==Climate==
Under the Köppen climate classification, Coombs is located at the northernmost limits of the cool dry-summer subtropical zone (&quot;Csb&quot;) or cool-summer Mediterranean climate, due to its dry summers.

<text>The Sugar Bowl is an annual American college football bowl game played in New Orleans, Louisiana. Played annually since January 1, 1935, it is tied with the Orange Bowl and Sun Bowl as the second-oldest bowl games in the country, surpassed only by the Rose Bowl Game. 

The Sugar Bowl was originally played at Tulane Stadium before moving to the Superdome in 1975. When the Superdome and the rest of the city suffered damage due to both the winds from and the flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Sugar Bowl was temporarily moved to the Georgia Dome in Atlanta in 2006. Since 2007, the game has been sponsored by Allstate and officially known as the Allstate Sugar Bowl. Previous sponsors include Nokia (1996–2006) and USF&amp;G Financial Services (1988–1995).

The Sugar Bowl has had a longstanding relationship with the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Through 91 editions, only 12 games have not featured a representative from the SEC. The SEC&#x27;s opponent varied from year to year, but prior to the advent of the Bowl Coalition, it was often a member of the Big Eight, the SWC, or a major independent. Starting in 2015, the Sugar Bowl also established a relationship with the Big 12 Conference.

Beginning in 1992, the Sugar Bowl joined with several other bowls to create the Bowl Coalition in an effort to produce an undisputed national champion in college football. It would subsequently participate in the Bowl Alliance and Bowl Championship Series. From 1993 to 2006, the Sugar Bowl served as the national championship game of these systems in 1993, 1997, 2000, and 2004. The Superdome and the Sugar Bowl Committee hosted the BCS National Championship Game in 2008 and 2012, in addition to the regular Sugar Bowl game.

In 2014, the Sugar Bowl, along with the &quot;New Year&#x27;s Six&quot; bowls, became a part of the College Football Playoff. As part of the four team playoff from 2015 to 2023, the Sugar Bowl served as a semifinal game in 2015, 2018, and 2021. When not serving as a semifinal, the Sugar Bowl featured the best available teams from SEC and the Big 12 conferences. 

With the expansion of the College Football Playoff to twelve teams in the 2024–25 season, the Sugar Bowl will serve as either a quarterfinal or semifinal each year. It served as a quarterfinal in 2025 and will do so again in 2026. When serving as a quarterfinal, the Sugar Bowl will host the higher-seeded SEC or Big 12 champion, if seeded in the top four. When serving as a semifinal, the game will be played one week after New Year&#x27;s Day, and, if the SEC or Big 12 champion is one of the top two seeds, the higher-seeded team will be assigned to the Sugar Bowl.

==History==
In 1890, Pasadena, California, held its first Tournament of Roses Parade to showcase the city&#x27;s mild weather compared to the harsh winters in northern cities. As one of the organizers said: &quot;In New York, people are buried in snow. Here, our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear [fruit]. Let&#x27;s hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise.&quot; In 1902, the annual festival was enhanced by adding a football game.
In 1926, leaders in Miami, Florida, decided to do the same with a &quot;Fiesta of the American Tropics&quot; that was centered around a New Year&#x27;s Day football game. Although a second &quot;Fiesta&quot; was never held, Miami leaders later revived the idea with the &quot;Palm Festival&quot; (with the slogan &quot;Have a Green Christmas in Miami&quot;). The football game and associated festivities of the Palm Festival were soon named the &quot;Orange Bowl.&quot;

In New Orleans, Louisiana, the idea of a New Year&#x27;s Day football game was first presented in 1927 by Colonel James M. Thomson, publisher of the &quot;New Orleans Item&quot;, and Sports Editor Fred Digby. Every year thereafter, Digby repeated calls for action, and even came up with the name &quot;Sugar Bowl&quot; for his proposed football game.

By 1935, enough support had been garnered for the first Sugar Bowl. The game was played in Tulane Stadium, which had been built in 1926 on Tulane University&#x27;s campus (before 1871, Tulane&#x27;s campus was Paul Foucher&#x27;s plantation, where Foucher&#x27;s father-in-law, Etienne de Bore, had first granulated sugar from cane syrup). Warren V. Miller, the first president of the New Orleans Mid-Winter Sports Association, guided the Sugar Bowl through its difficult formative years of 1934 and 1935. An unusual 2–0 score marked the 1942 Sugar Bowl, in which the sole scoring play was a safety.

In January 1956, Bobby Grier became the first black player to participate in the Sugar Bowl. He is also regarded as the first black player to compete at a bowl game in the Deep South, though others such as Wallace Triplett had played in games like the 1948 Cotton Bowl in Dallas. Grier&#x27;s team, the Pittsburgh Panthers, was set to play against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. However, Georgia&#x27;s governor Marvin Griffin beseeched Georgia Tech to not participate in this racially integrated game. Griffin was widely criticized by news media leading up to the game, and protests were held at his mansion by Georgia Tech students. Despite the governor&#x27;s objections, Georgia Tech&#x27;s president Blake R. Van Leer upheld the contract after he threatened to resign and the board of regents voted in his favor to compete in the bowl. In the game&#x27;s first quarter, a pass interference call against Grier ultimately resulted in Yellow Jackets&#x27; 7-0 victory. Grier stated that he has mostly positive memories about the experience, including the support from teammates and letters from all over the world.

In November 1967, Army&#x27;s success on the field (then at 7–1) made them a strong candidate to be selected for the 1968 game. However, Pentagon officials, in the midst of the Vietnam War, refused to allow the team to play what would have been the academy&#x27;s first bowl game ever—citing the &quot;heavy demands on the players&#x27; time&quot; as well as an emphasis on football being &quot;not consistent with the academy&#x27;s basic mission: to produce career Army officers.&quot;
Tulane Stadium hosted through December 1974, and it has since been at the Superdome (except 2006). For the 1972 season, the game was moved to New Year&#x27;s Eve night; which lasted for four editions, returning to New Year&#x27;s Day in January 1977. The last time it was played on natural grass was in January 1971.

Compared to most bowl games, the Sugar Bowl has had steady naming rights sponsorship. Its first corporate title sponsor was USF&amp;G Financial Services from 1987 to 1995, then Finnish mobile phone manufacturer Nokia from 1995 to 2006. In March 2006, Allstate Insurance was announced as the new title sponsor, and has continued to sponsor the game since.

ABC Sports televised the game from 1969 through 2006. Fox Sports televised the game from 2007 to 2010 as part of its contract with the BCS. ESPN started airing the game with the 2010–11 season, after outbidding Fox for the broadcasting rights.

The 2006 game was relocated to the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia, because of the extensive damage the Superdome suffered as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Big East Champion West Virginia would go on to beat SEC Champion Georgia in the game 38-35. It returned to the refurbished Superdome in 2007. The payout for the 2006 game was $14–17 million per participating team. According to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, the 2007 salary for Sugar Bowl CEO Paul Hoolahan was $607,500.

Prior to the BCS, the game traditionally hosted the Southeastern Conference (SEC) champion against a top-tier at-large opponent. This was formalized in 1975, when the SEC champion was granted an automatic bid to the Sugar Bowl starting with the end of the 1976 season. This continued throughout the time of the Bowl Coalition, a precursor to the BCS. However, the Sugar Bowl agreed to release the SEC champion if necessary to force a national championship game. Under this format, the Sugar Bowl hosted the first Bowl Coalition national championship game, when SEC champion Alabama upended Miami at the end of the 1992 season. When the Bowl Coalition became the Bowl Alliance at the start of the 1995 season, the Sugar Bowl would still release the SEC champion to go to the national championship game if they were ranked in the top two in the nation.

Under the now-defunct BCS format, the Sugar Bowl continued to host the SEC champion against a top-tier at-large opponent, unless the SEC champion went to the BCS National Championship Game. When this happened, the Sugar Bowl usually selected the highest-ranked SEC team still available in the BCS pool. The SEC champion played for the national championship in every one of the eight final editions of the BCS (2006–2013).

The Sugar Bowl maintains an archive of past programs, images, newsreels, and other materials. The archive, originally housed in the Superdome, survived Hurricane Katrina, but a more secure home was needed. During the summer of 2007, the Sugar Bowl donated its materials to The Historic New Orleans Collection, designating it the permanent home of its archive.

Ohio State vacated its 2011 Sugar Bowl victory over Arkansas in response to NCAA allegations over a memorabilia-for-cash scandal.

The 2012 game, pitting the Michigan Wolverines against the Virginia Tech Hokies, was the first Sugar Bowl since 2000—and only the sixth since World War II—without an SEC team. Both of the SEC&#x27;s BCS participants, Alabama and LSU, played in the National Championship Game (in the Superdome), and under BCS rules only two teams per conference were eligible for BCS bowls.

In May 2012, the Big 12 and SEC announced plans to create a new bowl game, the &quot;Champions Bowl,&quot; that would play host to the champions of those two conferences. That November, it was officially announced that the Champions Bowl had been awarded to New Orleans under a 12-year contract beginning in 2015, and would retain the Sugar Bowl name (stating that &quot;Champions Bowl&quot; was only a working title). In addition, it was announced that the Sugar Bowl would host one of two national semi-final games every three seasons (in the 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 seasons) as part of the new College Football Playoff system replacing the BCS.

The game for the 2022 season was moved to December 31, 2022 with a noon ET kickoff; out of respect to the NFL, no bowl games are played on January 1 if it falls on a Sunday, while broadcaster ESPN is also committed to airing &quot;Monday Night Football.&quot; It was only the sixth edition of the game played on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

The Washington Huskies, by virtue of being ranked #2 in the CFP rankings at the end of the 2023 season, became the first Pac-12 team to play in the Sugar Bowl, where they faced #3 Texas in a winning effort, 37–31.

==Most Outstanding Players (Miller-Digby Award)==

The Miller-Digby Award is presented to the Most Outstanding Player (MOP) in the Sugar Bowl, as voted by sports journalists covering the game. The award was initially established in 1948 following the death of Warren V. Miller, the first president of the Bowl; it was renamed the Miller-Digby Memorial Trophy in 1959, to also honor Fred J. Digby, the first general manager and fellow founding member of the Bowl. When the Sugar Bowl acts as a CFP semifinal, both an offensive and defensive MVP are named; this has been the case in 2015, 2018, 2021, and 2023.


 Terrelle Pryor was later ruled ineligible and his statistics for the 2010 season, including the 2011 Sugar Bowl, were vacated.

==Broadcasting==
From 1999 to 2006, the game aired on ABC as part of its BCS package, where it had also been televised from 1969 through 1998. The Sugar Bowl was the only Bowl Alliance game to stick with ABC following the 1995, 1996 and 1997 seasons; the Fiesta and Orange Bowls were televised by CBS. Prior to that, NBC aired the game for several years. From 2006 to 2010, Fox broadcast the game, while ESPN picked up the Sugar Bowl after picking up the rest of the BCS beginning in the 2009–10 season. For 2013, ESPN Deportes introduced a Spanish language telecast of the game.

In November 2012, ESPN announced that it had reached a deal to maintain broadcast rights to the Sugar Bowl through 2026. ESPN pays $55 million yearly to broadcast the game beginning in the 2014–15 season under the new contract, which took effect upon the establishment of the College Football Playoff. ESPN made a similar deal to maintain broadcast rights to the Orange Bowl following the discontinuation of the BCS as well.

<text>Royal Brackla distillery is a Highland single malt Scotch whisky distillery on the Cawdor Estate, near Nairn in Scotland.

==History==
The Brackla distillery was built in 1812 by Captain William Fraser of Brackla House on the estate of Cawdor Castle. In 1833 Brackla Distillery became the first whisky distillery to be granted a royal warrant by King William IV. Royal Brackla is one of three distilleries to bear the name &#x27;Royal&#x27;, the others being the active distillery Royal Lochnagar and the demolished distillery Glenury Royal. Queen Victoria renewed Brackla&#x27;s royal warrant in 1838.

In 1839 William Fraser &amp; Co took over the distillery and it was passed from William Fraser to his son Robert Fraser in 1852. It was in 1878 that Robert Fraser disposed of the distillery to the firm Robert Fraser &amp; Co and in 1879 the company was reconstructed as the Brackla Distillery Co Ltd.

The 1897 prospectus reveals that the capital of the company was £100,000, divided into 40,000 preference and 60,000 ordinary shares. The Directors of the company were James Anderson, Wine Merchant, Leith, Andrew Usher of Northfield, John Usher of Norton and Walter C. Newbigging, distiller at Brackla. The Prospectus also reported:

&quot;Brackla&#x27;s whisky has long been known as one of the best Highland malt whiskies in the market. The demand for it has for years been much in excess of the supply, and in order to cope with this demand considerable additions have recently been made to the distillery.&quot;

The distillery and warehouse, at this time, was on a site of over 13 acres, this was held under lease from the Earl of Cawdor.

In 1919 John Mitchel and James Leith of Aberdeen acquired the company but then sold it in 1926 to John Bisset &amp; Co Ltd of Leith. They were taken over by the Distillers Company Ltd in 1943.

Due to restrictions on the use of barley for distilling during the Second World War a majority of Scotch Whisky distilleries closed, including the Royal Brackla Distillery from 1943 until 1945. An airfield was built beside the distillery in 1940, to provide a landing ground for operational training and air gunnery.

1964 saw the distillery close its doors again until 1966, this was due to major reconstruction and re-planning. The traditional method of coal-firing the stills by hand was changed to internal heating by steam generated from a coal-fired boiler. In 1965 an underground supply of water, created during the Second World War for an airfield, was acquired and used for cooling spirit vapour.

In 1970, the distillery was expanded by adding a second pair of stills and converting the coal-fired boiler to oil-fired. New racked warehouses were built in 1975 to replace the older traditional warehouses that were still in use at the time.

The Royal Brackla Distillery closed again in 1985. The casks of whisky remained on site in the warehouses where they continued to mature and be used for blending, as required by the owners. The distillery reopened in 1991.

In 1998, the distillery started to be operated by John Dewar &amp; Sons, a subsidiary of Bacardi.

In 2019, Bacardi relaunch Royal Brackla single malts, consisting of Royal Brackla 12 Years Old finished in Oloroso sherry casks, Royal Brackla 18 Years Old finished in Palo Cortado Sherry casks and Royal Brackla 21 Years Old finished in Oloroso, Palo Cortado and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks.

==Methods of production==
Royal Brackla has a mash tun of and eight wash backs with a total volume of . Cawdor Burn has been the constant water supply for Royal Brackla, with the Cursack Springs being used for mashing.

The distillery uses four stills to produce its whisky, two wash stills with a combined capacity of i and two spirit stills that have combined capacity of 42,000 litres. The fermentation process lasts for a total of 70 hours and is followed by the distillation process. Tall Royal Brackla stills, designed to allow plenty of reflux, are operated slowly in the distillation process to smooth the blend to maximise copper contact and produce a light spirit. The final stage is maturation and this takes place in oak casks.

==Proprietary bottlings==
1991: To commemorate the re-opening of Royal Brackla Distillery, a special 60-year-old Royal Brackla single malt was released. It was claimed the cask (from 1924) was discovered in a warehouse in 1984. 40%, 70cl.

1993: Royal Brackla was released as a 10-year-old in the Flora and Fauna series, produced by United Distillers. The label featured a small bird called a siskin. 43%, 70cl.

1998: Part of United Distillers Rare Malts Collection included a bottling of Royal Brackla at 20 years old. It was distilled in 1978 and was cask strength. 50.8%, 70cl.

1999: John Dewar &amp; Sons Ltd released a minor bottling of Royal Brackla with a burgundy label and no age statement. 40%, 70cl.

2003: A limited edition 25-year-old was released for the keepers of the Quaich, each label signed by Tom Aitken, John Dewar &amp; Sons&#x27; sixth Master Blender. 43%, 70cl.

<doc id="335289" wikidata="Q2746376" url="?curid=335289" title="Jim Leyland">
<text>James Richard Leyland (born December 15, 1944) is an American former professional baseball player, coach and manager. He serves as a special assistant to the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB).

Leyland led the Florida Marlins to the 1997 World Series championship over the Cleveland Indians, and previously won three straight division titles (1990, 1991, and 1992) with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He is one of eleven managers to lead three different teams to the postseason. With the Tigers&#x27; victory in the 2006 American League Championship Series, Leyland became the seventh manager in history to win pennants in both the National and American Leagues.

Leyland is a three-time Manager of the Year Award winner, twice in the National League (1990 and 1992), and once in the American League (2006). He managed the United States national team at the 2017 World Baseball Classic, leading the team to its first gold medal finish. On December 3, 2023, Leyland was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
James Richard Leyland was born on December 15, 1944, in Perrysburg, Ohio. His father worked in a glass factory and his mother was a stay-at-home mother of seven children. Leyland&#x27;s first baseball team was part of a Knights of Columbus league. Leyland graduated from Perrysburg High School in Perrysburg, Ohio, in 1962, where he excelled in baseball.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Leyland began his baseball career with the Detroit Tigers when they signed him as a catcher on September 21, 1963. He spent seven seasons as a minor leaguer in the Tigers organization (1964–1970), but mainly served as a coach with the Montgomery Rebels in 1970 while playing in just two games for the team. Leyland was a career .222 hitter in the minor leagues.

==Coaching career==
Leyland left the Tigers organization for the first time in 1982 when he became Tony La Russa&#x27;s third base coach for four seasons (1982–85) with the Chicago White Sox, including the team&#x27;s 1983 AL West division title.

==Managerial career==
===Minor leagues===
In 1972, Leyland became a minor league manager in the Tigers organization; beginning with the Clinton Pilots of the Midwest League; from 1979 to 1981, he was the manager of the Evansville Triplets winning two divisions (1979, 1981) in the American Association.

===Pittsburgh Pirates (1986–1996)===
On November 20, 1985, Leyland was named as the 33rd manager in Pittsburgh Pirates franchise history, managing the team from 1986 to 1996 where he won two Manager of the Year trophies in 1990 and 1992, and finished as runner-up in 1988 and 1991. Leyland helped develop such All-Stars as Barry Bonds, Jay Bell, Tim Wakefield, Andy Van Slyke and Bobby Bonilla in Pittsburgh before a fire sale in the mid-1990s soured him with new ownership. Under Leyland, the Pirates captured the National League Eastern Division title and went to the National League Championship Series in three straight seasons (1990, 1991, and 1992). Pittsburgh averaged 96 regular season victories over those three years, although lost all three times in the NLCS with the latter two going the full seven games against the Atlanta Braves. The Pirates lost to the Cincinnati Reds (four games to two) in the 1990 NLCS.

Leyland quit after 11 seasons spent with the Pirates in order to manage a contender despite a contract which ran to 2000 with a salary of $1 million, stating it was not a tough decision but a sad one, noting his dissatisfaction with owner Kevin McClatchy on trades and salary cutting.

One member of Leyland&#x27;s coaching staff while with the Pirates, Terry Collins, who was most recently the manager of the New York Mets, wore number 10 to honor Leyland.

===Florida Marlins (1997–1998)===
In 1997, Leyland was hired by Wayne Huizenga to manage the Florida Marlins and promptly led them to the franchise&#x27;s first World Championship that year, defeating the Cleveland Indians—four games to three—in the Fall Classic. The Marlins, in only their fifth year of existence, became the fastest expansion franchise to win a World Series. The Arizona Diamondbacks surpassed the Marlins when they won the World Series in 2001, their fourth season.

In the offseason, Huizenga dismantled the team in a fire sale. After Game 7, when asked about rumors that he might retire if Huizenga sold the franchise, Leyland quipped, &quot;My wife doesn&#x27;t like me that much. I can&#x27;t retire.&quot; Leyland remained as the manager, but resigned after the 1998 season, when the Marlins went 54–108. Due to the details of his contract (alongside the team finding itself in the process of being sold), he received a $500,000 buyout for the remaining three years of his five-year contract.

===Colorado Rockies (1999)===
Leyland was subsequently hired by the Colorado Rockies for the 1999 season. Leyland reached 1,000 wins on April 15, leading the Rockies to a 6–4 win over the San Diego Padres at Coors Field. He achieved the feat in his 2,048th game as manager. Leyland ultimately came to regret the decision to manage in Colorado, saying that while he was treated well by the team, he felt he could not manage well with Coors Field in regard to pitching, as he described himself as &quot;pitcher&#x27;s manager.&quot; He walked away from the final two years of his contract after one season. It was the fifth time in Leyland&#x27;s 14 seasons that he skippered a team that finished last in its division. After this, he became a Pittsburgh-based scout for the St. Louis Cardinals.

===Detroit Tigers (2006–2013)===
Following the release of Alan Trammell as the manager of the Tigers, Leyland was hired as new Tigers manager, returning to the franchise with which he spent the first 18 years of his professional baseball career. It marked the first time Leyland managed in the American League.
In the 2006 regular season, Leyland guided the Tigers to a 95–67 record, the Tigers&#x27; best season since 1987. The Tigers entered the playoffs as a wild card, and went on to defeat the New York Yankees and sweep the Oakland Athletics to win the American League pennant before falling to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 World Series. In leading the team to the AL pennant, he became the seventh manager to win pennants in both major leagues, joining Joe McCarthy, Yogi Berra, Alvin Dark, Sparky Anderson, Dick Williams, and Tony La Russa. After the 2006 season ended, Leyland was recognized with the Manager of the Year award for the third time in his career. He became the third person to win the award in both leagues, joining La Russa and Bobby Cox. Leyland also won the &quot;Sporting News&quot; Manager of the Year Award for the American League in 2006.

The Tigers had heightened expectations after the pennant, but they muddled through the next four seasons, which included a last place finish in 2008 (the sixth and last time Leyland had skippered a last place team). Leyland would reach 1,500 wins on April 15, 2011, with a win over the Oakland Athletics, becoming the 19th manager to do so. That year, he would lead the Tigers to another 95–67 regular season record (an improvement of 14 wins), winning the American League Central Division. They went on to defeat the New York Yankees in the American League Division Series before losing to the Texas Rangers in the American League Championship Series.
On May 1, 2012, Leyland gained his 1,600th victory as a major league manager, passing Tommy Lasorda on the all-time wins list. In 2012, Leyland led the Tigers to an 88–74 regular season record, winning the American League Central Division. On that team, Tigers third baseman Miguel Cabrera was the American League Triple Crown winner that season. This was the first Triple Crown winner in Major League Baseball since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967. When the Tigers won the AL Central for the second consecutive season, Leyland became the only Tigers manager besides Hughie Jennings to lead Detroit to the postseason three times.

In the 2012 postseason, Detroit defeated the Athletics in a five-game ALDS and returned to the World Series following a sweep of the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series. Detroit was swept in the 2012 World Series by the San Francisco Giants. They were shut out twice, the same number as in the entire 162-game regular season, and had a team batting average of .159.

On September 25, 2013, Leyland won his 700th game with the Tigers. With the 1–0 victory over the Minnesota Twins, the Tigers clinched their third consecutive American League Central Division title. Leyland joined former coach Tony La Russa as the only managers who have led two different MLB franchises to three consecutive division titles. Of the eleven managers to have won three pennants, seven did so in the divisional era, and Leyland has the second most playoff appearances to have won three pennants with eight, with only Terry Francona having more appearances. His 44 postseason wins are tied for fourth most in MLB history with Bruce Bochy, while his 40 losses are fourth most. He retired from managing following the 2013 season, remaining with the Tigers organization as a special assistant. He was replaced by Brad Ausmus.

===Team USA===
On April 15, 2016, Leyland was named the manager of Team USA at the 2017 World Baseball Classic. The United States won the 2017 tournament under his leadership, making Leyland the only manager to win a World Series and a WBC title.

==Honors==
On May 30, 2017, Leyland was one of eight new inductees announced for the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in Detroit. The ceremony took place on September 15, 2017.

On December 3, 2023, Leyland was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame Class of 2024, and was enshrined on July 21, 2024. He was subsequently selected to the Pittsburgh Pirates Hall of Fame in May 2024.

Leyland&#x27;s number 10 was retired by the Tigers on August 3, 2024.

==Managerial record==
==Personal life==
Leyland still keeps his home in the Pittsburgh suburb of Thornburg, Pennsylvania, where he has raised two children, Patrick and Kellie with his wife Katie. His son, Pat, a catcher/first baseman, was drafted by the Tigers in 2010 and also played in the Seattle Mariners and Baltimore Orioles organizations through 2015.

Leyland is a practicing Catholic. His brother Tom Leyland was a priest of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Toledo for 55 years until his death in 2020, and two of his aunts were Ursuline nuns.

<doc id="335291" wikidata="Q1062219" url="?curid=335291" title="Dontrelle Willis">
<text>Dontrelle Wayne Willis (born January 12, 1982), nicknamed &quot;the D-Train&quot;, is an American former professional baseball pitcher. A left-hander, he played in Major League Baseball for the Florida Marlins, Detroit Tigers, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Cincinnati Reds. Willis was notable for his success during his first few years in the major leagues and for his unconventional pitching style, which included a high leg kick and exaggerated twisting away from the batter. He was named the 2003 National League Rookie of the Year and won the World Series in the same year.

Willis joined the television broadcast team of the Los Angeles Dodgers in May 2022. He is also a regular studio and game analyst for Fox Sports 1 and AppleTV+.

==Early life==
Willis was raised by his mother, Joyce, a welder, in Alameda, California. She played in elite-level softball leagues when Willis was a child. Willis never knew his father, Clinton Ostah, who was a minor league player in the 1970s. Growing up, Willis rooted for the Oakland Athletics as a child. Willis&#x27; favorite player was former Oakland Athletics&#x27; pitcher Dave Stewart.

==Career==
===Early career===
Willis attended Encinal High School in Alameda, where he played baseball for four years. In Willis&#x27; senior year in 2000, he had a 0.70 earned run average (ERA) with 111 strikeouts in 70 innings pitched and was named California Player of the Year. He initially committed to play college baseball at Arizona State. He was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the eighth round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft.

In 2001, Willis was promoted to the Boise Hawks of the Northwest League. He finished with eight wins and a 2.98 ERA. Opposing hitters only batted .217 against Willis. In a &quot;Baseball America&quot; poll, several Northwest managers said that Willis was Boise&#x27;s best player.

===Florida Marlins===
On March 27, 2002, the Cubs traded Willis, fellow pitchers Julián Tavárez and José Cueto, and catcher Ryan Jorgensen to the Florida Marlins, in exchange for pitchers Matt Clement and Antonio Alfonseca.

After being traded, Willis struggled early on. However, Willis started to get better as he got to low Class A ball. By the end of the season, he had a 10–2 win–loss record and finished the season with the Class-A Jupiter Hammerheads. In five starts, he went 2–0 with a 1.83 ERA, leading the Midwest League in ERA. For his performance, he was named the Marlins&#x27; Minor League Pitcher of the Year.

In the 2003 spring training, Willis reported to Jupiter. The plan was to start him with the Class-AA Carolina Mudcats. The hope was that he would make the leap to AAA, and potentially be available for a spot start in Florida or a back-of-the-bullpen job late in the season. The Marlins then sent Willis down to Carolina to work on consistency and control. Willis went 4–0 with a 1.49 ERA for Carolina.

====2003 season====
On May 9, 2003, Willis made his major league debut for the Florida Marlins against the Colorado Rockies. He pitched six innings, allowed seven hits and three earned runs, and got a no decision. On May 14, in a start against the Padres, Willis went five innings, allowed five hits, three earned runs, and four walks, and received his first Major League win. On June 16, Willis pitched nine innings and allowed no runs in a 1–0 victory over the Mets in his first career shutout. Willis&#x27; opponent in that game was Tom Glavine, one of his childhood heroes.

Willis was named the National League Rookie of the Month for June 2003, becoming the first Marlins pitcher to be named Pitcher of the Month. He became the first rookie pitcher to win Pitcher of the Month since Hideo Nomo in 1995 and he became the first rookie pitcher to win seven straight starts since Jason Isringhausen, also in 1995. In five starts, Willis went 5–0 with a 1.04 ERA. Heading into the All-Star Break in mid-July, Willis was 9–1 with a 2.08 ERA in 13 starts. He made the National League All-Star team as injury replacement for Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown. He became the second Marlins rookie to make the All-Star team; Alex González did it in 1999.

After coming out of the bullpen in game 1 of the 2003 National League Division Series against the Giants, Willis started game 4 of the series. In innings pitched, Willis allowed five hits, two walks, and struck out three batters, but allowed five earned runs. Despite struggling with his pitching, Willis batted 3-for-3 with a triple and scoring a run during that game, which the Marlins won 7–6 to advance to the NL Championship Series against the Cubs, the team that drafted Willis. In game 4, Willis again struggled with his command. In innings pitched, he allowed three hits and five walks, and Willis took the loss. His only other appearance in the series was in game 6, when he allowed a run in one inning of relief. Despite his limited contributions, the Marlins went on to defeat the Cubs in seven games. The Marlins then defeated the New York Yankees in the 2003 World Series.

After the 2003 season, Willis was named the National League Rookie of the Year. He went 14–6 with a 3.30 ERA in 27 starts for the year.

====2004 season====
In 2004, Willis started the year 3–0, and did not allow an earned run in his first three starts. In his first two starts, Willis batted 6-for-6 with a home run. His seven consecutive hits in the regular season was one short of the club record held by Gary Sheffield and Preston Wilson. In his next start against the Phillies, Willis struck out in his first at bat, snapping his streak of 10 consecutive hits dating back to previous year&#x27;s postseason. Willis finished the 2004 season with a record of 10–11 and an ERA of 4.02.

====2005 season====
In 2005, Willis started the 2005 season by pitching two shutouts against the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. During the month of April, Willis went 5–0 in five starts and allowed five earned runs in 35 innings pitched for a 1.29 ERA. He was named NL Pitcher of the Month.

On May 6, Willis became the league&#x27;s first six-game winner when he went seven innings and allowed no runs against the Rockies. On June 8, Willis became the major league&#x27;s first 10-game winner when he pitched the Marlins to a 5–4 victory over the Seattle Mariners, allowing four runs. Willis became only the third pitcher in Marlins history to record 10 wins before the All-Star break.
On June 23, Willis became the NL&#x27;s first 12-game winner when he pitched a shutout against the Braves.

Going into the All-Star break, Willis was 13–4 with a 2.39 ERA and a 1.14 walks plus hits per inning pitched. Willis was named to the All-Star team but did not pitch in the game. After the All-Star break, Willis went 9–6 and posted a 2.91 ERA and a 1.13 walks plus hits per innings pitched the rest of the season.

During his last start before the All-Star break, Willis struggled against the Cubs. In innings, he allowed eight runs, all earned. He struggled in each of his first two starts after the break, failing to make it past the sixth inning in games against the Philadelphia Phillies and San Francisco Giants. Willis matched his highest win total on July 28 against the Pirates when he went seven innings, allowed three hits, no earned runs, and picked up his 14th victory of the season, which tied his career high for most wins in a season. Willis won his career-high 15th victory on August 7 against the Reds. He went eight innings, allowed four hits, and no earned runs. On August 17, Willis held the Padres scoreless by shutting the Padres out in nine innings, earning him his 16th win of the season, second most in baseball. The win put Florida one-and-a-half games behind Houston and Philadelphia in the wild card standings.

Willis won his 19th game of the season against the Mets on September 2, breaking Carl Pavano&#x27;s franchise record for most wins in a season. Pavano held the Marlins&#x27; mark for most victories in a season by a Marlins&#x27; pitcher for a year. On September 7 against the Washington Nationals, Willis pitched six innings and allowed one earned run, which gave him his 20th win of the season. He became the first African-American pitcher to win 20 games in a season since Dave Stewart did it in 1990, and in the process, he became the first pitcher to win 20 games and have 20 hits as a batter since Mike Hampton did it in 1999 for the Astros. On September 22, Willis became the first pitcher to bat seventh or higher since Montreal&#x27;s Steve Renko batted seventh on August 26, 1973. Willis went 1-for-4 against the New York Mets. He posted a 22–10 record with a 2.63 ERA and 1.13 walks plus hits per innings pitched. His 22 wins was the most in baseball. He also pitched seven complete games and five shutouts, also the most in baseball. Willis is still the only pitcher in Marlins history to win 20 games in a season.

Willis finished 2nd in the N.L. Cy Young Award voting behind Chris Carpenter of the St. Louis Cardinals. He won the Warren Spahn Award, given to the best left-handed pitcher in each league.

====2006 season====
In the 2006 season, Willis&#x27; numbers were down from his great 2005 season. Willis started the season by going 1–6 with a 4.93 ERA and did not get his second victory of the season until June 2. He still posted decent numbers for the year and went 12–12 with a 3.87 ERA, including 11–6 with a 3.39 ERA from June to September. His 12 wins were tied for the most on the Marlins. Willis also led the Marlins in complete games (4), innings pitched (), walks (83), and hit by pitch (19).

On June 20, Willis earned his 50th career win in a start against the Baltimore Orioles.

On July 7, Willis hit a grand slam off of Mets pitcher José Lima, becoming the first pitcher to hit a grand slam since Robert Person did it in 2002. It was his fourth career home run. On September 20, 2006, he hit two home runs, off of Óliver Pérez and Roberto Hernández. He became the first pitcher since Randy Wolf in 2004 to hit two home runs in a game.

====2007 season====
On January 15, 2007, Willis signed a one-year contract with the Marlins for $6.45 million, avoiding salary arbitration.

In the 2007 season, Willis went 10–15 with a 5.17 ERA and a 1.60 walks plus hits per innings pitched. Up to that point, it was his worst season of his career. Willis led the National League in earned runs allowed with 118.

During his career with the Marlins, Willis went 68–54 with a 3.78 ERA. He won at least 10 games each season during all five of his years with the Marlins from 2003 to 2007.

===Detroit Tigers===
On December 5, 2007, the Marlins traded Willis along with fellow All-Star Miguel Cabrera to the Detroit Tigers for Andrew Miller, Cameron Maybin, Mike Rabelo, Eulogio de la Cruz, Dallas Trahern, and Burke Badenhop. Willis signed a three-year, $29 million contract extension two weeks later. In his debut with the Tigers, Willis pitched five innings, gave up one hit, and three earned runs against the Chicago White Sox.

In his next start, also against the White Sox, Willis injured his left knee and departed the game before even recording an out. Placed on the disabled list the next day, Willis had walked nine batters while striking out none in his first two outings. Command of his pitches became a trouble spot, and later in the season, Tiger manager Jim Leyland pitched him in relief for the first time, with little success. He was placed back into the rotation on June 3, 2008, to start in a loss against the Oakland Athletics.

On June 10, 2008, Willis was demoted to the Single-A Lakeland Tigers, a day after a start in which he gave up eight earned runs and five walks in innings pitched against the Cleveland Indians. Though Willis had enough service time in the major leagues to require his consent prior to the send-down, he agreed, saying he needed to work on his control. Willis was called back to the Tigers in time for the roster expansion on September 1, 2008. He made three starts, recording a loss and two no-decisions. Willis finished with a 0–2 record and a 9.17 ERA. In 24 innings pitched, Willis struggled with his control and walked 35 batters.

Willis was placed on the 15-day disabled list in March 2009 for an anxiety disorder after a blood test showed something of concern; he began a treatment regimen aimed at addressing the condition. Willis was taken off the disabled list and placed on the active roster May 13, 2009, when he made his first start of the 2009 season. Willis made seven starts after returning, with poor results, before being returned to the disabled list on June 19 with the same anxiety issue. In Willis&#x27; last start of the season, he allowed six earned runs allowed and eight walks. Willis finished the season with a 1–4 record and a 7.49 ERA.

In Spring training 2010, Willis made the Tigers starting rotation. On April 8, 2010, Willis started against the Kansas City Royals, giving the Tigers six innings and recording a no-decision. He gave up two earned runs, walking two and striking out four.

On May 30, 2010, Willis was designated for assignment by the Tigers. In his career with the Tigers, Willis played in 24 games (22 starts). His record was 2–8 and had a 6.86 ERA in 101 innings pitched.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
On June 1, 2010, Willis was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for starting pitcher Billy Buckner. He changed back to his former uniform number 35, which he wore for the Marlins. In his Diamondback debut, he pitched six scoreless innings with four walks and three strikeouts. He got his first win as a member of the Diamondbacks. Willis pitched four innings, giving up two runs and three hits, walking six batters on June 10. During the second inning, he cracked a finger nail and after the fourth inning, he was removed from the game due to the pain on the fingernail.

In six games (five starts) with the Diamondbacks, Willis went 1–1 with a 6.85 ERA in innings pitched. On July 4, 2010, Willis was designated for assignment and subsequently released.

===San Francisco Giants===
On July 15, 2010, Willis was signed to a minor league contract by San Francisco and began pitching for the Fresno Grizzlies of the Pacific Coast League. On November 6, 2010, Willis was granted free agency.

===Cincinnati Reds===

Willis signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds for the 2011 season. He was invited to spring training, for a chance at starter or bullpen.
Willis was reassigned to the Louisville Bats as of March 27, 2011. Willis was called up on July 10 and made his Reds debut against Milwaukee at Miller Park. Willis pitched six innings, giving up two runs while striking out four and walking four. He also contributed on offense, going 1-for-2 with a double. Willis made his second start for Cincinnati on July 18, 2011, at PNC Park against the Pittsburgh Pirates. On August 3, Willis started, going six innings and hitting a solo home run but was charged with a no-decision.

On August 9, Willis pitched eight innings, struck out 10 batters, and allowed three earned runs against the Rockies but was charged with the loss. His 10 strikeouts was the most he had got in a start since he struck out 11 against the Diamondbacks on August 14, 2007. His eight innings pitched was the most innings he pitched since his last start with the Florida Marlins, where he pitched eight innings against the Cubs on September 25, 2007. On August 14, Willis pitched innings and allowed four earned runs against the San Diego Padres. Prior to the start, Willis said that his forearm was still a little tight after he had warmed up in the bullpen earlier.

===Later career===
On December 15, 2011, Willis agreed to a one-year deal worth $1 million with the Philadelphia Phillies, and was expected to pitch out of the bullpen. He was released on March 16, 2012, after just three Grapefruit League appearances. Willis signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles on March 20. A left forearm strain suffered on April 12 led to a dispute with the organization which wanted him to be a relief pitcher. Desiring to be a starter again, he placed the blame for the injury on working out of the bullpen. In his only start after the problem was resolved, he surrendered four runs and six hits in innings pitched. He made four appearances with the Norfolk Tides, going 0–3 with an 8.53 ERA while allowing eight runs and ten hits in innings. He announced his retirement as an active player on July 2, 2012.

On January 3, 2013, Willis signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs. He left his first game in spring training after seven pitches, and came out of the game with a shoulder injury. The Cubs released Willis on March 30, 2013.

On April 5, 2013, Willis signed a contract with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League. He compiled the best ERA in the Atlantic League, posting a 2.56 ERA through 14 starts. Willis pitched to a 5–4 record and struck out 52 batters in innings. By August 3, he was tied for second in the league in complete games with three. His efforts earned him an Atlantic League All-Star selection, and he was chosen as the starting pitcher for the Liberty Division, tossing a perfect inning. On August 8, 2013, the Angels signed Willis to a minor-league contract and assigned him to their AAA affiliate, the Salt Lake Bees.

Willis signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants on January 10, 2014, and was later released on April 16, 2014. On July 5, 2014, the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League, reported they had agreed to verbal contract terms with Willis. He made his first start with the Bluefish on July 18, 2014.

On January 21, 2015, Willis signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. However, on March 13, 2015, he announced his retirement.

<doc id="335296" wikidata="Q3098181" url="?curid=335296" title="Arkansas Razorbacks">
<text>The Arkansas Razorbacks, also known as the Hogs, are the intercollegiate athletics teams representing the University of Arkansas, located in Fayetteville. The University of Arkansas student body voted to change the name of the school mascot (originally the Cardinals) in 1910 to the Arkansas Razorbacks after a hard-fought battle against LSU in which they were said to play like a &quot;wild band of Razorback hogs&quot; by former coach Hugo Bezdek. The Arkansas Razorbacks are the only major sports team in the U.S. with a porcine nickname, though the Texas A&amp;M–Kingsville Javelinas play in Division II.

The University of Arkansas currently fields 19 total varsity teams (eight men&#x27;s and 11 women&#x27;s) in 13 sports, and competes at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I (Football Bowl Subdivision in football) level as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC).

==History==
After classes were first held at the university, a contest was held on campus to select school colors. Cardinal (a shade of deep red) was selected over heliotrope, a shade of moderate purple. The first Arkansas football team was formed that same year and was known as the &quot;Arkansas Cardinals&quot;. Arkansas merchandise sold at the highest levels in school history during the 2012–13 academic year when royalties through CLC ranked 10th best in the nation.

In 1909, the football team finished a 7–0 season, allowing only 18 points on defense and scoring 186 points on offense. College Football Hall of Fame coach Hugo Bezdek proclaimed his team played &quot;like a wild band of razorback hogs&quot;. The name proved so popular that it was changed for the 1910 season. The tradition of calling the hogs, &quot;Woo, Pig! Sooie&quot; was added in the 1920s.

In 1957, Frank Broyles was hired as the head football coach and served in that position for 19 years (1957-1976). Broyles&#x27; team was awarded the 1964 National Championship by the Football Writers Association of America and the Helms Athletic Foundation. At the time, the AP Poll and UPI Coaches Poll both awarded their championships before bowl games, and they gave their awards to an undefeated Alabama. However, Alabama lost the 1965 Orange Bowl game to Texas (a team Arkansas defeated in Austin, TX 14-13), while Arkansas won the 1965 Cotton Bowl Classic against Nebraska. The FWAA and HAF both awarded their national championship designations to Arkansas, who was the only team to go undefeated through the bowl games that year. Both the University of Arkansas and the University of Alabama claimed national championships for 1964.

In 1969, Broyles&#x27; team was ranked #2 and played the #1-ranked Texas Longhorns, coached by Darrell Royal, in Fayetteville. The game, known as &quot;The Big Shootout&quot; is perhaps the most notable football game in Razorback history. President Richard Nixon was even in attendance. The Razorbacks led 14–0 until the 4th quarter when Texas scored 15 unanswered points and won the game 15-14. Nixon gave Texas the UPI national championship trophy after the game. In the second half, Arkansas missed a field goal attempt, and then turned the ball over inside the Texas 5 yard line on another possession. 

After Broyles left coaching to focus on his other job as Athletic Director, he hired Lou Holtz to take over his former position. Holtz served as the head football coach from 1977 through the 1983 season. Under Holtz, the Razorbacks continued their success, beating Oklahoma in the 1978 Orange Bowl to finish the 1977 season 11-1 overall and ranked #3 in the final polls. After finishing the 1978 season 9-2-1 with a tie against UCLA in the 1978 Fiesta Bowl, Arkansas won a share of the Southwest Conference championship in 1979, but lost to Alabama in the 1980 Sugar Bowl to finish 10-2. Holtz&#x27;s last four teams finished 7-5 in 1980, 8-4 in 1981, 9-2-1 in 1982, and 6-5 in 1983. 

In 1971, the women&#x27;s athletic department was formed. On January 1, 2008, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s athletic departments merged along with a new athletic director.

The basketball team rose to prominence in the 1970s now under the coaching of Eddie Sutton and with future NBA star Sidney Moncrief along with Marvin Delph and Ron Brewer, three similarly sized Arkansas-bred guards, known as &quot;The Triplets&quot;. The team made a Final Four appearance under him, finishing 3rd by defeating Notre Dame on a last-second shot in the now-defunct consolation game. 

In the 1980s, the football team was now coached by former Razorback All-American Ken Hatfield (1984-1989), and established itself as a powerful running team. The Razorbacks challenged for the SWC title each year, winning the conference championship in 1988 and 1989, and went to the Cotton Bowl Classic twice. Hatfield&#x27;s teams established excellent regular-season records, but had difficulty winning bowl games, finishing 1-5 in bowls under Hatfield.

In 1990, Broyles announced that the Razorbacks would leave the Southwest Conference and join the Southeastern Conference beginning in the 1991-92 school year (the football team would play the 1991 season in the SWC while all other sports would compete in the SEC), setting off a major realignment in college football. Now with twelve teams, the SEC broke up into two separate divisions with Arkansas in the West with Alabama, Auburn, Ole Miss, Mississippi State, and LSU. In 1995, the Arkansas Razorbacks won its first SEC Western Division Title in football, but lost to East Division champion Florida in the SEC Championship Game. 

In 1994, Nolan Richardson&#x27;s basketball Razorbacks won the NCAA Tournament. His basketball teams challenged for the SEC and national championships regularly during the 1990s, making three trips to the Final Four (1990, 1994, 1995) and two to the championship game while compiling a record of 389–169 (.697) in his 17 years as the head basketball coach.

On December 10, 1997, Houston Nutt (1998-2007) was hired as head football coach for the Razorbacks to replace Danny Ford, who had been head coach since 1993, and the 1998 season was his first full season. Highly sought after as a Little Rock Central quarterback, Nutt had been the last recruit to sign under Broyles, but transferred to Oklahoma State University because he did not fit Holtz&#x27;s offensive plans. Nutt would guide the Hogs to 3 SEC West Division title in 1998, 2002, and 2006, plus bowl victories over Texas in the 2000 Cotton Bowl Classic and over Missouri in the 2003 Independence Bowl. Nutt also coached running back Darren McFadden from 2005 to 2007, who would finish his career at Arkansas as the all-time leading rusher in school history, as well as the most decorated player to ever wear a Razorback football uniform. McFadden would be 1st team All-SEC for three years in a row, 1st team All-American in 2006 and 2007, and he would win the Doak Walker Award as the nation&#x27;s best RB in 2006 and 2007, and the Walter Camp Award in 2007 as the nation&#x27;s most outstanding player. McFadden would also finish as runner-up for the Heisman Trophy in 2006 and 2007. 

Soon after Houston Dale Nutt&#x27;s departure, two significant things happened. First, AD Broyles retired, and he was replaced by new AD Jeff Long (2008-2017). Second, Long then hired Atlanta Falcons head coach Bobby Petrino (2008-2011), who abruptly departed the NFL to lead the Hogs. After a losing record in his first season, and finishing 8-5 in 2009 after winning the 2010 Liberty Bowl, Petrino led the team to a BCS game in 2010, but lost to Ohio State in the 2011 Sugar Bowl to finish the season 10-3. In 2011 his team would finish 11-2 and ranked #5 in the final polls after beating Kansas State in the 2012 Cotton Bowl Classic, thanks to a heavy passing attack. On April 1, 2012, Petrino drove his motorcycle into a ditch with a passenger aboard. He was fired after it was revealed this passenger was his mistress whom he had hired onto his staff. AD Jeff Long introduced special teams coordinator, and former Michigan State head coach, John L. Smith as the interim coach for the 2012 season in late April.

Smith entered the season as the steward of a preseason Top 10 squad with multiple preseason Heisman hopefuls. He recorded the school&#x27;s first loss to a Sunbelt team in the program&#x27;s 100-year history as Louisiana Monroe pulled the upset in Little Rock. In only his second game, he had managed the second-largest drop from the AP ranking narrowly missing the #1 spot held by Michigan after losing the season opener to Appalachian State just five years before. 

In 2011, Long hired former Nolan Richardson assistant coach Mike Anderson (2011-2019) as the new men&#x27;s basketball head coach. Anderson&#x27;s tenure was an up-and-down roller coaster, featuring highs such as a last second victory over Kentucky in 2015, plus NCAA tournament teams in 2015, 2017, and 2018. But Anderson ultimately failed to take the Razorbacks back to national prominence on a consistent basis, and he was let go by new AD Hunter Yurachek after the 2018-2019 season. 

Yurachek then hired Nevada coach Eric Musselman to take over as the new head coach in the 2019-2020 season. Following a 20 win first year, Musselman coached his next two teams to the NCAA&#x27;s Elite Eight in the 2021 and 2022 tournaments. Both teams finished ranked in the AP Top 20 and the UPI Top 10. 

On December 4, 2012, the school named former University of Wisconsin coach Bret Bielema (2013-2017) as head coach for the 2013 season. Coach Bielema rebuilt the team around a power running game and strong defense and led the Hogs back to a winning record in 2014 including back-to-back shutouts over top ten teams, the first time in history such a feat had been accomplished by an unranked team, and a victory over Texas in the 2014 Texas Bowl at the end of the season. Bielema would coach Arkansas to another bowl victory in 2015, beating Kansas State in the 2016 Liberty Bowl. However, his team collapsed in the last couple of games in 2016, and then stumbled to a losing record in 2017. AD Jeff Long had already been let go by the school prior to the end of the 2017 season, and interim AD Julie Cromer fired Bielema after the final game. 

Cromer then hired SMU head coach Chad Morris (2018-2019) as the new head coach after the 2017 season. Cromer would then leave Arkansas to become the AD at Ohio University in the summer of 2019 after she was replaced by current Athletics Director Hunter Yurachek in early 2018. Morris&#x27; tenure as the head coach of the football team is considered one of the worst in school history. Over one full season, and a shortened second season, Morris never won an SEC game, and both of his teams would finish with abysmal records of 2-10. Yurachek fired Morris with two games left in the 2019 season, and promoted tight ends coach Barry Lunney Jr to interim head coach for the final two games. Lunney left after the season was over, and Yurachek hired Georgia offensive line coach Sam Pittman as Arkansas&#x27; new head coach. Pittman had been the Razorbacks offensive line coach under Bielema from 2013 to 2015, and had produced some of the best linemen, and offensive lines, in school history. Several former players signed a petition asking Yurachek to hire Pittman. 

In 2020, Arkansas only played ten games (all teams from the SEC) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Arkansas&#x27; last conference victory had been on October 28, 2017 against Ole Miss. On October 3, 2020, Pittman&#x27;s Razorbacks broke a 20-game SEC losing streak by defeating Mississippi St in Starkville, 21-14. The team would finish the SEC-only season at 3-7, also beating Ole Miss and Tennessee. Pittman&#x27;s 2021 squad would improve upon the previous season in a big way, going 9-4 overall after beating Penn State in the 2022 Outback Bowl on New Year&#x27;s Day, and finish ranked in the final AP Top 25 at #21. Pittman would be named the 2021 AFCA Region 2 Coach of the Year.

===Men&#x27;s sports===

====Baseball====
The baseball team, led by former Razorback Dave Van Horn, has reached the postseason NCAA tournament every year except one (2016) since he began coaching the team in 2003. In 2012, they reached the College World Series compiling a 2–0 record in Omaha before falling in consecutive games to two times defending national champion South Carolina in the championship of Bracket Two. South Carolina was defeated in the National Championship Series by Arizona.

The Razorbacks most recently also reached the 2018 College World Series where they finished runner-up to Oregon State, joining previous appearances in Omaha in 1979 (finished runner-up); 1985; 1987, 1989, 2004, 2009, and 2015. The team plays home games at Baum Stadium, located just south of campus, and which finished several major renovations in 2004 and 2009.

Many Razorbacks players have gone on to the majors, perhaps the most successful is Cliff Lee, the 2008 AL Cy Young Award Winner, with the most recent being Dallas Keuchel of the Houston Astros.

====Basketball====
The basketball team plays its home games in Bud Walton Arena on the University of Arkansas campus. One of the top 10 NCAA programs of all time, the Razorbacks were ushered into the modern era on the shoulders of Coach Eddie Sutton (800 game-winner). Under the leadership of Nolan Richardson, the Razorbacks won the NCAA tournament in 1994 defeating Duke University, and appeared in the championship game the following year, but were beaten by UCLA. The Razorbacks have been to NCAA Final Four in 1941, 1945, 1978, 1990, 1994 and 1995, though the first two were achieved before the NCAA gathered the final four teams in one site.

The current head coach for the men&#x27;s basketball team is John Calipari. Calipari replaced former head coach Eric Musselman who lead Arkansas to two Elite Eights and a Sweet Sixteen appearance. On March 26, 2007, Stan Heath was fired as the head coach of the men&#x27;s basketball team. John Pelphrey ultimately replaced Heath and made the 2008 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, but did not make any subsequent postseason appearances and was fired after the 2010–11 season. Pelphrey compiled a 69–59 overall record and 25–39 SEC conference record while at Arkansas. Mike Anderson was announced as the new men&#x27;s Basketball head coach on March 23, 2011.

====Football====
The football team plays its home games either at Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium, located on the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville, or at War Memorial Stadium, located in Little Rock. In 1964, the Razorbacks were the only team to go through the regular season and a bowl game undefeated, and they were awarded the Football Writers Association of America National Championship. The 1969 team, led by quarterback Bill Montgomery, challenged the Texas Longhorns for a national championship in the Game of the Century.

====Track and field====
The track and field team was under the direction of John McDonnell for over 25 years (since the 1977–78 academic year). McDonnell&#x27;s men&#x27;s teams have won 40 NCAA championships since 1984, including 11 cross country, 19 indoor track and 10 outdoor track along with 37 Southwest Conference championships, and 38 of 40 SEC titles. The Razorbacks, under his direction, won five NCAA National Triple Crowns, achieved by winning NCAA titles in cross country, indoor and outdoor track in the same school year. Arkansas and the University of Texas-El Paso (UTEP) are the only teams to have ever won the National Triple Crown. The track and field Razorbacks men completely dominated the sport during the 1990s, winning 24 of the 30 available titles. Now under the direction of coaches Chris Bucknam, Doug Case, and Travis Geopfert who headed field events before his departure in June 2024 to be the track and field/cross country director at Kansas State in Manhattan, Kansas, the men&#x27;s track and field team still dominates the NCAA. They have won multiple SEC triple crowns along with two NCAA national championships since taking over in 2008.

====Golf====
The Razorbacks golf teams are based at The Blessings golf course in Fayetteville. From the back tees of the course, the rating is 79.1 and its slope is 153, making it one of the most difficult golf courses in the U.S.

John Daly remains an avid fan of the Razorbacks even after the University of Arkansas misplaced his 1991 PGA Championship trophy that he loaned to them.

The men&#x27;s golf team has won three conference championships: 1958 Southwest Conference and 1995 and 2019 Southeastern Conference. R. H. Sikes won the NCAA Championship in 1963 and the team place second in 2009.

===Women&#x27;s sports===

====Basketball====

The Razorback women&#x27;s basketball team plays home games in Bud Walton Arena, often referred to as the &quot;Basketball Palace of Mid-America&quot;. The building is located on the University of Arkansas campus. The women&#x27;s basketball team completed its 39th season in 2014–15, and has made 21 postseason appearances (from AIAW through the current NCAA era). The Razorbacks&#x27; made their first NCAA Women&#x27;s Final Four appearance in 1998, with the help of team leader Christy Smith.

====Cross country====
The cross country track team is led by head coach Chris Johnson. They practice and compete on cross country course at the university&#x27;s Agricultural Experiment Station north of the main campus. The course is also home to the men&#x27;s cross country team. Harter is the first Arkansas coach to have his team ranked No. 1 in the nation, and has won more SEC cross country titles than any other member institution. The women&#x27;s team won its first national championship at the NCAA Women&#x27;s Division I Cross Country Championship in Terre Haute, Indiana, in November 2019. The win completed a calendar-year sweep after the university&#x27;s indoor and outdoor track and field teams won their respective championships.

====Golf====
The golf team is headed by coach Shauna Estes-Taylor. The team practices both at Blessings course, which is located a few minutes from the University of Arkansas campus in Johnson, Arkansas, and also at the Fred W. and Mary B. Smith Razorback Golf Training Facility—which is also located at Blessings course—which features both indoor and outdoor practice areas. The men&#x27;s golf team utilizes both areas as well.

====Gymnastics====
The gymnastics team is referred to as the GymBacks. They are head coached by former US Olympian Jordyn Wieber. They practice in the Bev Lewis Center for Women&#x27;s Athletics and compete in Barnhill Arena, both of which are located on the University of Arkansas campus. The Gym&#x27;Backs have five NCAA Regional appearances (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008), advanced two individuals (Dana McQuillin and Casey Jo Magee) to the NCAA Championship and hosted the 2006 NCAA South Central Regional.

At the 2006 Regionals, the Gym&#x27;Backs placed second in a six-team field, qualifying them for the NCAA National Championships for the first time. They repeated this feat in 2008.

Also in 2008, team members Michelle Stout and Casey Jo Magee, became the Gym&#x27;Backs first All-Americans. Stout reached the first-team status on vault while Magee became a two-time second-team member on vault and uneven bars.

The team is also the only team in the entire NCAA to have a coaching staff composed entirely of olympians.

====Soccer====
The soccer team is head coached by Colby Hale, and practice/play on Arkansas Field which is an exclusively soccer field on campus. Arkansas soccer is one of the oldest programs in the Southeastern Conference, competing as a varsity sport since 1986.

====Softball====
The softball team is coached by Courtney Deifel. They practice and play at Bogle Park, which opened during the 2008–09 season.

====Swimming and diving====
The swimming and diving team is coached by Neil Harper. The team&#x27;s facilities are the University of Arkansas Natatorium, which is located inside the HPER building (which also is home to student intramural facilities).

====Tennis====
The tennis team&#x27;s head coach is Michael Hegarty. The team&#x27;s facilities are the Billingsley Center (outdoor) and the adjacent Dills Indoor Tennis Center. Tennis is one of the oldest varsity sports at Arkansas with a continuous history from the first year of the Women&#x27;s Athletics Department in 1971–1972.

====Track and field====
The track and field team is coached by Chris Johnson, who began in 2023, and has won nine NCAA Division I championships since 2015, five in indoor track and field and three in outdoor track and field and one in cross country. The team also swept the 2019 calendar, winning the indoor, outdoor and cross country national championships.

The team has indoor training and racing facilities at the Randal Tyson Track Center and outdoor facilities at John McDonnell Field. The teams are the most successful in the Southeastern Conference, winning 16 league titles including the first-ever SEC women&#x27;s triple crown (a sweep of cross country, indoor and outdoor titles in the same season). His program produced numerous NCAA champions and most recently Athens Olympics medalists Veronica Campbell (two gold medals and a bronze for Jamaica in sprints) and Deena (Drossin) Kastor. Kastor is one of America&#x27;s premier distance runners, earning a marathon bronze medal in Athens and holding numerous distance and marathon records.

====Volleyball====
The volleyball team has been coached by Jason Watson since 2016. They practice and play in Barnhill Arena. Robert Pulliza was the previous coach, from 2008 to 2015. Before Pulliza took over for Chris Poole in 2008, Poole&#x27;s teams had won 11 SEC Western Division from their inaugural season in 1994.

==Notable non-varsity sports==

===Rugby===
Founded in 1971, the University of Arkansas Rugby Club is the longest-tenured sports club on campus. Arkansas plays college rugby in the Division 1 Heart of America conference, a conference composed mostly of Big 12 and SEC teams. The team plays at Walker Park, just south of the Donald W. Reynolds Stadium. Arkansas rugby is led by head coach Warren Fyfe.

Arkansas has consistently been one of the best teams in the Heart of America conference, winning the conference title in the 2009–10 and 2010–11 school years, and finishing second in 2011–12. Arkansas defeated Kansas 28–12 to reach the finals of the 2012 Heart of America 7s tournament, where they lost to Lindenwood.

===Ice Hockey===
The Razorback hockey program was founded in 2007 as a club team playing in the ACHA&#x27;s Division III. Playing their first full season in 2008–09, the Hogs posted a 6–6–0 record in the SECHC: since then, the team has yet to record a losing season, with five SECHC titles in their history. This success allowed the first team to move up to ACHA Division I in 2015–16, playing in the WCHL: a second team was added by the club that remains in DIII and the SECHC. Eventually, the teams would merge back into one, play at the Division II level, and move to the MACHA when the SECHC left ACHA for a rival sanctioning body. In 2021, the Ice Hogs reached the ACHA Division II national final but lost to Hope College. Home games are played at the Jones Center Rink in nearby Springdale and attract large crowds, reflecting the growth in popularity of hockey in Northwest Arkansas. The club&#x27;s biggest rival is Missouri State: the Razorbacks and Ice Bears play an annual home-and-away series, with great attendance at both venues.

===Cycling===
The University of Arkansas Cycling Club is one of the fastest-growing sports clubs on campus. For the past five years, Arkansas Cycling Club has hosted its annual cycling event, the Arkansas Classic, which attracts collegiate and non-collegiate cyclists from over 10 states, some from as far as Minnesota and Wisconsin. The club represents the university in the South Central Collegiate Cycling Conference (SCCCC), competing against teams from Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. Arkansas Cycling competes in most disciplines of cycling, especially Road and Mountain at the local, state, regional and national levels. For the past three years, the club has sent multiple riders to the Collegiate National Championships, which in 2017 will be hosted in Grand Junction, CO.

Cycling as a hobby and transportation option is growing rapidly in Northwest Arkansas, which has seen demand for the club to diversify. Although Arkansas Cycling Club has a well-grounded racing team, it also offers a number of great membership benefits and community-orientated group rides to those riders who are looking to enjoy the sport of cycling without the competitiveness of racing.

==Rivalries==
Through the administrations of athletic directors John Barnhill, Frank Broyles, and Jeff Long, the University of Arkansas maintained a policy of not competing against other in-state Division I schools. There are four other Division I schools in the state of Arkansas: Arkansas State University in Jonesboro, the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (athletically branded as &quot;Little Rock&quot;), University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, and the University of Central Arkansas in Conway. ASU is the only school of the three to compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision; Little Rock does not have football, while UAPB and UCA compete in the Football Championship Subdivision.

In 2021, Arkansas announced its first football game against Arkansas State would take place in 2025 at War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock.

Historically, Arkansas&#x27; most heated rivalry was with the Longhorns of the University of Texas. However, the rivalry has become much less intense since the two teams joined different conferences in the early 1990s and now meet up infrequently. Texas leads the series in football and baseball, while Arkansas holds the series lead in basketball and track &amp; field.
Another rival from the state of Texas is Texas A&amp;M. During their Southwest Conference rivalry days, the two teams played annually in all sports. In 2009, the rivalry resumed again on an annual basis, being played each year at Cowboys Stadium. The rivalry in all other sports resumed in the fall of 2012 after A&amp;M joined the SEC.

Since joining the Southeastern Conference the Razorbacks have developed a rivalry with Louisiana State University (LSU Tigers) in football. The game between these two teams usually takes place near the end of the season and has sometimes decided the SEC Western Division Championship. The winner of this game takes home the &quot;Golden Boot&quot; which is a gold trophy in the shape of the two states. Arkansas took the Golden Boot home in 2007 with a 50–48 win over the #1 ranked Tigers in Baton Rouge. This was their first time winning the trophy since 2002. Arkansas and LSU have also built a rivalry in baseball, as the two schools have been at the top of the NCAA attendance standings for the past several seasons. In 2001, despite coming into the series in last place in the SEC West, Arkansas swept a three-game series from top-ranked LSU, which won the 2000 College World Series, in Fayetteville. Since the University of Missouri has entered the Southeastern Conference, a new rivalry was created in 2014 called the Battle Line Rivalry that goes back and forth between both school in Football.

In basketball, the primary rival for the Razorbacks in the SEC is the Wildcats of the University of Kentucky. This rivalry developed in the 1990s during the coaching tenures of Rick Pitino at Kentucky and Nolan Richardson at Arkansas when both Kentucky and Arkansas were annually in competition for a national title.

In baseball, the main rivals of the Razorbacks are the LSU Tigers and the Ole Miss Rebels. In 2022, Arkansas and Ole Miss met each other in the College World Series. The Rebels won the first contest while the Razorbacks took the second, but it was Ole Miss who won the third and advanced to the National Championship. Ole Miss defeated Oklahoma to win their first national title in baseball.

==Mascots==


The live mascot for the University of Arkansas is named Tusk. He is a Russian boar that weighs in at approximately 400 pounds. Tusk currently resides on the Stokes family farm in Dardanelle, Ark., and makes a two-hour trek up to Northwest Arkansas for every Razorback football game. The current mascot, Tusk VI, is a direct descendant of Tusk I. The live mascot program at Arkansas is supported by the Tusk Fund, which is administered by the Razorback Foundation.

There are a number of costumed mascots for the University of Arkansas Razorbacks that attend most major sporting events. Big Red (aka the &quot;Fighting Razorback&quot;) is the traditional mascot for the university and represents the intimidating fighting spirit of the Razorbacks at all athletic events. Sue E., is the female hog and is famous for her costume changes and dancing ability. Pork Chop is the &quot;kid&quot; mascot. Boss Hog, a nine-foot inflatable mascot, joined the mascot family during the 1998–99 football season.

The Razorback was officially adopted as the university&#x27;s mascot in 1909 after Hugo Bezdek, the coach at the time, stated after a big win that his team played like a &quot;wild band of razorback hogs&quot;. Subsequently, the razorback became the mascot for the entire university, replacing the cardinals as the official mascot. The only current athletic logo for the university is the classic or running hog as has been depicted on the program&#x27;s football helmets. The university has ceased manufacture of memorabilia with any of the other logos in an attempt to re-brand the athletic department.

<text>Toy Story 2 is a 1999 American animated adventure comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. It is the sequel to &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995) and the second installment in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise. The film was directed by John Lasseter, co-directed by Ash Brannon and Lee Unkrich, and produced by Helene Plotkin and Karen Robert Jackson, from a screenplay written by Andrew Stanton, Rita Hsiao, Doug Chamberlin, and Chris Webb, and a story conceived by Lasseter, Stanton, Brannon, and Pete Docter. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts, R. Lee Ermey, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf and Jeff Pidgeon reprise their roles from the first film. In the film, Woody is stolen by a greedy toy collector, prompting Buzz Lightyear and his friends to save him, but Woody is then tempted by the idea of immortality in a museum.

Disney initially envisioned &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; as a direct-to-video sequel. The film began production in a building separated from Pixar, on a small scale, as most of the main Pixar staff were busy working on &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to a theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film&#x27;s quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; was compressed into nine months.

Despite production struggles, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; debuted on November 24, 1999, to a successful box office run, eventually grossing over $511 million. It received widespread acclaim from critics and audiences, with aratingon the websiteRotten Tomatoes, like its predecessor. It is considered by critics to be one of the few sequel films superior to the original and is frequently featured on lists of the greatest animated films ever made. &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; would go on to become the third-highest-grossing film of 1999, behind &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; and &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. Among its accolades, the film won Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 57th Golden Globe Awards. The film has seen multiple home media releases and a theatrical 3D re-release in 2009 as part of a double feature with the first film, 10 years after its initial release. Two sequels have been released: &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010) and &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019).

== Plot ==

Woody and Buzz Lightyear have become the co-leaders of Andy&#x27;s toys. Andy plans to take Woody to Cowboy Camp, but accidentally rips his arm. Andy&#x27;s mother places Woody on a shelf, and Woody begins to fear that Andy will throw him away. The day after Andy leaves, Woody finds Wheezy, a penguin toy with a broken squeaker who has also been shelved. After saving Wheezy from being sold at a yard sale, Woody is found and stolen by a greedy toy collector. Buzz fails to foil the theft, but finds clues identifying the collector as Al McWhiggin, the owner of the &quot;Al&#x27;s Toy Barn&quot; store. Buzz, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex, and Hamm set out to rescue Woody.

At Al&#x27;s apartment, Woody discovers that he was designed after the protagonist of &quot;Woody&#x27;s Roundup&quot;, a popular children&#x27;s Western series from the 1950s, and meets his co-star character dolls – Jessie the Cowgirl, Bullseye the Horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector. While initially delighted to meet them, Woody realizes that Al plans to sell the whole &quot;Woody&#x27;s Roundup&quot; collection to a museum abroad. He announces he will return home to Andy, dismaying the gang, as the museum will not take the collection without Woody. After Woody&#x27;s arm is repaired, he learns that Jessie was abandoned by her owner, Emily, as she grew up. Afraid that Andy might do the same to him, Woody decides to go to the museum.

Meanwhile, Buzz&#x27;s group reaches Al&#x27;s Toy Barn and searches for Woody. Buzz encounters a Utility Belt Buzz toy; assuming he is a real space ranger, Utility Belt Buzz imprisons Andy&#x27;s Buzz as an imposter. Utility Belt Buzz later meets Andy&#x27;s other toys and, assuming they are on a mission to defeat his arch-nemesis Emperor Zurg, accompanies them to Al&#x27;s apartment. Andy&#x27;s Buzz escapes and follows the gang, inadvertently releasing a toy Zurg from its box. Zurg follows Buzz, intending to destroy him.

Both Buzzes and the search party arrive at Al&#x27;s apartment, but Woody initially refuses to go home with them. Shortly after Andy&#x27;s other toys leave, Woody reconsiders and invites the &quot;Woody&#x27;s Roundup&quot; toys to join him and become Andy&#x27;s toys. While a hesitant Jessie and an enthusiastic Bullseye accept Woody&#x27;s offer, Pete refuses and blocks the others from leaving; having never been played with, he is adamant about going to the museum.

Al returns to the apartment and takes the &quot;Woody&#x27;s Roundup&quot; collection to the airport. While Utility Belt Buzz fights and reconciles with Zurg, Andy&#x27;s Buzz and the other toys pursue Al&#x27;s suitcases into the airport. After a prolonged pursuit through the airport&#x27;s baggage sorting system – during which Pete re-opens the tear in Woody&#x27;s arm – the other toys subdue Pete and teach him a lesson about playtime by placing him in a girl&#x27;s backpack; she takes him with her. They save Bullseye, but Jessie is placed on the plane. Woody, Buzz, and Bullseye work together to save her just as the plane takes off. The toys then return home to Andy&#x27;s house.

Andy returns from Cowboy Camp, plays with Jessie and Bullseye, and repairs Woody and Wheezy. Al mourns the loss of the lucrative deal with the museum on television. Woody tells Buzz that he no longer fears Andy losing interest in him, for even if it does happen, he and Buzz will be friends &quot;for infinity and beyond&quot;.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
A conversation about a sequel to &quot;Toy Story&quot; began around a month after the film&#x27;s opening in December 1995. A few days after &quot;Toy Story&quot;″s release, John Lasseter was traveling with his family and found a young boy clutching a Sheriff Woody doll at an airport. Lasseter described how the boy&#x27;s excitement to show it to his father touched him deeply. Lasseter realized that his character no longer belonged to him only, but rather it belonged to others, as well. The memory was a defining factor in the production of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, with Lasseter moved to create a great film for that child and for everyone else who loved the characters.

Ed Catmull, Lasseter, and Ralph Guggenheim visited Joe Roth, successor to recently ousted Jeffrey Katzenberg as chairman of Walt Disney Studios, shortly afterward. Roth was pleased and embraced the idea of a sequel. Disney had recently begun making direct-to-video sequels to its successful features, and Roth wanted to handle the &quot;Toy Story&quot; sequel this way, as well. Prior releases, such as 1994&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot; sequel, &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot;, had returned an estimated $100million in profits.

Initially, everything regarding &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; was uncertain: whether stars Tom Hanks and Tim Allen would be available and affordable, what the story premise would be, and even whether the film would be computer-animated at Pixar or traditionally hand-drawn at Walt Disney Feature Animation. Lasseter regarded the project as a chance to groom new directing talent, as top choices were already immersed in other projects (Andrew Stanton as co-director of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; and Pete Docter as director of what would eventually become &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;). Ash Brannon, a young animator who was previously animation director on &quot;Toy Story&quot;, was selected by Lasseter to direct after admiring his work on the first film. Brannon, a CalArts graduate, joined the &quot;Toy Story&quot; team in 1993. Disney and Pixar officially announced the sequel in a press release on March 12, 1997.

=== Story ===

Lasseter&#x27;s intention with a sequel was to respect the original &quot;Toy Story&quot; film and create that world again. The story originated with him wondering what a toy would find upsetting, how a toy would feel if it were not played with by a child or, worse, a child growing out of a toy. Brannon suggested the idea of a yard sale where the collector recognizes Woody as a rare artifact. The concept of Woody as a collectible set came from the draft story of &quot;A Tin Toy Christmas&quot;, an original half-hour special pitched by Pixar to Disney in 1990. The obsessive toy collector named Al McWhiggin, who had appeared in a draft of &quot;Toy Story&quot; but was later expunged, was inserted into the film. Lasseter claimed that Al was inspired by himself.

Secondary characters in Woody&#x27;s set were inspired by 1940s–1950s Western and puppet shows for children, such as &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;, &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot; and &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;. The development of Jessie was kindled by Lasseter&#x27;s wife Nancy, who pressed him to include a strong female character in the sequel, one with more substance than Bo Peep. The scope for the original &quot;Toy Story&quot; was basic and only extended over two residential homes, roadways, and a chain restaurant, whereas &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; has been described by Unkrich as something &quot;all over the map&quot;.

To ensure that the project was ready for theaters, Lasseter had to add around 12 minutes of material and strengthen what was already there. The extra material would be a challenge since it could not be mere paddingit would have to feel as if it had always been there, an organic part of the film. With the scheduled delivery date less than a year away, Lasseter called Stanton, Docter, Joe Ranft, and some Disney story people to his house for a weekend. There, he hosted what he called a &quot;story summit&quot;, a crash exercise that would produce a finished story in just two days.

Back at the office that Monday, Lasseter assembled the company in a screening room and pitched the revised version of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; from exposition to resolution. Story elements were recycled from the original drafts of the first &quot;Toy Story&quot; film. The first film&#x27;s original opening sequence featured a Buzz Lightyear cartoon playing on television, which evolved into the Buzz Lightyear video game that would be shown in the opening scene of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. A deleted scene from &quot;Toy Story&quot;, featuring Woody having a nightmare involving him being thrown into a trash can, was incorporated in a milder form for depicting Woody&#x27;s fear of losing Andy. The idea of a squeak-toy penguin with a broken squeaker also resurfaced from an early version of &quot;Toy Story&quot;.

=== Animation ===
As the story approached the production stage in early 1997, it was unclear whether Pixar would produce the film, as the entire team of 300 was busy working on &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; for a 1998 release. The Interactive Products Group, with a staff of 95, had its own animators, art department, and engineers. Under intense time pressure, they had put out two successful CD-ROM titles the previous year – &quot;Disney&#x27;s Animated Storybook: Toy Story&quot; and &quot;The Toy Story Activity Center&quot;. Between the two products, the group had created as much original animation as there was in &quot;Toy Story&quot; itself. Steve Jobs made the decision to shut down the computer games operation and the staff became the initial core of the &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; production team.

Before the switch from direct-to-video to feature film, the &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; crew had been on its own, placed in a new building that was well-separated from the rest of the company by railroad tracks. &quot;We were just the small film and we were off playing in our sandbox,&quot; co-producer Karen Jackson said. Lasseter looked closely at every shot that had already been animated and called for tweaks throughout. The film reused digital elements from &quot;Toy Story&quot; but, true to the company&#x27;s &quot;prevailing culture of perfectionism, [...] it reused less of &quot;Toy Story&quot; than might be expected&quot;. Character models received major upgrades internally and shaders went through revisions to bring about subtle improvements. The team freely borrowed models from other productions, such as Geri from Pixar&#x27;s 1997 short &quot;Geri&#x27;s Game&quot;, who became the Cleaner in &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. Supervising animator Glenn McQueen inspired the animators to do spectacular work in the short amount of time given, assigning different shots to suit each animators&#x27; strengths.

While producing &quot;Toy Story&quot;, the crew was careful in creating new locations, working within available technology at that time. By the time of production on &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, technology had advanced farther to allow more complicated camera shots than were possible in the first film. In making the sequel, the team at Pixar did not want to stray too far from the first film&#x27;s look, but the company had developed a lot of new software since the first feature had been completed. To achieve the dust visible after Woody is placed on top of a shelf, the crew was faced with the challenge of animating dust, an incredibly difficult task. After much experimentation, a tiny particle of dust was animated and the computer distributed that image throughout the entire shelf. Over two million dust particles are in place on the shelf in the completed film.

=== Troubled production ===

Disney became unhappy with the pace of the work on the film and demanded in June 1997 that Guggenheim be replaced as producer, and Pixar complied. As a result, associate producers Karen Jackson and Helene Plotkin were moved up into the roles of co-producers.

In November 1997, Roth and head of Walt Disney Feature Animation Peter Schneider viewed the film&#x27;s story reels, with some finished animation, in a screening room at Pixar. They were impressed with the quality of work and became interested in releasing &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; in theaters. In addition to the unexpected artistic caliber, there were other reasons that made the case for a theatrical release more compelling. The economics of a direct-to-video Pixar release were lackluster due to the higher salaries of the crew. After negotiations, Jobs and Roth agreed that the split of costs and profits for &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; would follow the model of a newly created five-film dealbut &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; would not count as one of the five films. Disney had bargained in the contract for five original features, not sequels, thus assuring five sets of new characters for its theme parks and merchandise. Jobs gathered the crew and announced the change in plans for the film on February 5, 1998.

The work done on the film to date was nearly lost in 1998 when one of the animators, while routinely clearing some files, accidentally entered the deletion command code codice_1 on the root folder of the &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; assets on Pixar&#x27;s internal servers. Associate technical director Oren Jacob was one of the first to notice as character models disappeared from their works in progress. They shut down the file servers but had already lost 90% of the last two years of work, and it was also found that the backups had not been working for about a month. The film was saved when technical director Galyn Susman, who had been remote working to take care of her newborn child, revealed she had a backup copy of the film on her home computer. The Pixar team was able to recover nearly all of the lost assets saved for a few recent days of work, allowing the film to proceed.

Many of the creative staff at Pixar were not happy with how the sequel was turning out. Upon returning from the European promotion tour of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, Lasseter watched the development reels and agreed that it was not working. Pixar met with Disney, telling them that the film would have to be redone. Disney disagreed, and noted that Pixar did not have enough time to remake the film before its established release date. Pixar decided that they simply could not allow the film to be released in its existing state, and asked Lasseter to take over the production. Lasseter agreed, recruiting the first film&#x27;s creative team, including Stanton and Docter, to redevelop the story and taking over as director from Brannon, who would remain on the project as co-director alongside Lee Unkrich, who was also fresh from &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, having served as supervising editor. To meet Disney&#x27;s deadline, Pixar had to complete the entire film in nine months. Unkrich, concerned with the dwindling amount of time remaining, asked Jobs whether the release date could be pushed back. Jobs explained that there was no choice, presumably in reference to the film&#x27;s licensees and marketing partners, who were getting toys and promotions ready.

Brannon focused on development, story and animation, Lasseter was in charge of art, modeling and lighting, and Unkrich oversaw editorial, cinematography, and layout. The three met daily to discuss their progress with each other (they wanted to ensure they were all progressing in the same direction), which caused the boundaries of their responsibilities to overlap. As was common with Pixar features, the production became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer. Still, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, with its highly compressed production schedule, was especially trying. While hard work and long hours were common to the team by that point—especially so to Lasseter—running flat-out on &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; for month after month began to take a toll. The overwork spun out into carpal tunnel syndrome for some animators, and repetitive strain injuries (RSI) for others. Catmull would later disclose that &quot;a full third of the staff&quot; ended up with some form of RSI by the time the film was finished. Pixar did not encourage long hours, and, in fact, set limits on how many hours employees could work by approving or disapproving overtime. Employees&#x27; self-imposed compulsions to excel often trumped any other constraints, and were especially common to younger employees. In one instance, an animator had forgotten to drop his child off at daycare one morning and, in a mental haze, forgot the baby in the back seat of his car in the parking lot. &quot;Although quick action by rescue workers headed off the worst, the incident became a horrible indicator that some on the crew were working too hard,&quot; wrote David Price in his 2008 book &quot;The Pixar Touch&quot;.

==Music==

Randy Newman, who composed and conducted music for the original &quot;Toy Story&quot; film, returned to score the sequel. He wrote two original songs – &quot;When She Loved Me&quot;, performed by Sarah McLachlan, and &quot;Woody&#x27;s Roundup&quot;, performed by Riders in the Sky – besides composing the score. The song from &quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend in Me&quot; was also reused. It was sung at two different points during the film by Tom Hanks as Woody and Robert Goulet, the singing voice of Wheezy. The score released by Walt Disney Records on November 9, 1999. The track &quot;When She Loved Me&quot;, which was considered to be among the saddest sequences in both Disney and Pixar films, and the saddest film songs ever written, received acclaim for McLachlan&#x27;s singing and Newman&#x27;s compositions. The song was nominated at the Academy Awards in 2000 for Best Original Song, though the award went to Phil Collins for &quot;You&#x27;ll Be in My Heart&quot; from another Disney animated film, &quot;Tarzan&quot;.

== Release ==
===Theatrical===
Pixar showed the completed film at CalArts on November 12, 1999, in recognition of the school&#x27;s ties with Lasseter and more than 40 other alumni who worked on the film. The students were captivated. The film held its official premiere the next day at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angelesthe same venue as &quot;Toy Story&quot;and was released across the United States on November 24, 1999. The film&#x27;s initial theatrical and video releases include &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot;, Pixar&#x27;s first short film released in 1986, starring Pixar&#x27;s titular mascot. Before &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot;, a disclaimer appears reading: &quot;In 1986 Pixar Animation Studios produced their first film. This is why we have a hopping lamp in our logo&quot;. On December 25, 1999, within a month of the film&#x27;s theatrical release, a blooper reel was added to the film&#x27;s mid-credits, which features the characters, Flik and Heimlich, from &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;.

=== Re-releases ===
In 2009, both &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; were converted to 3D for a two-week limited theatrical re-release, which was extended due to its success. Lasseter said, &quot;The &quot;Toy Story&quot; films and characters will always hold a very special place in our hearts and we&#x27;re so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy in a whole new way, thanks to the latest in 3-D technology. With &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz, Woody and the gang from Andy&#x27;s room, we thought it would be great to let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way&quot;.

Translating the films into 3-D involved revisiting the original computer data and virtually placing a second camera into each scene, creating left-eye and right-eye views needed to achieve the perception of depth. Unique to computer animation, Lasseter referred to this process as &quot;digital archaeology&quot;. The lead stereographer Bob Whitehill oversaw this process and sought to achieve an effect that impacted the film&#x27;s emotional storytelling. It took four months to resurrect the old data and get it in working order. Then, adding 3-D to each of the films took six months per film.

The double feature opened in 1,745 theaters on October 2, 2009, and made $12.5 million in its opening weekend, finishing in third place at the box office behind &quot;Zombieland&quot; and &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&quot;. The features closed on November 5, 2009, with a worldwide gross of $32.3 million. Unlike other countries, the UK and Argentina received the films in 3-D as separate releases. &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; was released January 22, 2010, in the UK, and February 18, 2010, in Argentina.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Toy Story 2&quot; was released on both VHS and DVD and as a DVD two-pack with &quot;Toy Story&quot; on October 17, 2000. That same day, an &quot;Ultimate Toy Box&quot; set was released containing the first and second films and a third disc of bonus materials. The standard DVD release allowed the viewer to select the version of the film either in widescreen (1.77:1 aspect ratio) or fullscreen (family-friendly 1.33:1 aspect ratio without pan and scan). A sneak peek of &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; was also attached to these releases, which were all THX certified. The standard VHS, DVD, DVD two-pack, and the &quot;Ultimate Toy Box&quot; sets returned to the vault on May 1, 2003. It was re-released as a Special Edition 2-disc DVD on December 26, 2005. Both editions returned to the Disney Vault on January 31, 2009.

A brief controversy involving the Ultimate Toy Box edition took place in which around 1,000 copies of the box set that were shipped to Costco stores had a pressing error which caused a scene from the 2000 R-rated film &quot;High Fidelity&quot; to play in the middle of the film. The scene in question, which featured the use of the word &quot;fuck&quot; multiple times, prompted a number of complaints from consumers, causing Costco to eventually recall the defective units from shelves and later go on to replace them. The defect was caused by a &quot;content mix&quot; error according to Technicolor, which manufactured the discs, and only affected the U.T.B. Box set copies of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; which were included with the two-pack were not affected by the manufacturing error. According to Buena Vista Home Entertainment, less than 1% of the discs shipped were printed with the glitch.

&quot;Toy Story 2&quot; was available for the first time on Blu-ray Disc in a Special Edition Combo Pack released on March 23, 2010, along with the first film. On November 1, 2011, the first three &quot;Toy Story&quot; films were re-released, each as a DVD/Blu-ray/Blu-ray 3D/Digital Copy combo pack (four discs each for the first two films, and five for the third film). The film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on June 4, 2019.

====Deleted outtake====
For the 2019 home media, the Disney+ reissue, and the 2024 UK theatrical cinema re-release at Vue Cinemas, Disney removed a scene from the film&#x27;s mid-credit outtakes that featured Stinky Pete flirting with a pair of Barbie dolls and discussing a role in &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;. Media outlets inferred the outtake to be a reference to the casting couch practice and attributed the change to being a result of the Me Too movement, which included director John Lasseter stepping down from Pixar the previous year following allegations of sexual misconduct towards employees at the studio. Kelsey Grammer, voice of Stinky Pete, later explained his and Lasseter&#x27;s intention behind the outtake, that being &quot;[...] the Barbies might be in his trailer, talking about how he’d like to get them some work, but he’s actually trying to hit on them.&quot; When told Disney was removing it due to the Me Too movement, he asked, “But why? Because, what, they’re guilty of it?”, then added in an interview, &quot;But they cut it out anyway. It was fairly harmless. It just was, &#x27;Oh, yeah, that never happened in Hollywood&#x27;...Well, all right...&quot;

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Toy Story 2&quot; was as successful as the first &quot;Toy Story&quot; film commercially. It became 1999&#x27;s highest-grossing animated film, earning $245.9million in the United States and Canada and $511.3million worldwidebeating both Pixar&#x27;s previous releases by a significant margin. It became the third-highest-grossing animated film of all time (behind &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;Aladdin&quot;).

&quot;Toy Story 2&quot; opened over the Thanksgiving Day weekend at No. 1 ahead of &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, &quot;End of Days&quot; and &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, collecting a three-day tally of $57.4 million from 3,236 theaters, averaging $17,734 per theater over three days, as well as making $80.1 million since its Wednesday launch and staying at the top for the next two weekends. At the time of the film&#x27;s release, it had the third-highest opening weekend of all time, behind &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. It also broke the studio record for having the best single-day gross, surpassing &quot;The Waterboy&quot;. When the film opened, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; earned $9.5 million during its first day, breaking &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;″s record to have the highest Thanksgiving opening day. On its third day of release, the film made $22.6 million, becoming the highest Friday gross at that time, beating &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. For two years, it would hold this record until May 2001 when &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; opened with $23.4 million. The film also had the largest opening weekend for an animated film before being surpassed by &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; that year. Moreover, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; was ranked as the third-highest five-day Wednesday gross of any film, trailing only behind &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; and &quot;Independence Day&quot;. The film even had the highest five-day Thanksgiving opening weekend, beating out &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. In 2013, &quot;The Hunger Games: Catching Fire&quot; and &quot;Frozen&quot; both surpassed &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; to have the largest Thanksgiving weekend debut. For its second weekend, the film had earned $27.7 million, making it the fourth-highest December weekend gross, after &quot;Scream 2&quot;″s opening weekend gross and &quot;Titanic&quot;″s opening weekend and second weekend grosses respectively. By New Year&#x27;s Day, it had made more than $200million in the U.S. alone, and it eventually became 1999&#x27;s third highest-grossing film after &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; and &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, while also far surpassing the original. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 47.8million tickets in the United States and Canada.

The film set a three-day weekend record in the United Kingdom, grossing £7.7 million and beating &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. In 2001, that record would be surpassed by &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. It spent seven weeks there at number one. In Japan, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; earned $3.8 million in its opening weekend to not only become the country&#x27;s highest-grossing American animated film, but also the second largest opening weekend in the territory, behind &quot;Armageddon&quot;. Around this time, the film surpassed &quot;Twister&quot; to become the seventeenth-highest domestic grosser. Following in biggest grosses are Italy ($6.9million), France and the Maghreb region ($24.7million), Germany ($12.9million), and Spain ($11.7million).

=== Critical response ===
Reviewers judged &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; as a sequel that equaled or even surpassed the original in terms of quality. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; proclaimed:
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;The rare sequel that arguably improves on its predecessor, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; uses inventive storytelling, gorgeous animation, and a talented cast to deliver another rich moviegoing experience for all ages.&quot; As of March 2024, it is the highest rated animated film on the site and the second best rated film overall, after &quot;Leave No Trace&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 88 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. CinemaScore reported that audiences had given the film a rare average grade of &quot;A+&quot; on an A+ to F scale, making it the first ever computer-animated film to receive this grade.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four and said in his print review &quot;I forgot something about toys a long time ago, and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; reminded me&quot;. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said &quot;&quot;Toy Story 2&quot; may not have the most original title, but everything else about it is, well, mint in the box&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;In the realm of sequels, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; is to &quot;Toy Story&quot; what &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was to its predecessor, a richer, more satisfying film in every respect&quot;. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said &quot;It&#x27;s a great, IQ-flattering entertainment both wonderful and wise&quot;.

Upon seeing the film, animator Chuck Jones (director of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts) wrote a letter to Lasseter, calling the film &quot;wonderful&quot; and &quot;beautifully animated&quot;, and telling Lasseter he was &quot;advancing the cause of classic animation in a new and effective way.&quot; Lasseter, a personal admirer of Jones, has the letter framed in his house.

<text>Babylas of Antioch (, from ; ; died 253) was a Syrian patriarch of Antioch (237–253), who died in prison during the Decian persecution. In the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches of the Byzantine rite his feast day is 4 September, in the Roman Rite, 24 January. He has the distinction of being the first saint recorded as having had his remains moved or &quot;translated&quot; for religious purposes; a practice that was to become extremely common in later centuries.

== Life ==
Babylas was the successor of Zebinnus as Bishop of Antioch in the reign of the Emperor Gordian III (238–244), being the twelfth bishop of the see. During the Decian persecution (250) he made an unwavering confession of faith and was thrown into prison where he died from his sufferings. He was, therefore, venerated as a martyr.

John Chrysostom&#x27;s homily upon Babylas and the &quot;Acts of the Martyrs&quot; report the following story, that Babylas once refused the visiting pagan emperor, on account of his sinful ways, permission to enter the church and had ordered him to take his place among the penitents. John does not give the name of the emperor; the &quot;Acts&quot; mention Numerian. It is more likely the contemporary Philip the Arab of whom Eusebius (&quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot;, VI, 34) reports that a bishop would not let him enter the gathering of Christians at the Easter vigil. Later legend elaborates on this, stating that Babylas demanded that he do penance for his part in the murder of the young Gordian III before he would allow Philip to celebrate Easter.

== Veneration ==
In 351 the Caesar Constantius Gallus built a new church in honor of Babylas at Daphne, a suburb of Antioch, and had the remains of the bishop transferred to it. The intention of Gallus in translating the remains of Babylas to Daphne was to neutralize the pagan effects of the temple of Apollo located there, or, as Chrysostom expresses it, to &quot;bring a physician to the sick&quot;.

According to Chrysostom, when Emperor Julian consulted the oracle of Apollo at the temple in Daphne (362), he received no answer and was told that it was because of the proximity of Babylas. He therefore, had the sarcophagus of the martyr exhumed and taken back to his original place of burial. A few days later, on October 22, a mysterious fire broke out in the temple of Apollo, consuming the roof of the building, and the statue of the god, copied from Phidias&#x27; statue of Zeus at Olympia. Julian, suspecting angry Christians were responsible, ordered the cathedral of Antioch closed, and an investigation into the cause of the fire: Ammianus Marcellinus reports &quot;a frivolous rumor&quot; laid the blame to some candles lit by a worshipper late the previous night (XXII, 13). John Chrysostom claimed a bolt of lightning set the temple on fire. The remains of Babylas were reinterred in a church dedicated to him on the other side of the River Orontes. Near the close of his discourse, John Chrysostom refers to the erection of the church dedicated to Babylas, and to the zeal of the Bishop Meletius in promoting it, who actually took part in the work with his own hands.

This was the first recorded &quot;translation&quot; of the buried remains of a saint, something that was to become routine in the Middle Ages.

The columns and walls of the ruined temple were still pointed out twenty years later. In the Middle Ages, the remains of Babylas are said to have been moved to Cremona.

The Glenlivet distillery has grown in the post-war period to become one of the biggest single malt distilleries. The Glenlivet brand is the biggest selling single malt whisky in the United States and the second biggest selling single malt brand globally after Glenfiddich.

Today, the distillery is owned by the Chivas Brothers subsidiary of the French alcoholic beverages company Pernod Ricard, which also oversees the distillery&#x27;s production of 5,900,000 proof litres per annum. The majority of this – enough for 6 million bottles – is sold as &quot;The Glenlivet&quot; single malt, with the remainder being used in Pernod Ricard&#x27;s blended whisky brands.

== History ==
Illicit distilleries were commonplace throughout the Speyside area from 1700s but were largely made redundant with the passing of the Excise Act in 1823. It was under this legislation that legal distilleries could be formed, subject to holding a license. Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, was allegedly instrumental in the passing of this legislation. Although there is no historical record of his involvement in the issue, his tenant, George Smith, who was operating an illicit distillery on his Upper Drummin farm at the time, became the first person in Scotland to apply for and receive a license to legally produce spirit.

George Smith&#x27;s decision would prove to be an unpopular decision; every other distiller was operating illegally at the time and hoping the new Excise Act would be repealed, something which would not happen if some distillers accepted the new law. Threats were made against Smith, so Gordon provided Smith with two pistols to be used to ensure both his own safety and that of the distillery. In 1824, The Glenlivet distillery was established at Upper Drumin by George Smith and his youngest son John Gordon Smith.

George Smith established a second distillery during 1849, named the &quot;Cairngorm-Delnabo Distillery&quot; but by 1855 or 1856, both distilleries were running at full capacity, and were unable to meet rising demand. The operation of two separate sites was also proving difficult and expensive, so plans were formed around the same time to build a new, larger distillery further down the hill at Minmore. Construction of this new distillery was underway when the old Upper Drumin distillery was destroyed by fire during 1858. Construction of the new Minmore distillery was speeded up and salvageable equipment from the Upper Drumin distillery was transferred to the new Minmore distillery. The Delnabo distillery was closed at the same time and the best parts of the equipment were also transferred to the Minmore plant. Production commenced at the new plant during 1859 and it was around the same time the legal entity of &quot;George &amp; J.G. Smith, Ltd.&quot; was formed.

George Smith died in 1871 and his son John Gordon Smith inherited the distillery. The quality of the product from their distillery had resulted in the other distilleries in the area renaming their products &quot;Glenlivet&quot; and by the time of George&#x27;s death, several distillers were doing so. J.G. Smith decided to take legal action and tried to claim ownership on &quot;The Glenlivet&quot; name, this legal action was only partially successful - the verdict forced other distillers in the area to stop calling their whisky &quot;Glenlivet&quot; and gave J.G. Smith and the blender Andrew Usher sole permission to use the brand, but permitted other distilleries to hyphenate their distillery name with the &quot;Glenlivet&quot; name, which resulted in new distillery names such as &quot;The Glen Moray-Glenlivet Distillery&quot;, a distillery which is situated nearby.

The distillery remained open throughout the Great Depression, an event which affected many other distilleries; it wasn&#x27;t until the Second World War that the distillery was mothballed for the first time, by Government decree. In the aftermath of World War Two, Britain was heavily indebted and needed to export large quantities of goods to earn foreign revenue (mainly United States dollars). Distilling was an ideal industry with whisky much in demand overseas. Distilling restrictions were rapidly lifted and output from the distillery was at pre-war levels by 1947, despite ongoing barley, fuel, and manpower limitations. Bread rationing was retained until 1948 in order to ensure supplies of grain for the distilleries.

Glenlivet Distillery (&quot;George &amp; J.G. Smith, Ltd.&quot;) merged with the Glen Grant Distillery (&quot;J. &amp; J. Grant Glen Grant, Ltd.&quot;) in 1953 to form &quot;The Glenlivet and Glen Grant Distillers, Ltd.&quot;. The company would go on to merge with &quot;Hill Thomson &amp; Co., Ltd.&quot; and &quot;Longmorn-Glenlivet Distilleries, Ltd.&quot; in 1970 before changing their name to &quot;Glenlivet Distillers Ltd&quot; in 1972. 

The company was then purchased by Canadian drinks and media company Seagram in 1977. Seagram&#x27;s alcohol production interests were acquired by Pernod Ricard and Diageo during 2000, with ownership of Glenlivet Distillers passing to Pernod Ricard. While Glen Grant Distillery was sold to Campari Group in 2005 Pernod Ricard kept control over the Glenlivet and Aberlour single malt whisky brands.In 2007, The Glenlivet was the best selling malt whisky in the United States, and the fourth best selling in the UK with a 7% market share. The Glenlivet is the world&#x27;s second best selling single malt whisky, and current global sales total 6 million bottles per annum. The distillery became a major stop on the Scotland&#x27;s Malt Whisky Trail of seven working Speyside single malt distilleries in the Strathspey, Scotland region. During the Glenlivet tour (after paying a fee), visitors can sample three of the products.

In May 2021, barley seeds from the distillery traveled to the International Space Station aboard a Space X Rocket to test the extreme conditions of outer space. The seeds will be planted and distilled into a single malt.

== Production ==
The distillery draws water from Josie&#x27;s Well and other springs a short distance from the distillery. The malt comes from Crisp Maltings, Portgordon. Glenlivet&#x27;s stills are lantern shaped with long, narrow necks, all of which help to produce a light-tasting spirit.

The distillery has 7 wash stills each with a capacity of 15,000 litres and 7 spirit stills with a capacity of 10,000 litres. The spirit is then matured in oak casks.

Glenlivet is categorised as a Speyside distillery. As of 2016, The Glenlivet range consists of 14 whiskies.

The main product range from the distillery is &quot;The Glenlivet&quot; range of single malt scotch whisky, but whisky from the distillery is also used in the production of Pernod Ricard&#x27;s other brands, including &quot;Chivas Regal&quot; and &quot;Royal Salute&quot; whisky brands.

Bottling of The Glenlivet took place at a Chivas Brothers bottling plant at Newbridge just outside Edinburgh, but that plant was sold at the end of 2009 with bottling to be transferred to other Chivas Brothers plants.

In 2008, The Glenlivet announced expansion plans for the distillery to keep up with increased demand. This includes the installation of a new mash tun, new stills and new washbacks. The expansion cost the equivalent of US$15 million and significantly increased capacity. The new extension with an additional mashtun, eight washbacks and 6 stills was opened by the Prince of Wales on 5 June 2010. The capacity of the distillery has been increased by 75% The company broke ground on another expansion in September 2015.

<text>Ernő Rubik (; born 13 July 1944) is a Hungarian architect and inventor, widely known for creating the Rubik&#x27;s Cube (1974), Rubik&#x27;s Magic, and Rubik&#x27;s Snake.

While Rubik became famous for inventing the Rubik&#x27;s Cube and his other puzzles, much of his recent work involves the promotion of science in education. Rubik is involved with several organizations such as Beyond Rubik&#x27;s Cube, the Rubik Learning Initiative and the Judit Polgar Foundation, all of which aim to engage students in science, mathematics, and problem solving at a young age.

Rubik studied sculpture at the Academy of Applied Arts and Design in Budapest and architecture at the Technical University, also in Budapest. While a professor of design at the academy, he pursued his hobby of building geometric models. One of these was a prototype of his cube, made of 27 wooden blocks; it took Rubik a month to solve the problem of the cube. It proved a useful tool for teaching algebraic group theory, and in late 1977 Konsumex, Hungary&#x27;s state trading company, began marketing it. By 1980, Rubik&#x27;s Cube was marketed throughout the world, and over 100 million authorized units, with an estimated 50 million unauthorized imitations, were sold, mostly during its subsequent three years of popularity. Approximately 50 books were published describing how to solve the puzzle of Rubik&#x27;s Cube. Following his cube&#x27;s popularity, Rubik opened a studio to develop designs in 1984; among its products was another popular puzzle toy, Rubik&#x27;s Magic.

==Early life and education==
Ernő Rubik was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 13 July 1944, during World War II, and has lived all of his life in Hungary. His father, who was also named Ernő Rubik, was a flight engineer at the Esztergom aircraft factory, and his mother, Magdolna Szántó, was a poet. He has stated in almost every interview that he got his inspiration from his father.

His father, Ernő, was a highly respected engineer of gliders. His extensive work and expertise in this area gained him an international reputation as an expert in his field. Ernő Rubik has stated that:

From 1958 to 1962, Rubik specialized in sculpture at the Secondary School of Fine and Applied Arts. From 1962 to 1967, Rubik attended the Budapest University of Technology where he became a member of the Architecture Faculty. From 1967 to 1971, Rubik attended the Hungarian Academy of Applied Arts and Design and was in the Faculty of Interior Architecture and Design.

Rubik considers university and the education it afforded him as the decisive event which shaped his life. Rubik stated, &quot;Schools offered me the opportunity to acquire knowledge of subjects or rather crafts that need a lot of practice, persistence, and diligence with the direction of a mentor.&quot;

==Career==

===Professorship and origin of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube===

From 1971 to 1979, Rubik was a professor of architecture at the Budapest College of Applied Arts (&quot;Iparművészeti Főiskola&quot;). It was during his time there that he built designs for a three-dimensional puzzle and completed the first working prototype of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube in 1974, applying for a patent on the puzzle in 1975. In an interview with CNN, Rubik stated that he was &quot;searching to find a good task for my students.&quot;

Starting with blocks of wood and rubber bands, Rubik set out to create a structure that would allow the individual pieces to move without the whole structure falling apart. Rubik originally used wood for the block because of the convenience of a workshop at the university and because he viewed wood as a simple material to work with that did not require sophisticated machinery. Rubik made the original prototypes of his cube by hand, cutting the wood, boring the holes and using elastic bands to hold the contraption together.

Rubik showed his prototype to his class and his students liked it very much. Rubik realized that because of the cube&#x27;s simple structure, it could be manufactured relatively easily and might have appeal to a larger audience. Rubik&#x27;s father possessed several patents, so Rubik was familiar with the process and applied for a patent for his invention. Rubik then set out to find a manufacturer in Hungary, but had great difficulty due to the rigid planned economy of communist Hungary at the time. Eventually, Rubik was able to find a small company that worked with plastic and made chess pieces. The cube was originally known in Hungary as the Magic Cube.

Rubik licensed the Magic Cube to Ideal Toys, a U.S. company, in 1979. Ideal rebranded The Magic Cube to the Rubik&#x27;s Cube before its introduction to an international audience in 1980. The process from early prototype to mass production of the Cube had taken over six years. The Rubik&#x27;s Cube became an instant success worldwide, won several Toy of the Year awards, and became a staple of 1980s popular culture. To date, over 350 million Rubik&#x27;s Cubes have been sold, making it one of the best selling toys of all time. There are many sizes from 2x2 to 21x21.

===Other inventions===
In addition to Rubik&#x27;s Cube, Rubik is also the inventor of Rubik&#x27;s Magic, Rubik&#x27;s Snake and Rubik&#x27;s 360 among others.

===Later career and other works===
In the early 1980s, he became the editor of a game and puzzle journal called &quot;..És játék&quot; (&quot;...And games&quot;), then became self-employed in 1983, founding the Rubik Stúdió, where he designed furniture and games. In 1987, he became a professor with full tenure; in 1990, he became the president of the Hungarian Engineering Academy (&quot;Magyar Mérnöki Akadémia&quot;). At the academy, he created the International Rubik Foundation to support especially talented young engineers and industrial designers.

He attended the 2007 World Speedcubing Championship in Budapest. He also gave a lecture and autograph session at the &quot;Bridges-Pecs&quot; conference (&quot;Bridges between Mathematics and the Arts&quot;) in July 2010.

In 2009, he was appointed as an honorary professor of Keimyung University, Daegu, South Korea.

In the 2010s, Rubik has recently spent much of his time working on &quot;Beyond Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;, a Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM fields) based exhibition, which would travel the globe over the next six years. The grand opening of the exhibit was held on 26 April 2014 at the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey. At the exhibition, Rubik gave several lectures, tours, and engaged with the public and several members of the speedcubing crowd in attendance, including Anthony Michael Brooks, a world-class speedcuber.

Rubik is a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s advisory board.

==Influences==
Ernő Rubik has listed several individuals who, as he has said, &quot;exerted a great influence over me through their work.&quot; These include Leonardo da Vinci, whom Rubik regards as the Renaissance man; Michelangelo, whom he respects as a polymath, painter, and sculptor; and artist M. C. Escher, who drew impossible constructions and grappled with explorations of infinity. As regards to philosophers and writers, Rubik admires Voltaire, Stendhal, Thomas Mann, Jean-Paul Sartre, Hungarian poet Attila József, Jules Verne, and Isaac Asimov. In the field of architecture, Rubik is an admirer of Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier.

==Personal life==
Rubik describes himself as a lifelong bibliophile, saying &quot;books offered me the possibility of gaining knowledge of the world, nature and people.&quot; He has a special interest in science fiction. As well, he is fond of nature walks, sports, sailing on Lake Balaton — and gardening, saying &quot;collecting succulents is my favourite pastime.&quot;

<text>The Independence Bowl is a post-season National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)-sanctioned Division I college football bowl game that is played annually each December at Independence Stadium in Shreveport, Louisiana. The Independence Bowl was named because it was inaugurated in 1976, the year of the United States Bicentennial. The bowl&#x27;s current title sponsor is Radiance Technologies, per an agreement announced for the 2020–2025 editions. Only one prior edition of the bowl, in 2013, has not used Independence Bowl branding.

The 2020 edition of the bowl was canceled on December 20, 2020, due to an insufficient number of teams being available to fill all 2020-21 bowl games, following a season impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Conference tie-ins==
For its first five years, the game pitted the champion of the Southland Conference against an at-large opponent. It then moved to inviting two at-large teams, until 1995 when it began featuring a Southeastern Conference (SEC) school against an at-large opponent.

From 1998 to 2009, the game normally featured a matchup between teams representing the Big 12 Conference and the SEC. Teams from other conferences were included only if one of those leagues did not have enough bowl-eligible teams to fill its spot, such as in 2004 when Miami (Ohio) played instead of an SEC squad. In 2008, neither the SEC nor the Big 12 had enough bowl-eligible teams to fill their respective spots resulting in a matchup of Louisiana Tech of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) and Northern Illinois of the Mid-American Conference (MAC).

In 2010 and 2011, the Independence Bowl held the third selection from the Mountain West Conference and the seventh selection from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). It was announced that in 2012, the Mountain West Conference team would be replaced by the 10th selection from the SEC.

The bowl has multiple conference and team tie-ins for the 2020 through 2025 seasons. Both the SEC and ACC announced bowl lineups for those years that did not include the Independence Bowl. In January 2020, the bowl announced a six-year sequence of games that will feature an independent program (either Army or BYU) against a team from either the Pac-12, Conference USA (C-USA), or the American Athletic Conference (The American). Once BYU joined the Big 12 in 2023, the bowl announced that a bid to the Big 12 overall would replace BYU in their upcoming schedule rotation.

Even though ten of the Pac-12 teams departed that conference beginning with the 2024 season, it was announced that the remaining two teams, or the ten &quot;legacy teams&quot; (those leaving the conference), would fulfill the Pac-12&#x27;s obligation for the 2024 Independence Bowl.

==Notable games==
One of the most memorable games in Independence Bowl history was the 2000 edition, the &quot;snow bowl&quot; game between Texas A&amp;M and Mississippi State. The game was originally publicized as a reunion game, since Mississippi State coach Jackie Sherrill had served as A&amp;M&#x27;s coach for seven seasons in the 1980s and led them to three conference titles. However, the weather quickly dominated the storyline as a rare and significant snowstorm hit Shreveport. In the midst of the snow, Mississippi State rallied to an overtime win over A&amp;M.

The bowl has intermittently hosted ranked teams; the first (and to date, only) matchup between ranked opponents (per the AP Poll) was the 1993 edition between No. 22 Virginia Tech and No. 21 Indiana. The highest ranked team to appear was No. 12 BYU in the 2021 edition.

The only tie game in Independence Bowl history was the 1990 edition, between Louisiana Tech and Maryland. The only overtime game has been the aforementioned 2000 edition, between Texas A&amp;M and Mississippi State.

The 2015 edition set a college football bowl record with 76 points scored in one half, occurring in the first half between Tulsa and Virginia Tech.

In 2020, the Independence Bowl issued the first invitation of the bowl season, to Army, in late October. However, the game was ultimately canceled, when organizers were left without an opponent for Army, as there were insufficient teams available to fill all bowl slots. Army was later placed in the Liberty Bowl.

The 2024 edition was originally set to feature Marshall and Army. However, Marshall withdrew from the contest after a number of its players entered the NCAA transfer portal. Louisiana Tech was named as a replacement, and Marshall was later fined $100,000 by their conference for opting out of the bowl.

==Title sponsor==
In 1990, the contest became one of the earliest college bowl games to use a title sponsor, becoming the Poulan Weed-Eater Independence Bowl. Poulan (then a division of AB Electrolux Home Products, now Husqvarna AB) sponsored the game through the 1997 edition. Newell Rubbermaid&#x27;s Sanford brand of writing products took over sponsorship from 1998 until 2000, while MainStay Investments sponsored from 2001 to 2003. In January 2005, the Deja Vu chain of &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s clubs&quot; offered to become the title sponsor. The offer was rejected.

The Independence Bowl&#x27;s three-year search for a title sponsor ended on August 21, 2006, when PetroSun Inc., a Phoenix, Arizona-based company that provides services and products to suppliers of oil and gas, agreed to become the bowl&#x27;s sponsor. The deal, changing the game&#x27;s full name to the PetroSun Independence Bowl, was to have run through 2008 with an option for 2009; however the deal was discontinued prior to the 2008 game.

On May 21, 2009, AdvoCare became the fifth title sponsor since the bowl&#x27;s inception. The bowl was then renamed the AdvoCare V100 Independence Bowl. AdvoCare makes energy drinks and nutritional supplements sold through multilevel marketing. On February 28, 2013, AdvoCare and the Independence Bowl Foundation announced that the Independence Bowl name would be dropped, and the bowl would be known as the AdvoCare V100 Bowl for the 2013 game. In August 2013, AdvoCare announced it would drop its sponsorship after the 2013 game.

In February 2014, Duck Commander (a duck call and hunting apparel manufacturer founded by former Louisiana Tech quarterback Phil Robertson, made prominent by the reality series &quot;Duck Dynasty&quot;) announced that it would be the title sponsor for the 2014 bowl, known as the Duck Commander Independence Bowl. After a year, Duck Commander declined to renew sponsorship, and in July 2015, Camping World was announced as the new title sponsor of the game; Camping World Independence Bowl was the branding of the 2015 and 2016 games. On March 14, 2017, the Independence Bowl Foundation unveiled a new logo for the game, used until a new title sponsor was signed. On October 5, 2017, Walk-On&#x27;s Bistreaux &amp; Bar was named as the new title sponsor of the game; Walk-On&#x27;s Independence Bowl branding was used for the 2017 through 2019 games. On August 8, 2019, Walk On&#x27;s announced that it would end its sponsorship after the 2019 edition. On April 28, 2020, Radiance Technologies was announced as the new title sponsor, with the bowl officially named as the Radiance Technologies Independence Bowl.

==Independence Stadium==

Independence Stadium is a stadium owned by the city of Shreveport, Louisiana. It used to be known as &quot;State Fair Stadium&quot;; it is the site of the annual Independence Bowl post-season college football game, initially (1976) the &quot;Bicentennial Bowl&quot;. Before that, it was the home venue of the Shreveport Steamer of the short-lived World Football League (1974–75). It also served as a neutral site for the annual Arkansas–LSU football rivalry from 1925 to 1936. The stadium is also host to numerous high school football games and soccer matches, since many schools in Shreveport lack an on-campus facility. Independence Stadium also hosted the Louisiana High School Athletic Association state football championship games in 2005 after the Louisiana Superdome suffered heavy damage from Hurricane Katrina. In 1994–95, Independence Stadium was home to the Shreveport Pirates of the Canadian Football League, which was undergoing US expansion at the time. In the late 1990s, the stadium capacity was expanded from approximately 40,000 to 50,832. In 2005, to meet accommodations of the upcoming Independence Bowl in 2006, the stadium went through a renovation to extend the capacity from 52,000 to 59,000. Then in 2008, the City of Shreveport created an entire new section of the stadium. This portion would allow the stadium capacity to be expanded only if need be. This expanse put the total capacity at 63,000. This was part of a grander upgrading plan that improved all aspects of the facility, from concourses to playing surface.

Independence Stadium was considered as a possible playing site for the New Orleans Saints during the 2005 National Football League season due to Hurricane Katrina, but Shreveport eventually lost out to the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, and Louisiana State University&#x27;s Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge. However, Independence Stadium eventually was chosen to host the Saints&#x27; first preseason home game for the 2006 season while the Louisiana Superdome prepared for its grand re-opening. Field Turf was installed on the stadium&#x27;s playing surface in 2010. In 2010, a Texas UIL playoff game was played featuring Mesquite Horn HS and the technical host Longview. Longview won, 28–14. In 2011, Independence Stadium hosted the Port City Classic, an NCAA college football competition between Louisiana Tech University of Ruston, Louisiana, and Grambling State University of Grambling, Louisiana. The south end zone of the stadium borders Interstate 20.

<text>The Sun Bowl is a college football bowl game that has been played since 1935 in the southwestern United States at El Paso, Texas. Along with the Sugar Bowl and Orange Bowl, it is the second-oldest bowl game in the country, behind the Rose Bowl. Usually held near the end of December, games are played at the Sun Bowl stadium on the campus of the University of Texas at El Paso. Since 2011, it has featured teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and the Pac-12 Conference. This arrangement will continue through the 2025 season, with either Pac-12 schools, or Pac-12 &quot;legacy schools&quot; (the 10 schools that have left the conference in 2024 for the Big Ten, Big 12, and ACC) fulfilling previous Pac-12 bowl obligations for the next two seasons.

From 2019 to 2022, the game was sponsored by Kellogg&#x27;s; when Kellogg&#x27;s spun off its North American cereal division in October 2023, the sponsorship transferred to WK Kellogg Co. The game is officially known as the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl, after the mascot for Kellogg&#x27;s Frosted Flakes cereal. Previous sponsors include John Hancock Financial, Norwest Corporation, Wells Fargo, Helen of Troy Limited (using its Vitalis and Brut brands) and Hyundai Motor Company.

==History==
The first Sun Bowl was the 1935 edition, played on New Year&#x27;s Day between Texas high school teams; the 1936 edition, played one year later, was the first Sun Bowl contested between college teams. In most of its early history, the game pitted the champion of the Border Conference against an at-large opponent. The first three editions were played at El Paso High School stadium (1935–1937), then switched to Kidd Field until the present stadium was ready in 1963. Through the 1957 season, the game was played on January 1 or January 2; since then, with the exception of the 1976 season, the game has been played in late December, with a majority of games played on or near New Year&#x27;s Eve and on several occasions played on or after Christmas Day (1982, 1986 &amp; 1987 on Christmas Day) as well as on or before Christmas Eve.

===Notable games===
The 1940 game set the record for fewest points scored, when the Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe Bulldogs played the Catholic University Cardinals to a scoreless tie, the only 0–0 result in Sun Bowl history.

In advance of the 1949 game, Lafayette College turned down an invitation from the Sun Bowl Committee because the committee would not allow an African American player to participate. This bid rejection led to a large student demonstration on the Lafayette campus and in the city of Easton, Pennsylvania, against segregation.
Due to a freak snowstorm before the 1974 game, followed by warming temperatures as the sun created a rising steam from the field during the first half, the game was nicknamed the &quot;Fog Bowl.&quot;

The 1992 game was the final head coaching appearance of 2001 College Football Hall of Fame inductee Grant Teaff of Baylor; his Bears won over Arizona.

The 1994 game was voted the greatest Sun Bowl ever played, and included four touchdowns by Priest Holmes, as Texas defeated North Carolina, 35–31.

The 2005 game set the record for most points scored (88), as UCLA defeated Northwestern, 50–38.

The 2011 game is the only Sun Bowl decided in overtime (the NCAA started the use of overtime in Division I bowl games in 1995); Utah defeated Georgia Tech, 30–27.

The 2020 edition of the bowl was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On December 26, 2021, the Miami Hurricanes announced they would not be able to play in the 2021 edition due to COVID-19 issues so organizers stated they would try to secure a replacement team to face the Washington State Cougars. The following day, the Central Michigan Chippewas were named as the Sun Bowl replacement team. The Chippewas had originally been scheduled to face the Boise State Broncos in the Arizona Bowl, until Boise State withdrew from that bowl due to COVID-19 issues.

==Sponsorship==

The bowl&#x27;s first title sponsor was John Hancock Financial, who entered a three-year, $1.5 million partnership in June 1986. This came at a time that corporate sponsorship was not common for bowl games, and followed the Fiesta Bowl entering a sponsorship agreement that had made its January 1986 edition the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl. In March 1989, with Sun Bowl organizers and John Hancock Financial negotiating a renewal of the sponsorship agreement, it was reported that an extension might involve renaming the bowl. That came to pass in June 1989, with the annual game changing its name to John Hancock Bowl. Cited as the reason for the change was that, under the prior agreement, the sponsor&#x27;s name &quot;wasn&#x27;t mentioned enough in national media to justify the expense.&quot; Even after the formal name change, some newspapers continued to refer to it as the Sun Bowl. Five editions of the game were staged as the John Hancock Bowl, from 1989 through 1993. After the 1993 playing, John Hancock Financial reduced its support of the bowl game, to dedicate more of its promotional budget to the 1996 Summer Olympics. The name reverted to Sun Bowl, and to ensure the game would continue, the El Paso city council allocated $600,000 to cover expenses in case of a shortfall.

Subsequent title sponsorship came from Norwest Corporation (1996–1998), which then merged into Wells Fargo (1999–2003), El Pasobased Helen of Troy Limited—using its brand names of Vitalis (2004–2005) and Brut (2006–2009)—and Hyundai Motor Company (2010–2018). In August 2019, it was announced that Kellogg&#x27;s had been named the new title sponsor, and that the game would be branded as the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl—referencing Tony the Tiger, the mascot of the company&#x27;s cereal brand Frosted Flakes. A tradition begun during the Helen of Troy sponsorship is that gift packages given to players include a Sun Bowl-branded hair dryer, as Helen of Troy is a major manufacturer of that product.

==Conference tie-ins==

Starting with the 2011 edition, the bowl has been contested between teams from the Pac-12 Conference and Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).

The Sun Bowl is part of the ACC&#x27;s pool arrangement where the Duke&#x27;s Mayo (formerly Belk), Pinstripe, Music City, and Gator bowls each share choice of the conference&#x27;s eligible teams following the College Football Playoff (CFP) and the Pop-Tarts Bowl (formerly known by several other names). The Sun Bowl can take any team ranked fourth through eighth in the ACC.

The Pac-12 currently employs the Sun Bowl as its fifth choice, behind the CFP and the Alamo Bowl and Holiday Bowl.

==Game results==
Three editions of the bowl ended in a tie—1936, 1940, and 1985—they are &quot;denoted by italics&quot; in the below table; overtime has been used in bowl games since the 1995–96 bowl season. The inaugural game in 1935 was contested between high school teams. For sponsorship reasons, the 1989 through 1993 editions were known as the John Hancock Bowl.

Rankings are based on the AP poll, prior to game being played.
Note: the bowl&#x27;s game programs indicate that organizers consider the unplayed 2020 game to have been the 87th edition, as the 2021 game is referred to as the 88th edition, the 2022 game as the 89th edition, etc.

<text>Juan Sánchez Vidal (born January 3, 1958) is a model aircraft collector. Sánchez Vidal, born in the Palma de Mallorca, has over one thousand commercial airline models, a collection which many experts believe to be the largest aircraft collection in the world.

==Life and hobby==
Sánchez Vidal was born near Son Bonet.
At the age of fifteen, Sánchez Vidal began working at Son Sant Joan Airport. He retired from that job in 2020.

Sánchez Vidal began working with defunct Spanish airline Spantax, acquiring his first model, a Convair CV-990 of that airline, in 1973. He made friendships with co-workers of other airlines, and he began receiving more models. Rodolfo Bay, then president of Spantax, personally gave Sánchez Vidal an airplane model.

Eventually, his hobby led him to meet some more airline personalities, some of them famous celebrities, like Niki Lauda, Formula One champion and owner of Lauda Air. The largest model in his collection, a model of an Air France Airbus A320, was obtained after he traded one of his planes with a local Air France worker who also collected models. He also made a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 model of Air Europa, airline for which he then worked. Air Europa never actually used this type of aircraft in real life.

He also has models of American Airlines&#x27; Boeing 757 and Boeing 767, the same type of aircraft used for the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Sánchez Vidal and his collection have been the objects of many reports and interviews by many specialized magazines.

In 2000, personnel at Barajas International Airport in Madrid negotiated with Sánchez Vidal so that he could display his collection at the international arrivals terminal of that airport. In March of that year, his collection began being showcased at that airport. The collection lasted there until 2003. He had also held an exhibition of his models at Son Sant Joan Airport, in 1987.

Sanchez Vidal is fluent in Spanish and Catalan.

<doc id="335341" wikidata="Q15618993" url="?curid=335341" title="President of Egypt">
<text>The president of the Arab Republic of Egypt () is the executive head of state of Egypt and the de facto appointer of the official head of government under the Egyptian Constitution of 2014. Under the various iterations of the Constitution of Egypt following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the president is also the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, and head of the executive branch of the Egyptian government.

Six presidents took over the presidency of Egypt after the abolition of the monarchy in 1953, in periods that included short transitional periods. They began with Mohamed Naguib, then Gamal Abdel Nasser, and Anwar Sadat. He was followed by Hosni Mubarak, and then Mohamed Morsi. The current president is Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has been in office since 8 June 2014.

==History==
The first president of Egypt was Mohamed Naguib, who, along with Gamal Abdel Nasser, led the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 that overthrew King Farouk and marked the end of British colonial rule. Though Farouk&#x27;s infant son was formally declared by the revolutionaries as King Fuad II, all effective executive power was vested in Naguib and the Revolutionary Command Council. On 18 June 1953, just under a year after the coup d&#x27;état, the Council abolished the monarchy of Egypt and Sudan, and declared Egypt a republic, with Mohamed Naguib as its president.

Naguib resigned as president in November 1954, following a severe rift with the younger military officers who had participated with him in the revolution. Thereafter, the office of president remained vacant until January 1956, when Gamal Abdel Nasser was elected as president via a plebiscite. Nasser would remain as president of Egypt, as well as president of the United Arab Republic, which lasted from 1958 to 1971, until his sudden death in September 1970 at the age of 52.

Nasser was succeeded by his vice president, Anwar Sadat, who was elected by plebiscite in October 1970. Sadat served as president until his assassination in October 1981, and shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin in 1978 for initiating peace talks between the two countries. He was succeeded by his vice president, Hosni Mubarak, who was elected president by plebiscite and remained so for nearly 30 years.

In the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, Mubarak, who held office from 14 October 1981 until 11 February 2011, was forced to resign following mass nationwide protests demanding his removal from office. On 10 February 2011 Mubarak transferred presidential powers to his recently appointed vice president, Omar Suleiman. Suleiman&#x27;s wielding of presidential powers was a momentary formality, as the position of president of Egypt was then officially vacated, and the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, led by Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, assumed executive control of the state.

On 30 June 2012, the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Mohamed Morsi was sworn in as President of Egypt, having won the 2012 Egyptian presidential election on 24 June; he was the first president to gain power solely through an election via popular vote. However, Morsi&#x27;s presidency was short-lived, and slightly more than a year later on 3 July 2013 he was removed from office following mass protests against his rule.

Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who served as Defense Minister under Morsi&#x27;s presidency and retained his post after Morsi&#x27;s removal from office, permanently retired from the Egyptian Armed Forces in 2014 and then went on to win the 2014 presidential election, being sworn in as president on 8 June 2014. He was later re-elected to a second term in 2018 after winning the 2018 presidential election. In April 2019, Egypt&#x27;s parliament extended presidential terms from four to six years. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was also allowed to run for third term in next election in 2024. In December 2023, President al-Sisi won the 2023 presidential election for a third term in office. He was inaugurated in April 2024.

===Old electoral system===

The Egyptian Constitution has had various forms since the establishment of the republic in 1953. In all iterations of the republican constitution until 2005, the method of electing the president is based on that of the French Fifth Republic. Both the pre-revolution Egyptian Civil Code, and the semi-presidential system of government adopted after the revolution were strongly influenced by the legal and political tradition of France. In this two-stage system, the Egyptian legislature, the National Assembly (a name also inspired by its French counterpart), nominates one of a number of candidates for the presidency.

A candidate needs at least a two-thirds majority in the Assembly in order to win the nomination. In the second stage, the candidate is confirmed in office by popular plebiscite of all eligible voters in the country. Egypt maintained this system even after it was abandoned by France in 1962 in Favour of direct presidential elections, eliminating the role of the legislature in the election of the French president. In the Egyptian Constitution of 1971, the name of the National Assembly was changed to the People&#x27;s Assembly.

===2005 and 2007 constitutional amendments===

In 2005 and 2007, constitutional amendments were made. Principles in the amended constitution include:
* Election of the president of the republic by direct secret ballot by citizens who have the right to vote.
* Ensuring that multiple candidates be put forward for the people to choose from.
* Ensuring the credibility of the nomination process.
* Providing the opportunity for political parties to put forward one of their leaders to contest the first presidential elections to be held in light of the amendment.
* The establishment of a presidential election commission that would enjoy complete independence to supervise the election process.
* Ensuring judicial supervision over the voting process.

The following provisions regarding the election process are stipulated in Article 76 as amended:
* A successful candidate must be elected by the majority of the votes. If no candidate attains such a majority, elections will be repeated after at least seven days between the two candidates having the highest votes. In case of a tie between the candidate who attained the second highest votes and a third candidate, the third candidate shall participate in the second round. The candidate who receives the highest votes in the second round shall be declared president.
* The amendment also provides that a law will be passed to regulate the relevant election procedures. This law is expected to regulate the various aspects of the election process itself, including campaign funding, equal access to the media, and guarantees of fair competition.
* As required by the amendment, the law will be submitted to the Supreme Constitutional Court to opine on its constitutionality. This establishes an important precedent in Egypt&#x27;s legal tradition, by which the Supreme Constitutional Court shall have the right of prior review of national legislation to decide on its compatibility with the Constitution. This differs from the practice thus far by which the review process undertaken by the Court on national legislation was done by judicial review subsequent to the passage of legislation.

==Presidential powers==
Under the system created by the 1980, 2003 and 2007 constitutional amendments to the 1971 Constitution, the President is the pre-eminent executive figure, who names the Prime Minister of Egypt as well as appoints the Cabinet per the latter&#x27;s recommendation, while in reality, he was the head of both the state and of the government, as well as being the top foreign policy maker and holding supreme command over the military. During martial law, the President also appoints deans of faculties and majors, and can also enlist or oust people in the private sector. The President then also has the power to issue regulations for the enforcement of laws, ensuring proper public services, etc., which have been transferred to the Prime Minister under the 2012 and 2014 Constitutions. Egypt had been under martial law since 1981. After the Egyptian revolution in 2011 that ousted the 30-year regime of then President Hosni Mubarak, the martial law was temporarily suspended.

The 2012 Constitution provided for a semi-presidential form of government in which the president shares executive powers with the prime minister, until it was suspended following Morsi&#x27;s removal from office. This structure was retained by the 2014 Constitution, which was drafted following Morsi&#x27;s ousting and came into effect after a referendum in 2014.

Under the present 2014 Constitution, the president is the head of state as well as that of the executive. The president lays down, along with the prime minister and the cabinet, the state&#x27;s general policy and oversees its implementation. The president represents Egypt in foreign relations and has the power to ratify treaties, can issue decrees having the force of law when the House of Representatives is in recess, and such decrees are subject to approval by the House after resuming its sessions at the end of the recess, and acts as the supreme commander of the armed forces. The president also has the power of pardon and can exercise necessary powers in times of emergency.

==Election==
Election procedures are taken within sixty days before the end of the incumbent president&#x27;s term.

===Last election===
===Requirements and candidacy===
Article 141 of the Egyptian Constitution establishes the requirements one must meet in order to become president. They must be an Egyptian citizen, be born to Egyptian parents (never having dual nationality), have participated in the military or been exempted from it, and cannot be less than forty years old.

Additional requirements were provisioned in Article 142 of the Egyptian constitution concerning candidates for the president&#x27;s office. Candidates must have the recommendation of 20 members of the House of Representatives or the endorsement of 25,000 people across 15 governorates, with at least 1,000 signatures from each.

===Presidential Election Commission===
The amendment to Article 76 of the constitution provides for the establishment of a &quot;Presidential Election Commission&quot; that would have complete independence and would be charged with the supervision of the presidential election process.

The commission is composed of ten members, presided by the chief justice of the Supreme Constitutional Court and four other ex officio members of the judiciary who are the most senior serving deputy president of each of the Supreme Constitutional, the Court of Cassation, and the High Administrative Court, and the president of the Cairo Court of Appeal.

The rest of the commission is made up from five independent and neutral public figures: three to be selected by the People&#x27;s Assembly and two to be selected by the Shoura Council.

Decisions of this Committee shall be passed by a majority of seven votes. This commission has a term of five years and is exclusively competent to supervise the presidential election process, including accepting nominations, announcing the names of accepted candidates, supervision of election procedures, vote counting and announcement of the results.

It also has final judicial competence to rule on any contesting or challenge submitted in relation to the presidential elections, and its decisions are final and subject to no appeal. The committee may issue its own regulations and shall be competent to establish general sub-committees from among members of the judiciary, to monitor the various phases of the election process, under its supervision. The election process shall be completed in one day.

==Inauguration and oath of office==
In accordance with Article 79 of the constitution, the president must take the following oath or affirmation before exercising his functions: &quot;I swear by God the Almighty to sincerely maintain the Republican system, to respect the Constitution and law, to fully care about the interests of the people, and to maintain the independence and territorial integrity of the Homeland.&quot;

==Term(s) of office==
Under the previous Constitution, the president served for a term of four years. The president is limited to two terms, whether the terms are successive or separated.

On 14 February 2019, the Egyptian parliament voted overwhelmingly to approve draft amendments to the country&#x27;s 2014 constitution; among other things, these amendments extend the duration of presidential terms from four years to six years, and allow incumbent president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to extend his current term to the 6 year length, as well as serve a third and final term, exempting him from the two-term limit that otherwise applies to the office of president. These amendments were subsequently ratified in the 2019 Egyptian constitutional referendum.

During their tenure in office, the president is not allowed to be a formal member of a political party.

If the president-elect is announced before the end of the incumbent president&#x27;s term, the incumbent president continues in office until the end of their term.

==Succession==

In the case of temporary incapacitation of the president, the constitution provides the president to relinquish his powers to the vice president or the prime minister. However, the person who takes office is limited in power as the new president cannot dissolve the parliament, propose constitutional amendments or remove the cabinet from office.

In case of the vacancy of the presidential office or the permanent incapacitation of the President, the Speaker of the People&#x27;s Assembly shall temporarily assume the presidency. In case the People&#x27;s Assembly is dissolved at such a time, the President of the Supreme Constitutional Court shall take over the presidency on condition that neither shall nominate themselves for the presidency. Both are also limited in power as in they cannot dissolve the parliament, remove the cabinet, or propose constitutional amendments.

The People&#x27;s Assembly shall then proclaim the vacancy of the office of president, and a new president shall be chosen within a maximum period of sixty days from the date of the vacancy of the office.

Although, the constitution does not directly stipulate any role for the vice president in the process of presidential succession, it had become a tradition for the People&#x27;s Assembly to nominate a vice president for the vacant office of the president. Both Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak served as vice-presidents at the time the presidential office became vacant; however, on Mubarak&#x27;s succession in 1981 as president, he did not appoint a vice-president until 29 January 2011, when during substantial protests demanding reforms, he appointed Omar Suleiman to the role.

===Resignation===
The president may resign by delivering their resignation to the People&#x27;s Assembly under the 2012 and 2014 Constitutions.

Gamal Abdel Nasser submitted his resignation after the overwhelming Egyptian defeat in the Six-Day War, before retracting it following mass demonstrations from the Egyptian public. President Mubarak also resigned on 11 February 2011 during mass protests against his regime.

==Official residences==
The presidency in Egypt operates eight presidential residences in addition to other presidential guest houses. The official residence and office of the president is Heliopolis Palace in Cairo. Other presidential palaces include:
* Abdeen Palace, in Old Cairo;
* Koubbeh Palace, in Cairo;
* Ras Al-Teen Palace, in Alexandria;
* Montaza Palace, in Alexandria;
* Al-Tahra Palace, in Cairo;
* Al-Oroba Palace, in Cairo.

<text>The president of the Republic of Afghanistan was constitutionally the head of state and head of government of the Republic of Afghanistan (1987–1992) and Commander-in-Chief of the Afghan Armed Forces.

After the Fall of Kabul in 1992, he was deposed and replaced by the Islamic State.

==Eligibility and selection process==
Article 62 of the 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan stated that a candidate for the office of President had to:
* be a citizen of Afghanistan, Muslim, born of Afghan parents;
* not be a citizen of another country;
* be at least forty years old when declaring candidacy;
* not have been convicted of crimes against humanity, a criminal act or deprived of civil rights by a court;
* not have previously served more than two terms as president.

==Powers==
The 2004 Constitution granted the president wide powers over military and legislative affairs, with a relatively weak national bicameral National Assembly, the House of the People (Wolesi Jirga) and the House of Elders (Meshrano Jirga). A president could only serve up to two five-year terms.

Hamid Karzai began his first five-year term in 2004. After his second term ended in 2014, Ashraf Ghani was elected as the next Afghan president.

This is a list of Presidents of Afghanistan. Afghanistan has only intermittently been a republic – between 1973–1992 and from 2001 onward – at other times being governed by a variety of kings, emirs, as well as mujahideen and Taliban leaders in the 1990s.

The present constitution of Afghanistan grants the president wide powers over military and legislative affairs, with a relatively weak national parliament. These were a subject of considerable controversy when debated by the country&#x27;s &quot;Loya jirga&quot; (&quot;Grand assembly&quot;) in December 2003. However, they were seen by the Transitional Administration and its Western backers as being essential to securing the stability of Afghanistan.

The former president Hamid Karzai became the first ever democratically elected head of state in Afghanistan on December 7, 2004. The current president is Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, since September 29, 2014.

<doc id="335344" wikidata="Q2937412" url="?curid=335344" title="Citrus Bowl">
<text>The Citrus Bowl is an annual college football bowl game played at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. The bowl is operated by Florida Citrus Sports, a non-profit group that also organizes the Pop-Tarts Bowl and Florida Classic.

The game was first played as the Tangerine Bowl in 1947 before being renamed as the Florida Citrus Bowl in 1983. When Capital One was the game&#x27;s title sponsor between 2001 and 2014, the game was referred to as the Capital One Bowl from 2003 to 2014. Other previous sponsors include CompUSA (1994–1999), Ourhouse.com (2000), Buffalo Wild Wings (2015–2017), Overton&#x27;s (2018), and Vrbo (2019–2022). On November 15, 2022, Kellogg&#x27;s (renamed Kellanova after the company spun off its North American cereal business in 2023 as WK Kellogg Co) signed on as title sponsor of the game, placing its Cheez-It brand of snack crackers in the title position. Accordingly, the game is officially named the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl.

Since the mid-1980s, the Citrus Bowl has drawn many high-ranked teams and is typically played at 1 p.m. EST on New Year&#x27;s Day and broadcast nationally on ABC. When January 1 is a Sunday, the game has been played on January 2 or December 31, to avoid conflicting with the National Football League (NFL) schedule. , it has the largest payout of all bowls other than those that are part of the College Football Playoff (CFP), at $8.55 million per team. In nearly every year since 1985, the game has featured two teams ranked in the Top 25.

==History==
===Tangerine Bowl (1947–1982)===
The game, which began play in 1947, is one of the oldest of the non-CFP bowls, along with the Gator Bowl and Sun Bowl. By 1952, the game was dubbed the &quot;Little Bowl with the Big Heart&quot;, because all the proceeds from the game went to charity. 

From 1964 through 1967, it was one of the four regional finals in the College Division (which became Division II and Division III in 1973), along with the Pecan, Grantland Rice, and Camellia bowls. In this capacity, the Tangerine Bowl sought to match the two best non-major teams in a 17-state Eastern Region stretching from New England to Florida.

In 1968, the Boardwalk Bowl in Atlantic City took over as the College Division Eastern regional final, and the Tangerine Bowl became a major college bowl game, featuring teams from the University Division (which became Division I in 1973).

The Tangerine Bowl name was used through the December 1982 game. The same name was re-used later, but for a bowl game with a different lineage.
===Florida Citrus Bowl (1983–2002)===
In March 1983, the name of the game was changed from Tangerine Bowl to Florida Citrus Bowl, via a $1.25 million agreement with the Florida Citrus Commission; the bowl&#x27;s organizing committee also changed its name from Tangerine Sports Association to Florida Citrus Sports Association. A month earlier, organizers had rejected a proposal to rename the game to Grapefruit Bowl.

In 1986, it was one of the bowl games considered for the site of the &quot;winner take all&quot; national championship game between Penn State and Miami, before the Fiesta Bowl was eventually chosen.

The January 1991 game had national championship implications for the 1990 season; Georgia Tech won the Florida Citrus Bowl, finished 11–0–1, and was voted the 1990 UPI national champion. That occurrence marks a rare example of a non-New Year&#x27;s Six bowl game featuring a team later named national champion.

The January 1, 1998, game, which featured nearby Florida beating Penn State, holds the game&#x27;s attendance record at 72,940.

===Capital One Bowl (2003–2014)===
Starting with the January 2003 edition, the bowl was renamed as the Capital One Bowl, with title sponsorship by Capital One.

In 2004, the bowl bid to become the fifth BCS game, but was not chosen, primarily due to the stadium&#x27;s aging condition. In July 2007, the Orange County Commissioners voted in favor of spending $1.1 billion to build the Amway Center for the Orlando Magic, the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, and to upgrade the Citrus Bowl stadium.

Following the January 2014 game, Capital One ceased its sponsorship of the bowl, and moved its sponsorship to the Orange Bowl.

===Citrus Bowl (2015–present)===
Buffalo Wild Wings was announced as the new sponsor of the bowl game, which was renamed as Citrus Bowl, for the January 2015 edition. Buffalo Wild Wings had previously been the title sponsor of what had been the Insight Bowl. In the offseason of 2017, Buffalo Wild Wings ceased sponsoring the bowl. Following sponsorship by Overton&#x27;s (2018) and Vrbo (2019–2022), Kellogg&#x27;s became the title sponsor in November 2022, via its Cheez-It brand.

The 2016 season game was played on December 31, the first time in 30 years that the game was not played on January 1 or 2.

===Conference tie-ins===
From 1968 through 1975, the bowl featured the Mid-American Conference (MAC) champion against an opponent from the Southern Conference (1968–1971), the Southeastern Conference (SEC) (1973–1974), or an at-large opponent (1972, 1975). MAC teams were 6–2 during those games.

As the major football conferences relaxed restrictions on post-season play in the mid-1970s, the bowl went to a matchup between two at-large teams from major conferences, with one school typically (but not always) from the South.

From the 1987 season through the 1991 season, the bowl featured the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) champion against an at-large opponent. ACC teams were 3–2 during those games.

From the 1992 season through the 2015 season, the bowl featured an SEC vs. Big Ten matchup – the SEC won 14 of those games, while the Big Ten won 10.

During the 1990s, the second-place finisher in the SEC typically went to this bowl. Florida coach Steve Spurrier, speaking to the fact that Tennessee occupied that spot three of four years as Florida finished first, famously quipped &quot;You can&#x27;t spell &#x27;Citrus&#x27; without U-T!&quot;

Currently, the bowl has tie-ins with the SEC and the Big Ten, holding the first selection after the CFP selection process for both conferences. Since the formation of the CFP, the Citrus Bowl has a chance to occasionally host an ACC team, replacing the Big Ten representative. This will happen the years in which the Orange Bowl is not a CFP semi-final game and selects a Big Ten team to match against their ACC team. This happened following the 2016 season, as the Orange Bowl was not a CFP semi-final and invited Michigan of the Big Ten to face Florida State of the ACC; the Citrus Bowl then invited Louisville of the ACC to face LSU of the SEC. The next year, Wisconsin was invited to the Orange Bowl, so the SEC&#x27;s LSU was pitted against Notre Dame, who received an invite in lieu of an ACC team.

===Racial integration===
The undefeated 1955 Hillsdale College football team refused an invitation to the January 1956 edition of the bowl when bowl officials insisted that Hillsdale&#x27;s four African-American players would not be allowed to play in the game.
The University at Buffalo&#x27;s first bowl bid was to the December 1958 edition. The Tangerine Bowl Commission hoped that the Orlando High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), which operated the stadium, would waive its rule that prohibited integrated sporting events. When it refused, the team unanimously voted to skip the bowl because its two black players (halfback Willie Evans and end Mike Wilson) would not have been allowed on the field. Buffalo did not become bowl-eligible for another 50 years. During the 2008 season, when the Bulls were on the verge of bowl eligibility, the 1958 team was profiled on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Outside the Lines&quot;. The 2008 team went on to win the Mid-American Conference title, and played in the International Bowl.
Eight years later, OHSAA&#x27;s rule had been changed, and Morgan State of Baltimore, under head coach Earl Banks, became the first historically black college to play in (and win) a Tangerine Bowl.
===Gainesville===
In early 1973, construction improvements were planned for the then 17,000-seat Tangerine Bowl stadium to expand to over 51,000 seats. In early summer 1973, however, construction was stalled due to legal concerns, and the improvements were delayed. Late in the 1973 season, Tangerine Bowl President Will Gieger and other officials planned to invite the Miami Redskins and the East Carolina Pirates to Orlando for the game. On November 19, 1973, East Carolina withdrew from bowl consideration when no invitation arrived before Thanksgiving break, and the bowl was left with one at-large bid. In an unexpected and unprecedented move, game officials decided to invite the Florida Gators, and move the game to Florida Field in Gainesville, the Gators&#x27; home stadium. The larger stadium was needed to accommodate the large crowd expected. The move required special permission from the NCAA, and special accommodations were made. Both teams were headquartered in Orlando for the week, and spent most of their time there, including practices, and were bused up to Gainesville.

The participants were greeted with an unexpected event, a near-record low temperature of . Despite the home-field advantage, in the game nicknamed the &quot;Transplant Bowl&quot;, Miami, who found the cold much more to its liking, defeated the Gators, 16–7. One of the players on the victorious Redskins squad was future Gators coach Ron Zook.

The one-time moving of the game, and the fears of a permanent relocation, rejuvenated the stalled stadium renovations in Orlando. The game returned to Orlando for 1974, and within a couple of years, the expansion project was complete.

===Mascot Challenge===
The &quot;Capital One Mascot Challenge&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;Capital One National Mascot of the Year&quot;) was a contest where fans voted for their favorite college mascot. The contest began in 2002 with the winner being named during the halftime; the winning school was awarded $20,000 towards their mascot program. With the ending of Capital One&#x27;s sponsorship of the Citrus Bowl, the challenge was moved in 2014 to the Orange Bowl with Capital One&#x27;s sponsorship of that game. The 2014 season was also the last time that the contest was held.

<doc id="335349" wikidata="Q949948" url="?curid=335349" title="Sports drink">
<text>Sports drinks, also known as electrolyte drinks, are functional beverages whose stated purpose is to help athletes replace water, electrolytes, and energy before, during and especially after training or competition. The evidence is lacking pertaining to the efficacy of use of commercial sports drinks for sports and fitness performance.

Consuming too much or in unnecessary circumstances may hinder health or performance. The drinks, or some of their ingredients such as sugar, may not be suitable for certain conditions.

==Categories==
Sports drinks can be split into three major types:
*Isotonic sport drinks contain similar concentrations of salt and sugar as in the human body.
*Hypertonic sport drinks contain a higher concentration of salt and sugar than the human body.
*Hypotonic sport drinks contain a lower concentration of salt and sugar than the human body.
Most sports drinks are approximately isotonic, having between 4 and 5 heaped teaspoons of sugar per eight ounce (13 and 19 grams per 250ml) serving.

==Purpose and effectiveness==
Athletes that are actively training lose water and electrolytes from their bodies by sweating, and expending energy. Sports drinks are sometimes chosen to be a solution for this problem through fluid replacement, carbohydrate loading and nutrient supplementation, although the same source also states that &quot;Whether water or a sports drink is consumed is the athlete&#x27;s choice.&quot;

Studies show that, contrary to popular belief, the consumption of an electrolyte-containing sports drink does not protect against hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood). This is likely due to the fact that the sodium content of these drinks is in the range of 20 to 30 meq/L.

A stated purpose of sports drinks, which provide many calories of energy from sugars, is to improve performance and endurance. The potential benefits of sports drinks depends upon other factors including the quantity of the beverage ingested, the time it takes for the drink to be emptied from ones body, absorption time, and the carbohydrate type, although the same source states that &quot;there is little evidence that any one sports drink is superior to any of the other beverages on the market.&quot;.

A 2019 meta-review found that &quot;dairy milk may provide either comparable or superior recovery nutrition qualities with regards to muscle protein synthesis, glycogen replenishment, rehydration, and subsequent endurance exercise performance, when compared to non-nutritive, carbohydrate replacement, and (or) carbohydrate-electrolyte alternatives.&quot;

=== Potentially harmful effects ===
Some potentially harmful health effects of drinking sports drinks without prolonged exercise include weight gain, diabetes and dental erosion. These drinks are high in calories and sugar which thereby can contribute towards an unhealthy diet. Generally, commercial sports drinks contain two-thirds the amount of sugar found in a normal soda. The sugar found in these sports drinks still exceeds the recommended amount of sugar in a day for a child.

Energy drinks, which are often confused with sports drinks, usually contain high amount of caffeine among other dietary supplements. Often the concentration of caffeine is higher than found in soft drinks. In moderate amounts, caffeine is not harmful and can provide various benefits regarding endurance; however, in large amounts this can have adverse effects. Although energy drinks may contain various different dietary supplements, health studies have claimed that there is a lack of thorough labelling which means that consumers may not always be aware of what they are consuming.

==History==
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, athletes occasionally drank beer of low alcohol content to replenish water, minerals and energy in the body. As the water is boiled during the brewing process and thus sterilized, the beer was a safer option than water from an unknown source. However, studies suggest that even a low dose of ethanol decreases endurance performance: it inhibits liver glucose output during exercise, and also impairs psychomotor skills such as reaction time, hand-eye coordination and balance.

Since the first modern Olympics, fluid intake during sports have been much varied due to a lack of consensus in the scientific community pertaining to the use of sports drinks. In the early 1900s there was a widespread belief that consumption of fluids such as water during exercise was unnecessary. However, with the advancement of exercise physiology in 1923, the cardiovascular model of thermoregulation was researched by A.V. Hill. Based on this model, the consequences of water loss and the significance of fluid consumption was emphasized.

Energy drinks and sports drinks first appeared in Europe and Asia in the 1960s as a response to demands for dietary supplements that would increase energy. Taisho Pharmaceuticals, a Japanese company, introduced Lipovitan D, one of the first energy drinks on the market in 1961. Since then, both energy drink and sports drinks have developed into a multibillion-dollar market.

== Commercial market ==
The sports and energy drinks market is rapidly growing around the world. Sports drinks are included within the functional drinks market. Within the functional drinks category, sports and energy drinks account for the largest volume growth. These drinks have experienced exponential growth of more than 240% in the United States of America and around the world from the years 2004 to 2009.

There have been a variety of different types of drinks introduced to the market over the years, many of which target young athletes.

<doc id="335351" wikidata="Q2955927" url="?curid=335351" title="Pop-Tarts Bowl">
<text>The Pop-Tarts Bowl is an annual college football bowl game that is played in Orlando, Florida, at Camping World Stadium. Originally commissioned as the Sunshine Classic, it has undergone many name changes due to sponsorship rights. The bowl is operated by Florida Citrus Sports, a non-profit group which also organizes the Citrus Bowl and the Florida Classic. It was first played in 1990 in Miami Gardens, Florida, before moving to Orlando in 2001. The game has tie-ins with the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and Big 12 Conference. In the College Football Playoff (CFP) era, the bowl seeks to match the top non-CFP selection from the ACC (inclusive of Notre Dame) against the second non-CFP selection from the Big 12.

Since 2020, the bowl has been sponsored by Kellogg&#x27;s / Kellanova through its Cheez-It and Pop-Tarts brands.

==History==
The bowl was founded in 1990 by Raycom Sports and was originally played at Joe Robbie Stadium outside the city of Miami. It was formed as the Sunshine Football Classic, but due to corporate title sponsorships, was never contested under this name, nor even referred to as such except during brief intervals between corporate sponsors. During its Miami existence, it successively went by the names Blockbuster Bowl (three editions), CarQuest Bowl (five editions), and the MicronPC Bowl (three editions).

In 2001, the bowl changed hands, and was relocated to Orlando. The bowl was played three times as the Tangerine Bowl, a historical moniker that was the original title of the Citrus Bowl. Foot Locker, the parent company of Champs Sports, purchased naming rights in 2004, naming it the Champs Sports Bowl, under which eight games were played. In early 2012, naming rights were bought by Russell Athletic; five games were played as the Russell Athletic Bowl. In early 2017, Camping World became the title sponsor of the game through 2019; three editions were staged as the Camping World Bowl, concluding with the 30th playing of the bowl. In May 2020, Kellogg&#x27;s signed on as the new sponsor of the game, naming the game the Cheez-It Bowl, after the company&#x27;s brand of snack crackers.

In May 2023, it was announced that the sponsorship would be switched to the Pop-Tarts brand (Kellogg&#x27;s had acquired the naming rights to the Citrus Bowl, concurrently moving the Cheez-It sponsorship to that game). The new trophy for the bowl was unveiled in December and features two slots for Pop-Tarts atop a metallic football. The mascot, named &quot;Strawberry&quot;, is a large anthropomorphic Pop-Tart that was deemed the &quot;first-ever edible mascot&quot;; it was lowered into a giant toaster and presented for players to eat after the game, having been replaced by an edible replica. 

For the 2024 game, the bowl held a fan vote of three flavors to serve as main mascot: Cinnamon Roll, Hot Fudge Sundae, and Wild Berry. Cinnamon Roll was declared the winner on December 6. The 2024 trophy was also a functional toaster, manufactured by GE Appliances, with a weight of 77 pounds. Strawberry received a memorial outside the stadium, and was subsequently &quot;resurrected&quot; following a tribute during the first half—taking the form of a mascot now resembling the replica after it was eaten.

===Miami===
The bowl arose from a desire to hold a second bowl game in the Miami area. It was to be an accompaniment to the traditional Orange Bowl, showcasing the brand new stadium in the area that was built in 1987. The Orange Bowl game was still being played in the aging old stadium, whereas this new game would be played in the new stadium.

Miami Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga quickly joined forces with bowl organizers and brought in Blockbuster Video, which he owned, as title sponsor. The inaugural game, played on December 28, 1990, pitted Florida State and Penn State, and two legendary coaches, Bobby Bowden versus Joe Paterno in front of over 74,000 at Joe Robbie Stadium. Subsequent games were unable to match the success of the first, even though the bowl was moved to the more prestigious New Year&#x27;s Day slot in 1993.

In 1994, CarQuest Auto Parts became the title sponsor after Huizenga sold Blockbuster Video to Viacom. The New Year&#x27;s Day experiment was short lived as the organizers of the more established Orange Bowl received permission to move their game into Joe Robbie Stadium beginning in 1996. That bumped the Carquest Bowl back to the less-desirable December date. After the 2000 playing, Florida Citrus Sports took over the game and moved it to Orlando.

Before gaining Blockbuster Entertainment as the corporate sponsor for the inaugural event, the game was tentatively referred to as the Sunshine Classic.

===Orlando===

From 2006 to 2010, the bowl matched teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and the Big Ten Conference. Under the terms of a television deal signed with ESPN in 2006, the bowl was to be held after Christmas Day from 2006 onward, and be shown on ESPN in prime time. The change was made to move the game from the less-desirable pre-Christmas date utilized from 2001 to 2004.

From 2005 to 2009, the stadium faced challenges in preparing the stadium for two bowl games in less than one week (the Citrus Bowl is traditionally held New Year&#x27;s Day). This was also in part due to the Florida high school football championship games being held at the stadium shortly before the bowls. In 2009, rainy weather turned the stadium&#x27;s grass field into a muddy, sloppy, quagmire for both bowl games. In 2010, the stadium switched to artificial turf, facilitating the quick turnaround necessary.

In 2009, the bowl announced that the Big East was to be one of the tie-in conferences for four years starting in 2010, with the bowl having the option of selecting Notre Dame once during the four years. In October 2009, the bowl announced that they had extended their agreement with the ACC for the same term. The game would match the third pick from the ACC against the second selection from the Big East. The previous agreement had matched the 4th pick from the ACC against the 4th or 5th pick from the Big Ten. ACC and Big East teams subsequently met in the 2010 through 2013 games, except for 2011 when Notre Dame was selected (as permitted in the agreement with the Big East) and in 2013 when the Louisville Cardinals of the American Athletic Conference were selected (&quot;The American&quot; became the football successor to the Big East in 2013).

Since 2014, the game features the second pick from the ACC after the New Year&#x27;s Six bowls make their picks—usually the losing team from the ACC Football Championship Game, or one of the division runners-up—against the third pick from the Big 12.

<doc id="335354" wikidata="Q83893" url="?curid=335354" title="Ingot">
<text>An ingot is a piece of relatively pure material, usually metal, that is cast into a shape suitable for further processing. In steelmaking, it is the first step among semi-finished casting products. Ingots usually require a second procedure of shaping, such as cold/hot working, cutting, or milling to produce a useful final product. Non-metallic and semiconductor materials prepared in bulk form may also be referred to as ingots, particularly when cast by mold based methods. Precious metal ingots can be used as currency (with or without being processed into other shapes), or as a currency reserve, as with gold bars.

==Types==
Ingots are generally made of metal, either pure or alloy, heated past its melting point and cast into a bar or block using a mold chill method.

A special case are polycrystalline or single crystal ingots made by pulling from a molten melt.

===Single crystal===

Single crystal ingots (called boules) of materials are grown (crystal growth) using methods such as the Czochralski process or Bridgman technique.

The boules may be either semiconductor (e.g. electronic chip wafers, photovoltaic cells) or non-conducting inorganic compounds for industrial and jewelry use (e.g., synthetic ruby, sapphire).

Single crystal ingots of metal are produced in similar fashion to that used to produce high purity semiconductor ingots, i.e. by vacuum induction refining. Single crystal ingots of engineering metals are of interest due to their very high strength due to lack of grain boundaries. The method of production is via single crystal dendrite and not via simple casting. Possible uses include turbine blades.

===Copper alloys===
In the United States, the brass and bronze ingot making industry started in the early 19th century. The US brass industry grew to be the number one producer by the 1850s. During colonial times the brass and bronze industries were almost non-existent because the British demanded all copper ore be sent to Britain for processing. Copper based alloy ingots weighed approximately .

==Manufacture==
Ingots are manufactured by the cooling of a molten liquid (known as the melt) in a mold. The manufacture of ingots has several aims.

Firstly, the mold is designed to completely solidify and form an appropriate grain structure required for later processing, as the structure formed by the cooling of the melt controls the physical properties of the material.

Secondly, the shape and size of the mold is designed to allow for ease of ingot handling and downstream processing. Finally, the mold is designed to minimize melt wastage and aid ejection of the ingot, as losing either melt or ingot increases manufacturing costs of finished products.

A variety of designs exist for the mold, which may be selected to suit the physical properties of the liquid melt and the solidification process. Molds may exist in the top, horizontal or bottom-up pouring and may be fluted or flat walled. The fluted design increases heat transfer owing to a larger contact area. Molds may be either solid &quot;massive&quot; design, sand cast (e.g. for pig iron), or water-cooled shells, depending upon heat transfer requirements. Ingot molds are tapered to prevent the formation of cracks due to uneven cooling. A crack or void formation occurs as the liquid to solid transition has an associated volume change for a constant mass of material. The formation of these ingot defects may render the cast ingot useless and may need to be re-melted, recycled, or discarded.


The physical structure of a crystalline material is largely determined by the method of cooling and precipitation of the molten metal. During the pouring process, metal in contact with the ingot walls rapidly cools and forms either a columnar structure or possibly a &quot;chill zone&quot; of equiaxed dendrites, depending upon the liquid being cooled and the cooling rate of the mold.

For a top-poured ingot, as the liquid cools within the mold, differential volume effects cause the top of the liquid to recede leaving a curved surface at the mold top which may eventually be required to be machined from the ingot. The mold cooling effect creates an advancing solidification front, which has several associated zones, closer to the wall there is a solid zone that draws heat from the solidifying melt, for alloys there may exist a &quot;mushy&quot; zone, which is the result of solid-liquid equilibrium regions in the alloy&#x27;s phase diagram, and a liquid region. The rate of front advancement controls the time that dendrites or nuclei have to form in the solidification region. The width of the mushy zone in an alloy may be controlled by tuning the heat transfer properties of the mold or adjusting the liquid melt alloy compositions.

Continuous casting methods for ingot processing also exist, whereby a stationary front of solidification is formed by the continual take-off of cooled solid material, and the addition of a molten liquid to the casting process.

Approximately 70 percent of aluminium ingots in the U.S. are cast using the direct chill casting process, which reduces cracking. A total of 5 percent of ingots must be scrapped because of stress induced cracks and butt deformation.

==Historical ingots==

Plano-convex ingots are widely distributed archaeological artifacts which are studied to provide information on the history of metallurgy.

<doc id="335356" wikidata="Q4727782" url="?curid=335356" title="All-American Bowl">
<text>The All-American Bowl was an annual postseason college football bowl game played at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama from 1977 to 1990. The game was known as the Hall of Fame Classic from 1977 to 1985.

In 1986, the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame decided to relocate the Hall of Fame bowl game to Tampa, Florida, where it eventually became known as the Outback Bowl (now the ReliaQuest Bowl). The game in Birmingham continued as the All-American Bowl, which was played for five years under a different organizing body.

When the Southeastern Conference expanded to twelve schools and began contesting a SEC Championship Game in 1992, Birmingham officials chose to host the conference title game and abandon the All-American Bowl. The SEC championship was moved to Atlanta&#x27;s Georgia Dome two years later, leaving Legion Field without any Division I-A postseason college football until 2006, when ESPN and the city agreed to establish a new post-season game, the Birmingham Bowl.

==The game==
The All-American Bowl played host to a number of successful teams from the premier college football conferences of the time (the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big Eight (now Big 12 Conference), Big Ten Conference, Southeastern Conference and Southwest Conference). All of them placed teams in the All-American Bowl in various years. At least one of the power conferences fielded teams in the All-American Bowl in every year of its existence; often, two of those premier conferences met in the game. The Southeastern Conference and Atlantic Coast Conference each placed five teams into the All-American Bowl. The Big Ten Conference proved to be the least successful conference, having never won a game despite placing teams in four different years.

==Game results==

==Most valuable players==
==Conference records==
*Southwest Conference 3–0 (1.000)
*Atlantic Coast Conference 4–1 (.800)
*Southeastern Conference 3–2 (.600)
*Western Athletic Conference 1–1 (.500)
*Big Eight Conference 1–2 (.333)
*Big Ten Conference 0–4 (.000)

==Ranked teams==
On several occasions, the All-American Bowl winners finished the season ranked in the AP Top Twenty poll:
*Texas A&amp;M finished #19 in the final 1978 AP poll after defeating #19 Iowa State.
*West Virginia finished #16 in the final 1983 AP poll after defeating Kentucky.
*Kentucky finished #19 in the final 1984 AP poll and the final UPI poll after defeating #20 Wisconsin.
*Georgia Tech finished #19 in the final 1985 AP poll after defeating Michigan State.
*Texas Tech finished #19 in the final 1989 AP poll after defeating #20 Duke.

<text>The Freedom Bowl was an annual post-season college football bowl game played at Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, California, from 1984 to 1994. 

The bowl frequently invited a team from the Western Athletic Conference to compete against an at-large opponent, provided that the conference had enough bowl-eligible teams.

After the 1994 season, the Freedom Bowl was discontinued as the WAC’s automatic bowl bids were reduced to one with the Holiday Bowl and Cotton Bowl Classic having choice of the conference champion.

<doc id="335363" wikidata="Q7241304" url="?curid=335363" title="President of the Senate (Australia)">
<text>The president of the Senate is the presiding officer of the Australian Senate, the upper house of the Parliament of Australia. The counterpart in the lower house is the speaker of the House of Representatives. The office of the presidency of the senate was established in 1901 by section 17 of the Constitution of Australia. The primary responsibilities of the office is to oversee senate debates, determine which senators may speak, maintain order and the parliamentary code of conduct during sessions and uphold all rules and orders of the senate. The current president is Sue Lines, who was elected on 26 July 2022.

The Senate elects one of its members as president at the start of each new term, or whenever the position is vacant. This is usually—though not necessarily—a member of the party or coalition that has formed government in the House of Representatives. Early presidents were members of the largest party or coalition in the Senate, which was not always the governing party, however this is no longer the case.

The president of the Senate&#x27;s primary task is to maintain parliamentary procedure in the chamber during legislative sessions. Unlike the speaker of the House, the president of the Senate votes as an ordinary member during general debate, and has no casting vote in the case of a tie (a casting vote would effectively give the president&#x27;s state an extra vote). The president of the Senate has also various administrative and ceremonial duties, sharing responsibility for the management of Parliament House and other parliamentary facilities and services with the speaker of the House.

==Election==
===Constitutional provisions===
Section 17 of the Constitution of Australia provides:

===Process===
The president is elected by the Senate in a secret ballot. The clerk conducts the election. The presidency has always been a partisan office and the nominee of the government party has nearly always been elected—although this cannot be guaranteed since the government of the day does not necessarily have a majority in the Senate. The president is assisted by an elected deputy president. The traditional practice has been that the government nominates a senator to be elected as president, and the Opposition nominates a Senator to be deputy president. If there are no other nominations, no election is required; however, the Australian Greens in 2005 and again in 2007 put forward Senator Kerry Nettle as a rival candidate when the position of president was vacant. Neither Government nor Opposition Senators supported that candidacy.

==Role==
===Parliamentary duties===
The president&#x27;s principal duty is to preside over the Senate, to maintain order in the Senate, uphold the Standing Orders (rules of procedure) and protect the rights of backbench senators. The president is assisted by the deputy president and a panel of acting deputy presidents, who usually preside during routine debates.

Although the president does not have the same degree of disciplinary power as the speaker does, the Senate is not as rowdy as most Australian legislative chambers, and thus his or her disciplinary powers are seldom exercised.

Unlike the speaker the president has a deliberative, but not a casting vote (in the event of an equality of votes, the motion fails). This is because the Senate is in theory a states&#x27; house, and depriving the president of a deliberative vote would have robbed one of the states or territories one of its senators&#x27; votes.

===Administrative duties===
The Senate president is the chief executive of the Department of the Senate, which is one of the four parliamentary departments. The president chairs the department&#x27;s budget committee and oversees its organisational structure. The president also co-administers the Department of Parliament Services (DPS) with the speaker of the House of Representatives.

===Ceremonial duties===
The president of the Senate is ranked highly in the Commonwealth Table of Precedence, either before or after the speaker of the House of Representatives depending on seniority. The president participates in the state opening of parliament, represents the parliament on overseas visits, and receives visiting delegations from other countries (and other distinguished visitors).

==Salary==
As with all other parliamentarians, the president of the Senate&#x27;s salary is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, an independent statutory body. As of 1 July 2019, the base salary for senators is A$211,242. The president is entitled to an additional &quot;salary of office&quot; comprising 75% of the base salary ($158,432), making for a total salary of $369,674 per annum and receives the various other entitlements and allowances available to senators.

==List of presidents of the Senate==

The position of president of the Senate has been disproportionately held by senators representing the least populous states and territories. There have been 25 presidents of the Senate since 1901. Of these 15 have come from the least populous states (Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania) or the Australian Capital Territory, and 10 have come from the three most populous states (New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland). All Senate presidents have been members of major parties, though not necessarily the governing party.

==Deputy President==

As well as a president, the Senate also elects a deputy president, whose formal title is Deputy President and Chairman of Committees. Until 1981, the title was just Chairman of Committees; it was changed &quot;to reflect more accurately the nature of the office in practice&quot;. The position is not provided for by the constitution, but instead by the Senate&#x27;s standing orders – it was borrowed more or less directly from the colonial legislative councils. The deputy president&#x27;s main tasks are to preside over committees of the whole and to serve as presiding officer when the president of the Senate is absent.

===List===
There have been 36 deputy presidents of the Senate, two of whom served multiple non-consecutive terms.

<doc id="335369" wikidata="Q1343063" url="?curid=335369" title="Here, There and Everywhere">
<text>&quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1966 album &quot;Revolver&quot;. A love ballad, it was written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon–McCartney. McCartney includes it among his personal favourites of the songs he has written. In 2000, &quot;Mojo&quot; ranked it 4th in the magazine&#x27;s list of the greatest songs of all time.

==Inspiration and background==
McCartney began writing &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; at Lennon&#x27;s house in Weybridge, in early June, while waiting for Lennon to wake up. McCartney recalled: &quot;I sat out by the pool on one of the sun chairs with my guitar and started strumming in E. And soon [I] had a few chords, and I think by the time he&#x27;d woken up, I had pretty much written the song, so we took it indoors and finished it up.&quot;

When discussing his song &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;, McCartney has often cited the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, his favourite pop song of all time, as a source of inspiration. In 1990, McCartney told Beach Boys biographer David Leaf that it was &quot;just the introduction that&#x27;s influenced [by the Beach Boys]&quot;, referring to the harmonies he and Lennon devised for the opening lines of &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;. McCartney added that, with this style of introduction, they wanted to capture the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; idea of a preamble to the song.

==Musical structure==
Author Kenneth Womack describes &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; as a romantic ballad &quot;about living in the here and now&quot; and &quot;fully experiencing the conscious moment&quot;. The verse is based on an ascending major chord sequence, while the middle eight (four bars in length) modulates to the relative major of the tonic. The introduction beginning &quot;To lead a better life&quot; opens in the key of G and involves a I–iii–III–ii–V7 chord progression. The III (B chord) on &quot;I need my love to be here&quot; (arpeggiated in the melody line) is a dissonant substitute for the more predictable VI (E7) that would normally lead to the ii (Am) chord. Music critic Richie Unterberger considers that this &quot;dramatic opening [lyric]&quot; contains &quot;an almost philosophical undertone of humility, acknowledging that the singer needs his woman not just to be happy, but also to be a better person&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unterberger/AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The verse opens on &quot;Here&quot; in the key of G (with simultaneous I (G chord) and melody G note) and moves to a I–ii–iii–IV chord shift (G–Am–Bm–C) through &quot;making each day of the year&quot;. This repeats on &quot;Changing my life with a wave&quot;; but immediately after (in bar 5) the song changes on &quot;of her hand&quot;. It goes down six semitones from the IV (C chord) to a vii (Fm) [adding a non-G scale C] then a V-of-vi (B7) chord [adding a non-G scale D] which briefly modulates towards a new tonic E minor. McCartney mostly sings a B note (&quot;of her hand&quot;) over both Fm, where it is the eleventh, and the B7, where it is the tonic. When the sequence is repeated (&quot;nobody can&quot;), McCartney sings both B and C over the Fm, the C natural producing a tritone.

During the bridge segment beginning &quot;I want her everywhere&quot;, the key centre shifts via an F7 chord (a VII in the old G key and a V7 in the new B key) to a I–vi–ii (B–Gm–Cm) chord progression in B major. It then shifts again via a D7 chord (a III7 in the old B key and a V7 in the new Gm key) to G minor where there is a i–iv (Gm–Cm chord) progression. Finally, the pivot of D7 takes the scale back to the G major tonic and reinforcing G melody note of &quot;Everywhere&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has noted: &quot;The tune&#x27;s chord sequence bears Brian Wilson&#x27;s influence, ambling through three related keys without ever fully settling into one, and the modulations – particularly the one on the line &#x27;changing my life with a wave of her hand&#x27; – deftly underscore the lyrics, inspired by McCartney&#x27;s girlfriend, actress Jane Asher.&quot;

==Recording==
The Beatles recorded &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; towards the end of the sessions for their 1966 album &quot;Revolver&quot;. The band worked on the song at Abbey Road Studios over three session dates – on 14, 16 and 17 June. Before carrying out overdubs, they taped 13 takes before achieving a satisfactory basic track.

The recording is noted for its layered backing vocals, which McCartney, Lennon and George Harrison spent much of the three days attempting to perfect. McCartney mentioned in the 1989 radio series &quot;McCartney on McCartney&quot; that the vocals were meant to have a Beach Boys sound; he has also said that he was trying to sing it in the style of Marianne Faithfull. McCartney&#x27;s lead vocal on the recording is multi-tracked. In his book &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, Ian MacDonald also comments on Harrison&#x27;s lead guitar part being given a mandolin-like tone via a Leslie speaker effect, before it adopts a &quot;horn-like timbre&quot; for the song&#x27;s ending.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; was released in August 1966 as the fifth track on &quot;Revolver&quot;, sequenced between Harrison&#x27;s Indian-styled &quot;Love You To&quot;, and the children&#x27;s song &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. Writing of its positioning in the running order, music critic Tim Riley says that &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; &quot;domesticates&quot; the &quot;eroticisms&quot; of &quot;Love You To&quot;, and he praises the composition as &quot;the most perfect song&quot; that McCartney had written up to that point. In his review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger describes &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; as one of its author&#x27;s &quot;outstanding contribution[s]&quot; to the genre of &quot;love ballads&quot;, and a song with &quot;the sound of an instant standard&quot;. Unterberger comments on the recording: &quot;The delicacy of the execution is exquisite, the sensual imagery more explicit, the sense of desire and fulfillment tangible.&quot;

Less impressed, Ian MacDonald admired the &quot;ingenuity of the music&quot;, but concluded that &quot;for all its soft-focus charm, the song&#x27;s overall effect is chintzy and rather cloying.&quot; In his chapter on &quot;Revolver&quot; in the book &quot;The Album&quot;, James Perone describes &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; as a &quot;mid 1960s love ballad that could find its way into the set list for bands at a senior prom&quot; and a track that to some listeners appears &quot;syrupy and mushy&quot;. Chris Coplan of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; pairs it with &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot; as songs that are &quot;seemingly out of place&quot; on &quot;Revolver&quot; amid the overtly psychedelic and experimental music that typifies the album.

In his authorised biography, &quot;Many Years from Now&quot;, McCartney names &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; as one of his personal favourites. Beatles producer George Martin also highlighted it among his favourite McCartney songs. Lennon reportedly told McCartney that &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; was &quot;the best tune&quot; on &quot;Revolver&quot;. In a 1980 interview for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, Lennon described it as &quot;one of my favourite songs of the Beatles&quot;.

In 2000, &quot;Mojo&quot; placed &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; at number 4 on its list of the greatest songs of all time. In April 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 25th out of the &quot;100 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;. Art Garfunkel described the song as &quot;intoxicating&quot;: &quot;If music can be defined as that which perfumes the atmosphere, then ‘Here, There and Everywhere’ does it like no other single I’ve ever heard. It’s supreme.&quot;

McCartney re-recorded the song for his 1984 soundtrack album &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot; and also performed it for MTV in 1991, released on &quot;Unplugged (The Official Bootleg).&quot;

==Cover versions==
Unterberger highlights Emmylou Harris among the notable artists who have recorded &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;. Harris&#x27; version became a minor hit in 1976, reaching number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 13 on the Adult Contemporary chart in the United States. It reached number 30 in the Official UK music chart. Frank Ocean interpolated its lyrics on his song &quot;White Ferrari&quot; in 2016 (from the album &quot;Blonde&quot;), for which Lennon–McCartney received a writing credit.

Bruce Welch of the Shadows claimed in his autobiography that McCartney offered the tune to Shadows lead guitarist Hank Marvin before the Beatles&#x27; recording. Marvin eventually released an instrumental version of the song on his 2007 album &quot;Guitar Man&quot;.

Lennon&#x27;s son Sean and Elvis Costello both covered the song in 2022 in celebration of McCartney&#x27;s 80th birthday.

Pat Metheny recorded a solo guitar version for his 2024 album MoonDial.

==In popular culture==
In the TV series &quot;Friends&quot;, this song is played on steel drums when Phoebe Buffay walks down the aisle during her wedding. It was the second time a song written by McCartney was used in a wedding sequence in the series, the first being &quot;My Love&quot; when Chandler and Monica married.

Gary Sparrow sings the song at the piano in an episode of &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot;.

Geoff Emerick, who engineered many of the Beatles&#x27; recordings, used the title of the song for his 2006 memoir &quot;Here, There, and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of The Beatles&quot;.

<doc id="335370" wikidata="Q2074149" url="?curid=335370" title="For No One">
<text>&quot;For No One&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1966 album &quot;Revolver&quot;. It was written by Paul McCartney, and credited to Lennon–McCartney. An early example of baroque pop drawing on both baroque music and nineteenth-century art song, it describes the end of a romantic relationship. Mostly performed by McCartney, the track is distinguished by its French horn line performed by Alan Civil, played first as a solo and then as counterpoint in the final verse. It was considered one of McCartney&#x27;s most mature compositions to date on its release.

==Writing and recording==
McCartney recalls writing &quot;For No One&quot; in the bathroom of a ski resort in the Swiss Alps while on holiday with his then girlfriend Jane Asher; &quot;I suspect it was about another argument,&quot; he later recalled. The lyrics end enigmatically with the line &quot;A love that should have lasted years&quot;. The song&#x27;s working title was &quot;Why Did It Die?&quot; The composition is built on a descending scale progression in B major with a refrain that modulates to C-sharp minor.

The song was recorded on 9, 16 and 19 May 1966. McCartney sang and played clavichord (rented from George Martin&#x27;s AIR company), piano and bass guitar, while Ringo Starr played drums, tambourine and maracas. Neither John Lennon nor George Harrison contributed to the recording.

The French horn solo was by Alan Civil, a British horn player described by recording engineer Geoff Emerick as the &quot;best horn player in London&quot;. During the session, McCartney pushed Civil to play a note that was beyond the usual range of the instrument. According to Emerick, the result was the &quot;performance of his life&quot;. Civil said that the song was &quot;recorded in rather bad musical style, in that it was &#x27;in the cracks&#x27; [not in concert pitch], neither B-flat nor B-major. This posed a certain difficulty in tuning my instrument.&quot; Civil is one of the few session musicians to receive credit on a Beatles album.

==Reception==
In her contemporaneous review of &quot;Revolver&quot;, for &quot;The Evening Standard&quot;, Maureen Cleave highlighted &quot;For No One&quot; among McCartney&#x27;s contributions and deemed it &quot;as moving as &#x27;Yesterday&#x27;&quot;.

Thomas Ward of AllMusic describes &quot;For No One&quot; as &quot;one of Paul McCartney&#x27;s great ballads with the Beatles&quot;, adding that it is &quot;a simply beautiful song, full of idiosyncratic McCartney touches yet undeniably inspired&quot;. Ward praises McCartney&#x27;s vocal performance and calls the song&#x27;s melody &quot;one of the most inspired of the singer&#x27;s whole career&quot;. Ward also admires the bass line and French horn solo, and concludes his review by calling the song &quot;one of the most delicate and fine ballads of the Beatles&#x27; entire canon&quot;.

Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writes that McCartney&#x27;s songs on &quot;Revolver&quot; &quot;[had] a new caustic realism&quot;. He calls &quot;For No One&quot; the &quot;ultimate &#x27;you stay home, she goes out&#x27; break-up song&quot;. Lennon called the song &quot;one of [his] favourites of [McCartney&#x27;s]&quot; and &quot;a nice piece of work.&quot;

Elvis Costello named it his favourite Beatles song, stating in an interview, For No One&#x27; is everything that&#x27;s great about Paul McCartney in one song ... It&#x27;s a really beautiful melody. He&#x27;s like a fantastic movie actor who doesn&#x27;t do anything. He doesn&#x27;t over-dramatize.&quot; Costello went on to call it McCartney&#x27;s best lyric and lauded the song&#x27;s arrangement, concluding, &quot;It&#x27;s about as perfect a record as you could make.&quot;

<doc id="335373" wikidata="Q242608" url="?curid=335373" title="Kathleen Hanna">
<text>Kathleen Hanna (born November 12, 1968) is an American singer, musician and pioneer of the feminist punk riot grrrl movement, and punk zine writer. She is the lead singer of feminist punk band Bikini Kill and fronted the electropunk band Le Tigre in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 2010, she has recorded as the Julie Ruin.

In 2009, Hanna made her zines, art pieces, photography, video, music, journals, and other material which focus on the early formation of the Riot Grrrl movement available at the Fales Library at New York University. A documentary film about Hanna was released in 2013 by director Sini Anderson, titled &quot;The Punk Singer&quot;, detailing Hanna&#x27;s life and career, as well as revealing her years-long battle with Lyme disease. Hanna is married to Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys.

==Life and career==
===1968–1988: Early life and feminism===
Hanna was born November 12, 1968, in Portland, Oregon. At age three, her family moved to Calverton, Maryland; as Hanna&#x27;s father changed occupations, the family moved several more times.
Hanna first became interested in feminism around the age of nine, after her mother took her to a rally in Washington, D.C. where feminist icon Gloria Steinem spoke. In a 2000 interview with &quot;BUST&quot; magazine, Hanna recalled: &quot;My mom was a housewife and wasn&#x27;t somebody that people would think of as a feminist, and when &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine came out we were incredibly inspired by it. I used to cut pictures out of it and make posters that said &#x27;Girls can do anything&#x27;, and stuff like that, and my mom was inspired to work at a basement of a church doing anti-domestic violence work. Then she took me to the Solidarity Day thing, and it was the first time I had ever been in a big crowd of women yelling, and it really made me want to do it forever.&quot;

Hanna&#x27;s interest grew when her mother checked out a copy of Betty Friedan&#x27;s &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; from the library. Their involvement in the women&#x27;s rights movement was done quietly during Hanna&#x27;s childhood, due to her father&#x27;s disapproval.

Upon her parents&#x27; divorce, Hanna returned to Portland and attended Lincoln High School and Grant High School. After high school, she relocated from Portland to Olympia, Washington, to attend The Evergreen State College in the late 1980s. During this time she worked as a stripper to pay her tuition. &quot;My parents didn&#x27;t go to college. I felt lucky [to attend].&quot; While at Evergreen, with fellow student and photographer Aaron Baush-Greene, she set up a photo exhibit featuring the pair&#x27;s photography, which dealt with sexism, violence against women, and AIDS – issues that were heightened for Hanna when she volunteered for SafePlace, a domestic violence organization. However, the school administrators took the photos down before they had the chance to be viewed, an act of censorship that prompted what Hanna refers to as her &quot;first foray into activism&quot;: the creation of Reko Muse, an independent feminist art gallery, with friends Heidi Arbogast and Tammy Rae Carland.

Hanna began doing spoken word performances that addressed sexism and violence against women. Eventually, she abandoned spoken word in favor of music after a conversation with one of her favorite writers, countercultural icon Kathy Acker. Hanna recalled,

Hanna then formed a band with Arbogast and Carland, called &quot;Amy Carter&quot;, which put on shows before the art exhibitions.

===1989–1999: Bikini Kill===

Later, Hanna started another band called Viva Knievel that toured the United States for two months before disbanding. Upon returning to Olympia in 1990, Hanna began collaborating with Evergreen student, drummer and punk zinester Tobi Vail after seeing a performance of the Go Team (a band made up of Vail, Billy Karren, and Calvin Johnson) and recognizing Vail as the mastermind behind the fanzine &quot;Jigsaw&quot; that Hanna greatly admired and loved. In October 1990, Hanna and Vail joined with Karren and bassist Kathi Wilcox to form Bikini Kill, which soon became part of the seminal early-1990s Olympia, Washington music scene. One goal of the band was to inspire more women to join the male-dominated punk scene. While Bikini Kill were in Washington, D.C. during summer 1991, Hanna recorded with two side projects, which were featured on the compilation cassette &quot;A Wonderful Treat&quot;: Suture (with Sharon Cheslow and Dug E. Bird), and Wondertwins (with Tim Green of Nation of Ulysses). Bikini Kill, Suture, and Wondertwins all performed at the International Pop Underground Convention in August 1991.

Bikini Kill&#x27;s first release for the Kill Rock Stars label was a self-titled EP produced by Ian MacKaye of Fugazi. Bikini Kill then toured the UK, recording a split LP with UK band Huggy Bear. This tour was filmed and the band was interviewed by Lucy Thane for her documentary, &quot;It Changed My Life: Bikini Kill in the UK&quot;. Upon returning to the U.S., the band began working with Joan Jett, who produced their single &quot;New Radio/Rebel Girl&quot;. After the single&#x27;s release, Hanna began co-writing songs with Jett for her new album. At the same time, Hanna recorded her spoken-word &quot;Rockstar&quot;, released on a 7-inch single in the Kill Rock Stars &quot;Wordcore&quot; series; and &quot;I Wish I Was Him&quot;, which appears on the KRS compilation &quot;Rock Stars Kill&quot;. The song, written by Ben Lee about alternative rock heartthrob Evan Dando, was originally recorded by Lee&#x27;s band Noise Addict.

The first two Bikini Kill EPs were released on CD as &quot;The C.D. Version of the First Two Records&quot; in 1993. The band released two more full-length albums, &quot;Pussy Whipped&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Reject All American&quot; in 1996, and in 1998, Kill Rock Stars released &quot;Bikini Kill: The Singles&quot;, a collection of the group&#x27;s seven-inch and compilation tracks. Bikini Kill amicably disbanded in mid-1998.

===2000–present: Le Tigre and the Julie Ruin===
After Bikini Kill&#x27;s breakup, Hanna began working on a solo project called Julie Ruin. The project was created entirely in Hanna&#x27;s bedroom using a $40 drum machine. One self-titled album was released under the Julie Ruin pseudonym, and was partially inspired by the work of feminist theorist Julia Kristeva.

Hanna said of the project:

While in Portland, Oregon, Hanna began working with friend and then-zine editor Johanna Fateman on a live show for Julie Ruin. The collaboration resulted in the two briefly forming a band called the Troublemakers, named after a G. B. Jones film, which ended when Fateman relocated to New York City to attend art school.

Hanna soon moved to New York City, and with the addition of filmmaker Sadie Benning, they started another band called Le Tigre based upon a more electronic style of music, similar to the sampler-driven sound Hanna had begun to explore with Julie Ruin. (She later revealed to &quot;Bust&quot; magazine that she was &quot;totally broke&quot; at this time and ate oatmeal daily.) Hanna refers to it as part of a &quot;Punk Feminist Electronic genre&quot;. The band recorded for the Mr. Lady Records label, its first recording being an eponymous album which included the singles &quot;Hot Topic&quot; and &quot;Deceptacon.&quot; Benning then left the band and was replaced by JD Samson for their second album, &quot;Feminist Sweepstakes&quot;.

Mr. Lady Records folded, and the group switched to Universal Records for the 2004 release of &quot;This Island&quot;. Hanna left the band in 2005 due to illness; she was later diagnosed with late-stage Lyme disease. According to the Le Tigre website, during her time off from the band, Hanna volunteered as a band coach for the Willie Mae Rock and Roll Camp for Girls. She also taught an art class at NYU&#x27;s graduate school in the Fall 2007 semester and attended interior design classes. In 2010, Hanna DJed at the Museum of Modern Art, later joining the Raincoats on stage to cover the Slits&#x27; &quot;Vindictive&quot;.

Also in 2010, Hanna announced she was rebuilding her 1997 act Julie Ruin, turning it into a full band called the Julie Ruin with Kenny Mellman and Kathi Wilcox, and that they would be creating a new record. The band played their first show at Knitting Factory in New York City which included songs from Bikini Kill and Le Tigre, and one new composition. From 2010 to 2013, director Sini Anderson worked on a documentary on Kathleen Hanna titled &quot;The Punk Singer&quot;, documenting her works from Bikini Kill to the Julie Ruin. It premiered at SXSW in 2013. In June 2013, Julie Ruin released its first single, &quot;Oh Come On&quot;. An album, &quot;Run Fast&quot; was released in September 2013 with the band going on tour. The band cancelled the tour planned for May to September 2014 due to Hanna&#x27;s Lyme disease deteriorating. She has since recovered and begun performing again. The Julie Ruin&#x27;s second album, &quot;Hit Reset&quot;, was published in July 2016 by Hardly Art.

==Activism and impact==
Hanna&#x27;s outspoken feminism has always influenced her work. She became a voice for third-wave feminism and the Riot Grrrl movement in 1991. In 1991, Bikini Kill spent the summer in Washington, D.C., where Hanna began collaborating with Allison Wolfe, Molly Neuman, and Jen Smith from the band Bratmobile on the zine &quot;Riot grrrl&quot;, which became a call to action for young women to embrace feminism and equal female involvement in the punk rock scene.

The zines &quot;cover[ed] strategies for safety in the mosh pit&quot;, &quot;exploration of political ideas&quot;, and creating a collective for punk feminist women. The Bikini Kill Zine, which began in 1991, was born from this, along with the desire to present &quot;feminist issues through a punk rock lens.&quot; By Issue Two, the Riot Grrrl Manifesto was born, urging women to defy society&#x27;s expectations upon them as women, and to form a collective for women to freely discuss current issues. While Hanna never sought nor intended to become the spokeswoman for Riot Grrl, she hoped that it would provide a voice for issues that are relevant to women on local, national, and global levels.

At Bikini Kill concerts, Hanna would ask women to move to the front of the stage to avoid harassment from males, as part of her idea of &quot;girls to the front&#x27; or &quot;Revolution Girl Style Now.&quot; In a mostly male-dominated punk rock scene where shows often turned violent because of mosh pits (where women were often assaulted), Hanna wanted space for women to be able to feel safe. Additionally, with a barrier of girls in the front rows, she too could feel safe and supported at her own shows, where male hecklers were constantly present.

Her feminist contributions to punk music are also evident in her lyrics. In an interview with Nicole Brodeur from &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, it is said that, &quot;Hanna&#x27;s lyrics were about girls who did and wore what they wanted, despite societal expectations.&quot; Hanna: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not a feminist because you expose your legs.&quot; She zeroed in on the idea that women should have the ability to express themselves in any way they please, without backlash, and her performances regularly reflected such themes. Bradeur: &quot;Hanna exposed her breasts and rear-end with lust-killing bluntness; she wore a girlish ponytail and danced around with &#x27;slut&#x27; written in lipstick across her midriff.&quot;

In 1991, Hanna performed with Bikini Kill (alongside Fugazi) at the Pro-Choice Rally at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. before the &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; trial. Having had an abortion herself at 15, Hanna said: &quot;It&#x27;s about women not dying in back-alley abortions, but it&#x27;s also about women saying: &#x27;My life is worth it, too. I deserve to have control over my life and my health care.&#x27; Imagine if a man was told, &#x27;You can&#x27;t make the decision to have a vasectomy.&#x27;&quot; Hanna also spoke at the 2011 Planned Parenthood &quot;Stand Up for Women&#x27;s Health&quot; Rally. During her speech, she told her story of when she was 19 years old, on tour, and broke. She had acquired an infection, was extremely ill, and walked into a Planned Parenthood clinic for help. Despite having less than $10 in her pocket, she was &quot;met with open arms&quot; at the clinic, was treated with respect, and received medical care.

Hanna contributed the piece &quot;Gen X Survivor: From Riot Grrrl Rock Star to Feminist Artist&quot; to the 2003 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women&#x27;s Anthology for a New Millennium&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan. The riot grrrl genre, to which Hanna was central, has been credited as a historical site for the empowerment of women by such documentaries as &quot;The Punk Singer&quot;, which credits Hanna with having molded many tenets of third-wave feminism.

In 2009, the Fales Library at New York University created a Riot Grrrl Collection which focuses on the early formation of the Riot Grrrl movement, and has a series of zines, art pieces, photography, video, music, journals, and more. Some of Hanna&#x27;s solo work, along with zines that she has created with Bikini Kill and other collaborators are also included. The Bikini Kill archive is also available online.

In a 2014 interview with Amy Middleton of Australian webzine &quot;Archer&quot;, Hanna stated that she supported marriage equality. Hanna also noted that while on tour with Le Tigre, she met teenagers who had told her of starting LGBT groups and gay/straight alliances in their high schools; she said, &quot;Hearing that made me feel so hopeful for the future&quot;. In the same interview, Hanna stated she was saddened by trans-exclusionary feminist movements, and appeared to support transfeminism. Previously, critics had suggested Hanna was trans-exclusionary for having performed at the Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival in 2001 and 2005, which had a policy of exclusively allowing &quot;womyn-born-womyn&quot; into the event.

In 2018, Hanna started &quot;Tees 4 Togo&quot;, a project which sells t-shirts with drawings of Hanna&#x27;s friends such as Kim Gordon, Patton Oswalt, Joan Jett, and Chuck D, along with artists such as Sarah Larnach, Adee Roberson, and Hannah Lucy. 100% of the proceeds go to the non-profit Peace Sisters, which helps fund local girls&#x27; school tuition costs in Dapaong, Togo. The cost of one $40 shirt funds an entire school year for a student.

==Personal life==
Hanna was identified as bisexual in a 1993 &quot;Out&quot; article, while a 2013 Pride.com article described her as &quot;a vocal ally of the gay community&quot;. In 2006, Hanna married Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys. Hanna and Horovitz were reported in 2024 to be living in Pasadena, California, with their ten-year-old son.

Hanna suffered from Lyme disease for six years before it was correctly diagnosed. The disease forced her to enter a three-month course of treatment in 2014, resulting in canceling live performances with her band the Julie Ruin. In 2013 in &quot;Bust&quot; magazine she revealed that Horovitz &quot;took care of me throughout the whole thing.&quot; By June 2015, she described herself as in remission.

==In popular culture==
* Hanna was the source of the name for Nirvana&#x27;s 1991 breakthrough single &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, having written &quot;Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; on Kurt Cobain&#x27;s wall. At the time, Cobain was unaware that Hanna was referring to a deodorant marketed specifically to young women, and thought that the phrase would anchor the song&#x27;s theme.
* The NOFX song &quot;Kill Rock Stars,&quot; from the album &quot;So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes&quot;, is written about Hanna, referencing her by name: &quot;Kill the rockstars? How ironic, Kathleen. You&#x27;ve been crowned the newest queen.&quot; The song&#x27;s title is a reference to Bikini Kill&#x27;s label, Kill Rock Stars.
*She appears in the music video for Sonic Youth&#x27;s song &quot;Bull in the Heather&quot;.
*She collaborated with Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez for the 1990s style sitcom intro theme song in the Marvel Studios series &quot;WandaVision&quot;.
*Hanna appears twice in the 2020 documentary film &quot;The Go-Go&#x27;s&quot; that premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and was broadcast on Showtime later that year. In it, she recalls attending a Go-Go&#x27;s concert in 1982 and the impact it had on her.

<doc id="335375" wikidata="Q640978" url="?curid=335375" title="The Long and Winding Road">
<text>&quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1970 album &quot;Let It Be&quot;. It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon–McCartney. When issued as a single in May 1970, a month after the Beatles&#x27; break-up, it became the group&#x27;s 20th and final number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the United States.

The main recording of the song took place in January 1969 and featured a sparse musical arrangement of piano, bass, guitar and percussion. When preparing the tapes from these sessions for release in April 1970, producer Phil Spector added orchestral and choral overdubs. Spector&#x27;s modifications angered McCartney to the point that when he made his case in the English High Court for the dissolution of the Beatles&#x27; legal partnership, McCartney cited the treatment of the song as one of six reasons justifying the split. Later versions of the recording with simpler instrumentation were subsequently released by the Beatles.

==Inspiration==

Paul McCartney said he came up with the title &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road &quot;stretching up into the hills&quot; in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merritt/SH&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles&#x27; history. McCartney recalled: &quot;I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.&quot;

Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; during one of the recording sessions for &quot;The Beatles&quot;. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones&#x27; recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue &quot;Without Love&quot; as a single.

The composition takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as &quot;slightly jazzy&quot; and in keeping with Charles&#x27; style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duca/HuffPost&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The song&#x27;s home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack/Notes&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The opening theme is repeated throughout. The song lacks a traditional chorus, and the melody and lyrics are ambiguous about the opening stanza&#x27;s position in the piece. In this way, according to musicologist Alan Pollack, it is unclear whether the song has just begun, is in the verse, or is in the bridge.

In a 1994 interview, McCartney said of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it&#x27;s a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It&#x27;s a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.&quot; He also told his biographer Barry Miles in the 1990s that the song was &quot;all about the unattainable; the door you never quite reach ... the road that you never get to the end of&quot;.

==Recording==
===January 1969===
McCartney premiered &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; on 7 January 1969 during the Beatles&#x27; filmed rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios. After they abandoned thoughts of returning to public performance, and instead decided to make a new album, the band recorded several takes of the song at their Apple Studio in central London on 26 January and again on 31 January. The line-up was McCartney on lead vocals and piano, John Lennon on six-string bass guitar, George Harrison on electric guitar played with a Leslie speaker effect, Ringo Starr on drums, and guest keyboardist Billy Preston on electric piano. Lennon, who rarely played bass, made several mistakes on the recording.

As seen in the &quot;Get Back&quot; documentary, following the 26 January recording session, the band discussed the possibility of adding an orchestral accompaniment to the song. &quot;The only way I&#x27;ve ever heard it in my head,&quot; McCartney said, &quot;is like Ray Charles&#x27;s band... We were planning to do it anyway for a couple of numbers, just to have a bit of brass and a bit of strings.&quot; George Harrison supported the idea of a brass accompaniment: &quot;It would be nice with some brass just doing the sustaining chord thing, moving and just holding notes.&quot;

In May 1969, Glyn Johns, who had been asked by the Beatles to compile and mix the &quot;Get Back&quot; album from the sessions, selected the 26 January recording. The 31 January take, which had slightly different lyrics and was recorded with Johns in an unofficial producer&#x27;s role, was used in the film, subsequently titled &quot;Let It Be&quot;.

===April 1970===
In early 1970, Lennon and Harrison asked the Beatles&#x27; manager, Allen Klein, to turn over the January 1969 recordings to American producer Phil Spector, in the hope of salvaging an album to accompany the &quot;Let It Be&quot; documentary film. McCartney had become estranged from his bandmates at this time, due to his opposition to Klein&#x27;s appointment as manager. Several weeks were lost before McCartney replied to messages requesting his approval for Spector to begin working on the recordings. Spector chose to return to the same 26 January recording of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;.

Spector made various changes to the songs. His most dramatic embellishments occurred on 1 April 1970, the last ever Beatles recording session, when he added orchestral overdubs to &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and &quot;I Me Mine&quot; at EMI Studios. The only member of the Beatles present was Starr, who played drums with the session musicians to create Spector&#x27;s characteristic Wall of Sound. Already known for his eccentric behaviour in the studio, Spector was in a peculiar mood that day, according to balance engineer Peter Bown: &quot;He wanted tape echo on everything, he had to take a different pill every half-hour and had his bodyguard with him constantly. He was on the point of throwing a wobbly, saying &#x27;I want to hear this, I want to hear that. I must have this, I must have that.&#x27;&quot; The orchestra became so annoyed by Spector&#x27;s behaviour that the musicians refused to play any further; at one point, Bown left for home, forcing Spector to telephone him and persuade him to return after Starr had told Spector to calm down.

Spector nonetheless succeeded in overdubbing &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, using eight violins, four violas, four cellos, three trumpets, three trombones, two guitars, and a choir of fourteen women. The orchestra was scored and conducted by Richard Hewson, a young London arranger who had worked with Apple artists Mary Hopkin and James Taylor. This lush orchestral treatment was in direct contrast to the Beatles&#x27; stated intentions for a &quot;real&quot; recording when they began work on &quot;Get Back&quot;.

On 2 April, Spector sent each of the Beatles an acetate of the completed album with a note saying: &quot;If there is anything you&#x27;d like done to the album, let me know and I&#x27;ll be glad to help ... If you wish, please call me about anything regarding the album tonight.&quot; All four Beatles, including McCartney, sent Spector a telegram giving their approval.

==Dispute over Spector&#x27;s overdubs==
According to author Peter Doggett, McCartney had felt the need to accommodate his bandmates when accepting Spector&#x27;s version of &quot;Let It Be.&quot; However, following his announcement of the Beatles&#x27; break-up in a press release accompanying the release of his debut solo album, &quot;McCartney&quot;, on 9 April, he became dissatisfied with Spector&#x27;s additions, particularly on &quot;The Long and Winding Road.&quot; On 14 April, with manufacturing underway for &quot;Let It Be&quot;, he sent a terse letter to Klein, demanding that the harp be removed from the song and that the other added instrumentation and voices be reduced. McCartney concluded the letter with the words: &quot;Don&#x27;t ever do it again.&quot; Klein attempted to phone McCartney but he had changed his number without informing Apple; Klein then sent a telegram asking McCartney to contact him or Spector about his concerns. According to Klein, &quot;The following day, a message was relayed to me [from McCartney] that the letter spoke for itself.&quot; With &quot;Let It Be&quot; scheduled for release in advance of the film, Klein allowed the production process to continue with Spector&#x27;s version of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; intact.

In an interview published by the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in two parts on 21 and 22 April 1970, McCartney said:
The album was finished a year ago, but a few months ago American record producer Phil Spector was called in by John Lennon to tidy up some of the tracks. But a few weeks ago, I was sent a re-mixed version of my song &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; with harps, horns, an orchestra and women&#x27;s choir added. No one had asked me what I thought. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I would never have female voices on a Beatles record.
The band&#x27;s usual producer, George Martin, called the remixes &quot;so uncharacteristic&quot; of the Beatles. Johns, who was denied a production credit by Lennon, later described Spector&#x27;s embellishments as &quot;revolting ... just puke&quot;.

McCartney asked Klein to dissolve the Beatles&#x27; partnership, but was refused. Outraged, he took the case to the High Court in London in early 1971, naming Klein and the other Beatles as defendants. Among the six reasons McCartney gave for dissolving the Beatles was that Klein&#x27;s company, ABKCO, had imposed changes to &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; without consulting McCartney. In his written affidavit, Starr countered this statement by saying that when Spector had sent acetates of &quot;Let It Be&quot; to each of the Beatles for their approval, with a request also for feedback: &quot;We all said yes. Even at the beginning Paul said yes. I spoke to him on the phone, and said, &#x27;Did you like it?&#x27; and he said, &#x27;Yeah, it&#x27;s OK.&#x27; He didn&#x27;t put it down.&quot; Starr added: &quot;And then suddenly he didn&#x27;t want it to go out. Two weeks after that, he wanted to cancel it.&quot; Author Nicholas Schaffner commented that, in light of McCartney&#x27;s contention in the High Court, it was surprising that he personally accepted the band&#x27;s Grammy Award for &quot;Let It Be&quot; in March 1971 – when the album won in the category Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Special – and that he chose to feature his wife Linda&#x27;s voice so prominently on his post-Beatles recordings.

Speaking to music journalist Richard Williams soon after the overdubbing sessions, Spector said that he had asked whether any of the Beatles would like to help him produce the album, but none of them had wanted to.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvin/Mojo&quot;&gt; Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; He later said he was forced into orchestrating &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; to cover the poor quality of Lennon&#x27;s bass playing; Spector also denied that McCartney was not consulted, saying that he had first contacted McCartney about the choice of musical arranger. In his book &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, Beatles scholar Ian MacDonald wrote: &quot;The song was designed as a standard to be taken up by mainstream balladeers ... It features some atrocious bass-playing by Lennon, prodding clumsily around as if uncertain of the harmonies and making many comical mistakes. Lennon&#x27;s crude bass playing on &#x27;The Long and Winding Road&#x27;, though largely accidental, amounts to sabotage when presented as finished work.&quot; In 2003, Spector called McCartney&#x27;s criticism &quot;hypocritical&quot;, alleging that &quot;Paul had no problem picking up the Academy Award for the &quot;Let It Be&quot; movie soundtrack, nor did he have any problem in using my arrangement of the string and horn and choir parts when he performed it during 25 years of touring on his own. If Paul wants to get into a pissing contest about it, he&#x27;s got me mixed up with someone who gives a shit.&quot;

==Release==
The song was released on the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album on 8 May 1970. On 11 May, only one week before the album&#x27;s North American release, Apple issued &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; as a single in the United States with &quot;For You Blue&quot; on the B-side. The single was released in several European countries but not the United Kingdom. In the context of the recent news regarding the Beatles&#x27; split, the song captured the sadness that many listeners felt.

In the US, &quot;For You Blue&quot; gained sufficient radio airplay for &quot;Billboard&quot; to chart the two songs together, as a double-sided hit. The record was similarly listed as a double A-side when it topped Canada&#x27;s singles chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canada/BB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 June 1970, it became the Beatles&#x27; twentieth and final number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and held the top position for a second week. The band thereby set the all-time record for number of chart-topping singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The Beatles achieved this feat in a period of less than six and a half years, starting with &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; on 1 February 1964, during which they topped the Hot 100 in one out of every six weeks. &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; also topped the US charts compiled by &quot;Cash Box&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot;, giving the band their 22nd and 23rd number-one hits on those charts.

The single had a relatively brief run on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and its contemporary US sales were insufficient for gold accreditation by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In February 1999, &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA for sales of 1,000,000.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Let It Be&quot; received largely unfavourable reviews from music critics, many of whom ridiculed Spector&#x27;s use of orchestration, particularly on &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;. In his album review for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Richard Williams wrote that &quot;Paul&#x27;s songs seem to be getting looser and less concise, and Spector&#x27;s orchestrations add to the Bacharach atmosphere. The strings add a pleasant fullness in places, but intrude badly near the end and the harps are too much.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s reviewer, John Mendelsohn, was especially critical of Spector&#x27;s work, saying: &quot;He&#x27;s rendered &#x27;The Long and Winding Road&#x27; ... virtually unlistenable with hideously cloying strings and a ridiculous choir that serve only to accentuate the listlessness of Paul&#x27;s vocal and the song&#x27;s potential for further mutilation at the hands of the countless schlock-mongers who will undoubtedly trip all over one another in their haste to cover it.&quot; Mendelsohn said that while the song was a &quot;slightly lesser chapter in the ongoing story of McCartney as facile romanticist&quot;, &quot;it might have eventually begun to grow on one as unassumingly charming&quot; without Spector&#x27;s &quot;oppressive mush&quot;.

In 1973, musicologist and critic Wilfrid Mellers wrote: &quot;The music has a tremendous expectancy ... Whether or not Paul approved of the plush scoring of &#x27;The Long and Winding Road&#x27;, it works not because it guys the feeling but because the feeling has integrity.&quot; MacDonald said: &quot;With its heart-breaking suspensions and yearning backward glances from the sad wisdom of the major key to the lost loves and illusions of the minor, &#x27;The Long and Winding Road&#x27; is one of the most beautiful things McCartney ever wrote. Its words, too, are among his most poignant, particularly the reproachful lines of the brief four-bar middle section. A shame Lennon didn&#x27;t listen more generously.&quot;

According to Williams, writing in his book &quot;Phil Spector: Out of His Head&quot;, Spector&#x27;s mistake was in &quot;taking McCartney at his face value&quot; and emphasising the sentimental qualities that George Martin&#x27;s orchestral arrangements for the Beatles had successfully tempered. Williams added: &quot;Some might say that this track, above all others, epitomises Paul McCartney, and that when Spector sent the saccharine strings sweeping in after the first line of vocal, he was merely highlighting the reality.&quot; In a 2003 review for &quot;Mojo&quot;, shortly after the announcement that McCartney planned to issue &quot;a string-less &quot;Let It Be&quot;&quot;, John Harris opined: &quot;As someone who experiences a Proustian rush every time the orchestra crash-lands in &#x27;The Long and Winding Road&#x27;, I can only implore him to think again. Besides, underneath all the Wagnerian gloop, John&#x27;s bass playing is &quot;horribly&quot; out of tune ...&quot; Referring to the version subsequently released without the controversial overdubs, Adam Sweeting of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the song was &quot;indubitably improved by the removal of Spector&#x27;s wall of schmaltz&quot; but &quot;still teeth-clenchingly mawkish&quot;.

In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; at number 90 on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;. On a similar list compiled by &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2006, the song appeared at number 27. In his commentary for the magazine, Brian Wilson described it as his &quot;all time favourite Beatles track&quot;, saying that while the Beatles were &quot;genius songwriters&quot;, this song was distinguished by a &quot;&quot;heart-and-soul&quot; melody&quot;. Wilson concluded: &quot;When they broke up I was heartbroken. I think they should have kept going.&quot;

==Other Beatles and McCartney versions==
Since the original release in 1970, there have been six additional recordings released by McCartney. After he had resisted playing any of his Beatles songs with his band Wings, he included &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; in the set list for Wings&#x27; 1975–76 world tour. A live version appeared on the 1976 album &quot;Wings over America&quot;.

McCartney re-recorded &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; for the soundtrack to his 1984 film &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot;. George Martin produced the track, which includes saxophone accompaniment and what authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter describe as a Las Vegas-style musical arrangement. A second new studio recording of the song was made by McCartney in 1989 and used as a B-side of single releases from his &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot; album, starting with the &quot;Postcard Pack&quot; vinyl format of &quot;This One&quot;.

On McCartney&#x27;s 1989–90 world tour in support of &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot; – his first world tour since 1975–76 – the song was performed with a musical backing that, in Kenneth Womack&#x27;s view, &quot;clearly attempts to replicate&quot; the strings added by Spector in 1970. The version released on the live album from the tour, &quot;Tripping the Live Fantastic&quot;, was the only song taken from McCartney&#x27;s two April 1990 shows at the Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. The single also included non-album live tracks &quot;C Moon&quot; and &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot;. The live single version was also included on &quot;The 7&quot; Singles Box&quot; in 2022.

The 1996 Beatles&#x27; outtakes compilation &quot;Anthology 3&quot; includes the original 26 January 1969 take, without Spector&#x27;s overdubs. &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; provided the working title for Apple executive Neil Aspinall&#x27;s early version of the documentary film that became the 1995 TV series &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;. The title was changed in the 1990s after Harrison objected to the project being named after McCartney&#x27;s song.

In 2003, McCartney persuaded Starr and Ono (as Lennon&#x27;s widow) to release &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot;. McCartney said that his long-standing dissatisfaction with the released version of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; was partly the impetus for the new version. The album included a take of the song from 31 January 1969. With no strings or other added instrumentation, it was closer to the Beatles&#x27; original intention than the 1970 version. This take is also the one seen in the film &quot;Let It Be&quot; and on the Beatles&#x27; 2015 video compilation &quot;1&quot;. Starr said of the &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; version: &quot;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with Phil&#x27;s strings [on the 1970 release], this is just a different attitude to listening. But it&#x27;s been 30-odd years since I&#x27;ve heard it without all that and it just blew me away.&quot;

&quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; has continued to be a staple of McCartney&#x27;s post-Beatles concert repertoire. In July 2005, he performed the song to close the Live 8 concert in London. On his 2009 tours, McCartney played it as part of a nostalgia-filled set that included tributes to Linda, Lennon and Harrison. In the case of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, the performance was accompanied by screen-projected photos taken by Linda of the family&#x27;s Arizona ranch, including the horse trail she and McCartney rode shortly before her death.

==Cover versions==
&quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; was one of several McCartney compositions from the Beatles era that became widely covered by easy listening artists and persuaded adults that the younger generation&#x27;s musical tastes had merit. A version by Bud Shank with the Bob Alcivar Singers was released in March 1970 on the album &quot;Let It Be&quot;, which preceded the Beatles&#x27; version by two months (released in May on their twelfth album &quot;Let It Be&quot;). A version by British singer Ray Morgan reached number 32 on the UK Singles Chart in 1970.

As McCartney had originally envisaged, Ray Charles recorded a cover version in 1971, released on &quot;Volcanic Action of My Soul&quot;. A &quot;live&quot; vocal of Ray, as described in the liner notes to &quot;Ray Sings, Basie Swings&quot;, was later overdubbed with the Count Basie Orchestra and issued on that 2006 album. Aretha Franklin released a recording of the song on her 1972 album &quot;Young, Gifted and Black&quot;, a version that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Rob Sheffield calls &quot;the greatest of all Beatle covers&quot;. Cilla Black released a version on her 1973 Martin-produced album &quot;Day by Day with Cilla&quot;; McCartney described this recording as the definitive version of the song.

Other versions include a cover by Leo Sayer on the 1976 &quot;All This and World War II&quot; soundtrack, a 1978 recording by Peter Frampton for Robert Stigwood&#x27;s film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, a 1999 performance by George Michael at the Royal Albert Hall memorial concert for Linda McCartney, and a 2010 performance at the White House by Faith Hill when Barack Obama gave McCartney the Gershwin Prize. In 1985, a recording by Billy Ocean peaked at number 24 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Contemporary chart. In 2002, British &quot;Pop Idol&quot; series one contestants Will Young and Gareth Gates recorded a version released as a double A-side with Gates&#x27; version of &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;; the single topped the UK Singles Chart and the Scottish Singles Chart. The duet by itself also reached number 4 in Ireland.

After winning series 13 of &quot;The Voice UK&quot; in 2024, English singer AVA released a cover of the song, which peaked at No. 5 in the UK.

<text>RS-422, also known as TIA/EIA-422, is a technical standard originated by the Electronic Industries Alliance, first issued in 1975, that specifies electrical characteristics of a digital signaling circuit. It was meant to be the foundation of a suite of standards that would replace the older RS-232C standard with standards that offered much higher speed, better immunity from noise, and longer cable lengths. RS-422 systems can transmit data at rates as high as 10 Mbit/s, or may be sent on cables as long as at lower rates. It is closely related to RS-423, which uses the same signaling systems but on a different wiring arrangement.

RS-422 specifies differential signaling, with every data line paired with a dedicated return line. It is the voltage difference between these two lines that defines the mark and space, rather than, as in RS-232, the difference in voltage between a data line and a local ground. As the ground voltage can differ at either end of the cable, this required RS-232 to use signals with voltage magnitudes greater than 5 volts. Moving to dedicated return lines and always defining ground in reference to the sender allows RS-422 to use 0.4 V, allowing it to run at much higher speeds. RS-423 differs primarily in that it has a single return pin instead of one for each data pin.

==Standard scope==
RS-422 is the common short form title of American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard &quot;ANSI/TIA/EIA-422-B Electrical Characteristics of Balanced Voltage Differential Interface Circuits&quot; and its international equivalent &quot;ITU-T Recommendation T-REC-V.11&quot;, also known as &quot;X.27&quot;. These technical standards specify the electrical characteristics of the balanced voltage digital interface circuit. RS-422 provides for data transmission, using balanced, or differential, signaling, with unidirectional/non-reversible, terminated or non-terminated transmission lines, point to point, or multi-drop. In contrast to EIA-485, RS-422/V.11 does not allow multiple drivers but only multiple receivers.

The first version of RS-422 was issued in 1975, with revision A issued in December 1978. Revision B, published in May 1994 was reaffirmed by the Telecommunications Industry Association in 2005.

== Characteristics ==
Several key advantages offered by this standard include the differential receiver, a differential driver and data rates as high as 10 megabits per second at 12 meters (40 ft). Since the signal quality degrades with cable length, the maximum data rate decreases as cable length increases. Figure A.1 in the annex plotting this stops at 10 Mbit/s.

The maximum cable length is not specified in the standard, but guidance is given in its annex. (This annex is not a formal part of the standard, but is included for information purposes only.) Limitations on line length and data rate vary with the parameters of the cable length, balance, and termination, as well as the individual installation. Figure A.1 shows a maximum length of , but this is with a termination, and the annex discusses the fact that many applications can tolerate greater timing and amplitude distortion, and that experience has shown that the cable length may be extended to several kilometers. Conservative maximum data rates with 24AWG UTP (POTS) cable are 10 Mbit/s at to 90 kbit/s at , as shown in the figure A.1. This figure is a conservative guide based on empirical data, not a limit imposed by the standard.

RS-422 specifies the electrical characteristics of a single balanced signal. The standard was written to be referenced by other standards that specify the complete DTE/DCE interface for applications that require a balanced voltage circuit to transmit data. These other standards would define protocols, connectors, pin assignments and functions. Standards such as EIA-530 (DB-25 connector) and EIA-449 (DC-37 connector) use RS-422 electrical signals. Some RS-422 devices have 4 screw terminals for pairs of wire, with one pair used for data in each direction.

RS-422 cannot implement a true multi-point communications network, such as with RS-485, since there can be only one driver on each pair of wires. However, one driver can fan-out to up to ten receivers.

RS-422 can interoperate with interfaces designed to MIL-STD-188-114B, but they are not identical. RS-422 uses a nominal 0 to 5-volt signal, while MIL-STD-188-114B uses a signal symmetric about 0 V. However, the tolerance for common-mode voltage in both specifications allows them to interoperate. Care must be taken with the termination network.

RS-423 is a similar specification for unbalanced signaling.

When used in relation to communications wiring, RS-422 wiring refers to cable made of 2 sets of twisted pair, often with each pair being shielded, and a ground wire. While a double-pair cable may be practical for many RS-422 applications, the RS-422 specification only defines one signal path and does not assign any function to it. Any complete cable assembly with connectors should be labeled with the specification that defined the signal function and mechanical layout of the connector, such as RS-449.

== Applications ==
One of the most widespread uses of RS-422 was on the early Macintosh computers. This was implemented in a multi-pin connector that had enough pins to support the majority of the common RS-232 pins; the first models used a 9-pin D connector, but this was quickly replaced by a mini-DIN-8 connector starting with the Macintosh Plus. The ports could be put into either RS-232 or RS-422 mode, which changes the behavior of some of the pins while turning others on or off completely. These connectors are used to support RS-232 devices like modems, AppleTalk networking, RS-422 printers, and other peripherals. Two such ports were part of early Apple Macintosh series designs until they were replaced, along with ADB ports, by Universal Serial Bus on the iMac in 1998.

RS-422 is a common transport mechanism for RS-232 extenders. These consist of RS-232 ports on either end of an RS-422 connection.

Before hard-disk-based playout and editing systems were used, broadcast automation systems and post-production linear editing facilities used RS-422A to remotely control the players/recorders located in the central apparatus room. In most cases, the Sony 9-pin connection was used, which makes use of a DE-9 connector. This is the de facto industry standard connector for RS-422, which is still found on broadcast equipment today.

<text>Cortisol is a steroid hormone in the glucocorticoid class of hormones and a stress hormone. When used as medication, it is known as hydrocortisone.

It is produced in many animals, mainly by the &quot;zona fasciculata&quot; of the adrenal cortex in an adrenal gland. In other tissues, it is produced in lower quantities. By a diurnal cycle, cortisol is released and increases in response to stress and a low blood-glucose concentration. It functions to increase blood sugar through gluconeogenesis, suppress the immune system, and aid in the metabolism of calories. It also decreases bone formation. These stated functions are carried out by cortisol binding to glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptors inside a cell, which then bind to DNA to affect gene expression.
==Health effects==
=== Metabolic response ===

==== Metabolism of glucose ====

Cortisol plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism and promotes gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis) and glycogenesis (glycogen synthesis) in the liver and glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen) in skeletal muscle. It also increases blood glucose levels by reducing glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue, decreasing protein synthesis, and increasing the breakdown of fats into fatty acids (lipolysis). All of these metabolic steps have the net effect of increasing blood glucose levels, which fuel the brain and other tissues during the fight-or-flight response. Cortisol is also responsible for releasing amino acids from muscle, providing a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Its impact is complex and diverse.

In general, cortisol stimulates gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of &#x27;new&#x27; glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, which occurs mainly in the liver, but also in the kidneys and small intestine under certain circumstances). The net effect is an increase in the concentration of glucose in the blood, further complemented by a decrease in the sensitivity of peripheral tissue to insulin, thus preventing this tissue from taking the glucose from the blood. Cortisol has a permissive effect on the actions of hormones that increase glucose production, such as glucagon and adrenaline.

Cortisol also plays an important, but indirect, role in liver and muscle glycogenolysis (the breaking down of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate and glucose) which occurs as a result of the action of glucagon and adrenaline. Additionally, cortisol facilitates the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, which is necessary for adrenaline to have an effect on glycogenolysis.

It is paradoxical that cortisol promotes not only gluconeogenesis (biosynthesis of glucose molecules) in the liver, but also glycogenesis (polymerization of glucose molecules into glycogen): cortisol is thus better thought of as stimulating glucose/glycogen turnover in the liver. This is in contrast to cortisol&#x27;s effect in the skeletal muscle where glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen into glucose molecules) is promoted indirectly through catecholamines. In this way, cortisol and catecholamines work synergistically to promote the breakdown of muscle glycogen into glucose for use in the muscle tissue.

==== Metabolism of proteins and lipids ====
Elevated levels of cortisol, if prolonged, can lead to proteolysis (breakdown of proteins) and muscle wasting. The reason for proteolysis is to provide the relevant tissue with a feedstock for gluconeogenesis; see glucogenic amino acids. The effects of cortisol on lipid metabolism are more complicated since lipogenesis is observed in patients with chronic, raised circulating glucocorticoid (i.e. cortisol) levels, although an acute increase in circulating cortisol promotes lipolysis. The usual explanation to account for this apparent discrepancy is that the raised blood glucose concentration (through the action of cortisol) will stimulate insulin release. Insulin stimulates lipogenesis, so this is an indirect consequence of the raised cortisol concentration in the blood but it will only occur over a longer time scale.

=== Immune response ===
Cortisol prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation. It is used to treat conditions resulting from overactivity of the B-cell-mediated antibody response. Examples include inflammatory and rheumatoid diseases, as well as allergies. Low-dose topical hydrocortisone, available as a nonprescription medicine in some countries, is used to treat skin problems such as rashes and eczema.

Cortisol inhibits production of interleukin 12 (IL-12), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), IFN-alpha, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T helper cells (Th1 cells), but upregulates interleukin 4, interleukin 10, and interleukin 13 by Th2 cells. This results in a shift toward a Th2 immune response rather than general immunosuppression. The activation of the stress system (and resulting increase in cortisol and Th2 shift) seen during an infection is believed to be a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response.

Cortisol can weaken the activity of the immune system. It prevents proliferation of T-cells by rendering the interleukin-2 producer T-cells unresponsive to interleukin-1, and unable to produce the T-cell growth factor IL-2. Cortisol downregulates the expression of the IL2 receptor IL-2R on the surface of the helper T-cell which is necessary to induce a Th1 &#x27;cellular&#x27; immune response, thus favoring a shift towards Th2 dominance and the release of the cytokines listed above which results in Th2 dominance and favors the &#x27;humoral&#x27; B-cell mediated antibody immune response.

Cortisol also has a negative-feedback effect on IL-1.
The way this negative feedback works is that an immune stressor causes peripheral immune cells to release IL-1 and other cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha. These cytokines stimulate the hypothalamus, causing it to release corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH in turn stimulates the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) among other things in the adrenal gland, which (among other things) increases production of cortisol. Cortisol then closes the loop as it inhibits TNF-alpha production in immune cells and makes them less responsive to IL-1.

Through this system, as long as an immune stressor is small, the response will be regulated to the correct level. Like a thermostat controlling a heater, the hypothalamus uses cortisol to turn off the heat once the production of cortisol matches the stress induced on the immune system. But in a severe infection or in a situation where the immune system is overly sensitized to an antigen (such as in allergic reactions) or there is a massive flood of antigens (as can happen with endotoxic bacteria) the correct set point might never be reached. Also because of downregulation of Th1 immunity by cortisol and other signaling molecules, certain types of infection, (notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis) can trick the body into getting locked in the wrong mode of attack, using an antibody-mediated humoral response when a cellular response is needed.

Lymphocytes include the B-cell lymphocytes that are the antibody-producing cells of the body, and are thus the main agents of humoral immunity. A larger number of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and skin means the body is increasing its humoral immune response. B-cell lymphocytes release antibodies into the bloodstream. These antibodies lower infection through three main pathways: neutralization, opsonization, and complement activation. Antibodies neutralize pathogens by binding to surface adhering proteins, keeping pathogens from binding to host cells. In opsonization, antibodies bind to the pathogen and create a target for phagocytic immune cells to find and latch onto, allowing them to destroy the pathogen more easily. Finally antibodies can also activate complement molecules which can combine in various ways to promote opsonization or even act directly to lyse a bacteria. There are many different kinds of antibody and their production is highly complex, involving several types of lymphocyte, but in general lymphocytes and other antibody regulating and producing cells will migrate to the lymph nodes to aid in the release of these antibodies into the bloodstream.

Rapid administration of corticosterone (the endogenous type I and type II receptor agonist) or RU28362 (a specific type II receptor agonist) to adrenalectomized animals induced changes in leukocyte distribution.

On the other side of things, there are natural killer cells; these cells have the ability to take down larger in size threats like bacteria, parasites, and tumor cells. A separate study found that cortisol effectively disarmed natural killer cells, downregulating the expression of their natural cytotoxicity receptors. Prolactin has the opposite effect. It increases the expression of cytotoxicity receptors on natural killer cells, increasing their firepower.

Cortisol stimulates many copper enzymes (often to 50% of their total potential), including lysyl oxidase, an enzyme that cross-links collagen and elastin. Especially valuable for immune response is cortisol&#x27;s stimulation of the superoxide dismutase, since this copper enzyme is almost certainly used by the body to permit superoxides to poison bacteria.

Some viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, are known to suppress the secretion of stress hormones to avoid the organism&#x27;s immune response, thus avoiding the immune protection of the organism. These viruses suppress cortisol by producing a protein that mimics the human ACTH hormone but is incomplete and does not have hormonal activity. ACTH is a hormone that stimulates the adrenal gland to produce cortisol and other steroid hormones. However, the organism makes antibodies against this viral protein, and those antibodies also kill the human ACTH hormone, which leads to the suppression of adrenal gland function. Such adrenal suppression is a way for a virus to evade immune detection and elimination. This viral strategy can have severe consequences for the host (human that is infected by the virus), as cortisol is essential for regulating various physiological processes, such as metabolism, blood pressure, inflammation, and immune response. A lack of cortisol can result in a condition called adrenal insufficiency, which can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Adrenal insufficiency can also impair the ability of the host to cope with stress and infections, as cortisol helps to mobilize energy sources, increase heart rate, and downregulate non-essential metabolic processes during stress. Therefore, by suppressing cortisol production, some viruses can escape the immune system and weaken the host&#x27;s overall health and resilience.

==Other effects==
=== Metabolism ===
==== Glucose ====
Cortisol counteracts insulin, contributes to hyperglycemia by stimulating gluconeogenesis and inhibits the peripheral use of glucose (insulin resistance) by decreasing the translocation of glucose transporters (especially GLUT4) to the cell membrane. Cortisol also increases glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) in the liver, storing glucose in easily accessible form.

==== Bone and collagen ====
Cortisol reduces bone formation, favoring long-term development of osteoporosis (progressive bone disease). The mechanism behind this is two-fold: cortisol stimulates the production of RANKL by osteoblasts which stimulates, through binding to RANK receptors, the activity of osteoclasts – cells responsible for calcium resorption from bone – and also inhibits the production of osteoprotegerin (OPG) which acts as a decoy receptor and captures some RANKL before it can activate the osteoclasts through RANK. In other words, when RANKL binds to OPG, no response occurs as opposed to the binding to RANK which leads to the activation of osteoclasts.

It transports potassium out of cells in exchange for an equal number of sodium ions (see above). This can trigger the hyperkalemia of metabolic shock from surgery. Cortisol also reduces calcium absorption in the intestine. Cortisol down-regulates the synthesis of collagen.

==== Amino acid ====
Cortisol raises the free amino acids in the serum by inhibiting collagen formation, decreasing amino acid uptake by muscle, and inhibiting protein synthesis. Cortisol (as opticortinol) may inversely inhibit IgA precursor cells in the intestines of calves. Cortisol also inhibits IgA in serum, as it does IgM; however, it is not shown to inhibit IgE.

=== Electrolyte balance ===
Cortisol increases glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow from the kidneys thus increasing phosphate excretion, as well as increasing sodium and water retention and potassium excretion by acting on mineralocorticoid receptors. It also increases sodium and water absorption and potassium excretion in the intestines.

==== Sodium ====
Cortisol promotes sodium absorption through the small intestine of mammals. Sodium depletion, however, does not affect cortisol levels so cortisol cannot be used to regulate serum sodium. Cortisol&#x27;s original purpose may have been sodium transport. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that freshwater fish use cortisol to stimulate sodium inward, while saltwater fish have a cortisol-based system for expelling excess sodium.

==== Potassium ====
A sodium load augments the intense potassium excretion by cortisol. Corticosterone is comparable to cortisol in this case. For potassium to move out of the cell, cortisol moves an equal number of sodium ions into the cell. This should make pH regulation much easier (unlike the normal potassium-deficiency situation, in which two sodium ions move in for each three potassium ions that move out—closer to the deoxycorticosterone effect).

=== Stomach and kidneys ===
Cortisol stimulates gastric-acid secretion. Cortisol&#x27;s only direct effect on the hydrogen-ion excretion of the kidneys is to stimulate the excretion of ammonium ions by deactivating the renal glutaminase enzyme.

===Memory===
Cortisol works with adrenaline (epinephrine) to create memories of short-term emotional events; this is the proposed mechanism for storage of flash bulb memories, and may originate as a means to remember what to avoid in the future. However, long-term exposure to cortisol damages cells in the hippocampus; this damage results in impaired learning.

=== Diurnal cycles ===

Diurnal cycles of cortisol levels are found in humans.

=== Stress ===
Sustained stress can lead to high levels of circulating cortisol (regarded as one of the more important of the several &quot;stress hormones&quot;).

=== Effects during pregnancy ===
During human pregnancy, increased fetal production of cortisol between weeks 30 and 32 initiates production of fetal lung pulmonary surfactant to promote maturation of the lungs. In fetal lambs, glucocorticoids (principally cortisol) increase after about day 130, with lung surfactant increasing greatly, in response, by about day 135, and although lamb fetal cortisol is mostly of maternal origin during the first 122 days, 88% or more is of fetal origin by day 136 of gestation. Although the timing of fetal cortisol concentration elevation in sheep may vary somewhat, it averages about 11.8 days before the onset of labor. In several livestock species (e.g. cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs), the surge of fetal cortisol late in gestation triggers the onset of parturition by removing the progesterone block of cervical dilation and myometrial contraction. The mechanisms yielding this effect on progesterone differ among species. In the sheep, where progesterone sufficient for maintaining pregnancy is produced by the placenta after about day 70 of gestation, the prepartum fetal cortisol surge induces placental enzymatic conversion of progesterone to estrogen. (The elevated level of estrogen stimulates prostaglandin secretion and oxytocin receptor development.)

Exposure of fetuses to cortisol during gestation can have a variety of developmental outcomes, including alterations in prenatal and postnatal growth patterns. In marmosets, a species of New World primates, pregnant females have varying levels of cortisol during gestation, both within and between females. Infants born to mothers with high gestational cortisol during the first trimester of pregnancy had lower rates of growth in body mass indices than infants born to mothers with low gestational cortisol (about 20% lower). However, postnatal growth rates in these high-cortisol infants were more rapid than low-cortisol infants later in postnatal periods, and complete catch-up in growth had occurred by 540 days of age. These results suggest that gestational exposure to cortisol in fetuses has important potential fetal programming effects on both pre and postnatal growth in primates.

===Cortisol face===

Increased cortisol levels may lead to facial swelling and bloating, creating a round and puffy appearance, referred to as &quot;cortisol face.&quot;

==Synthesis and release==
Cortisol is produced in the human body by the adrenal gland&#x27;s zona fasciculata, the second of three layers comprising the adrenal cortex. This cortex forms the outer &quot;bark&quot; of each adrenal gland, situated atop the kidneys. The release of cortisol is controlled by the hypothalamus of a brain. Secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus triggers cells in its neighboring anterior pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) into the vascular system, through which blood carries it to the adrenal cortex. ACTH stimulates the synthesis of cortisol and other glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoid aldosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone.

== Testing of individuals ==
Normal values indicated in the following tables pertain to humans (normal levels vary among species). Measured cortisol levels, and therefore reference ranges, depend on the sample type, analytical method used, and factors such as age and sex. Test results should, therefore, always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that produced the result. An individual&#x27;s cortisol levels can be detected in blood, serum, urine, saliva, and sweat.

Using the molecular weight of 362.460 g/mole, the conversion factor from μg/dL to nmol/L is approximately 27.6; thus, 10 μg/dL is about 276 nmol/L.

Cortisol follows a circadian rhythm, and to accurately measure cortisol levels is best to test four times per day through saliva. An individual may have normal total cortisol but have a lower than normal level during a certain period of the day and a higher than normal level during a different period. Therefore, some scholars question the clinical utility of cortisol measurement.

Cortisol is lipophilic, and is transported bound to transcortin (also known as corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)) and albumin, while only a small part of the total serum cortisol is unbound and has biological activity. This binding of cortisol to transcortin is accomplished through hydrophobic interactions in which cortisol binds in a 1:1 ratio. Serum cortisol assays measures total cortisol, and its results may be misleading for patients with altered serum protein concentrations. The salivary cortisol test avoids this problem because only free cortisol can pass through the blood-saliva barrier. Transcortin particles are too large to pass through this barrier, that consists of epithelial cell layers of the oral mucosa and salivary glands.

Cortisol may be incorporated into hair from blood, sweat, and sebum. A 3 centimeter segment of scalp hair can represent 3 months of hair growth, although growth rates can vary in different regions of the scalp. Cortisol in hair is a reliable indicator of chronic cortisol exposure.

Automated immunoassays lack specificity and show significant cross-reactivity due to interactions with structural analogs of cortisol, and show differences between assays. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) can improve specificity and sensitivity.

== Disorders of cortisol production ==
Some medical disorders are related to abnormal cortisol production, such as:
* Primary hypercortisolism (Cushing&#x27;s syndrome): excessive levels of cortisol
** Secondary hypercortisolism (pituitary tumor resulting in Cushing&#x27;s disease, pseudo-Cushing&#x27;s syndrome)
* Primary hypocortisolism (Addison&#x27;s disease, Nelson&#x27;s syndrome): insufficient levels of cortisol
** Secondary hypocortisolism (pituitary tumor, Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome)

== Regulation ==
The primary control of cortisol is the pituitary gland peptide, ACTH, which probably controls cortisol by controlling the movement of calcium into the cortisol-secreting target cells. ACTH is in turn controlled by the hypothalamic peptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is under nervous control. CRH acts synergistically with arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, and epinephrine. (In swine, which do not produce arginine vasopressin, lysine vasopressin acts synergistically with CRH.)

When activated macrophages start to secrete IL-1, which synergistically with CRH increases ACTH, T-cells also secrete glucosteroid response modifying factor (GRMF), as well as IL-1; both increase the amount of cortisol required to inhibit almost all the immune cells. Immune cells then assume their own regulation, but at a higher cortisol setpoint. The increase in cortisol in diarrheic calves is minimal over healthy calves, however, and falls over time. The cells do not lose all their fight-or-flight override because of interleukin-1&#x27;s synergism with CRH. Cortisol even has a negative feedback effect on interleukin-1—especially useful to treat diseases that force the hypothalamus to secrete too much CRH, such as those caused by endotoxic bacteria. The suppressor immune cells are not affected by GRMF, so the immune cells&#x27; effective setpoint may be even higher than the setpoint for physiological processes. GRMF affects primarily the liver (rather than the kidneys) for some physiological processes.

High-potassium media (which stimulates aldosterone secretion &quot;in vitro&quot;) also stimulate cortisol secretion from the fasciculata zone of canine adrenals — unlike corticosterone, upon which potassium has no effect.

Potassium loading also increases ACTH and cortisol in humans. This is probably the reason why potassium deficiency causes cortisol to decline (as mentioned) and causes a decrease in conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. This may also have a role in rheumatoid-arthritis pain; cell potassium is always low in RA.

Ascorbic acid presence, particularly in high doses has also been shown to mediate response to psychological stress and speed the decrease of the levels of circulating cortisol in the body post-stress. This can be evidenced through a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and decreased salivary cortisol levels after treatment with ascorbic acid.

=== Factors increasing cortisol levels ===
* Viral infections increase cortisol levels through activation of the HPA axis by cytokines.
* Intense (high VO2 max) or prolonged aerobic exercise transiently increases cortisol levels to increase gluconeogenesis and maintain blood glucose; however, cortisol declines to normal levels after eating (i.e., restoring a neutral energy balance).
* Severe trauma or stressful events can elevate cortisol levels in the blood for prolonged periods.
* Low-carbohydrate diets cause a short-term increase in resting cortisol (≈3 weeks), and increase the cortisol response to aerobic exercise in the short- and long-term.
* Increase in the concentration of ghrelin, the hunger stimulating hormone, increases levels of cortisol.

== Biochemistry ==
=== Biosynthesis ===
Cortisol is synthesized from cholesterol. Synthesis takes place in the zona fasciculata of an adrenal cortex.

The name &quot;cortisol&quot; is derived from the word &#x27;cortex&#x27;. Cortex means &quot;the outer layer&quot;—a reference to the adrenal cortex, the part of the adrenal gland where cortisol is produced.

While the adrenal cortex in humans also produces aldosterone in the zona glomerulosa and some sex hormones in the zona reticularis, cortisol is its main secretion in humans and several other species. In cattle, corticosterone levels may approach or exceed cortisol levels. In humans, the medulla of the adrenal gland lies under its cortex, mainly secreting the catecholamines adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) under sympathetic stimulation.

Synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland is stimulated by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland with ACTH; ACTH production is, in turn, stimulated by CRH, which is released by the hypothalamus. ACTH increases the concentration of cholesterol in the inner mitochondrial membrane, via regulation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. It also stimulates the main rate-limiting step in cortisol synthesis, in which cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone and catalyzed by Cytochrome P450SCC (side-chain cleavage enzyme).

=== Metabolism ===
====11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases====
Cortisol is metabolized reversibly to cortisone by the 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase system (11-beta HSD), which consists of two enzymes: 11-beta HSD1 and 11-beta HSD2. The metabolism of cortisol to cortisone involves oxidation of the hydroxyl group at the 11-beta position.

====A-ring reductases (5alpha- and 5beta-reductases)====
Cortisol is also metabolized irreversibly into 5-alpha tetrahydrocortisol (5-alpha THF) and 5-beta tetrahydrocortisol (5-beta THF), reactions for which 5-alpha reductase and 5-beta-reductase are the rate-limiting factors, respectively. 5-Beta reductase is also the rate-limiting factor in the conversion of cortisone to tetrahydrocortisone.

====Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A monooxygenases====
Cortisol is also metabolized irreversibly into 6β-hydroxycortisol by cytochrome p450-3A monooxygenases, mainly, CYP3A4. Drugs that induce CYP3A4 may accelerate cortisol clearance.

==Chemistry==
Cortisol is a naturally occurring pregnane corticosteroid and is also known as 11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione.

==Animals==
In animals, cortisol is often used as an indicator of stress and can be measured in blood, saliva, urine, hair, and faeces.

<text>The New England Evangelical Baptist Fellowship (NEEBF) was organized in Kennebunk, Maine on January 2, 1844¹. In 2001, there were 10 churches located in Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire with a possible membership of 600. The NEEBF holds quarterly sessions. They have thirteen articles of faith, advocating beliefs which include the inspiration of the Bible, the deity of Jesus, general atonement, local church autonomy, and premillennialism. G. Richard Mountfort serves as President (2001).

==Sources==
*&quot;Encyclopedia of American Religions&quot;, J. Gordon Melton, editor
*&quot;For Your Enrichment&quot; (a brochure of the NEEBF)
*&quot;Profiles in Belief: the Religious Bodies of the United States and Canada&quot;, by Arthur Carl Piepkorn

==Footnotes==
# &quot;Profiles in Belief&quot; is apparently in error when it says that the &quot;New England Evangelical Baptist Fellowship&quot; was organized in the 1940s by Congregational-Christian Churches that preferred not to become a part of the United Church of Christ. Perhaps this group was confused with the &quot;National Association of Congregational Christian Churches&quot;. The Fellowship&#x27;s brochure gives the 1844 organizational date.</text><links>
