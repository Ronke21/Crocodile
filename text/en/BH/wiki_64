<text>GO Transit is a regional public transit system serving the Greater Golden Horseshoe region of Ontario, Canada. With its hub at Union Station in Toronto, GO Transit&#x27;s green-and-white trains and buses serve a population of more than seven million across an area over stretching from Kitchener in the west to Peterborough in the east, and from Barrie in the north to Niagara Falls in the south. In , the system had a ridership of . GO Transit operates diesel-powered double-decker trains and coach buses, on routes that connect with all local and some long-distance inter-city transit services in its service area.

GO Transit began regular passenger service on May 23, 1967, as a part of the Ontario Ministry of Transportation. Since then, it has grown from a single train line to seven lines. GO Transit has been constituted in a variety of public-sector configurations. Today, it is an operating division of Metrolinx, a provincial Crown agency with overall responsibility for integrative transportation planning within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and is projected to grow dramatically with electrification, increased frequency and new stations through the GO Expansion, which is scheduled to be completed in phases through 2025–2032.
== History ==
=== Early days ===
Cities in and around the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) expanded greatly during the 1950s, influenced by growth in immigration and industrialization. Much of the existing commuter service was provided by the Canadian National Railway (CN), which faced mounting pressure to expand its service beyond the Lakeshore trains it ran between Hamilton in the west and Danforth in the east, to Toronto; however, CN lacked the financial and physical capital to do this. Real improved commuter service was not considered until the 1962 Metropolitan Toronto and Region Transportation Study, which examined land use and traffic in the newly created Metropolitan Toronto. The idea of GO Transit was created out of fear of becoming lost in years of planning; it was &quot;approached as a test, but recognized to be a permanent service&quot;. In May 1965, the government of Ontario granted permission to proceed with the launch of Canada&#x27;s first specially-designed commuter rail service, at a cost of ($ in dollars).

=== Creation, growth and recession ===

Government of Ontario Transit (later shortened to &quot;GO Transit&quot;) started as a three-year long experiment on May 23, 1967, running single-deck trains powered by diesel locomotives in push-pull configuration on a single rail line along Lake Ontario&#x27;s shoreline. GO Train service ran throughout the day from Oakville to Pickering with limited rush hour train service to Hamilton. The experiment proved to be extremely popular; GO Transit carried its first million riders during its first four months, and averaged 15,000 per day soon after. This line, now divided as the Lakeshore East and Lakeshore West lines, is the keystone corridor of GO Transit. Expansion of rail service continued in the 1970s and 1980s, aimed at developing ridership in with the introduction of the Georgetown (now Kitchener) line in 1974 and the Richmond Hill line in 1978. The Milton GO Train line opened in 1981, followed by the Bradford (now Barrie) and Stouffville lines a year later, establishing GO Transit&#x27;s present-day service of seven rail corridors.

Other than establishing new rail corridors, GO Transit introduced the Bombardier BiLevel Coaches in 1979, in order to increase the number of passengers carried per train. These unique rail cars were developed in partnership with Bombardier Transportation. Also in 1979, the former Bay Street GO concourse at Union Station was built to accommodate these additional passengers. GO Bus service began on September 8, 1970, extending the original Lakeshore line to Hamilton and Oshawa, as well as providing service north to Newmarket and Barrie. It eventually became a full-fledged network in its own right after 1989, feeding rail service and serving communities beyond the reach of existing trains.

Near the end of 1982, Ontario Minister of Transportation and Communications James W. Snow announced the launch of GO-ALRT (Advanced Light Rail Transit), an interregional light rail transit program providing $2.6 billion (1980 dollars) of infrastructure. Although this plan was not implemented, certain key objectives from it were established in other ways: additional stations were built, all-day service to Whitby and Burlington was established and networks of buses and trains interconnected the network.

GO extended limited rush hour train service on the Bradford, Georgetown and both Lakeshore lines and began offering off-peak service on the Milton line in 1990. Train service was also extended to Burlington on the Lakeshore West line in 1992. In a series of cost-cutting measures, then–Ontario Premier Bob Rae announced a &quot;temporary&quot; reduction in spending on services, causing all of the expansions of the 1990s to be reduced or eliminated.

=== Reconfiguration and revival ===

All day train service was restored from Burlington to Whitby, and peak service was finally brought to Oshawa in 2000. A large initiative to expand the GO Transit network, under the &quot;GO Transit Rail Improvement Plan&quot;, or &quot;GO TRIP&quot;, started in the mid-2000s. C$1billion was invested in multiple rail and bus projects, making it the largest commuter rail project in Canadian history. This was later dwarfed by a further slate of new GO infrastructure proposed in MoveOntario 2020, the provincial transit plan announced by Premier Dalton McGuinty in the leadup to the 2007 provincial election. With re-investment in regional transit, GO experienced growth in its train network: all day service was restored to Oshawa in 2006 and Aldershot in 2007; service was expanded to Barrie South in 2007, to Lincolnville in 2008, to Kitchener in 2011, to Gormley in 2016, to Bloomington in 2021, and an excursion train operated on summer weekends to Niagara Falls. This service was later expanded to all year round.

GO Transit also went through three major reconfigurations. In January 1997, the province announced it would transfer funding responsibility for GO Transit to GTHA municipalities. The Greater Toronto Services Board, composed of regional municipality chairs, city mayors and municipal councillors, was created as a municipal agency in January 1999, and GO Transit became an arm of this agency in August 1999. However, then-Premier Mike Harris announced the province would re-assume funding responsibility for GO Transit two years later, and this was completed with the abolition of the Greater Toronto Services Board on January 1, 2002. The Greater Toronto Transportation Authority was created in 2006, with the responsibilities of co-ordinating, planning, financing and developing integrated transit in the GTHA. This agency was merged with GO Transit in 2009 under the name Metrolinx. GO Transit continued as an operating division alongside two other major initiatives: the Union Pearson Express and Presto card.

=== Future ===
As part of the 2011 provincial election, Premier Dalton McGuinty made a campaign pledge to provide two-way, full-day train service on all corridors. Metrolinx continues to plan for this service expansion, which is now known as GO Expansion. Part of Metrolinx&#x27;s Big Move regional transportation plan, it is estimated to cost $4.9 billion and serve 30million additional riders by 2031. Other possible future rail service extensions identified in GO Transit&#x27;s 2020 plan include Niagara Region, Bolton, Brantford, Peterborough and Uxbridge. Metrolinx also announced plans in January 2011 to electrify the Lakeshore West, Lakeshore East and Kitchener rail lines, as well as the Union Pearson Express.

In 2021, Metrolinx announced a pilot service to London, Ontario, with one train towards Toronto in the morning and one train returning to London in the evening. At this time, the Presto card cannot be used for such trips and riders must pre-purchase digital tickets in advance.

Improvements are being made to Union Station, which is the busiest passenger transportation facility in Canada, and is expected to have its current passenger traffic double in the next 10 to 15 years. Improvements underway include a new roof and glass atrium covering the platforms and railway tracks, new passenger concourses, additional staircases and vertical access points and general visual improvements to the station. Other longer term options such as a second downtown station and/or connections to a future Relief Subway Line are also being studied to meet future demand.

GO Transit is currently undergoing a major expansion project to improve train service. The project will electrify the Lakeshore East, Barrie, and Stouffville lines, the Lakeshore West line as far as Burlington, the Kitchener line as far as Bramalea, and increase train frequency on various lines to 15 minutes or better on these corridors, with several new stations being built both within Toronto and throughout the GTHA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2022/04/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It will also bring all-day, two-way service to the inner portions of the Barrie, Kitchener and Stouffville lines. GO Transit will increase the number of train trips per week from 1,500 (as of 2015) to about 2,200 by 2020 and expand to 10,500 weekly trips upon completion. Most of the extra trips will be in off-peak hours and on weekends. The expanded services, new infrastructure and electrification is projected to roll out in phases between 2025 and 2030. The 10-year regional express rail plan will cost $13.5 billion and will require of new track, including new bridges and tunnels.

Starting January 1, 2025, the consortium ONxpress will take over the operation and maintenance from Alstom of the GO Transit train system in addition to introducing the improvements required for GO Expansion. ONxpress has a division named ONxpress Operations Inc. which consists of Deutsche Bahn International Operations and Aecon Concessions.
== Service ==
=== Service area ===

GO Transit primarily serves the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area–the cities of Toronto and Hamilton and the surrounding regions of Halton, Peel, York and Durham. GO Transit&#x27;s lines extend into the nearby Niagara and Waterloo Regions, the cities of Brantford and Peterborough, and Simcoe, Dufferin and Wellington counties—an area largely coextensive with the Greater Golden Horseshoe. Under the provincial charter, GO Transit is permitted to serve cities elsewhere in Ontario, but has no plans of doing so.

In total, GO trains and buses serve a population of 7million in an area radiating in places more than from downtown Toronto. Present extrema are Brantford and Kitchener to the west; Orangeville, Barrie to the north; Peterborough and Newcastle to the east; and Niagara Falls to the south.

The GO system map shows seven train lines (or corridors), all departing from Toronto&#x27;s Union Station and mostly named respectively after the outer terminus (or former terminus) of train service:
: Lakeshore West (to Hamilton and Niagara Falls, with buses to Brantford)
: Lakeshore East (to Oshawa, with buses to Bowmanville and Peterborough)
: Milton
: Kitchener
: Barrie
: Richmond Hill (to Oak Ridges)
: Stouffville (to Lincolnville, with buses to Uxbridge)

Although colours are assigned in a consistent fashion to each line in all official media, in colloquial parlance lines are only ever referred to by their names. Buses are numbered in blocks of 10, corresponding to the nearest train line, with the 40s and 50s reserved for express services along the 407 ETR corridor which does not have a corresponding train line.

=== Operations ===
==== Rail ====

GO Transit&#x27;s commuter rail services carry the large majority of its overall ridership. Until 2012, five GO Train lines operated only during weekday rush hour periods in the peak direction (inbound towards Union Station in the morning and outbound in the afternoons and early evenings), with off-peak service on these routes being provided solely by buses. Since then, hourly off-peak train service or better has been added to 5 of these lines. The present off-peak service is as follows:

*the Lakeshore West and Lakeshore East lines operate half-hourly trains on weekdays off-peak hours and every 15 minutes on weekend afternoons, with weekend service on Lakeshore West extending as far as Niagara Falls. Nearly all trains on the two lines are through-routed, making it possible to travel between Aldershot (or Niagara Falls) and Oshawa without having to change trains at Union Station.
*the Kitchener line provides hourly, two-way midday and late evening service as far as Mount Pleasant station in Brampton on weekdays only, with two off-peak weekday trains going all the way to Kitchener. On weekends, two-way hourly service is provided as far as Mount Pleasant only.
*the Barrie line has all-day weekday and weekend train services along the entire line, although most of them only go as far as Aurora
*the Stouffville line has hourly midday and late evening service as far as Mount Joy on weekdays only and hourly weekend service in both directions

The Richmond Hill and Milton lines continue to operate during rush hours only, although there has been an increasing number of trips on these lines in recent years. As part of the Regional Express Rail plan, there are plans to eventually offer two-way, all-day 15-minute or better service on the central sections of the remaining five lines. Nevertheless, rush-hour service accounts for over 90 per cent of GO Train ridership.

===== Rolling stock =====
GO Transit&#x27;s rolling stock uses push-pull equipment. Its passenger car fleet is composed entirely of Bombardier BiLevel Coaches built in Thunder Bay, Ontario. These double-decker coaches, which have an elongated-octagon shape, were designed in the mid-1970s for GO Transit by Hawker Siddeley Canada as a more efficient replacement for GO&#x27;s original single-deck coaches, built by the same company. Later coaches were manufactured by Can-Car/UTDC and the most recent coaches are produced by Bombardier Transportation and since acquired by Alstom, which now owns the designs and manufacturing facilities. GO Transit owns 979 BiLevel Coaches. This type of coach is also used by a number of other commuter railways across North America. They have a seating capacity of 162 and a standing capacity of 248 per coach, or 5,256 per train (maximum crush load). All upper levels of the coaches on rush hour trains are designated &quot;Quiet Zones&quot;.
The coaches are primarily hauled by MPI MPXpress series locomotives. The current model, the 4000-horsepower MP40PH-3C, is more powerful than its predecessor, the EMD F59PH. It is capable of pulling or pushing trains of 12 coaches instead of 10. More than 60 of these locomotives have been ordered since their introduction in 2006, with a further 16 types of an even more powerful model, the 5400-horsepower MP54AC, which can pull a full 12 car train more efficiently. Opposite the locomotive, trains are bookended by cab cars, which are coaches with driver controls incorporated into them. GO Transit upgraded their entire cab car rail fleet with newly designed, more crashworthy cab cars in the summer of 2015, incorporating an improved visibility, safety features and comfort for train crews.

Rolling stock is maintained at the Willowbrook Rail Maintenance Facility, located west of Mimico station in Toronto and at the newer Whitby Rail Maintenance Facility. The Willowbrook facility occupies the Willowbrook Yard, a historical freight yard established by Grand Trunk Railway in 1910. GO Transit acquired the yard from Canadian National sometime after its inception, and built and expanded the Willowbrook facility there to maintain the expanding fleet. GO Transit built a second maintenance facility covering in Whitby to accommodate additional trains for its upcoming Regional Express Rail project, and was completed by the end of 2017. A limited number of old cab cars, which resembled standard coaches with the addition of a cab at the end, are still operating, with 15 old cab cars being rebuilt and reintroduced for expanded GO service.

===== Ownership and crews =====

GO has always owned its locomotives and coaches, but its trackage used to be owned entirely by Canada&#x27;s two major commercial railways: the large majority by the Canadian National Railway (CN) and the remainder (the current Milton line) by Canadian Pacific Railway (CP, now CPKC). In 1988, as part of expanding service east of Pickering, GO built its first section of self-owned purpose-built trackage. From 1998 until 2009, GO owned only six per cent of the railway trackage on which it operated. Starting in 2009, Metrolinx incrementally acquired further trackage from the two commercial railways in order to improve GO service. As of 2014, Metrolinx has complete ownership of the Barrie, Stouffville and Lakeshore East lines, and a majority of the Lakeshore West, Richmond Hill, and Kitchener lines. CPKC still owns most of the Milton line. This puts Metrolinx ownership at 69 percent of GO Transit&#x27;s trackage.

Each train runs with a three-person crew: two operators control the train from the cab at the front end of the train and handle related operations, while a third crew member is the Customer Service Ambassador. Stationed in a designated car in the middle of each train, the Customer Service Ambassador operates the doors and wheelchair ramp, makes station stop announcements, and is dedicated to assisting customers on board. Alstom Transport is responsible for providing train operations, taking over from Bombardier Transportation in 2021. GO trains achieve on-time performance of approximately 95 per cent, and a refund will be provided if a train is more than 15 minutes late, with some conditions.

==== Bus ====
GO Bus service consists of a combination of routes, many of which stand in for train service when it is not operating and/or which extend the reach of train service to communities beyond their terminal. Other GO buses are independent of rail services, such as the Highway 407 series of routes, which provides an orbital-type service that encircles Toronto proper and makes connections between all train lines. There are also routes that serve Pearson International Airport and seasonal destinations such as several colleges and universities. The vast majority of GO train stations have connecting GO bus service, of which almost all the exceptions are situated within Toronto proper. There are also 16 bus terminals served by GO buses, many of which provide local transit connections, as well as intermediate stops and ticket agencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;08/09 Report&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The first buses operated by GO Transit, a suburban variant of the GM New Look bus, were unveiled at Queen&#x27;s Park on August 11, 1970, about a month before commencing operations on its expanded services east, west and north of Toronto. Operated by Gray Coach, a pilot program to test them was conducted in Pickering before they entered service on 8 September 1970. Later buses included a combination of single-door, suburban-type transit buses built by Orion Bus Industries and New Flyer, and single-level highway coaches built by Prevost Car and Motor Coach Industries (MCI, now a subsidiary of New Flyer).

Today, GO Transit operates a combination of single-level coach buses and commuter-type double-decker buses. All buses are equipped with bike racks and are wheelchair accessible. Most of the older buses in the fleet are , single-level D4500CT coach buses built by Motor Coach Industries, which can seat 57 people and features a platform lift. The first models of this type entered service in 2001 and orders have continued until 2015. In April 2008, GO began operating Enviro 500 double-decker buses built by British manufacturer Alexander Dennis in the United Kingdom. These buses come in three different designs differing mainly in their size and height. All double deckers have a low-floor design and a wheelchair ramp at the front door.

The first two batches of double deckers have a height of , too tall to meet many height standards set by the provincial Ministry of Transportation. Thus, they are restricted to routes which avoid low bridges and underpasses. In particular, they are found exclusively on routes on the Highway 407 and Highway 403 corridors, providing service between Peel and York Regions.

In 2012, GO ordered new Enviro500 double-decker units for its fleet. Designated as &quot;Go-Anywhere&quot; models, they have a redesigned front end, based on the Enviro400 (and which would later form the basis for the global Enviro500 MMC refreshed design), and a height of , lower than the previous models. The lower height allows these buses to meet many more clearance standards as a result and are used on a wider variety of routes, including those that travel on Highway 401. Three additional batches of &quot;Go-Anywhere&quot; Enviro500s were ordered until 2015.

Despite the lower height, these buses are still too high to fit in a number of GO terminals, namely Hamilton, Yorkdale, York Mills, and Union Station. Beginning in 2016, GO Transit began placing further orders of Enviro500 double-deckers. These buses, designed specifically for the GO Transit network and designated as &quot;Super-Lo&quot;, have an even lower height of , low enough to operate on virtually the entire GO bus network. They also have a longer length than previous orders, being long (the same as its coach buses), and dedicated space for luggage at the rear. The chassis for these vehicles are being locally assembled at a newly established facility in Vaughan, creating up to 30 new full-time jobs.

=== Stations and connections ===

GO Transit stations are designed to provide seamless and barrier-free connections between its trains and buses. They include amenities such as elevators, washrooms, parking, pay phones, ticket vending machines, ticket sale kiosks and automated teller machines. All GO stations have Presto card readers. Most bus terminals are also served with a ticket sales booth or vending machine. As of 2016, the capital costs of building a GO Transit train station is about $50 to $75 million.

Most GO stations include large commuter parking lots, some of which have recently included large parking structures, and also include onsite bus loops for buses making timed connections to GO Buses.

Some GO train stations are shared with Union Pearson Express (commuter train services from Toronto Union Station to Pearson Airport), Via Rail (Canada&#x27;s national passenger rail services) and Amtrak (which offers passenger train service to the United States). GO also connects with fifteen other municipal transit providers, such as the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and York Region Transit (YRT), as well as several long-distance intercity bus services, such as Ontario Northland, Megabus, TOK Coachlines and United States-bound Greyhound Lines services. Metrolinx calls many of these transfer points between services mobility hubs, and it has made them a priority as it moves forward with &quot;The Big Move&quot; regional transportation plan.

=== Ridership ===
On an average weekday, GO runs 322 train trips carrying 206,167 riders, and 2,386 bus trips carrying 48,477 passengers. This adds up to 254,644 passengers throughout the entire system. In 2017, GO Transit ridership totalled 68.5million, and if expansion plans are realized, is projected to total over 200million by 2055.

At least 91 per cent of the train ridership is to and from Union Station in downtown Toronto, while about 70% of all bus passengers travel to and from the City of Toronto. The average trip taken by a passenger is long. Most GO Transit commuters have a private vehicle available to them for their commute, but choose to use GO Transit instead. About 80% of train commuters and 60% of bus commuters choose GO Transit over driving. Over half of GO&#x27;s ridership occurs on the Lakeshore West and East lines, which can be attributed to the almost continuous development along their corridors, as well as being the only two lines with two way, all day service since their inception. This is followed by the Milton line, carrying almost 14% of all ridership. Other corridors carry 4–11% of riders each.

== Fares ==

Fares on the network are based on a zone tariff set between two specified points by GO Transit, and the type of passenger using the ticket. Tickets are sold for single trip, or passes for one day or one month. Tickets can be used on a GO train, bus, or a combination of both. They can be purchased at train stations, bus terminals and ticket agencies. Passenger categories exist for adults, youth, students, seniors and groups. As of March 9, 2019, passengers aged 12 and under can ride GO Transit fare-free.

The Presto card, available on all GO trains and buses, is a unified smart card-based payment system used throughout the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. Presto is a sister operating division of Metrolinx and the card can also be used on numerous local transit agencies in the GTHA such as the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and York Region Transit (YRT) as well as on OC Transpo in Ottawa. As of April 21, 2024, free transfers exist for all connecting local transit systems throughout the GTHA. - in many cases using a Presto card or contactless credit card and their associated mobile wallets (where accepted) - are included with the GO Transit fare.

The Presto system allows passengers to load money on a reloadable card. Passengers pay their fare by &quot;tapping&quot; on and off on busses and trains. With each tap, the system calculates the fare for the ride, and it is deducted from the balance of the card. The card can also be linked to a credit or debit card and set on autoload, so that it automatically adds a certain amount of money as soon as the balance decreases past a certain level.

Since August 11, 2022, contactless credit/debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Interac) &amp; their associated mobile wallets such as Apple and Google Pay have been accepted on GO Transit in which a passenger taps on and off with their credit card on a PRESTO card fare reader. Contactless credit cards can also be used to pay transit fares - by tapping on PRESTO fare readers - across the Greater Toronto Area and are eligible for the free transfer on those supporting transit services providers which is included in the cost of the GO Transit fare (where accepted).

GO Trains use a &quot;proof-of-payment&quot; policy where the fare system is run on an &quot;honour system&quot;. Passengers are required to carry a valid GO paper or digital ticket or pass, a tapped-in credit/debit card/mobile wallet or Presto card to prove that they paid for their fares. Passengers may be subject to random fare inspections at any time during travel. This system is designed to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Enforcement of this system is carried out via Metrolinx&#x27;s By-law No. 2 that, by reference to the &quot;Provincial Offences Act&quot;, imposes a $35 to $200 fine for fare evasion.

Although children ages 0 to 12 years of age can ride fare-free on GO Transit, they may be required to show proof of age when getting a child Presto card.

== Logo ==

The GO Transit logo has remained largely unchanged since the agency was founded. The design was created by Gagnon/Valkus, a Montreal-based design firm that was also responsible for the corporate identities of Canadian National and Hydro-Québec. The firm&#x27;s team wanted to create a unified logo using the initials of the Government of Ontario (&quot;GO&quot;), via two circles with a &quot;T&quot; incorporated into it. Lead designer Frank Fox described the creation of the logo as &quot;a happy accident. More or less, we had this feeling among us that this couldn&#x27;t be true. We went off trying many other solutions, but nothing else was good enough.&quot;

The logo has since become woven into the cityscape of Toronto, and is a prominent identifier of the agency. As one graphic design expert stated, it achieved &quot;an enviable goal that most graphic designers strive to accomplish with any logo they design&quot;. Only one minor revision was made after the original version was unveiled: while the &quot;G&quot; and &quot;O&quot; used to touch each other, a gap now exists with a bolder white &quot;T&quot; to enhance them. The primary corporate colour was known as &quot;GO Green&quot;, matched the green on Ontario Highway signs, and was used on all vehicles, signage, and printed material. In 2013, GO introduced a two-tone colour scheme that changed the primary colour to a darker green, and added a second lighter apple green. The changes were made to better harmonize with the branding of Metrolinx and its other operating divisions, as well as to improve its display digitally.

== Safety and security ==
=== By-law No. 2 ===
GO Transit By-law No. 2 is a document of rules and regulations governing actions of passengers and employees while on GO Transit property, which includes land, facilities, trains, buses and other structures. Besides issues relating to fares, the by-law specifies permissible and prohibited actions such as staying in designated safe areas, commercial or distribution activities, parking and other personal actions that promote or endanger the safety of passengers. It covers items like paying fares, parking, general behaviour, fines and rule enforcement. These rules can be enforced by a &quot;proper authority&quot; which is defined as &quot;an employee or agent of GO Transit wearing a GO Transit uniform [or] carrying an identification card issued by GO Transit, a GO Transit Special Constable, or a municipal police officer&quot;. Any contravention of the by-law can result in a fine under the &quot;Provincial Offences Act&quot;.

=== Enforcement ===

GO Transit employs Transit Safety Officers, who are designated special constables that patrol Metrolinx properties, and are responsible for ensuring passenger safety and protection, enforcing relevant laws or by-laws, offering customer assistance and supporting local police, fire and ambulance, and promoting railway safety. Under the &quot;Police Services Act&quot;, Transit Safety Officers are appointed by the Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police, with approval from the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services. In addition to By-law No. 2, they have the authority to enforce other certain federal and provincial laws.

GO Transit also employs Provincial Offences Officers, known as Revenue Protection Officers, to enforce the proof-of-payment system. GO Transit operates a 24-hour Transit Safety Communications centre operated by Communications Operators. They are mainly responsible for taking calls from the public with regards to actionable complaints, dispatching special constables or relevant emergency services to all areas serviced by Metrolinx.

=== Incidents ===
On December 12, 1975, a westbound GO train collided with a Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) bus that was stalled on a crossing at St. Clair and Midland Avenue. Nine passengers on the bus were killed and 20 others were injured. This was the worst accident in terms of loss of life in the history of the TTC and GO Transit systems. The level crossing was replaced by an overpass a few years later.

On November 17, 1997, an empty train collided with another train waiting to depart Union Station with over 800 passengers on board. The empty train&#x27;s locomotive engineer was at the opposite end of the train, and the conductor at the leading end failed in his attempts to relay the situation to the engineer or apply the emergency brake. The two trains then collided at a speed of , causing a partial derailment and minor injuries to fifty-four passengers and two crew members. The subsequent Transportation Safety Board report made recommendations, including making emergency brakes more accessible and that the locomotive engineer must always control the train from the leading end in the Union Station Rail Corridor.

On July 8, 2013, a Richmond Hill–bound GO train encountered flash flooding in the Don Valley when a record-breaking 123 mm rain storm fell over a few hours in Toronto area. As the crew worked to reverse the direction of the train back to Union Station, flood waters continued to rise and submerged the entire track and the train itself began to flood. Approximately 1,400 passengers on board had to be rescued by boat.

On January 14, 2015, a GO bus on Highway 407 near Weston Road hit a guard rail and rolled into a ditch. One passenger was ejected and crushed to death, and another two in addition to the bus driver were injured. On March 2, 2015, the GO Transit driver was charged with careless driving causing death.

<text>A discordant coastline occurs where bands of different rock types run perpendicular to the coast.

The differing resistance to erosion leads to the formation of headlands and bays. A hard rock type such as granite is resistant to erosion and creates a promontory whilst a softer rock type such as the clays of Bagshot Beds is easily eroded creating a bay.

Part of the Dorset coastline running north from the Portland limestone of Durlston Head is a clear example of a discordant coastline. The Portland limestone is resistant to erosion; then to the north there is a bay at Swanage where the rock type is a softer greensand. North of Swanage, the chalk outcrop creates the headland which includes Old Harry Rocks.

The converse of a discordant coastline is a concordant coastline.

<text>The Siegfried Line, known in German as the &quot;Westwall (= western bulwark)&quot;, was a German defensive line built during the late 1930s. Started in 1936, opposite the French Maginot Line, it stretched more than from Kleve on the border with the Netherlands, along the western border of Nazi Germany, to the town of Weil am Rhein on the border with Switzerland. The line featured more than 18,000 bunkers, tunnels and tank traps.

From September 1944 to March 1945, the Siegfried Line was subjected to a large-scale Allied offensive.

== Name ==
The official German name for the defensive line construction program before and during the Second World War changed several times during the late 1930s. It came to be known as the &quot;Westwall&quot;, but in English it was referred to as the &quot;Siegfried Line&quot; or, sometimes, the &quot;West Wall&quot;. Various German names reflected different areas of construction:

* Border Watch programme (pioneering programme) for the most advanced positions (1938)
* Limes programme (1938)
* Western Air Defense Zone (1938)
* Aachen–Saar programme (1939)
* Geldern Emplacement between Brüggen and Kleve (1939–1940)

The programmes were given the highest priority, putting a heavy demand on the available resources.

The origin of the name &quot;Westwall&quot; is unknown, but it appeared in popular use from the middle of 1939. There is a record of Hitler sending an Order of the Day to soldiers and workers at the &quot;Westwall&quot; on 20 May 1939.

== History ==

=== Minor early role ===
At the start of World War II, the Siegfried Line had serious weaknesses. After the war, German General Alfred Jodl said that it had been &quot;little better than a building site in 1939&quot; and, when Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt inspected the line, the weak construction and inadequate weapons caused him to laugh. Despite France&#x27;s declaration of war against Germany in September 1939, there was no major combat involving the Siegfried Line at the start of the campaign in the West, except for a minor offensive by the French. Instead, both sides remained in a safe position behind their defences, during the so-called Phoney War.

The Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda drew foreign attention to the unfinished Westwall, in several instances showcasing incomplete or test positions to portray the project finished and ready for action. During the Battle of France, French forces made minor attacks against some parts of the line, but the majority was left untested in battle. When the campaign finished, transportable weapons and materials, such as metal doors, were removed from the Siegfried Line and used in other places such as the Atlantic Wall defences. The concrete sections were left in place in the countryside and soon became completely unfit for defense. The bunkers were used for storage instead.

=== Reactivation in 1944 ===
With the D-Day landings in Normandy on 6 June 1944, war in the West broke out once more. On 24 August 1944, Hitler gave a directive for renewed construction on the Siegfried Line. 20,000 forced labourers and members of the &quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot; (Reich Labour Service), most of whom were 14 to 16-year-old boys, attempted to re-equip the line for defensive purposes. Local people were also called in to carry out work, mostly building anti-tank ditches.

Even during construction, it was becoming clear that the bunkers could not withstand newly developed armour-piercing weapons. At the same time as the reactivation of the Siegfried Line, small concrete &quot;Tobruks&quot; were built along the borders of the occupied area. Those bunkers were mostly dugouts for single soldiers.

=== Clashes ===


In August 1944, the first clashes took place on the Siegfried Line. The section of the line where most fighting took place was the Hürtgenwald (Hürtgen Forest) area in the Eifel, south-east of Aachen. The Aachen Gap was the logical route into Germany&#x27;s Rhineland and its main industrial area, so it was where the Germans concentrated their defence.

The Americans committed an estimated 120,000 troops plus reinforcements to the Battle of Hürtgen Forest. The battle in the heavily forested area claimed the lives of 24,000 American soldiers, along with 9,000 so-called non-battle casualties — those evacuated because of fatigue, exposure, accidents and disease. The German death toll is not documented. After the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, the Battle of the Bulge began, a last-ditch attempt by the Germans to reverse the course of the war in the West. The offensive started in the area south of the Hürtgenwald, between Monschau and the Luxembourgish town of Echternach. German loss of life and material was severe and the effort failed. There were serious clashes along other parts of the Siegfried Line and defending soldiers in many bunkers refused to surrender, often fighting to the death. By early 1945, the last Siegfried Line bunkers had fallen at the Saar and Hunsrück.

The British 21st Army Group, which included US formations, also attacked the Siegfried Line. The resulting fighting brought total US losses to approximately 68,000. In addition, the First Army incurred over 50,000 non-battle casualties and the Ninth Army over 20,000. That brought the overall cost of the Siegfried Line Campaign, in US personnel, close to 140,000.

=== Postwar period ===


During the post-war period, many sections of the Siegfried Line were removed using explosives.

==== Preservation and destruction ====
In North Rhine Westphalia, about thirty bunkers still remain. Most of the rest were either destroyed with explosives or covered with earth. Tank traps still exist in many areas and, in the Eifel, they run over several kilometres. Zweibrücken Air Base was built on top of the Siegfried Line. When the base was still open, the remnants of several old bunkers could be seen in the tree line near the main gate. Another bunker was outside the base perimeter fence near the base hospital. Once the base was closed, workers, digging up the base&#x27;s fuel tanks, discovered lost bunkers buried below the tanks. 

Since 1997, with the motto &quot;The value of the unpleasant as a memorial&quot; (&quot;Der Denkmalswert des Unerfreulichen&quot;), an effort has been made to preserve the remains of the Siegfried Line as a historical monument. It was intended to stop reactionary fascist groups from using the Siegfried Line for propaganda purposes.

At the same time, state funding was still being provided to destroy the remains of the Siegfried Line. Consequently, emergency archaeological digs took place whenever any part of the line was to be removed, for example for road building. Archaeological activity was not able to stop the destruction of those sections, but furthered scientific knowledge and revealed details of the line&#x27;s construction.

==== Environmental conservation ====
Nature conservationists consider the remains of the Siegfried Line valuable as a chain of biotopes where, thanks to its size, rare animals and plants can take refuge and reproduce. That effect is magnified by the fact that the concrete ruins cannot be used for agricultural or forestry purposes.

== Westwall construction programmes ==

=== Border Watch ===
Small bunkers with thick walls were set up with three embrasures towards the front. Sleeping accommodations were hammocks. In exposed positions, similar small bunkers were erected with small round armoured &quot;lookout&quot; sections on the roofs. The programme was carried out by the Border Watch (&quot;Grenzwacht&quot;), a small military troop activated in the Rhineland immediately after the region was re-militarised by Germany from 1936 onwards, after having been de-militarised following the First World War.

=== Limes ===
The Limes programme began in 1938 following an order by Hitler to strengthen fortifications on the western German border. &quot;Limes&quot; refers to the former borders of the Roman Empire; the cover story for the programme was that it was an archaeological study.

Its Type 10 bunkers were more strongly constructed than the earlier border fortifications. These had thick ceilings and walls. A total of 3,471 were built along the entire length of the Siegfried Line. They featured a central room or shelter for 10–12 men with a stepped embrasure facing backwards and a combat section higher. This elevated section had embrasures at the front and sides for machine guns. More embrasures were provided for riflemen, and the entire structure was constructed so as to be safe against poison gas.

Heating was from a safety oven, the chimney of which was covered with a thick grating. Space was tight, with about per soldier, who was given a sleeping-place and a stool; the commanding officer had a chair. Surviving examples still retain signs warning &quot;Walls have ears&quot; and &quot;Lights out when embrasures are open!&quot;

=== Aachen-Saar ===
The Aachen-Saar programme bunkers were similar to those of the Limes programme: Type 107 double MG casemates with concrete walls up to thick. One difference was that there were no embrasures at the front, only at the sides of the bunkers. Embrasures were only built at the front in special cases and were then protected with heavy metal doors. This construction phase included the towns of Aachen and Saarbrücken, which were initially west of the Limes Programme defence line.

=== Western Air Defence Zone ===
The Western Air Defence Zone (&quot;Luftverteidigungszone West&quot; or &quot;LVZ West&quot;) continued parallel to the two other lines toward the east and consisted mainly of concrete &quot;flak&quot; foundations. Scattered MG 42 and MG 34 emplacements added additional defence against both air and land targets. Flak turrets were designed to force enemy planes to fly higher, thus decreasing the accuracy of their bombing. These towers were protected at close range by bunkers from the Limes and Aachen-Saar programmes.

=== Geldern Emplacement ===
The Geldern Emplacement lengthened the Siegfried Line northwards as far as Kleve on the Rhine and was built after the start of the Second World War. The Siegfried Line originally ended in the north near Brüggen in the Viersen district. The primary constructions were unarmed dugouts, but their extremely strong concrete design afforded excellent protection to the occupants. For camouflage they were often built near farms.

== Elements ==
Standard construction elements such as large Regelbau bunkers, smaller concrete &quot;pillboxes&quot;, and &quot;dragon&#x27;s teeth&quot; anti-tank obstacles were built as part of each construction phase, sometimes by the thousands. Frequently vertical steel rods would be interspersed between the teeth. This standardisation was the most effective use of scarce raw materials, transport and workers, but proved an ineffective tank barrier as US bulldozers simply pushed bridges of soil over these devices.

&quot;Dragon&#x27;s teeth&quot; tank traps were also known as &quot;Höcker&quot; in German (&#x27;humps&#x27; or &#x27;pimples&#x27; in English) because of their shape. These blocks of reinforced concrete stand in several rows on a single foundation. There are two typical sorts of barrier: Type 1938 with four rows of teeth getting higher toward the back, and Type 1939 with five rows of such teeth. Many other irregular lines of teeth were also built. Another design of tank obstacle, known as the Czech hedgehog, was made by welding together several bars of steel in such a way that any tank rolling over it would get stuck and possibly damaged. If the contour of the land allowed it, water-filled ditches were dug instead of tank traps. Examples of this kind of defence are those north of Aachen near Geilenkirchen.

== Working conditions ==
The early fortifications were mostly built by private firms, but the private sector was unable to provide the number of workers needed for the programmes that followed; this gap was filled by the Todt Organisation. With this organisation&#x27;s help, huge numbers of forced labourers – up to 500,000 at a time – worked on the Siegfried Line. Transport of materials and workers from all across Germany was managed by the &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot; railway company, which took advantage of the well-developed strategic railway lines built on Germany&#x27;s western border in World War I.

Working conditions were highly dangerous. For example, the most primitive means had to be used to handle and assemble extremely heavy armour plating, weighing up to .

Life on the building site and after work was monotonous, and many people gave up and left. Most workers received the West Wall Medal for their service.

== In propaganda ==
German propaganda, both at home and abroad, repeatedly portrayed the Westwall during its construction as an unbreachable bulwark. At the start of the war, the opposing troops remained behind their own defence lines.

As a morale booster for British troops marching off to France, the Siegfried Line was the subject of a popular song: &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Hang out the Washing on the Siegfried Line&quot;.
A French version by Ray Ventura (&quot;On ira pendre notre linge sur la ligne Siegfried&quot;) met a great success during the Phoney War (&quot;Drôle de guerre&quot;).

When asked about the Siegfried Line, General George S. Patton reportedly said &quot;Fixed fortifications are monuments to man&#x27;s stupidity.&quot;

<doc id="332719" wikidata="Q233843" url="?curid=332719" title="Elizabeth Montgomery">
<text>Elizabeth Victoria Montgomery (April 15, 1933 – May 18, 1995) was an American actress whose career spanned five decades in film, stage, and television. She portrayed the good witch Samantha Stephens on the popular television series &quot;Bewitched&quot;, which earned her five Primetime Emmy Award nominations and four Golden Globe Award nominations.

The daughter of actor, director and producer Robert Montgomery, she began her career in the 1950s with a role on her father&#x27;s television series &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, and she won a Theater World Award for her 1956 Broadway debut in the production &quot;Late Love&quot;. After &quot;Bewitched&quot; ended in 1972, Montgomery continued her career with roles in many television films, including &quot;A Case of Rape&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Legend of Lizzie Borden&quot; (1975), as Lizzie Borden. Both performances earned her additional Emmy Award nominations.

Throughout her career, Montgomery was involved in various forms of political activism and charitable work.

==Early life==
Montgomery was born on April 15, 1933, in Los Angeles, California, to Broadway actress Elizabeth Daniel Bryan Allen and film star Robert Montgomery. Montgomery&#x27;s mother was a native of Kentucky and her father was a native of New York. She had an elder sister, Martha Bryan Montgomery (named after her aunt Martha-Bryan Allen), who was born in 1931 and died in infancy, and a younger brother, Robert B. Montgomery Jr. Montgomery was of Irish and Scottish descent. Her great-grandfather, Archibald Montgomery, was born in County Antrim and emigrated to the United States from Belfast in 1847. Genealogical research which was conducted after her death revealed that she and Lizzie Borden, acquitted of the murder of her father and stepmother in 1893, were sixth cousins once removed; both of them were descended from 17th-century Massachusetts resident John Luther. Montgomery portrayed Borden in the television film &quot;The Legend of Lizzie Borden&quot; (1975), unaware that Borden was her distant cousin.

After attending the Westlake School for Girls in Holmby Hills, California, Montgomery graduated from the Spence School in New York City. She studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan for three years.

==Career==

===1951–1963: Early work===

Montgomery made her television debut in her father&#x27;s series &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; and on later occasions, she appeared as a member of his &quot;summer stock&quot; company of performers. In October 1953, Montgomery made her Broadway debut, starring in &quot;Late Love&quot;, for which she won a Theater World Award for her performance. She then made her film debut in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell&quot; (1955). Montgomery returned to Broadway in 1956, appearing in &quot;The Loud Red Patrick&quot;.

Montgomery&#x27;s early career consisted of starring roles and appearances in live television dramas and series, such as &quot;Studio One&quot;, &quot;Kraft Television Theater&quot;, &quot;Johnny Staccato&quot;, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Boris Karloff&#x27;s Thriller&quot;, and &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. Montgomery was nominated at the 13th Primetime Emmy Awards for her portrayal of southern nightclub performer Rusty Heller in a 1960 episode of &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, playing opposite David White, who later portrayed Larry Tate on &quot;Bewitched&quot;. She played the part of Rose Cornelius in the &quot;Rawhide&quot; episode &quot;Incident at El Crucero&quot; (1963).

Montgomery was featured in a role as a socialite who falls for a gangster (Henry Silva) in &quot;Johnny Cool&quot; (1963), directed by William Asher, and the film comedy &quot;Who&#x27;s Been Sleeping in My Bed?&quot; (also 1963), with Dean Martin and Carol Burnett, this time directed by Daniel Mann. After her appearance on &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, Alfred Hitchcock had her in mind to play the sister-in-law of Sean Connery, who sees herself as a rival to the troubled heroine in the film &quot;Marnie&quot; (1964), but Montgomery was unavailable.

===1964–1972: &quot;Bewitched&quot;===

In the ABC situation comedy &quot;Bewitched&quot;, Montgomery played the central role of lovable witch Samantha Stephens, with Dick York (and later with Dick Sargent) as her husband. Starting in the second season of the series, she also played the role of Samantha&#x27;s mischievous cousin, Serena, under the pseudonym Pandora Spocks (a pun on Pandora&#x27;s Box).

&quot;Bewitched&quot; became a ratings success (it was, at the time, the highest-rated series ever for the network). The series aired for eight seasons, from 1964 to 1972, and Montgomery received five Emmy and four Golden Globe nominations for her role on &quot;Bewitched&quot;. Despite low ratings late in the series run, it was renewed for a ninth season to run from fall of 1972. However, Montgomery&#x27;s marriage to &quot;Bewitched&quot; director William Asher was failing and the couple had separated by the end of the eighth season.

This situation caused severe friction in their professional relationship and it also ended any possibility of another season. As a consolation to ABC, Montgomery and Asher (under their company name Ashmont, which produced &quot;Bewitched&quot;) offered a half-hour sitcom, &quot;The Paul Lynde Show&quot;, to the network for the 1972–1973 season. Lynde&#x27;s series lasted only one year.

In a parody of her Samantha Stephens role, she made a cameo appearance as a witch at the end of the beach party film &quot;How to Stuff a Wild Bikini&quot; (1965). The film was directed by Asher, her husband at the time. That same year she also provided the voice of Samantha for an episode of the animated series &quot;The Flintstones&quot;.

===1973–1995: Later career===
Montgomery returned to Samantha-like twitching of her nose and on-screen magic in a series of Japanese television commercials (1980–1983) for &quot;Mother&quot; chocolate biscuits and cookies which were produced by the confectionery conglomerate Lotte Corp. These Japanese commercials provided a substantial salary for Montgomery while she remained out of sight of non-Japanese fans and the Hollywood industry.
In the United States, Montgomery spent much of her later career pursuing dramatic roles that took her as far away from the good-natured Samantha as possible. Among her later roles were performances that brought her Emmy Award nominations: a rape victim in &quot;A Case of Rape&quot; (1974), and the accused (but acquitted) murderer Lizzie Borden in William Bast&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Lizzie Borden&quot; (1975). After the actress died, Rhonda McClure, a genealogist, discovered that Montgomery and Borden were distant cousins.

Montgomery made many appearances on the game show &quot;Password&quot;. Allen Ludden, the show&#x27;s longtime host, called her the &quot;Queen of Password&quot;. Montgomery later played a pioneer woman facing hardship in 1820s Ohio in the miniseries &quot;The Awakening Land&quot; (1978), for which she earned her ninth Emmy nomination.

In &quot;A Killing Affair&quot; (1977), Montgomery played the role of a police detective who has an affair with her married partner, played by O. J. Simpson. In the television film &quot;Amos&quot; (1985), she played a rare villainous role, as a vicious nurse who abuses her wards in a home for senior citizens. The wards are played by Kirk Douglas and Dorothy McGuire, among others. In 1989, Montgomery returned to Broadway one last time in a production of &quot;Love Letters&quot;, opposite Robert Foxworth. She played one of her last roles in an episode of &quot;&quot; entitled &quot;Showdown&quot;, in which she played a barmaid; this was also her final work to be screened, since the episode aired posthumously. Her last television series was the highly rated Edna Buchanan detective series – the second and final film of the series received its first airing on May 9, 1995, only nine days before Montgomery died.

==Personal life==
In 1954, Montgomery married New York City socialite Frederick Gallatin Cammann; the couple divorced less than a year later. She was married to Academy Award winning actor Gig Young from 1956 to 1963 and then she was married to director-producer William Asher from 1963 until their divorce in 1973. They had three children: William, Robert and Rebecca. The latter two pregnancies were incorporated into &quot;Bewitched&quot; as Samantha&#x27;s pregnancies. During the eighth year of the show, Montgomery fell in love with director Richard Michaels. Their resulting affair led to the end of both of their marriages, as well as the end of the series. They moved in together when shooting ended in 1972; the relationship lasted two and a half years. On January 28, 1993, she married actor Robert Foxworth, after living with him for nearly twenty years. They remained married until her death in 1995.

According to author Herbie J Pilato, Montgomery had an affair with Alexander Godunov while she was living with Foxworth but was not yet married to him. Godunov was found dead on May 18, 1995, the day Montgomery died, but it is believed that he died several days before Montgomery.

Throughout the run of &quot;Bewitched&quot;, many references to Patterson, New York, were made on the series. The Putnam County town was the site of the Montgomery homestead, and it was also the place where she spent her childhood summers. In later years, her mother lived in the family farmhouse on Cushman Road.

===Political activism===
Montgomery was personally devoted to liberal political causes, and in accordance with her political views, she lent her name, along with a large amount of her time, her money, and her energy to a wide variety of charitable and political causes. She was a champion of animal rights, women&#x27;s rights, HIV/AIDS activism, and gay rights. She was also an ardent critic of the Vietnam War, she supported Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1968, and in later years, she was an active advocate for AIDS research and outreach to the disabled community. In 1988, Montgomery and her partner Robert Foxworth supported Jesse Jackson&#x27;s 1988 presidential campaign. Professionally, she lent her voice as the narrator of two political documentaries which were critical of U.S. foreign policy, &quot;Cover Up: Behind the Iran Contra Affair&quot; (1988) and its Academy Award-winning sequel &quot;The Panama Deception&quot; (1992). In June 1992, Montgomery and Dick Sargent, her former &quot;Bewitched&quot; co-star as well as her good friend, were grand marshals at the Los Angeles Gay Pride Parade.

===Charitable work===
During the last year of her life, Montgomery volunteered at the Los Angeles Unit of Learning Ally, a nonprofit organization which records educational audio books for disabled people. In 1994, Montgomery produced several radio and television public-service announcements for Learning Ally&#x27;s Los Angeles unit. The following January, Montgomery recorded the 1952 edition of &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot; by A. A. Milne. 

On June 3, 1995, sixteen days after her death, Learning Ally&#x27;s Los Angeles unit dedicated its 1995 Record-A-Thon to Montgomery. Twenty-one other celebrities lent their talents to a recorded version of &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot;, which was dedicated to her memory.

==Illness and death==
Montgomery suffered from colon cancer. She ignored the influenza-like symptoms during the filming of &quot;Deadline for Murder: From the Files of Edna Buchanan&quot;, which she finished filming in late March 1995. Due to the late diagnosis, the cancer metastasized from her colon to her liver.

With no hope of recovery and unwilling to die in a hospital, Montgomery chose to return to her Beverly Hills home that she shared with Foxworth. She died on the morning of May 18, 1995, at the age of 62, surrounded by Foxworth and her three children from her previous marriage to William Asher. Her body was cremated.

On June 18, 1995, one month after her death, a memorial service was held at the Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills. Herbie Hancock played music, Amanda McBroom sang, and Dominick Dunne spoke about the early years of their friendship when both of them lived in New York City, while Foxworth read many of the sympathy cards sent by fans. Other speakers included her daughter, her brother, her stepson, and her nurse.

Montgomery had kept her parents&#x27; home in Patterson, Putnam County, New York. Roughly three years after her death, the estate was sold and became a part of Wonder Lake State Park.

==Legacy==

*On April 19, 1998, Montgomery&#x27;s family held an auction and a sale of her clothing to benefit the AIDS Healthcare Foundation of Los Angeles. Erin Murphy, who played Tabitha on the &quot;Bewitched&quot; television series, modeled the clothing that was auctioned.
*In June 2005, a bronze statue of Montgomery as Samantha Stephens was erected in Salem, Massachusetts.
*A star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was presented in honor of Montgomery&#x27;s work on television on January 4, 2008. The location of the star is 6533 Hollywood Blvd.

<text>Mohammad Qasim Fahim (, popularly known as &quot;Marshal Fahim&quot;; – 9 March 2014) was an Afghan military commander and politician who served as Vice President of Afghanistan from June 2002 until December 2004 and from November 2009 until his death. He was considered a powerful and influential figure during the Karzai Administration.

Affiliated with Ahmad Shah Massoud&#x27;s Jamiat Islami (Shura-e Nazar) party, Fahim captured the Afghan capital Kabul in the fall of 2001 from the Taliban government as a military commander of the Northern Alliance. Between December 2001 and December 2004, he served as Defense Minister under the Afghan Transitional Administration. In 2004, President Hamid Karzai provided Fahim the honorary title Marshal and a year later, he became member of the House of Elders. He later became a recipient of the Ahmad Shah Baba Medal. Fahim died due to natural causes in 2014; the president declared three days of national mourning in honor of him.

== Early years ==
Fahim was born in Omarz, a small village in the Panjshir Province of Afghanistan and is of Tajik ethnicity. He was the son of Qala Dar from the Panjshir Valley. He is reported to have finished his studies in Islamic Sharia law at an Arabic institute in Kabul in 1977. Most reports show that he had been fighting the Communist rulers since the late 70s. A TOLOnews video chronicling his life reports that Fahim joined the Muslim Youth Movement of Afghanistan while he was still in college.
He fled Afghanistan after the Communist coup of 1978, he became a refugee in Peshawar. He returned to Panjshir and began to work under Commander Ahmad Shah Masood.

==Careers==
When the Soviet-backed Afghan government collapsed in 1992, Fahim became a key member in the new government. He was appointed head of the Afghan intellgicence service KHAD, under interim president Sibghatullah Mojaddedi. He continued to serve as the country&#x27;s head of intelligence under president Burhanuddin Rabbani.

In 1996, Fahim personally offered to evacuate former President Mohammad Najibullah, then in custody in Kabul, from the advancing Taliban forces, but Najibullah refused to be evacuated and was captured and executed by a Taliban mob. Fahim continued to serve as head of the Intelligence and Minister of National Security of the internationally recognised United Islamic Front Government, even when it was ousted and the Taliban took the power over most provinces of Afghanistan in the second half of the 1990s. During this time of Taliban rule in Afghanistan Fahim was active as military commander for the United Islamic Front in the north of Afghanistan, especially in Panjshir and Mazar-i-Sharif.

===As Defense Minister===
On 9 September 2001, Ahmad Shah Massoud, Afghanistan&#x27;s most important resistance leader and Defense Minister of the ousted but international recognized government, was assassinated by al-Qaeda operatives posing as journalists. Two days later, Fahim was confirmed as the new defence minister of the United Islamic Front (Northern Alliance), succeeding Massoud. Fahim was a close ally and protégé of Massoud.

In the wake of building pressure of the US against the Taliban regime after September 11, 2001, as general commander of the mujahideen resistance forces, Fahim became America&#x27;s main proxy in the fight against the Taliban. He was anxious to start a military offensive and even pledged to launch an attack against the Taliban, without waiting for US military action, saying: &quot;Today we have a chance to defeat the Taliban and the terrorists, and we will use it whatever the cost.&quot; On 7 October, the day the US started bombing Taliban targets, he proclaimed an offensive on the northern and western fronts.

On October, 20, a US team of Green Berets landed in Afghanistan and teamed up with Fahim. On 30 October, Fahim met with American General Tommy Franks where they discussed the idea to launch the first major strike of the war against Mazar-e-Sharif, a city that Fahim a month earlier named as the first city that he would conquer.

Mazar-e Sharif was captured by opposition forces on 9 and 10 November and only a few days later, the Taliban evacuated Kabul. US President George W. Bush had requested that opposition forces would not enter the city before a new, broad-based, multi-ethnic government was formed. But Fahim went into the city with a group of specially trained security personnel, although he made sure to leave the main body of his troops outside the city.

At the end of November, forces loyal to Fahim captured the city of Kunduz. That brought Fahim in charge of two of the five biggest cities, since other main cities were captured by militias of Gul Agha Sherzai and Hamid Karzai (Kandahar), Ismail Khan (Herat) en Abdul Rashid Dostum (Mazar-e-Sharif).

In the first days after the fall of Kabul, a supreme military council, headed by Fahim, was set up to administer the captured parts of the country. The military council gave itself a three-month mandate in which they proclaimed not to hand over the power to United Islamic Front president Burhanuddin Rabbani.

===Formation of an interim government in Bonn===

During these three months, the international community sponsored a conference on Afghanistan in Bonn to decide about the future leadership of the country. With crucial US military help, the opposition forces had captured virtually all of Afghanistan from the Taliban in the beginning of December 2001, and in Bonn the formation of an interim administration was discussed.

As the US started bombing Afghanistan in the fall of 2001, it became clear that the United Islamic Front of Fahim would play an important role in the transition government that would emerge after the Taliban was ousted. However, since Fahim lacked Massoud&#x27;s magnetism, his role as opposition leader was generally seen as temporary. When in the first weeks of US bombardments Fahim&#x27;s forces did not make any large breakthroughs, it was speculated that he was struggling with his role and he appeared wooden and awkward in front of his troops. But although Fahim was described as colorless, it was clear that as the leader of the main military forces that were fighting the Taliban, Fahim had to play a central role in any possible government that would succeed the Taliban.

In the talks in Bonn Fahim took a leading role, together with two other young and moderate Tajik leaders from the United Islamic Front (UIF), Yunus Qanuni and dr. Abdullah. After the death of Massoud, this trio had de facto been leading the United Islamic Front. Fahim was reportedly advocating a broad-based government headed by someone outside the leadership of the United Islamic Front. According to sources Fahim lobbied for Hamid Karzai as the next Afghan president instead for his formal leader Rabbani.

The Bonn conference bypassed President Rabbani and appointed Hamid Karzai as Interim President. Qanuni, Abdullah and Fahim all got crucial posts in the new government. Initially there was some fear that the trivium of former Massoud-aides could overshadow Karzai, but at the same time, they were praised for giving away the chairmanship while they controlled Afghanistan militarily.

As commander of Afghans largest military force, Fahim was appointed Defence minister of Afghanistan. At the same time, he was one of the five vice-chairs of the Interim Administration. Together with Abdullah and Qanuni, one of the most dominant figures in the interim administration.

===Vice-Chairman of the Interim Administration===
In the interim administration, Karzai much needed the support of Fahim. Karzai was the official chairman of the executive committee of the government, but as commander of the most effective military force commanding the capital, Fahim had the real power.

Since Fahim was afraid a large international peace keeping force would take away his power base, he argued for a limited number of foreign troops in Afghanistan. Karzai, however, was less afraid of international involvement, and might even fear a Tajik hegemony of Afghanistan without them.

After the inauguration ceremony on 22 December 2001, where Fahim was installed as minister of Defence and vice-chair of the interim government, he requested that international forces leave the capital. He &quot;would no longer accept foreign troops in Afghanistan operating without a UN mandate,&quot; Fahim said. Later he demanded that 100 British servicemen who just had entered the country leave Bagram Air Base. &quot;The British forces perhaps have an agreement with the UN but not with us,&quot; said Fahim. He also stated that a UN force should not exceed 1,000 men and should play a very limited role in Afghan politics and that his own forces could eradicate sources of instability. His own Northern Alliance forces should police Kabul, said Fahim, because he said that his troops in Kabul were security troops, not military.

Fahim discussed the deployment of foreign troops with US Generals and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld who demanded the presence of a large international force. Fahim was in charge of the meetings with the British General John McColl to establish the exact task, length of stay and size of international forces. Reportedly, Fahim refused to meet McColl until Rumsfeld pressured him and told him to meet the British general.

In the end, it was decided that an international security force of a few thousand troops would be deployed, but that they would agree to Fahim&#x27;s demands to not take control of Kabul and not start immediately disarming Afghan militias. Of the approximately 3,000 men that would be deployed, 2,000–3,000 men would be deployed in a garrison in the center of Kabul. Of the 30,000 men, only a third would be deployed for security reasons, the others would receive logistical and humanitarian tasks. Another important task for the British and Americans would be the training of the Afghan troops. Fahim expressed the wish to build an Afghan army of around 250,000 men. After the negotiations, The Telegraph described Fahim as someone who is popularly known as &quot;the village and Pansher valley idiot,&quot; but who actually very shrewd.

When the first foreign troops of the peacekeeping mission arrived on 20 December 2001, Fahim said &quot;They won&#x27;t be needed for security.&quot; &quot;They are here because they want to be,&quot; and because the United Nations Security Council sent them to Afghanistan to prevent another civil war, Fahim said, but insisted that their presence was merely symbolic and that the foreign troops were not supposed to use force. &quot;Some ministers in the new government who have always lived outside the country are worried about security and they feel they need the peacekeepers for protection, but when they arrive here they will see that the situation is OK and that it is not necessary&quot; Fahim added, possibly hinting at Chairman Karzai who lived for years in Pakistan. The heavily armed units of northern alliance soldiers who swept into Kabul will be withdrawn from the streets, Fahim added, but they will not leave the capital.

There was not only a disagreement between Fahim and Karzai about the size of the peacekeeping force, but also about the duration they were supposed to stay in Afghanistan. Fahim indicated that the international forces should leave after six years, but Karzai said that they would stay &quot;as long as we need them, six years as a minimum&quot;.

As Defense Minister, Fahim had the task to unite the country&#x27;s disparate armed groups. A daunting task, since Fahim&#x27;s own troops had so far shied away from vast stretches of southern and eastern lawless lands under the sway of armed former Taliban warriors, most of them members of the dominant Pashtun ethnic group. Still, although a sometimes bumbling and awkward figure in public, and especially unpopular with the Uzbek minority, Fahim quietly had gained control of the Northern Alliance&#x27;s fractious military commanders. He continued to hold this control, even when Abdul Rashid Dostum, the most powerful Uzbek warlord who had taken control of the city of Mazar-e-Sharif and who was very critical of the Bonn Agreement, was appointed his deputy. But the cooperation between the two strongmen didn&#x27;t start easy, already after a month forces of Dostum were clashing with forces of Fahim over control of a district in Kunduz Province. The dispute erupted after his forces tried to disarm soldiers from a rival military unit. When those troops resisted, a firefight broke out, killing three soldiers.

On 29 December, Fahim urged the Americans to stop their bombing campaign on Afghanistan, because bin Laden had probably fled Afghanistan and moved to Peshawar in Pakistan. &quot;Osama is out of our control,&quot; Fahim said. A day later, however, foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah stated that they did not know where bin Laden was and that air raids will continue &quot;for as long as it takes to finish off the terrorists.&quot;

===Relations with other states===
As Minister of Defence in his first months, Fahim traveled extensively to neighbouring countries to build relations between the new government and Afghanistan&#x27;s most influential neighbours. When US-envoy to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad said in January 2002 that Iran might be backing Afghan fighters in an attempt to unsettle the Karzai-government, Fahim, who visited the Iranian minister of Defense half January, stated that there was no sign of Iran &quot;creating insecurity&quot;. At the end of January 2002, Fahim set in on a meeting of Karzai met with United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and spoke with the two of them about security issues.

===First term as Vice President===

During the 2002 loya jirga, where a new transitional government was formed, Fahim supported the candidacy for president of Karzai. In turn he retained as vice-president and defense minister.

In the summer of 2002, American officials are said to have picked up intelligence that Fahim was considering an attempt to assassinate Karzai, as a result of which, in July 2002, US Special Forces wrested presidential bodyguard duties away from soldiers loyal to Fahim. The move followed the assassination earlier in the month of one of Karzai&#x27;s vice presidents, Abdul Qadir, a powerful Pashtun warlord and Karzai ally.

As Defense Minister, he toured army bases in the United Kingdom, negotiated security issues with US General Tommy Franks and Canadian Defense Minister John McCallum, NATO Secretary General George Robertson, visited Moscow and Washington, DC. He also replaced 15 ethnic Tajik generals with officers from the Pashtun, Uzbek and Hazara ethnic groups, although he was accused of delaying reforms that would have required him to replace his Tajik generals with a more ethnically balanced officer corps. The reform was a precondition for carrying out a $200 million UN-sponsored plan to pay off and disarm 100,000 militiamen loyal to the warlords.

While holding the position, he continued to command his own militia which he inherited from the United Front or more commonly known as the Northern Alliance. However, on 10 December 2003, he ordered part of his militia to transport their weapons to an Afghan National Army installation near Kabul.

On 12 September 2003, Miloon Kothari, appointed by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to investigate housing rights in Afghanistan, announced that many of the government ministers including Fahim and Education Minister Yunus Qanuni were illegally occupying land and should be removed from their posts. However, three days later, Kothari sent a letter to Lakhdar Brahimi, the head of the UN in Afghanistan, saying he had gone too far in naming the ministers.
In 2004, many expected Karzai to name Fahim or Qanuni as candidate for vice-president in the upcoming presidential election, but he named Ahmad Zia Massoud instead. Subsequently, Fahim backed the candidacy of his fellow Tajik, Yunus Qanuni for president.

After Karzai&#x27;s victory, Fahim was not reappointed Defense Minister and was succeeded by his deputy Abdul Rahim Wardak. Karzai dropped Fahim from his cabinet to rebalance the Ministry of Defence, and as a result of intense pressure from various foreign organizations who viewed Fahim as a major bottleneck in the disarmament process. He was dismissed in August 2004. Fahim also had no higher education, and article 72 of Afghanistan&#x27;s constitution states that an appointed Minister to the President&#x27;s cabinet should have a higher education. In a decree made in December 2004, Karzai, who called Fahim his &quot;close friend and confidant&quot; confirmed that Fahim would hold the rank of Marshal, Afghanistan&#x27;s highest, for life. Years after his death, at a gathering of Fahim&#x27;s supporters and Afghan politicians, Marking the 5th anniversary of his death, Hazara leader Muhammad Mohaqiq, defending Fahim&#x27;s military title arguing &quot;When he was given the title of Afghanistan&#x27;s Marshal by the former president, he deserved it. Because the Mujahideen had won the war against the occupier forces.&quot;

Although Fahim lost his formal role in the government, he remained a powerful and influential figure in Afghanistan. In 2006, Karzai, faced with a resurgent Taliban, returned Marshal Fahim to Government as an advisor.

Some Afghan analysts attest that, despite losing his military position, Fahim remained a very powerful figure in the country. &quot;[He] is particularly popular among people in the north, because he had fought Soviet Russia, and later the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. He spent many years fighting aggressors.&quot; (Erada, 2005)

Later in the year 2006, Karzai said, &quot;Marshal Fahim is one of the sons of our [mujahedin], a patriot and [a man who loves] his country. I have a great deal of respect for Marshal Fahim. He has been my close friend and confidant. He has his own unique place in Afghanistan. He has been a respectable military man. He is a five-star general. And he is a senator.&quot; Regarding his decision in appointing Marshal Fahim as one of his advisors, Karzai added that &quot;I hope that officially as my adviser, he will continue to cooperate with me. He comes to all of the National Security Council meetings. He is my dear brother. No one can ever reduce the respect that Marshal Fahim has earned for himself.&quot; (Azadi Radio, 5 April 2006) Throughout his time as a public figure, he has had persistent accusations of corruption and human rights abuses. When he died, the American-led coalition simply expressed condolences to Fahim&#x27;s family.

Fahim was a member of the (now defunct) political party United National Front, a broad coalition of former and current strongmen, mainly with a basis in the United Islamic Front.

===Second term as Vice President===
In 2009, Fahim was chosen by incumbent President Karzai as candidate for first Vice President in the 2009 presidential election. Fahim by then had a reputation as one of Afghanistan&#x27;s most powerful, brutal and corrupt warlords. Karzai&#x27;s decision to include him on his ticket therefore dismayed international observers. Many in Kabul alleged Marshal Fahim was at the time involved in criminal activities, including kidnapping for ransom. By choosing Fahim as his vice-president, Karzai was said to have stained his own credibility even further.

But for Karzai such considerations were trumped by Fahim&#x27;s status as a leading member of Afghanistan&#x27;s Tajik minority (the second largest ethnic grouping after Karzai&#x27;s Pashtun community), which helped to split the Tajik vote which might otherwise have gone to Karzai&#x27;s Tajik rival, Abdullah Abdullah.

The election was won by Karzai and from 19 November on, Fahim again served as vice president.

==Assassination attempts==

Fahim survived several assassination attempts. His convoy was targeted when a mine exploded underneath the central car in Fahim&#x27;s convoy. He had been on an official visit to the eastern city of Jalalabad &quot;to discuss a new government campaign to stop farmers growing poppies for the opium trade and other issues with local commanders and tribal leaders.&quot; (BBC, 8 April 2002)

Fahim survived another attack later in 2002. This time, the man behind the attack was arrested by the intelligence agency. The alleged person carried with him &quot;22 pounds of explosives in the pockets of his jacket, attached to wires and apparently ready to explode.&quot; (The New York Times, 24 November 2002)

In June 2003, a bomb was found in front of his home. Later in the year, the head of his personal security died at the hands of a suicide bomber.

Fahim survived another assassination attempt in the northern Kunduz province. Only 26 July 2009, as the running mate of President Karzai for the 2009 elections, his convoy was attacked in an ambush staged by the Taliban. The Taliban attacked Fahim&#x27;s convoy using automatic rifles and rocket propelled grenades.

==Peace negotiations of 2010==
On the celebrations of &quot;Nowruz&quot;, New Year&#x27;s Day, of 1389 (21 March 2010) in Mazar-i-Sharif in Northern Afghanistan, Fahim reached out to militants. He declared that, with their input, a coming national conference would lay the foundations for a peace that would end the Taliban insurgency. He called on resistance forces to participate in a jirga, or assembly, planned for late April or early May. He pledged that the Afghan government &quot;will try to find a peaceful life for those Afghans who are unhappy,&quot; a euphemism for militants, though he didn&#x27;t mention the Taliban by name. Afghans had travelled from across the country to Mazar-i-Sharif united behind the wish that the advent of a new year would bring them peace. According to the police, up to half a million people are in the city to mark the spring equinox and the first day of the traditional Afghan new year and celebrated across Central Asia and Iran. Mazar is at the heart of one of the most peaceful regions of the country. City police chief Abdul Rauf Taj said that 4,000 security personnel had been deployed against insurgent attacks and that all visitors were being screened at seven check points around the city perimeter.

The Peace Jirga took place in Kabul on 2–4 June 2010.

==Other activities==
He was a member of the leadership council of the United Islamic Front, a coalition of top national and regional leaders. Other members included former President Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani, House Speaker Yunus Qanuni, Vice-president Ahmad Zia Massoud.

In June 2007, Fahim stated that his advisory role was merely symbolic and that he never had the chance to advise the President. He further said that after the 2004 elections President Karzai formed a &quot;one-sided&quot; cabinet and began to employ unilateralism as his main policy driver. Fahim argued that without the backing of foreign forces, President Karzai&#x27;s regime would not last longer than a week.

In 2009, he was one of Karzai&#x27;s running mates in the presidential election, bringing a lot of Tajik votes to the ticket. The selection was condemned by Human Rights Watch.

In September 2010, an Afghan news agency reported that Fahim had died of cancer in Paris, France. An official statement was later released by Fahim, who said: &quot;I am completely healthy. I request the Afghan people not to trust news published by irresponsible websites&quot;.

==Death==
Fahim&#x27;s last years were beset by health problems which required hospital treatment in Germany. He died of a heart attack on 9 March 2014.

Karzai called Fahim&#x27;s death &quot;a huge loss for Afghanistan&quot; and the government of Afghanistan called for a three-day national mourning period. The UN called him in a statement &quot;a good and trusted partner of the UN.&quot;

The Prime Minister of India, while emphasizing his role in fostering India-Afghanistan relations, called him &quot;a brave and fearless military commander, whose contribution to Afghanistan&#x27;s stabilisation and reconstruction after over three decades of war and conflict will always be remembered. Marshal Fahim was also a close friend of India. We shall never forget his personal contribution to nurturing and strengthening the India Afghanistan strategic partnership.&quot; Ambassador James Cunningham of the United States called him &quot;a leader during the Jihad, and that he played a major role in moving Afghanistan toward moderation.&quot;

After his death, the Afghan National Defense University was renamed Marshal Fahim National Defense University (MFNDU).

His death came only a few weeks before Karzai was due to step down from the presidency, and as NATO forces pull out of Afghanistan, added to the prevailing atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.

His life and legacy were commemorated annually on the 9th of March in Kabul and other provinces during the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.

<text>MEGA Channel, also known as MEGA TV or just MEGA, is a television network in Greece, that broadcasts a mix of foreign and Greek programming. It is the first and the oldest private television network in Greece.

==History==
===Mega Channel (1989–2018)===
Mega is the first private television station to launch in Greece on 20 November 1989 and was the trade name of Teletypos S.A. (Τηλέτυπος A.E.)

The channel regularly achieved the top ratings spot in Greece through its varied programming including comedies, dramas, news, current affairs and entertainment shows. Examples include the popular Greek comedies &quot;Sto Para Pente&quot;, &quot;Savatogenimmenes&quot; and &quot;Maria, i Aschimi&quot;.

The channel was also granted the rights to Victoria Hislop&#x27;s novel The Island. This became a 26 episode drama series called To Nisi. The show was the most expensive show in Greek television history with a budget of €4 million.

===Financial problems and subsequent closure===
Since 2012, the parent company had been experiencing financial issues due to poor borrowing practises. In 2016, the channels debts were reported to be approximately €116 million. At the same time, reports of staff being unpaid began to emerge.

In 2016, it was reported that the company was restructuring loans in order to continue operations. This was despite the fact the company didn&#x27;t proceed with a share capital increase of 15 million euros that was agreed in exchange for the banks agreeing to extend their return to 2021.

The staff of Mega Channel continued to keep the channel on air despite not being paid and being ignored by the parent company. The decision was taken to cease all news and live programming and instead focus on rebroadcasting content from their extensive program library without commercial breaks.

Mega continued broadcasting until it was removed from the platforms. The channel was removed by Digea (the company responsible for digital over-the-air broadcasting in Greece) at 02:08:36 on the morning of 28 October 2018. The channel was then also removed from pay-TV platforms on 20 November 2018. The channel did continue to broadcast via online streaming from its webpage.

===Sale of assets===
On 1 November 2019, the Mega Channel branding, logo and vast program library were put up for auction.

The winning bid of €33,999,999 belonged to Alter Ego Mass Media Co. S.A.

===Mega Channel (2019–present)===
Following the auction, plans were put in place to re-launch Mega.

On 20 November 2019, the channel relaunched with a variety of live programming, news, movies and selected programs from its program library.

The channel was using the familiar &#x27;Mega Mou&#x27; (My Mega) on-screen branding that was originally used between 2010 and 2014 as well as the new tag line of Mega όπως πάντα! (Mega as always!).
However, on June 27, 2021, the channel retired the &#x27;Mega Mou&#x27; branding and began to use a new ident package in which objects form the logo.

Under the ownership of Alter Ego, the channel is now located at 340 Syngrou Avenue, Kallithea, Athens, Greece.

<doc id="332727" wikidata="Q1361707" url="?curid=332727" title="History of gardening">
<text>The early history of gardening is largely entangled with the history of agriculture, with gardens that were mainly ornamental generally the preserve of the elite until quite recent times. Smaller gardens generally had being a kitchen garden as their first priority, as is still often the case.
The broad traditions that have dominated gardening since ancient times include those of the Ancient Near East, which became the Islamic garden, the Mediterranean, which produced the Roman garden, hugely influencing later European gardening, and the Chinese garden and its development on the Japanese garden. While the basic gardening techniques were fairly well understood by trial and error from early on, the plants available in a particular location have changed enormously, especially in recent centuries. Many new groups of plants have been introduced from other parts of the world, and the ornamental plants now used are mostly cultivars bred to improve qualities such as colour, length of flowering, size and hardiness.
In Europe during the Renaissance, garden design was dominated by the Italian garden, which developed into the French formal garden, dominating the Baroque period. Both were formal styles, attempting to impose architectural principles on the garden. In the 18th century, the English landscape garden developed, apparently informal and natural, but requiring very large spaces, and by the end of the century dominated all Europe in the largest new gardens.

Gardening may be considered as aesthetic expressions of beauty through art and nature, a display of taste or style in civilized life, an expression of an individual&#x27;s or culture&#x27;s philosophy, and sometimes as a display of private status or national pride—in private and public landscapes.

==Introduction==
The enclosure of outdoor space probably began around 10,000 BC. Historians imagine the first enclosure was a type of barrier used for excluding animals and marauders, perhaps beginning in West Asia, thereafter spreading to South and East Asia, and westward into Greece, and Europe. The modern words &quot;garden&quot; and &quot;yard&quot; are descendants of the Old English &quot;geard&quot;, which denotes a fence or enclosure.

After the emergence of the first civilizations, wealthy citizens began creating gardens for purely aesthetic purposes. Egyptian tomb paintings of the 16th century BC are some of the earliest physical evidence of ornamental horticulture and landscape design depicting lotus ponds surrounded by symmetrical rows of acacias and palms. Another ancient tradition is of Persia: Darius the Great was said to have had a &quot;paradise garden&quot; and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were renowned as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Persian gardens were designed along a central axis of symmetry.

Persian influences extended to Hellenistic Greece after Alexander the Great. C. 350 BC there were gardens at the Academy of Athens, and Theophrastus, who wrote on botany, supposedly inherited a garden from Aristotle. Epicurus had a garden where he walked and taught, and he bequeathed it to Hermarchus of Mytilene. Alciphron also referenced private gardens in his writing.

The most influential ancient gardens in the western world were those of Ptolemy in Alexandria, Egypt and the horticultural tradition that Lucullus brought to Rome. Wall paintings in Pompeii, Italy attest to later elaborate development. The wealthiest Romans built extensive villa gardens with water features, including fountains and rivulets, topiary, roses, and shaded arcades. Archeological evidence survives at sites such as Hadrian&#x27;s Villa.

Vitruvius, a Roman author and engineer, wrote the oldest extant design manual in 27 BC. &quot;De architectura libri decem&quot; (&quot;Ten Books on Architecture&quot;) addressed design theory, landscape architecture, engineering, water supply, and public projects, such as parks and squares. Vitruvius asserted that &quot;firmitas&quot; (firmness, durability, strength), &quot;utilitas&quot; (commodity, convenience, utility) and &quot;venustas&quot; (delight, loveliness, beauty) were the primary objectives of design. Some still consider these elements essential to quality design of landscape.

Byzantium and Moorish Spain continued horticultural traditions after the 4th century AD and the decline of Rome. By this time, a separate horticultural tradition formed in China, which was transmitted to Japan, where it developed into aristocratic gardens featuring miniaturized and simulated natural landscapes centered on ponds, and the severe Zen garden form featured at temples.

In Europe, the medieval garden developed slowly, perhaps with a particular revival in Languedoc and the Île-de-France in the 13th century. By the end of the period, an interest in ornamental gardens was well developed. The rediscovery of descriptions of antique Roman villas and gardens led to the creation of a new form of garden, the Italian Renaissance garden, in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The Spanish Crown built the first public parks of this era in the 16th century, both in Europe and the Americas. The formal garden à la française, exemplified by the Gardens of Versailles, became the dominant horticultural style in Europe until the middle of the 18th century, when the English landscape garden and the French landscape garden acceded to dominance. In the 19th century, a welter of historical revivals and Romantic cottage-inspired gardening emerged. In England, William Robinson and Gertrude Jekyll were influential proponents of the wild garden and the perennial garden, respectively. Andrew Jackson Downing and Frederick Law Olmsted adapted European forms for North America, especially influencing the design of public parks, campuses and suburban landscapes. Olmsted&#x27;s influence extended well into the 20th century.
The 20th century saw the influence of modernism in the garden: from the articulate clarity of Thomas Church to the bold colors and forms of the Brazilian Roberto Burle Marx.

Environmental consciousness and sustainable design practices, such as green roofs and rainwater harvesting, are becoming widely practiced as innovations in these fields continue to develop.
==The historical development of garden styles==
===Mesopotamian gardens===

Mesopotamia, the &quot;land between the Rivers&quot; Tigris and Euphrates, comprises a hilly and mountainous northern area and a flat, alluvial south. Its peoples (Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians) were urban and literate from about 3,000 BC. Evidence for their gardens comes from written texts, pictorial sculpture, and archaeology. In Western tradition, Mesopotamia was the location of the Garden of Eden and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Temple gardens developed from the representation of a sacred grove; several distinct styles of royal garden are also known.

The courtyard garden was enclosed by the walls of a palace, or on a larger scale was a cultivated place inside the city walls. At Mari on the Middle Euphrates (c. 1,800 BC), one of the huge palace courtyards was called the Court of the Palms in contemporary written records. It is crossed by raised walkways of baked brick; the king and his entourage would dine there. At Ugarit (c. 1,400 BC), there was a stone water basin, not located centrally as in later Persian gardens, for the central feature was probably a tree (date, palm, or tamarisk). The 7th century BC, Assyrian king Assurbanipal is shown on a sculpture feasting with his queen, reclining on a couch beneath an arbour of vines, attended by musicians. Trophies of conquest are on display, including the dismembered head of the king of Elam hanging from a fragrant pine branch. A Babylonian text from the same period is divided into sections, as if showing beds of soil with the names of medicinal, vegetable, and herbal plants written into each square, perhaps representing a &quot;parterre&quot; design.

On a larger scale, royal hunting parks were established to hold the exotic animals and plants which the king had acquired on his foreign campaigns. King Tiglath-Pileser I (c. 1,000 BC) lists horses, oxen, asses, deer of two types, gazelle and ibex, boasting &quot;I numbered them like flocks of sheep.&quot;

From around 1,000 BC, the Assyrian kings developed a style of city garden incorporating a naturalistic layout, running water supplied from river headwaters, and exotic plants from their foreign campaigns. Assurnasirpal II (883–859 BC) lists pines of different kinds, cypresses and junipers of different kinds, almonds, dates, ebony, rosewood, olive, oak, tamarisk, walnut, terebinth and ash, fir pomegranate, pear, quince, fig and grapevines: &quot;The canal water gushes from above into the gardens; fragrance pervades the walkways; streams of water as numerous as the stars of heaven flow in the pleasure garden... Like a squirrel, I pick fruit in the garden of delights.&quot; The city garden reached its zenith with the palace design of Sennacherib (704–681 BC), whose water system stretched for 50 km into the hills, whose garden was higher and more ornate than any others, and who boasted of the complex technologies he deployed, calling his palace and garden &quot;a wonder for all peoples&quot;.

The biblical Book of Genesis mentions the Tigris and Euphrates as two of the four rivers bounding the Garden of Eden. No specific place has been identified, although there are many theories.

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are listed by classical Greek writers as one of the Seven Wonders of the World – places to see before you die. The excavated ruins of Babylon do not reveal any suitable evidence, which has led some scholars to suggest that they may have been purely legendary. Alternatively, the story may have originated from Sennacherib&#x27;s garden in Nineveh.

=== Indian subcontinental gardens ===
Gardens in Indian subcontinent finds mentions in early literature, which mentions different types of gardens and method to build them. Archeologically, the gardens at Sigiriya in Sri Lanka is the best-preserved water gardens in South Asia and is also one of the oldest landscaped gardens in the world.

==== Indian gardens ====

Ancient Indian gardens are mentioned in several ancient Hindu texts including Rigveda, &quot;Ramayana&quot;, and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Buddhist accounts mention bamboo grove which was gifted by King Bimbisara to Buddha. Digha Nikaya, a Buddhist text, also mentions Buddha staying in the mango orchard of the Jivaka monastery, gifted by the physician Jivaka. Arama in Sanskrit means garden, and sangharama is a place where buddhist monk community lived in a garden like place. In Buddha&#x27;s time, Vaishali was a prosperous and populous town full of parks and gardens and according to Lalit Vistara, it resembled a city of God. Emperor Ashoka&#x27;s inscriptions mention the establishment of botanical gardens for planting medicinal herbs, plants, and trees. They contained pools of water, were laid in grid patterns, and normally had chattri pavilions with them. The Kama Sutra mentions details on house gardens and that a good wife should plant vegetables, bunches of sugarcane, clumps of the fig trees, mustard, parsley and fennel, various flowers like jasmine, rose and others likewise be planted and seats and arbours should be made and the middle of the garden should have a well, a tank or a pond, various other treatises also mention establishing lotus shaped baths, lakes, lotus-shaped seats, swings, roundabouts, Menageries. Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang mentions accounts of Nalanda where &quot;azure pool winds around the monasteries, adorned with the full-blown cups of the blue lotus; the dazzling red flowers of the lovely kanaka hang here and there, and outside groves of mango trees offer the inhabitants their dense and protective shade. There are accounts of four kinds of gardens in Ancient India: &quot;udyan, paramadodvana, vrikshavatika, and nandanavana&quot;. &quot;Vatika&quot; was a small garden inside homes. &quot;Margeshu vriksha&quot; was the practice of planting trees on the roadside for shade.

Manasollasa, a twelfth century text giving details on garden design, asserts that it should include rocks and raised mounds of summits, manicured with plants and trees of diverse varieties, artificial ponds, and flowing brooks. It describes the arrangement, the soils, the seeds, the distance between types of plants and trees, the methods of preparing manure, proper fertilizing and maintaining the garden, which plants and trees are best planted first, when to plant others, watering, signs of overwatering and underwatering, weeds, means of protecting the garden, and other details. Both public parks and woodland gardens are described, with about 40 types of trees recommended for the park in the &quot;Vana-krida&quot; chapter.

In medieval India, courtyard gardens are also essential elements of Mughal and Rajput palaces.

Indian text Shilparatna (16th century AD) states that Pushpavatika (flower garden or public park) should be located in the northern portion of the town. According to Kalidasa, a garden was elaborately laid out with tanks, arbors of creepers, seats (Kridasaila), mock hills, swings in bowers or in open, raised seats, or vedika under large shady tree. Arthashastra, sukraniti, and Kamandakanti mention public gardens which were situated outside the town and provided by the government where people would go and spend whole day in picnic, Panini mentions a kind of garden sport peculiar to eastern India (pracam kridayam), Salabhanjika was the activity of plucking sala flowers and spending the time in merry making. Upavan Vinoda chapter in Sharngadhara-paddhati (14th century AD) an encyclopediac work has been dedicated to horticulture and gardening. Indian gardens were also built around large water reservoirs or water tanks, which were also built along the river.

==== Sri Lankan gardens ====
The water gardens of Sigiriya can be seen in the central section of the western precinct. Three principal gardens are found here. The first garden consists of a plot surrounded by water. It is connected to the main precinct using four causeways, with gateways placed at the head of each causeway. This garden is built according to an ancient garden form known as &quot;char bagh&quot;, and is one of the oldest surviving models of this form.

The second contains two long, deep pools set on either side of the path. Two shallow, serpentine streams lead to these pools. Fountains made of circular limestone plates are placed here. Underground water conduits supply water to these fountains which are still functional, especially during the rainy season. Two large islands are located on either side of the second water garden. Summer palaces are built on the flattened surfaces of these islands. Two more islands are located farther to the north and the south. These islands are built in a manner similar to the island in the first water garden.

The third garden is situated on a higher level than the other two. It contains a large, octagonal pool with a raised podium on its northeast corner. The large brick and stone wall of the citadel is on the eastern edge of this garden.

The water gardens are built symmetrically on an east–west axis. They are connected with the outer moat on the west and the large artificial lake to the south of the Sigiriya rock. All the pools are also interlinked using an underground conduit network fed by the lake, and connected to the moats. A miniature water garden is located to the west of the first water garden, consisting of several small pools and watercourses. This recently discovered smaller garden appears to have been built after the Kashyapan period, possibly between the 10th and 13th centuries.

===Persian gardens===
All Persian gardens, from the ancient to the high classical were developed in opposition to the harsh and arid landscape of the Iranian Plateau. Unlike historical European gardens, which seemed carved or re-ordered from within their existing landscape, Persian gardens appeared as impossibilities. Their ethereal and delicate qualities emphasized their intrinsic contrast to the hostile environment. Trees and trellises largely feature as biotic shade; pavilions and walls are also structurally prominent in blocking the sun.

The heat also makes water important, both in the design and maintenance of the garden. Irrigation may be required, and may be provided via a form of tunnel called a qanat, that transports water from a local aquifer. Well-like structures then connect to the qanat, enabling the drawing of water. Alternatively, an animal-driven Persian well would draw water to the surface. Such wheel systems also moved water around surface water systems, such as those in the chahar bāgh style. Trees were often planted in a ditch called a &quot;juy&quot;, which prevented water evaporation and allowed the water quick access to the tree roots.

The Persian style often attempts to integrate indoors with outdoors through the connection of a surrounding garden with an inner courtyard. Designers often place architectural elements such as vaulted arches between the outer and interior areas to open up the divide between them.

===Egyptian gardens===

Gardens were much cherished in the Egyptian times and were kept both for secular purposes and attached to temple compounds. Gardens in private homes and villas before the New Kingdom were mostly used for growing vegetables and located close to a canal or the river. However, in the New Kingdom they were often surrounded by walls and their purpose incorporated pleasure and beauty besides utility.
Garden produce made out an important part of foodstuff but flowers were also cultivated for use in garlands to wear at festive occasions and for medicinal purposes. While the poor kept a patch for growing vegetables, the rich people could afford gardens lined with sheltering trees and decorative pools with fish and waterfowl. There could be wooden structures forming pergolas to support vines of grapes from which raisins and wine were produced. There could even be elaborate stone kiosks for ornamental reasons, with decorative statues.
Temple gardens had plots for cultivating special vegetables, plants or herbs considered sacred to a certain deity and which were required in rituals and offerings like lettuce to Min. Sacred groves and ornamental trees were planted in front of or near both cult temples and mortuary temples. As temples were representations of heaven and built as the actual home of the god, gardens were laid out according to the same principle. Avenues leading up to the entrance could be lined with trees, courtyards could hold small gardens and between temple buildings gardens with trees, vineyards, flowers and ponds were maintained.

The ancient Egyptian garden would have looked different from a modern garden. It would have seemed more like a collection of herbs or a patch of wild flowers, lacking the specially bred flowers of today. Flowers like the iris, chrysanthemum, lily, and delphinium (blue), were certainly known to the ancients, but were not featured much in garden scenes. Formal bosquets seem to have been composed of mandrake, poppy, cornflower, and/or lotus and papyrus.

Due to the arid climate of Egypt, tending gardens meant constant attention and depended on irrigation. Skilled gardeners were employed by temples and households of the wealthy. Duties included planting, weeding, watering by means of a shadoof, pruning of fruit trees, digging the ground, and harvesting the fruit.

===Hellenistic and Roman gardens===
====Hellenistic gardens====
It is curious that although the Egyptians and Romans both gardened with vigor, the Greeks did not own private gardens. They did put gardens around temples, and they adorned walkways and roads with statues, but the ornate and pleasure gardens that demonstrated wealth in the other communities is seemingly absent.
====Roman gardens====
Roman gardens were a place of peace and solitude, a refuge from urban life. Gaius Maecenas, a culturally influential confidante of the emperor Augustus, built the first private garden estate of Rome to fulfill his creative ambitions and restore his delicate health. Seneca the Younger characterized the gardens&#x27; immersive blend of art, nature, and water as having &quot;diverted his worried mind with the sound of rippling waters.&quot;

Ornamental horticulture became highly developed during the development of Roman civilization. The administrators of the Roman Empire (c.100 BC–500 AD) actively exchanged information on agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, hydraulics, and botany. Seeds and plants were widely shared. The Gardens of Lucullus (Horti Lucullani) on the Pincian Hill on the edge of Rome introduced the Persian garden to Europe in about 60 BC.

===Chinese and Japanese gardens===
Both Chinese and Japanese garden design traditionally is intended to evoke the natural landscape of mountains and rivers. However, the intended viewpoint of the gardens differs: Chinese gardens were intended to be viewed from within the garden and are intended as a setting for everyday life. Japanese gardens, with a few exceptions, were intended to be viewed from within the house, somewhat like a diorama. Moreover, Chinese gardens often included a water feature, while Japanese gardens, set in a wetter climate, would often get by with the suggestion of water (such as sand or pebbles raked into a wave pattern).
Traditional Chinese gardens are also more likely to treat the plants in a naturalistic way, while traditional Japanese gardens might feature plants sheared into mountain or cloud shapes. This contrasts with the handling of stone elements: in a Japanese garden, stepping stones are placed in groupings as part of the landscape, but in a Chinese garden, a particularly choice stone might even be placed on a pedestal in a prominent location so that it might be more easily appreciated.

====Chinese scholar gardens====
The style of Chinese garden varies among economic groups and differs by dynasties. Rocks, water, bridges, and pavilions are among the most common features of scholar gardens for the wealthy classes, while courtyards, wells, and terra cotta fish tanks are common among the general population. Other features such as moon gates and leaky windows (openwork screens that pierce surrounding walls) are seen in both groups.

The development of landscape design in China was historically driven by philosophies of both Confucianism and Taoism. Geometric symmetry and reinforcement of class boundaries were typical characteristics of landscape design in Asian cities, and both characteristics reflect Confucian ideals. While the British used nature outside the home to provide privacy, Chinese homes were compounds made of a number of buildings which all faced one or more courtyards or common areas. Rather than around the home, the Chinese valued natural spaces inside the compound, which is where the family socialized. Furthermore, Courtyards in the Chinese home reflected Taoist philosophies, where families would try to create abstractions of nature rather than recreations of it. For example, a Taoist garden would avoid straight lines and use stone and water instead of trees, whereas Asian cities followed Confucian, geometric designs and North American parks typically feature trees and lawns.

There are two ways of looking at the signature design characteristics of the Chinese garden: first; the concept of Yin and Yang, and second; the myths of longevity that arose during the Qin dynasty.

The philosophy of Yin and Yang portrays the idea of balance and harmony. The Chinese garden expresses the relationship to nature and the idea of balance through the art of mimicking natural setting, thus the existence of mountains, rocks, water, and wind elements. Yin and Yang juxtapose complementary opposites: as hard as rock can be, the softness of water can dissolve it. Lake Tai rocks, limestone eroded by the water of Lake Tai, are the quintessential example. Water, air, and light run through the rock as it sits still on display. The leaky windows of the Chinese garden wall portray both steadiness and movement. The windows create a solid painting on walls, however, that steadiness changes once the wind blows or the eyes move.
Chinese garden&#x27;s structure is based upon the culture&#x27;s creation myth, rooted in rocks and water. To have longevity is to live among mountains and water; it is to live with nature, to live like an immortal being (Xian). The garden evokes a healthy lifestyle that makes one immortal, free from the problems of civilization. Thus, Chinese landscape is known as Shan (mountain) and Shui (water). 

Symbolism is a key element of Chinese garden design. To the earthy tones of the Chinese garden, a touch of red or gold is often added to bring forth the Yin/Yang contrast. The colors red and gold also represent luck and wealth. Bats, dragons, and other mystic creatures carved on wooden doors are also commonly found in Chinese gardens; these are seen as signs of luck and protection.

Circles portray togetherness, especially for family members, and are depicted in moon gates, moon bridges, and round tables placed within square backgrounds. The moon gate and other whimsical doorways also act to frame views and to force the viewer to pause for a transition into a new space.

Paths in Chinese gardens are often uneven and sometimes consciously zigzag. These paths are like the passages of a human life. There is always something new or different when seen from a different angle, while the future is unknown and unpredictable.

===European gardens===
====Gardens of Byzantium====
The Byzantine empire spanned a period of more than 1000 years (330–1453 AD), and a geographic area from modern day Spain and Britain to the Middle East and northern Africa. Probably due to this temporal and geographic spread and its turbulent history, there is no single dominant garden style that can be labeled &quot;Byzantine style&quot;. Archaeological evidence of public, imperial, and private gardens is scant at best, and researchers over the years have relied on literary sources to derive clues about the main features of Byzantine gardens. Romance novels such as &quot;Hysmine and Hysminias&quot; (12th century) included detailed descriptions of gardens and their popularity attests to the Byzantines’ enthusiasm for pleasure gardens (&quot;locus amoenus&quot;). More formal gardening texts, such as the &quot;Geoponika&quot; (10th century), were in fact encyclopaedias of accumulated agricultural practices (grafting, watering) and pagan lore (astrology, plant sympathy/antipathy relationships), going back to Hesiod&#x27;s time. Their repeated publications and translations to other languages well into the 16th century is evidence to the value attributed to the horticultural knowledge of antiquity. These literary sources worked as handbooks, promoting the concepts of walled gardens with plants arranged by type. Such ideals found expression in the suburban parks (Philopation, Aretai) and palatial gardens (Mesokepion, Mangana) of Constantinople.
The Byzantine garden tradition was influenced by the strong undercurrents of history that the empire itself was exposed to. The first and foremost influence was the adoption of Christianity as the empire&#x27;s official religion by its founder Constantine the Great. The new religion signalled a departure from the ornamental pagan sculptures of the Greco-Roman garden style. The second influence was the increasing contact with the Islamic nations of the Middle East, especially after the 9th century. Lavish furnishings in the emperor&#x27;s palace and the adoption of automata in the palatial gardens are evidence of this influence. The third factor was a fundamental shift in the design of the Byzantine cities after the 7th century when they became smaller in size and population as well as more ruralised. The class of wealthy aristocrats who could finance and maintain elaborate gardens probably shrank as well. The final factor was a shifting view toward a more &quot;enclosed&quot; garden space (&quot;hortus conclusus&quot;), a dominant trend in Europe at that time. The open views and vistas so much favored by the garden builders of the Roman villas were replaced by garden walls and scenic views painted on the inside of these walls. The concept of the heavenly paradise was an enclosed garden style that gained popularity during that time and especially after the iconoclastic period (7th century) with the emphasis it placed on divine punishment and repentance.

An area of horticulture that flourished throughout the long history of Byzantium was that practiced by monasteries. Although archaeological evidence has provided limited evidence of monastic horticulture, a great deal can be learned by studying the foundation documents (τυπικόν, typikon) of numerous Christian monasteries, as well as the biographies of saints describing their gardening activities. From these sources, we learn that monasteries maintained monastic gardens outside their walls and watered them with complex irrigation systems fed by springs or rainwater. These gardens contained vineyards, broadleaf vegetables, and fruit trees for the sustenance of monks and pilgrims alike. The role of the gardener was frequently assumed by monks as an act of humility. Monastic horticultural practices established at that time are still in use in Christian monasteries throughout Greece and the Middle East.

====Medieval====

Monasteries carried on a tradition of garden design and intense horticultural techniques during the medieval period in Europe. Rather than any one particular horticultural technique employed, it is the variety of different purposes the monasteries had for their gardens that serves as testament to their sophistication. As for gardening practices, records are limited, and there are no extant monastic gardens that are entirely true to original form. There are, however, records and plans that indicate the types of garden a monastery might have had, such as those for St. Gall in Switzerland.

Generally, monastic garden types consisted of kitchen gardens, infirmary gardens, cemetery orchards, cloister garths and vineyards. Individual monasteries might also have had a &quot;green court&quot;, a plot of grass and trees where horses could graze, as well as a cellarer&#x27;s garden or private gardens for obedientiaries, monks who held specific posts within the monastery.
From a utilitarian standpoint, vegetable and herb gardens helped provide both alimentary and medicinal crops, which could be used to feed or treat the monks and, in some cases, the outside community. As detailed in the plans for St. Gall, these gardens were laid out in rectangular plots, with narrow paths between them to facilitate collection of yields. These beds were often surrounded with wattle fencing to prevent animals from entry. In the kitchen gardens, fennel, cabbage, onion, garlic, leeks, radishes, and parsnips might be grown, as well as peas, lentils, and beans, if space allowed for them. The infirmary gardens could contain &quot;Rosa gallica&quot; (&quot;The Apothecary Rose&quot;), savory, costmary, fenugreek, rosemary, peppermint, rue, iris, sage, bergamot, mint, lovage, fennel, and cumin, amongst other herbs.

The herb and vegetable gardens served a purpose beyond that of production, and that was that their installation and maintenance allowed the monks to fulfil the manual labour component of the religious way of life prescribed by the Rule of St. Benedict.

Orchards also served as sites for food production and as arenas for manual labour, and cemetery orchards, such as that detailed in the plan for St. Gall, showed yet more versatility. The cemetery orchard not only produced fruit, but manifested as a natural symbol of the garden of Paradise. This bi-fold concept of the garden as a space that met both physical and spiritual needs was carried over to the cloister garth.

The cloister garth, a claustrum consisting of the viridarium, a rectangular plot of grass surrounded by peristyle arcades, was barred to the laity, and served primarily as a place of retreat, a locus of the &quot;vita contemplativa&quot;. The viridarium was often bisected or quartered by paths, and often featured a roofed fountain at the centre or side of the garth that served as a primary source for wash water and for irrigation, meeting yet more physical needs. Some cloister gardens contained small fish ponds as well, another source of food for the community. The arcades were used for teaching, sitting and meditating, or for exercise in inclement weather.

There is much conjecture as to ways in which the garth served as a spiritual aid. Umberto Eco describes the green swath as a sort of balm on which a monk might rest weary eyes, so as to return to reading with renewed vigor. Some scholars suggest that, though sparsely planted, plant materials found in the cloister garth might have inspired various religious visions. This tendency to imbue the garden with symbolic values was not inherent to the religious orders alone, but was a feature of medieval culture in general. The square cloister garth was meant to represent the four points of the compass, and so the universe as a whole. As Turner puts it,

Walking around the cloister while meditating was a way of devoting oneself to the &quot;path of life&quot;; indeed, each of the monastic gardens was imbued with symbolic as well as palpable value, testifying to the ingenuity of its creators.

In the later Middle Ages, texts, art, and literary works provide a picture of developments in garden design. During the late 12th to 15th centuries, European cities were walled for internal defense and to control trade. Though space within these walls was limited, surviving documents show that there were animals, fruit trees and kitchen gardens inside the city limits.

Pietro Crescenzi, a Bolognese lawyer, wrote twelve volumes on the practical aspects of farming in the 13th century which offers a description of medieval gardening practices. From his text, we know that gardens were surrounded with stonewalls, thick hedging, or fencing, and incorporated trellises and arbors. They borrowed their form from the square or rectangular shape of the cloister and included square planting beds.

Grass was also first noted in the medieval garden. In the &quot;De Vegetabilibus&quot; of Albertus Magnus, written around 1260, instructions are given for planting grass plots. Raised banks covered in turf called &quot;turf seats&quot; were constructed to provide seating in the garden. Fruit trees were prevalent and often grafted to produce new varieties of fruit. Gardens included a raised mound or mount to serve as a stage for viewing, and planting beds were customarily elevated on raised platforms.

Two works from the late Middle Ages discuss plant cultivation. In the English poem &quot;The Feate of Gardinage&quot; by Jon Gardener and the general household advice given in &quot;Le Ménagier de Paris&quot; of 1393, a variety of herbs, flowers, fruit trees, and bushes were listed with instructions on their cultivation. The Ménagier provides advice by season on sowing, planting, and grafting. The most sophisticated gardening during the Middle Ages was done at the monasteries. Monks developed horticultural techniques and cultivated herbs, fruits, and vegetables. Using the medicinal herbs they grew, monks treated those suffering inside the monastery and in surrounding communities.

During the Middle Ages, gardens were thought to unite the earthly with the divine. The enclosed garden as an allegory for paradise or a &quot;lost Eden&quot; was termed the &quot;hortus conclusus&quot;. Freighted with religious and spiritual significance, enclosed gardens were often depicted in the visual arts, picturing the Virgin Mary, a fountain, a unicorn, and roses inside an enclosed area.

Though Medieval gardens lacked many of the features of the Renaissance gardens that followed them, some of the characteristics of these gardens continue to be incorporated today.
====The Renaissance====

The Italian Renaissance inspired a revolution in private gardening. Renaissance private gardens were full of scenes from ancient mythology and other learned allusions. Water during this time was especially symbolic: it was associated with fertility and the abundance of nature.

The first public gardens were built by the Spanish Crown in the 16th century, in Europe and the Americas.

====French Baroque====

The Garden à la française, or Baroque French gardens, was in the tradition of André Le Nôtre.
The French Classical garden style, or garden à la française, climaxed during the reign of Louis XIV of France (1638–1715) and his head gardener of Gardens of Versailles, André Le Nôtre (1613–1700). The inspiration for these gardens initially came from the Italian Renaissance garden of the 14th and 15th centuries and ideas of French philosopher René Descartes (1576–1650). At this time the French opened the garden up to enormous proportions compared to their Italian predecessor. Their gardens epitomize monarch and &#x27;man&#x27; dominating and manipulating nature to show his authority, wealth, and power.

Renée Descartes, the founder of analytical geometry, believed that the natural world was objectively measurable and that space is infinitely divisible. His belief that &quot;all movement is a straight line therefore space is a universal grid of mathematical coordinates and everything can be located on its infinitely extendable planes&quot; gave us Cartesian mathematics. Through the classical French gardens this coordinate system and philosophy is now given a physical and visual representation.

This French formal and axial garden style placed the house centrally on an enormous and mainly flat property of land. A large central axis that gets narrower further from the main house, forces the viewer&#x27;s perspective to the horizon line, making the property look even larger. The viewer is to see the property as a cohesive whole but at the same time is unable to see all the components of the garden. One is to be led through a logical progression or story and be surprised by elements that aren&#x27;t visible until approached. There is an allegorical story referring to the owner through statues and water features which have mythological references. There are small, almost imperceptible grade changes that help conceal the gardens surprises as well as elongate the gardens views.

These grand gardens have organized spaces meant to be elaborate stages for entertaining the court and guests with plays, concerts and fireworks displays. The following list of garden features were used:

*allée
*axis of symmetry
*bosquet
*broderie
*canal
*cul de sac
*fountains
*gloriette
*grottos with rocaille
*jeux d&#x27;eau
*orangerie
*parterre
*patte d&#x27;oie
*sylvan theater
*tapis vert
*topiary
====Mediterranean gardens====
Due to being an early hub for Western society and being used for centuries, Mediterranean soil was fragile, and one could think of the region&#x27;s landscape culture to be a conflict between fruitfulness and frugality. The area consisted largely of small-scale agricultural plots. Later, following World War II, Mediterranean immigrants brought this agricultural style to Canada, where fruit trees and vegetables in the backyard became common.

====Anglo-Dutch gardens====
*Anglo-Dutch formal gardens

====Picturesque and English Landscape gardens====

Forested areas played a number of roles for the British in the Middle Ages, and one of those roles was to produce game for the gentry. Lords of valuable land were expected to provide a bounty of animals for hunting during royal visits. Despite being in natural locations, forested manor homes could symbolize status, wealth and power if they appeared to have all amenities. After the Industrial Revolution, Britain&#x27;s forest industry shrank until it no longer existed. In response, the Garden City Movement brought urban planning into industrialized areas in the early 20th century to offset negative industrial effects such as pollution.

There were several traditions that influenced English gardening in the 18th century, the first of which was to plant woods around homes. By the mid-17th century, coppice planting became consistent and was considered visually and aesthetically pleasing. Whereas forested areas were more useful for hunting purposes in Britain during the Middle Ages, 18th century patterns demonstrate a further deviation in gardening approach from practicality toward design meant to please the senses.

Likewise, English pleasure grounds were influenced by medieval groves, some of which were still in existence in 18th century Britain. This influence manifested in the form of shrubbery, sometimes organized in mazes or maze-like formations. And though also ancient, shredding became a common characteristic of these early gardens, as the method enabled light to enter the understory. Shredding was used to make garden groves, which ideally included an orchard with fruit trees, fragrant herbs and flowers, and moss-covered pathways.

While the earliest account of a botanical garden was in Pisa in 1543, the first discovered English botanical garden was in Oxford in 1621. Near London, the gardens at Kew was established in 1759. August, dowager princess of Wales worked with well-known botanists of the time, Lord Bute and Stephen Hales, to greatly expand the garden with exotic plants. By 1769, Kew Gardens contained over 3,400 variations of plants.
The picturesque garden style emerged in England in the 18th century, one of the growing currents of the larger Romantic movement. Garden designers like William Kent and Capability Brown emulated the allegorical landscape paintings of European artists, especially Claude Lorraine, Poussin and Salvator Rosa. The manicured hills, lakes and trees dotted with allegorical temples were sculpted into the land.

By the 1790s there was a reaction against these stereotypical compositions; a number of thinkers began to promote the idea of picturesque gardens. The leader of the movement was landscape theorist William Gilpin, an accomplished artist known for his realistic depictions of Nature. He preferred the natural landscape over the manicured and urged designers to respond to the topography of a given site. He also noted that while classical beauty was associated with the smooth and neat, picturesque beauty had a wilder, untamed quality. The picturesque style also incorporated architectural follies—castles, Gothic ruins, rustic cottages—built to add interest and depth to the landscape

Controversy between the picturesque school and proponents of the more manicured garden raged well into the 19th century. Landscape designer Humphry Repton supported Gilpin&#x27;s ideas, particularly that of the garden harmonizing with surrounding landforms. He was attacked in the press by two rival theorists, Richard Payne Knight and Uvedale Price. Repton countered by highlighting the differences between painting and landscape gardening, William Shenstone has been credited with coining the term ‘landscape gardening’. Unlike a painting, the viewer moves through a garden, constantly shifting viewpoints.

The French landscape garden, also called the &quot;jardin anglais&quot; or &quot;jardin pittoresque&quot;, was influenced by contemporary English gardens. Rococo features like Turkish tents and Chinese bridges are prevalent in French gardens in the 18th century. The French Picturesque garden style falls into two categories: those that were staged, almost like theatrical scenery, usually rustic and exotic, called &quot;jardin anglo-chinois&quot;, and those filled with pastoral romance and bucolic sentiment, influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The former style is represented by the Désert de Retz and Parc Monceau, the latter by the Moulin Jolie.

The rusticity found in French picturesque gardens is also derived from admiration of Dutch 17th-century landscape painting and works of the French 18th-century artists Claude-Henri Watelet, François Boucher and Hubert Robert.

English garden is the common term in the English-speaking world for interpretations, derivations, and revivals in the style of the original Landscape Garden examples.

====Gardenesque gardens====

The gardenesque style of English garden design evolved during the 1820s from Humphry Repton&#x27;s Picturesque or &quot;Mixed&quot; style, largely through the efforts of J. C. Loudon, who invented the term.

In a gardenesque plan, all trees, shrubs, and other plants are positioned and managed in such a way that the character of each plant can be displayed to its full potential. With the spread of botany as a suitable subject of study for the enlightened, the gardenesque tended to emphasize botanical curiosities and a collector&#x27;s approach. New plant material that would have seemed bizarre and alien in earlier gardening found settings: pampas grass from Argentina and monkey-puzzle trees from Chile, for example. Winding paths linked scattered plantings. The gardenesque approach involved the creation of small-scale landscapes, dotted with features and vignettes, to promote beauty of detail, variety and mystery, sometimes to the detriment of coherence. Artificial mounds helped to stage groupings of shrubs, and island beds became prominent features.

====Wild gardens and herbaceous borders====

The books of William Robinson describing his own &quot;wild&quot; gardening at Gravetye Manor in Sussex, and the sentimental picture of a rosy, idealized &quot;cottage garden&quot; of the kind pictured by Kate Greenaway, which had scarcely existed historically, both influenced the development of the mixed herbaceous borders that were advocated by Gertrude Jekyll at Munstead Wood in Surrey from the 1890s. Her plantings, which mixed shrubs with perennial and annual plants and bulbs in deep beds within more formal structures of terraces and stairs designed by Edwin Lutyens, set the model for high-style, high-maintenance gardening until the Second World War. Vita Sackville-West&#x27;s garden at Sissinghurst Castle, Kent is the most famous and influential garden of this last blossoming of romantic style, publicized by the gardener&#x27;s own gardening column in &quot;The Observer&quot;. The trend continued in the gardening of Margery Fish at East Lambrook Manor. In the last quarter of the 20th century, less structured wildlife gardening emphasized the ecological framework of similar gardens using native plants. A leading proponent in the United States was the landscape architect Jens Jensen. He designed city and regional parks, and private estates, with a honed aesthetic of art and nature.

===Mesoamerican gardens===
In the Western Hemisphere, various Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Maya, Mixtecs, and Nahua peoples (including the Aztec Empire) had both practical and aesthetic gardening traditions. The Maya made extensive usage of forest gardens for food and medicinal plant production, including with their cities.
The Aztec elite built elaborate pleasure gardens in the Valley of Mexico consisting of various types of plants as well as water features such as aqueduct-fed fountains. Aztec and Maya gardens had a strong focus on fertility, due to their primarily agricultural nature. The Aztecs also had a strong love of flowers, placing great religious, metaphorical, and philosophical significance on them.

===Contemporary gardens===
*Romantic English cottage garden revival
*Modernist gardens
*Naturalistic habitat gardens

In the 20th century, modern design for gardens became important as architects began to design buildings and residences with an eye toward innovation and streamlining the formal Beaux-Arts and derivative early revival styles, removing unnecessary references and embellishment. Garden design, inspired by modern architecture, naturally followed in the same philosophy of &quot;form following function&quot;, thus concerning the many philosophies of plant maturity. In post-war United States people&#x27;s residences and domestic lives became more outdoor oriented, especially in the western states as promoted by &quot;Sunset&quot;, with the backyard often becoming an outdoor room.
Frank Lloyd Wright demonstrated his interpretation for the modern garden by designing homes in complete harmony with natural surroundings. Taliesin and Fallingwater are both examples of careful placement of architecture in nature so the relationship between the residence and surroundings become seamless. His son, Lloyd Wright, trained in architecture and landscape architecture in the Olmsted Brothers office, with his father and with architect Irving Gill. He practiced an innovative organic integration of structure and landscape in his works.

Subsequently, Garrett Eckbo, James Rose, and Dan Kiley – known as the &quot;bad boys of Harvard&quot; – met while studying traditional landscape architecture became notable pioneers in the design of modern gardens. As Harvard embraced modern design in their school of architecture, these designers wanted to interpret and incorporate those new ideas in landscape design. They became interested in developing functional space for outdoor living with designs echoing natural surroundings. Modern gardens feature a fresh mix of curved and architectonic designs and many include abstract art in geometrics and sculpture. Spaces are defined with the thoughtful placement of trees and plantings. Thomas Church work in California was influential through his books and other publications. In Sonoma County, California his 1948 Donnell garden&#x27;s swimming pool, kidney-shaped with an abstract sculpture within it, became an icon of modern outdoor living.

In Mexico Luis Barragán explored a synthesis of International style modernism with native Mexican tradition in private estates and residential development projects such as Jardines del Pedregal and the San Cristobal &#x27;Los Clubes&#x27; Estates in Mexico City. In civic design the Torres de Satélite are urban sculptures of substantial dimensions in Naucalpan, Mexico. His house, studio, and gardens, built in 1948 in Mexico City, was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.

Roberto Burle Marx is accredited with having introduced modernist landscape architecture to Brazil. He was known as a modern nature artist and a public urban space designer. He was landscape architect (as well as a botanist, painter, print maker, ecologist, naturalist, artist, and musician) who designed of parks and gardens in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and in the United States in Florida. He worked with the architects Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer on the landscape design for some of the prominent modernist government buildings in Brazil&#x27;s capitol Brasília.

<text>An investor is a person who allocates financial capital with the expectation of a future return (profit) or to gain an advantage (interest). Through this allocated capital the investor usually purchases some species of property. Types of investments include equity, debt, securities, real estate, infrastructure, currency, commodity, token, derivatives such as put and call options, futures, forwards, etc. This definition makes no distinction between the investors in the primary and secondary markets. That is, someone who provides a business with capital and someone who buys a stock are both investors. An investor who owns stock is a shareholder.

==Types of investors==
There are two types of investors: retail investors and institutional investors.

A &quot;retail investor&quot; is also known as an &quot;individual investor&quot;.

There are several sub-types of institutional investor:
* Pension plans making investments on behalf of employees
* Businesses that make investments, either directly or via a captive fund
* Endowment funds used by universities, churches, etc.
* Mutual funds, hedge funds, and other funds, ownership of which may or may not be publicly traded (these funds typically pool money raised from their owner-subscribers to invest in securities)
* Sovereign wealth funds
* Large money managers

Investors might also be classified according to their profiles. In this respect, an important distinctive investor psychology trait is risk attitude.

==Investor protection through government==
Investor protection through government involves regulations and enforcement by government agencies to ensure that market is fair and fraudulent activities are eliminated. An example of a government agency that protects investors is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which works to protect reasonable investors in the United States.

Similar protections exist in other countries, including the United Kingdom where individual investors have certain protections via the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).

==Investment tax structures==
Company dividends are paid from net income, which has the tax already deducted. Therefore, shareholders are given some respite with a preferential tax rate of 15% on &quot;qualified dividends&quot; in the event of the company being domiciled in the United States. Alternatively, in another country having a double-taxation treaty with the US, accepted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Non-qualified dividends paid by other foreign companies or entities; for example, those receiving income derived from interest on bonds held by a mutual fund, are taxed at the regular and generally higher rate of income tax. When applied to 2013, this is on a sliding scale up to 39.6%, with an additional 3.8% surtax for high-income taxpayers ($200,000 for singles, $250,000 for married couples).

==Role of the financier==
A financier () is a person whose primary occupation is either facilitating or directly providing investments to up-and-coming or established companies and businesses, typically involving large sums of money and usually involving private equity and venture capital, mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, corporate finance, investment banking, or large-scale asset management. A financier makes money through this process when their investment is paid back with interest, from part of the company&#x27;s equity awarded to them as specified by the business deal, or a financier can generate income through commission, performance, and management fees. A financier can also promote the success of a financed business by allowing the business to take advantage of the financier&#x27;s reputation. The more experienced and capable the financier is, the more the financier will be able to contribute to the success of the financed entity, and the greater reward the financier will reap. The term, financier, is French, and derives from &quot;finance&quot; or &quot;payment&quot;.

Financier is someone who handles money. Certain financier avenues require degrees and licenses including venture capitalists, hedge fund managers, trust fund managers, accountants, stockbrokers, financial advisors, or even public treasurers. Personal investing on the other hand, has no requirements and is open to all using the stock market or by word-of-mouth requests for money. A financier &quot;will be a specialized financial intermediary in the sense that it has experience in liquidating the type of firm it is lending to&quot;.

===Perceptions===
Economist Edmund Phelps has argued that the financier plays a role in directing capital to investments that governments and social organizations are constrained from playing:

The concept of the financier has been distinguished from that of a mere capitalist based on the asserted higher level of judgment required of the financier. However, financiers have also been mocked for their perceived tendency to generate wealth at the expense of others, and without engaging in tangible labor. For example, humorist George Helgesen Fitch described the financier as &quot;a man who can make two dollars grow for himself where one grew for someone else before&quot;.

<text>&quot;Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness&quot; is a well-known phrase from the United States Declaration of Independence. The phrase gives three examples of the unalienable rights which the Declaration says have been given to all humans by their Creator, and which governments are created to protect. Like the other principles in the Declaration of Independence, this phrase is not legally binding, but has been widely referenced and seen as an inspiration for the basis of government.

== Origin and phrasing ==

The United States Declaration of Independence was drafted by Thomas Jefferson, and then edited by the Committee of Five, which consisted of Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston. It was then further edited and adopted by the Committee of the Whole of the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. The second paragraph of the first article in the Declaration of Independence contains the phrase &quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness&quot;.

Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;original Rough draught&quot; is on exhibit in the Library of Congress. This version was used by Julian Boyd to create a transcript of Jefferson&#x27;s draft, which reads:

The Committee of Five edited Jefferson&#x27;s draft. Their version survived further edits by the whole Congress intact, and reads:

A number of possible sources of inspiration for Jefferson&#x27;s use of the phrase in the Declaration of Independence have been identified, although scholars debate the extent to which any one of them actually influenced Jefferson. The greatest disagreement comes between those who suggest the phrase was drawn from John Locke and those who more strongly attribute to Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

=== Lockean roots hypothesis ===
In 1689, Locke argued in &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; that political society existed for the sake of protecting &quot;property&quot;, which he defined as a person&#x27;s &quot;life, liberty, and estate&quot;. In &quot;A Letter Concerning Toleration&quot;, he wrote that the magistrate&#x27;s power was limited to preserving a person&#x27;s &quot;civil interest&quot;, which he described as &quot;life, liberty, health, and indolency of body; and the possession of outward things&quot;. He declared in his &quot;Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; that &quot;the highest perfection of intellectual nature lies in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness&quot;.
According to those scholars who saw the root of Jefferson&#x27;s thought in Locke&#x27;s doctrine, Jefferson replaced &quot;estate&quot; with &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot;, although this does not mean that Jefferson meant the &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot; to refer primarily or exclusively to property. Under such an assumption, the Declaration of Independence would declare that government existed primarily for the reasons Locke gave, and some have extended that line of thinking to support a conception of limited government. The &quot;Boston Pamphlet&quot; (1772), the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress (1774), and the Virginia Declaration of Rights (1776) also declare the right to life, liberty and property.

=== Virginia Declaration of Rights ===
The first and second article of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, written by George Mason and adopted unanimously by the Virginia Convention of Delegates on June 12, 1776, speaks of happiness in the context of recognizably Lockean rights and is paradigmatic of the way in which &quot;the fundamental natural rights of mankind&quot; were expressed at the time: &quot;That all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.&quot;
Benjamin Franklin was in agreement with Thomas Jefferson in playing down the protection of &quot;property&quot; as a goal of government. It is noted that Franklin found the property to be a &quot;creature of society&quot; and thus, he believed that it should be taxed as a way to finance civil society.

=== Alternative hypotheses ===
In 1628, Sir Edward Coke wrote in &quot;The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England&quot;, his commentary on Thomas de Littleton, that &quot;It is commonly said that three things be favoured in Law, Life, Liberty, Dower.&quot; At common law, dower was closely guarded as a means by which the widow and orphan of a deceased landowner could keep their real property.

Jefferson&#x27;s phrase may be specifically based on his Epicureanism. In his Letter to William Short, Jefferson said: &quot;As you say of yourself, I too am an Epicurean. I consider the genuine (not the imputed) doctrines of Epicurus as containing every thing rational in moral philosophy which Greece and Rome have left us.&quot; The 29th of Epicurus&#x27; 40 Principal Doctrines (on the hierarchy of desires) states that desires may be natural and necessary, natural and unnecessary, or neither natural nor necessary. Jefferson may have been enshrining a version of the &quot;natural and necessary&quot; category of desires into the social contract of his new country. In his Letter to Menoeceus, Epicurus of Samos stated &quot;that among the necessary desires some are necessary for happiness, some for physical health, and some for life itself&quot;. Although the Declaration of Independence does not mention health, this may be included under &quot;life&quot;, and liberty and autarchy are cardinal values of Epicurean philosophy.

Garry Wills has argued that Jefferson did not take the phrase from Locke and that it was indeed meant to be a standard by which governments should be judged. Wills suggests Adam Ferguson as a good guide to what Jefferson had in mind: &quot;If, in reality, courage and a heart devoted to the good of mankind are the constituents of human felicity, the kindness which is done infers a happiness in the person from whom it proceeds, not in him on whom it is bestowed; and the greatest good which men possessed of fortitude and generosity can procure to their fellow creatures is a participation of this happy character. If this be the good of the individual, it is likewise that of mankind; and virtue no longer imposes a task by which we are obliged to bestow upon others that good from which we ourselves refrain; but supposes, in the highest degree, as possessed by ourselves, that state of felicity which we are required to promote in the world.&quot;

The 17th-century cleric and philosopher Richard Cumberland wrote that promoting the well-being of our fellow humans is essential to the &quot;pursuit of our own happiness&quot;. Locke never associated natural rights with happiness, but his philosophical opponent Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz made such an association in the introduction to his &quot;Codex Iuris Gentium&quot;. William Wollaston&#x27;s &quot;The Religion of Nature Delineated&quot; describes the &quot;truest definition&quot; of &quot;natural religion&quot; as being &quot;&quot;The pursuit of happiness&quot; by the practice of reason and truth&quot;. An English translation of Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Natural and Politic Law&quot; prepared in 1763 extolled the &quot;noble pursuit&quot; of &quot;true and solid happiness&quot; in the opening chapter discussing natural rights. Historian Jack Rakove posits Burlamaqui as a source in addition to Locke as inspiration for Jefferson&#x27;s phrase.

Another possible source for the phrase is in the &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; published by Sir William Blackstone, from 1765 to 1769, which are often cited in the laws of the United States. Blackstone argues that God &#x27;has so intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual, that the latter cannot be attained but by observing the former; and, if the former be punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter. In consequence of which mutual connection of justice and human felicity, he has not perplexed the law of nature with a multitude of abstracted rules and precepts, referring merely to the fitness or unfitness of things, as some have vainly surmised; but has graciously reduced the rule of obedience to this one paternal precept, “that man should pursue his own true and substantial happiness.” This is the foundation of what we call ethics, or natural law.&#x27;

== Comparable mottos worldwide ==
The phrase is similar to a line in the Canadian Charter of Rights: &quot;life, liberty, security of the person&quot; (this line was also in the older Canadian Bill of Rights, which added &quot;enjoyment of property&quot; to the list).

The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan, Chapter II, Article 10 of the 1987 Constitution of South Korea, and in President Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. An alternative phrase &quot;life, liberty, and property&quot;, is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. 

The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments cannot deprive any person of &quot;life, liberty, or property&quot; without due process of law. Also, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads, &quot;Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person&quot;.

<text>Herzeleid (; &quot;Heartbreak&quot;) is the debut studio album by German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein, first released on 25 September 1995 via Motor Music.

==Production and writing==
After signing up with Motor Music, the band was instructed to search for a producer, a position they didn&#x27;t even know about since it wasn&#x27;t usual in East Germany. They first suggested Bob Rock and Rick Rubin, but the label asked them to be less ambitious. The role was ultimately assigned to Jacob Hellner, known for his work with Clawfinger.

Guitarist Richard Kruspe recalls the band&#x27;s struggle during their time in Stockholm, Sweden, where the album was recorded at Polar Studios and Hellner&#x27;s own studio, BomKrash. Because there wasn&#x27;t a language that both members and producer could speak, the band couldn&#x27;t properly express their disapproval of the way Hellner was making them sound. This was solved with the help of Dutch engineer Ronald Prent, who served as a middleman between Rammstein and Hellner.

It took them seven days to finish the first song, due to the band&#x27;s constant disapproval of Hellner&#x27;s and Prent&#x27;s inputs. In a 2019 interview to &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; Prent said every time there was a decision to be made, the members would host what he called a &quot;German Conference&quot; – outdoor meetings that could last from ten minutes to two hours until all six members reached an agreement. Despite the minor setback, Hellner continued to work with Rammstein for 14 years, producing five more albums until 2009&#x27;s &quot;Liebe ist für alle da.&quot;

The first song written for this album was &quot;Rammstein&quot;, which was also the first song ever written by the band. The last song to be written was most likely &quot;Asche zu Asche&quot; since it was not played at their concerts in 1994, unlike all the other songs. A few songs were written in English before they were translated into German. There are also songs from that era that did not make it onto the album, including:

# &quot;Jeder lacht&quot; (the lyrics of the first verse were later re-used for the chorus of &quot;Adios&quot; from &quot;Mutter&quot;)
# &quot;Schwarzes Glas&quot;
# &quot;Wilder Wein&quot; (later released as a demo version on &quot;Engel: Fan-Edition&quot;, a finished live version appeared on &quot;Live aus Berlin&quot;)
# &quot;Alter Mann&quot; (later released on &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; with new music and slightly different lyrics)
# &quot;Feuerräder&quot; (later released on &quot;Engel: Fan-Edition&quot;, still in demo phase)
# &quot;Tier&quot; (1994) (also referred to as &quot;Biest&quot;, a fanmade title. Not to be confused with the later released &quot;Tier&quot; from &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;)
# &quot;Tiefer&quot; (working name for &quot;Jeder lacht&quot;)
# &quot;Sadist&quot; (performed once under this name, at a concert on 11 October 1996 in Magdeburg, Germany; was released under &quot;Tier&quot; on the album &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;)

==Title and packaging==
The album&#x27;s title translates as &quot;heartbreak&quot;, and it reflects personal problems that every band member was going through around the time of the album&#x27;s preparation, particularly Kruspe and vocalist Till Lindemann, who were breaking up with their respective girlfriends.

The original cover caused controversy when it was originally revealed. It shows the band topless and sweaty. The press said Rammstein depicted themselves in this image as &quot;Herrenmenschen&quot;. Guitarist Kruspe said: &quot;Das ist völliger Quatsch, das ist einfach nur ein Foto&quot; (&quot;Totally stupid. It&#x27;s just a photo&quot;). He did however express his embarrassment in 2016 saying that the band looked &quot;gay...like an ad for a gay porno film.&quot; Lindemann added, that it was a quick shot on a parking lot somewhere in Berlin. North American versions had a different cover, consisting of the band members&#x27; faces from the inside of the original booklet, placed side by side.

Rammstein&#x27;s first commercial logo was made for Herzeleid by Dirk Rudolph. This variation uses a thinner &quot;T&quot; character than what is used in later logos.

==Release==
*&quot;Herzeleid&quot; was released on CD in many countries; the US and Canadian versions had alternative front covers, and were released by Slash Records, but still retained the same songs as on the German version. XIII Bis Records in France released Herzeleid on CD, as well as most of Rammstein&#x27;s releases before 1999.
*Some editions of the Herzeleid CD were censored. Some copies had the words &quot;Schulhof&quot; (school yard) and &quot;töten&quot; (kill) beeped out during &quot;Weisses Fleisch&quot;, and other versions had these words removed from the CD&#x27;s lyric booklet, but not from the song itself.
*South Korean CDs excluded the song &quot;Das alte Leid&quot; from the tracklist and booklet, although the track is still on the CD.
*Countries such as South Korea, Poland, Germany and the US (among others) produced commercial cassettes for the album. European countries received cassettes featuring the original cover, but US cassettes featured the different cover that they also used on CDs.
*A very scarce number of German CDs were released with stickers to promote Rammstein&#x27;s concert on 27 September 1996 slotted in the back of the case, in front of the insert artwork.
*A Motor Music pre-release cassette of the album was issued; there are two different variations of this tape, but the only difference is the appearance of the eszett (ß) character used in the title of &quot;Weisses Fleisch&quot;.
*The first time &quot;Herzeleid&quot; has ever been released on vinyl was on the XXI boxset, and the subsequently released individual LPs from said boxset.
*A remastered version of the album was released on 4 December 2020.
*Sales of the next album &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; helped lift figures for &quot;Herzeleid&quot;, according to keyboardist Christian Lorenz. The band&#x27;s debut album went gold five years after their second did.

==Reception and legacy==

In 2005, &quot;Herzeleid&quot; was ranked number 303 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

Kruspe reflected in 2016 saying it was not among his favorite albums:

<text>Mutter (; English: &quot;Mother&quot;) is the third studio album by German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein. It was released on 2 April 2001 through Motor and Universal Music. The album&#x27;s cover image is a photograph of a dead fetus, which was taken by Daniel &amp; Geo Fuchs. The album has yielded six singles which, to date, are the most released from any Rammstein album.
== Writing and recording ==
From September to December 1999, the band rented the house Weimar in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea for pre-production. The sound recordings took place in May and June 2000 at Studio Miraval in southern France. In advance of the album&#x27;s release, Rammstein released the song &quot;Links 2 3 4&quot; on their website for download in December 2000. The single &quot;Sonne&quot; was released in January 2001.

==Critical reception and legacy==

In 2005, &quot;Mutter&quot; was ranked number 324 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

In a 2016 article published by uDiscover, Oran O&#x27;Beirne described the album as &quot;one of the most important contemporary releases within heavy metal’s many subgenres.&quot;

In the interview with Noizr Zine, the well-known Swedish producer and musician Peter Tägtgren advised &quot;Mutter&quot; as a reference work for beginner producers: 
&quot;I think, if you are not into death metal or something like that, but if you are into metal, I would say maybe Rammstein’s &quot;Mutter&quot; is very good, because it has a lot of different elements, it has orchestra parts, heavy guitars, good drum sound — that could be a good reference.&quot;

==Track listing==
There are various editions of &quot;Mutter&quot;, each with different features:
*The Limited Tour Edition had the same cover, but red with the Rammstein logo embossed on the front. It also had a second CD with the following live tracks:
# &quot;Ich will&quot; – 3:57
# &quot;Links 2 3 4&quot; – 4:54
# &quot;Sonne&quot; – 4:42
# &quot;Spieluhr&quot; – 5:27
*The Japanese edition had &quot;Halleluja&quot; as a hidden track, found after &quot;Nebel&quot; (there is a two-minute intermission of silence). The track was later included in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; soundtrack, but does not appear in the film.
*The limited edition had a second CD with just one track, &quot;Halleluja&quot;, and a CD-ROM area featuring the &quot;Sonne&quot; video. There is a spelling error on the back album track listing: it is listed as &quot;Hallelujah&quot; but the bonus CD itself has the song listed as &quot;Halleluja&quot;, which is the correct spelling.
*A 12&quot; vinyl version and a MC version were released, with the same track list (Side A = 1–6; B = 7–11)
*The Limited Tour Edition was also released as a double cassette set, with the second cassette containing the live tracks (Side A = 1–2; B = 3–4).
*The Turkish cassette release of the album fades all songs out at 3:44.

Note: Some copies that have &quot;Halleluja&quot; as a hidden track can not be played for unknown reasons. On 3 April 2010 Rammstein posted a video with an official translation of &quot;Halleluja&quot; on their Facebook page, &quot;in light of recent events&quot;.

<text>Erichthonius (; Ancient Greek: Ἐριχθόνιος) was a king of Troy in Greek mythology. He was the son of Dardanus and Batea (in some other legends his mother is said to be, Olizone, daughter of Phineus). He was the brother of Ilus and Zacynthus. Erichthonius was said to have enjoyed a peaceful and prosperous reign.

== Etymology ==
Erichthonius is of uncertain etymology, possibly related to a pre-Greek form *&quot;Erektyeu-&quot;. The connection of Ἐριχθόνιος with ἐρέχθω, &quot;shake&quot; is a late folk-etymology; other folk-etymologies include ἔριον, &quot;erion&quot;, &quot;wool&quot; or &quot;eris&quot;, &quot;strife&quot;+ χθών &quot;chthôn or chthonos&quot;, &quot;earth&quot;.

== Mythology ==
Fundamentally, all that is known of this Erichthonius comes from Homer, who says (Samuel Butler&#x27;s translation of &quot;Iliad&quot; 20.215-234):

: In the beginning Dardanos was the son of Zeus, and founded Dardania, for Ilion was not yet established on the plain for men to dwell in, and her people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained Ida. Dardanos had a son, king Erichthonios, who was wealthiest of all men living; he had three thousand mares that fed by the water-meadows, they and their foals with them. Boreas was enamored of them as they were feeding, and covered them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. Twelve filly foals did they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped over the fertile plain, would go bounding on over the ripe ears of wheat and not break them; or again when they would disport themselves on the broad back of Ocean they could gallop on the crest of a breaker. Erichthonios begat Tros, king of the Trojans, and Tros had three noble sons, Ilos, Assarakos, and Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the gods carried him off to be Zeus&#x27; cupbearer, for his beauty&#x27;s sake, that he might dwell among the immortals.

John Tzetzes and one of the scholia to Lycophron call his wife Astyoche, the naiad daughter of the river-god Simoeis. The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; also adds Erichthonius&#x27; older brother Ilus, who died young and childless; presumably a doublet of the other Ilus, grandson of Erichthonius, eponym of Troy. In one account, Erichthonius was said to be the father of Ganymede.

Strabo records, but discounts, the claim by &quot;some more recent writers&quot; that Teucer came from the deme of Xypeteones in Attica, supposedly called &quot;Troes&quot; (meaning Trojans) in mythical times. These writers mentioned that Erichthonius appears as founder both in Attica and the Troad, and may be identifying the two.

Erichthonius reigned for forty six or, according to others, sixty five years and was succeeded by his son Tros.

<doc id="332748" wikidata="Q644921" url="?curid=332748" title="Erichthonius (son of Hephaestus)">
<text>In Greek mythology, King Erichthonius (; ) was a legendary early ruler of ancient Athens. According to some myths, he was autochthonous (born of the soil, or Earth) and adopted or raised by the goddess Athena. Early Greek texts do not distinguish between him and Erechtheus, his grandson, but by the fourth century BC, during Classical times, they are distinct figures.

== Etymology ==
Erichthonius of uncertain etymology is possibly related to a pre-Greek form *&quot;Erekteu-&quot;. The connection of with ἐρέχθω, &quot;shake&quot; is a late folk-etymology; other folk-etymologies include , &quot;erion&quot;, &quot;wool&quot; or , &quot;eris&quot;, &quot;strife&quot;+ &quot;chthôn&quot;, &quot;earth&quot;.

== Mythology ==

===Birth===

According to the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, Athena visited the smith-god Hephaestus to request some weapons, but Hephaestus was so overcome by desire that he tried to seduce her in his workshop. Determined to maintain her virginity, Athena fled, pursued by Hephaestus. He caught Athena and tried to rape her, but she fought him off. During the struggle, his semen fell on her thigh, and Athena, in disgust, wiped it away with a scrap of wool (, &quot;erion&quot;) and flung it to the earth (, &quot;chthôn&quot;). As she fled, Erichthonius was born from the semen that fell to the earth. Athena, wishing to raise the child in secret, placed him in a small box and then made sure no one would ever find out by giving him away.

Athena gave the box to the three daughters (Herse, Aglaurus and Pandrosus) of Cecrops, the king of Athens, and warned them never to look inside. Pandrosus obeyed, but Herse and Aglaurus were overcome with curiosity and opened the box, containing the infant and future-king, Erichthonius (&quot;troubles born from the earth,&quot; following another etymology). (Sources are unclear regarding how many sisters participated.) The sisters were terrified by what they saw in the box: Either a snake coiled around an infant, or an infant that was half-human and half-serpent. They went insane and threw themselves off the Acropolis. Other accounts state that the snake killed them.

An alternative version of the story is that Athena left the box with the daughters of Cecrops while she went to fetch a limestone mountain from the Pallene peninsula to use in the Acropolis. While she was away, Aglaurus and Herse opened the box. A crow saw them open the box, and flew away to tell Athena, who fell into a rage and dropped the mountain she was carrying which became Mount Lycabettus. As in the first version, Herse and Aglaurus went insane and threw themselves to their deaths off a cliff.

=== Reign ===
When he grew up, Erichthonius drove out Amphictyon, who had usurped the throne from Cranaus twelve years earlier, and became king of Athens. He married Praxithea, a naiad, with whom he had a son, . During this time, Athena frequently protected him. He founded the Panathenaic Festival in the honor of Athena, and set up a wooden statue of her on the Acropolis. According to the Parian Chronicle, he taught his people to yoke horses and use them to pull chariots, to smelt silver, and to till the earth with a plough.

It was said that Erichthonius was lame of his feet and that he consequently invented the quadriga, or four-horse chariot, to get around more easily. He is said to have competed often as a chariot driver in games. Zeus was said to have been so impressed with his skill that he raised him to the heavens to become the constellation of the Charioteer (Auriga) after his death.

The snake is his symbol, and he is represented in the statue of Athena in the Parthenon as the snake hidden behind her shield. The most sacred building on the Acropolis of Athens, the Erechtheum, is dedicated to Erichthonius.

Erichthonius was succeeded by his son Pandion I.

It was recorded at Don Zientara&#x27;s Inner Ear Studios in Arlington, VA and the Dischord House between January and April 2001. It was the band&#x27;s last release (simultaneously with &quot;Furniture&quot;) before going on hiatus in 2003, until the release of &quot;First Demo&quot; over thirteen years later.

Upon release, &quot;The Argument&quot; was met with critical and commercial success. Many critics have called it the band&#x27;s best album as well as one of the most important releases in the post-hardcore genre.

==Background and meaning==
&quot;The Argument&quot; saw Fugazi continue to expand upon the more experimental art punk leanings of &quot;Red Medicine&quot; and &quot;End Hits&quot; while also heavily incorporating other instruments, such as piano and cello into their sound. The album also featured the first extensive contributions from outside musicians, most notably longtime stage-tech Jerry Busher, who added percussion on a second drum set to several of the album&#x27;s songs as well as Kathi Wilcox of Bikini Kill and Bridget Cross of Unrest who provided additional backing vocals.

When asked about the meaning of the album&#x27;s title by &quot;Guitar World&quot; in a 2001 interview, singer/guitarist Ian MacKaye described it (and the song title from which the album name comes), as &quot;an anti-war manifesto.&quot; MacKaye expanded upon this by stating, &quot;A main point of the song is that I will not agree with war across the board. It also talks about a greater argument: that these giant airplanes are dropping tons of homicidal weaponry, blowing the shit out of everybody, and guys are running around with guns. And that is an argument of colossal scale.&quot;

==Writing and recording==
The band began work on &quot;The Argument&quot; in 1999, after touring in support of &quot;End Hits&quot;. This process saw the group taking more time than usual to write and demo material. Each member brought their own individual riffs and ideas to the band, jam on them, and then begin piecing the songs together into various configurations before deciding on what became the final versions.

In some cases, the group picked apart songs that were already written to form completely new works. When asked about this process, and the track &quot;Epic Problem&quot; in particular, singer/guitarist Guy Picciotto explained to &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; in 2002 &quot;This time, for some reason, we just came up with a new idea for it. The whole verse for that song is different from what we had before, and then suddenly, the chorus. It&#x27;s like Lego&#x27;s. I mean, that&#x27;s really the way that we work. We assemble stockpiles of parts and ideas and then we just kind of just keep clicking them together until something works. There&#x27;s a song, &quot;Full Disclosure,&quot; and there&#x27;s a song, &quot;Strangelight&quot;; for a long time, they were the same song. But if you listen to the record, they don&#x27;t sound anything alike. It&#x27;s hard to imagine that they could ever have been linked, but for a long time they were.&quot; Other tracks, such as &quot;The Kill&quot; were arranged entirely in the studio.

The album&#x27;s recording sessions took place between January and April 2001 at Inner Ear Studios and Dischord House in Arlington, Virginia, west of Washington D.C. The band once again worked with producer/engineer Don Zientara. During the recording process a considerable amount of time was spent finalizing each song&#x27;s production, in particular the album&#x27;s drum tracks, in an effort to give the album a unique feel. Drummer Brendan Canty explained to &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; that &quot;We recorded them all very differently in terms of the drum sounds. We used a lot of different drum kits, cymbals, snares, and miking techniques.

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s cover features a photographic illustration composed of two tightly cropped images of what appears to be a bronze relief plaque: two arms of justice extended in opposite directions, one with a torch in-hand and the other empty. The CD insert has two silver folds that open to reveal a booklet which includes a picture of a plaque memorializing Kent State shooting victim Sandra Lee Scheuer, with her name and the date of her death; May 4, 1970 engraved upon it. When asked about the meaning of the cover in a 2001 interview, Picciotto offered the following; &quot;You&#x27;ll understand the meaning in time. It&#x27;s like a chemical—you put it out there and the reaction that it creates is what art is.&quot;

==Release and reception==
In April 2001, the band toured the US. &quot;The Argument&quot; was released by Dischord Records on October 16, 2001, along with their EP, &quot;Furniture&quot;, almost four years after the release of &quot;End Hits&quot;. Arion Berger of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;bracing&quot; and &quot;intellectual&quot;, while Chris True of AllMusic referred to the album as &quot;ear-shattering and spine-tingling at once&quot; and stated that &quot;the band has raised the bar for themselves and others once again.&quot; He also noted that the album had &quot;touched on strange new territory.&quot; Overall critical response to &quot;The Argument&quot; was very positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 87, based on 20 reviews.

===Legacy and accolades===

&quot;The Argument&quot; continued to receive acclaim, appearing on a number of year-end lists including those of Pitchfork, &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, The A.V. Club, and many others. The following year, &quot;Spin&quot; wrote that with the album, &quot;Fugazi accomplished the rare feat of producing their best album almost 15 years into their career.&quot; In 2008, Turner Prize-nominated artist Mark Titchner ranked &quot;The Kill&quot; #1 on his list of the top 10 songs about liberty. The end of the decade saw many (predominantly US) publications including the album on their lists of the best albums of the decade.

In 2012, Stereogum ranked it the band&#x27;s best album, writing: &quot;If &quot;post-punk&quot; were a descriptive term rather than a genre invented by journalists, &quot;The Argument&quot; might be one of the only albums worthy of such a distinction. [...] Only after repeat listens does the album emerge as a definitive statement alongside &quot;Daydream Nation&quot;, &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;, or &quot;Kid A&quot;. Weird, wonky and wonderful, &quot;The Argument&quot; is Fugazi&#x27;s masterpiece.&quot; The album was positively re-evaluated by many sources prior to the release of &quot;First Demo&quot; in 2014. The band was included on Consequence of Sound&#x27;s list of &quot;10 Artists Who Went Out on Their Best Album&quot;, with the website writing that &quot;The Argument&quot; &quot;opens up and reveals itself as a blossoming of the band’s entire career output, shot through with piano, cello, and (yes) acoustic guitar driving some of the fiercest songs Guy Picciotto or MacKaye have wrought together or apart.&quot; In an op-ed on the band, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; wrote that &quot;[t]heir last (not final; remember they’re on hiatus) album [...] found Fugazi as vital, relevant and tuneful than ever. And then that was it: The screen went blank, without build-up or forewarning, as quiet as that album’s title track.&quot; &quot;[I]f their first two EPs and &quot;Repeater&quot; were propaganda to some — releases that commanded the listener to do or not do certain things —&quot; observed Tiny Mix Tapes, &quot;then &quot;The Argument&quot; was a question mark to all, inviting listeners to hear the band’s point of view and get them to think for themselves.&quot;

In 2020, Brooklyn Vegan included it on their list of &quot;15 albums that defined the 2000s post-hardcore boom&quot;, writing that the album &quot;didn&#x27;t sound like &quot;Repeater&quot; or &quot;Waiting Room&quot; or like any of the new post-hardcore in 2001, but it sounded fresh and it fit right in with the younger bands who owed their careers to Fugazi.&quot; &quot;Las Vegas Weekly&quot; ranked the album as one of their favorites from the past 20 years.

<text>Ice fishing is the practice of catching fish with lines and fish hooks or spears through an opening in the ice on a frozen body of water. Ice fishers may fish in the open or in heated enclosures, some with bunks and amenities.

==Shelters==

Longer fishing expeditions can be mounted with simple structures. Larger, heated structures can make multiple day fishing trips possible. A structure with various local names, but often called an ice shanty, ice shack, fish house, shack, icehouse, bobhouse, or ice hut, is sometimes used. These are dragged or towed onto the lake using a vehicle such as a snowmobile, ATV or truck. The two most commonly used types are portable and permanent. The portable houses are often made of a heavy material that is usually watertight. The two most common types of portable houses are those with a shelter that flips behind the user when not needed, or pop up shelters with a door as the only way out. The permanent shelters are made of wood or metal and usually have wheels for easy transport. They can be as basic as a bunk heater and holes or have satellite television, bathrooms, stoves, full-size beds and may appear to be more like a mobile home than a fishing house.
In North America, ice fishing is often a social activity. Some resorts have fish houses that are rented out by the day; often, shuttle service by Snow Track or other vehicles modified to drive on ice is provided. In North America, portable houses appear to create a city at locations where fishing is done.
==Fishing equipment==
Ice fishing gear is highly specialized. An ice saw, ice auger or chisel is used to cut a circular or rectangular hole in the ice. The size of the hole depends on the type of fish sought, generally suggested is 8 inches (20 cm). Power augers are sometimes used. If these tools are not available, an axe may be used to chop the hole. A skimmer, a large metal spoon with holes in it, is used to remove new ice as it forms and to clear slush left from making the hole. During colder periods most ice anglers choose to carry a heater of some type. The heater is not only for warmth but also for keeping an angler&#x27;s fishing hole from freezing. When temperatures fall to -20 °F (-29 °C) or colder it becomes very hard to keep a fishing hole open.

Three main types of fishing occur. The first is using a small, light fishing rod with small, brightly coloured lures or jigs with bait such as wax worms, fat heads or crappie or shiner minnows. The angler sits at the hole in the ice and lifts the pole every now and then, producing the jig effect.

The second is using tip-ups, which are made of wood or plastic, and have a spool of line attached, with a thin piece of metal that goes from the spool to the flag. Black line is put on the spool and a swivel is placed at the end of the black line. Then a piece of fishing line with a hook is attached to the swivel. Worms, power bait, grub worms or small minnows are placed on the hook. The hook with bait is placed into the water under the ice. The depth that the bait is placed goes according to several theories. One theory is the bait is placed one meter under the ice. The second is that the bait is placed two to three metres under the ice. The third is that the bait is suspended one foot (30 cm) above the bottom of the lake. When the fish strikes the bait the flag is lifted which notifies the angler that a fish is on the hook. The angler pulls the line in and the fish fights. The angler will allow the line to slip through their hands during the struggle. Finally, when the angler can get the fish&#x27;s head into the hole in the ice, the fish is quickly lifted onto the ice. This allows for less-intensive fishing.
The third method is spear fishing. A large hole is cut in the ice and fish decoys may be deployed. The angler sits in a dark ice shanty called a dark house. The angler then peers into the water while holding a large spear which has four or five points. A line can be attached to the points. The fisher waits for fish to appear, then plunges the spear into the water. This method is often used for lake sturgeon fishing. In the United States many states allow only rough fish to be taken while spear fishing.

Becoming increasingly popular is the use of a flasher, similar to its summer cousin the fishfinder. This is a sonar system that provides depth information, as well as indicating the presence of fish or other objects. These flashers, unlike most typical fishfinders, display the movement of fish and other objects almost instantaneously. The bait being used can often be seen as a mark on the flasher, enabling the angler to position the bait right in front of the fish. Underwater cameras are also now available which allow the user to view the fish and observe their reaction to the lure presentation.

Clubbing is an old method seldom used today, mainly used on burbot, the fisher walks on clear ice in shallow water and sees a large fish through the ice and with a large club which they slam into the ice, the shockwave hits the fish and it is temporary paralyzed, which gives the fisher time to cut a hole in the ice to collect the fish.

==Ice fishing on ice==


Ice fishing methods have changed drastically over the past 20 years. The name of the game is mobility for today&#x27;s modern ice anglers. The days of drilling hole, waiting and hoping that a fish will swim by, are starting to fade. With light gear, battery-operated sonar units, and fast and powerful augers, an angler can conceivably drill and check hundreds of holes in a single day. When the fish stop biting where they are, anglers can move to the next hole, checking it with their sonar first to look for activity, and if there are no fish they will keep moving until fish are found. In addition, schools of fish tend to move around; so a hole may be productive for 10 minutes and then slow down to nothing for an hour before a school returns to that location. This &quot;fish where the fish are&quot; technique and ease of mobility increases the catch rate of any angler, because it minimizes the wait between bites, similar to &quot;trolling&quot; in the summer months.

Anglers can now use many available maps and surveys to help pinpoint lakes and areas within those lakes that make sense to try for specific fish, noting those locations in latitude and longitude coordinates. They are then able to use a handheld GPS receiver to aim them to those spots, usually with accuracy of less than 20 feet. Ice anglers then drill holes with whichever auger they have, checking the ice thickness for safety as they go. Most ice fishers advise checking that the ice is at least 4 inches thick. Using sonar, the angler can determine the depth of the water, bottom content, weed and structure cover, and even see if there are fish there. Also, by using sonar, they can place the bait according to where they think the fish are. If they are using &quot;tip-ups&quot; they can carpet the area at different depths and with different presentations (the number allowed being determined by local laws) and see what is the most productive. Modern ice anglers can also use modern reels mounted on shorter (18&quot;-36&quot;/45–90 cm long) fishing rods to actively fish by watching, by using their sonar, where their lure is relative to the fish, and jig accordingly to entice a bite.

Ice fishing can be done at any time of day, and is typically most active around dusk and dawn. Different fish are active at different times of day, so anglers need to fish for them accordingly. There are fish houses large enough and comfortable enough to spend many days in a row out on the lake, fishing the entire time. One can even fish in one&#x27;s sleep, by using audible alarms on one&#x27;s lines to tell when a fish is biting. There are also many lightweight and highly mobile portable shelters that mount on plastic sleds and collapse for transportation. These can vary from small, one-person shelters (commonly called &quot;Fish Traps&quot;) to large and complex shelters able to fit up to 20 people at once.

==Dangers and safety precautions==

=== Ice thickness and type ===
There are many variables which dictate whether or not ice is safe to walk on, however there are some widely accepted parameters. For example, newly frozen ice is always safer than older ice. &quot;Good ice&quot; is ice which has frozen without the interruption of large temperature fluctuations, rain, or snow and is clear and free of large lumps and cracks. Additionally, the safest ice is that which sits upon a lake without moving water. Ice on the surface of rivers can be extremely unpredictable.
Many anglers will go out with as little as 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) of &quot;good ice&quot; for walking on. The recommended thickness of ice to support an average person is 4 inches (10 cm), 5-6 inches (13–15 cm) for sleds (snow machines, snowmobiles) and most ATVs, 7-12 inches (18–30 cm) for light cars, and large ATVs and a minimum of 14 inches (36–41 cm) for full-sized trucks. Thinner ice in areas with swift surface currents are a significant hazard, as is ice that is directly over underwater spring.

=== Hazards to ice ===

Offshore winds can break off pans of ice which are miles wide, stranding large numbers of fishers. Just such a circumstance occurred in Lake Erie in February 2009, with 100 fishers having to be rescued by helicopters, local authorities, and the Coast Guard. One man who had fallen into the water died on the rescue flight. On March 28, 2013, as many as 220 ice anglers were trapped on break-away sea ice floes in the Gulf of Riga (Latvia), necessitating a full-scale rescue operation which employed helicopters and hovercraft. Many similar operations—although typically much smaller in scale—are required each year due to reckless and/or inexperienced anglers.

Late-winter warm spells can destroy the texture of the ice, which, while still of the required thickness, will not adequately support weight. It is called &quot;rotten ice&quot; or soft ice and is exceedingly dangerous. Some ice anglers will continue to fish, since even with the bad ice normally 8 inches (20 cm) is more than enough. Ice anglers may carry a self-rescue device called an ″ice pick″ made of two spiked handles connected by a string to pull themselves out of the water and onto the ice.

=== Hazards to people ===
Many cars, trucks, SUVs, snowmobiles, and fish houses fall through the ice each year. Current environmental regulations require the speedy recovery of the vehicle or structure in this situation. Divers must be hired, and when the trouble occurs far from shore, helicopters may be employed for hoisting.

Other risks associated with ice fishing include carbon monoxide poisoning from fish house heaters and frostbite due to prolonged exposure to wind and low temperatures, although most new houses are fitted with air exchange systems that allow air flow, preventing poisoning.

Although fatalities are somewhat rare, in the year of 2017, 56 people died while out on the ice in USA and Canada. Fatalities almost always occur from drowning after one has fallen into the ice, although a small number of victims died from blunt-force trauma (&quot;e.g.:&quot; hitting one&#x27;s head on the ice whilst falling in the water).

==Contests==

Anywhere there is fishing, there are contests, and ice fishing is no exception. Ice fishing contests generally offer prizes for the largest number of fish caught within a limited time period. There are many ice fishing contests consisting of friends and neighbors with a modest number of contestants and small prizes. Conversely, throughout North America—especially in the northern parts of the Midwest and throughout Canada—many large and well-organized contests take place yearly. Most of these larger contests offer big prizes for contestants who catch the biggest fish.

Currently, the world&#x27;s largest contest, the Brainerd Jaycees Ice Fishing Extravaganza, is held on Gull Lake, north of Brainerd, Minnesota, in January of each year. The contest has over 15,000 anglers and drills over 20,000 holes for the contest. $152,232 in charity was raised in the 2016 contest, and donated to 41 local charities.

Lake Simcoe in Canada has abundant cold water fish such as lake trout, herring and whitefish. It is sometimes known as Canada&#x27;s ice fishing capital, and every year it is host to a very large and well-organized contest.

In Hwacheon, South Korea, a large ice fishing festival is held every January. The Ice Festival draws nearly a million visitors every year, and thousands of people have taken part in a contest to catch fish in a frozen Hwacheoncheon (a tributary of the Han River).

== Bycatch ==

=== Non-fish ===

In North America, common mudpuppies (&quot;Necturus maculosus)&quot; are frequently caught accidentally while ice fishing. Mudpuppies are large (10–17 in) fully aquatic salamanders that are active during the winter. They breathe using feathery gills that they retain from their larval stage. They forage for aquatic invertebrates and small fish. There is a myth that mudpuppies left out on the ice will survive the winter and return to the water when it thaws. However, as mudpuppies cannot survive freezing and require water to breath, it is likely that this practice has led to the death of many mudpuppies.

<text>John Richard Jefferies (6 November 1848 – 14 August 1887) was an English nature writer, noted for his depiction of English rural life in essays, books of natural history, and novels. His childhood on a small Wiltshire farm had a great influence on him and provides the background to all his major works of fiction.

Jefferies&#x27;s corpus of writings covers a range of genres and topics, including &quot;Bevis&quot; (1882), a classic children&#x27;s book, and &quot;After London&quot; (1885), a work of science fiction. For much of his adult life he suffered from tuberculosis, and his struggles with the illness and with poverty also play a role in his writing. Jefferies valued and cultivated an intensity of feeling in his experience of the world around him, a cultivation that he describes in detail in &quot;The Story of My Heart&quot; (1883). This work, an introspective depiction of his thoughts and feelings about the world, gained him the reputation of a nature mystic at the time, but it is his success in conveying his awareness of nature and people within it, both in his fiction and in essay collections such as &quot;The Amateur Poacher&quot; (1879) and &quot;Round About a Great Estate&quot; (1880), that has drawn most admirers. Walter Besant wrote of his reaction on first reading Jefferies: &quot;Why, we must have been blind all our lives; here were the most wonderful things possible going on under our very noses, but we saw them not.&quot;

==Life and works==

===Early life===

John Richard Jefferies (he used the first name only during his childhood) was born at Coate in the parish of Chiseldon, near Swindon, Wiltshire, the son of a farmer, James Luckett Jefferies (1816–1896). His birthplace and home is now a museum open to the public. James Jefferies had the farm from his father, John Jefferies, who had been a printer in London before returning to Swindon to run the family mill and bakery. Richard&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Gyde (1817–1895), always called Betsy, was the daughter of John Jefferies&#x27;s binder and manager.

These relationships are mirrored in the characters of Jefferies&#x27;s late novel &quot;Amaryllis at the Fair&quot; (1887); and the portraits of the family in the novel tally with external accounts of the Jefferies. James Jefferies, like Iden in &quot;Amaryllis&quot;, was devoted to his garden, while struggling to make a financial success of the farm. The garden, lovingly recalled in &quot;Wood Magic&quot; and &quot;Amaryllis&quot;, also made a strong impression on the memories of those who knew the Jefferies at the time. Betsy, like Iden&#x27;s wife, seems to have been dissatisfied with life on the farm: &quot;a town-bred woman with a beautiful face and a pleasure-loving soul, kind and generous to a fault, but unsuited to a country life.&quot; The farm was very small, with of pasture; and a mortgage of £1500 would later begin a slide into debt for James Jefferies, who lost the farm in 1877 and became a jobbing gardener. But these difficulties were less evident in Richard&#x27;s childhood. The situation was much as in &quot;After London&quot; (1885), where the farming and gardening Baron is again based on James Jefferies: &quot;The whole place was thus falling to decay, while at the same time it seemed to be flowing with milk and honey&quot;. One part of the Jefferies family is strikingly missing from the books. In &quot;Wood Magic&quot;, &quot;Bevis&quot; and &quot;Amaryllis&quot;, the hero (or heroine) has no siblings; only &quot;After London&quot; gives the main character brothers and depicts the imperfect sympathy between them. James and Elizabeth&#x27;s first child, Ellen, had died young; but Richard had two younger brothers and a younger sister.

Jefferies spent several of his earlier years, between the ages of four and nine, with his aunt and uncle, the Harrilds, in Sydenham, where he attended a private school, returning to Coate in the holidays. His uncle, Thomas Harrild, was a son of the printing innovator Robert Harrild. Jefferies kept a close friendship with Mrs. Ellen Harrild (nee Gyde) and his letters to her are an important source for biographers. At Coate, he spent most of his time in the countryside; and much of what he narrates of Bevis is true of himself. His father had taken him shooting when he was eight; and already at nine he had shot a rabbit. He was soon spending much of his time shooting, snaring rabbits, and fishing. He also, like Bevis, added home-made rigging to a boat to sail on the reservoir; and he is said to have built his own canoe, like the hero of &quot;After London&quot;. At the same time, he became a keen reader: favourite books included Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques&quot;, &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;, which served as a model for mock battles fought on a field between the farm and the reservoir.

In November 1864, at the age of sixteen, he and a cousin, James Cox, ran off to France, intending to walk to Russia. (Cox, slightly older than Jefferies, worked for the Great Western Railway and had a little money saved.) After crossing the channel, they soon found that their schoolboy French was insufficient and returned to England. Before they reached Swindon, they noticed an advertisement for cheap crossings from Liverpool to America and set off in this new direction. The tickets however, did not include the cost of food; and the boys were forced to return to Swindon after an attempt to pawn their watches had drawn the attention of the police.

Jefferies left school at fifteen and at first continued his habits of solitary wanderings about the local countryside. He dressed carelessly and allowed his hair to grow down to his collar. This, with his &quot;bent form and long, rapid stride made him an object of wonder in the town of Swindon. But he was perfectly unconscious of this, or indifferent to it.&quot; He helped little on the farm (his only enthusiasm was for chopping and splitting wood) and was regarded as something of an idler. The gun that he always carried drew the suspicion of local landowners – one said, &quot;That young Jefferies is not the sort of fellow you want hanging about in your covers&quot;. Finally, early in 1866, he started work as a newspaper reporter for the &quot;North Wiltshire Herald&quot;. For several years he worked as a reporter, contributing not only to the &quot;North Wiltshire Herald&quot;, but also to the &quot;Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard&quot; and to the &quot;Swindon Advertiser&quot;. The editor of the &quot;Swindon Advertiser&quot;, William Morris, an antiquarian and local historian, lent Jefferies books and encouraged his early writing attempts. Jefferies himself developed an antiquarian interest in the countryside: he published articles on local history in the &quot;North Wiltshire Herald&quot; and was the first to notice a stone circle near Coate Farm. He was also spending much time on the downs, particularly at the iron age hill fort, Liddington Castle, where he would lie on the grass, ecstatically feeling and seeking a connection with the natural world. In September 1867 and July 1868 he was very ill. In retrospect the illnesses were clearly the first symptoms of the tuberculosis that would kill him. He emerged from them weakened and very thin – &quot;My legs are as thin as a grasshopper&#x27;s&quot;, he wrote to his aunt. Illness also prompted some reconsideration of his own character: he was going to be &quot;not swell but stylish&quot; in future, since people set so much store by appearance.

He was now actively pursuing a career as a writer, writing a history of the Goddards, a local family, and &quot;Reporting, Editing, and Authorship: Practical Hints for Beginners in Literature&quot; (1873), in which he shared the fruits of his brief experience as a local reporter. Meanwhile the novels he was writing could not find a publisher. What national attention he attracted was instead from a series of letters to &quot;The Times&quot; on the Wiltshire agricultural labourer, published in November 1872. The letters, like his other writings from this period, reflect the Conservative outlook of his upbringing.

In 1874, the year of his first published novel, &quot;The Scarlet Shawl&quot;, he married Jessie Baden (1853–1926), the daughter of a nearby farmer. After living for a few months at Coate Farm, the couple moved to a house in Swindon in 1875 (its current address is 93 Victoria Road); and their first child, Richard Harold Jefferies, was born there on 3 May.

===First successes===

====Essays====

While in Swindon, Jefferies found it difficult to seek publication or employment with London publishers; and early in 1877, with Jessie and their baby son Harold, he moved to a house at what is now 296 Ewell Road, Tolworth, near Surbiton. (There is a wooden plaque commemorating this by the entrance to Surbiton Library.) The area was then at the limits of London&#x27;s growth. Jefferies spent much time wandering through the nearby countryside; and these walks would later provide the material for &quot;Nature Near London&quot; (1883).
The Surbiton years were momentous. The couple&#x27;s next child, a daughter called Jessie after her mother (but known by her second name, Phyllis), was born (on 6 December 1880), and Jefferies began to make his name at last. His new surroundings defined him, both to himself and others, as a country writer. Articles drawing on Jefferies&#x27;s Wiltshire experiences found a ready market in &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;. First came a series of essays based on his friendship with the keeper of the Burderop estate, near Coate, &quot;The Gamekeeper at Home&quot;, collected as a book in 1878. The book was well received and Jefferies was compared with the great English nature writer, Gilbert White. Three more collections followed the same pattern of publication in &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; and then in book form: &quot;Wild Life in a Southern County&quot; and &quot;The Amateur Poacher&quot; (both 1879), and &quot;Round About a Great Estate&quot; (1880). Another collection, &quot;Hodge and his Masters&quot; (1880), brought together articles first published in the &quot;Standard&quot;. In the few years that Jefferies took to write these essays, his literary skill developed rapidly: &quot;The Amateur Poacher&quot; in particular is regarded as a major advance on the earlier works, the first in which he approaches the autobiographical subject matter that is behind his best works. A minor novel, &quot;Greene Ferne Farm&quot; (1880), was the first to gain recognition, both from contemporaries and in later scholarship.

====The Bevis books====

Two books of these years form a sequence. &quot;Wood Magic: A Fable&quot; (1881) introduces his child-hero, Bevis, a small child on a farm near a small lake, called the &quot;Longpond&quot;, clearly Coate Farm and Coate Reservoir. Bevis&#x27;s exploration of the garden and neighbouring fields brings him into contact with the country&#x27;s birds and animals, who can speak to him, as can even inanimate parts of nature, such as the stream and the wind. Part of the book is a depiction of a small child&#x27;s interaction with the natural world, but much is a cynical animal fable of a revolt against the magpie Kapchack, the local tyrant. In &quot;Bevis&quot; (1882), the boy is older, and the fantasy element, by which animals can talk, is quite absent. Rather, we have realistically related adventures of Bevis and his friend Mark, fighting a mock battle with other local children, rigging a boat and sailing to an island on the lake (which they call &quot;The New Sea&quot;), fishing and even shooting with a homemade gun.

===Illness and death===

====Onset====

In December 1881, Jefferies began to suffer from his until then undiagnosed tuberculosis, with an anal fistula. After a series of painful operations, he moved to West Brighton to convalesce. About this time he wrote his extraordinary autobiography, &quot;The Story of My Heart&quot; (1883). He had been planning this work for seventeen years and, in his words, it was &quot;absolutely and unflinchingly true&quot;. It was not an autobiography of the events of his life, but an outpouring of his deepest thoughts and feelings.

Articles about the Surbiton area were reprinted in the popular &quot;Nature Near London&quot; (1883), although the last chapters of the book refer to Beachy Head, Ditchling Beacon and other Sussex landmarks.

In Brighton, his third child, Richard Oliver Launcelot Jefferies, was born on 18 July 1883. But his life was to be a short one. Jefferies moved to Eltham, then in Kent, now a part of Greenwich, in June 1884, and here, early in 1885, the child died suddenly of meningitis. Jefferies was so affected that he could not attend the funeral.

====&quot;After London&quot;====

Jefferies&#x27;s next novel, &quot;After London&quot; (1885), can be seen as an early example of &quot;post-apocalyptic fiction&quot;: after some sudden and unspecified catastrophe has depopulated England, the countryside reverts to nature, and the few survivors to a quasi-medieval way of life.

The book has two parts. The first, &quot;The Relapse into Barbarism&quot;, is the account by some later historian of the fall of civilisation and its consequences, with a loving description of nature reclaiming England: fields becoming overrun by forest, domesticated animals running wild, roads and towns becoming overgrown, the hated London reverting to lake and poisonous swampland. The second part, &quot;Wild England&quot;, is largely a straightforward adventure set many years later in the wild landscape and society (here too Jefferies was setting an example for the genre); but the opening section, despite some improbabilities, has been much admired for its rigour and compelling narrative.

Critics dissatisfied with the second part often make an exception of chapters 22–24, which go beyond recreation of a medieval world to give a disturbing and surreal description of the site of the fallen city.

Jefferies&#x27;s interest in catastrophes predates &quot;After London&quot;: two short unpublished pieces from the 1870s describe social collapse after London is paralysed by freak winter conditions. In the better achieved of these, the narrator is a future historian piecing the story together from surviving accounts. The fantasy of the second part also has a predecessor in a short work, &quot;The Rise of Maximin, Emperor of the Occident&quot;, serialised in &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot; in 1876, in this case an adventure set in a remote and imaginary past.

Although the society that Jefferies depicts after the fall of London is an unpleasant one, with oppressive petty tyrants at war with each other, and insecurity and injustice for the poor, it still served as an inspiration for William Morris&#x27;s utopian &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; (1890). In a letter of 1885, he writes of his reaction to &quot;After London&quot;: &quot;absurd hopes curled around my heart as I read it.&quot; &quot;After London&quot; also influenced M.P. Shiel&#x27;s post-apocalyptic novel, &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot;.

====Final years====

After Eltham, Jefferies lived briefly in various parts of Sussex, first at Rotherfield, then in a house on Crowborough Hill. There Jefferies completed his most ambitious and most unusual novel, &quot;Amaryllis at the Fair&quot; (1887). Closely based on his own family at Coate, it describes a farm and a family imperceptibly approaching disaster. There is little narrative development; instead significant or typical moments are presented in short scenes or even tableaux.

Illness and resulting lower productivity had impoverished Jefferies; and the editor Charles Longman suggested an application to the Royal Literary Fund. At first Jefferies resisted the suggestion, regarding aid from aristocratic patrons not involved in literary work as humiliating: &quot;Patrons of literature! was there ever such a disgrace in the nineteenth century? Patrons of literature! The thing is simply abominable!&quot; Longman finally succeeded in convincing Jefferies that the fund was &quot;assisted by everybody who had made any success in literature&quot;. An application was accepted and the committee voted a grant of one hundred pounds. Another fund arranged by Longman enabled Jefferies to move nearer to the sea, at Goring, a suburb of Worthing. There, on 14 August 1887, he died of tuberculosis and exhaustion. He is buried in Broadwater and Worthing Cemetery in Worthing.

After his death a number of posthumous collections were made of his writings previously published in newspapers and magazines, beginning with &quot;Field and Hedgerow&quot; (1889), edited by his widow. New collections have appeared since then, but even now not all his writings have been gathered and reprinted.

==Influence and reputation==

Early works included three by Henry Stephens Salt:
* &quot;Richard Jefferies: A Study&quot; (1894)
* &quot;Richard Jefferies: His Life and His Ideas&quot; (1905)
* &quot;The Faith of Richard Jefferies&quot; (1906)

J. S. Fletcher wrote several novels about English rural life modelled on Jefferies&#x27; work, beginning with &quot;The Wonderful Wapentake&quot; (1894).

Jefferies&#x27;s works inspired Henry Williamson to take up writing; Williamson edited a collection of Jefferies&#x27;s writings with a title that indicates the great regard that he held for Jefferies:
* &quot;Richard Jefferies : Selections of his Work with details of his Life and Circumstances, his Death and Immortality&quot; (1947)

Other writers who admired Jefferies included David Garnett, Edward Thomas (who wrote his biography), Leslie Paul, Ethel Mannin, John Fowles, Henry Miller, Raymond Williams, Jeff VanderMeer and Ludovic Kennedy.

The Canadian poet John Newlove published &quot;Inscription to Richard Jefferies on a Sarsen at Barbury&quot; in &quot;The Tasmanian Devil &amp; Other Poems&quot;.

The Richard Jefferies Bird Sanctuary in Surbiton commemorates him.

The BBC TV series Antiques Road Trip featured the Richard Jefferies Museum in 2022 when antiques expert James Braxton met with the museum&#x27;s director Mike Pringle to tell the authors story.

Jefferies&#x27; novel &quot;After London&quot; was a source of inspiration for the band Bird in the Belly&#x27;s 2022 concept album &quot;After the City&quot;. The band adapted extracts from the novel, together with broadside ballads, plague poetry and Lancashire Cotton Famine poetry to create a back story to the events that Jefferies details in his novel.

The Richard Jefferies Society awards an annual Richard Jefferies Award for nature writing.

== Works ==

The following list is necessarily selective. Much of Jefferies&#x27;s writing was not published in book form in his lifetime. Many works surviving in manuscript or only published in journals have been published piecemeal by various editors since his death. Since his contributions to journals were generally anonymous, identification is often a problem. For a fuller survey, see Miller and Matthews (1993).

<text>Snowmobile skipping, snowmobile watercross, snowmobile skimming, water skipping or puddle jumping is a sport and/or exhibition where snowmobile racers hydroplane their sleds across lakes or rivers.

==Basics==
Snowmobile watercross consists of crossing water while riding a snowmobile, which is possible because snowmobiles have wide tracks for traction and flotation in the snow. If one hits the water at an adequate speed (5 mph per 150 lb or  km/h per 100 kg of weight) and keeps the sled&#x27;s throttle open, the track keeps the snowmobile on the surface of the water without sinking. If the rider backs out of the throttle or the sled bogs or floods out, the sled will sink. A sunk sled is able to be revived by cleaning water out of the carburetor, exhaust, spark plugs, and replacing the fuel. The front of the sled is pitched upwards as riders commonly do in deep mountain powder snow.

==History==
The Grantsburg, Wisconsin first annual World Championship Snowmobile Watercross was held in July 1977 and it has been held yearly on the third week of July since. The first race was simply held to see who could make it the from the island on Memory Lake to the shore. Most didn&#x27;t, but the winner did go about . In the years following, racers became more skilled and machines more powerful. Today, racers compete in drags and ovals, with an eight-lap championship run. Over 100 racers compete in the various classes. The Classes range from the beginners&#x27; Stock Drags to the top Pro-Open Ovals Class. Competitive watercross is run by two main circuits. The IWA (International Watercross Association) operates mainly in the Midwest, while the EWA (Eastern Watercross Association) operates in the Northeastern States.

In most cases, participants in watercross strip their snowmobiles of all non-essential parts—including the seat—to save weight.

On June 25, 2013, Antti Holmberg of Finland set the record for snowmobile skipping at 180  km (112 miles). On September 18, 2015, the record is now set at 212  km (131.731 miles) by the Norwegian Morten Blien.

== Safety ==
Watercross competitions are held during the summer and the participants of official events wear life jackets and helmets, and have a buoy tethered to their sleds. If for some event the rider and sled do not complete the course, the rider releases the buoy from the snowmobile so that it floats to the surface and marks the sled for retrieval. Watercross competitions, as with other motor sports competitions, have ambulance and rescue crews nearby in the event of an accident.

While it is possible to skim over the water with a stock snowmobile, the practice can be dangerous. For example, in February 2006, a Massachusetts man died in New Hampshire after sinking into the water during a failed skimming attempt. In July 2010, a 40-year-old man died in Anaktuvuk Pass while attempting to skim across Eleanor Lake. In January 2018, a 48-year-old man died after partially skipping across Sturgeon Lake (Ontario).

The practice of &quot;skimming&quot; is illegal in the states of Minnesota and Maine. On the contrary, in Wisconsin there are places where skimming is encouraged, and some businesses rely on it to attract customers, for example at Bauer&#x27;s Dam in Conover, Wisconsin.

<text>A snowmobile, also known as a snowmachine (chiefly Alaskan), motor sled (chiefly Canadian), motor sledge, skimobile, or snow scooter, is a motorized vehicle designed for winter travel and recreation on snow.

Their engines normally drive a continuous track at the rear, while skis at the front provide directional control. The earliest snowmobiles were powered by readily available industrial four-stroke, air-cooled engines. These would quickly be replaced by lighter and more powerful two-stroke gasoline internal combustion engines and since the mid-2000s four-stroke engines had re-entered the market.

The challenges of cross-country transportation in the winter led to the invention of an all-terrain vehicle specifically designed for travel across deep snow where other vehicles foundered.

, the snowmobile market has been shared between the four large North American makers (Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP), Arctic Cat, Yamaha, and Polaris) and some specialized makers like the Quebec-based AD Boivin, manufacturer of the Snow Hawk and the European Alpina snowmobile.

The second half of the 20th century saw the rise of recreational snowmobiling, whose riders are called &quot;snowmobilers&quot;, &quot;sledders&quot;, or &quot;slednecks&quot;. Recreational riding is known as snowcross/racing, trail riding, freestyle, boondocking, ditchbanging and grass drags. In the summertime snowmobilers can drag race on grass, asphalt strips, or even across water (as in snowmobile skipping). Snowmobiles are sometimes modified to compete in long-distance off-road races.

== History ==
=== Early designs ===

A patent (554.482) for the Sled-Propeller design, without a model, was submitted on Sept. 5, 1895 by inventors William J. Culman and William B. Follis of Brule, Wisconsin.

The American Motor Sleigh was a short-lived novelty vehicle produced in Boston in 1905. Designed for travel on snow, it consisted of a sleigh body mounted on a framework that held an engine, a drive-shaft system, and runners. Although considered an interesting novelty, sales were low and production ceased in 1906.

An Aerosledge, a propeller-driven and running on skis, was built in 1909–1910 by Ukrainian inventor Igor Sikorsky of helicopter fame. Aerosanis were used by the Soviet Red Army during the Winter War and World War II. There is some dispute over whether Aerosanis count as snowmobiles because they were not propelled by tracks.

Adolphe Kégresse designed an original caterpillar tracks system, called the Kégresse track, while working for Tsar Nicholas II of Russia between 1906 and 1916. These used a flexible belt rather than interlocking metal segments and could be fitted to a conventional car or truck to turn it into a half-track, suitable for use over soft ground, including snow. Conventional front wheels and steering were used but the wheel could be fitted with skis as seen in the upper right image. He applied it to several cars in the Royal garage including Rolls-Royce cars and Packard trucks. Although this was not a snowmobile, it is an ancestor of the modern concept.

In 1911 a 24-year-old, Harold J. Kalenze (pronounced Collins), patented the Vehicle Propeller in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada.

In 1914, O. M. Erickson and Art Olsen of the P.N. Bushnell company in Aberdeen, South Dakota, built an open two-seater &quot;motor-bob&quot; out of an Indian motorcycle modified with a cowl-cover, side-by-side seating, and a set of sled-runners fore and aft. While it did not have the tracks of a true snowmobile, its appearance was otherwise similar to the modern version and is one of the earliest examples of a personal motorized snow-vehicle.

In 1915 Ray H. Muscott of Waters, Michigan, received the Canadian patent for his motor sleigh, or &quot;traineau automobile&quot;, and on June 27, 1916, he received the first United States patent for a snow-vehicle using the now recognized format of rear track(s) and front skis. Many individuals later modified Ford Model Ts with the undercarriage replaced by tracks and skis following this design. They were popular for rural mail delivery for a time. The common name for these conversion of cars and small trucks was &quot;Snowflyers&quot;.

Carl Eliason of Sayner developed the prototype of the modern snowmobile in the 1920s when he mounted a two-cylinder motorcycle engine on a long sled, steered it with skis under the front, and propelled it with single, endless track. Eliason made 40 snowmobiles, patented in 1927. Upon receiving an order for 200 from Finland, he sold his patent to the FWD Company of Clintonville. They made 300 for military use, then transferred the patent to a Canadian subsidiary.

In 1917, Virgil D. White set up to create a patent for his conversion kit that changed the Ford Model T into a &quot;snowmobile&quot;. He also copyrighted the term &quot;snowmobile&quot;. At the time, the conversion kit was expensive, costing about $395. Virgil White applied his patent in 1918 and created his own snowmobile. In 1922, his conversion kit was on the markets and available only through Ford dealerships.

The relatively dry snow conditions of the United States Midwest suited the converted Ford Model Ts and other like vehicles, but they were not suitable for humid snow areas such as southern Quebec and New England. This led Joseph-Armand Bombardier from the small town of Valcourt, Quebec, to invent a different caterpillar track system suitable for all kinds of snow conditions. Bombardier had already made some &quot;metal&quot; tracked vehicles since 1928, but his new revolutionary track traction system (a toothed wheel covered in rubber, and a rubber-and-cotton track that wraps around the back wheels) was his first major invention. He started production of the B-7, an enclosed, seven-passenger snowmobile, in 1937, and introduced the B-12, a twelve-passenger model, in 1942. The B-7 had a V-8 flathead engine from Ford Motor Company. The B-12 had a flathead in line six-cylinder engine from Chrysler industrial, and 2,817 units were produced until 1951. It was used in many applications, such as ambulances, Canada Post vehicles, winter &quot;school buses&quot;, forestry machines, and even army vehicles in World War II. Bombardier had always dreamed of a smaller version, more like the size of a motor scooter.

=== Post-war developments ===
In 1951 Fritz Riemerschmid devised what he called a snow scooter. The machine had a track mounted beneath a snowboard like base, on top of which were an enclosed engine with motorcycle like seat and fuel tank. the vehicle was steered via a steering wheel and cables linked to two small skis on outriggers either side of the vehicle.

In the mid-1950s, a United States firm built a &quot;snowmobile the arctic area of Alaska that had the drive train reversed of today&#x27;s snowmobiles with two front wheels—the larger one behind the smaller one—with tires driving an endless loop track&quot;. Little is known about this &quot;snowmobile&quot; meant to haul cargo and trade goods to isolated settlements.

An odd version of snowmobile is the Swedish &quot;Larven&quot;, made by the Lenko Company of Östersund, from the 1960s until the end of the 1980s. It was a very small and basic design, with just an engine in the rear and a track. The driver sat on it and steered using skis on his feet.

== Design ==

Most modern snowmobiles are powered by either a four- or two-stroke internal combustion engine, with the exception of the Taiga TS2. Historically, snowmobiles have always used two-stroke engines because of their reduced complexity, weight and cost, compared to a similarly powered four-stroke. However, four-stroke powered snowmobiles have been gaining popularity steadily in the last fifteen or so years, with manufacturer Yamaha producing four-stroke snowmobiles only. The Whistler Blackcomb ski resort is testing Taiga&#x27;s electric snowmobiles with lower noise, and similar vehicles exist.

Early snowmobiles used simple rubber tracks, but modern snowmobiles&#x27; tracks are usually made of a Kevlar composite construction.

Older snowmobiles could generally accommodate two people; however, most snowmobiles manufactured since the 1990s have been designed to only accommodate one person. Snowmobiles built with the ability to accommodate two people are referred to as &quot;2-up&quot; snowmobiles or &quot;touring&quot; models and make up an extremely small share of the market.

Most snowmobiles do not have any enclosures, except for a windshield.

== Performance ==

The first snowmobiles made do with as little as engines, but engine sizes and efficiency have improved drastically. In the early 1990s, the biggest engines available (typically 600cc-800cc displacement range) produced around . As of 2022, several snowmobiles are available with engines sizes up to 1,200 cc, producing 150+ hp, as well as several models with up to 1,000 cc engines producing closer to . Recently, some models are turbo-charged, resulting in dramatic increase of engine horsepower. Snowmobiles are capable of moving across steep hillsides without sliding down-slope if the rider transfers their weight towards the uphill side, a process called &quot;side-hilling&quot;.

Higher-powered modern snowmobiles can achieve speeds over . Drag racing snowmobiles can reach speeds over .

Mountain sleds permit access in remote areas with deep snow, which was nearly impossible a few decades ago. This is mainly due to alterations, enhancements, and additions of original trail model designs such as weight, weight distribution, track length, paddle depth, and power. Technology and design advances in mountain snowmobiles have improved since 2003 with Ski-Doo&#x27;s introduction of the &quot;REV&quot; framework platform. Most two-stroke mountain snowmobiles have a top engine size of 800 cc, producing around , although some 1,000 cc factory machines have been produced. These may not be as popular as many 800 cc models outperform them because of weight and an increase of unneeded power.

Cornices and other kinds of jumps are sought after for aerial maneuvers. Riders often search for non-tracked, virgin terrain and are known to &quot;trailblaze&quot; or &quot;boondock&quot; deep into remote territory where there is absolutely no visible path to follow. However, this type of trailblazing is dangerous as contact with buried rocks, logs, and frozen ground can cause extensive damage and injuries. Riders look for large open fields of fresh snow where they can carve. Some riders use extensively modified snowmobiles, customized with aftermarket accessories like handle-bar risers, handguards, custom/lightweight hoods, windshields, and seats, running board supports, studs, and numerous other modifications that increase power and maneuverability. Many of these customizations can now be purchased straight off the showroom floor on stock models.

Trail snowmobiles improved in the past 15 years as well (many of them borrowed from endeavors to produce winning mountain sleds). Heavy &quot;muscle sleds&quot; can produce speeds in excess of due to powerful engines (up to 1,200 cc stock, and custom engines exceeding 1,200 cc), short tracks, and good traction on groomed trails. Sno-cross oriented snowmobiles often have an engine size cap of 440 or 600 cc, but lighter machines with redesigned stances, formats, and weight control have produced extremely fast and quickly accelerating race sleds.

== Brands ==


According to the research center RISE, approximately 135,000 snowmobiles will be sold worldwide yearly.

Snowmobiles are widely used in arctic territories for travel. However, the tiny Arctic population means a correspondingly small market. Most snowmobiles are sold for recreational purposes in places where snow cover is stable during winter. The number of snowmobiles in Europe and other parts of the world is low.

Snowmobiles designed to perform various work tasks have been available for many years with dual tracks from such manufacturers as Aktiv (Sweden), who made the Grizzly, Ockelbo (Sweden), who made the 8000, and Bombardier who made the Alpine and later the Alpine II. Currently, there are two manufacturers of dual-track snowmobiles; Russia&#x27;s Buran and the Italian Alpina snowmobiles (under the name &quot;Sherpa&quot; and &quot;Superclass&quot;).

=== Polaris ===

Edgar and Allen Hetteen and David Johnson of Roseau, Minnesota, invented what we now know as the modern snowmobile in 1955–1956, but the early machines were heavy () and slow (). Their company, Hetteen Hoist &amp; Derrick Co., became Polaris Industries which introduced their first commercial model, the Polaris Sno Traveler in 1957.

=== Ski-Doo ===

In 1960, Joseph-Armand Bombardier introduced his own snowmobile using an open-cockpit one- or two-person form, similar to the 1957 Polaris Sno Traveler, and started selling it under the brand name Ski-Doo through his company Bombardier Inc. (now manufactured by Bombardier Recreational Products). Competitors copied and improved his design; in the 1970s there were over a hundred snowmobile manufacturers. From 1970 to 1973, two million machines were sold, peaking at 500,000 sold in 1971. Many of the snowmobile companies were small and the biggest manufacturers were often attempts by motorcycle makers and outboard motor makers to branch off in a new market. Most of these companies went bankrupt or were acquired by larger companies during the 1973 oil crisis and succeeding recessions. Sales rebounded to 260,000 in 1997 but gradually decreased afterward, influenced by warmer winters and the use during all four seasons of small one- or two-person ATVs.

=== Alpina ===
Alpina Snowmobiles are manufactured in Vicenza, Italy, by Alpina s.r.l., a manufacturer of various on-snow implements that had been building dual-track snowmobiles since 1995.

Alpina manufactures one basic dual-track snowmobile design. In 2002 the &quot;Sherpa&quot; was introduced and is the model name for the four-stroke machine. Prior to introducing the Sherpa, Alpina offered a two-stroke series designated the &quot;Superclass&quot;. The four-stroke Sherpa is currently the top machine in production. A new version of the Superclass has been released in 2017, with a lot of innovations and a new four-stroke engine. The &quot;Sherpa&quot; and &quot;Superclass&quot; series shared the same basic dual-track platform, twin tracks with dual skis up front. Power for the Sherpa is supplied by a 1.6L in-line four-cylinder gasoline automotive engine. The new Superclass power is provided by a 1.2L 3-cylinder four-stroke gasoline engine. The &quot;Sherpa&quot; and &quot;Superclass&quot; are designed as working snowmobiles for carrying supplies, pulling cargo sleds, pulling trail grooming implements, carrying several passengers, and negotiating deep snow. Engine and transmission combination are designed to deliver optimum power to pull or carry large loads while top-end speeds are kept below , depending on the model. The large footprint of the dual tracks and dual skis allows the &quot;Sherpa&quot; and &quot;Superclass&quot; to &quot;float&quot; on top of deep snow and not sink in and get stuck.

=== Taiga Electric ===

Taiga Motors in Montreal created the first commercially produced electric snowmobile. The Taiga TS2 can go from zero to in 3 seconds, with of instant torque. The Taiga TS2 weighs . 

== Sport ==
* The International 500 is a large racing event held annually in Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan. It is a race on a track, with the current purse being in excess of $40,000. It has been running since February 1969.
* Drag racing is common with snowmobiles year-round, with summer and fall often with grass or closed-course (asphalt or concrete) drag strips. The largest event is Hay Days in North Branch, Minnesota, on the first weekend following Labor Day.
* The World Championship Watercross or snowmobile skipping races are held in Grantsburg, Wisconsin, in July. The snowmobiles are raced on a marked course, similar to motocross courses, without the ramps and on water.
* The Snocross racing series are snowmobile races on a motocross-like course. The races are held during the winter season in Northern United States and Canada. One of the largest in New York is the Northeast SnoX Challenge in early January in Malone, New York, and run by Rock Maple Racing and sponsored by the Malone Chamber of Commerce.
* Snowmobiles are used for ice racing. The racing is held on an &quot;Ice Oval&quot; track. The World Championship Snowmobile Derby is held each winter in Eagle River, Wisconsin.
* Alaska&#x27;s &quot;Iron Dog&quot; is the longest snowmachine race in the world. It is long and runs from Big Lake to Nome to Fairbanks. The name refers to dog mushing, long popular in Alaska.
* Vintage Snowmobile Racing is the racing of vintage snowmobiles and has grown in popularity as a sporting event on the Canadian prairie and in America.
* The World Championship Hill Climb competition is held in Jackson, Wyoming, at the Snow King Mountain resort each year in March. 2019 was the 43rd year of the four-day event and drew around 10,000 in attendance.

== Variants ==

A snow bike takes a typical dirt bike and replaces the rear wheel with a single tread system similar to a snowmobile and the front wheel with a large ski. It is much smaller and nimbler than a snowmobile, and it has a tighter turning radius, which lets the rider go where many snowmobiles cannot. The first prototype of motorcycles with a rear tread date to the 1920s, with subsequent failed attempts to bring them to market. Many motorcycles made after the 1990s can be fitted with kits that transform them into snow bikes.

In 2017, Winter X Games XXI introduced the first snow bike event in the form of a SnowBikeCross race. The following year they introduced a Best Trick event.

== Accidents and safety ==

As a result of their inherent maneuverability, acceleration, and high-speed abilities, skill and physical strength are both required to operate a snowmobile.

Snowmobile injuries and fatalities are high compared to those caused by on road motor vehicle traffic. Losing control of a snowmobile could easily cause extensive damage, injury, or death. One such cause of snowmobile accidents is loss of control from a loose grip. If the rider falls off, the loss of control can easily result in the snowmobile colliding with a nearby object, such as a rock or tree. Most snowmobiles are fitted with a cord connected to a kill switch, which would stop the snowmobile if the rider falls off; however, not all riders use this device every time they operate a snowmobile.

Swerving off of the path may result in rolling the snowmobile or crashing into an obstacle. In unfamiliar areas, riders may crash into suspended barbed wire or haywire fences at high speeds. Each year a number of serious or fatal accidents are caused by these factors.

Each year, riders are killed by hitting other snowmobiles, automobiles, pedestrians, rocks, trees, or fences, or falling through thin ice. On average, 10 people a year have died in such crashes in Minnesota alone, with alcohol a contributing factor in many cases. In Saskatchewan, 16 out of 21 deaths in snowmobile collisions between 1996 and 2000 were caused by the effects of alcohol. Wrestler Lindsey Durlacher died in 2011 following surgery for a broken sternum he sustained in a snowmobile accident.

Fatal collisions with trains can also occur when a snowmobile operator engages in the illegal practice of &quot;rail riding&quot;, riding between railroad track rails over snow-covered sleepers. Inability to hear the sound of an oncoming train over the engine noise of a snowmobile makes this activity extremely dangerous. Collision with large animals such as moose and deer, which may venture onto a snowmobile trail, is another major cause of snowmobile accidents. Most often such encounters occur at night or in low-visibility conditions when the animal could not be seen in time to prevent a collision. Also even when successful, a sudden maneuver to miss hitting the animal could still result in the operator losing control of the snowmobile.

The next leading cause of injury and death is avalanches, which can result from the practice of highmarking, or driving a snowmobile as far up a hill as it can go. During the 2018–2019 season, 7 snowmobilers in the United States were killed. Avalanche safety education is critical for those accessing the backcountry.

Risks can be reduced through education, proper training, appropriate gear, attention to published avalanche warnings and avoiding drinking alcohol. In some areas of Western U.S., organizations provide avalanche training, some of which is free. It is recommended that snowmobile riders wear a helmet and a snowmobile suit.

== Legislation ==

Depending on jurisdiction, there may be penalties for driving outside permitted areas, without an approved helmet, without a driver&#x27;s license, with an unregistered snowmobile, or while under the influence of alcohol or other substances. There may also be regulations regarding noise and wildlife.

In some jurisdictions, a driver&#x27;s license is required to operate a snowmobile. A specific snowmobile driver&#x27;s license is required in, for example, Norway and Sweden. In Finland, a snowmobile driver&#x27;s license is not required if the driver already has another type of appropriate driver&#x27;s license (for example car or tractor).

== Environmental impact ==

The environmental impact of snowmobiles has been the subject of much debate. Governments have been reacting slowly to noise and air pollution, partly because of lobbying from manufacturers and snowmobilers. For instance, in 1999, the Canadian government adopted the &quot;Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999&quot;, but the set of rules governing pollution emissions for off-road vehicles was only released in January 2005. In another example of regulation, only four-stroke snowmobiles are allowed in Yellowstone National Park since a bylaw was recently passed to minimize CO2 emissions and noise. In Yellowstone, snowmobiles account for 80% of total hydrocarbon emissions and 50% of carbon monoxide emissions in the winter. This is just less than 2% and 1% respectively of the overall annual pollution within the park. Snowmobiles are only allowed to be ridden on the unplowed roads used in the summer, and riding off the roads is prohibited. This accounts for less than 1% (0.002%) of the park area.

In 2005 the US Forest Service published a Travel Management Rule for off-highway vehicles, strengthening the implementation of Executive Orders issued in the 1970s. However, these rules were not applied to snowmobiles. In 2015, following a decision in a lawsuit brought by Winter Wildlands Alliance against the Forest Service, the rules were extended to snowmobiles, referred to as an over-snow vehicle (OSV). National Forests with sufficient snow for winter recreation are now required to designate where OSVs are allowed to travel and where they are prohibited. In doing so, the Forest Service must minimize 1) damage to soil, watershed, vegetation, and other forest resources; 2) harassment of wildlife and significant disruption of wildlife habitats; and 3) conflicts between motor vehicle use and existing or proposed recreational uses of National Forest System lands or neighboring Federal lands.

=== Air ===
Most snowmobiles are still powered by two-stroke engines, although Alpina and Yamaha have been using four-strokes since 2002 and 2003, respectively. However, in the last decade several manufacturers have been successful in designing less polluting motors, and putting most of them in production. Yamaha and Arctic-Cat were the first to mass-produce four-stroke models, which are significantly less polluting than the early two-stroke machines. Alpina offers only four-stroke EFI engines equipped with a catalytic converter and dual oxygen-probe. Bombardier&#x27;s E-Tec two-stroke motors emit 85% less pollutants than previous carbureted two-strokes. Polaris has developed a fuel-injection technology called &quot;Cleanfire Injection&quot; on their two-strokes. The industry is also working on a direct-injected &quot;clean two strokes&quot; that is better in terms of NOX emissions.

Independent researchers, undergraduates and graduate students participate in contests to lessen the impact of emissions from snowmobiles. The &quot;Clean Snow Mobile Challenge&quot; is held yearly at Michigan Technological University regrouping the entries from universities from across United States and Canada. Some of the participants in recent years have been the École polytechnique de Montréal with a Quasiturbine engine and students from École de technologie supérieure of the UQAM with a less polluting two-stroke engine using E85 and direct injection.

=== Noise ===

Maximum noise restrictions have been enacted by law for both production of snowmobiles and aftermarket components. For instance, in Quebec (Canada) noise levels must be 78 decibels or less at 20 meters from a snowmobile path. As of 2009, snowmobiles produce 90% less noise than in the 1960s but there are still numerous complaints. Efforts to reduce noise focus on suppressing mechanical noise of the suspension components and tracks. Arctic Cat in 2005 introduced &quot;Silent Track technology&quot; on touring models such as the T660 Turbo, Bearcat, and some M-Series sleds. Ski-Doo has since then also used comparative &quot;silent track technology&quot; on some models.

The use of aftermarket exhaust systems (&quot;cans&quot; or &quot;silencers&quot;) is controversial. These replace the stock muffler with a less restrictive system that is usually claimed to increase power output of the engine. However, these aftermarket exhausts are often much louder than those from the factory, with only some being slightly quieter than a completely open, unbaffled system. Most, if not all, local snowmobile clubs (that maintain and groom trail systems) do not recommend them because of noise. Local and state authorities have set up checkpoints on high-traffic trails, checking for excessively loud systems and issuing citations. Typically these systems are installed on two-stroke powered machines (giving the distinctive &quot;braap&quot; sound); however, in recent years aftermarket companies have released silencers for four-stroke models as well.

== Economic impact ==
According to the International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association, snowmobilers in Canada and the United States spend over $28 billion on snowmobiling each year. This includes expenditures on equipment, clothing, accessories, snowmobiling vacations (lodging, fuel, and food), maintenance and others. Often this is the only source of income for some smaller towns, such as Bralorne, British Columbia, that rely solely on tourism during the summer and winter months. Once a booming gold mining town, Bralorne is now a very small town with a population of 60, and it is relatively inaccessible by car in the winter. The economy relies on visits from snowmobilers, who contribute to the economy by spending money on gas, food, and hotels.

== Social impact ==
Since the invention of snowmobiles, isolated communities of northern North America have always had a demand for them. However, the early snowmobiles designs were not economical or functional enough for the harsh environment of northern North America. Joseph-Armand Bombardier started producing the Ski-Doo in 1959 at the request of a priest. The priest had asked Bombardier to make an economical and reliable means of winter travel. The Ski-Doo greatly changed life in northern North America&#x27;s isolated communities, where Ski-Doo replaced sled dogs by the end of the 1960s. The Ski-Doo also greatly improved communication between isolated communities.

In northern North America, historically, isolated communities depended on dog sledding and snowshoeing as their primary method of transportation for hunting during the winter months. The Ski-Doo allowed trappers to travel greater distances faster, allowing them to expand their hunting grounds. Prospectors, mining companies, foresters, backcountry cabin owners, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Army also found snowmobiles very effective because they were the most economical method of transportation of small loads.

Joseph-Armand Bombardier&#x27;s tests of Ski-Dog proved that snowmobiling was fun, and snowmobiling became a new form of outdoor recreation. People who once sat dormant throughout winter were now given the opportunity in more outdoor activities.

<doc id="332770" wikidata="Q1163669" url="?curid=332770" title="Lila (Hinduism)">
<text>Lila ( &#x27;) orleela () can be loosely translated as &quot;divine play&quot;. The concept of lila asserts that creation, instead of being an objective for achieving any purpose, is rather an outcome of the playful nature of the divine. As the divine is perfect, it could have no want fulfilled, thereby signifying freedom, instead of necessity, behind the creation.

The concept of lila is common to both non-dualist and dualist philosophical schools of Indian philosophy, but has a markedly different significance in each. Within non-dualism, lila is a way of describing all reality, including the cosmos, as the outcome of creative play by the divine absolute (Brahman). In Vaishnavism, lila refers to the activities of God and devotee, as well as the macrocosmic actions of the manifest universe.

==Translation==
There are multiple theories about the derivation of &quot;lila&quot;. It may be derived from the Sanskrit root &quot;lal&quot;, which suggests playfulness of children or someone delicate.

According to Edwin Bryant, &quot;lila&quot; cannot be translated as &quot;sport&quot; or &quot;game,&quot; since those words suggest a motivation of competition. In contrast, &quot;lila&quot; is &quot;pure play, or spontaneous pastime,” which has no purpose other than experiencing joy.

== Appearance in texts ==
&quot;Lila&quot; first appears in the &quot;Brahmasūtra&quot; 2.1.33 as &quot;lokavat tu līlākaivalyam&quot; (However, [it is] but &quot;līlā&quot;, as [occurs] in daily experience.) This sutra responds to the objection that Brahman is not the cause of the world because causation requires motive. The reason given is that Brahman&#x27;s act of creation is &quot;lila&quot;, in the same way &quot;lila&quot; takes place in the world. Shankara, in his commentary, likens Brahman to a king whose needs have been fulfilled, but engages in recreational activity. In another comparison, he says that it is Brahman&#x27;s nature to create freely as it is our nature to inhale and exhale. Further, &quot;lila&quot; is not a necessary attribute of Brahman i.e. Brahman does not have to engage in &quot;lila&quot;.

In Vaishnavism, lila refers to the activities of God and his devotee, as well as the macrocosmic actions of the manifest universe, as seen in &quot;Srimad Bhagavatam&quot;, verse 3.26.4:sa eṣa prakṛtiḿ sūkṣmāḿ &lt;br&gt;daivīḿ guṇamayīḿ vibhuḥ &lt;br&gt;yadṛcchayaivopagatām &lt;br&gt;abhyapadyata līlayā&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;As his pastimes, that Supreme Divine Personality, the greatest of the great, accepted the subtle material energy which is invested with three material modes of nature.&quot;

==Interpretations==
Hindu denominations differ on how a human should react to awareness of lila.

In Pushtimarga worship, devotees experience the sentiments of &quot;lila&quot; through practices such as adorning the image of Krishna, singing devotional songs, and offering food.

According to a Gaudiya interpretation of the Bhagavat Purana, Krishna&#x27;s &quot;lilas&quot; on earth are a manifest counterpart to his unmanifest eternal &quot;lila&quot; in his abode.



==Other uses==
Lila also includes Raslila plays in which human actors re-enact Krishna and Rama&#x27;s divine play to remember the deities and experience their presence.

Lila is comparable to the Western theological position of Pandeism, which describes the Universe as God taking a physical form in order to experience the interplay between the elements of the Universe.

&quot;The Lila Solution&quot; is a proposed answer to the problem of evil. It suggests that God cannot be blamed for sufferings because God is simply playing without any motivation. Lipner argues that since God is not &quot;playful&quot; by nature, but effortlessly acts as such, God maintains the law of karma and rebirth even while playing.

<doc id="332773" wikidata="Q19845720" url="?curid=332773" title="List of writing systems">
<text>Writing systems are used to record human language, and may be classified according to certain common features.

The usual name of the script is given first; the name of the languages in which the script is written follows (in brackets), particularly in the case where the language name differs from the script name. Other informative or qualifying annotations for the script may also be provided.

== Proto-writing and ideographic systems ==
Ideographic scripts (in which graphemes are ideograms representing concepts or ideas rather than a specific word in a language) and pictographic scripts (in which the graphemes are iconic pictures) are not thought to be able to express all that can be communicated by language, as argued by the linguists John DeFrancis and J. Marshall Unger. Essentially, they postulate that no &quot;true&quot; writing system can be completely pictographic or ideographic; it must be able to refer directly to a language in order to have the full expressive capacity of a language. Unger disputes claims made on behalf of Blissymbols in his 2004 book &quot;Ideogram&quot;.

Although a few pictographic or ideographic scripts exist today, there is no single way to read them because there is no one-to-one correspondence between symbol and language. Hieroglyphs were commonly thought to be ideographic before they were translated, and to this day, Chinese is often erroneously said to be ideographic. In some cases of ideographic scripts, only the author of a text can read it with any certainty, and it may be said that they are &quot;interpreted&quot; rather than read. Such scripts often work best as mnemonic aids for oral texts or as outlines that will be fleshed out in speech.

There are also symbol systems used to represent things other than language:
== Logographic systems ==
In logographic writing systems, glyphs represent words or morphemes (meaningful components of words, as in &quot;mean-ing-ful&quot;) rather than phonetic elements.

No logographic script is composed solely of logograms. All contain graphemes that represent phonetic (sound-based) elements as well. These phonetic elements may be used on their own (to represent, for example, grammatical inflections or foreign words), or may serve as phonetic complements to a logogram (used to specify the sound of a logogram that might otherwise represent more than one word). In the case of Chinese, the phonetic element is built into the logogram itself; in Egyptian and Mayan, many glyphs are purely phonetic, whereas others function as either logograms or phonetic elements, depending on context. For this reason, many such scripts may be more properly referred to as logosyllabic or complex scripts; the terminology used is largely a product of custom in the field, and is to an extent arbitrary.

=== Consonant-based logographies ===
*Hieroglyphic, Hieratic, and Demotic – the writing systems of Ancient Egypt
**Egyptian hieroglyphs

=== Syllable-based logographies ===
*Anatolian hieroglyphs – Luwian
*Cuneiform – Sumerian, Akkadian, other Semitic languages, Elamite, Hittite, Luwian, Hurrian, and Urartian
*Chinese characters – Chinese, Japanese (called Kanji), Korean (called Hanja), Vietnamese (called Chữ Hán, obsolete)
**Sawndip – Zhuang
**Chữ Nôm - Vietnamese
**Khitan large script – Khitan
**Khitan small script – Khitan
**Jurchen script – Jurchen
**Tangut script – Tangut 
*Eghap (or Bagam) script
*Maya script – Chorti, Yucatec, and other Classic Maya languages
*Pau Cin Hau logographic script – Tedim
*Sui script – Sui language
*Yi (classical) – various Yi/Lolo languages

==Syllabaries==
In a syllabary, graphemes represent syllables or moras. (The 19th-century term &quot;syllabics&quot; usually referred to &quot;abugidas&quot; rather than true syllabaries.)

*Afaka Ndyuka
*Alaska or Yugtun script Central Yup&#x27;ik
*Bété
*Cherokee Cherokee
*Cypriot Arcadocypriot Greek
*Geba Naxi
*Iban or Dunging script Iban
*Kana Japanese (although primarily based on moras rather than syllables)
**Hiragana
**Katakana

=== Semi-syllabaries ===
In most of these systems, some consonant-vowel combinations are written as syllables, but others are written as consonant plus vowel. In the case of Old Persian, all vowels were written regardless, so it was &quot;effectively&quot; a true alphabet despite its syllabic component. In Japanese a similar system plays a minor role in foreign borrowings; for example, [tu] is written [to]+[u], and [ti] as [te]+[i]. Paleohispanic semi-syllabaries behaved as a syllabary for the stop consonants and as an alphabet for the rest of consonants and vowels.

The Tartessian or Southwestern script is typologically intermediate between a pure alphabet and the Paleohispanic full semi-syllabaries. Although the letter used to write a stop consonant was determined by the following vowel, as in a full semi-syllabary, the following vowel was also written, as in an alphabet. Some scholars treat Tartessian as a redundant semi-syllabary, others treat it as a redundant alphabet. Other scripts, such as Bopomofo, are semi-syllabic in a different sense: they transcribe half syllables. That is, they have letters for syllable onsets and rimes &quot;(kan = &quot;k-an&quot;)&quot; rather than for consonants and vowels &quot;(kan = &quot;k-a-n&quot;).&quot;

== Segmental systems ==
A segmental script has graphemes which represent the phonemes (basic unit of sound) of a language.

Note that there need not be (and rarely is) a one-to-one correspondence between the graphemes of the script and the phonemes of a language. A phoneme may be represented only by some combination or string of graphemes, the same phoneme may be represented by more than one distinct grapheme, the same grapheme may stand for more than one phoneme, or some combination of all of the above.

Segmental scripts may be further divided according to the types of phonemes they typically record:

=== Abjads ===
An abjad is a segmental script containing symbols for consonants only, or where vowels are &quot;optionally&quot; written with diacritics (&quot;pointing&quot;) or only written word-initially.

===Abugidas===
An abugida, or &quot;alphasyllabary&quot;, is a segmental script in which vowel sounds are denoted by diacritical marks or other systematic modification of the consonants. Generally, however, if a single letter is understood to have an inherent unwritten vowel, and only vowels other than this are written, then the system is classified as an abugida regardless of whether the vowels look like diacritics or full letters. The vast majority of abugidas are found from India to Southeast Asia and belong historically to the Brāhmī family, however the term is derived from the first characters of the abugida in Ge&#x27;ez: አ (A) ቡ (bu) ጊ (gi) ዳ (da) — (compare with &quot;alphabet&quot;). Unlike abjads, the diacritical marks and systemic modifications of the consonants are not optional.

====Final consonant-diacritic abugidas====
In at least one abugida, not only the vowel but any syllable-final consonant is written with a diacritic. That is, if representing [o] with an under-ring, and final [k] with an over-cross, [sok] would be written as .

*Róng Lepcha

====Vowel-based abugidas====
In a few abugidas, the vowels are basic, and the consonants secondary. If no consonant is written in Pahawh Hmong, it is understood to be /k/; consonants are written after the vowel they precede in speech. In Japanese Braille, the vowels but not the consonants have independent status, and it is the vowels which are modified when the consonant is &quot;y&quot; or &quot;w&quot;.

== List of writing systems by adoption ==
The following list contains writing systems that are in active use by a population of at least 50,000.
==Undeciphered and possible writing systems==
These systems have not been deciphered. In some cases, such as Meroitic, the sound values of the glyphs are known, but the texts still cannot be read because the language is not understood. Several of these systems, such as Isthmian script and Indus script, are claimed to have been deciphered, but these claims have not been confirmed by independent researchers. In many cases it is doubtful that they are actually writing. The Vinča symbols appear to be proto-writing, and quipu may have recorded only numerical information. There are doubts that the Indus script is writing, and the Phaistos Disc has so little content or context that its nature is undetermined.

*Byblos syllabary the city of Byblos
*Cretan hieroglyphs
*Indus Indus Valley civilization
*Isthmian (apparently logosyllabic)
*Linear A (a syllabary) Minoan
*Lukasa Kingdom of Luba (a memory device)
*Mixtec Mixtec (perhaps pictographic)
*Neolithic signs in China, including:
**Banpo symbols Yangshao culture (perhaps proto-writing)
**Jiahu symbols Peiligang culture (perhaps proto-writing)
**Sawveh Western Guangxi (disputed; perhaps proto-writing)
*Olmec Olmec civilization (possibly the oldest Mesoamerican script)
*Para-Lydian script Unknown language of Asia Minor; script appears related to the Lydian alphabet.
*Phaistos Disc (a unique text, very possibly not writing)
*Proto-Elamite Elam (nearly as old as Sumerian)
*Proto-Sinaitic (likely an abjad)
*Quipu Inca Empire (possibly numerical only)
*Rongorongo Rapa Nui (perhaps a syllabary)
*Sidetic Sidetic 
*Trojan script (possibly related to Linear B)
*Zapotec Zapotec (another old Mesoamerican script)

==Undeciphered manuscripts==
Comparatively recent manuscripts and other texts written in undeciphered (and often unidentified) writing systems; some of these may represent ciphers of known languages or hoaxes.

*Voynich manuscript
*Rohonc Codex
*Hamptonese
*Dorabella cipher

==Phonetic alphabets==
This section lists alphabets used to transcribe phonetic or phonemic sound; not to be confused with spelling alphabets like the ICAO spelling alphabet. Some of these are used for transcription purposes by linguists; others are pedagogical in nature or intended as general orthographic reforms.

* International Phonetic Alphabet
** X-SAMPA (and original SAMPA while not covering all of IPA), is an encoding of a phonetic alphabet, i.e. IPA, using just ASCII.
* Americanist phonetic notation
* Uralic Phonetic Alphabet

==Special alphabets==

<doc id="332794" wikidata="Q1049343" url="?curid=332794" title="Quartering Acts">
<text>The Quartering Acts were several acts of the Parliament of Great Britain which required local authorities in the Thirteen Colonies of British North America to provide British Army personnel in the colonies with housing and food. Each of the Quartering Acts was an amendment to the Mutiny Act and required annual renewal by Parliament. They were originally intended as a response to issues which arose during the French and Indian War and soon became a source of tensions between the inhabitants of the colonies and the government in London. These tensions would later lead toward the American War of Independence. These acts were the reason for the Third Amendment to the United States Constitution.

==Quartering Act 1765==
General Thomas Gage, the Commander-in-Chief, North America, and other British officers who had fought in the French and Indian War (including Major James Robertson), had found it hard to persuade colonial assemblies to pay for quartering and provisioning of regular troops on the march. Therefore, he asked Parliament to do something. Most colonies had supplied provisions during the war, but the issue was disputed in peacetime. The Province of New York was their headquarters, because the assembly had passed an Act to provide for the quartering of British regulars, but it expired on January 2, 1764, The result was the Quartering Act 1765, which went far beyond what Gage had requested. No standing army had been kept in the colonies before the French and Indian War, so the colonies asked why a standing army was needed after the French had been defeated in battle.

This first Quartering Act was given royal assent on May 15, 1765, and provided that colonial authorities would arrange for British troops to be housed in local barracks and public houses, as by the Mutiny Act 1765, but if the soldiers outnumbered the housing available, would quarter them in &quot;inns, livery stables, ale houses, victualing houses, and the houses of sellers of wine and houses of persons selling of rum, brandy, strong water, cider or metheglin&quot;, and if numbers required in &quot;&quot;uninhabited houses, outhouses, barns, or other buildings.&quot; &quot; Colonial authorities were required to pay the cost of housing and feeding these soldiers.

When 1,500 British troops arrived at New York City in 1766 the New York Provincial Assembly refused to comply with the Quartering Act and did not supply billeting for the troops. The troops had to remain on their ships. With its great impact on the city, a skirmish occurred in which one colonist was wounded following the Assembly&#x27;s refusal to provide quartering. For failure to comply with the Quartering Act, Parliament suspended the Province of New York&#x27;s governor and legislature in 1767 and 1769, but never carried it out, since the Assembly soon agreed to contribute money toward the quartering of troops; the New York Assembly allocated funds for the quartering of British troops in 1771.

The Quartering Act was circumvented in all colonies other than Pennsylvania.

This act expired on March 24, 1767.

== Quartering Act 1774 ==
The Quartering Act 1774 was known as one of the Coercive Acts in Great Britain, and as part of the Intolerable Acts in the colonies. The Quartering Act applied to all of the colonies, and sought to create a more effective method of housing British troops in America. In a previous act, the colonies had been required to provide housing for soldiers, but colonial legislatures had been uncooperative in doing so. The new Quartering Act allowed a governor to house soldiers in other buildings if suitable quarters were not provided. While many sources claim that the Quartering Act allowed troops to be billeted in occupied private homes, historian David Ammerman&#x27;s 1974 study claimed that this is a myth, and that the act only permitted troops to be quartered in unoccupied buildings.

The act expired on 24 March 1776.

== Quartering in time of war ==

During the French and Indian War, British officers frequently requisitioned private dwellings throughout the Thirteen Colonies in order to quarter their troops. Opinion in the colonies mostly opposed this due to the fact that the Mutiny Acts passed in 1723, 1754 and 1756 by the British Parliament prohibited the stationing of regular troops in private residences, something which was largely ignored by officers stationed in North America. The decision by British officers to ignore this aspect of the Mutiny Acts was viewed by some in the colonies (many of whom published their arguments in writing) to contravene the principle that the armed forces should always be subordinate to civil authority.

As a result of mounting concerns over the stationing of troops in private dwellings, the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly met and debated over proposed quartering bills that guaranteed any citizen the right to choose whether or not to allow soldiers to be quartered in their residences. The Assembly rejected several proposed bills related to the issue before passing one which ignored it altogether and only focused on how soldiers were to be quartered in public establishments. That winter&#x27;s harsh conditions led Colonel Henry Bouquet to order the colonists to quarter his troops in other places than just private homes. Bouquet felt his troops couldn&#x27;t survive the winter without better living conditions. Bouquet wrote a letter to the governor of Pennsylvania telling him to issue a warrant to allow the quartering of his troops in private homes. 

The governor issued the warrant but left it blank instead of directly listing what Bouquet could or could not do. The Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly was outraged when they learned what their governor had done. Instead of asking for a veto on the warrant, they asked for a review on how many troops could be quartered in a single home at a time. However, the only response they received was that the king&#x27;s troops must and will be quartered. In response to this the Assembly met on a Sunday for the first time. There they wrote a letter to the governor asking why he was violating the Mutiny Acts when the acts had been passed by the British Parliament.

In response to what was happening to the colonists, Benjamin Franklin opened up an Assembly meeting suggesting that soldiers could be quartered in public houses in the suburbs. This meant instead of the troops be directly in the city they would be in houses on the outskirts of the city on farms where they could potentially have more space. Governor Denny attended this Pennsylvania meeting and bluntly answered that the commander in chief, Lord Loudoun, had requested quartering for the troops in Philadelphia and if anybody had a problem with this then they should talk to him. The committeemen responding by stating publicly that they felt Denny was siding with Lord Loudoun when in their view since he was the governor, he should have worked to protect their rights instead. In Albany, New York, the mayor had allocated 1,000 pounds for the building of barracks for Loudoun&#x27;s troops, but it had not been built by the time the soldiers arrived. The mayor told Loudoun that he knew his rights and refused to let the troops be quartered in Albany. When the mayor stayed adamant on his beliefs of not allowing the soldiers to be quartered, Loudoun had them quarter themselves in private homes.

In an early August committee meeting in Boston, Massachusetts, the governor was able to get the committee to pass a bill to grant money for the building of barracks. These barracks would accommodate up to one thousand troops. The barracks were built and all that had to be done was convince Loudoun to obey the procedures set by Parliament. Everything went smoothly until two recruiting officers complained to governor Pownall of Massachusetts that they were denied quarters in Boston. The response was that it was illegal to quarter in private homes in Boston and the committeemen suggested that they stay at the newly built barracks at Castle William. The timing of this new meeting with Lord Loudoun was extremely unfortunate. He was currently suffering losses in northern New York while trying to hold off the French and Indians. When he heard of what happened with the committeemen he argued that the current military crisis made it acceptable to quarter troops in private homes.

A bill was then brought to the governor to sign that said troops could be quartered in homes but innkeepers had the right to complain to a judge if they felt too many soldiers were there. Loudoun was enraged with this and threatened to order his troops quarter themselves in private residences again. By the end of December, the Massachusetts legislature was able to get Loudoun to agree to quarter his troops at Castle William. On May 3, 1765 the British Parliament met and finally passed a Quartering Act for the American colonies. The act stated that troops could only be quartered in barracks and if there wasn&#x27;t enough space in barracks then they were to be quartered in public houses and inns. If still not enough space then the governor and council were to find vacant space, but at no time was it legal to quarter troops in private homes. During the American Revolutionary War, the New York Provincial Congress forcibly barracked Continental Army troops in private homes.

==Modern relevance==

Grievance 13 of the &quot;27 Grievances&quot; section of the United States Declaration of Independence listing the colonies&#x27; grievances against the King explicitly notes:

The Third Amendment to the United States Constitution expressly prohibited the military from peacetime quartering of troops without consent of the owner of the house. A product of their times, the relevance of the Acts and the Third Amendment has greatly declined since the era of the American Revolution, having been the subject of only one case in over 200 years, &quot;Engblom v. Carey&quot; in 1982.

The Quartering Act has been cited as one of the reasons for the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits infringing on the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Standing armies were mistrusted, and the First Congress considered quartering of troops to have been one of the tools of oppression before and during the American revolution.

<doc id="332800" wikidata="Q1612780" url="?curid=332800" title="Boston Port Act">
<text>The Boston Port Act, also called the Trade Act 1774 (14 Geo. 3. c. 19), was an act of the Parliament of Great Britain which became law on March 31, 1774, and took effect on June 1, 1774. It was one of five measures (variously called the &quot;Intolerable Acts&quot;, the &quot;Punitive Acts&quot; or the &quot;Coercive Acts&quot;) that were enacted during the spring of 1774 to punish Boston for the December 16, 1773, Boston Tea Party.

== Background ==
The act was a response to the Boston Tea Party. King George III&#x27;s speech of March 7, 1774 charged the colonists with attempting to injure British commerce and subvert the constitution. On March 18, Lord North brought in the Port Bill, which outlawed the use of the Port of Boston (by setting up a barricade/blockade) for &quot;landing and discharging, loading or shipping, of goods, wares, and merchandise&quot; until restitution was made to the King&#x27;s treasury (for customs duty lost) and to the East India Company for damages suffered. In other words, it closed Boston Port to all ships, no matter what business the ship had. It also provided that Massachusetts Colony&#x27;s seat of government should be moved to Salem and Marblehead made a port of entry. The Act was to take effect on June 1.

==Passage==
Even some of the strongest allies of America in Parliament at first approved the act as moderate and reasonable and argued that the town could end the punishment at any time by paying for the merchandise destroyed in the riot and allowing law and order to have their course. However, the Whig opposition soon collected itself, and the bill was fought in its various stages by Edmund Burke, Isaac Barré, Thomas Pownall and others. In spite of them, the act became a law on March 31, without a division in the Commons and by a unanimous vote in the Lords.

==Aftermath==
Royal Navy warships subsequently began patrols at the mouth of Boston Harbor to enforce the acts. The British Army also joined in enforcing the blockade, and Boston was filled with troops led by Commander-in-Chief Thomas Gage. Colonists protested that the Port Act penalized thousands of residents and violated their rights as subjects of George III.
As the Port of Boston was a major source of supplies for the citizens of Massachusetts, sympathetic colonies as far away as South Carolina sent relief supplies to the settlers of Massachusetts Bay. So great was the response that the Boston leaders boasted that the town would become the chief grain port of America if the act was not repealed.

June 1 was widely observed as a day of fasting and prayer, bells being tolled, flags placed at half-mast, and houses draped in mourning. That was the first step in the unification of the Thirteen Colonies since they now had a cause for which to work together.

The First Continental Congress was convened in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774 to co-ordinate a colonial response to the Port Act and the other Coercive Acts.

<doc id="332815" wikidata="Q239988" url="?curid=332815" title="Nancy Kerrigan">
<text>Nancy Ann Kerrigan (born October 13, 1969) is an American former figure skater. She won bronze medals at the 1991 World Championships and the 1992 Winter Olympics, silver medals at the 1992 World Championships and the 1994 Winter Olympics, as well as the 1993 US National Figure Skating Championship. Kerrigan was inducted into the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2004.

On January 6, 1994, an assailant used a police baton to strike Kerrigan on her landing knee; the attacker was hired by Jeff Gillooly, then-husband of her rival Tonya Harding. The attack injured Kerrigan, but she quickly recovered. Harding and Kerrigan both participated in the 1994 Winter Olympics, but after the Games, Harding was permanently banned from competitive figure skating. At the Olympics, Kerrigan won the silver medal in a controversial showdown with gold medal winner Oksana Baiul. She then started touring and performed with several ice skating troupes that included Champions on Ice and Broadway on Ice. In 2017, she was a contestant on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

== Early life ==
Kerrigan was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts, the youngest child and only daughter of welder Daniel Kerrigan (1939–2010) and homemaker Brenda Kerrigan (née Schultz, b. 1940). She is of English, Irish, and German ancestry, and has stated: &quot;There&#x27;s very little Irish in me, just my name.&quot; While her brothers Michael and Mark played hockey, she took up figure skating at age six. She did not start private lessons until age eight and won her first competition, the Boston Open, at age nine.

Kerrigan&#x27;s family was of modest means. Her father sometimes worked three jobs to fund her skating career; he also drove the Zamboni at the local rink in exchange for Nancy&#x27;s lessons. Kerrigan was coached by Theresa Martin until she was 16, then began working with Evy and Mary Scotvold after a brief period with Denise Morrissey. The Scotvolds remained her coaches through the rest of her competitive career.

== Skating career ==
Kerrigan began to reach prominence at the national level when she placed fourth at the junior level at the 1987 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. She made an early impression as a strong jumper, but was comparatively weak in compulsory figures. She made her senior debut the following season, moving up the national rankings each year: 12th in 1988, fifth in 1989 when she won the bronze medal at the 1989 Winter Universiade, and fourth in 1990. She continued to be held back by compulsory figures until they were eliminated from competitions after the 1990 season.

=== 1991–1993 competitions ===
Kerrigan&#x27;s rise at the national level continued when she placed third at the 1991 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. She qualified for the 1991 World Figure Skating Championships, where she won the bronze medal. Her medal was part of the first-ever sweep of the women&#x27;s podium by a single country at the World Championships, as her teammates Kristi Yamaguchi and Tonya Harding won gold and silver, respectively.

In the 1992 season, Kerrigan again improved on her placement at the previous year&#x27;s national championships by finishing second. She won a bronze medal (Yamaguchi took the gold) in the 1992 Winter Olympics and earned the silver medal at the 1992 World Championships.

The following season—with Yamaguchi retired from eligible competition—Kerrigan became United States champion, even though her performance was flawed. She admitted that she would have to improve her skating in time for the World Championships. She won the short program at the World Championships in Prague, but had a disastrous free skate that resulted in her tumbling to fifth in the standings. It was followed by an even worse performance at a televised pro-am event, where she fell three times, botched the landing of another jump, and appeared dazed and depressed, losing to 1988 Olympian Caryn Kadavy.

Before and after the 1992 Olympics, she had many corporate sponsorship contracts (with companies such as Campbell&#x27;s Soup, Evian, Reebok, and Seiko) and opportunities to perform professionally, which were permitted after the International Skating Union abolished the earlier strict amateur status rules that had governed eligibility for the sport. In preparation for the 1994 Winter Olympics, she curtailed these activities to focus on her training, instead. She also began working with a sports psychologist to better handle her nerves in competition.

=== 1994 assault ===

On January 6, 1994, at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Detroit, as Kerrigan was walking through a corridor at Cobo Arena immediately after a practice session, she was bludgeoned on the right lower thigh with a police baton by an assailant, who was later apprehended and identified as Shane Stant. The assault was planned by rival Tonya Harding&#x27;s ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and conspirator Shawn Eckardt (1967–2007). The conspirators&#x27; goal was to prevent Kerrigan from competing in both the National Championships and the Lillehammer 1994 Olympics.

The attack&#x27;s immediate aftermath was recorded on a TV camera and broadcast around the world. The initial footage showed the attendants helping Kerrigan as she grabbed at her knee, crying out: &quot;Why, why, why?&quot; Kerrigan was also seen being carried away by her father, Daniel. Harding won the championship, with Michelle Kwan second. Although Kerrigan&#x27;s injury forced her to withdraw from the U.S. Championships, her fellow skaters agreed that she merited one of the two spots on the Olympic team. The USFSA chose to name her to the Olympic team rather than Kwan, who was sent to Lillehammer as an alternate in the event that Harding were to be removed from the team.

Kerrigan recovered quickly from her injury and resumed her intensive training. She practiced by doing complete back-to-back, double run-throughs of her programs until she felt completely confident in her ability to compete under pressure. The fame caused by huge media coverage of the attack led to further opportunities; she was reported to have already signed endorsement contracts for $9.5 million before the Olympics began.

Harding denied any involvement in the planning of the attack, but later pleaded guilty to conspiring to hinder the prosecution. In late 2005, Kerrigan expressed objections to Shane Stant&#x27;s wishes to have the attack removed from his record so he could join the Navy SEALs, which do not recruit anyone with a felony conviction. Kerrigan stated in a letter dated November 25, 2005, that &quot;to allow Stant to have the attack removed from his record would not only be an insult to [her], but it [also] would send the message that a crime like that can ultimately be swept under the rug.&quot; Stant&#x27;s request had already been denied by a judge, saying that it is against the law to expunge an assault conviction. Stant was 34 when he tried to remove the attack from his record.

The attack was depicted in the 2017 film &quot;I, Tonya&quot;.

=== 1994 Winter Olympics ===
The women&#x27;s single skating event of the 1994 Winter Olympics in the Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre of Norway took place seven weeks after the attack, and Kerrigan skated what she considered to be the best two performances of her life in the short program and free skate. She won the silver medal, finishing second to Oksana Baiul, and ahead of Chen Lu as Tonya Harding finished in eighth place amid controversy. Harding had trouble with her equipment (the laces on her skates) and was given a reskate by the judges. Kerrigan was in first place after the short program, but lost the free skate and the gold medal to Baiul in a close and controversial 5–4 decision.

Kerrigan appeared to display dissatisfaction and disappointment with her second-place finish. While Kerrigan and Chen waited over 20 minutes for Olympic officials to find a copy of the Ukrainian national anthem, someone mistakenly told Kerrigan the delay in the presentation was because Baiul had cried off her make-up and was getting it retouched. Kerrigan, with obvious frustration, was caught on-camera saying, &quot;Oh, come on. So she&#x27;s going to get out here and cry again. What&#x27;s the difference?&quot; CBS chose to air the undiplomatic comment, marking a distinct shift in the way Kerrigan was portrayed in the media, which had been somewhat protective of her image up to that point because of the attack against her.

Kerrigan elected not to attend the closing ceremonies at the Olympics. Her agent claimed this was because Norwegian security had advised her to leave due to death threats that had been made against her, but this was later denied. Instead, she left Norway early to take part in a prearranged publicity parade at Walt Disney World, her $2-million sponsor.

=== 1994 Walt Disney World parade ===
Following the 1994 Winter Olympics, Kerrigan participated in a Walt Disney World parade. She was caught on microphone saying to Mickey Mouse, &quot;This is dumb. I hate it. This is the corniest thing I have ever done.&quot; She later said that her remark was taken out of context and she was not commenting on being in the parade but rather on her agent&#x27;s insistence that she wear her silver medal in the parade. She said that her parents had always taught her not to show off or brag about her accomplishments. She added that she had nothing against Disney or Mickey Mouse: &quot;Who could find fault with Mickey Mouse? He&#x27;s the greatest mouse I&#x27;ve ever known.&quot;

Commenting on the media backlash, Mike Barnicle of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said, &quot;Now the thing is over so we&#x27;ve got to kill her. That&#x27;s us [the media], not her.&quot; Either because of the bad publicity or her own inclinations, some of Kerrigan&#x27;s previously announced endorsements and television deals were dropped after the Olympics.

=== Skating results ===
=== Skating honors ===
Kerrigan was inducted into the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2004. She was also honored at Ice Theatre of New York&#x27;s annual benefit gala in 2008.

=== Skating outfits ===
Kerrigan&#x27;s Olympic skating outfits were designed by fashion designer Vera Wang. Along with Christian Lacroix&#x27;s designs for Surya Bonaly in 1992, Wang&#x27;s designs marked a new trend toward couture in figure skating. Kerrigan&#x27;s white 1992 free-skating costume resembled a wedding dress with sheer illusion sleeves and a basketweave design on the bodice. Kerrigan&#x27;s 1994 Olympic dresses were also designed by Wang. She wore another white dress trimmed with black velvet bands and sheer black sleeves for the original program and a champagne-colored dress set with 11,500 rhinestones for the free skate. Wang donated those two dresses to Kerrigan, the values of which were estimated at $9,600 and $13,000, respectively.

== Post-Olympic skating career ==
Kerrigan turned professional after the Olympics. She appeared in a few competitions such as Ice Wars, but focused her career on performing in a variety of ice shows. She has appeared in &quot;Champions on Ice&quot;, &quot;Broadway on Ice&quot;, and an ice show adaptation of the musical &quot;Footloose&quot;, among other productions.

In 2003, Kerrigan became a national spokeswoman for Fight for Sight.

=== Television, movies and video games===

In the 1994 TV movie &quot;Tonya and Nancy: The Inside Story&quot;, she was portrayed by Heather Langenkamp. Years later, Langenkamp commented: &quot;Good girls always get short shrift in this society, we want the story to be about the bad girl. I can&#x27;t imagine a more admirable character than Nancy Kerrigan and it&#x27;s too bad we don&#x27;t make movies about people like that. People consider good girls boring, unfortunately&quot;.

In 1994, Kerrigan hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, season 19 episode 15, featuring musical guest Aretha Franklin.

In &quot;Tattoo Assassins&quot;, a &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;-style arcade fighting video game developed in 1994 by Data East (the release of which was cancelled, though rare, nearly-complete prototypes are in existence), one character the player can fight as is heavily based on Kerrigan. Namely, the figure-skater &quot;Karla Keller&quot; played by Cristine Dupree. Keller&#x27;s backstory as given in the game itself has her as an Olympic hopeful but in a fictionalized version of the assault on Kerrigan, Keller&#x27;s rival and fellow figure-skater &quot;Eva Gunter&quot; (a fictional version of Tonya Harding) attacks her late at night and injures her so much that Keller is forced to pull out of the Olympics. Since then, Keller trains in martial arts so she can one day take revenge on Gunter by beating her up. In the game, Karla Keller is dressed in full figure-skater attire (even wearing ice-skates) and like all other fighters in the game, has magical tattoos on her skin that come alive when the player performs special attacks and finishing moves.

In 1995, Kerrigan had a guest appearance on &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; in the episode &quot;Wrong Side of the Track&quot; where she helps Eric Matthews discover his potential for skating in a dream sequence.

In 2004, Kerrigan sang a cover of &quot;The Best&quot; for a Tina Turner tribute album.

Kerrigan appeared in the Fox television program &quot;Skating with Celebrities&quot; (2006) and played a small part in the ice-skating comedy feature film &quot;Blades of Glory&quot; (2007) with Will Ferrell. She hosted &quot;Nancy Kerrigan&#x27;s World of Skating&quot; on the Comcast Network starting in 2005, and has done commentary work for other skating broadcasts.

During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Kerrigan served as a &quot;special correspondent&quot; for &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;.

She has written an instructional book on advanced figure-skating technique, &quot;Artistry on Ice&quot; ().

In 2014, ESPN aired &quot;The Price of Gold&quot;, a &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary about the 1994 attack. On February 23, 2014, NBC aired a documentary during the 2014 Winter Olympics on the incident called &quot;Nancy &amp; Tonya&quot;.

On July 10, 2016, Kerrigan competed against Kayla Harrison on the &quot;Battle of the Olympians&quot; episode of the television program, &quot;Flea Market Flip&quot; (S7 E2).

In November 2017, she appeared on &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot; in the Christmas special episode.

In December 2017, a fictional movie about Tonya Harding and the attack on Kerrigan, entitled &quot;I, Tonya&quot;, was released; Caitlin Carver played Kerrigan.

In January 2018, Kerrigan joined &quot;Inside Edition&quot; as their Super Bowl correspondent. She also appeared in an episode of &quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot; as herself. In 2021, she played a voice role in the animated Easter movie, &quot;Eggs&quot;. She appeared in a 2023 Maximum Effort-produced advertising campaign for LinkedIn&#x27;s business-to-business marketing. The commercial featured her promoting &quot;CRM Cereal&quot; and dancing with the fictional brand&#x27;s giant panda mascot.

=== &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; ===

Kerrigan was a contestant on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; for the 24th season, which premiered on March 20, 2017. Her partner was Artem Chigvintsev. They were eliminated in the seventh week of the competition.


==Personal life==

Kerrigan graduated from Stoneham High School and attended Emmanuel College in Boston to study business. Her mother, Brenda, is legally blind, which prompted Kerrigan to create the Nancy Kerrigan Foundation, which aims to raise awareness and support for the vision-impaired.

Kerrigan married her agent Jerry Solomon on September 9, 1995, the year after she retired from competition. The marriage was her first and his third. They have three children together: Matthew (b. 1996), Brian (b. 2005), and Nicole (b. 2008). Solomon also has a son from his second marriage. In April 2017, Kerrigan said that she had six miscarriages in eight years while attempting to have her three children. She said that the miscarriages were &quot;devastating&quot; and &quot;a strain&quot; on the marriage.

<text>The Galia melon, also known as sarda in Southeast Asia, is a type of F1 hybrid melon (&quot;Cucumis melo&quot;) originating from a cross between the green-flesh cantaloupe (Cantalupensis Group) &#x27;Ha&#x27;Ogen&#x27; and the netted-rind early melon (Chandalak Group) &#x27;Krymka&#x27; (sometimes as &#x27;Krimka&#x27;). Developed in Israel at the Ne´ve Yaar Research Center of the Agricultural Research Organisation by the melon breeder Dr. Zvi Karchi, and released in 1973, the Galia melon was named after Karchi&#x27;s daughter, whose name means &quot;God&#x27;s wave&quot; in Hebrew.

According to the trade type definition, the fruits of the Galia have the following characteristics: the average weight for a Galia melon is one kilogram. They have a rounded shape, a dense netting of rough lines on the skin, and become yellow at full maturity; they are sweet and aromatic, with a special aroma and flavor and a very high content of total soluble solids (values up to 18° are possible, although the minimum value to be considered commercially mature is 11°). Ripeness is measured not by softness at the stem, but rather by color of the skin, when it starts turning from green to yellow. Left at room temperature, Galia keeps well, but after cutting, uneaten pieces should be wrapped and refrigerated to preserve flavor.

They are not particularly difficult to grow. Galias are now grown in Algeria, Brazil, Guatemala, Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Southern US regions, Costa Rica, Panama, Honduras, Greece, Turkey, Israel, and Egypt.

<text>The Royal Institution of Great Britain (often the Royal Institution, Ri or RI) is an organisation for scientific education and research, based in the City of Westminster. It was founded in 1799 by the leading British scientists of the age, including Henry Cavendish and its first president, George Finch. Its foundational principles were diffusing the knowledge of, and facilitating the general introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, as well as enhancing the application of science to the common purposes of life (including through teaching, courses of philosophical lectures, and experiments). 
Much of the Institution&#x27;s initial funding and the initial proposal for its founding were given by the Society for Bettering the Conditions and Improving the Comforts of the Poor, under the guidance of philanthropist Sir Thomas Bernard and American-born British scientist Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford. Since its founding it has been based at 21 Albemarle Street in Mayfair. Its Royal Charter was granted in 1800.

==History==
The Royal Institution was founded as the result of a proposal by Sir Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford) for the &quot;formation by Subscription, in the Metropolis of the British Empire, of a Public Institution for diffusing the Knowledge and facilitating the general Introduction of useful Mechanical Inventions and Improvements, and for the teaching by courses of Philosophical Lectures and Experiments, the application of Science to the Common Purposes of Life&quot;.

Rumford&#x27;s proposal led to a 7 March 1799 meeting at the house of Joseph Banks, then president of the Royal Society, a similar but much older learned society. A follow-up meeting on 9 March saw the first meeting of the managers of the Institution. In June of that year, the society elected George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea as its first president, and in July it purchased the 21 Albemarle Street, Mayfair building that has served as its home ever since. Renovations began immediately on the building to provide appropriate meeting, office, and laboratory space for the Institution&#x27;s mission.

The first Professor and Public Lecturer in Experimental Philosophy, Mechanics and Chemistry was Dr Thomas Garnett, whom Rumford poached from the newly founded Andersonian Institute in Glasgow in October 1799.

The steep-sided main lecture hall that has become the building&#x27;s most publicly visible feature, as the home of its Christmas lectures, was completed in 1800, the same year that the institution received its royal charter from George III. The lecture hall was put to use immediately; the first lecture given in it was by Garnett in March 1800.

Throughout its history, the Institution has supported public engagement with science through a programme of lectures, many of which continue today. The most famous of these are the annual Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, founded by Michael Faraday in 1825.

Despite Garnett&#x27;s first lectures being a great success, his salary was frozen, he was not allowed to practise as a doctor, and Humphry Davy was appointed as his assistant, so he resigned. Humphry Davy was an even greater success, as was his assistant and successor Michael Faraday. Davy&#x27;s immediate successor was William Thomas Brande.

Thus the Institution has had an instrumental role in the advancement of science since its founding. Notable scientists who have worked there include Sir Humphry Davy (who discovered sodium and potassium), Michael Faraday, James Dewar, Sir William Henry Bragg and Sir William Lawrence Bragg (winners of the Nobel Prize for Physics for their work on x-ray diffraction), Max Perutz, John Kendrew, Antony Hewish, and George Porter.

In the 19th century, Faraday at the Royal Institution carried out much of the research which laid the groundwork for the practical exploitation of electricity. In total fifteen scientists attached to the Royal Institution have won Nobel Prizes. Ten chemical elements including sodium were discovered there; the electric generator was devised at the Institution, and much of the early work on the atomic structure of crystals was carried out within it.

The Royal Institution was founded during the age of slavery, and one of its major supporters was John Fuller, whose fortune derived from two Jamaican plantations. Fuller contributed more than £10,000 to the institution, including endowing two professorships; Michael Faraday was the first Fullerian Professor of Chemistry. In contemporary times, use of the Fullerian title has been discontinued, and the two chairs will no longer be filled.

===Nobel laureates===

# Sir John Gurdon (1933–): in 2012, he and Shinya Yamanaka were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery that mature cells can be converted to stem cells

===Chemical elements discovered or isolated===

# Potassium – Isolated from caustic potash by Humphry Davy in 1807 using electrolysis.
# Sodium – Humphry Davy first isolated sodium in 1807 from molten sodium hydroxide.
# Barium – Isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts by Humphry Davy in 1808.
# Boron – Discovered by Humphry Davy who first used electrolysis to produce a brown precipitate from a solution of borates in 1808. He produced enough of the substance to identify it as an element but pure boron was not produced until 1909.
# Calcium – Isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808 from a mixture of lime and mercuric oxide using electrolysis.
# Chlorine – Elemental chlorine was discovered in 1774 but was thought to be a compound and was called &quot;dephlogisticated muriatic acid air&quot;. Humphry Davy named it chlorine in 1810 after experimenting with it and declared it was an element.
# Magnesium – First produced and discovered in 1808 by Humphry Davy using electrolysis of a mixture of magnesia and mercury oxide.
# Strontium – Known in mineral form but isolated as an element in 1808 by Humphry Davy from a mixture of strontium chloride and mercuric acid.
# Iodine – Discovered by Bernard Courtois in 1811, he lacked the resources to investigate the substance but gave samples to various researchers. It was named by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac who thought it either a compound of oxygen or an element. A few days later Humphry Davy stated it was a new element leading to argument between the two over who identified it first.
# Argon – Discovered in 1894 by Lord Rayleigh and William Ramsay.

===Past presidents===

Since 1799, the Royal Institution has had fifteen presidents and one acting president.
*1799 – George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea
*1813 – George John Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer
*1825 – Thomas Pelham, 2nd Earl of Chichester
*1827 – Edward Adolphus Seymour, 11th Duke of Somerset
*1842 – Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland
*1865 – Sir Henry Holland, 1st Baronet
*1873 – Algernon George Percy, 6th Duke of Northumberland
*1899 – Henry George Percy, 7th Duke of Northumberland

*1976 – Prince Edward, Duke of Kent
===Past directors===
The leadership of the Royal Institution has had various titles:
* Director of the Laboratory
* Director of the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory
* Director

The position was abolished in 2010, with the firing of Susan Greenfield.

The position was restored in April 2017 with the appointment of Sarah Harper, Professor of Gerontology at the University of Oxford. Harper resigned in September 2017.

The present director is Katherine Mathieson.

===Andrade controversy===
In 1952, Edward Andrade was forced to resign following a complicated controversy over the management of the Royal Institution and his powers as director, involving a power struggle with Alexander Rankine who was secretary. Following various resignations and general meetings of members, Andrade was awarded £7,000 by arbitration: the arbitrators blamed the problems on &quot;a lack of clear definition of roles ... an outdated constitution, and the inability of the protagonists to compromise&quot;. Andrade launched a lawsuit to set the arbitration aside, which he lost.

===Director Greenfield firing===
From 1998 to 8 January 2010, the director of the Royal Institution was Baroness Susan Greenfield, but following a review, the position was abolished for being &quot;no longer affordable&quot;. The Royal Institution had found itself in a financial crisis following a £22 million development programme led by Greenfield, which included refurbishment of the institution&#x27;s main Albemarle Street building, and the addition of a restaurant and bar with an aim to turn the venue into a &quot;Groucho club for science&quot;. The project ended £3 million in debt.

Greenfield subsequently announced that she would be suing for discrimination.
The RI&#x27;s official statement stated it would &quot;continue to deliver its main charitable objectives under the direction of chief executive officer, Chris Rofe and a talented senior team including Professor Quentin Pankhurst, the Director of the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory, Dr Gail Cardew, the Head of Programmes and Professor Frank James, Head of Collections and Heritage.&quot; Baroness Greenfield later dropped the discrimination case.

==Current organisation==

Today the Royal Institution is committed to &quot;diffusing science for the common purposes of life&quot;. Membership is open to all, with no nomination procedure or academic requirements, on payment of an annual subscription.

The Institution&#x27;s patrons and trustees include:
* Patron: Charles III
* President: The Duke of Kent
* Honorary Vice-President: Sir John Ritblat
* Chairman: Sir Richard Catlow
* Board of Trustees (current): Sophie Forgan, Simon Godwin, Kate Hamilton, Suze Kundu, Renato Lulia, the Baroness Morris of Yardley, Vincent Nobel, Christopher Potter, Angela Seddon, Jack Stilgoe, Harriet Wallace, Allison Wollard

In December 2021, the Institution appointed Katherine Mathieson as Director. In July 2018, the institution announced a new five-year strategy running from October 2018 to September 2023. The strategy, which sets out to double the charity&#x27;s size, involves &quot;plans for new research, development of a new national science club and open forum public policy debates&quot;. One new venture will be a Research Centre for Science and Culture, working with other academic groups, this &quot;will investigate historical and contemporary examples of the relationship between science and culture&quot;.

The institution&#x27;s palatial home has been greatly enlarged and redeveloped since 1799, and is a Grade I listed building. The structure&#x27;s last refurbishment was a £22 million project completed in 2008, intended to create a &quot;science salon&quot; for the public. As well as the famous Lecture Theatre, the building contains several function rooms, modern research facilities and a public café. The trustees were considering selling the building in an effort to recoup the organisation&#x27;s debts, which amounted to £7 million. In 2013 The Ri received an anonymous donation of £4.4m and as of January 2016, the Ri is now debt-free.
The institution (which it now abbreviates as &#x27;Ri&#x27;, though third parties often prefer &#x27;RI&#x27;) has a substantial public science programme and science for schools programme, holding over one hundred events per year on a wide variety of topics. The Christmas Lectures continue today as a series of three televised lectures aimed at children. The Friday Evening Discourses are monthly lectures given by eminent scientists, each limited to exactly one hour, a tradition started by Faraday. There is an annual members&#x27; ballot for tickets to the Christmas Lectures but all other events are open to the public. Discounts or free tickets are available to Ri Patrons and Members. Many other events and lectures are held both at Albemarle Street and at other venues around the country.

Scientific research headed by Professor Quentin Pankhurst continues to be done under the auspices of the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory (DFRL), and indeed this is considered to be one of the UK&#x27;s most notable labs in nano-science.

In May 2015, The Royal Institution was host to the historic unveiling of the Santara Computer, created by Dr Andrew Deonarine.

In November 2015 a new membership scheme was launched and Fellows of the Ri were abolished. The new scheme includes the categories Member, Under 26 and Ri Young Member. Adult Members have voting rights and use of MRi as post-nominal letters. A Patrons&#x27; scheme has also been introduced for the first time.

In December 2011 the Royal Institution launched the Ri Channel, a new website displaying science videos and archive content from the Royal Institution, including past Christmas Lectures. The Ri Channel was archived in late 2017 with all Ri videos except past Christmas Lectures being hosted on YouTube. Past Christmas Lectures are hosted on the Ri&#x27;s website and in early 2018 the Ri began a to upload all past Christmas Lectures that were not already available on its website.

The Royal Institution has become a mixed tenancy office building that hosts conferences, weddings and events in order to pay its bills. In 2015 it sold part of its historic collection of manuscripts to raise funds. Since 2021, the researchers of the London Institute for Mathematical Sciences have been tenants on the second floor. They occupy rooms that were once the private living quarters of Michael Faraday, where they carry out their research in theoretical physics and mathematics.

==Faraday Museum==

In 1973 the Royal Institution opened the Faraday Museum, a museum dedicated to Michael Faraday. It is in the main building in Albemarle Street and is open to the public during weekday office hours. The highlight of the exhibition is Faraday&#x27;s original 1850s laboratory (not a reconstruction as often cited). Opposite this lab is the current state-of-the-art nanotechnology lab. Other exhibits include the discoveries, people and activities of the Royal Institution.

<doc id="332829" wikidata="Q2823565" url="?curid=332829" title="Massachusetts Government Act">
<text>The Massachusetts Government Act (14 Geo. 3. c. 45) was passed by the Parliament of Great Britain, receiving royal assent on 20 May 1774. The act effectively abrogated the 1691 charter of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and gave its royally-appointed governor wide-ranging powers. The colonists declared that it altered, by parliamentary fiat, the basic structure of colonial government, and vowed to block its implementation. The act was a major step on the road to the start of the American Revolution in 1775.

==Background==
The Act is one of the &quot;Intolerable Acts&quot; (also known as &quot;Repressive Acts&quot; and &quot;Coercive Acts&quot;), which were designed to suppress dissent and restore order in Massachusetts. In the wake of the Boston Tea Party, the British Parliament launched a legislative offensive against Massachusetts to control its errant behavior. British officials believed that their inability to control Massachusetts was partly rooted in the highly-independent nature of its local government. On May 2, 1774, Lord North, speaking as the head of the ministry, called on Parliament to adopt the Act on the grounds that the whole colony was &quot;in a distempered state of disturbance and opposition to the laws of the mother country.&quot;

==Contents==
The Massachusetts Government Act abrogated the colony&#x27;s charter and provided for a greater amount of royal control. Massachusetts had been unique among the colonies in its ability to elect members of its executive council. The act took away that right and instead gave the king the sole power to appoint and dismiss the council. Additionally, many civil offices that had been chosen by election were now to be appointed by the royal governor. Town meetings were forbidden without consent of the governor. As Lord North explained to Parliament, the purpose of the act was &quot;to take the executive power from the hands of the democratic part of government.&quot;

==Governor==
Power was centralized in the hands of the royal governor, and historic rights to self-government were abrogated. The Act provided that local officials were no longer to be elected:
: [The] governor, to nominate and appoint... and also to remove, without the consent of the council, all judges of the inferior courts of common pleas, commissioners of Oyer and Terminer, the attorney general, provosts, marshals, justices of the peace, and other officers... and nominate and appoint the sheriffs without the consent of the council.

Most important was the provision regarding town meetings, the key instrument of local rule:
: whereas a great abuse has been made of the power of calling such meetings, and the inhabitants have, contrary to the design of their institution, been misled to treat upon matters of the most general concern, and to pass many dangerous and unwarrantable resolves: for remedy whereof, be it enacted... no meeting shall be called... without the leave of the governor, [apart from one annual election meeting].

==Implementation==
When Governor Thomas Gage invoked the act in October 1774 to dissolve the provincial assembly, its Patriot leaders responded by setting up an alternative government that actually controlled everything outside Boston. They argued that the new act had nullified the contract between the king and the people, who ignored Gage&#x27;s order for new elections and set up the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. It acted as the province&#x27;s (from 1776 the state&#x27;s) government until the 1780 adoption of the Massachusetts State Constitution. The governor had control only in Boston, where his soldiers were based.

Parliament repealed the act in 1778 as part of attempts to reach a diplomatic end to the ongoing American Revolutionary War.

<text>The Administration of Justice Act, or &quot;An Act for the Impartial Administration of Justice&quot;, also popularly called the Monkey Act and the Murder Act by George Washington, was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain (14 Geo. 3 c. 39). It covered the treatment of British officials in the Massachusetts Bay colony and became law on 20 May 1774.

It was one of several acts (known as the Intolerable Acts) passed by the British government in an effort to keep control of the American colonies. 

==History==
By the early 1770s, many citizens living in the British colonies in America were organizing for independence from the British government. 

The Act was created in the aftermath of the Boston Tea Party, when the British government was working to regain control of the colony. 

The law was one of the measures (commonly referred to as the Intolerable Acts, the Punitive Acts, or the Coercive Acts by many colonists) that was designed to secure Britain&#x27;s jurisdiction over the American dominions. As such, it is a part of the Grievances of the United States Declaration of Independence.

The Act was seen by those in America as a final sign that there would be no further negotiations with the British government in London. The First Continental Congress met four months later and the American Revolutionary War began less than a year after the Act was passed.

==Outline==

The Coercive Acts included the Boston Port Act, the Massachusetts Government Act, and the Quebec Act. 

The Administration of Justice Act allowed the royally appointed governor to remove any acquisition placed on a royal official by a member of the public, if the governor did not believe the official would have a fair trial. The Act was referred to as the &quot;Murder Act&quot;, as the American separatists believed that the official could get away with capital offences.

To ensure that legal trials were more favorable to the Crown than the potential prejudices of local juries, the Act granted a change of venue to another British colony (or to Great Britain) in trials of officials charged with a crime arising from their enforcement of the law or suppression of riots. Witnesses for both sides were also required to attend the trial and were to be compensated for their expenses.

==Expiry and repeal==
Section 8 said the Act would remain in force for 3 years. The whole Act was repealed as expired in 1871.

<text>Amos Alonzo Stagg (August 16, 1862 – March 17, 1965) was an American athlete and college coach in multiple sports, primarily American football. He served as the head football coach at the International YMCA Training School (now called Springfield College) (1890–1891), the University of Chicago (1892–1932), and the College of the Pacific (1933–1946), compiling a career college football record of . His undefeated Chicago Maroons teams of 1905 and 1913 were recognized as national champions. He was also the head basketball coach for one season at Chicago (1920–1921), and the Maroons&#x27; head baseball coach for twenty seasons (1893–1905, 1907–1913).

At Chicago, Stagg also instituted an annual prep basketball tournament and track meet. Both drew the top high school teams and athletes from around the United States.

Stagg played football as an end at Yale University and was selected to the first All-America Team in 1889. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach in the charter class of 1951 and was the only individual honored in both roles until the 1990s. Influential in other sports, Stagg developed basketball as a five-player sport. This five-man concept allowed his 10 (later 11) man football team the ability to compete with each other and to stay in shape over the winter. Stagg was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in its first group of inductees in 1959, and was elected Fellow #71 in the National Academy of Kinesiology (formerly American Academy of Physical Education) in 1946.

Stagg also forged a bond between sports and religious faith early in his career that remained important to him for the rest of his life.

==Early years==
Stagg was born in a poor Irish neighborhood of West Orange, New Jersey, and attended Phillips Exeter Academy.

===Yale===

Stagg entered Yale University in 1884 and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1888. He spent two additional years at Yale studying in the Divinity School under William Rainey Harper before deciding he could have more influence on young men through coaching than through the pulpit. He was very active in the Yale YMCA where he served as general secretary during his last two years.

====Baseball====
Stagg was a pitcher at Yale; he declined the offers to play for six different professional baseball teams. He nonetheless influenced the game through his invention of the batting cage.

====Football====
Stagg played on the 1888 team, and was an end on the first All-America Team in 1889.

===Springfield===
Stagg later gave up his desire for the ministry and decided to become a coach and athletic director. He spent two years at the International YMCA Training School, now known as Springfield College, from 1890 to 1892.

====Basketball====
Basketball had been invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a teacher at the YMCA School in Springfield. On March 11, 1892, Stagg, still an instructor at the YMCA School, played in the first public game of basketball. A crowd of 200 watched as the student team defeated the faculty, 5–1. Stagg scored the only basket for the losing side. He popularized the five-player lineup on basketball teams.

==Coaching career==

Stagg became the first paid football coach at Williston Seminary, a secondary school, in 1890. This was also Stagg&#x27;s first time receiving pay to coach football. He coached there one day a week while also coaching full-time at the International YMCA Training School. Stagg then coached at the University of Chicago from 1892 to 1932. He was the head football coach and director of the Department of Physical Culture. Eventually, university president Robert Maynard Hutchins forced out the 70-year-old Stagg, feeling that he was too old to continue coaching.

At age 70, Stagg moved on to the College of the Pacific in Stockton, California, where he led the Tigers for 14 seasons, from 1933 through 1946, then was asked to resign. One of his players at Pacific in 1945-46 was Hall of Fame coach of Navy and Temple Wayne Hardin.

In the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Stagg served as a coach with the U.S. Olympic Track and Field team. He played himself in the movie &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot;, released in 1940. From 1947 to 1952 he served as co-coach with his son, Amos Jr., at Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania. Stagg&#x27;s final job was as kicking coach at the local junior college in Stockton, California, which was then known as Stockton College. &quot;The Grand Old Man of Football&quot; retired from Stockton College at the age of 96 and died in Stockton six years later.

===Vegetarianism===

Stagg was reportedly an activist for vegetarianism and banned his players from using alcohol and tobacco. In 1907, he trained his Chicago football team on a strict vegetarian diet. This was widely reported in newspapers and vegetarian literature.
Stagg had spent time at the vegetarian Battle Creek Sanitarium in 1907 and was inspired by John Harvey Kellogg&#x27;s vegetarian diet. Although Stagg was cited in vegetarian literature as advocating a strict vegetarian diet throughout his life, in his memoir he stated that he was a vegetarian for only two years and did it in an attempt to relieve his chronic sciatic pain. Stagg did not consume alcohol, coffee, or cigarettes and promoted the consumption of vegetables over red meat.

==Family==

Stagg was married to the former Stella Robertson on September 10, 1894. The couple had three children: two sons, Amos Jr. and Paul, and a daughter, Ruth. Both sons played for the elder Stagg as quarterbacks at the University of Chicago and each later coached college football. In 1952, Barbara Stagg, Amos&#x27; granddaughter, started coaching the high school girls&#x27; basketball team for Northern Lehigh High School in Slatington, Pennsylvania.

==Legacy==

Two high schools in the United States, one in Palos Hills, Illinois, and the other in Stockton, California, and an elementary school in Chicago, Illinois, are named after Stagg. The NCAA Division III National Football Championship game, played in Salem, Virginia, is named the Stagg Bowl after him. The athletic stadium at Springfield College is named Stagg Field. The football field at Susquehanna University is named Amos Alonzo Stagg Field in honor of both Stagg Sr. and Jr. Stagg was also the namesake of the University of Chicago&#x27;s old Stagg Field. At University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, one of the campus streets is known as Stagg Way and Pacific Memorial Stadium, the school&#x27;s football and soccer stadium, was renamed Amos Alonzo Stagg Memorial Stadium on October 15, 1988. Phillips Exeter Academy also has a field named for him and a statue. A field in West Orange, New Jersey on Saint Cloud Avenue is also named for him. The Amos Alonzo Stagg Award is awarded annually to the &quot;individual, group, or institution whose services have been outstanding in the advancement of the best interests of football.&quot; The winner of the Big Ten Football Championship Game, started in 2011, receives the Stagg Championship Trophy, named in his honor.

At the College of William and Mary, the Amos Alonzo Stagg Society was organized during 1979–1980 by students and faculty opposed to a plan by the institution&#x27;s Board of Visitors to move William and Mary back into big-time college football several decades after a scandal there involving grade changes for football players. The Society was loosely organized but successful in combating, among other plans, a major expansion of the William and Mary football stadium.
Collections of Amos Alonzo Stagg&#x27;s papers are held at the University of Chicago Library, Special Collections Research Center and at the University of the Pacific Library, Holt Atherton Department of Special Collections. The Alonzo Stagg 50/20 Hike goes through Arlington, Virginia, Washington, DC and Maryland.

The Stagg Tree, a giant sequoia in the Alder Creek Grove and the fifth largest tree in the world, is named in honor of Amos Alonzo Stagg. Stagg is also an elected Fellow in the National Academy of Kinesiology (née the American Academy of Physical Education).

===Stagg Bowl===
The Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl, otherwise known as the NCAA Division III Football Championship Game since 1973, is competed annually as the final game of the NCAA Division III Football Tournament. The Stagg Bowl can be traced back to 1969, prior to the inception of the D-III national championship. At that time—from 1969 to 1973—the Stagg Bowl was one of two bowls competed at the College Division level—the Knute Rockne Bowl and the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl. In 1973, the NCAA instituted the D-III national championship, and the Stagg Bowl was adopted as the moniker for that game.

The first 10 Stagg Bowls were played in Phenix City, Alabama, from 1973 to 1982. Wittenberg University (Ohio) won the inaugural game via a 41–0 result over Juniata College (Pa.). The game moved to Kings Island, Ohio, for the 1983 and 1984 editions, with Augustana College (Ill.) winning the first two of its four straight NCAA titles.

The Stagg Bowl returned to Phenix City for five more years, before spending three seasons in Bradenton, Florida.

In 1993, the Stagg Bowl moved to Salem, Va., where it remained until 2017. The University of Mount Union (formerly Mount Union College) won the first of its NCAA Division III-record 13 football national championships in 1993. The Championship was held in Shenandoah, TX, in 2018 and 2019.

Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium at Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls in Canton, Ohio, was originally awarded the 2020 and 2021 Stagg Bowls; however, the 2020 Championship was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 Stagg Bowl was held at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium December 2–4, 2021.

Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland hosted the 2022 Stagg Bowl, where North Central College defeated University of Mount Union. In 2023, Salem Football Stadium in Salem, Virginia was awarded the game.

<text>Jessica Julie Anne Garlick (born 1981) is a Welsh pop singer. Garlick made her first steps into show business when she was 16. At that age, she won the Welsh final of BBC One&#x27;s talent show &quot;Star for a Night&quot;. The same year she also featured in Michael Barrymore&#x27;s &quot;My Kind of Music&quot;. She is the second-highest placed British entrant at the Eurovision Song Contest in the 21st century, coming joint third in the 2002 contest.

== Background ==
Garlick was born in Derby, Derbyshire, England. She was educated at Glan-y-Mor Comprehensive School and is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

Before appearing on Pop Idol she had been on various TV talent shows including Michael Barrymore&#x27;s &quot;My Kind of Music&quot; and &quot;Star for a Night&quot;.

== &quot;Pop Idol&quot; and the Eurovision Song Contest ==
In 2001, she was among the last ten contestants on the ITV talent show &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. The BBC later invited her to sing &quot;Come Back&quot;, one of the competing songs in &quot;A Song for Europe&quot;, the British selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2002. The audience selected her to represent the United Kingdom at the event in Tallinn, where she took her country to its best result since Imaani&#x27;s &quot;Where Are You?&quot; in 1998, finishing joint third alongside Estonia&#x27;s representative, Sahlene.

== After Eurovision ==
Later in 2002 Garlick was involved in a campaign to help children stop smoking. She made a guest appearance in the 2003 &quot;Song for Europe&quot;, during which she was charged with announcing the results of the Welsh televote, which handed top marks to the ill-fated Jemini. Later in the year, she appeared in &quot;Liquid Eurovision&quot; preview and analysis programmes.

On 16 November 2006, Garlick appeared as the hidden musician in the &#x27;Identity Parade&#x27; round on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; game show. She is now married to Owen Satterley, a personal trainer whom she has dated from her teenage years. They have a daughter called Olivia and a son called Noah.

== Later career ==
The début single from her unreleased album, &quot;Hard Not to Fall&quot;, was released on 11 May 2009, one day before the first Eurovision Song Contest semi-final. The single was only available to purchase from iTunes. She recorded a music video which was posted on her website. Garlick performed the new single, along with her Eurovision entry, &quot;Come Back&quot;, at the UK Eurovision Preview Party, at Scala, King&#x27;s Cross, on 17 April 2009.

<doc id="332843" wikidata="Q1932279" url="?curid=332843" title="New Found Glory (album)">
<text>New Found Glory is the second studio album and major label debut by the American rock band of the same name. It was produced and mixed by Neal Avron and released on September 26, 2000, through Drive-Thru and MCA Records. Featuring a new recording of the band&#x27;s breakthrough single &quot;Hit or Miss&quot;, the album was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with shipments of 500,000 units.

During the band&#x27;s American tour in late 2009, they announced a special edition re-release of the album to celebrate its tenth anniversary. The deluxe package included new liner notes, seven b-sides and a DVD. A commemorative tour also took place with the album played live in its entirety. In recent years, the album is often cited by music critics as one of the greatest pop punk albums of all time, and was officially inducted into the &quot;Rock Sound&quot; Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Background and recording==
Following the underground success of debut album &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; (1999), Drive-Thru Records founder Richard Reines had paid Eulogy Recordings $5,000 to license the album and sign the band.
Drive-Thru had initially wanted to re-release &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; along with a newly recorded version of breakthrough single &quot;Hit or Miss&quot;. Chad Gilbert said of the process, &quot;So we went into the studio with Jerry Finn and recorded it with him. I don&#x27;t like how it came out, at all. He was &quot;such&quot; a cool guy, but we were like, &#x27;nah, we don&#x27;t want to use it&#x27;&quot;. The reissue appeared in October and was promoted with a music video for &quot;Hit or Miss&quot;. Around this time, the band took a two-week break from touring and entered a studio to record the &quot;From the Screen to Your Stereo&quot; EP, which was released in March 2000.

From June 2000, the band took a six-week break from touring to record an album with producer Neal Avron. Having met him previously, the two parties discussed the desired sound the band were striving for on the record. Avron said, &quot;During pre-production, we&#x27;d get in their van for lunch and they had a poster of Britney Spears up. They wanted the music to be heavy, but the vocals to be super-pop, that was the goal&quot;. Sessions were held at Elysian Fields Studios in Boca Raton, Florida; Avron was assisted by Chad Milosevich. Avron mixed the recordings at Chapel Studios in Los Angeles, California with assistance from Dan Adams and Joe Primeau, before the album was mastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering. They re-recorded &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; again, as they felt the increase in recording budget would help the song. Avron felt that less focus on the drums was better; he would be apprehensive when Bolooki came up with a fill. As a result, most of the drum parts were &quot;kind of more laid back&quot; than what Bolooki had intended.

==Composition==
Musically, &quot;New Found Glory&quot; has been described as pop punk, comprising upbeat rhythms, buzzing guitar work, and nasally vocals, drawing comparisons to Blink-182 and the Get Up Kids. Gilbert said the group attempted to merge the rhythm of New York hardcore with elements of west coast punk. Bolooki said the title was purposely left ambiguous as it &quot;could mean anything&quot;. Guitarist and lyricist Steve Klein originally claimed that the album was about one sole girl he dated for a year-and-a-half. The lyrics tackle the topics of growing up, having relationships and moving forward in life. Discussing the writing process, Bolooki said Gilbert would typically come up with a few riffs and make the outline of a song with them. He then shares it with the rest of the band, who worked on its structure, before Klein works on vocal melodies with Pundik. It gets shared with the band again for them to add the final touches.

The opening track &quot;Better Off Dead&quot; starts with fast-paced drums and up-tempo guitar riffs, which Gilbert said was indebted to his punk and hardcore roots. It is followed by &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;, which talks about touring. &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; sees the narrator tell a story of waiting by a phone that will never ring, and references &quot;Thriller&quot; by Michael Jackson. Klein wrote it after remembering things that he didn&#x27;t like about his ex and debating whether it was right to break up with her. Discussing &quot;Sucker&quot;, Klein said it was him telling the girl that inspired &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; that none of the tracks on &quot;New Found Glory&quot; were about her. &quot;Boy Crazy&quot; talks about the typical way girls fall in love with various guys. The closing track &quot;Ballad for the Lost Romantics&quot; is a tongue-in-cheek number about the songs that couples listen to early in their relationships.

==Release==
The band played two shows of the Warped Tour; they played on a local stage and outdrew of the tour&#x27;s headlining act. On August 28, &quot;New Found Glory&quot; was announced for release the following month. The group played shows with Face to Face, Saves the Day, and Alkaline Trio between late August and early October. &quot;New Found Glory&quot; was released on September 26. In October and November, the group toured with Fenix TX, which was followed by a headlining tour with support from Midtown and Dashboard Confessional until mid-December. The band closed the year with a New Year&#x27;s Eve showed alongside Blink-182 and Weezer. In January 2001, they performed at a snowboard cross competition, a benefit for a down syndrome charity, and a WHFS radio show. &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; was released to modern rock radio stations on January 22, 2001. That same month, a music video was filmed for the song. It was shot in Los Angeles, California and featured &quot;The Real World New Orleans&quot; actress Julie Stoffer. The group invited fans through their website to attend the filming, which resulted in over 1,000 people showing up and being shut down by the Los Angeles County fire marshal. The video was posted online on February 15; it showed the band attempting to get into a venue on time.

In February and March, the group supported Less Than Jake on their US headlining tour. The &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; music video was gaining video airplay in March. In April, the group went on tour with Glassjaw, the Movielife and Autopilot Off. On April 18, the group performed &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Following this, the band went on a tour of Europe. Preceded by a performance at KROQ Weenie Roast, the band played the first seven shows on the Warped Tour until early July. They spent the following two months opening for Blink-182. The music video for &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; was posted online on July 24. In August, the band performed at Edgefest II in Canada. Due to the September 11 attacks, two shows were rescheduled for the following week. Around this time, the band members moved out from Coral Springs to San Diego, California, save for Gilbert, who moved to Los Angeles. In October and November, the band went on the Warped Inside Tour, which featured Rx Bandits, H2O and River City High as the support acts. Halfway through the trek, Bolooki broke his arm after falling off stage; Rx Bandit drummer Chris Tsagakis filled his spot. In December, the group went on a tour of the UK with support from Fenix TX.

==Tenth anniversary edition and tour==

During late 2009, the band announced they were planning a commemorative tour in early 2010 to celebrate the album&#x27;s tenth anniversary. A special edition re-release of the album was confirmed which featured seven bonus tracks and a DVD. Soon after in December 2009, AbsolutePunk officially announced the special anniversary edition of the album would be released on January 26, 2010, through Geffen Records.

The additional material includes new liner notes, demos, b-sides, &quot;The Story So Far&quot; DVD and a remix of debut single &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; by the late Jerry Finn. The re-issue also included a slightly altered version of the original cover art designed by Tim Stedman. Its collage of faded photos, including images of video games, roller skates and a Playboy, is said to encapsulate the band members&#x27; lives as teenagers (when the album was written). A full tour commencing on January 29 was also confirmed, titled &quot;The 10 Year Anniversary of the Self-Titled Record Tour&quot;, where the band would play the record in its entirety, with support from Saves the Day, Hellogoodbye and Fireworks. During the tour, the band played through the records twelve songs from start to finish, followed by an extended encore, with up to eight additional songs.

==Reception==

Upon the album&#x27;s release, it was well received by music critics. AllMusic writer Richie Unterberger awarded the album a favorable 3½ stars out of five. Despite stating the album wasn&#x27;t &quot;entirely original,&quot; he praised the record&#x27;s &quot;choppy uptempo rhythms, spiky buzzing guitars, and youthful harmonies.&quot; He also added that &quot;there were less likable young punk bands that could have been honored with a record deal in 2000&quot;. Michael Dabaie of &quot;CMJ&quot; was also favorable in his review. Comparing the band to Green Day, Face to Face and Blink-182, he stated, &quot;New Found Glory hits on a winning formula on its self-titled record: Without treading too far from the aggro path blazed years ago by bands like Dag Nasty, the quintet delivers catchy pop-punk riffs, smooth vocal harmonies and songs that are angst-ridden without being nihilistic. These guys exude sincerity, and lyrics like &quot;The needle on my record player is wearing thin/This record has been playing since the day you&#x27;ve been with him&quot; will ring true with everyone who ever wore out their Descendents records during a bad breakup.&quot; In his 8/10 review for webzine Drowned in Sound, Martin Rivers said its songs were &quot;spellbindingly catchy&quot;, making for a &quot;polished and hugely refreshing album.&quot;

British rock magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; awarded the album a maximum five K! score. Describing the release as the band&#x27;s &quot;essential purchase,&quot; they also wrote, &quot;Marking one of the biggest and quickest improvements in alternative music, the band&#x27;s major label debut hurled them to the forefront of the punk scene. Packed with infectious melodies and sing-along anthems, it would see them jostling with the likes of Blink-182 for the genre&#x27;s crown.&quot; Fellow British magazine &quot;NME&quot; awarded the album 8/10 and opined the band had &quot;spot-on vocal harmonies that add just the right amount of pop tinge to [their] relentlessly hard-charging tunes.&quot; Writing for webzine PopMatters, Andy Argyrakis was of the view that the band succeeded in writing simple, easily relatable songs that translate well in a live setting. He also added that &quot;The band&#x27;s sound runs the gamut of many of the popular punk bands of today – MXPX, Blink-182 and SR-71.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Retrospective reviews===
Arielle Castillo of the &quot;Miami New Times&quot; wrote a retrospective article on the album in 2010. She recalled how their &quot;self-titled second album catapulted the Coral Springs quartet to national stardom. Released before emo had become a dirty word, the disc boasted a boisterous but sensitive pop-punk mood that was reflected on its cover - perfectly encapsulating the record&#x27;s lyrical and sonic dance between teenage romantic naiveté and adulthood.&quot; PopMatters writer Melissa Bobbit, whilst reviewing a show on the anniversary tour, enthused &quot;what a blessing it is to still have NFG around, on this, the 10th anniversary of their self-titled record. This tour served as a collection of whimsical snapshots in their prolific career. New Found Glory&#x27;s influence is vastly felt today. A testament to that was supporting act Fireworks, whose whiplash sound and choreographed jumping all came from the pages of the NFG guidebook to punk-pop.&quot; Jason Tate, the founder and CEO of AbsolutePunk, wrote of the album, &quot;Back when New Found Glory&#x27;s &quot;Self-Titled&quot; album was released there weren&#x27;t many that gave it a chance to be one of the building-blocks for an entire genre. However, in hindsight, it appears as though that disc may have had more of an impact than anyone ever could have guessed.&quot;

Reviewing the 10th Anniversary Edition in 2010, Adam Kennedy of &quot;Rock Sound&quot; explained that the re-issue was a &quot;timely reminder of their bratty pop-punk beginnings. If heartfelt accounts of adolescent love and loss is what you&#x27;re looking for, &quot;New Found Glory&quot; is as relevant today as ten years previous.&quot; &quot;Kerrang!&quot; also issued a new article covering its tenth anniversary re-issue. George Garner wrote &quot;without them, pop-punk would be missing some of its most anthemic moments, and All Time Low wouldn&#x27;t have their name.&quot; Writing for Sputnikmusic in 2012, staff member Atari awarded the album a &quot;classic&quot; 5/5 rating. He noted how &quot;much like a thrash album, New Found Glory&#x27;s self titled album is an adrenaline fueled ride that doesn&#x27;t slow down once throughout the entire experience.&quot; He praised the record&#x27;s &quot;great sense of melody&quot;, before declaring it &quot;one of the best pop punk albums of all time.&quot;

Mark Hoppus, who later produced the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, said of &quot;New Found Glory&quot;: &quot;It was one of those records that never found its way out of my CD player. New Found Glory just had something different and unique. I was really drawn to their melodies, and their guitar parts were more interesting and more creative than a lot of the stuff that was going on.&quot; It was also explained that when Jared Logan was producing Fall Out Boy&#x27;s debut album, he asked bassist Pete Wentz about the sound the band had desired for recording. Wentz responded by &quot;handing over the first two New Found Glory records&quot;. Ben Barlow of Neck Deep has expressed admiration for the album.

===Accolades===
In November 2004, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; released a feature called &quot;666 Songs You Must Own&quot;. In the &quot;New School Punk&quot; category, lead single &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; was placed at number fourteen. Earlier in 2001, &quot;Rock Sound&quot; placed the album at number forty-five in its annual &quot;Critics&#x27; Poll of 2001&quot;, while in 2012 it was formally inducted into its official Hall of Fame. Later that year, the album again featured, this time at number 39 in the magazine&#x27;s &quot;101 Modern Classics&quot;, a list honoring the best albums between 1997 and 2012. Ben Patashnik expressed that &quot;with this album, NFG capture the best parts of summer – the girls, the sun, the house parties, the heartache, the misery – and cram all of that into 36 hook-laden minutes. Few bands have stayed truer to their roots as NFG over the years, and &quot;New Found Glory&quot; started it all.&quot; The album was included at number 2 on &quot;Rock Sound&quot;″s &quot;The 51 Most Essential Pop Punk Albums of All Time&quot; list. &quot;NME&quot; listed the album as one of &quot;20 Pop Punk Albums Which Will Make You Nostalgic&quot;. In &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; &quot;50 greatest pop-punk albums&quot; article, Suzy Exposito noted how &quot;New Found Glory&quot; &quot;is exactly what you&#x27;d expect from a bunch of baby-faced punks who kept an altar to Britney Spears in their van. Yet diva-worship aside, these guys were no Mouseketeers. An export of the South Florida hardcore scene, the group took cues from neighboring punks Discount and even metalcore band Earth Crisis to brew combustible anthems such as the splashy opener “Better Off Dead” or crushed-up morsels of rock candy like lonely tour ballad “Dressed To Kill.” Ranking the album at number six in Loudwire&#x27;s &quot;50 greatest pop-punk albums of all time&quot;, the webzine called the album &quot;pure pop-punk serotonin&quot;, before declaring that &quot;NFG became the band they were meant to be with their 2000 self-titled album.&quot; Cleveland.com ranked &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; at number 68 on their list of the top 100 pop-punk songs. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; at number 26 on their list of the best 100 singles from the 2000s.

<text>Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García (17 March 1805 – 1 July 1906), was a Spanish singer, music educator, and vocal pedagogue. He invented the first laryngoscope.

==Biography==
García was born on 17 March 1805 either in Madrid, as has been traditionally stated, or in the town of Zafra in Badajoz Province, Spain. His father was singer and teacher Manuel del Pópulo Vicente Rodriguez García (Manuel García I, 1775–1832). His sisters were Maria Malibran (1808–1836) and Pauline Viardot (1821–1910). After abandoning his onstage career as a baritone, García began to teach at the Paris Conservatory (1830–48) and the Royal Academy of Music, London (1848–95). Jessie Bond, Camille Everardi, Erminia Frezzolini, Julius Günther, Jenny Lind, Mathilde Marchesi, Christina Nilsson, Julia Ettie Crane, Georgina Schubert, Julius Stockhausen, Marie Tempest, Charles Santley and Henry Wood were among his pupils. He invented a laryngoscope in 1854 and the next year published observations of his own larynx and vocal cords made with a small dental mirror introduced into the throat and using sunlight reflected by another mirror. He has been credited with saving the career of Jenny Lind, who had suffered vocal damage from overwork in her early twenties. García was interested in movements connected with the production of the singing voice and did not anticipate the importance of laryngoscopy for medicine. Still, the University of Königsberg conferred upon him the honorary degree of M.D. He died in London in 1906 at the age of 101 years and was buried in the churchyard of St. Edward&#x27;s Catholic church in Sutton Green, Surrey. His grave gives details of his many famous pupils and accomplishments.

On 22 November 1832 in Paris García married the operatic soprano Cécile Eugénie Mayer (Paris, 8 April 1814 – Paris, 12 August 1880). They had two sons Manuel (1836–1885) Gustave (1837–1925) and two daughters, Eugenie Harouel (1840–1924) and Marie Crèpet (1842–1867). His second son Gustave Garcia (1 February 1837 – 1925) was a singer, actor, and author of three books on vocal and stage techniques. Gustave&#x27;s son, Albert García (1875–1946), studied voice with his great aunt (Pauline Viardot), became a respected baritone, and produced an edition of his grandfather&#x27;s treatise on singing (1924).

From second wife Beata Elena Rodriguez (+ 19 April 1917) were born 2 daughters, Paula (+ 1 May 1960) wife from 1901 of Major George McKenzie Franks (1868–1958) – and Manuela Beata Carmen (+ 5 March 1924).

<text>Balkh is a town in the Balkh Province of Afghanistan. It is located approximately to the northwest of the provincial capital city Mazar-i-Sharif and approximately to the south of the Amu Darya and the Afghanistan–Uzbekistan border. In 2021–2022, the National Statistics and Information Authority reported that the town had 138,594 residents. Listed as the eighth largest settlement in the country, unofficial 2024 estimates set its population at around 114,883 people.

Historically, the site of present-day Balkh was held in considerably high regard due to its religious and political significance in Ariana. A hub of Zoroastrianism and Buddhism, the ancient city was also known to the Persians as Zariaspa and to the Greeks as Bactra, giving its name to Bactria. As such, it was famously known as the capital of Bactria or Tokharistan. The Italian explorer and writer Marco Polo described Balkh as &quot;a noble city and a great seat of learning&quot; prior to the Mongol conquests. Most of the town now consists of ruined buildings, situated some from the right bank of the seasonally flowing Balkh River, at an elevation of about .

While it is one of Afghanistan&#x27;s ethnically diverse settlements, Tajiks account for the majority of Balkh&#x27;s populace and have continuously inhabited the site for millennia. The main language of the town is Dari, which is spoken by a significant majority. Balkh&#x27;s surrounding region is particularly known for its archeological sites, which attest the presence of many different civilizations that influenced the town&#x27;s society in various eras. The Belgian-French explorer and spiritualist Alexandra David-Néel associated Balkh with Shambhala, a mythical kingdom that features prominently in ancient Tibetan Buddhism, and also offered the Persian &quot;Sham-i-Bala&quot; () as an etymology of its name. In a similar vein, the British author John G. Bennett, whose academic focus was on the teachings of the Armenian-Greek mystic George Gurdjieff, speculated in his works that Shambhala may have been a Bactrian Sun temple called &quot;Shams-i-Balkh&quot;, taking note of the Afghan author and mystic Idries Shah as the source of this suggestion.

==Etymology==
The true origin of the name Balkh is unknown. Wilhelm Eilers proposed that the region was named after the Balkh River (in Greek transliteration Βάκτρος, i.e. &quot;Baktros&quot;) from underlying &quot;Bāxtri-&quot;, itself meaning &#x27;she who divides&#x27;, etymologically from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;&quot; &#x27;to divide&#x27; (whence also Avestan and Old Indic ).

The Bactrian language name of the city was βαχλο, i.e. &quot;Bakhlo&quot;. In Middle Persian texts, it was named &quot;Baxl,&quot; i.e. &quot;Bakhl&quot; &quot;(&quot;). The name of the province or country also appears in the Old Persian inscriptions (B.h.i 16; Dar Pers e.16; Nr. a.23) as &quot;Bāxtri&quot;, i.e. &quot;Bakhtri (&quot;). It is written in the Avesta as &quot;Bāxδi&quot; () . From this came the intermediate form &quot;Bāxli&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;Bahlīka&quot; (also &quot;Balhika&quot;) for &quot;Bactrian&quot;, and by transposition the modern Persian &quot;Balx&quot;, i.e. &quot;Balkh&quot;, and Armenian &quot;Bahl&quot;. This same root entered the Greek language as &quot;Baktra&quot; (Ancient Greek: Βάκτρα), often written in the form &quot;Bactra&quot;.

An earlier name for Balkh or a term for part of the city was &quot;Zariaspa&quot; (Ancient Greek: Ζαρίασπα), which may derive from the important Zoroastrian fire temple Azar-i-Asp or from a Median name meaning &quot;having gold-coloured horses&quot;.

The nickname of Balkh is &quot;the Mother of All Cities&quot;.

==History==
Balkh was earlier considered to be the first city to which the ancient Iranic peoples moved from north of the Amu Darya (also known as the Oxus in Greek), between 2000 and 1500 BC. However it was only recently that archaeological remains before 500 BC were found by French archaeologists led by Johanna Lhullier and Julio Bendezu-Sarmiento in the section called Bala Hissar, which is the citadel of the site. They dated this first settlement to the Early Iron Age (Yaz I period, -1000 BC) continuing until pre-Achaemenid times (Yaz II period, c. 1000-540 BC). Bala Hissar is located at the north of the site and is oval in shape, having an area of around 1,500 by 1,000 m2 (c. 150 hectares) and to the south is the lower town. Another mound of the site, known as Tepe Zargaran, and the Northern Fortification Wall of Balkh, were occupied at a large extension in Achaemenid times (Yaz III period, c. 540-330 BC).

Since the Iranic people built one of their first kingdoms in Balkh, some scholars believe that it was from this area that different waves of Iranic tribes spread to north-east Iran and Seistan region. The changing climate has led to desertification since antiquity, when the region was very fertile. Its foundation is mythically ascribed to Keyumars, the first king of the world in Persian legend; and it is at least certain that, at a very early date, it was the rival of Ecbatana, Nineveh and Babylon.

The city was traditionally a center of Zoroastrianism. 
For a long time the city and country was the central seat of the dualistic Zoroastrian religion, the founder of which, Zoroaster, died within the walls according to the Persian poet Firdowsi. Armenian sources state that the Arsacid dynasty of the Parthian Empire established its capital in Balkh. There is a long-standing tradition that an ancient shrine of Anahita was to be found here, a temple so rich it invited plunder.

Alexander the Great married Roxana of Bactria after killing the king of Balkh in the 4th century BC, and brought the Greek culture and religion to the region. The city was one of the capitals of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and was besieged for three years by the Seleucid Empire under king Antiochus III the Great. After the demise of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, it was ruled by Indo-Scythians, Parthians, Indo-Parthians, Kushan Empire, Indo-Sassanids, Kidarites, Hephthalite Empire and Sassanid Persians before the arrival of the Arabs.

===Ancient Bactrian religion===
Bactrian documents - in the Bactrian language, written from the fourth to eighth centuries - consistently evoke the name of local deities, such as Kamird and Wakhsh, for example, as witnesses to contracts. The documents come from an area between Balkh and Bamiyan, which is part of Bactria.
===Zoroastrianism and Buddhism===

Balkh is well known to Buddhists as the hometown of Trapusa and Bahalika, two merchants who, according to scripture, became Buddha&#x27;s first disciples. They were the first to offer Buddha food after he attained enlightenment, and in return Buddha gave them eight of his hairs to remember him by. According to some accounts, Trapusa and Bahalika returned to Balkh, and built two stupas in the way Buddha instructed. Balkh is therefore named after Bahalika, who is credited with introducing Buddhism to the city. This is reflected in literature, where the town has been called &quot;Balhika&quot;, &quot;Bahlika&quot; or &quot;Valhika&quot;. The first Buddhist monastery (&quot;vihara&quot;) at Balkh was built for Bahalika when he returned home after becoming a Buddhist monk.

The Chinese pilgrim Faxian (337-422 CE) traveled to the region in the early 5th century, and found Hinayana Buddhism prevalent in Shan Shan, Kucha, Kashgar, Osh, Udayana and Gandhara. Later, the Chinese monk Xuanzang (602–664 CE) visited Balkh in 630 CE, when it was a flourishing centre of Hinayana Buddhism. According to his memoirs, there were about a hundred Buddhist convents in the city or its vicinity at the time of his visit. There were 3,000 monks and a large number of stupas and other religious monuments. Xuanzang also remarked that Buddhism was widely practiced by the Hunnish rulers of Balkh, who were descended from Indian royal stock.

During the 8th century, the Korean monk and traveler Hyecho (704–787 CE) recorded that even after the Arab invasion, the residents of Balkh continued to practice Buddhism and followed a Buddhist king. He noted that the king of Balkh at the time had fled to nearby Badakshan.

The most remarkable Buddhist monastery was the Nava Vihara (&quot;New Temple&quot;), which possessed a gigantic statue of Gautama Buddha. Located near the city of Balkh, it served as a pilgrimage centre for political leaders who came from far and wide to pay homage to it. Shortly before the Arab conquest, the monastery became a Zoroastrian fire-temple. A curious reference to this building is found in the writings of the geographer Ibn Hawqal, an Arab traveler of the 10th century, who describes Balkh as built of clay, with ramparts and six gates, and extending for half a &quot;parasang&quot;. He also mentions a castle and a mosque.

A large number of Sanskrit medical, pharmacological, and toxicological texts were translated into Arabic under the patronage of Khalid, the vizier of Al-Mansur. Khalid was the son of a chief priest of a Buddhist monastery. Some of the family were killed when the Arabs captured Balkh; others including Khalid survived by converting to Islam. They would later come to be known as the Barmakids of Baghdad.

===Judaism===
Sennacherib, who reigned over the Neo-Assyrian Empire from 705 to 681 BCE, is said to have forcibly transferred some Israelites to Balkh after dispossessing them from the Kingdom of Israel during the Assyrian captivity. This account is discussed in the works of the Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi, who wrote that the arrival and establishment of the Jews in Balkh had occurred in light of Sennacherib&#x27;s campaign in the Levant. Additionally, a number of geographers from the Arab world attested the existence of a monument called Bāb al-Yahūd () and a settlement called al-Yahūdiyya at the site of Balkh. Some Muslims believe that the Israelite prophet Jeremiah fled to Balkh during the Babylonian captivity and that the Israelite prophet Ezekiel was buried there, though Jews revere Ezekiel&#x27;s Tomb in modern-day Iraq as the site of his final resting place.

Balkh&#x27;s Jewish community was further noted in the Ghaznavid Empire during the 11th century, when Jews were forced to maintain a garden for Mahmud of Ghazni and pay a minority tax of 500 dirhams. According to Jewish oral history, under Timur of the Timurid Empire, the Jews of Balkh were given a gated city quarter of their own to live in.

There was still a substantial Jewish community in Balkh as late as 1885, as attested by the British administrator Charles Yate following the Second Anglo-Afghan War: &quot;a considerable colony of Jews, who have a separate quarter of the village to themselves, and appeared, so far as we could judge, to be fair-looking men with most unmistakably Jewish features.&quot;

Hiwi al-Balkhi, a 9th-century exegete and Bible critic, was born in Balkh and is widely believed to have been a Bukharan Jew, at least by ethnicity, as some scholars have asserted that he was a practicing gnostic Christian.

=== Arab conquests and Islamization ===

At the time of the Islamic conquest of Persia in the 7th century, however, Balkh had provided an outpost of resistance and a safe haven for the Persian emperor Yazdegerd III who fled there from the armies of Umar. Later, in the 9th century, during the reign of Ya&#x27;qub bin Laith as-Saffar, Islam became firmly rooted in the local population.Arabs occupied Persia in 642 (during the Caliphate of Uthman, 644–656 AD). Attracted by the grandeur and wealth of Balkh, they attacked it in 645 AD. It was only in 653 when Arab commander al-Ahnaf raided the town again and compelled it to pay tribute. The Arab hold over the town, however, remained tenuous. The area was brought under Arab control only after it was reconquered by Muawiya in 663 AD. Prof. Upasak describes the effect of this conquest in these words: &quot;The Arabs plundered the town and killed the people indiscriminately. It is said that they raided the famous Buddhist shrine of Nava-Vihara, which the Arab historians call &#x27;Nava Bahara&#x27; and describe it as one of the magnificent places, which comprised a range of 360 cells around the high stupas&#x27;. They plundered the gems and jewels that were studded on many images and stupas and took away the wealth accumulated in the Vihara but probably did no considerable harm to other monastic buildings or to the monks residing there&quot;.

The Arab attacks had little effect on the normal ecclesiastical life in the monasteries or Balkh Buddhist population outside. Buddhism continued to flourish with their monasteries as the centres of Buddhist learning and training. Scholars, monks and pilgrims from China, India and Korea continued to visit this place. Several revolts were made against the Arab rule in Balkh.

The Arabs&#x27; control over Balkh did not last long as it soon came under the rule of a local prince, a zealous Buddhist called Nazak (or Nizak) Tarkhan. He expelled the Arabs from his territories in 670 or 671. He is said to have not only reprimanded the Chief Priest (Barmak) of Nava-Vihara but beheaded him for embracing Islam. As per another account, when Balkh was conquered by the Arabs, the head priest of the Nava-Vihara had gone to the capital and became a Muslim. This displeased the people of the Balkh. He was deposed and his son was placed in his position.

Nazak Tarkhan is also said to have murdered not only the Chief Priest but also his sons. Only a young son was saved. He was taken by his mother to Kashmir where he was given training in medicine, astronomy and other sciences. Later they returned to Balkh. Prof. Maqbool Ahmed observes &quot;One is tempted to think that the family originated from Kashmir, for in time of distress, they took refuge in the Valley. Whatever it be, their Kashmiri origin is undoubted and this also explains the deep interest of the Barmaks, in later years, in Kashmir, for we know they were responsible for inviting several scholars and physicians from Kashmir to the Court of Abbasids.&quot; Prof. Maqbool also refers to the descriptions of Kashmir contained in the report prepared by the envoy of Yahya bin Barmak. He surmises that the envoy could have possibly visited Kashmir during the reign of Samgramapida II (797–801). Reference has been made to sages and arts.

The Arabs managed to bring Balkh under their control only in 715 AD, in spite of strong resistance offered by the Balkh people during the Umayyad period. Qutayba ibn Muslim al-Bahili, an Arab General was Governor of Khurasan and the east from 705 to 715. He established a firm hold over lands beyond the Oxus for the Arabs. He fought and killed Tarkhan Nizak in Tokharistan (Bactria) in 715. In the wake of Arab conquest, the resident monks of the Vihara were either killed or forced to abandon their faith. The Viharas were razed to the ground. Priceless treasures in the form of manuscripts in the libraries of monasteries were consigned to ashes. Presently, only the ancient wall of the town, which once encircled it, stands partially. Nava-Vihara stands in ruins, near Takhta-i-Rustam. In 726, the Umayyad governor Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri rebuilt Balkh and installed in it an Arab garrison, while in his second governorship, a decade later, he transferred the provincial capital there.

The Umayyad period lasted until 747, when Abu Muslim captured it for the Abbasids (next Sunni Caliphate dynasty) during the Abbasid Revolution. The city remained in Abbasid hands until 861, when it was taken in 870 by the Saffarids captured it.

==== Iranic and Turkic dynasties ====

In 870, Ya&#x27;qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar rebelled against Abbasid rule and founded the Saffarid dynasty at Sistan. He captured present Afghanistan and most of present Iran. His successor Amr ibn al-Layth, tried to capture Transoxiana from the Samanids, who were nominally vassals of Abbasids, but he was defeated and captured by Ismail Samani at Battle of Balkh in 900. He was sent to the Abbasid Caliph as a prisoner and was executed in 902. The power of Saffarids was diminished and they became vassals of the Samanids. Thus Balkh now passed to them.

Samanid rule in Balkh lasted until 997, when their former subordinates, the Ghaznavids, captured it. In 1006, Balkh was captured by Karakhanids, but Ghaznavids recaptured it 1008. Finally, the Seljuks conquered Balkh in 1059. In 1115, it was occupied and looted by irregular Oghuz Turks. Between 1141 and 1142, Balkh was captured by Atsiz, Shah of Khwarezm, after the Seljuks were defeated by the Kara-Khitan Khanate at the Battle of Qatwan. Ahmad Sanjar decisively defeated a Ghurid army, commanded by Ala al-Din Husayn and he took him prisoner for two years before releasing him as a vassal of the Seljuks. The next year, he marched against rebellious Oghuz Turks from Khuttal and Tukharistan. But he was defeated twice and was captured after a second battle in Merv. The Oghuzs looted Khorasan after their victory.

Balkh was nominally ruled by Mahmud Khan, the former khan of Western Karakhanids, but the real power was held by Muayyid al-Din Ay Aba, amir of Nishabur for three years. Sanjar finally escaped from captivity and returned to Merv through Termez. He died in 1157 and control of Balkh passed to Mahmud Khan until his death in 1162. It was captured by Khwarezmshahs in 1162, by the Kara Khitans in 1165, by the Ghurids in 1198 and again by Khwarezmshahs in 1206.

Muhammad al-Idrisi, in the 12th century, speaks of its possessing a variety of educational establishments, and carrying on an active trade. There were several important commercial routes from the city, stretching as far east as India and China. The late 12th-century local chronicle &quot;The Merits of Balkh (Fada&#x27;il-i-Balkh)&quot;, by Abu Bakr Abdullah al-Wa&#x27;iz al-Balkhi, states that a woman known only as the &quot;khatun&quot; (lady) of Davud, from 848 appointed governor of Balkh, had taken over from him with &quot;particular responsibility for the city and people&quot; while he was busy building himself an elaborate pleasure palace called Nawshǎd (New Joy).

===Mongol conquest and destruction===
In 1220 Genghis Khan sacked Balkh, butchered its inhabitants and levelled all the buildings capable of defence – treatment to which it was again subjected in the 14th century by Timur. Notwithstanding this, however, Marco Polo (probably referring to its past) could still describe it as &quot;a noble city and a great seat of learning.&quot; For when Ibn Battuta visited Balkh around 1333 during the rule of the Kartids, who were Tadjik vassals of the Persia-based Mongol Ilkhanate until 1335, he described it as a city still in ruins: &quot;It is completely dilapidated and uninhabited, but anyone seeing it would think it to be inhabited because of the solidity of its construction (for it was a vast and important city), and its mosques and colleges preserve their outward appearance even now, with the inscriptions on their buildings incised with lapis-blue paints.&quot;

It was not reconstructed until 1338. It was captured by Tamerlane in 1389 and its citadel was destroyed, but Shah Rukh, his successor, rebuilt the citadel in 1407.

===16th to 19th centuries===

In 1506 Uzbeks entered Balkh under the command of Muhammad Shaybani. They were briefly expelled by the Safavids in 1510. Babur ruled Balkh between 1511 and 1512 as a vassal of the Persian Safavids. But he was defeated twice by the Khanate of Bukhara and was forced to retire to Kabul. Balkh was ruled by Bukhara except for Safavid rule between 1598 and 1601.

The Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan fruitlessly fought them there for several years in the 1640s. Nevertheless, Balkh was ruled by the Mughal Empire from 1641 and turned into a subah (imperial top-level province) in 1646 by Shah Jahan, only to be lost in 1647, just like the neighboring Badakhshan Subah. Balkh was the government seat of Aurangzeb in his youth. In 1736 it was conquered by Nader Shah. After his assassination, local Uzbek Hadji Khan declared the independence of Balkh in 1747, under the Maimana Khanate.

In 1751, Balkh was captured by Ahmad Shah Durrani of the Durrani Empire.

The area of Balkh was governed by the Uzbek Qataghan dynasty, with its capital in Khulm, for the majority of the early nineteenth century, and only nominally acknowledged Kabul&#x27;s suzerainty. During this time, the Qataghan dynasty also competed with Bukhara in interdynastic conflicts throughout the area. Only through the conquests of the Emirate of Kabul&#x27;s Dost Mohammad Khan in the 1850s (see also; Afghan Conquest of Balkh), followed by those of Abdur Rahman Khan in 1888, did the region of &quot;little Turkestan&quot; to the south of the Amu Darya (also known as Oxus River) become a permanent part of Afghanistan. By 1885, Charles Yate reported that the city was &quot;nothing but a vast ruin&quot; and that there were no more than 500 houses, occupied mostly by &quot;Afghan settlers&quot; and with &quot;very few Usbegs&quot; (i.e. Uzbeks).
In 1866, after a malaria outbreak during the flood season, Balkh lost its administrative status to the neighbouring city of Mazar-i-Sharif (&quot;Mazār-e Šarīf&quot;), about southeast of Balkh.

===20th to 21st centuries===

In 1911 Balkh comprised a settlement of about 500 houses of Afghan settlers, a colony of Jews and a small bazaar set in the midst of a waste of ruins and acres of debris. Entering by the west (&quot;Akcha&quot;) gate, one passed under three arches, in which the compilers recognized the remnants of the former &quot;Jama Masjid&quot; (, Friday Mosque). The outer walls, mostly in utter disrepair, were estimated about in perimeter. In the south-east, they were set high on a mound or rampart, which indicated a Mongol origin to the compilers.

The fort and citadel to the north-east were built well above the town on a barren mound and were walled and moated. There was, however, little left of them but the remains of a few pillars. The Green Mosque (), named for its green-tiled dome (see photograph top right corner) and said to be the tomb of the Khwaja Abu Nasr Parsa, had nothing but the arched entrance remaining of the former &quot;madrasah&quot; (, school).

The town was garrisoned as of 1911 by a few thousand irregulars (&quot;kasidars&quot;), the regular troops of Afghan Turkestan being cantoned at Takhtapul, near Mazari Sharif. The gardens to the north-east contained a caravanserai that formed one side of a courtyard, which was shaded by a group of chenar trees &quot;Platanus orientalis&quot;.

A project of modernization was undertaken in 1934, in which eight streets were laid out, housing and bazaars built. Modern Balkh is a centre of the cotton industry, of the skins known commonly in the West as &quot;Persian lamb&quot; (Karakul), and for agricultural produce like almonds and melons.

The site and the museum have suffered from looting and uncontrolled digging during the 1990s civil war. After the Taliban&#x27;s fall in 2001 some poor residents dug in an attempt to sell ancient treasures. The provisional Afghan government said in January 2002 that it had stopped the looting. On March 9, 2023, the Taliban appointed Governor of Balkh Mohammad Dawood Muzammil was killed in a bomb blast.

==Archaeological sites==
===Ancient Buddhist===
The earlier Buddhist constructions have proved more durable than the Islamic buildings. The Top-Rustam is in diameter at the base and at the top, circular and about high. Four circular vaults are sunk in the interior and four passages have been pierced below from the outside, which probably lead to them. The base of the building is constructed of sun-dried bricks about square and thick. The Takht-e Rustam is wedge-shaped in plan with uneven sides. It is apparently built of &quot;pisé&quot; mud (i.e. mud mixed with straw and puddled). It is possible that in these ruins we may recognize the &quot;Nava Vihara&quot; described by the Chinese traveller Xuanzang. There are the remains of many other topes (or stupas) in the neighbourhood.

The mounds of ruins on the road to Mazar-e Sharif probably represent the site of a city yet older than those on which stands the modern Balkh.

===Medieval Islamic===
Numerous places of interest are to be seen today aside from the ancient ruins and fortifications:
*The &quot;madrasa&quot; of Sayed Subhan Quli Khan.
*Bala-Hesar, the shrine and mosque of Khwaja Nasr Parsa.
*The tomb of the poet Rabi&#x27;a Balkhi.
*The Nine Domes Mosque (&quot;Masjid-e Noh Gonbad&quot;). This exquisitely ornamented mosque, also referred to as &quot;Haji Piyada&quot;, is the earliest Islamic monument yet identified in Afghanistan.
*Tepe Rustam and Takht-e Rustam

=== Displays at the Balkh Museum ===
The museum was formerly the second largest museum in the country, but its collection has suffered from looting in recent times.

The museum is also known as the Museum of the Blue Mosque, from the building it shares with a religious library. As well as exhibits from the ancient ruins of Balkh, the collection includes works of Islamic art including a 13th-century Quran, and examples of Afghan decorative and folk art.

==Notable people==
Balkh had a major role in the development of the Persian language and literature. The early works of Persian literature were written by poets and writers who were originally from Balkh.

<doc id="332848" wikidata="Q1718769" url="?curid=332848" title="List of mayors of Toronto">
<text>Below is a list of mayors of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Toronto&#x27;s first mayor, William Lyon Mackenzie, was appointed in 1834 after his Reform coalition won the new City of Toronto&#x27;s first election and he was chosen by the Reformers. The most recent election to the office of mayor was a by-election on June 26, 2023 in which Olivia Chow was elected. Chow formally took office on July 12, 2023.

If a vacancy occurs, the &quot;City of Toronto Act&quot; explicitly states that the deputy mayor of Toronto assumes certain limited mayoral powers, but remains deputy mayor during a vacancy. They do not become an &quot;acting&quot; or &quot;interim mayor&quot;.

==History==
From 1834 to 1857, and again from 1867 to 1873, Toronto mayors were not elected directly by the public. Instead, after each annual election of aldermen and councilmen, the assembled council would elect one of their members as mayor. For all other years, mayors were directly elected by popular vote, except in rare cases where a mayor was appointed by council to fill an unexpired term of office. Prior to 1834, Toronto municipal leadership was governed by the Chairman of the General Quarter Session of Peace of the Home District Council.

Through 1955 the term of office for the mayor and council was one year; it then varied between two and three years until a four-year term was adopted starting in 2006. (See List of Toronto municipal elections.)

John Tory, who served from 2014 to 2023, resigned as mayor in February 2023; Deputy Mayor Jennifer McKelvie had assumed some mayoral responsibilities as a result until a successor was chosen.

The &quot;City of Toronto&quot; has changed substantially over the years: the city annexed or amalgamated with neighbouring communities or areas 49 times from in 1883 to 1967. The most sweeping change was in 1998, when the six municipalities comprising Metropolitan Toronto—East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough, York, and the former city of Toronto–and its regional government were amalgamated into a single City of Toronto (colloquially dubbed the &quot;megacity&quot;) by an act of the provincial government. The newly created position of mayor for the resulting single-tier mega-city replaced all of the mayors of the former Metro municipalities. It also abolished the office of the Metro Chairman, which had formerly been the most senior political figure in the Metro government before amalgamation.

According to Victor Loring Russell, author of &quot;Mayors of Toronto Volume I&quot;, 14 out of the first 29 mayors were lawyers. According to Mark Maloney who is writing &quot;The History of the Mayors of Toronto&quot;, 58 of Toronto&#x27;s 64 mayors (up to Ford) have been Protestant, white, English-speaking, Anglo-Saxon, property-owning males. There have been three women (Hall, Rowlands, and Chow) and three Jewish mayors (Phillips, Givens and Lastman).

Art Eggleton is the longest-serving mayor of Toronto, serving from 1980 until 1991. Eggleton later served in federal politics from 1993 until 2004, and was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 2005. David Breakenridge Read held the post of mayor of Toronto for the shortest period; Read was mayor for only fifty days in 1858.

No Toronto mayor has been removed from office. Toronto&#x27;s 64th mayor, Rob Ford, lost a conflict of interest trial in 2012, and was ordered to vacate his position; but the ruling was stayed pending an appeal, which Ford won to remain in office. Due to his substance abuse admission and controversy in 2013, Council stripped him of many powers on November 15, transferring them to the deputy mayor. From May until July, 2014, Ford took a leave of absence from the mayoralty to enter drug rehabilitation.

==Original City of Toronto era ==



==Metro Toronto era (1953–1997)==
From 1953, Toronto was part of a federated municipality known as Metropolitan Toronto. This regional entity had the same boundaries as present-day Toronto, but consisted of the City of Toronto and 12 other municipalities, each with its own mayor and council. From 1953 to 1997, the most senior political figure in the Metropolitan Toronto government was the Chairman of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (for a list of Metro Chairmen, see &quot;Chairman of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto&quot;). In 1967, (during the incumbency of William Dennison), an internal amalgamation eliminated the seven smallest municipalities in Metropolitan Toronto. Of these, the villages of Forest Hill and Swansea were amalgamated into the City of Toronto.

==Post-amalgamation era==
As of 1998, Metropolitan Toronto and all its constituent municipalities were amalgamated into a single City of Toronto. Under the &quot;City of Toronto Act, 2006&quot;, the mayor is the head of council and the chief executive officer of the City.

The deputy mayor is appointed by the mayor from among the elected members of the City Council. The deputy mayor acts in place of the mayor whenever the incumbent is unable to be present to perform his normal functions and duties, assists the mayor, and serves as vice-chair of the city council&#x27;s executive committee.

On November 18, 2013, city council removed most powers from the office of mayor for the term of the current Council, including chairing the executive committee. These powers were given to the office of the deputy mayor, held by Norm Kelly at the time of the motion. The action occurred after Mayor Rob Ford admitted to drug abuse. On May 1, 2014, Ford started a leave of absence for drug rehabilitation. Kelly took over the remainder of the mayoral duties and powers at that time. When Rob Ford returned on July 1, he once again returned to having the duties he had immediately prior to the leave.

On February 10, 2023, Mayor John Tory announced that he would resign as the mayor, after admitting that he had had a multi-year affair with a former staffer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tory also said that the relationship had been referred to the City&#x27;s integrity commissioner for review. Deputy Mayor Jennifer McKelvie performed the duties of the mayor&#x27;s office with limited powers, until the election of Tory&#x27;s successor. On June 26, 2023, Chow was elected as mayor of Toronto. She took office on July 12, 2023.

<doc id="332849" wikidata="Q464103" url="?curid=332849" title="Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Speaker of the House of Commons is the presiding officer of the House of Commons, the lower house and primary chamber of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The current speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, was elected Speaker on 4th of November 2019, following the retirement of John Bercow. Hoyle began his first full parliamentary term in the role on 17th of December 2019, having been unanimously re-elected after the 2019 general election.

The speaker presides over the House&#x27;s debates, determining which members may speak and which amendments are selected for consideration. The speaker is also responsible for maintaining order during debate, and may punish members who break the rules of the House. By convention, the Speaker is strictly non-partisan; accordingly, a Speaker is expected to renounce all affiliation with their former political parties when taking office and afterwards.

The speaker does not take part in debate or vote (except to break ties; and even then, the convention is that the speaker casts the tie-breaking vote according to Speaker Denison&#x27;s rule which results either in further debate or a vote for the status quo). Aside from duties relating to presiding over the House, the speaker also performs administrative and procedural functions. In addition, they remain a constituency Member of Parliament (MP), are part of the Privy Council, and represent the Commons to the monarch, the House of Lords and other authorities. The official residence of the Speaker is the Speaker&#x27;s House at the Palace of Westminster.

==History==

===Early history===
The office of the speaker is almost as old as the Parliament itself. The earliest year for which a presiding officer has been identified is 1258, when Peter de Montfort presided over the Parliament held in Oxford. Early presiding officers were known by the title &quot;parlour&quot; or &quot;prolocutor&quot;. The continuous history of the office of speaker is held to date from 1376 when Peter de la Mare spoke for the commons in the &quot;Good Parliament&quot; as they joined leading magnates in purging the chief ministers of the Crown and the most unpopular members of the king&#x27;s household. Edward III was frail and in seclusion; his prestigious eldest son, Edward the Black Prince, terminally ill. It was left to the next son, a furious John of Gaunt, to fight back. He arrested De la Mare and disgraced other leading critics.

In the next, &quot;Bad Parliament&quot;, in 1377, a cowed Commons put forward Gaunt&#x27;s steward, Thomas Hungerford, as their spokesman in retracting their predecessors&#x27; misdeeds of the previous year. Gaunt evidently wanted a &quot;mirror-image&quot; as his form of counter-coup and this notion, born in crisis, of one &#x27;speaker&#x27;, who quickly also became &#x27;chairman&#x27; and organiser of the Commons&#x27; business, was recognised as valuable and took immediate root after 1376–1377.

On 6 October 1399, John Cheyne of Beckford (Gloucester) was elected speaker. The powerful Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Arundel, is said to have voiced his fears of Cheyne&#x27;s reputation as a critic of the Church. Eight days later, Cheyne resigned on grounds of ill-health, although he remained in favour with the king and active in public life for a further 14 years.

Although the officer was elected by the Commons at the start of each Parliament, with at least one contested election known, in 1420 (Roger Hunt prevailing by a majority of just four votes), in practice the Crown was usually able to get whom it wanted. Whilst the principle of giving this spokesman personal immunity from recrimination as only being the voice of the whole body was quickly adopted and did enhance the Commons&#x27; role, the Crown found it useful to have one person with the authority to select and lead the lower house&#x27;s business and responses to the Crown&#x27;s agenda, much more often than not in the way the Crown wanted. Thus, Whig ideas of the Commons growing in authority as against royal power are somewhat simplistic; the Crown used the Commons as and when it found it advantageous to do so, and the speakership was one means to make the Commons a more cohesive, defined and effective instrument of the king&#x27;s government.

Throughout the medieval and early modern period, every speaker was an MP for a county, reflecting the implicit position that such shire representatives were of greater standing in the house than the more numerous burgess (municipality) MPs. Although evidence is almost non-existent, it has been surmised that any vote was by count of head, but by the same token perhaps the lack of evidence of actual votes suggests that most decisions, at least of a general kind, were reached more through persuasion and the weight by status of the county MPs. In such a situation, the influence of the speaker should not be underestimated. Thomas More was the first speaker to go on to become Lord Chancellor.

===17th to mid-19th century===
Until the 17th century, members of the House of Commons often continued to view their speaker (correctly) as an agent of the Crown. As Parliament evolved, however, the speaker&#x27;s position grew to involve more duties to the House than to the Crown; this was definitely true by the time of the English Civil War. This change is sometimes said to be reflected by an incident in 1642, when King Charles I entered the House in order to search for and arrest five members for high treason. When the King asked him if he knew of the location of these members, the speaker, William Lenthall, replied: &quot;May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.&quot;

The development of Cabinet government under King William III in the late 17th century caused further change in the role of the speaker. Speakers were generally associated with the ministry, and often held other government offices. For example, Robert Harley served simultaneously as Speaker and as a Secretary of State between 1704 and 1705.

The speaker between 1728 and 1761, Arthur Onslow, reduced ties with the government, though the office remained to a large degree political.

===The modern speakership===
The speakership evolved into its modern form—in which the holder is an impartial and apolitical officer who does not belong to any party—only during the middle of the 19th century.

Over 150 individuals have served as Speaker of the House of Commons. Their names are inscribed in gold leaf around the upper walls of Room C of the House of Commons Library. Betty Boothroyd, elected in 1992, was the first female speaker (the first woman to sit in the speaker&#x27;s chair was Betty Harvie Anderson, a Deputy Speaker from 1970). Michael Martin, elected in 2000, was the first Catholic speaker since the Reformation. John Bercow, elected in 2009, was the first Jewish speaker.

The speaker has significant influence on legislation, for example by selecting which amendments to a bill may be proposed, and by interpreting and enforcing the rules of Parliament as laid out in the official parliamentary rulebook, &quot;Erskine May&quot;. In 2019 Speaker John Bercow had significant influence in selecting which important amendments to legislation affecting Britain&#x27;s exit from the European Union could be voted on, and later by not allowing the government to repeat a vote on the terms of exit, as the same motion may not be proposed twice in the same session of Parliament. Bercow was criticised for these interventions, but said that he was acting within his powers and enforcing clear rules in a non-partisan way.

Until 1992, all speakers were men, and were always addressed in Parliament as &quot;Mr Speaker&quot;, and their deputies as &quot;Mr Deputy Speaker&quot;. Betty Boothroyd was, at her request, addressed as &quot;Madam Speaker&quot;. When Betty Harvie Anderson served in the 1970s as a Deputy Speaker, on the other hand, she was addressed as &quot;Mr Deputy Speaker&quot;. Eleanor Laing, who was a Deputy Speaker from 2013 to 2019 and again from 2020 to 2024, was addressed as &quot;Madam Deputy Speaker&quot;.

The speaker has traditionally been offered a life peerage in the House of Lords upon stepping down – even if ousted following a political scandal. This tradition was broken in 2020 when John Bercow became the first Speaker in 230 years to step down and not be nominated for the Lords by the government.

==Election==

MPs elect the speaker from amongst their own ranks. The House must elect a Speaker at the beginning of each new parliamentary term after a general election, or after the death or resignation of the incumbent. Once elected, a Speaker continues in office until the dissolution of Parliament, unless they resign prior to this. Customarily, the House re-elects speakers who desire to continue in office for more than one term. Theoretically, the House could vote against re-electing a Speaker, but such an event is contrary to historical convention. Charles Manners-Sutton, 1st Viscount Canterbury was the last Speaker who was not re-elected (this happened in 1835).

The procedure for electing a Speaker has changed in recent years. Until 1971, the Clerk of the House of Commons became temporary Chairman of the House. As the clerk is never a member, and therefore is not permitted to speak, he would silently stand and point at the member who was to speak. However, this procedure broke down at the election of a new Speaker in 1971 (see below) and had to be changed. Since that time, as recommended by a Select committee, the Father of the House (the member of the House with the longest period of unbroken service who is not a minister) becomes the presiding officer.

Until 2001, the election of a Speaker was conducted as a routine matter of House of Commons business, as it used motions and amendments to elect. A member would move &quot;That Mr(s) [X] do take the Chair of this House as Speaker&quot;, and following debate (which may have included an amendment to replace the name of the member on whom the speakership was to be conferred), a routine division of the House would resolve in favour of one candidate. There was, however, a considerable amount of behind-the-scenes lobbying before suitable candidates were agreed upon, and so it was very rare for a new speaker to be opposed. However, this system broke down in 2000 when twelve rival candidates declared for the job and the debate occupied an entire parliamentary day. The House of Commons Procedure Committee then re-examined the means of electing a speaker and recommended a new system that came into effect in 2007 and was first used in June 2009, following the resignation of Michael Martin.

Under the new system, candidates must be nominated by at least twelve members, of whom at least three must be of a different party from the candidate. Each member may nominate no more than one candidate. The House then votes by secret ballot; an absolute majority (i.e. more than 50% of the votes cast) is required for victory. If no candidate wins a majority, then the individual with the fewest votes is eliminated, as are any other candidates who receive less than 5% of the votes cast, and as are any candidates who choose to withdraw. The House continues to vote, for several rounds if necessary, until one member receives the requisite majority. Then, the House votes on a formal motion to appoint the member in question to the speakership. (In the unlikely event that this motion fails, the House must hold a fresh series of ballots on all of the nominees.)

If only one candidate is nominated, then no ballot is held, and the House proceeds directly to the motion to appoint the candidate to the speakership. A similar procedure is used if a Speaker seeks a further term after a general election: no ballot is held, and the House immediately votes on a motion to re-elect the speaker. If this motion fails, candidates are nominated, and the House proceeds with voting (as described above).

Upon the passage of the motion, the speaker-elect is expected to show reluctance at being chosen; they are customarily &quot;dragged unwillingly&quot; by MPs to the speaker&#x27;s bench. This custom has its roots in the speaker&#x27;s original function of communicating the Commons&#x27; opinions to the monarch. Historically, the speaker, representing the House to the monarch, potentially faced the monarch&#x27;s anger and therefore required some persuasion to accept the post. Contrary to an often repeated claim, no speaker has ever been executed for his actions in that capacity. Six former speakers were executed between 1471 and 1535 (sometimes many years after their terms); for five of these, the execution was due to behaviour in subsequent offices.

The speaker-elect must receive approbation by the sovereign before they may take office; this has only been refused once, in 1679, to Edward Seymour. On the day of the election, the speaker-elect leads the Commons to the Chamber of the House of Lords, where Lords Commissioners appointed by the Crown confirm him or her in the monarch&#x27;s name. The speaker then requests &quot;in the name and on behalf of the Commons of the United Kingdom, to lay claim, by humble petition to His Majesty, to all their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges, especially to freedom of speech in debate, to freedom from arrest, and to free access to His Majesty whenever occasion shall require.&quot; After the Lords Commissioners, on the behalf of the sovereign, confirm the Commons&#x27; rights and privileges, the Commons return to their chamber. If a speaker is chosen in the middle of a parliament due to a vacancy in the office, they must receive the royal approbation as described above but does not again lay claim to the Commons&#x27; rights and privileges.

===Notable elections===

Though the election of a Speaker is normally non-partisan, there have been several controversial elections in history. For example, in 1895, the sudden retirement of Arthur Peel came at a time when partisan feelings were running high. The Conservatives and Liberal Unionists put forward Matthew White Ridley, a well-respected MP who had many years of experience, and hoped for a unanimous election as the previous speaker had been a Liberal. However, the Liberals decided to oppose him and nominated William Court Gully who had been an MP for only nine years and had been a relatively quiet presence. On a party-line vote, Gully was chosen by 285 to 274. Although Gully proved his impartiality to the satisfaction of most of his opponents and was unanimously re-elected after the 1895 general election, the episode left many Unionists bitter. During that year&#x27;s general election, Gully became one of the few speakers to be opposed in his own constituency, a sign of the bitterness of the time. It was not until the mid-1930s that it became common for a speaker to face some form of opposition for re-election.

The 1951 election was similarly controversial. After the incumbent speaker, Douglas Clifton Brown, retired at the 1951 general election, there was a great demand from the Labour Party for Major James Milner to become the first Labour speaker after he had served as deputy speaker for eight years. However, the Conservatives (who had just regained power) nominated William Shepherd Morrison against him. The vote again went down party lines, and Morrison was elected. Milner received a peerage as compensation.

In 1971, having had early warning that Horace King would be retiring, the Conservatives took the lead in offering to the Labour Party either Selwyn Lloyd or John Boyd-Carpenter as potential speakers. The Labour Party chose Selwyn Lloyd, partly because he was perceived as a weak figure. However, when the House of Commons debated the new speaker, Conservative MP Robin Maxwell-Hyslop and Labour MP Willie Hamilton nominated Geoffrey de Freitas, a senior and respected backbench Labour MP. De Freitas was taken aback by the sudden nomination and urged the House not to support him (a genuine feeling, unlike the feigned reluctance which all speakers traditionally show). Lloyd was elected, but there was a feeling among all parties that the system of election needed to be overhauled. A candidate&#x27;s consent is now required before they can be nominated.

Bernard Weatherill had announced his impending retirement a long time before the 1992 general election, leading to a long but suppressed campaign for support. Betty Boothroyd, a Labour MP who had been a deputy speaker, was known to be extremely interested in becoming the first woman speaker (and in doing so, finished the chances of fellow Labour MP Harold Walker who had also been a deputy speaker). The Conservative former Cabinet member Peter Brooke was put forward at a late stage as a candidate. Unlike previous elections, there was an active campaign among Conservative MPs to support Boothroyd and about 70 of them did so, ensuring her election. She was the only speaker elected in the 20th century not to be a member of the governing party at the time of her first election.

Betty Boothroyd announced her retirement shortly before the summer recess in 2000, which left a long time for would-be speakers to declare their candidature but little opportunity for Members of Parliament to negotiate and decide on who should be chosen. Many backbench Labour MPs advanced the claims of Michael Martin. Most Conservatives felt strongly that the recent alternation between the main parties ought to be maintained and a Conservative speaker chosen. The most prominent Conservative choices were George Young and Deputy Speaker Alan Haselhurst. With several additional candidates announcing themselves, the total number of Members seeking the speakership was 14, none of whom would withdraw. A lengthy sitting of the House saw Michael Martin first proposed, then each of the other candidates proposed in turn as amendments, which were all voted down. In points of order before the debate, many members demanded a secret ballot.

==Removal==
There is no formal process for removing the Speaker. Ed Selkirk Ford of the Constitution Society has suggested this is a deliberate protection against a majority government removing a speaker they are displeased with on a whim.

The House may pass a non-binding motion expressing no confidence in the Speaker, which can make their position unsustainable in the face of opposition from a sizeable portion of MPs. The Speaker can be removed by losing their seat as an MP, for example through disqualification, expulsion, or a successful recall petition.

==Non-partisanship==

By (post 19th century) convention the speaker severs all ties with their political party while in office, as it is considered essential they be seen as an impartial presiding officer. Many have served in ministerial or other political positions beforehand. For example, Selwyn Lloyd and George Thomas had both served as high-ranking Cabinet members and Bernard Weatherill and Betty Boothroyd had been party whips.

In the House, the speaker does not vote on any motion, except to resolve ties (see section below). By modern convention the deputies (actively presiding roles) adhere to this and number one from the speaker&#x27;s former party, and two from the other side of the House. Thus no net voting power is lost for government or the opposition.

After leaving office, the speaker normally takes no part in party politics; if elevated to the House of Lords, they would normally sit as a crossbencher. If a former speaker desires to be (re-)elected to the Commons, they may rejoin their pre-speakership party.

=== Seat in Parliament ===
The speaker will customarily seek re-election at a general election not under a party label – being entitled to describe themselves on the ballot as &quot;The Speaker seeking re-election&quot;. In the past they could be returned unopposed, but this has not happened since 1931. The main (usually two) parties taking part in the offsetting of three Deputies and Speaker (i.e. two each) seldom field opponents by logic and convention; opponents are deemed to question the speaker&#x27;s role, performance or means of appointment if they stand.

When ex-Tory Edward FitzRoy was opposed by a Labour Party candidate at the 1935 general election, there was strong disapproval from other parties and a sub-committee of the Cabinet considered whether a mechanism should be created to facilitate the Speaker&#x27;s automatic re-election (as is done for the speaker of the lower house of the Irish parliament). The sub-committee concluded that parliamentary opinion would not favour this suggestion. Likewise, in December 1938 the Commons rejected a motion from the prime minister for a Select Committee to re-examine the idea. The sub-committee, chaired by former Prime Minister David Lloyd George, reported in April 1939 that no change should be made; disallowing opposition to a sitting speaker would be &quot;a serious infringement of democratic principles&quot; and that &quot;to alter the status of the speaker, so that he ceased to be returned to the House of Commons by the same electoral methods as other members or as a representative of a Parliamentary constituency, would be equally repugnant to the custom and tradition of the House&quot;.

Labour and Liberal candidates opposed Selwyn Lloyd in both elections in 1974. Labour and the SDP stood against Bernard Weatherill in 1987. Speakers from Scottish and Welsh seats commonly face regionalist opponents: Plaid Cymru stood against George Thomas at his re-election, and Scottish National Party candidates stood against Michael Martin throughout, as their party constitution requires them to stand in all seats in Scotland, since October 1974. In 2010 Speaker John Bercow faced ten opponents, including Nigel Farage, former leader of the UK Independence Party polling 17.4% of the vote and John Stevens, from the Buckinghamshire Campaign for Democracy party polling 21.4%. Bercow won with 47% of the vote.

==Role==
===Presiding officer===
The speaker&#x27;s primary function is to preside over the House of Commons. According to parliamentary rules, the speaker is the highest authority of the House of Commons and has final say over how its business is conducted. Traditionally, the speaker when presiding wore court dressa black coat with white shirt and bands, beneath a black gown, with stockings and buckled shoes, and a full-bottomed wig. But in 1992 Betty Boothroyd, the first female speaker, eschewed the wig. Her successor, Michael Martin, also declined to wear the wig; moreover, he chose to simplify other aspects of the costume, doing away with the once customary buckled court shoes and silk stockings. His successor John Bercow abandoned traditional dress, wearing a plain black gown over his lounge suit when presiding. For ceremonial occasions such as the State Opening, the speaker wears a black and gold robe with a train; previously, this was worn over court dress with a white waterfall cravat, but the present speaker wears plain morning dress.

Whilst presiding, the speaker sits in a chair at the front of the House. Traditionally, members supporting the Government sit on the speaker&#x27;s right, and those in Opposition on the speaker&#x27;s left. The speaker&#x27;s powers are extensivemuch more so than those of the speaker&#x27;s counterpart in the House of Lords, the Lord Speaker. Most importantly, the speaker calls on members to speak; no member may make a speech without the speaker&#x27;s prior permission. By custom, the speaker alternates between members supporting the Government and those in Opposition. Members direct their speeches not to the whole House, but to the speaker, using the words &quot;Mister Speaker&quot; or &quot;Madam Speaker&quot;. Members must refer to each other in the third person by the name of their constituency or their ministerial titles (not their names); they may not directly address anyone other than the speaker (who does call them by name). In order to remain neutral, the speaker generally refrains from making speeches, although there is nothing to prevent him or her from doing so. For example, on Tuesday 1 September 2020, Speaker Hoyle addressed the House on the subject of the arrest of a Conservative MP for rape.

During debate, the speaker is responsible for maintaining discipline and order, and rules on all points of order (objections made by members asserting that a rule of the House has been broken – though sometimes used by a Member in a rhetorical manner such as to ask if it is in order that (some named matter) be placed in the official record while knowing that by asking it will be, or asking if (some Minister) has informed the Speaker of an intention to make a statement on (some named topic) to the House as a way to record the request in the official record); the decisions may not be appealed. The speaker bases decisions on the rules of the House and on precedent; if necessary, they may consult with the Parliamentary Clerks before issuing a ruling. In addition, the speaker has other powers that may be used to maintain orderly debate. Usually, the speaker attempts to end a disruption, or &quot;calls members to order&quot;, by loudly repeating &quot;ORDER! ORDER!&quot;. If members do not follow instructions, the speaker may punish them by demanding that they leave the House for the remainder of the day&#x27;s sitting. For grave disobedience, the speaker may &quot;name&quot; a member, by saying &quot;I name [Mr/Mrs X] …,&quot; (deliberately breaching the convention that members are only referred to by reference to their constituency) &quot;…the [Right] Honourable Member for [Y]&quot;. The House may then vote to suspend the member &quot;named&quot; by the speaker, for five sitting days for a first offence. In case of &quot;grave disorder&quot;, the speaker may immediately adjourn the entire sitting. This power has been invoked on several occasions since it was conferred in 1902.

In addition to maintaining discipline, the speakers must ensure that debate proceeds smoothly. If they find that a member is making irrelevant remarks, is tediously repetitive, or is otherwise attempting to delay proceedings, they may order the member to end the speech.

Before a debate begins in which &quot;many members have expressed a wish to speak&quot; or in which allotted Parliamentary time is short, the speaker may ask honourable members for (in reality demand) short speeches, and set a time limit. At the same time, however, the speaker is charged with protecting the interests of the minority by ensuring sufficient debate before a vote. Thus, the speaker may disallow a closure, which seeks to end debate and immediately put the question to a vote, if the speaker finds that the motion constitutes an abuse of the rules or breaches the rights of the minority.

The speaker selects which tabled amendments are selected for votes. Before the members of the House vote on any issue, the speaker &quot;puts the question&quot;; that is, they orally state the motion on which the members are to vote, and the members present say &quot;aye&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. If this voice vote indicates a clear majority the result will usually be accepted, but if the acclamation is unclear or any member demands it, a division (vote in the aye and noe lobbies in which members&#x27; names are taken) takes place; the speaker and deputy speakers do not vote. The speaker may overrule a request for a division and maintain the original ruling; this power, however, is used only rarely, usually when members make frivolous requests for a division to delay proceedings.

===Casting votes===

When the Ayes and Noes are tied, the speaker must use the casting vote. By convention the casting vote is issued in accordance with the constitutional convention known as Speaker Denison&#x27;s rule, rather than in line with the speaker&#x27;s personal opinion in the matter. The principle is always to vote in favour of further debate, or, where it has been previously decided to have no further debate or in some specific instances, to vote in favour of the status quo. For example, the speaker would vote against a closure motion, or the final passage of a bill, or an amendment.

Since the House of Commons has over 600 members, tied votes are very uncommon and speakers are rarely called upon to use the casting vote. Since 1801, there have been only 50 instances of tied divisions. A casting vote by a Speaker was cast on 3 April 2019, the first since 1993, against an amendment to the Business of the House Motion. Speaker Bercow affirmed the precedent that it was not the role of the chair to create a majority that did not otherwise exist for action.

===Other functions===
In addition to the role of presiding officer, the speaker performs several other functions on behalf of the House of Commons.
* The speaker represents the body in relations with the Sovereign, the House of Lords, and non-parliamentary bodies. On important occasions of state (such as Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 2002), the speaker presents Addresses to the Crown on behalf of the House.
* The speaker performs various procedural functions such as deciding whether to recall the House from recess during a national emergency, when requested by the Government.
* When vacancies arise, the speaker authorises the issuance of writs of election.
* Furthermore, the speaker is responsible for certifying bills that relate solely to national taxation as &quot;money bills&quot; under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949. The House of Lords has no power to block or substantially delay a money bill; even if the Lords fail to pass the bill, it becomes law within a month of passage by the Commons. The speaker&#x27;s decision on the matter is final, and cannot be challenged by the Upper House.
* Before 2021, under the former English votes for English laws procedures, the speaker certified which bills or parts of bills related to England or England &amp; Wales only.

The speaker is also responsible for overseeing the administration of the House. The speaker chairs the House of Commons Commission, a body that appoints staff, determines their salaries, and supervises the general administration of those who serve the House. Furthermore, the speaker controls the parts of the Palace of Westminster used by the House of Commons. The speaker chairs the Speaker&#x27;s Committee for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (SCIPSA) and the Speaker&#x27;s Committee on the Electoral Commission (SCEC). Also, the speaker is the &quot;ex officio&quot; Chairman of the four boundary commissions (for England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland), which are charged with redrawing the boundaries of parliamentary constituencies to reflect population changes. However, the speaker normally does not attend meetings of the boundary commissions; instead, the Deputy Chairman of the commission (usually a judge) normally presides.

The speaker appoints MPs to serve on the Ecclesiastical Committee.

When John Bercow was Speaker, he ran a series of lectures called Speaker&#x27;s Lectures.

Finally, the speaker continues to represent his or her constituency in Parliament. Like any other Member of Parliament, the speaker deals with issues raised by constituents and attempts to address their concerns.

==Deputies==
The speaker is helped by three deputies elected by the House (addressed &quot;Mr/Madam Deputy Speaker&quot;). The most senior has an alternative style &quot;Chairman of Ways and Means&quot;; the title derives from the defunct Ways and Means Committee which could amend and expedite bills to tax. The others can be called the second or third deputy speakers but are formally in the House named the First and Second Deputy Chairmen of Ways and Means (this resembles the &quot;Junior Lords of the Treasury&quot; being the government chief whips). Typically the speaker presides for three hours each day; otherwise a deputy takes the Chair. During the annual Budget, which the Chancellor of the Exchequer reads out in outline, the Chairman of Ways and Means presides.

The speaker never presides over the Committee of the Whole House, which consists of all the members, but operates under more flexible rules of debate. This device was used so that members could debate independently of the speaker, who they suspected acted as an agent or spy of the monarch. Now the procedure is invoked to have a less procedurally strict debate.

Deputies have the same powers as the speaker when presiding and in deadlock are bound by constitutional precedent to follow Speaker Denison&#x27;s rule. They do not take part in partisan politics and remain completely impartial in the House. They are entitled to take a full part in constituency politics including raising of questions, often written, of ministers. In general elections, they stand as party politicians.

==Precedence, salary, residence and privileges==
The speaker is one of the highest-ranking officials in the United Kingdom. By an Order in Council issued in 1919, the speaker ranks in the order of precedence above all non-royal individuals except the Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor, and the Lord President of the Council. In England and Wales, he also ranks below the two archbishops of the Church of England; in Scotland, he also ranks below the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland; and in Northern Ireland, he also ranks below the Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic archbishops of Armagh, and the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church.

In 1789 Henry Addington received £6,000 as his salary as Speaker ().

In 2010, the speaker received a salary of £145,492, equal to that of a Cabinet Minister. Speaker&#x27;s House, the official residence, is at the northeast corner of the Palace of Westminster and is used for official functions and meetings, with private accommodation in a four-bedroom apartment upstairs. Each day, prior to the sitting of the House of Commons, the speaker and other officials travel in procession from the apartments to the Chamber. The procession includes the Doorkeeper, the Serjeant-at-arms, the speaker, a trainbearer, the Chaplain, and the Speaker&#x27;s Private Secretary. The Serjeant-at-Arms attends the speaker on other occasions, and in the House; they bear a ceremonial mace that symbolises the royal authority under which the House meets, as well as the authority of the House of Commons itself.

Speakers, according with their high order of precedence, are appointed to the Privy Council on election. Thus they keep entitlement to the style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; and postnominal letters . On retirement most were since the Wars of the Three Kingdoms elevated to the House of Lords as viscounts. The last ennobled as a viscount was George Thomas in 1983. Since then, the custom has been for the Government to offer life peerages (life baronies) to those retiring. Division on John Bercow&#x27;s legacy led to this precedent being broken for the first time in over two centuries when he was not nominated to the House of Lords by the Government.

===Speaker&#x27;s Chaplain===

Chaplain to the speaker was traditionally a canon residentiary of Westminster Abbey; from 1990–2010 the post was held by that canon who is Rector of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster (the parish church between Parliament and the Abbey). Under Speaker Bercow for 2010–2019, Rose Hudson-Wilkin, then serving as Vicar of Dalston and Haggerston, was appointed Speaker&#x27;s Chaplain, the first chaplain appointed not to be a canon of the Abbey. The Speaker&#x27;s Chaplain commences daily proceedings by leading prayers and also conducts marriages of Members when they are carried out in the crypt chapel of the Palace of Westminster.

=== Speaker&#x27;s Counsel ===

The Speaker&#x27;s Counsel is the speaker&#x27;s legal adviser.

==Official dress==
On normal sitting days, the speaker wears a black silk lay-type gown (similar to a King&#x27;s Counsel&#x27;s gown) with a train and a mourning rosette (also known as a &#x27;wig bag&#x27;) over the flap collar at the back.

On state occasions (such as the Opening of Parliament), the speaker wears a robe of black satin damask trimmed with gold lace and frogs and, in the past, a full-bottomed wig and tricorne hat.

The previous speaker, John Bercow, no longer wore the traditional court dress outfit, which included knee breeches, silk stockings and buckled court shoes under the gown, or the wig. Betty Boothroyd first decided not to wear the wig and Michael Martin chose not to wear knee breeches, silk stockings or the traditional buckled shoes, preferring flannel trousers and Oxford shoes. Bercow chose not to wear court dress altogether in favour of a lounge suit, as he felt uncomfortable in court dress (he wore morning dress under the State Robe at State Openings). As seen at the 2015 State Opening of Parliament, Bercow further toned down the state robe by removing the gold frogging on the sleeves and train, so that it now resembles a pro-chancellor&#x27;s robe at certain universities. However, he returned to wearing the traditional robe in 2016. The new speaker elected in November 2019, Lindsay Hoyle, wears a gown like Bercow, but continues to wear his parliamentary identification card on a lanyard, as he did while Deputy Speaker. He later said he would wear the full court dress on ceremonial occasions, which he first did at the State Opening on 19 December 2019, with lanyard included, albeit without the wig, which is still stored under the bed of former Speaker Bernard Weatherill’s daughter-in-law. Following the death of Elizabeth II, Speaker Hoyle briefly returned to wearing court dress before returning to a regular business suit when the mourning period ended. Beginning with the 59th session of Parliament in 2024, Speaker Hoyle began wearing pre-Martin court dress regularly.

<text>Cakewalk, Inc. is a former music production software company based in Boston, Massachusetts and currently a brand of Singaporean music company BandLab Technologies. The company&#x27;s best known product was their professional-level digital audio workstation (DAW) software, SONAR. SONAR integrated multi-track recording and editing of digital audio and MIDI. The company also offered a full range of music software products, including Pyro Audio Creator—a digital music management program, and Dimension Pro—a virtual instrument.

The brand was acquired in 2013 by Gibson, and in 2017 Gibson announced it was ceasing Cakewalk development. In 2018, Singapore-based BandLab Technologies purchased some of Cakewalk, Inc.&#x27;s assets, and continued SONAR development as part of its portfolio of freeware digital audio workstation software.

== History ==
Greg Hendershott founded the company in 1987 as &quot;Twelve Tone Systems, Inc.&quot;, and was its CEO until July 1, 2012. The firm soon found that most customers referred to it by the name of its initial product, a MIDI music sequencer that Hendershott had named &quot;Cakewalk&quot;. To avoid confusion, the company operated for many years as &quot;Twelve Tone Systems, Inc. DBA Cakewalk&quot;.

The company released the original MIDI music sequencer product, &quot;Cakewalk&quot;, for MS-DOS in 1987. In 1991, they released a version for Windows 3.0.

Early &quot;Cakewalk&quot; for DOS versions (up to 3.0) required the intelligent mode of the MPU-401, and so could not be used with product clones of the MPU-401, while later Cakewalk versions (since 4.0) relied on the &quot;dumb&quot; UART mode only. With the addition of more features, the company renamed the sequencer &quot;Cakewalk Pro,&quot; and then &quot;Cakewalk Pro Audio&quot; when it gained support for digitized audio.

The SONAR digital audio workstation provided users the ability to create projects in which they could edit digital audio tracks, MIDI tracks, and associated information like lyrics and music notation. SONAR&#x27;s visual displays included audio waveforms, musical scores, editing consoles, and event lists. The user could mix MIDI output and audio tracks down to a stereo .WAV file and burn it to a CD or publish it in other media formats.

In January 2008, the logo on the company&#x27;s products changed to &quot;Cakewalk by Roland&quot; to reflect Roland Corporation&#x27;s purchase of a majority interest in the company.

In September 2008, the company officially changed its corporate name to &#x27;Cakewalk, Inc.&#x27;

Effective July 1, 2012, Greg Hendershott resigned as CEO, after 25 years with the company. Michael Hoover, previously Executive Vice President of Products, became President of Cakewalk, Inc.

On December 6, 2013, Roland sold all of its shares of Cakewalk to Gibson Brands. For the next 4 years, Cakewalk continued to operate in Boston, developing products for the Cakewalk brand, along with joint products with TASCAM.

On November 17, 2017, Gibson announced that it was ceasing active development and production of Cakewalk branded products. After 30 years, Cakewalk, Inc. ceased operation, with only the company&#x27;s web forum and license authorization servers still being kept functional.

On February 23, 2018, Singapore-based BandLab Technologies announced its purchase of some of Cakewalk, Inc.’s assets and all of its intellectual property. BandLab&#x27;s stated goal was continued development of the former company&#x27;s flagship product, SONAR (now renamed Cakewalk by BandLab) as part of its portfolio of freeware digital audio workstation software.

== Products ==
The company&#x27;s products included sequencers; digital audio workstations, including the current Cakewalk by Bandlab, and former products Dimension Pro and Rapture Pro (Multisample synth); and instruments, effects tools and miscellaneous consumer products for creating music.

<text>It&#x27;s Been a Good Life (2002) is a book edited by Janet Jeppson Asimov. The book, published by Prometheus Books (), is a collection of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s diaries, personal letters, and a condensation of his three earlier autobiographies:
* &quot;In Memory Yet Green&quot;, (1979, Doubleday)
* &quot;In Joy Still Felt&quot;, (1980, Doubleday)
* &quot;I. Asimov: A Memoir&quot;, (1994, Doubleday)

Janet Jeppson Asimov&#x27;s primary role was in choosing the entries and occasionally editing them so the reader would know the people of whom he was speaking. In one case, her edited version is less explicit than Isaac&#x27;s original, where Isaac and &quot;a famous man&quot; debate anti-Semitism (chapter 23 of the book). The famous man voices opposition to scientists since some had aided the Holocaust, and Isaac replies that this is exactly the same as condemning the Jews for crucifying Jesus. The edited version omits the celebrity&#x27;s name—Elie Wiesel.

In this book Janet Asimov revealed for the first time that Isaac had died of AIDS as a result of contracting the HIV virus through a blood transfusion he had received in 1983. This had been kept a secret at the time – April 1992 – because of widespread prejudice against AIDS patients.

The title &quot;it&#x27;s been a good life&quot; is a quote from the concluding page of &quot;Asimov Laughs Again&quot; (1991), one of his last works.

<text>Laurence Edward Alan Lee, (26 June 1914 – 13 May 1997) was an English poet, novelist and screenwriter, who was brought up in the small village of Slad in Gloucestershire.

His most notable work is the autobiographical trilogy &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot; (1959), &quot;As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning&quot; (1969), and &quot;A Moment of War&quot; (1991). The first volume recounts his childhood in the Slad Valley. The second deals with his leaving home for London and his first visit to Spain in 1935, and the third with his return to Spain in December 1937 to join the Republican International Brigades.

==Early life and works==

Lee was born in Stroud, Gloucestershire on 26 June 1914, son of civil servant Reginald Joseph Lee (1877-1947) and Annie Emily (1879-1950), née Light, and moved with his family to the village of Slad in 1917; this relocation opens Lee&#x27;s novel &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot;. After fighting in the First World War with the Royal West Kent Regiment, Lee&#x27;s father did not return to the family. Lee and his brothers grew up close with their mother&#x27;s family, but intensely disliking their Lee relations. His sister, Frances, died in 1915 aged three when Lee was a toddler. He had two full brothers, Jack and Tony, and five older half-siblings from his father&#x27;s first marriage. His brother Jack (1913-2002) was to become a film director; although close when younger, they would fall out in later life, being &quot;on non-speaking terms for 25 years&quot;.

At 12, Lee went to the Central Boys&#x27; School in Stroud. In his notebook for 1928, when he was 14, he listed &quot;Concert and Dance Appointments&quot;, for at this time he was in demand to play his violin at dances.

Lee left the Central School at 15 to become an errand boy at a Chartered Accountants in Stroud. In 1931, he first found the Whiteway Colony, two miles from Slad, a colony founded by Tolstoyan anarchists. This gave him his first smattering of politicisation and was where he met the composer Benjamin Frankel and the &quot;Cleo&quot; who appears in &quot;As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning&quot;. In 1933 he met Sophia Rogers, an &quot;exotically pretty girl with dark curly hair&quot; who had moved to Slad from Buenos Aires, an influence on Lee who said later in life that he only went to Spain because &quot;a girl in Slad from Buenos Aires taught me a few words of Spanish.&quot;

At 20 Lee worked as an office clerk and a builder&#x27;s labourer, and lived in London for a year before leaving for Vigo, in northwest Spain, in the summer of 1935. From there he travelled across Spain as far as Almuñecar on the coast of Andalusia. Walking more often than not, he eked out a living by playing his violin. His first encounter with Spain is the subject of &quot;As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning&quot; (1969). During this period he met a woman, Wilma Gregory, who supported him financially, and also met Mary Garman and Roy Campbell. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 Lee was picked up by HMS &quot;Blanche&quot;, a British destroyer from Gibraltar that was collecting marooned British subjects on the southern Spanish coast.

Lee started to study for an art degree but returned to Spain in 1937 as an International Brigade volunteer. His service in the Brigade was cut short by his epilepsy. These experiences were recounted in &quot;A Moment of War&quot; (1991), an austere memoir of his time as a volunteer in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). According to many biographical sources, Lee fought in the Republican army against Franco&#x27;s Nationalists. After his death there were claims that Lee&#x27;s involvement in the war was a fantasy; the claims were dismissed as &quot;ludicrous&quot; by his widow.

Lee met Mary Garman&#x27;s married sister, Lorna Wishart, in Cornwall in 1937, and they had an affair lasting until she left him for Lucian Freud in 1943. They had a daughter, Yasmin David, together. Wishart&#x27;s husband Ernest agreed to raise the girl as his own; she later became an artist.

Before 1951 Lee worked primarily as a journalist and as a scriptwriter. During the Second World War he made documentary films for the GPO Film Unit (1939–40) and the Crown Film Unit (1941–1943). From 1944 to 1946 he worked as the Publications Editor for the Ministry of Information. In 1950 Lee married Catherine Francesca Polge, whose father was Provençal and whose mother was another of the Garman sisters, Helen; they had one daughter, Jessie. From 1950 to 1951 he was caption-writer-in-chief for the Festival of Britain, for which service he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1952.

The success of the autobiographical novel &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot; in 1959 allowed Lee to become a full-time independent writer. It continues to be one of the UK&#x27;s most popular books, and is often used as a set English literature text for schoolchildren. The work depicts the hardships, pleasures and simplicity of rural life in the time of Lee&#x27;s youth; readers continue to find the author&#x27;s portrayal of his early life vivid and evocative. Lee said that the creation of the book took him two years, and that it was written three times. With the proceeds Lee was able to buy a cottage in Slad, the village of his childhood.

==Poetry==
Lee&#x27;s first love was always poetry, though he was only moderately successful as a poet. Lee&#x27;s poems had appeared in the &quot;Gloucester Citizen&quot; and the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot;, and in October 1934 his poem &#x27;Life&#x27; won a prize from, and publication in, the &quot;Sunday Referee&quot;, a national paper. Another poem was published in Cyril Connolly&#x27;s &quot;Horizon&quot; magazine in 1940 and his first volume of poems, &quot;The Sun My Monument,&quot; was published in 1944. This was followed by &quot;The Bloom of Candles&quot; (1947) and &quot;My Many-coated Man&quot; (1955). Several poems written in the early 1940s reflect the atmosphere of the war, but also capture the beauty of the English countryside. The poem &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; from &quot;My Many-coated Man&quot; was set for unaccompanied mixed choir by American composer Samuel Barber in 1968.

==Other works==
Other works include &quot;A Rose for Winter,&quot; about a trip he made to Andalusia 15 years after the civil war; &quot;Two Women&quot; (1983), a story of Lee&#x27;s courtship of and marriage to Kathy, daughter of Helen Garman; &quot;The Firstborn&quot; (1964), about the birth and childhood of their daughter Jessy (christened Jesse); and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stay Long&quot; (1975), a collection of occasional writing.

Lee also wrote travel books, essays, radio plays and short stories.
He wrote for British Transport Films &#x27;Journey into Spring&#x27;.

==Honours and awards==
Lee received several awards, including the Atlantic Award (a Canadian literary award (1944), the Society of Authors travelling award (1951), the William Foyle Poetry Prize (1956) and the W. H. Smith and Son Award (1960).

In &quot;As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning,&quot; Lee writes of his stay in Almuñécar, a Spanish fishing village which he calls &quot;Castillo&quot;. In 1988 the citizens of Almuñécar erected a statue in Lee&#x27;s honour.

In 1993, &quot;A Moment of War&quot; was chosen as a Notable Book of the Year by the editors of the New York Times Book Review.

Lee provided a great deal of valuable support to the Brotherhood of Ruralists in their attempts to establish themselves in the 1970s, and he continued to do so until his death; his essay &quot;Understanding the Ruralists&quot; opened the Brotherhood&#x27;s major 1993 retrospective book. Indeed, it was Lee who is said to have given them the name &quot;Ruralists.&quot;

In 2003 the British Library acquired Lee&#x27;s original manuscripts, letters and diaries. The collection includes two unknown plays and drafts of &quot;Cider with Rosie,&quot; which reveal that early titles for the book were &quot;Cider with Poppy,&quot; &quot;Cider with Daisy&quot; and &quot;The Abandoned Shade.&quot;

==Final years==

In the 1960s, Lee and his wife returned to Slad to live near his childhood home, where they remained for the rest of his life, though for many years he retained a flat in Chelsea, coming to London to work during the week and returning to Slad at weekends. Lee revealed on the BBC1 &quot;Wogan&quot; show in 1985 that he was frequently asked by children visiting Slad as part of their O-Level study of &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot; &quot;where Laurie Lee was buried&quot;, assuming that the author was dead.

An archive recording of Lee&#x27;s voice was used for the narration of the Carlton Television film &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot; (1998), which was first broadcast after his death. The screenplay was written by his friend John Mortimer.

Lee died of bowel cancer at home in Slad on 13 May 1997, at the age of 82. He is buried in the local churchyard.
