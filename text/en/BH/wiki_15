<text>Sir John Soane (; né Soan; 10 September 1753 – 20 January 1837) was an English architect who specialised in the Neo-Classical style. The son of a bricklayer, he rose to the top of his profession, becoming professor of architecture at the Royal Academy and an official architect to the Office of Works. He received a knighthood in 1831.

Soane&#x27;s best-known work was the Bank of England (his work there is largely destroyed), a building which had a widespread effect on commercial architecture. He also designed Dulwich Picture Gallery, which, with its top-lit galleries, was a major influence on the planning of subsequent art galleries and museums. His main legacy is Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in his former home and office, designed to display the art works and architectural artefacts that he collected during his lifetime. The museum is described in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Architecture&quot; as &quot;one of the most complex, intricate, and ingenious series of interiors ever conceived&quot;.

==Background and training==

Soane was born in Goring-on-Thames on 10 September 1753. He was the second surviving son of John Soan and his wife Martha. The &#x27;e&#x27; was added to the surname by the architect in 1784 on his marriage. His father was a builder or bricklayer, and died when Soane was fourteen in April 1768. He was educated in nearby Reading in a private school run by William Baker. After his father&#x27;s death Soane&#x27;s family moved to nearby Chertsey to live with Soane&#x27;s brother William, 12 years his elder.

William Soan introduced his brother to James Peacock, a surveyor who worked with George Dance the Younger. Soane began his training as an architect age 15 under George Dance the Younger and joining the architect at his home and office in the City of London at the corner of Moorfields and Chiswell Street. Dance was a founding member of the Royal Academy and doubtless encouraged Soane to join the schools there on 25 October 1771 as they were free. There he would have attended the architecture lectures delivered by Thomas Sandby and the lectures on perspective delivered by Samuel Wale.

Dance&#x27;s growing family was probably the reason that in 1772 Soane continued his education by joining the household and office of Henry Holland. He recalled later that he was &#x27;placed in the office of an eminent builder in extensive practice where I had every opportunity of surveying the progress of building in all its different varieties, and of attaining the knowledge of measuring and valuing artificers&#x27; work&#x27;. During his studies at the Royal Academy, he was awarded the academy&#x27;s silver medal on 10 December 1772 for a measured drawing of the façade of the Banqueting House, Whitehall, which was followed by the gold medal on 10 December 1776 for his design of a &quot;Triumphal Bridge&quot;. He received a travelling scholarship in December 1777 and exhibited at the Royal Academy a design for a Mausoleum for his friend and fellow student James King, who had drowned in 1776 on a boating trip to Greenwich. Soane, a non-swimmer, was going to be with the party but decided to stay home and work on his design for a &quot;Triumphal Bridge&quot;. By 1777, Soane was living in his own accommodation in Hamilton Street. In 1778 he published his first book &quot;Designs in Architecture&quot;. He sought advice from Sir William Chambers on what to study: &quot;Always see with your own eyes ... [you] must discover their true beauties, and the secrets by which they are produced.&quot; Using his travelling scholarship of £60 per annum for three years, plus an additional £30 travelling expenses for each leg of the journey, Soane set sail on his Grand Tour, his ultimate destination being Rome, at 5:00 am, 18 March 1778.

==Grand Tour==

His travelling companion was Robert Furze Brettingham; they travelled via Paris, where they visited Jean-Rodolphe Perronet, and then went on to the Palace of Versailles on 29 March. They finally reached Rome on 2 May 1778. Soane wrote home, &quot;my attention is entirely taken up in the seeing and examining the numerous and inestimable remains of Antiquity ...&quot;. His first dated drawing is 21 May of the church of Sant&#x27;Agnese fuori le mura (Saint Agnes Outside the Walls). His former classmate, the architect Thomas Hardwick, returned to Rome in June from Naples. Hardwick and Soane would produce a series of measured drawings and ground plans of Roman buildings together. During the summer they visited Hadrian&#x27;s Villa and the Temple of Vesta, Tivoli, whilst back in Rome they investigated the Colosseum. In August Soane was working on a design for a &quot;British Senate House&quot; to be submitted for the 1779 Royal Academy summer exhibition.

In the autumn he met the Bishop of Derry, Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol, who had built several grand properties for himself. The Earl presented copies of &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; and &quot;De architectura&quot; to Soane. In December the Earl introduced Soane to Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford, an acquaintance which would lead eventually to architectural commissions. The Earl persuaded Soane to accompany him to Naples, setting off from Rome on 22 December 1778. On the way they visited Capua and the Palace of Caserta, arriving in Naples on 29 December. It was there that Soane met two future clients, John Patteson and Richard Bosanquet. From Naples Soane made several excursions including to Pozzuoli, Cumae and Pompeii, where he met yet another future client, Philip Yorke. Soane also attended a performance at Teatro di San Carlo and climbed Mount Vesuvius. Visiting Paestum, Soane was deeply impressed by the Greek temples. Next he visited the Certosa di Padula, then went on to Eboli and Salerno and its cathedral. Later they visited Benevento and Herculaneum. The Earl and Soane left for Rome on 12 March 1779, travelling via Capua, Gaeta, the Pontine Marshes, Velletri, the Alban Hills and Lake Albano, and Castel Gandolfo. Back in Rome they visited the Palazzo Barberini and witnessed the celebrations of Holy Week. Shortly after, the Earl and his family departed for home, followed a few weeks later by Thomas Hardwick.

It was then that Soane met Maria Hadfield (they became lifelong friends) and Thomas Banks. Soane was now fairly fluent in the Italian language, a sign of his growing confidence. A party, including Thomas Bowdler, Rowland Burdon, John Patteson, John Stuart and Henry Grewold Lewis, decided to visit Sicily and paid for Soane to accompany them as a draughtsman. The party headed for Naples on 11 April, where on 21 April they caught a Swedish ship to Palermo. Soane visited the Villa Palagonia, which made a deep impact on him. Influenced by the account of the Villa in his copy of Patrick Brydone&#x27;s &quot;Tour through Sicily and Malta&quot;, Soane savoured the &quot;Prince of Palagonia&#x27;s Monsters ... nothing more than the most extravagant caricatures in stone&quot;, but more significantly seems to have been inspired by the Hall of Mirrors to introduce similar effects when he came to design the interiors of his own house in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. Leaving Palermo from where the party split, Stuart and Bowdler going off together. The rest headed for Segesta, Trapani, Selinunte and Agrigento, exposing Soane to Ancient Greek architecture. From Agrigento the party headed for Licata, where they sailed for Malta and Valletta returning on 2 June, to Syracuse, Sicily. Moving on to Catania and Palazzo Biscari then Mount Etna, Taormina, Messina and the Lepari Islands. They were back in Naples by 2 July where Soane purchased books and prints, visiting Sorrento before returning to Rome. Shortly after, John Patterson returned to England via Vienna, from where he sent Soane the first six volumes of &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman&quot;, delivered by Antonio Salieri.

In Rome Soane&#x27;s circle now included Henry Tresham, Thomas Jones and Nathaniel Marchant. Soane continued to study the buildings of Rome, including the Basilica of St. John Lateran. Soane and Rowland Burdon set out in August for Lombardy. Their journey included visits to Ancona, Rimini, Bologna, Parma and its Accademia, Milan, Verona, Vicenza and its buildings by Andrea Palladio, Padua, the Brenta (river) with its villas by Palladio, Venice. Then back to Bologna where Soane copied designs for completing the west front of San Petronio Basilica including ones by Palladio, Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola and Baldassare Peruzzi. Then to Florence and the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno of which he was later, in January 1780 elected a member; then returned to Rome.

Soane continued his study of buildings, including Villa Lante, Palazzo Farnese, Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne, the Capitoline Museums and the Villa Albani. That autumn he met Henry Bankes, Soane prepared plans for the Banke&#x27;s house Kingston Lacy, but these came to nothing. Early in 1780 Frederick Augustus Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol wrote to Soane offering him various architectural commissions, Soane decided to return to England and began to organise his return journey. He left Rome on 19 April 1780, travelling with the Reverend George Holgate and his pupil Michael Pepper. They visited the Villa Farnese, then on to Siena. Then Florence where they visited the Palazzo Pitti, Uffizi, Santo Spirito, Giotto&#x27;s Campanile and other sites.

Performing at the Teatro della Pergola was Nancy Storace with whom Soane formed a lifelong friendship. Their journey continued on via Bologna, Padua, Vicenza, Verona, Mantua where he sketched Palazzo del Te, Parma, Piacenza. Milan where he attended La Scala, the theatre was a growing interest, Lake Como from where they began their crossing of the Alps via the Splügen Pass. They then passed on to Zürich, Reichenau, Wettingen, Schaffhausen, Basel on the way to which the bottom of Soane&#x27;s trunk came loose on the coach and spilled the contents behind it, he thus lost many of his books, drawings, drawing instruments, clothes and his gold and silver medals from the Royal Academy (none of which was recovered). He continued his journey on to Freiburg im Breisgau, Cologne, Liège, Leuven and Brussels before embarking for England.

==Early projects ==
=== Struggle to establish architectural practice ===

He reached England in June 1780; thanks to his Grand Tour he was £120 in debt. After a brief stop in London, Soane headed for Frederick Augustus Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol&#x27;s estate at Ickworth House in Suffolk, where the Earl was planning to build a new house. But immediately the Earl changed his mind and dispatched Soane to Downhill House, in County Londonderry, Ireland, where Soane arrived on 27 July 1780. The Earl had grandiose plans to rebuild the house, but Soane and the Earl disagreed over the design and parted company, Soane receiving only £30 for his efforts. He left via Belfast sailing to Glasgow. From Glasgow he travelled to Allanbank, Scottish Borders, home of a family by the name of Stuart he had met in Rome, he prepared plans for a new mansion for the family, but again the commission came to nothing. In early December 1780 Soane took lodgings at 10 Cavendish Street, London. To pay his way his friends from the Grand Tour, Thomas Pitt and Philip Yorke, gave him commissions for repairs and minor alterations. Anna, Lady Miller, considered building a temple in her garden at Batheaston to Soane&#x27;s design and he hoped he might receive work from her circle of friends. But again this was not to be. To help him out, George Dance gave Soane a few measuring jobs, including one in May 1781 on his repairs to Newgate Prison of damage caused by the Gordon Riots.

To give Soane some respite, Thomas Pitt invited him to stay in 1781 at his Thamesside villa of Petersham Lodge, which Soane was commissioned to redecorate and repair. Also in 1781 Philip Yorke gave Soane commissions: at his home, Hamels Park in Hertfordshire, he designed a new entrance gate and lodges, followed by a new dairy and alterations to the house, and in London alterations and redecoration of 63 New Cavendish Street. Increasingly desperate for work Soane entered a competition in March 1782 to design a prison, but failed to win. Soane continued to get other minor design work in 1782.

==Architectural career and success==
From the mid-1780s on Soane would receive a steady stream of commissions until his semi-retirement in 1832.

===Early domestic works===
It was not until 1783 that Soane received his first commission for a new country house, Letton Hall in Norfolk. The house was a fairly modest villa but it was a sign that at last Soane&#x27;s career was taking off and led to other work in East Anglia: Saxlingham Rectory in 1784, Shotesham Hall in 1785, Tendring Hall in 1784–86, and the remodelling of Ryston Hall in 1787.
At this early stage in his career Soane was dependent on domestic work, including: Piercefield House (1784), now a ruin; the remodelling of Chillington Hall (1785); The Manor, Cricket St Thomas (1786); Bentley Priory (1788); the extension of the Roman Catholic Chapel at New Wardour Castle (1788). An important commission was alterations to William Pitt the Younger&#x27;s Holwood House in 1786, Soane had befriended William Pitt&#x27;s uncle Thomas on his grand tour. In 1787 Soane remodelled the interior of Fonthill Splendens (later replaced by Fonthill Abbey) for Thomas Beckford, adding a picture gallery lit by two domes and other work.
===Bank of England===

On 16 October 1788 he succeeded Sir Robert Taylor as architect and surveyor to the Bank of England. He would work at the bank for the next 45 years, resigning in 1833. Given Soane&#x27;s youth and relative inexperience, his appointment was down to the influence of William Pitt, who was then the Prime Minister and his friend from the Grand Tour, Richard Bosanquet whose brother was Samuel Bosanquet, Director and later Governor of the Bank of England. His salary was set at 5% of the cost of any building works at the Bank, paid every six months. Soane would virtually rebuild the entire bank, and vastly extend it. The five main banking halls were based on the same basic layout, starting with the Bank Stock Office of 1791–96, consists of a rectangular room, the centre with a large lantern light supported by piers and pendentives, then the four corners of the rectangle have low vaulted spaces, and in the centre of each side compartments rising to the height of the arches supporting the central lantern, the room is vaulted in brick and windows are iron framed to ensure the rooms are as fire proof as possible. 

His work at the bank was:
*Erection of Barracks for the Bank Guards and rooms for the Governor, officers and servants of the Bank (1790).
*Between 1789 and February 1791 Soane oversaw acquisition of land northwards along Princes Street.
*The erection of the outer wall along the newly acquired land (1791).
*Erection of the Bank Stock Office the first of his major interiors at the bank, with its fire proof brick vault (1791–96).
*The erection of The Four Percent Office (replacing Robert Taylor&#x27;s room) (1793).
*The erection of the Rotunda (replacing Robert Taylor&#x27;s rotunda) (1794).
*The erection of the Three Percent Consols Transfer Office (1797–99).
*Acquisition of more land to the north along Bartholomew Lane, Lothbury and Prince&#x27;s Street (1792).
*Erection of outer wall along the north-east corner of the site, including an entrance arch for carriage (1794–98).
*Erection of houses for the Chief Accountant and his deputy (1797).
*The erection of the Lothbury Court within the new gate, leading to the inner courtyard used to receive Bullion (1797–1800).
*Extension of the Bank to the north-west, the exterior wall was extended around the junction of Lothbury and Princes Street, forming the &#x27;Tivoli Corner&#x27; which is based on the Temple of Vesta, Tivoli that Soane had visited and much admired, halfway down Princes street he created the Doric Vestibule as a minor entrance to the building and within two new courtyards that were surrounded by the rooms he built in 1790 and new rooms including printing offices for banknotes, the £5 Note Office and new offices for the Accountants, the Bullion Office off the Lothbury Court (1800–1808).
*Rebuilding of the vestibule and entrance from Bartholmew Lane (1814–1818).
*The rebuilding of Robert Taylor&#x27;s 3 Percent Consols Transfer Office and 3 Percent Consols Warrant Office and completion of the exterior wall around the south-east and south-west boundaries including the main-entrance in the centre of Threadneedle Street (1818–1827).

In 1807 Soane designed New Bank Buildings on Princes Street for the Bank, consisting of a terrace of five mercantile residences, which were then leased to prominent city firms.

The Bank being Soane&#x27;s most famous work, Sir Herbert Baker&#x27;s rebuilding of the Bank, demolishing most of Soane&#x27;s earlier building was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as &quot;the greatest architectural crime, in the City of London, of the twentieth century&quot;. 
===Architects&#x27; Club===
A growing sign of Soane&#x27;s success was an invitation to become a member of the Architects&#x27; Club that was formed on 20 October 1791. Practically all the leading practitioners in London were members, and it combined a meeting to discuss professional matters, at 5:00 pm on the first Thursday of every month with a dinner. The four founders were Soane&#x27;s former teachers George Dance and Henry Holland with James Wyatt and Samuel Pepys Cockerell. Other original members included: Sir William Chambers, Thomas Sandby, Robert Adam, Matthew Brettingham the Younger, Thomas Hardwick and Robert Mylne. Members who later joined included Sir Robert Smirke and Sir Jeffrey Wyattville.

===Royal Hospital Chelsea===

On 20 January 1807 Soane was made clerk of works of Royal Hospital Chelsea. He held the post until his death thirty years later; it paid a salary of £200 per annum. His designs were: built 1810 a new infirmary (destroyed in 1941 during The Blitz), a new stable block and extended his own official residence in 1814; a new bakehouse in 1815; a new gardener&#x27;s house 1816, a new guard-house and Secretary&#x27;s Office with space for fifty staff 1818; a Smoking Room in 1829 and finally a garden shelter in 1834.

===Freemasons&#x27; Hall, London===

Soane, who was a UGLE Freemason, was employed to extend Freemasons&#x27; Hall, London in 1821 by building a new gallery; later in 1826 he prepared various plans for a new hall, but it was only built in 1828–31, including a council chamber, and smaller room next to it and a staircase leading to a kitchen and scullery in the basement. The building was demolished to make way for the current building.

===Official appointments===

In October 1791 Soane was appointed Clerk of Works with responsibility for St James&#x27;s Palace, Whitehall and The Palace of Westminster. Between 1795 and 1799 Soane was Deputy Surveyor of His Majesty&#x27;s Woods and Forest, on a salary of £200 per annum. James Wyatt&#x27;s death in 1813 led to Soane together with John Nash and Robert Smirke, being appointed official architect to the Office of Works in 1813, the appointment ended in 1832, at a salary of £500 per annum. As part of this position he was invited to advise the Parliamentary Commissioners on the building of new churches from 1818 onward. He was required to produce designs for churches to seat 2000 people for £12,000 or less though Soane thought the cost too low, of the three churches he designed for the Commission all were classical in style. The three churches were: St Peter&#x27;s Church, Walworth (1823–24), for £18,348; Holy Trinity Church, Marylebone (1826–27), for £24,708; St John on Bethnal Green (1826–28), for £15,999.

===Public buildings===
Soane designed several public buildings in London, including: National Debt Redemption Office (1817) demolished 1900; Insolvent Debtors Court (1823) demolished 1861; Privy Council and Board of Trade Offices, Whitehall (1823–24), remodelled by Sir Charles Barry, the building now houses the Cabinet Office; in a new departure for Soane he used the Italianate style for The New State Paper Office, (1829–30) demolished 1868 to make way for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office building.

His commissions in Ireland included: Dublin, Soane was commissioned by the Bank of Ireland to design a new headquarters for the triangular site on Westmoreland Street now occupied by the Westin Hotel. However, when the Irish Parliament was abolished in 1800, the Bank abandoned the project and instead bought the former Parliament Buildings. In 1808 he started work on the design of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, for which he refused to charge. Building work began on 3 July 1810 and was completed in 1814. The remodelling of the interior has left little of Soane&#x27;s work.

===Later domestic work===

Country homes for the landed gentry included: new rooms and remodelling of Wimpole Hall and garden buildings, (1790–94) for his friend Philip Yorke whom he met on his Grand Tour; remodelling of Baronscourt, County Tyrone, Ireland (1791);Tyringham Hall (1792–1820); and the remodelling of Aynhoe Park (1798).

In 1804, he remodelled Ramsey Abbey (none of his work there now survives); the remodelling of the south front of Port Eliot and new interiors (1804–06); the Gothic Library at Stowe House (1805–06); Moggerhanger House (1791–1809); for Marden Hill, Hertfordshire, Soane designed a new porch and entrance hall (1818); the remodelling of Wotton House after damage by fire (1820); a terrace of six houses above shops in Regent Street London (1820–21), demolished; and Pell Wall Hall (1822). Among Soane&#x27;s most notable works are the dining rooms of both Numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street (1824–26) for the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer respectively of Great Britain.

===Dulwich Picture Gallery===
In 1811, Soane was appointed as architect for Dulwich Picture Gallery, the first purpose-built public art gallery in Britain, to house the Dulwich collection, which had been held by art dealers Sir Francis Bourgeois and his partner Noel Desenfans. Bourgeois&#x27;s will stipulated that the Gallery should be designed by his friend John Soane to house the collection. Uniquely the building also incorporates a mausoleum containing the bodies of Francis Bourgeois, and Mr and Mrs Desenfans. The Dulwich Picture Gallery was completed in 1817. The five main galleries are lit by elongated roof lanterns.

===New Law Courts===

As an official architect of the Office of Works Soane was asked to design the New Law Courts at Westminster Hall, he began surveying the building on 12 July 1820. Soane was to extend the law courts along the west front of Westminster Hall providing accommodation for five courts: The Court of Exchequer, Chancery, Equity, King&#x27;s Bench and Common Pleas. The foundations were laid in October 1822 and the shell of the building completed by February 1824. Then Henry Bankes launched an attack on the design of the building, as a consequence Soane had to demolish the facade and set the building lines back several feet and redesign the building in a gothic style instead of the original classical design, Soane rarely designed gothic buildings. The building opened on 21 January 1825, and remained in use until the Royal Courts of Justice opened in 1882, after this the building was demolished in 1883 and the site left as lawn. All the court rooms displayed Soane&#x27;s typically complex lighting arrangements, being top lit by roof lanterns often concealed from direct view.

===Palace of Westminster===

In 1822 as an official architect of the Office of Works, Soane was asked to make alteration to the House of Lords at the Palace of Westminster. He added a curving gothic arcade with an entrance leading to a courtyard, a new Royal Gallery, main staircase and Ante-Room, all the interiors were in a grand neo-classical style, completed by January 1824. Later four new committee rooms, a new library for the House of Lords and for the House of Commons alterations to the Speaker of the House of Commons house, and new library, committee rooms, clerks&#x27; rooms and stores, all would be destroyed in the fire of 1834.
===Design for a Royal Palace===
One of Soane&#x27;s largest designs was for a new Royal Palace in London, a series of designs were produced c. 1820–30. The design was unusual in that the building was triangular, there were grand porticoes at each corner and in the middle of each side of the building, the centre of the building consisted of a low dome, with ranges of rooms leading to the entrances in each side of the building, creating three internal courtyards. As far as is known it is not related to an official commission and was merely a design exercise by Soane, indeed the various drawings he produced date over several years, he first produced a design for a Royal Palace while in Rome in 1779.

==Royal Academy==
The Royal Academy was at the very centre of Soane&#x27;s architectural career, in the sixty four years from 1772 to 1836 there were only five years, 1778 and 1788–91, in which he did not exhibit any designs there. Soane had received part of his architectural education at the academy and it had paid for his Grand Tour. On 2 November 1795 Soane was elected an Associate Royal Academician and on 10 February 1802 Soane was elected a full Royal Academician, his diploma work being a drawing of his design for a new House of Lords. There were only ever a maximum of forty Royal Academicians at any one time. Under the rules of the Academy Soane automatically became for one year a member of the council of the academy, this consisted of the president and eight other academicians.

After Thomas Sandby died in 1798, George Dance, Soane&#x27;s old teacher was appointed professor of architecture at the academy, but during his tenure of the post failed to deliver a single lecture. Naturally this caused dissatisfaction, and Soane began to manoeuver to obtain the post for himself. Eventually Soane succeeded in ousting Dance and became professor on 28 March 1806. Soane did not deliver his first lecture until 27 March 1809 and did not begin to deliver the full series of twelve lectures until January 1810. All went well until he reached his fourth lecture on 29 January 1810, in it he criticised several recent buildings in London, including George Dance&#x27;s Royal College of Surgeons of England and his former pupil Robert Smirke&#x27;s Covent Garden Theatre.

Royal Academicians Robert Smirke (painter) father of the architect and his friend Joseph Farington led a campaign against Soane, as a consequence the Royal Academy introduced a rule forbidding criticism of a living British artist in any lectures delivered there. Soane attempted to resist what he saw as interference and it was only under threat of dismissal that he finally amended his lecture and recommenced on 12 February 1813 the delivery of the first six lectures. The rift that all this caused between Soane and George Dance would only be healed in 1815 after the death of Mrs Soane.

The twelve lectures, they were treated as two separate courses of six lectures, were all extensively illustrated with over one thousand drawings and building plans, most of which were prepared by his pupils as part of their lessons. The lectures were:
*Lecture I – traced &#x27;architecture from its most early periods&#x27; and covered the origin of civil, military and naval architecture.
*Lecture II – outlined the Classical architecture of the ancient world continuing on from the first lecture.
*Lecture III – an analysis of the five Classical orders, their application and the use of Caryatids.
*Lecture IV – use of the classical orders structurally and decoratively and for commemorative monuments.
*Lecture V – the history of architecture from Constantine the Great and the Decline of the Roman Empire to the rise of Renaissance architecture, followed by a survey of British architecture from Inigo Jones to William Chambers (architect).
*Lecture VI – covered arches, bridges the theory and symbolism of architectural ornament.
*Lecture VII – appropriate character in architecture and the correct use of decoration.
*Lecture VIII – the distribution and planning of rooms and staircases.
*Lecture IX – the design of windows, doors, pilasters, roofs and chimney-shafts.
*Lecture X – landscape architecture and garden buildings.
*Lecture XI – a discussion of the architecture and planning of London contrasting it with Paris.
*Lecture XII – a discussion of construction methods and standards.

==Soane&#x27;s library==
Soane over the course of his career built up an extensive library of 7,783 volumes, this is still housed in the library he designed in his home, now a museum, of 13 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. The library covers a wide range of subjects: Greek and Roman classics, poetry, painting, sculpture, history, music, drama, philosophy, grammars, topographical works, encyclopaedias, runs of journals and contemporary novels.

Naturally architectural books account for a large part of the library, and were very important when he came to write his lectures for the Royal Academy. The main architectural books include: several editions of Vitruvius&#x27;s &quot;De architectura&quot;, including Latin, English, French and Italian editions, including the commentary on the work by Daniele Barbaro. Julien-David Le Roy&#x27;s &quot;Les Ruines des plus beaux monuments de la Grèce&quot;, Johann Joachim Winckelmann&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums&quot;, in its French translation bought in 1806 just before Soane was appointed to the professorship. Also Marc-Antoine Laugier&#x27;s &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;Architecture&quot;, and Jacques-François Blondel&#x27;s nine volumes of &quot;Cours d&#x27;architecture ou traité de la décoration, distribution et constructions des bâtiments contenant les leçons données en 1750, et les années suivantes&quot;.

Soane also acquired several illuminated manuscripts: a 13th-century English Vulgate Bible; a 15th-century Flemish copy of Josephus&#x27;s works; four books of hours, two Flemish of the 15th century and early 16th century, Dutch of the late 15th century and French 15th century; a French missal dated 1482; &quot;Le Livre des Cordonniers de Caen&quot;, French 15th century; and Marino Grimani&#x27;s commentary of the Epistle of St Paul to the Romans, the work of Giulio Clovio.

Other manuscripts include: Francesco di Giorgio&#x27;s mid-16th century &quot;Treatise of Architecture&quot;; Nicholas Stone&#x27;s two account books covering 1631–42, and his son&#x27;s (also Nicholas Stone) 1648 sketch book (France and Italy) and Henry Stone&#x27;s 1638 sketch book; Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne&#x27;s The Second Epistle; James Gibbs&#x27;s &quot;A few short cursory remarks on buildings in Rome&quot;; Joshua Reynolds&#x27;s two sketch books from Rome; and Torquato Tasso&#x27;s early manuscript of &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot;.

Incunabula in the library include: Cristoforo Landino&#x27;s &quot;Commentario sopra la Comedia di Dante&quot;, 1481; S. Brant &quot;Stultifera Navis&quot;, 1488; and Boethius&#x27;s &quot;De Philosophico Consolatu&quot;, 1501.

==Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum==
In 1792, Soane bought a house at 12 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, London. Later purchasing 13 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, he used the house as his home and library, but also entertained potential clients in the drawing room. The houses along with 14 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, is now Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum and is open to the public for free.

===Antiquities, medieval and non-western objects===
Between 1794 and 1824 Soane remodelled and extended the house into two neighbouring properties – partly to experiment with architectural ideas, and partly to house his growing collection of antiquities and architectural salvage. As his practice prospered, Soane was able to collect objects worthy of the British Museum, including the Sarcophagus of Seti I in 1824.

After the Seti sarcophagus arrived at his house in March 1825, Soane held a three-day party, to which 890 people were invited, the basement where the sarcophagus was housed was lit by over one hundred lamps and candelabra, refreshments were laid on and the exterior of the house was hung with lamps. Among the guests were the Prime Minister Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool, and his wife; Robert Peel, Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, J. M. W. Turner, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Charles Long, 1st Baron Farnborough, Benjamin Haydon as well as many foreign dignitaries.

He also bought Greek and Roman bronzes, cinerary urns, fragments of Roman mosaics, Greek vases many displayed above the bookcases in the library, Greek and Roman busts, heads from statues and fragments of sculpture and architectural decoration, examples of Roman glass. Medieval objects include: architectural fragments, tiles and stained glass. Soane acquired 18th century Chinese ceramics as well as Peruvian pottery. Soane also purchased four Indian ivory chairs and a table.
===Sculpture===
Francis Leggatt Chantrey carved a white marble bust of Soane. Soane acquired Sir Richard Westmacott&#x27;s plaster model for &quot;Nymph unclasping her Zone&quot; and the plaster model of John Flaxman&#x27;s memorial sculpture of William Pitt the Younger. Of the ancient sculptures, a miniature copy of the famous sculpture of Diana of Ephesus is one of the most important in the collection. After the death of his teacher Henry Holland, Soane bought part of his collection of ancient marble fragments of architectural decoration. He also acquired Plastercasts of famous antique sculptures.

===Paintings and drawings===

Soane&#x27;s paintings include four works by Canaletto and paintings by Hogarth: the eight canvases of the &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; and the four canvases of the &quot;Humours of an Election&quot;. Soane acquired three works by his friend J. M. W. Turner. Thomas Lawrence painted a three quarter length portrait of Soane that hangs over the Dining Room fireplace. Soane acquired 15 drawings by Giovanni Battista Piranesi. A sketch of Soane&#x27;s wife by Soane&#x27;s friend John Flaxman is framed and displayed in the museum.

===Architectural drawings and architectural models===
There are over 30,000 architectural drawings in the collection. Of Soane&#x27;s drawings of his own designs (many are by his assistants and pupils, most notably Joseph Gandy), there are 601 covering the Bank of England, 6,266 of his other works and 1,080 prepared for the Royal Academy lectures. There are an additional 423 Soane drawings in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Other architects with drawings in the collection are by Christopher Wren, there are 8,856 drawings by Robert Adam and James Adam, John Thorpes book of architecture, George Dance the Elder&#x27;s 293 and George Dance the younger&#x27;s 1,303, housed in a specially designed cabinet, Sir William Chambers, James Playfair, Matthew Brettingham, Thomas Sandby, etc. There are a large number of Italian drawings. Of the 252 architectural models in the collection, 118 are of Soane&#x27;s own buildings.

===Legal creation of the Museum===
In 1833, he obtained an Act of Parliament, sponsored by Joseph Hume to bequeath the house and collection to the British Nation to be made into a museum of architecture, now the Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum. George Soane, realising that if the museum was set up he would lose his inheritance, persuaded William Cobbett to try and stop the bill, but failed.

==Personal life==

===Marriage and children===
On 24 June 1781 Soane leased rooms on the first floor of 53 Margaret Street, Westminster, for £40 per annum. It was here he would live for the first few years of his married life and where all his children would be born. In July 1783 he bought a grey mare that he stabled nearby. On 10 January 1784 Soane took a Miss Elizabeth Smith to the theatre, then on 7 February she took tea with Soane and friends, and they began attending plays and concerts together regularly. She was the niece and ward of a London builder George Wyatt, whom Soane would have known as he rebuilt Newgate Prison. They married on 21 August 1784 at Christ Church, Southwark. He always called his wife Eliza, and she would become his confidante.

Their first child, John, was born on 29 April 1786. His second son, George, was born just before Christmas 1787 but the boy died just six months later. The third son, also called George, was born on 28 September 1789. Their final son, Henry, was born on 10 October 1790, but died the following year from whooping cough.

===Soane&#x27;s various houses===
On the death of George Wyatt in February 1790 the Soanes inherited money and property, including a house in Albion Place, Southwark, where Soane moved his office.

On 30 June 1792 Soane purchased 12 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields for £2100. He demolished the existing house and rebuilt it to his own design, the Soanes moving in on 18 January 1794. By 1800 Soane was rich enough to purchase Pitzhanger Manor Ealing as a country retreat, for £4,500 on 5 September 1800. Apart from a wing designed by George Dance, Soane demolished the house and rebuilt it to his own design and was occupied by 1804, Soane used the manor to entertain friends and used to go fishing in the local streams. The building was not only designed to showcase Soane&#x27;s work, but also as a pedagogical environment for his young son George, who Soane hoped would follow in his professional footsteps. Undeterred by his child&#x27;s reluctance, Soane only grew more dedicated to establishing a professional legacy and established a formalised program of architecture education when he purchased his house at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, in London.

In June 1808 Soane purchased 13 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields for £4,200, initially renting the house to its former owner and extending his office over the garden to the rear. On 17 July 1812 number 13 was demolished, the house was rebuilt and the Soanes moved in during October 1813. In 1823, Soane purchased 14 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, he demolished the house, building the Picture Room attached to No. 13 over the site of the stables, in March 1825 he rebuilt the house to externally match No. 12.

===Family problems===
Soane hoped that one or both of his sons would also become architects. His purchase of Pitzhanger Manor was partially an inducement to this end. But both sons became increasingly wayward in their attitude and behaviour, showing not the slightest interest in architecture. John was lazy and suffered from ill health, whereas George had an uncontrollable temper. As a consequence Soane decided to sell Pitzhanger in July 1810.

John was sent to Margate in 1811 to try to help his illness and it was here that he became involved with a woman called Maria Preston. Soane agreed reluctantly to John&#x27;s and Maria&#x27;s marriage on 6 June, on the agreement that her father would produce a dowry of £2000, which failed to happen. Meanwhile, George who had been studying law at Cambridge University developed a friendship with James Boaden. George developed a relationship with Boaden&#x27;s daughter Agnes and one month after his brother&#x27;s wedding married her on 5 July. He wrote to his mother &#x27;I have married Agnes to spite you and father&#x27;.

George Soane tried to extort money from his father in March 1814 by demanding £350 per annum, and claiming he would otherwise be forced to become an actor. Agnes gave birth to twins in September, one child died shortly after. By November her husband George Soane had been imprisoned for debt and fraud. In January 1815 Eliza paid her son&#x27;s debts and repaid the person he had defrauded to ensure his release from prison.

In 1815 an article was published in the &quot;Champion&quot; for 10 to 24 September entitled &quot;The Present Low State of the Arts in England and more particularly of Architecture&quot;. In the article Soane was singled out for personal attack; although anonymous it soon emerged that his son George had written the article. On 13 October, Mrs Soane wrote &#x27;Those are George&#x27;s doing. He has given me my death blow. I shall never be able to hold up my head again&#x27;. Soane&#x27;s wife died on 22 November 1815, she had been suffering from ill health for some time. His wife&#x27;s body was interred on 1 December in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church. He wrote in his diary for that day &#x27;The burial of all that is dear to me in this world, and all I wished to live for!&#x27; George and Agnes had another child, this time a son, Frederick (born 1815).

In 1816 Soane designed the tomb above the vault his wife was buried in. It is built from Carrara marble and Portland stone. The tomb avoids any Christian symbolism; the roof has a pine cone finial, the symbol in Ancient Egypt for regeneration, below which is carved a serpent swallowing its own tail, a symbol of eternity. There are also carvings of boys holding extinguished torches, symbols of death. The inscription is:

The design of the tomb was a direct influence on Giles Gilbert Scott&#x27;s design for the red telephone box. 

Soane&#x27;s elder son John died on 21 October 1823, and was also buried in the vault. Maria, Soane&#x27;s daughter-in-law, was now a widow with young children, including a son also called John, in need of support. Soane set up a trust fund of £10,000 to support the family.

Soane found out in 1824 that his son George was living in a ménage à trois with his wife and her sister by whom he had a child called George Manfred. Soane&#x27;s grandson Fred and his mother were both subjected to domestic violence by George Soane, including beatings, and in Agnes&#x27;s case being dragged by her hair from a room. Soane initially refused to help them while they remained living with his son, who was in debt. However, by February 1834 Soane relented and was paying Agnes £200 per annum, also paying for Fred&#x27;s education. In the hope that Fred would become an architect, after he left school, Soane placed him with architect John Tarring. In January 1835 Tarring asked Soane to remove Fred, who was staying out late often in the company of a Captain Westwood, a known homosexual. Maria, Soane&#x27;s daughter-in-law, lived until 1855 and is buried on the edge of the south roundel in Brompton Cemetery.

===Personal beliefs, travels and health===
On Monday 6 August 1810 Soane and his wife set off on a thirteen-day tour of England and Wales. They normally rose at five or six in the morning and would visit many towns and monuments a day. Starting in Oxford they visited New College, Oxford, Merton College, Oxford, Blenheim Palace and Woodstock, Oxfordshire, where they stayed the night. Next day they went to Stratford-upon-Avon and Shakespeare&#x27;s Birthplace, Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon, to visit Shakespeare&#x27;s tomb, Kenilworth Castle, Warwick Castle, Whitley Abbey, Coventry and on to Lichfield. They next travelled to Liverpool, staying for four nights at the Liverpool Arms near Liverpool Town Hall. They attended a performance of &quot;Othello&quot;, with George Frederick Cooke as Iago. Among the people they visited was Soane&#x27;s former assistant Joseph Gandy, then living in the city. Their son John was living and studying with Gandy, in a failed attempt to become an architect. They visited John Foster (architect). Leaving Liverpool on Saturday 11 August, they crossed the River Mersey to the Wirral Peninsula and on to Chester where they saw the Rows and greatly admired Thomas Harrison&#x27;s work at Chester Castle. From Chester they visited Wrexham, and Ellesmere, Shropshire. On Sunday they moved on to Shrewsbury, visiting architect George Steuart&#x27;s St Chad&#x27;s Church.

On Monday 13 August they headed for Coalbrookdale, with The Iron Bridge then on to Buildwas Abbey. The journey continued down the River Severn to Bridgnorth then Ludlow and Ludlow Castle, and Leominster. On Wednesday 15 August, they were in Hereford, where they visited Hereford Cathedral and the gaol designed by his friend John Nash. Continuing on they reached Ross-on-Wye, from where they journeyed down the River Wye stopping at Tintern Abbey, glimpsed Piercefield House – one of Soane&#x27;s designs – and arrived in Chepstow, before moving on to Gloucester Cathedral and Gloucester where they spent the night. The next day they headed for Cheltenham, returning through the Cotswolds, visiting Northleach and Witney, where they spent their last night on the tour. Next day they travelled via High Wycombe and Uxbridge, on to their home at Pitzhanger Manor in Ealing for a day of angling. They returned at nine o&#x27;clock at night on Monday, 17 August, to their home in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields.

Soane was initiated on 1 December 1813 as a freemason under the newly established United Grand Lodge of England. By 1828 he had been given notable responsibilities for the fabric of Freemasons&#x27; Hall, and had been appointed as a Grand Officer of UGLE, with the rank of Grand Superintendent of Works. A portrait depicting Soane in the regalia of this rank hangs in the collection at Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum, London.

Soane did not like organised religion and was a Deist. Soane was influenced by the ideas that belonged to the enlightenment, and had read Voltaire&#x27;s and Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s works. He was taken ill on 27 December 1813 and was incapacitated until 28 March 1814, when he underwent an operation by Astley Cooper on his bladder to remove a fistula. For the first time since his Grand Tour Soane decided to travel abroad, he set off on 15 August 1815 for Paris returning on 5 September. In the summer of 1816, a friend, Barbara Hofland, persuaded him to take a holiday in Harrogate, there they visited Knaresborough, Plompton and its rocks, Ripon, Newby Hall, Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal Park, Castle Howard, Harewood House and Masham.

Soane visited Paris again in 1819, setting off on 21 August, he travelled via Dunkirk, Abbeville and Beauvais arriving in Paris. He stayed at 10 rue Vivienne, over the following days he visited, the Pont de Neuilly, Les Invalides, Palais du Roi de Rome, Père Lachaise Cemetery, Étienne-Louis Boullée&#x27;s chapel at Sainte-Roche, the Arc de Triomphe, Vincennes and the Château de Vincennes, Sèvres, Saint-Cloud, Arcueil with its ancient Roman aqueduct, Basilica of St Denis, Chamber of Deputies of France, Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, Musée du Louvre, Luxembourg Palace, Palace of Versailles with the Grand Trianon and Petit Trianon with its Hameau de la reine, Halle aux blés, Halle aux vins, Jardin des Plantes, Bassin de la Villette with its Rotonde de la Villette by Claude Nicolas Ledoux, Tuileries Palace, Château de Malmaison, he failed to gain admission to the Château de Bagatelle, he travelled home via Amiens and Amiens Cathedral, Abbeville, stopping off to visit Canterbury and Canterbury Cathedral.

On 24 December 1825 Soane underwent an operation to have a cataract removed from his eye.

In 1835 Soane had this to say: &quot;Devoted to Architecture from my childhood, I have through my life pursued it with the enthusiasm of a passion.&quot;

===Friends===

Soane counted many members of the Royal Academy as friends, including J. M. W. Turner, with whom he spent the Christmas after his wife&#x27;s death; Soane also owned three works by the artist. John Flaxman, professor of sculpture at the Royal Academy, was an old friend and Soane also acquired several plaster-casts of Flaxman&#x27;s work for his museum. Soane also counted Thomas Banks as a friend (and owned sculptures by him), and Thomas Lawrence, who painted Soane&#x27;s portrait. Despite the professional falling-out with his old master, George Dance the Younger, they remained firm friends. After Dance&#x27;s death Soane purchased his drawings. After the death of his other teacher, Henry Holland, Soane tried to buy his drawings and papers, but found they had been destroyed; he did however purchase some of his antique sculptures. Despite being professional rivals, Soane got on with fellow architect John Nash; they often dined together. Soane called on William Thomas Beckford both in London and when he was taking the waters in Bath in 1829. Soane had other friends including James Perry, Thomas Leverton Donaldson, Barbara Hofland and Rowland Burdon, whose friendship was formed while on the Grand Tour.

===Death and funeral===

Soane died a widower, estranged from his surviving son, George, whom he felt had betrayed him, having contributed to his wife&#x27;s death. Having caught a chill, Soane died in 13 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields at half past three on Friday 20 January 1837. His obituary appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; on Monday 23 January. Following a private funeral service, at his own request &#x27;plain without ostentation or parade&#x27;, he was buried in the same vault as his wife and elder son.

Within days of his father&#x27;s death George Soane, left an annuity of £52 per annum, challenged Soane&#x27;s will. Soane stated that he was left so little because &#x27;his general misconduct and constant opposition to my wishes evinced in the general tenor of his life&#x27;. To his daughter-in-law Agnes he left £40 per annum &#x27;not to be subject to the debts or control of her said husband&#x27;. The grounds for overthrowing the will were that his father was insane. On 1 August 1837 the judge at the Prerogative court rejected the challenge. George appealed but on 26 November dropped his suit.

==Pupils and assistants==
From 1784 Soane took a new pupil on roughly ever other year, these were: J. Adams, George Bailey, George Basevi, S. Burchell, H. Burgess, J. Buxton, Robert Dennis Chantrell, Thomas Chawner, F. Copland, E. Davis, E. Foxall, J.H. Good, Thomas Jeans, David Laing, Thomas Lee, C. Malton, John McDonnell, Arthur Patrick Mee, Frederick Meyer, David Mocatta, Henry Parke, Charles Edward Ernest Papendiek, David Richardson, W.E. Rolfe, John Sanders (his first pupil, taken on 1 September 1784), Henry Hake Seward, Thomas Sword, B.J. Storace, Charles Tyrrell and Thomas Williams. His most famous and successful pupil was Sir Robert Smirke (who, as a consequence of a personality contradictory to that of Soane, stayed less than a year).

Among the more renowned architects who attended Soane&#x27;s lectures at the Royal Academy, but weren&#x27;t actually articled to him as a student was Decimus Burton, who was one of the most famous and most successful architects of the 19th century. Other successful architects who as students attended the lectures were James Pennethorne, George Gilbert Scott, Owen Jones and Henry Roberts.

Soane&#x27;s main assistants he employed at various times were: Joseph Gandy, who prepared many of the perspective drawings of Soane&#x27;s designs, Christopher Ebdon, J.W. Hiort, G.E. Ives, William Lodder, R. Morrison, D. Paton, George Allen Underwood and George Wightwick.

The office routine for both assistants and pupils was in summer to work from seven in the morning to seven at night Monday to Saturday and in winter eight to eight, often assistants and pupils would be sent out to supervise building work on site. Students would be given time off to study at the Royal Academy and for holidays. The Students&#x27; room at the museum still exists, it is a mezzanine at the rear of the building, lined with two long wooden benches with stools, surrounded by plaster casts of classical architectural details and lit by a long skylight. The students were trained in surveying, measuring, costing, superintendence and draftsmanship, normally a student stayed for five to seven years.

As an example Robert Dennis Chantrell&#x27;s indentures were signed on 14 January 1807 just after he was fourteen (a typical age to join the office), his apprenticeship was to last for seven years, at a cost of one hundred Guineas (early in Soane&#x27;s career he charged £50 and this grew to 175 guineas), Soane would provide &#x27;board, lodgings and wearing apparel&#x27;; Chantrell only arrived in the office on 15 June 1807. It was normal to serve a probationary period of a few weeks.

In 1788 Soane defined the professional responsibility of an architect:The business of the architect is to make the designs and estimates, to direct the works and to measure and value the different parts; he is the intermediate agent between the employer, whose honour and interest he is to study, and the mechanic, whose rights he is to defend. His situation implies great trust; he is responsible for the mistakes, negligences, and ignorances of those he employs; and above all, he is to take care that the workmen&#x27;s bills do not exceed his own estimates. If these are the duties of an architect, with what propriety can his situation and that of the builder, or the contractor be united?

==Soane&#x27;s published writings==
Soane published several books related to architecture and an autobiography:

<text>In mathematics, the modular group is the projective special linear group formula_1 of formula_2 matrices with integer coefficients and determinant formula_3, such that the matrices formula_4 and formula_5 are identified. The modular group acts on the upper-half of the complex plane by linear fractional transformations. The name &quot;modular group&quot; comes from the relation to moduli spaces, and not from modular arithmetic.

==Definition==
The modular group is the group of fractional linear transformations of the complex upper half-plane, which have the form

:formula_6

where formula_7 are integers, and formula_8. The group operation is function composition.

This group of transformations is isomorphic to the projective special linear group formula_1, which is the quotient of the 2-dimensional special linear group formula_10 by its center formula_11. In other words, formula_1 consists of all matrices

:formula_13

where formula_7 are integers, formula_8, and pairs of matrices formula_4 and formula_5 are considered to be identical. The group operation is usual matrix multiplication.

Some authors &quot;define&quot; the modular group to be formula_1, and still others define the modular group to be the larger group formula_10. 

Some mathematical relations require the consideration of the group formula_20 of matrices with determinant plus or minus one. (formula_21 is a subgroup of this group.) Similarly, formula_22 is the quotient group formula_23. 

Since all formula_2 matrices with determinant 1 are symplectic matrices, then formula_25, the symplectic group of formula_2 matrices.

=== Finding elements ===
To find an explicit matrix
:formula_27
in formula_21, begin with two coprime integers formula_29, and solve the determinant equation formula_30. 

For example, if formula_31 then the determinant equation reads
:formula_32
then taking formula_33 and formula_34 gives formula_35. Hence
:formula_36
is a matrix. Then, using the projection, these matrices define elements in formula_37.

==Number-theoretic properties==
The unit determinant of

:formula_13

implies that the fractions , , , are all irreducible, that is having no common factors (provided the denominators are non-zero, of course). More generally, if is an irreducible fraction, then

:formula_39

is also irreducible (again, provided the denominator be non-zero). Any pair of irreducible fractions can be connected in this way; that is, for any pair and of irreducible fractions, there exist elements

:formula_40

such that

:formula_41

Elements of the modular group provide a symmetry on the two-dimensional lattice. Let and be two complex numbers whose ratio is not real. Then the set of points

:formula_42

is a lattice of parallelograms on the plane. A different pair of vectors and will generate exactly the same lattice if and only if

:formula_43

for some matrix in . It is for this reason that doubly periodic functions, such as elliptic functions, possess a modular group symmetry.

The action of the modular group on the rational numbers can most easily be understood by envisioning a square grid, with grid point corresponding to the fraction (see Euclid&#x27;s orchard). An irreducible fraction is one that is &quot;visible&quot; from the origin; the action of the modular group on a fraction never takes a &quot;visible&quot; (irreducible) to a &quot;hidden&quot; (reducible) one, and vice versa.

Note that any member of the modular group maps the projectively extended real line one-to-one to itself, and furthermore bijectively maps the projectively extended rational line (the rationals with infinity) to itself, the irrationals to the irrationals, the transcendental numbers to the transcendental numbers, the non-real numbers to the non-real numbers, the upper half-plane to the upper half-plane, et cetera.

If and are two successive convergents of a continued fraction, then the matrix

:formula_44

belongs to . In particular, if for positive integers , , , with and then and will be neighbours in the Farey sequence of order . Important special cases of continued fraction convergents include the Fibonacci numbers and solutions to Pell&#x27;s equation. In both cases, the numbers can be arranged to form a semigroup subset of the modular group.

==Group-theoretic properties==

=== Presentation ===
The modular group can be shown to be generated by the two transformations

:formula_45

so that every element in the modular group can be represented (in a non-unique way) by the composition of powers of and . Geometrically, represents inversion in the unit circle followed by reflection with respect to the imaginary axis, while represents a unit translation to the right.

The generators and obey the relations and . It can be shown that these are a complete set of relations, so the modular group has the presentation:

:formula_46

This presentation describes the modular group as the rotational triangle group (infinity as there is no relation on ), and it thus maps onto all triangle groups by adding the relation , which occurs for instance in the congruence subgroup .

Using the generators and instead of and , this shows that the modular group is isomorphic to the free product of the cyclic groups and :

:formula_47

===Braid group===
The braid group is the universal central extension of the modular group, with these sitting as lattices inside the (topological) universal covering group . Further, the modular group has a trivial center, and thus the modular group is isomorphic to the quotient group of modulo its center; equivalently, to the group of inner automorphisms of .

The braid group in turn is isomorphic to the knot group of the trefoil knot.

===Quotients===
The quotients by congruence subgroups are of significant interest.

Other important quotients are the triangle groups, which correspond geometrically to descending to a cylinder, quotienting the coordinate modulo , as . is the group of icosahedral symmetry, and the triangle group (and associated tiling) is the cover for all Hurwitz surfaces.

=== Presenting as a matrix group ===
The group formula_48 can be generated by the two matrices

: formula_49

since

: formula_50

The projection formula_51 turns these matrices into generators of formula_52, with relations similar to the group presentation.

==Relationship to hyperbolic geometry==
The modular group is important because it forms a subgroup of the group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane. If we consider the upper half-plane model of hyperbolic plane geometry, then the group of all
orientation-preserving isometries of consists of all Möbius transformations of the form

:formula_53

where , , , are real numbers. In terms of projective coordinates, the group acts on the upper half-plane by projectivity:

:formula_54

This action is faithful. Since is a subgroup of , the modular group is a subgroup of the group of orientation-preserving isometries of .

===Tessellation of the hyperbolic plane===

The modular group acts on formula_55 as a discrete subgroup of formula_56, that is, for each in formula_55 we can find a neighbourhood of which does not contain any other element of the orbit of . This also means that we can construct fundamental domains, which (roughly) contain exactly one representative from the orbit of every in . (Care is needed on the boundary of the domain.)

There are many ways of constructing a fundamental domain, but a common choice is the region

:formula_58

bounded by the vertical lines and , and the circle . This region is a hyperbolic triangle. It has vertices at and , where the angle between its sides is , and a third vertex at infinity, where the angle between its sides is 0.

There is a strong connection between the modular group and elliptic curves. Each point formula_59 in the upper half-plane gives an elliptic curve, namely the quotient of formula_60 by the lattice generated by 1 and formula_59. 
Two points in the upper half-plane give isomorphic elliptic curves if and only if they are related by a transformation in the modular group. Thus, the quotient of the upper half-plane by the action of the modular group is the so-called moduli space of elliptic curves: a space whose points describe isomorphism classes of elliptic curves. This is often visualized as the fundamental domain described above, with some points on its boundary identified.

The modular group and its subgroups are also a source of interesting tilings of the hyperbolic plane. By transforming this fundamental domain in turn by each of the elements of the modular group, a regular tessellation of the hyperbolic plane by congruent hyperbolic triangles known as the V6.6.∞ Infinite-order triangular tiling is created. Note that each such triangle has one vertex either at infinity or on the real axis . 

This tiling can be extended to the Poincaré disk, where every hyperbolic triangle has one vertex on the boundary of the disk. The tiling of the Poincaré disk is given in a natural way by the -invariant, which is invariant under the modular group, and attains every complex number once in each triangle of these regions. 

This tessellation can be refined slightly, dividing each region into two halves (conventionally colored black and white), by adding an orientation-reversing map; the colors then correspond to orientation of the domain. Adding in and taking the right half of the region (where ) yields the usual tessellation. This tessellation first appears in print in , where it is credited to Richard Dedekind, in reference to .
The map of groups (from modular group to triangle group) can be visualized in terms of this tiling (yielding a tiling on the modular curve), as depicted in the video at right.

==Congruence subgroups==

Important subgroups of the modular group , called &quot;congruence subgroups&quot;, are given by imposing congruence relations on the associated matrices.

There is a natural homomorphism given by reducing the entries modulo . This induces a homomorphism on the modular group . The kernel of this homomorphism is called the principal congruence subgroup of level , denoted . We have the following short exact sequence:

:formula_62

Being the kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup of the modular group . The group is given as the set of all modular transformations

:formula_63

for which and .

It is easy to show that the trace of a matrix representing an element of cannot be −1, 0, or 1, so these subgroups are torsion-free groups. (There are other torsion-free subgroups.)

The principal congruence subgroup of level 2, , is also called the modular group . Since is isomorphic to , is a subgroup of index 6. The group consists of all modular transformations for which and are odd and and are even.

Another important family of congruence subgroups are the modular group defined as the set of all modular transformations for which , or equivalently, as the subgroup whose matrices become upper triangular upon reduction modulo . Note that is a subgroup of . The modular curves associated with these groups are an aspect of monstrous moonshine – for a prime number , the modular curve of the normalizer is genus zero if and only if divides the order of the monster group, or equivalently, if is a supersingular prime.

==Dyadic monoid==
One important subset of the modular group is the dyadic monoid, which is the monoid of all strings of the form for positive integers . This monoid occurs naturally in the study of fractal curves, and describes the self-similarity symmetries of the Cantor function, Minkowski&#x27;s question mark function, and the Koch snowflake, each being a special case of the general de Rham curve. The monoid also has higher-dimensional linear representations; for example, the representation can be understood to describe the self-symmetry of the blancmange curve.

==Maps of the torus==
The group is the linear maps preserving the standard lattice , and is the orientation-preserving maps preserving this lattice; they thus descend to self-homeomorphisms of the torus (SL mapping to orientation-preserving maps), and in fact map isomorphically to the (extended) mapping class group of the torus, meaning that every self-homeomorphism of the torus is isotopic to a map of this form. The algebraic properties of a matrix as an element of correspond to the dynamics of the induced map of the torus.

==Hecke groups==
The modular group can be generalized to the Hecke groups, named for Erich Hecke, and defined as follows.

The Hecke group with , is the discrete group generated by

:formula_64

where . For small values of , one has:

:formula_65

The modular group is isomorphic to and they share properties and applications – for example, just as one has the free product of cyclic groups

:formula_66

more generally one has

:formula_67

which corresponds to the triangle group . There is similarly a notion of principal congruence subgroups associated to principal ideals in .

==History==
The modular group and its subgroups were first studied in detail by Richard Dedekind and by Felix Klein as part of his Erlangen programme in the 1870s. However, the closely related elliptic functions were studied by Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1785, and further results on elliptic functions were published by Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi and Niels Henrik Abel in 1827.

<text>The Antarctic Circumpolar Wave (ACW) is a coupled ocean/atmosphere wave that circles the Southern Ocean in approximately eight years at . Since it is a wave-2 phenomenon (there are two ridges and two troughs in a latitude circle) at each fixed point in space a signal with a period of four years is seen. The wave moves eastward with the prevailing currents.

== History of the concept ==
Although the &quot;wave&quot; is seen in temperature, atmospheric pressure, sea ice and ocean height, the variations are hard to see in the raw data and need to be filtered to become apparent. Because the reliable record for the Southern Ocean is short (since the early 1980s) and signal processing is needed to reveal its existence, some climatologists doubt the existence of the wave. Others accept its existence but say that it varies in strength over decades.

The wave was discovered simultaneously by and . Since then, ideas about the wave structure and maintenance mechanisms have changed and grown: by some accounts it is now to be considered as part of a global ENSO wave.

<doc id="325024" wikidata="Q174588" url="?curid=325024" title="British Transport Police">
<text>British Transport Police (BTP; ) is a national special police force that polices the railway network of England, Wales and Scotland, which consists of over 10,000 miles of track and 3,000 stations and depots.

BTP also polices the London Underground, Docklands Light Railway, West Midlands Metro, Tramlink, part of the Tyne and Wear Metro, Glasgow Subway and the London Cable Car.

The force is funded primarily by the rail industry.

== Jurisdiction ==
As well as having jurisdiction across the national rail network, the BTP is also responsible for policing:
*London Underground
*Docklands Light Railway
*London Trams
*London Cable Car
*Glasgow Subway
*Tyne and Wear Metro (Sunderland branch)
*West Midlands Metro

This amounts to around of track and more than 3,000 railway stations and depots. There are more than one billion passenger journeys annually on the main lines alone.

In addition, BTP, in conjunction with the French National Police (under the Border Police unit) – – police the international services operated by Eurostar.

BTP is not responsible for policing the majority of the Tyne and Wear Metro, which is instead policed by Northumbria Police&#x27;s Metro Unit, nor the entirety of the Manchester Metrolink (policed by Greater Manchester Police). BTP also does not police heritage railways.

A BTP constable can act as a police constable outside their normal railway jurisdiction as described in the &quot;Powers and status of officers&quot; section.

===Previous jurisdiction===
BTP constables previously had jurisdiction at docks, ports, harbours and inland waterways, as well at some bus stations and British Transport Hotels. These roles fell away in 1985 with privatisation. The legislation was amended to reflect this in 1994.

== History ==
===Early days===
Private British railway companies employed detectives and police almost from the outset of passenger services in 1826. These companies were unified into four in 1923 then into a single nationalised company in 1947 by the Transport Act, which also created the British Transport Commission (BTC). On 1 January 1949 the British Transport Commission Police (BTCP) were created by the British Transport Commission Act 1949 which combined the already-existing police forces inherited from the pre-nationalisation railways by British Railways as well as the London Transport Police, canal police and several minor dock forces. In 1957 the Maxwell-Johnson enquiry found that policing requirements for the railway could not be met by territorial forces and that it was essential that a specialist police force be retained. On 1 January 1962 the British Transport Commission Police ceased to cover British Waterways property and exactly a year later when the BTC was abolished the name of the force was amended to the British Transport Police. 

===Racism===
In the 1960s and 1970s BTP officers led by Detective Sergeant Derek Ridgewell gave false testimony to obtain convictions of young men in the British Black community on the London Underground on charges such as assault with intent to rob. Eventually some of the men, who became known as the Oval Four and Stockwell Six, managed to have their convictions overturned. In November 2021, the BTP chief constable apologised to the black community for the trauma caused by Ridgewell, and said his actions did &quot;not define the BTP of today&quot;.
In July 2021 Deputy Chief Constable Adrian Hanstock stated that a review of Ridgewell&#x27;s record had &quot;not identified any additional matters that we feel should be referred for external review&quot;, this proved not to be a reliable statement as the Criminal Case Review Commission subsequently quashed the convictions of Basil Peterkin and Saliah Mehmet, 2 of 12 men convicted on Ridgewell&#x27;s evidence of theft from a goods depot in 1977. The CCRC appealed for &quot;anyone else who believes that they or a loved one, friend or acquaintance was a victim of a miscarriage of justice to contact the CCRC – particularly if DS Derek Ridgewell was involved.&quot;, indicating that there are many further victims of this corrupt, racist officer that the BTP have not identified in their flawed review.

===Changes===
In 1984 London Buses decided not to use the British Transport Police. The British Transport Docks Board followed in 1985 when it was privatised. This included undertaking immigration control at smaller ports until the Immigration Service expanded. The force crest still includes ports and harbours. BTP left the last ports it policed in 1990. The force played a central role in the response to the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Three of the incidents were at London Underground stations: Edgware Road (Circle Line), Russell Square and Aldgate stations, and the Number 30 bus destroyed at Tavistock Square was very close to the then force headquarters of the BTP, the latter incident being responded to initially by officers from the force. 

Like its predecessors, the BTP only powers available under common law to parishes, landowners and other bodies to appoint constables to patrol land and/or property under their control. This is distinct from the establishment of a police force by statute, as applicable to the Metropolitan Police in 1829. BTP finally gained jurisdiction on a statutory basis by the enactment of the Transport Police (Jurisdiction) Act 1994, which was subsequently amended by the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003.

===21st century===
In 2010, the force&#x27;s dog training was moved from a force-specific training establishment near Tadworth, Surrey (opened in 1984) to the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Dogs Training School in Keston, London Borough of Bromley. In May 2011, the Secretary of State for Transport Philip Hammond announced that British Transport Police would create an armed capability of its own with the added benefit of additional resilience and capacity to the overall UK police armed capability. The BTP are deployed on armed patrols using Glock 17 pistols, LMT AR-15 CQB carbines and tasers.

== List of chief constables ==
The BTP was led by a chief police officer from its inception until 1958, when Arthur West was appointed its first chief constable.
* Arthur West (1958–1963)
* William Owen Gay (1963–1974)
* Eric Haslam (1974–1981)
* Kenneth Ogram (1981–1989)
* Desmond O&#x27;Brien (1989–1997)
* David Williams (1997–2001)
* Ian Johnston (2001–2009)
* Andrew Trotter (2009–2014)
* Paul Crowther (2014–2021)
* Lucy D&#x27;Orsi (2021–present)

==Crime types==
=== Route crime ===
Route crime collectively describes crimes and offences of trespass and vandalism which occur on railway lines and can affect the running of train services. The majority of deaths are due to suicide or trespass.

Graffiti costs rail firms over £5million a year in direct costs alone. The BTP maintains a graffiti database which holds over 1900 graffiti tags, each unique to an individual. In 2005 BTP sent 569 suspects to court (an increase of 16% on 2004 figures).

In the North West Area BTP has joined forces with Lancashire Constabulary and Network Rail to combat theft of metal items and equipment from railway lines in an initiative called Operation Tremor. The BTP established Operation Drum in 2006 as a national response to the increase in metal theft offences and also chairs the relevant Association of Chief Police Officers working group.

===Passenger crime===

Operation Shield is an initiative by BTP to reduce the number of knives carried by passengers on the rail network. This initiative came about after knife crime began to rise and also because of the murder of a passenger on a Virgin CrossCountry service travelling from Glasgow.

In 2013, in response a survey conducted by Transport for London, which showed that 15% of women using public transport in London had been the subject of some form of unwanted sexual behaviour but that 90% of incidents went unreported, the BTP—in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police Service, City of London Police, and TfL—launched Project Guardian, which aimed to reduce sexual offences and increase reporting.

In November 2016 BTP introduced the &quot;See It, Say It, Sorted&quot; slogan in posters and on-train tannoy announcements, encouraging passengers to report suspicious activity.

== Funding ==
The British Transport Police is almost wholly funded by the train operating companies, Network Rail, and the London Underground – part of Transport for London. Around 95% of BTP&#x27;s funding comes from the train operating companies. Other operators with whom the BTP has a service agreement also contribute appropriately. This funding arrangement does not give the companies power to set objectives for the BTP, but there are industry representatives serving as members of the police authority. The police authority decides objectives. The industry membership represent five out of 13 members.

The force does not receive any direct funding from the Home Office, but may apply for grants – such as for special events, like the London 2012 Olympic Games. With BTP now playing a large role in counter-terrorism on the rail network, the force also receives some grants towards its firearms units.

The police authority has agreed its budget for 202122 at £328.1million.

== Operational structure ==

As of September 2021 BTP had a workforce of 3,113 police officers, 1,415 police staff, 251 police community support officers, 298 special constables, and 50 support volunteers. In terms of officer numbers it is the largest of the three special police forces and the 11th largest police force in the United Kingdom overall.

=== Divisions ===
From 1 April 2014, the divisional structure changed from the previous seven division structure to a four division structure - according to BTP this new structure will &#x27;deliver a more efficient force, generating savings to reinvest in more police officers across the railway network&#x27;.

==== A Division ====
Based at BTP Headquarters in Central London, this division retains overall control of the other divisions and houses central functions including forensics, CCTV and major investigations. , 393 police officers, 10 special constables and 946 police staff are based at FHQ.

==== B Division ====

This division covers London and the South East and southern areas of England. This division is further divided into the following sub-divisions:
* North
* Central
* South

, B Division houses the largest number of personnel of any BTP division: 1,444 police officers, 101 special constables, 191 PCSOs and 361 police staff.
==== C Division ====
This division covers the North East, North West, the Midlands, South West areas of England and Wales. This division is further divided into the following sub-divisions:
* Pennine
* Midland
* Wales
* Western

, C Division houses the second largest number of personnel within BTP: 921 police officers, 127 special constables, 132 PCSOs and 180 police staff.
==== D Division ====
This division covers Scotland. There are no sub-divisions within D Division.

, D Division is the smallest in terms of personnel housing 214 police officers, 24 special constables and 46 police staff.
==== E Division ====
E Division (Specialist Operations) was formed in 2020, removing the counter-terrorism units and assets from A Division, and placing them into their own division.

E division comprises the force&#x27;s specialist counter-terrorism units including the Firearms Unit, Dog Branch, Specialist Response Unit and others.

=== Former divisions ===
Prior to April 2014, BTP was divided into seven geographical basic command units (BCUs) which it referred to as &#x27;police areas&#x27;:

* Scotland (Area HQ in Glasgow)
* North Eastern (Area HQ in Leeds)
* North Western (Area HQ in Manchester)
* London North (Area HQ in London - Caledonian Road)
* London Underground (Area HQ in London - Broadway)
* London South (Area HQ in London - London Bridge Street)
* Wales &amp; Western (Area HQ in Birmingham)

Prior to 2007, there was an additional Midland Area and Wales and West Area; however, this was absorbed into the Wales and Western area and North Eastern area.

=== Communications and controls===
BTP operates two force control rooms and one call-handling centre:
*First Contact Centre: Based in Birmingham and responsible for handling all routine telephone traffic. This facility was created further to criticism by HMIC.
*Force Control Room – Birmingham: Based in Birmingham – alongside the First Contact Centre – and responsible for C and D Divisions which cover the East Midlands, West Midlands, Wales, the North West of England, the North East of England, the South West of England and Scotland.
*Force Control Room – London: Responsible for B Division which covers the South and East of England including Greater London (both TfL and Mainline).

Both FCRL and FCRB house an events control suite, and a &#x27;silver suite&#x27; incident control room is located in the South East for coordinating major incidents and as a fallback facility.

The Home Office DTELS callsign for BTP is &#x27;M2BX&#x27; and their events control suite is &#x27;M2AZ&#x27; for force-wide events and incidents, and the South East and &#x27;M2AY&#x27; for Outer London events and incidents.

BTP also have consoles within the Metropolitan Police C3i Special Operations Room (SOR).

The BTP can be contacted via their 61016 text service.

===Custody suites===
The force only acquired the power to designate custody suites in 2001, whereby all of the custody suites up until that point were non-designated. The force previously ran a number of non-designated custody suites around the country, which had all been closed down by 2014. A non-designated custody suite only allows police to detain someone for six hours before they are either released (whether charged, bailed or released without charge) or transferred to a designated facility.

The force retains one designated custody suite that is operational at Brewery Road in London (20 cells), where persons arrested within a reasonable travelling distance are taken. A number of other BTP custody suites were operational in London but these were closed in 2017 due to concerns regarding the time that it took to transport prisoners there.

Designated custody suites have also been retained as over-spill facilities in London, but are not routinely open, at the following locations: Central London (ten cells), Wembley Park (nine cells), Hammersmith (four cells) and West Ham (four cells).

=== Specialist units ===
==== Emergency Response Unit ====
A partnership between Transport for London (TfL) and BTP led to the formation of the ERU. The unit carries TfL engineers to incidents on the London Underground, such as one under accidents and terrorist incidents. The vehicles are driven by BTP officers, so once at the scene the officer performs regular policing duties in relation to any crime or public safety issues. The use of the blue lights on the unit&#x27;s vehicles is subject to the same criteria as with any other police vehicle In December 2013, TfL announced that the trial of blue lights had ended, and that ERU vehicles would retain blue lights, as BTP drivers had halved the unit&#x27;s response time to incidents. Some vehicles within the unit are dual liveried, allowing TfL engineers to operate the vehicles without a police driver. On these, &#x27;police&#x27; branding can be removed and the vehicles returned to the &#x27;emergency&#x27; branding utilised prior to the trial, with engineers utilising amber and red lighting as opposed to blue.
==== Emergency Intervention Unit ====
Similar schemes have been implemented elsewhere in the country, including a partnership with Network Rail and South West Trains (SWT) in which a BTP officer crews an &quot;Emergency Intervention Unit&quot;, which conveys engineers and equipment to incidents on SWT&#x27;s network using blue lights. The scheme won the &quot;passenger safety&quot; category at the UK Rail Industry Awards in 2015. Another &quot;Emergency Response Unit&quot; was established in partnership with Network Rail in the Glasgow area in the run-up to the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

==== Medic Response Unit ====
In May 2012, the BTP formed the Medic Response Unit to respond to medical incidents on the London Underground network, primarily to reduce disruption to the network during the 2012 Summer Olympics. The scheme was initially for a 12-month trial, and consisted of 20 police officers (18 police constables and two sergeants) and two dedicated fast-response cars. The officers attached to the unit each undertook a four-week course in pre-hospital care, funded by TfL. TfL estimated that around one third of delays on the London Underground were caused by &quot;passenger incidents&quot;, of which the majority related to medical problems with passengers; the purpose of the unit is to provide a faster response to medical incidents, providing treatment at the scene with the aim of reducing disruption to the network. The unit also aims to assist passengers who may be distressed after being trapped on trains while an incident at a station is resolved. Its training and equipment is the same as that of the London Ambulance Service in order to ensure smooth hand-overs of patients. At the end of the trial period, in October 2013, the unit was reduced to eight officers; the other twelve returned to regular policing duties after TfL judged the results of the scheme to be less than conclusive. Officers from the unit treated over 650 people in the first year of operation, including rescuing a passenger who fell onto the tracks, and made 50 arrests.

==== Firearms unit ====
In May 2011, the Secretary of State for Transport announced with agreement from the Home Secretary that approval had been given for BTP to develop a firearms capability following a submission to government in December by BTP. Government stated that this was not in response to any specific threat, and pointed out that it equipped the BTP with a capability that was already available to other police forces and that BTP relied upon police forces for assistance which was a burden.

In February 2012, BTP firearms officers commenced patrols focusing on mainline stations in London and transport hubs to provide a visible deterrence and immediate armed response if necessary. Firearms officers carry a Glock 17 handgun and a LMT CQB 10.5&quot; SBR carbine that may be fitted with a suppressor and are trained to armed response vehicle standard.

In 2014, the Firearms Act 1968 was amended to recognise BTP as a police force under the Act in order to provide BTP a firearms licensing exemption the same as other police forces.

In December 2016, firearms officers commenced patrolling on board train services on the London Underground.

In May 2017, as part of the response to the Manchester Arena bombing, it was announced that firearms officers would patrol on board trains outside London for the first time.

In June 2017, BTP announced that the force firearms capability would be expanding outside of London with plans to establish armouries and hubs at Birmingham and Manchester. In October 2017, BTP commenced an internal advertisement requesting expressions of interest from substantive constables for the role of firearms officers at Birmingham and Manchester.

== Powers and status of officers ==
=== General powers ===
Under s.31 of the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003, British Transport Police officers have &quot;all the power and privileges of a constable&quot; when:
*on track (any land or other property comprising the permanent way of any railway, taken together with the ballast, sleepers and rails laid thereon, whether or not the land or other property is also used for other purposes, any level crossings, bridges, viaducts, tunnels, culverts, retaining walls, or other structures used or to be used for the support of, or otherwise in connection with, track; and any walls, fences or other structures bounding the railway or bounding any adjacent or adjoining property)
*on network (a railway line, or installations associated with a railway line)
*in a station (any land or other property which consists of premises used as, or for the purposes of, or otherwise in connection with, a railway passenger station or railway passenger terminal (including any approaches, forecourt, cycle store or car park), whether or not the land or other property is, or the premises are, also used for other purposes)
*in a light maintenance depot,
*on other land used for purposes of or in relation to a railway, the transport police
*on other land in which a person who provides railway services has a freehold or leasehold interest, and
*throughout Great Britain for a purpose connected to a railway or to anything occurring on or in relation to a railway.

&quot;Railway&quot; means a system of transport employing parallel rails which provide support and guidance for vehicles carried on flanged wheels, and form a track which either is of a gauge of at least 350 millimetres or crosses a carriageway (whether or not on the same level).

A BTP constable may enter
* the track,
* a network,
* a station,
* a substation,
* a light maintenance depot, and
* a railway vehicle.
without a warrant, using reasonable force if necessary, and whether or not an offence has been committed.

====London Cable Car====
BTP officers derive their powers to police the London Cable Car from the London Cable Car Order 2012.

=== Outside natural jurisdiction ===
BTP officers need, however, to move between railway sites and often have a presence in city centres. Consequently, they can be called upon to intervene in incidents outside their natural jurisdiction. ACPO (now the NPCC) estimate that some 8,000 such incidents occur every year. As a result of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 BTP officers can act as police constables outside their normal jurisdiction in the following circumstances:

==== On the request of a constable ====
If requested by a constable of:
*a territorial police force,
*the Ministry of Defence Police (MDP), or
*the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC)
to assist him/her in the execution of their duties in relation to a particular incident, investigation or operation, a BTP constable also has the powers of the requesting officer for the purposes of that incident, investigation or operation. If a constable from a territorial police force makes the request, then the powers of the BTP constable extend only to the requesting constable&#x27;s police area. If a constable from the MDP or CNC makes the request, then the powers of the BTP officer are the same as those of the requesting constable.

==== On the request of a chief constable (mutual aid) ====
If requested by the chief constable of one of the forces mentioned above, a BTP constable takes on all the powers and privileges of members of the requesting force. This power is used for planned operations, such as the 2005 G8 summit at Gleneagles.

==== Spontaneous requirement outside natural jurisdiction ====
A BTP constable has the same powers and privileges of a constable of a territorial police force:
*in relation to people whom they suspect on reasonable grounds of having committed, being in the course of committing or being about to commit an offence, or
*if they believe on reasonable grounds that they need those powers and privileges in order to save life or to prevent or minimise personal injury or damage to property.

A BTP constable may only use such powers if he believes on reasonable grounds that if he cannot do so until he secures the attendance of or a request from a local constable (as above), the purpose for which he believes it ought to be exercised will be frustrated or seriously prejudiced.

The policing protocol between BTP and Home Office forces set outs the practical use of these extended powers.

==== Cross-border powers ====
===== Channel Tunnel Act 1987 =====
When policing the Channel Tunnel, BTP constables have the same powers and privileges as members of Kent Police when in France, and will also be under the direction and control of the Chief Constable of Kent.

===== Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 =====
A BTP constable can:

* When in Scotland, execute an arrest warrant, warrant of commitment and a warrant to arrest a witness (from England, Wales or Northern Ireland), and
* When in England or Wales, execute a warrant for committal, a warrant to imprison (or to apprehend and imprison) and a warrant to arrest a witness (from Scotland).

When executing a warrant issued in Scotland, a BTP constable executing it shall have the same powers and duties, and the person arrested the same rights, as they would have had if execution had been in Scotland by a constable of Police Scotland. When executing a warrant issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, a constable may use reasonable force and has specified search powers provided by section 139 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

===== Policing and Crime Act 2017 =====
A BTP constable, other than a special constable, can:

* When in Scotland, arrest an individual they suspect of committing a specified offence in England and Wales or Northern Ireland if the Constable is satisfied that it would not be in the best interests of justice to wait until a warrant has been issued under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 2004.
* When in England or Wales, arrest a person they suspect of committing a specified offence in Scotland or Northern Ireland, or the constable has reasonable grounds to believe that the arrest is necessary to allow the prompt and effective investigation of the offence or prevent the prosecution of the offence being hindered by the disappearance of the individual.

The power can be exercised on or off of transport property without restriction.

This is the only known power that is available to &#x27;regular&#x27; BTP constables and not BTP special constables as a result of the Policing and Crime Act 2017 stating that the power is available to constables attested under Section 24 of the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 (BTP special constables are appointed under Section 25 of the aforementioned Act).

====== National and international maritime policing powers ======

BTP constables (both &#x27;regular&#x27; and special constables) are designated as law enforcement officers in the same way as members of a territorial police force under Chapter 5 of the Act. This allows them to exercise maritime enforcement powers, including the powers of arrest for offences that could be subject to prosecution under the laws of England and Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland, in relation to:

* a British ship in England and Wales, Northern Ireland or Scottish waters, foreign waters or international waters,
* a ship without nationality in England and Wales waters or international waters,
* a foreign ship in England and Wales waters or international waters, or
* a ship, registered under the law of a relevant territory, in England and Wales waters or international waters.

=== Attestation ===

Constables of the BTP are required by S.24 of the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 (and special constables of the BTP are required by S.25) to make one of the following attestations, depending on the jurisdiction in which they have been appointed:

==== England and Wales ====
[Police Act 1996, Schedule 4 as amended.]

The attestation can be made in Welsh.

==== Scotland ====
Constables are required to make the declaration required by s.10 of the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 before a sheriff or justice of the peace.

=== Status ===

A BTP constable does not lose the ability to exercise his powers when off duty. Section 22 of the Infrastructure Act 2015 repealed section 100(3)(a) of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 which required BTP officers to be in uniform or in possession of documentary evidence (i.e. their warrant card) in order to exercise their powers. The repeal of this subsection, which came into effect on 12 April 2015, now means BTP officers are able to use their powers on or off duty and in uniform or plain clothes regardless of whether they are in possession of their warrant card.

On 1 July 2004 a police authority for the British Transport Police was created. BTP officers became employees of the police authority; prior to that, they were employees of the Strategic Rail Authority.

== Rank insignia ==
== Special constabulary ==
===History===
British Transport Police first recruited special constables in a trial based in the North West Area in 1995, and this was expanded to the whole of the UK.

Many specials are recruited from the wider railway community and those working for train operating companies are encouraged by their employers.

===Powers and Authority===
Under the terms of the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 and the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, BTP special constables have identical jurisdiction and powers to BTP regular constables; primary jurisdiction on any railway in Great Britain and a conditional jurisdiction in any other police force area.

===Uniform===
BTP specials do not wear the &#x27;SC&#x27; insignia (a crown with the letters SC underneath) on their epaulettes unlike some of their counterparts in some Home Office police forces.

===Size===
As of March 2023, the BTP Special Constabulary held a headcount of just over 240 officers working across Great Britain. The headcount for the Special Constabulary sits just under 500.

===Structure===
The special constabulary has followed many Home Office forces in implementing a rank structure for special constables.

As of January 2024, the need to complete a promotion exam was removed, and two ranks were removed; Special Superintendent and Special Chief Inspector. It continues to be led by a Special Chief Officer and a Special Deputy Chief Officer. Each division has a number of Special Inspectors and Special Sergeants who continue to lead and manage their teams.

===Federation and Taser===
In January 2022 the British Transport Police Police Federation allowed BTP special Constables to join, a precondition for an announcement in May 2022 that specials would be trained to carry tasers.

===Rank Structure===
The BTP Special Constabulary rank structure differs from the regular officers&#x27; structure, although some are similar.

The structure is as follows:

Special Constables can progress up the rank structure. Whilst the names may be similar to other ranks (e.g. Inspector), the insignia is different, so that regulars and Specials can be easily distinguished.

== Police community support officers (PCSO) ==

British Transport Police are the only special police force that employ police community support officers (PCSOs). Section 28 of the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 allows the BTP Chief Constable to recruit PCSOs and designate powers to them using the Police Reform Act 2002, which previously only extended to chief constables or commissioners of territorial police forces.
The BTP started recruiting PCSOs on 13 December 2004. The first of them went out on patrol for the first time on Wednesday 5 January 2005. They mostly work in the force&#x27;s neighbourhood policing teams (NPTs).

BTP is one of only three forces to issue its PCSOs handcuffs, the other two being North Wales Police and Dyfed-Powys Police. This is in addition to leg restraints. BTP PCSOs also utilise generally more powers than their counterparts in other forces.

As of 2016, the BTP has 362 PCSOs.

Although BTP polices in Scotland (D Division) it does not have any PCSOs in Scotland due to limitations of the Police Reform Act 2002, the law that empowers PCSOs which does not extend to Scotland. Although unlike police officers there is no formal transfer process. BTP is known to often attract PCSOs already serving in other police forces.

One of BTPs PCSOs is credited with making the force&#x27;s largest ever illegal drugs seizure from one passenger when on 30 September 2009 PCSO Dan Sykes noticed passenger James Docherty acting suspiciously in Slough railway station only to find him in possession of £200,000 worth of Class C drugs. PCSO Sykes then detained Docherty who was then arrested and later imprisoned after trial.

In 2006 PCSO George Roach became the first BTP PCSO to be awarded a Chief Constable&#x27;s Commendation after he saved a suicidal man from an oncoming train at Liverpool Lime Street railway station.

== Accident investigation == 
Until the 1990s the principal investigators of railway accidents were the inspecting officers of HM Railway Inspectorate, and BTP involvement was minimal. With major accidents after the 1988 Clapham Junction rail crash being investigated by more adversarial public inquiries, the BTP took on a more proactive role in crash investigations. Further reforms led to the creation by the Department for Transport of the Rail Accident Investigation Branch which takes the lead role in investigations of accidents.

== Proposed mergers and jurisdiction reforms ==

Although the British Transport Police is not under the control of the Home Office, and as such was not included as part of the proposed mergers of the Home Office forces of England and Wales in early 2006, both the then London mayor Ken Livingstone and then head of the Metropolitan Police Sir Ian Blair stated publicly that they wanted a single police force in Greater London. As part of this, they wished to have the functions of the BTP within Greater London absorbed by the Metropolitan Police. However, following a review of the BTP by the Department for Transport, no changes to the form and function of the force were implemented, and any proposed merger did not happen.

There were Scottish government proposals for the BTP&#x27;s Scottish division (D Division) to be merged with Police Scotland. However, the merger was postponed indefinitely in August 2018.

In 2006 it was suggested BTP take on airport policing nationally.

In 2010, it was suggested that BTP take on VOSA traffic officers and Highways England traffic officers. It was estimated BTP would save £25million if this went ahead. Contrary to popular belief, it was not proposed to merge Home office forces traffic units.

As of 2017 the government made a manifesto commitment to merge BTP, the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and Ministry of Defence Police into a single &quot;British Infrastructure Police&quot;. Originally after the 2015 Paris attacks, it was thought fully arming BTP and merging the three force would create a significant boost to firearms officer numbers in the UK and they could act as a nationwide counter terrorism force. Two options for this were developed;

Option 1: A single National Infrastructure Constabulary combining the function of the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, the Ministry of Defence Police, the British Transport Police, the Highways England Traffic Officer Service, DVSA uniformed enforcement officers and Home Office police forces&#x27; airport and port police units, along with private port police; or

Option 2: A Transport Infrastructure Constabulary and an Armed Infrastructure Constabulary, with the first bringing together the functions carried out by BTP, the Highways England Traffic Officer Service, DVSA uniformed enforcement officers and Home Office police forces&#x27; airport and port police units, along with private port police. The Armed Infrastructure force would be a merger of MDP and CNC.

Discussing the review in January 2017, DCC Hanstock commented on the specific responsibilities of BTP and stakeholder responses to the infrastructure policing review:
In June 2018 it was reported that these proposals had also been shelved for the time being. The only consensus it seems is that BTP would be suited to taking on airport and port policing as opposed to other modes of transport.

<text>Mount Greylock is the highest point in Massachusetts at 3,489 feet (1,063 meters). Located in the northwest region of the state, it is part of the Taconic Mountains, a geologically distinct range from the nearby Berkshires and Green Mountains. Expansive views and a small area of sub-alpine forest characterize its upper reaches. A seasonal automobile road crosses the summit area near three structures from the 1930s; these together constitute a small National Historic District. Various hiking paths including the Appalachian Trail traverse the area, which is part of the larger Mount Greylock State Reservation.

The peak is mentioned in the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, and Henry David Thoreau.

==Geography==

Mount Greylock is part of an massif called the &quot;Greylock Range&quot; near the Hoosic River, which hooks around the mountain on its eastern and northern footings. Various summits include Saddle Ball Mountain, along with Mount Fitch and others.

Standing about 2,000 feet (610 meters) above the local Hoosic Valley, Mount Greylock&#x27;s summit is in Adams, Massachusetts. Other parts of the range extend into five neighboring towns. Sight lines of up to are possible from Greylock.

The Greylock massif is part of the Taconic Mountains, a geologically distinct range from the nearby Berkshires and Green Mountains separated here by the nearby Hoosic Valley.

The massif is mostly within the Hudson River watershed via the Hoosic River, although a small part near Lanesborough is within the Housatonic River watershed.

The eastern slopes of Greylock are noted for the Thunderbolt ski trail (see below), landslide scars above the city of Adams and &quot;Greylock Glen,&quot; a state-sponsored development plan. The western slopes include &quot;The Hopper,&quot; a twin-pronged valley caused by erosion. The mountain&#x27;s north and southern reaches are noted for the presence of an auto road as well as hiking trails.

===Climate===
==Forests and birds==

Northern hardwood forest characterize lower and mid-elevations, while upper slopes are covered with balsam fir and red spruce as well as American mountain ash. About of old growth forest have been inventoried within the Greylock Range, including tree specimens up to 350 years old. On the western slope was a red spruce.

There are purported records of 132 bird species on the mountain. These include the blackpoll warbler and Bicknell&#x27;s thrush which breed exclusively in boreal forest, with limited opportunities elsewhere in Massachusetts.

==Geology==
Mount Greylock is part of the much larger Taconic Allochthon, a structure that migrated to its present position from 25 miles to the east. The rocks moved via thrust faulting, a tectonic process by which older rock is thrust over and above younger rock.

More narrowly, the local massif is mostly &quot;Greylock Schist,&quot; a term used by geologists starting in 1891 and much more recently, although the age of these rocks had been uncertain into the 1960s. This Ordovician schist is about 1,000 to 2,000 feet thick on Greylock and &quot;consists of muscovite (sericite), chlorite, and quartz schist.&quot; It lies above a formation called &quot;Bellows Pipe Limestone.&quot; This younger, underlying layer has been quarried on the lower slopes of the mountain.

Successive episodes of ice-age glaciation rounded the mountain, leaving glacial erratics such as &quot;Balanced Rock&quot; on Greylock in Lanesborough.
The Laurentide Ice Sheet had covered the region up to a depth of one kilometer (or 3,281 feet). In melting, it formed Lake Bascom in the upper Hoosic Valley.
The remains of lake beaches are evident at several places on the lowest slopes of Greylock.

Geologists used Surface Exposure Dating in 2018 to measure the rate of Pleistocene de-glaciation of the region. This method offered data in support of a more rapid melting rate in New England compared with earlier estimates.

==Name==
&quot;Mount Greylock&quot; as the mountain&#x27;s present name &quot;probably originated with Williams College Professor Albert Hopkins&quot; (1807–1872) or another local professor of the same era, according to one 1988 source. The peak&#x27;s namesake, Gray Lock(c. 1670–1750) was an Abenaki tribal figure from near Westfield, Massachusetts, known for raiding English outposts near the Connecticut River and not historically associated with the mountain.

The 18th century English may have called the peak &quot;Grand Hoosuc,&quot; although Timothy Dwight IV referred to it as &quot;Saddle Mountain&quot; in his travel memoir concerning the late 18th century.

In the early 19th century it was called &quot;Saddleback Mountain&quot; because of its appearance seen from the south.
According to a 1838 journal entry (posthumously published 1868), Nathaniel Hawthorne overheard a local resident calling it &quot;Graylock.&quot; Hawthorne added that Saddleback &quot;is a more usual name for it.&quot; Yet elsewhere Hawthorne simply called it Graylock, attributing this name to the mountain&#x27;s frequent appearance in winter frost.

Nonetheless, as of 1841, Edward Hitchcock&#x27;s authoritative &quot;Final Report&quot; on state geology called the entire massif &quot;Saddle Mountain&quot; and &quot;the highest point of the summit&quot; according to Hitchcock was called &quot;Graylock.&quot; .

==Historic District==
Three structures contribute to the 1930s &quot;Mount Greylock Summit Historic District,&quot; which is part of the National Register of Historic Places as of 1998. These are the Bascom Lodge and the Thunderbolt Ski Shelter, both designed by Pittsfield architect, Joseph McArthur Vance, and the War Memorial Tower designed by Boston-based Maginnis &amp; Walsh. Together, their cultural significance as period architecture was cited in the register

=== Bascom Lodge === 

Bascom Lodge was built between 1932 and 1938 using native materials of Greylock schist and red spruce and characterized by the rustic design of period park structures. The Greylock Commission sought a more substantial shelter to replace an earlier summit house (built c.1902; destroyed by fire in 1929). The initial west wing was constructed in 1932 by Jules Emil Deloye Jr. The main-central and east wings were completed later 1935–38 by the Civilian Conservation Corps, supervised by Deloye. The lodge was named in honor of John Bascom, a Greylock Reservation Commissioner and local professor (d. 1911).

For the winter of 1937–38, the Greylock Commission hired Harrison L. Lasuer to spend the season living in the lodge &quot;to act as host to skiers and other Winter enthusiasts who scale the mountain.&quot;. The building was equipped for that winter with &quot;steam heat, electricity and a telephone,&quot; according to a New York City newspaper. A ski race later that season attracted 7,000 spectators, mainly near the base of the mountain (see ref. below).

Today, Bascom Lodge is run (in warmer months only) by a service company under a concession-type lease from the state. Among other earlier arrangements, the Appalachian Mountain Club managed the lodge for 16 summers ending in 2000.

=== Thunderbolt Ski Shelter, Trail and Race Series ===
The Thunderbolt Ski Shelter, also designed by Joseph McArthur Vance, was built in 1940 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) as a warming hut for skiers using the Thunderbolt Trail.

Like the nearby lodge, the shelter is rustic in design and built of local stone and wood beams; the interior has four wooden benches built into a large four-hearth fireplace in the center. It is several hundred feet north of the summit tower.

Although Bascomb Lodge reportedly employed a resident winter innkeeper in 1938 (see above citation), the 1940 introduction of this nearby shelter may have made a seasonal shut-down of the lodge less inconvenient during large-scale ski events of the era.

This trail was designed with help from numerous ski groups and cut by the CCC in 1934. Major competitive ski races were held on here almost annually from 1935 until 1948. Among the largest was a 1938 event attended by 7,000 spectators, who watched Fritz Dehmel of Nazi Germany set a course record of 2 minutes and 25 seconds. Famed U.S. skier Dick Durrance placed fifth in this race, which pre-dated the Thunderbolt shelter. Dehmel&#x27;s record for the 1.4-mile course held until 1948. The trail is similar in steepness to the longer Sherburne Trail of Pinkham Notch, New Hampshire.

The Thunderbolt ski race was revived in 2010 and in certain subsequent years, but a lack of snow disrupted or relocated some of the events to commercial ski areas with artificial snow. In 2018, the race group said it would switch to &quot;less frequent intervals&quot; for the event, instead of annually. 
 Separately, a 1990s landslide area on the eastern face of Greylock that is unrelated to the Thunderbolt trail was reportedly skied in 2005 

=== Veterans War Memorial Tower ===

The Veterans War Memorial Tower was approved by the state legislature in 1930, supported by local lawmakers and Governor Frank G. Allen. It was completed two years later at a cost of $200,000 by contractors J.G. Roy &amp; Son of Springfield. An estimated 1,500 people attended the 1933 dedication by Governor Joseph B. Ely, an event broadcast nationally over NBC radio.

The shaft with eight observation windows, was designed to display classic austerity. It includes Art Deco details, some by John Bizzozero of Quincy, whose work also appears on the Vermont Capitol building. Inside at ground level is a domed chamber intended to store tablets and war relics.

Although area legislators and residents wanted local stone, the tower&#x27;s granite facing was obtained in Quincy. The tower bears various inscriptions including, &quot;they were faithful even unto death.&quot; One of the inscriptions inside the monument reads, &quot;Of those immortal dead who live again in the minds made better by their presence&quot;, which is a line from a poem by George Eliot. The translucent globe of light on top, originally illuminated by twelve 1,500 watt lights (now six), is said to be visible at night for . It creates a light-pollution problem for the summit area all night long.

The Veterans War Memorial Tower was closed for four years beginning in 2013 because of water infiltration that caused structural damage from freezing. A $2.6-million restoration project that began in August 2015 was awarded to Allegrone Construction of Pittsfield.

=== Broadcast tower ===
Although not as part of the Historic District, one radio and one television station transmit from a broadcast tower below the summit on the west side: WAMC (90.3 Albany, New York); and W38DL (38 Adams, Massachusetts) (repeater of WNYT-TV). A NOAA Weather Radio station (WWF-48, 162.525 MHz) broadcasts from a different tower on the mountain. The Northern Berkshire Amateur Radio Club runs several amateur radio repeaters on the mountain under the callsign K1FFK.

==History==

=== In American Literature ===
By the mid-19th century, improved transportation into the region attracted many visitors to Greylock. Among them were writers and artists inspired by the mountain scene: Nathaniel Hawthorne, William Cullen Bryant, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Herman Melville, and Henry David Thoreau.

In the summer of 1838, Hawthorne had visited North Adams, Massachusetts, and climbed Mount Greylock several times. His experiences there, specifically a walk he took at midnight where he saw a burning lime kiln, inspired his story, originally titled &quot;The Unpardonable Sin&quot;. Hawthorne had not written tales since 1844 when he wrote &quot;Ethan Brand&quot; in the winter of 1848–1849.

Melville is said to have taken part of his inspiration for &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; from the view of the mountain from his house Arrowhead in Pittsfield, since its snow-covered profile reminded him of a great white sperm whale&#x27;s back breaking the ocean&#x27;s surface. Melville dedicated his next novel, &quot;&quot;, to &quot;Greylock&#x27;s Most Excellent Majesty&quot;, calling the mountain &quot;my own ... sovereign lord and king&quot;. In August 1851 Melville and a few friends, including the young poet Sarah Morewood, camped for a night on Greylock&#x27;s summit. Thoreau summited and spent a night in July 1844. His account of this event in &quot;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers&quot; described his approach up what is today the Bellows Pipe Trail. Scholars contend that this Greylock experience transformed him, affirming his ability to do these excursions on his own, following his brother John&#x27;s death; and served as a prelude to his experiment of rugged individualism at Walden Pond the following year in 1845.
Timothy Dwight IV, a once-famed poet and preacher, and president of Yale College, along with Williams College President Ebenezer Fitch, climbed Greylock in 1799, probably over a rough route cut by a local farmer Jeremiah Wilbur. Dwight&#x27;s travel memoir describes the mountain: &quot;During a great part of the year, it is either embosomed or capped by clouds, and indicates to the surrounding inhabitants the changes of weather with not a little exactness.&quot;

=== Management and development history ===

Williams College students in 1830 directed by college President Edward Dorr Griffin improved and further cut a trail from the end of the Hopper Road to the summit. This is the current Hopper Trail, traditionally climbed by Williams students once a year.

In May 1831 a wooden meteorological observatory, &quot;Griffin&#x27;s Tower&quot;, was built on the summit by students. Nine years later, it was replaced by a more substantial wooden tower, from which Donati&#x27;s Comet was photographed in 1858. In 1863 the &quot;Alpine Club&quot;, was founded in Williamstown by Professor Albert Hopkins. The club frequently camped on the mountain and certain members later helped found the Appalachian Mountain Club and the American Alpine Club.

By the late 19th century, clearcutting had stripped most of Greylock&#x27;s forest. Along with this came forest fires and landslides. The Greylock Park Association (GPA) was formed in 1885 and shares were sold locally with plans to make money by attracting tourists. The company purchased on the summit and made repairs to the Notch Road. The GPA charged a 25-cent toll for the carriage road and a 10-cent fee to ascend the iron observation tower (built 1889). Together, these fees are equivalent to $ in present-day dollars.

But 12 years later, with the GPA&#x27;s business future imperiled by debt, local legislators proposed acquiring the company and forming Mount Greylock State Reservation. This was approved in 1898 along with plans to add to the original land (to ultimately total . The Berkshire County government was to maintain the reservation. Other early State Reservation properties were similarly operated by local county governments.

===The 20th century===

The first automobiles to the summit, via the Notch Road from the north, were a pair of steam-powered &quot;Locomobiles&#x27; in 1902; a gasoline-powered car followed in 1904. In 1907, Berkshire County Commission opened a new road from the south to the summit, augmenting the existing northerly &quot;Notch Road.&quot; The county subsequently attended to building hiking paths, and by 1913 had completed 17 trails. The Appalachian Trail route across the mountain was opened in 1929, and the entire Massachusetts section was mostly complete by 1931.

The Massachusetts (Veterans) War Memorial Tower on the summit was completed in 1932. During nine years ending in 1941 the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) worked on the mountain mostly through its 107th Company, MA camp SP-7.

CCC work included improvements to the road system (gravel surfaced), Adirondack lean-to shelters, the Thunderbolt Ski Shelter and its related trail, along with constructing much of Bascom Lodge.

Starting in 1954, the Greylock Tramway Authority was formed to build an aerial tramway on the mountain. After the authority announced plans for a ski resort in 1964, a local conservation group called the Mount Greylock Protective Association led a campaign to shift the Reservation to state management from Berkshire County. This succeeded in 1966 and helped to block the resort.

==State parks==
The Mount Greylock State Reservation is managed and operated by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.
Mount Greylock has about 70 miles of hiking paths including an 11.5 mile section of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. Primitive camping for backpackers is permitted at several sites. The staffed visitors&#x27; center in Lanesborough is open year-round (1.5 miles off Route 7).

The Greylock Glen, site of a former proposed tramway/ski/resort development from 1953 to 1977, is a park in Adams, adjoining Mount Greylock State Reservation. It was acquired by the state in 1985 for joint public-private development.

<text>Technological escalation describes the situation where two parties in competition tend to employ continual technological improvements in their attempt to defeat each other. Technology is defined here as a creative invention, either in the form of an object or a methodology. An example is the mutual escalation seen between e-mail spammers and the programmers of spam filters and other anti-spam techniques. Although escalation is usually meant negatively, if two companies are in an escalating competition to produce the best widget, the consumer benefits because they get a choice between better and better widgets.

<text>Historical geology or palaeogeology is a discipline that uses the principles and methods of geology to reconstruct the geological history of Earth. Historical geology examines the vastness of geologic time, measured in billions of years, and investigates changes in the Earth, gradual and sudden, over this deep time. It focuses on geological processes, such as plate tectonics, that have changed the Earth&#x27;s surface and subsurface over time and the use of methods including stratigraphy, structural geology, paleontology, and sedimentology to tell the sequence of these events. It also focuses on the evolution of life during different time periods in the geologic time scale.

==Historical development==
During the 17th century, Nicolas Steno was the first to observe and propose a number of basic principles of historical geology, including three key stratigraphic principles: the law of superposition, the principle of original horizontality, and the principle of lateral continuity.

18th-century geologist James Hutton contributed to an early understanding of the Earth&#x27;s history by proposing the theory of uniformitarianism, which is now a basic principle in all branches of geology. Uniformitarianism describes an Earth formed by the same natural phenomena that are at work today, the product of slow and continuous geological changes. The theory can be summarized by the phrase &quot;the present is the key to the past.&quot; Hutton also described the concept of deep time. The prevailing conceptualization of Earth history in 18th-century Europe, grounded in a literal interpretation of Christian scripture, was that of a young Earth shaped by catastrophic events. Hutton, however, depicted a very old Earth, shaped by slow, continuous change. Charles Lyell further developed the theory of uniformitarianism in the 19th century. Modern geologists have generally acknowledged that Earth&#x27;s geological history is a product of both sudden, cataclysmic events (such as meteorite impacts and volcanic eruptions) and gradual processes (such as weathering, erosion, and deposition).

The discovery of radioactive decay in the late 19th century and the development of radiometric dating techniques in the 20th century provided a means of deriving absolute ages of events in geological history. 

== Use and importance ==
Geology is considered a historical science; accordingly, historical geology plays a prominent role in the field.

Historical geology covers much of the same subject matter as physical geology, the study of geological processes and the ways in which they shape the Earth&#x27;s structure and composition. Historical geology extends physical geology into the past.

Economic geology, the search for and extraction of fuel and raw materials, is heavily dependent on an understanding of the geological history of an area. Environmental geology, which examines the impacts of natural hazards such as earthquakes and volcanism, must rely on a detailed knowledge of geological history.

== Methods ==

=== Stratigraphy ===
Layers of rock, or strata, represent a geologic record of Earth&#x27;s history. Stratigraphy is the study of strata: their order, position, and age.

=== Structural geology ===
Structural geology is concerned with rocks&#x27; deformational histories.

=== Paleontology ===
Fossils are organic traces of Earth&#x27;s history. In a historical geology context, paleontological methods can be used to study fossils and their environments, including surrounding rocks, and place them within the geologic time scale.

=== Sedimentology ===
Sedimentology is the study of the formation, transport, deposition, and diagenesis of sediments. Sedimentary rocks, including limestone, sandstone, and shale, serve as a record of Earth&#x27;s history: they contain fossils and are transformed by geological processes, such as weathering, erosion, and deposition, through deep time.

=== Relative dating ===

Historical geology makes use of relative dating in order to establish the sequence of geological events in relation to each another, without determining their specific numerical ages or ranges.

=== Absolute dating ===

Absolute dating allows geologists to determine a more precise chronology of geological events, based on numerical ages or ranges. Absolute dating includes the use of radiometric dating methods, such as radiocarbon dating, potassium–argon dating, and uranium–lead dating. Luminescence dating, dendrochronology, and amino acid dating are other methods of absolute dating.

== Plate tectonics ==
The theory of plate tectonics explains how the movement of lithospheric plates has structured the Earth throughout its geological history.

== Weathering, erosion, and deposition ==
Weathering, erosion, and deposition are examples of gradual geological processes, taking place over large sections of the geologic time scale. In the rock cycle, rocks are continually broken down, transported, and deposited, cycling through three main rock types: sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous.

== Paleoclimatology ==
Paleoclimatology is the study of past climates recorded in geological time.

<doc id="325035" wikidata="Q1468462" url="?curid=325035" title="Kharja">
<text>A kharja or kharjah ( ; ; ; also known as a markaz &#x27;center&#x27;), is the final couple of &quot;abyāt&quot;, or verses, of a &quot;muwaššaḥa&quot; ( &#x27;girdle&#x27;), a poem or song of the strophic lyric genre from al-Andalus. The &quot;kharja&quot; can be in a language that is different from the body; a &quot;muwaššaḥ&quot; in literary Arabic might have a &quot;kharja&quot; in vernacular Andalusi Arabic or in a mix of Arabic and Andalusi Romance, while a &quot;muwaššaḥ&quot; in Hebrew might contain a &quot;kharja&quot; in Arabic, Romance, Hebrew, or a mix. 

The &quot;muwashshah&quot; typically consists of five strophes of four to six lines, alternating with five or six refrains (&quot;qufl&quot;); each refrain has the same rhyme and metre, whereas each stanza has only the same metre. The &quot;kharja&quot; appears often to have been composed independently of the &quot;muwashshah&quot; in which it is found.
==Characteristics of the kharja==
About a third of extant &quot;kharjas&quot; are written in Classical Arabic. Most of the remainder are in Andalusi Arabic, but there are about seventy examples that are written either in Iberian Romance languages or with significant Romance elements.

Generally, though not always, the &quot;kharja&quot; is presented as a quotation from a speaker who is introduced in the preceding stanza.

It is not uncommon to find the same &quot;kharja&quot; attached to several different &quot;muwashshahat&quot;. The Egyptian writer Ibn Sanā&#x27; al-Mulk (1155–1211), in his &quot;Dar al-Tirāz&quot; (a study of the &quot;muwashshahat&quot;, including an anthology) states that the &quot;kharja&quot; was the most important part of the poem, that the poets generated the &quot;muwashshah&quot; from the &quot;kharja&quot;, and that consequently it was considered better to borrow a good &quot;kharja&quot; than compose a bad one.

&quot;Kharjas&quot; may describe love, praise, the pleasures of drinking, but also ascetism.

== Corpora ==

=== Corpus of Arabic &quot;muwaššaḥāt&quot; ===
Of the approximately 600 known secular Arabic &quot;muwaššaḥāt&quot;, there are almost 300 &quot;kharjas&quot; in vernacular Andalusi Arabic and over 200 in Standard Arabic (), though some of the vernacular &quot;kharjas&quot; are essentially Standard Arabic with a vulgar gloss. About 50 are in Andalusi Romance or contain some Romance words or elements. 

=== Corpus of Hebrew &quot;muwaššaḥāt&quot; ===
About half of the corpus of the more than 250 known &quot;muwaššaḥāt&quot; in Hebrew have &quot;kharjas&quot; in Arabic. There about roughly 50 with &quot;kharjas&quot; in Hebrew, and about 25 with Romance. There are also a few &quot;kharjas&quot; with a combination of Hebrew and Arabic.

=== Others ===
In their experimentation of the &quot;muwaššaḥ&quot; genre, the Mashriqi writers Ibn Sanā&#x27; al-Mulk and as-Safadi made &quot;kharjas&quot; in different languages using Persian and Turkish.

==Romance kharjas==

Though they comprise only a fraction of the corpus of extant &quot;kharjas&quot;, it is the Romance &quot;kharjas&quot; that have attracted the greatest scholarly interest. With examples dating back to the 11th century, this genre of poetry is believed to be among the oldest in any Romance language, and certainly the earliest recorded form of lyric poetry in Andalusi Romance or another Iberian Romance language.

Their rediscovery in the 20th century by Hebrew scholar Samuel Miklos Stern and Arabist Emilio García Gómez is generally thought to have cast new light on the evolution of Romance languages.

The Romance &quot;kharjas&quot; are thematically comparatively restricted, being almost entirely about love. Approximately three-quarters of them are put into the mouths of women, while the proportion for Arabic &quot;kharjas&quot; is nearer one-fifth.

===Debate over origins===

Since the &quot;kharja&quot; may be written separately from the &quot;muwashshah&quot;, many scholars have speculated that the Romance kharjas were originally popular Spanish lyrics that the court poets incorporated into their poems. Some similarities have been claimed with other early Romance lyrics in theme, metre, and idiom. Arabic writers from the Middle East or North Africa like Ahmad al-Tifashi (1184–1253) referred to &quot;songs in the Christian style&quot; sung in al-Andalus from ancient times that some have identified as the &quot;kharjas&quot;.

Other scholars dispute such claims, arguing that the &quot;kharjas&quot; stand firmly within the Arabic tradition with little or no Romance input at all, and the apparent similarities only arise because the &quot;kharjas&quot; discuss themes that are universal in human literature anyway.

===Debate over language and reading===

Modern translations of the Romance &quot;kharjas&quot; are a matter of debate particularly because the Arabic script does not include vowels. Most of them were copied by scribes who probably did not understand the language they were recording, which may have caused transmission errors. A large spectrum of translations is possible given the ambiguity created by the missing vowels and potentially erroneous consonants. Because of this, most translations of these texts will be disputed by some. Severe criticism has been made of García Gómez&#x27;s editions because of his palaeographical errors. Further debate arises around the mixed vocabulary used by the authors.

Most of the Romance &quot;kharjas&quot; are not written entirely in Romance, but include Arabic elements to a greater or lesser extent. It has been argued that such blending cannot possibly represent the natural speech patterns of the Romance speakers, and that the Romance &quot;kharjas&quot; must therefore be regarded as macaronic literature.

A minority of scholars, such as Richard Hitchcock contend that the Romance Kharjas are, in fact, not predominantly in a Romance language at all, but rather an extremely colloquial Arabic idiom bearing marked influence from the local Romance varieties. Such scholars accuse the academic majority of misreading the ambiguous script in untenable or questionable ways and ignoring contemporary Arab accounts of how &quot;Muwashshahat&quot; and &quot;Kharjas&quot; were composed.

==Examples==

===Romance===
An example of a Romance &quot;kharja&quot; (and translation) by the Jewish poet Judah Halevi:

These verses express the theme of the pain of longing for the absent lover (&quot;habib&quot;). Many scholars have compared such themes to the Galician-Portuguese cantigas de amigo which date from c. 1220 to c. 1300, but “[t]he early trend […] towards seeing a genetic link between &quot;kharajat&quot; and &quot;cantigas d&#x27;amigo&quot; seems now to have been over-hasty.” 

===Arabic===
An example of an Arabic &quot;kharja&quot;:

:How beautiful is the army with its orderly ranks
:When the champions call out, ‘Oh, Wāthiq, oh, handsome one!’

The &quot;kharja&quot; is from a &quot;muwashshah&quot; in the &quot;Dar al-Tirāz&quot; of Ibn Sanā&#x27; al-Mulk.

==History of &quot;kharja&quot; scholarship==

=== Manuscript sources ===
Ibn Sanāʾ al-Mulk, a 12th century Egyptian poet, wrote an anthology and study of the &quot;muwaššaḥ&quot; and its &quot;kharja&quot; entitled &quot;Dār aṭ-ṭirāz fī ʿamal al-muwas̲h̲s̲h̲aḥāt&quot; ().&quot;&quot; The Syrian scholar published an edition of the work in 1949.&quot;&quot;

Ibn al-Khatib, a 14th century Andalusi poet, compiled an anthology of &quot;muwaššaḥāt&quot; entitled &quot;Jaysh at-Tawshĩḥ&quot; (). Alan Jones published a modern edition of this work.

An anthology of &quot;muwaššaḥāt&quot; entitled &quot;Uddat al-Jalīs&quot; ()&quot;,&quot; attributed to a certain Ali ibn Bishri al-Ighranati, is based on a manuscript taken from Morocco in 1948 by Georges Séraphin Colin (1893-1977). Alan Jones published an Arabic edition in 1992.

Ibn Bassam wrote in () that the &quot;kharja&quot; was the initial text around which the rest of the &quot;muwaššaḥ&quot; was composed.

Ibn Khaldun also mentions the &quot;muwaššaḥ&quot; and its &quot;kharja&quot; in his &quot;Muqaddimah&quot;.

=== Modern study ===
In 1948, the Hungarian linguist Samuel Miklos Stern published &quot;&quot; in the journal &quot;al-Andalus&quot;, translated into English in 1974 as &quot;The Final Lines of Hebrew&quot; Muwashshaḥs &quot;from Spain&quot;. Stern&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;kharjas&quot; in Hebrew texts made them accessible to Romanists and had a great impact on the Spanish establishment and scholars of Romance in the West.

Emilio García Gómez and Josep M. Solà-Solé compiled collections of &quot;kharjas.&quot; Gómez&#x27;s 1965 book presented a corpus of all known &quot;kharjas&quot; at the time; although it did not include annotation or scholarly apparatus, it became canonical. Solà-Solé&#x27;s offered a complete scholarly apparatus, variations taken from different manuscripts, thorough discussion, and thoughtful speculation.

LP Harvey, Alan Jones, and James T. Monroe have also made influential contributions to the study of the &quot;kharjas&quot;.

<text>Charles Lincoln Van Doren (February 12, 1926 – April 9, 2019) was an American writer and editor who was involved in a television quiz show scandal in the 1950s. In 1959 he testified before the United States Congress that he had been given the correct answers by the producers of the NBC quiz show &quot;Twenty-One&quot;. Terminated by NBC, he joined Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. in 1959, becoming a vice-president and writing and editing many books before retiring in 1982.

==Background==

Charles Van Doren was born in New York City, the elder son of Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, critic and professor Mark Van Doren and novelist Dorothy Van Doren (née Graffe), and a nephew of critic and Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Carl Van Doren. He graduated from the High School of Music &amp; Art in New York, and earned a B.A. degree in Liberal Arts (1946) from St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, Maryland, as well as an M.A. in astrophysics (1949) and a Ph.D. in English (1955), both at Columbia University. He was also a student at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.

==Quiz show celebrity==

On November 28, 1956, Van Doren made his first appearance on the NBC quiz show &quot;Twenty-One&quot;. &quot;Twenty-One&quot; was not Van Doren&#x27;s first game show interest. He was long believed to have approached producers Dan Enright and Albert Freedman, originally, to appear on &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot;, another game they produced. Van Doren eventually revealed—five decades after his &quot;Twenty-One&quot; championship and fame, in a surprise 2008 article for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;—that he did not even own a television set, but had met Freedman through a mutual friend, with Freedman initiating the idea of Van Doren going on television by way of asking what he thought of &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot;.

Enright and Freedman were impressed by Van Doren&#x27;s polite style and telegenic appearance, thinking the youthful Columbia teacher would be the man to defeat their incumbent &quot;Twenty-One&quot; champion, Herb Stempel, and boost the show&#x27;s declining ratings as Stempel&#x27;s reign continued.

In January 1957, Van Doren entered a winning streak on &quot;Twenty-One&quot; that ultimately earned him $129,000 (the equivalent of $ million today) and made him famous, including an appearance on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on February 11, 1957. His run ended on March 11, when he lost to Vivienne Nearing, a lawyer whose husband Van Doren had previously defeated. After his defeat he was offered a three-year contract with NBC worth $150,000.

There have been numerous suggestions since that Van Doren was almost immediately offered a job as a special &quot;cultural correspondent&quot; for &quot;Today&quot;, hosted by Dave Garroway. However, Van Doren reminded people that his first job (though short-lived) was as a newswriter, before he began doing small pieces for a weekend cultural program, &quot;Wide Wide World&quot;, also hosted by Garroway. Those pieces quickly led to Garroway inviting Van Doren to join &quot;Today&quot;. Van Doren also made guest appearances on other NBC programs, even serving as &quot;Today&quot;″s substitute host when Garroway took a brief vacation.

===Scandal===

When allegations of cheating were first raised by Stempel and others, Van Doren denied any wrongdoing, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s silly and distressing to think that people don&#x27;t have more faith in quiz shows.&quot; As the investigation by the New York District Attorney&#x27;s office and eventually the United States Congress progressed, Van Doren, now host on &quot;Today&quot;, was under pressure from NBC to testify. Instead, Van Doren went into hiding in order to avoid the congressional subpoena. It was another former &quot;Twenty-One&quot; contestant, artist James Snodgrass, who would finally provide indisputable corroborating proof that the show had been rigged. Snodgrass had documented every answer he was coached on in a series of registered letters he mailed to himself prior to the broadcast.

One month after the hearings began, Van Doren emerged from hiding and confessed before Congress that he had been complicit in the fraud. On November 2, 1959, he admitted to the House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight, a congressional subcommittee chaired by Rep. Oren Harris (D-AR), that he had been given questions and answers in advance of the show.

Authorities differ regarding the audience&#x27;s reaction to Van Doren&#x27;s statement. David Halberstam writes in his book &quot;The Fifties&quot;:

By contrast, William Manchester, in his narrative history &quot;The Glory and the Dream&quot;, recounts a diametrically opposite response:

An Associated Press story dated November 2, 1959, seems to verify Halberstam&#x27;s version of events:

==Later career and death==
Van Doren was dropped by NBC and resigned from his post as an English instructor at Columbia University. He became an editor at Praeger Books and a pseudonymous (at first) writer, before becoming an editor of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and the author of several books, of which his 1991 popular-market &quot;A History of Knowledge&quot; may be his best known. Van Doren also co-authored a well-received revision of &quot;How to Read a Book&quot; with its original author, philosopher Mortimer J. Adler, and co-edited with him a 1,771-page anthology titled &quot;Great Treasury of Western Thought&quot; (1977). He had already worked with Adler on an 18-volume collection of documents covering American history, entitled &quot;The Annals of America&quot; (1968), which was accompanied by a two-volume, 1,300-page &quot;topical index&quot; organized around 25 themes and entitled &quot;Great Issues in American Life: A Conspectus&quot;.

In his 2008 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Van Doren revealed that he had actually been contemplating the &quot;Britannica&quot; job even at the height of his celebrity. His father had suggested the possibility to him during a long walk around the farmlands they both loved. The elder Van Doren mentioned to his son that Adler, the philosopher and a member of &quot;Britannica&quot;″s board of editors, had spoken of making Van Doren its editor-in-chief. Van Doren eventually accepted the job, he would write, by way of intercession from a former college roommate. Van Doren retired from &quot;Britannica&quot; in 1982.

Van Doren also revealed he had been offered an opportunity to participate in a PBS series on the history of philosophy, but that its tentative producer, Julian Krainin, might actually have had in mind Van Doren&#x27;s explicit cooperation on a planned PBS program recalling the quiz show scandals. When that did not occur (though the program thanked Van Doren explicitly, among other credits), he wrote, Krainin later sought his cooperation and consultation when Robert Redford was beginning to make &quot;Quiz Show&quot;—even conveying that Van Doren would be paid in six figures for it. After wrestling with the idea—and, he wrote, noting his wife&#x27;s objections—Van Doren rejected it. Van Doren finally broke his silence on the quiz show scandal in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; article.

Van Doren had refused interviews or public comment on the subject of the quiz show scandals. In a 1985 interview on &quot;Today&quot;—his only appearance on the program since his dismissal in 1959, promoting his book &quot;The Joy of Reading&quot;—he answered a general question on how the scandal changed his life. He revisited Columbia University only twice in the forty years that followed his resignationin 1984 when his son John graduated; and in 1999 at a reunion of Columbia&#x27;s Class of 1959. During the latter appearance, Van Doren made one allusion to the quiz scandal without mentioning it by name:

In 2005, Van Doren joined the faculty of the University of Connecticut, Torrington; the campus was closed in 2016. Van Doren spent the last years of his life with his wife, Gerry, in a &quot;small, old house&quot; (his words) on the land his parents bought in Cornwall, Connecticut, in the 1920s.

Van Doren died in a retirement community of natural causes in Canaan, Connecticut, on April 9, 2019, at the age of 93. His opponent he defeated to win his first game of &quot;Twenty One&quot;, Herb Stempel died on April 7, 2020, almost exactly one year after Van Doren&#x27;s death, and at the same age; Stempel&#x27;s death was not publicly announced until nearly two months later.

==Cultural references==
===&quot;The Quiz Show Scandal&quot;===
&quot;The Quiz Show Scandal&quot; is a documentary that first aired on PBS on January 6, 1992, as an episode of the fourth season of &quot;American Experience&quot;. Produced by Julian Krainin and Michael R. Lawrence, the one-hour program explored the corruption of the 1950s quiz show scandals, particularly that involving Van Doren and &quot;Twenty-One&quot;. Van Doren spoke with the producers but eventually declined to participate in the program. &quot;The Quiz Show Scandal&quot; was one of the most popular episodes of the series.

===&quot;Quiz Show&quot; film===
The story of the quiz show scandal and Van Doren&#x27;s role in it is depicted in the 1994 film &quot;Quiz Show&quot;, produced and directed by Robert Redford, in which Van Doren is portrayed by Ralph Fiennes. The film made $24 million by April 1995, and was nominated for Academy Awards in the categories of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and Best Adapted Screenplay.

The film earned several critiques questioning its use of dramatic license, its accuracy, and the motivation behind its making. The movie&#x27;s critics have included Joseph Stone, the New York prosecutor who began the investigations; and Jeffrey Hart, a Dartmouth College scholar and senior editor of &quot;National Review&quot;; and a longtime friend of Van Doren, who saw the film as falsely implying tension between Van Doren and his accomplished father.

===&quot;Freedomland U.S.A.: The Definitive History&quot;===
Van Doren is mentioned in a book, &quot;Freedomland U.S.A.: The Definitive History&quot; (Theme Park Press, 2019), that references his connection to the now-defunct Freedomland U.S.A. theme park that was located in The Bronx in New York City. He was the master of ceremonies for the groundbreaking event for the park on August 26, 1959.

===&quot;Rigged on a Fix&quot;===
Charles Van Doren and 1950s quiz show scandals were referenced in the track &quot;Rigged on a Fix&quot; from the self-titled album &quot;Rancid&quot; by the American punk rock band Rancid.

====&quot;All the Answers&quot;====
The July 28, 2008, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; included a personal reminiscence titled &quot;All the Answers&quot;, written by Van Doren, in which he recounted in detail the scandals and their aftermath. Other than very occasional and often very abbreviated references to it, Van Doren had never before spoken publicly about the scandal, his role, and its effects on his life.

He referred to the film &quot;Quiz Show&quot;, saying he was bothered most by the closing credits&#x27; reference that he never taught again: &quot;I didn&#x27;t stop teaching, though it was a long time before I taught again in a college.&quot; But he also said he enjoyed John Turturro&#x27;s portrayal of his &quot;Twenty-One&quot; rival, Herb Stempel.

The article also contradicted many impressions of Van Doren that the film had created: the film portrayed him as a bachelor when he was actually engaged; it suggested he had a fascination with the burgeoning, popular television quiz shows when in fact he did not even own a television set; that the only reason he became even mildly acquainted with &quot;Twenty-One&quot; was because co-producer Al Freedman shared a mutual acquaintance with one of Van Doren&#x27;s friends; and that he had been offered his job with &quot;Today&quot; promptly after losing to Vivien Nearing when, in fact, NBC was not sure at first what to do with him, until he did work for Dave Garroway&#x27;s Sunday afternoon cultural show, &quot;Wide Wide World&quot;, which &quot;then&quot; led to the invitation to join &quot;Today&quot;.

Van Doren also addressed and denied the film&#x27;s insinuations that he had been friends with Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin while Van Doren was &quot;Twenty-One&quot;″s reigning champion (and during and after the start of Herb Stempel&#x27;s efforts to expose the show&#x27;s being rigged). According to Van Doren, the two men had not met until August 1959, when the subcommittee Goodwin served as counsel for had begun investigating the quiz shows and Van Doren was already established on &quot;The Today Show.&quot;

<text>Jennifer Maria Capriati (born March 29, 1976) is an American former professional tennis player. She was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) for 17 weeks. Capriati won 14 WTA Tour-level singles titles, including three majors at the 2001 Australian Open, 2001 French Open, and 2002 Australian Open, and an Olympic gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.

Capriati set a number of youngest-ever records. She made her professional debut in 1990 at the age of 13 years, 11 months, reaching the final of the Boca Raton tournament. She reached the semifinals of the 1990 French Open on her debut and later became the youngest-ever player to reach the top 10, at age 14 years, 235 days, in October of that year. Following a first-round loss at the 1993 US Open, she took a 14-month break from professional tennis. Her personal struggles during this time (including arrests for shoplifting and possession of marijuana) were well documented by the press.

In 1998, Capriati won her first major-level singles match in five years at Wimbledon. During the next two years, she slowly returned to championship form, winning her first title in six years in Strasbourg in 1999 and regaining a top-20 ranking. At the 2001 Australian Open, the reinvigorated Capriati became the lowest seed ever to win the championship when she defeated Martina Hingis in straight sets for her first Grand Slam championship. She also won the French Open that year, claiming the WTA No. 1 ranking in October. After successfully defending her Australian Open title in 2002, she became a top-10 mainstay until injuries derailed her career in 2004. Capriati was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Career==
===1990–1991: The records===
Capriati won the Junior Orange Bowl in both the 12- and the 14-year categories, and is one of only nine tennis players to win the Junior Orange Bowl Championship twice in its 70-year history, which list includes Andy Murray, Jimmy Connors, Monica Seles, and Yishai Oliel.

Capriati made her professional debut as a 13-year-old, reaching the finals of two of her first three pro events, losing to Gabriela Sabatini and Martina Navratilova in the Boca Raton and Hilton Head tournaments, respectively, earning her first two wins over top-10 players (No. 10 Helena Suková and number-five Arantxa Sánchez Vicario). She entered the rankings in April, at No. 23. Capriati made her Grand Slam debut at the French Open. She went all the way to the semifinals, losing to eventual champion Monica Seles. She then reached the fourth round at Wimbledon, losing to Steffi Graf. Later in the year Capriati won her first career title in Puerto Rico, defeating Zina Garrison. After this victory Capriati entered the world&#x27;s top 10. She qualified for the WTA Championships, narrowly losing to Graf in the first round in three sets. She finished her first season as a professional at world No. 8.

Throughout the season Capriati set multiple &quot;youngest ever&quot; records. She was the youngest player to reach a tour final, the youngest player to reach the semifinals at the French Open, the youngest seed ever at Wimbledon, and the youngest player to qualify for the season-ending championships. She was also the fourth-youngest player to win a WTA Tour title. She was named the WTA Newcomer of the Year for 1990.

In her second season as a touring pro, Capriati established herself as a consistent top-10 player. She won two singles titles during the summer hard court circuit, defeating world No. 1, Monica Seles, in a third set tie-breaker in final of San Diego, and Katerina Maleeva in straight sets in the final of Toronto. She also reached two Grand Slam semifinals, at Wimbledon and the US Open. At Wimbledon, the 15-year-old Capriati stunned nine-time champion Martina Navratilova, defeating her in the quarterfinals in straight sets. Capriati became the youngest person to ever reach the semifinal round of the tournament, losing to Sabatini. At the US Open, Capriati defeated Sabatini in the quarters but lost in the semis to eventual champion Seles in a third-set tiebreak after serving for the match twice. Capriati qualified for the year-end championships for the second time, reaching the quarterfinals. She ended the year at No. 6.

Capriati also won the only doubles title of her career at the Italian Open, partnering with Seles.

===1992–1993: Continued success, Olympic gold medal===
Capriati&#x27;s 1992 season was highlighted by her victory at the Summer Olympics. She defeated second-seeded Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the semifinals and came from a set down to defeat top-seeded Steffi Graf in the gold-medal match. Capriati next defended her title in San Diego, defeating Conchita Martínez in the final, the only time that Capriati won back-to-back singles titles during her career. She reached the quarter-finals at the Australian Open (in her debut), at the French Open, and at Wimbledon, and then she lost in the third round at the US Open. In Miami, Capriati ended Monica Seles&#x27;s streak of 21 consecutive finals by defeating her in the quarterfinals. Capriati finished the year ranked in the top 10 for the third straight year, at No. 7. She also became the youngest player to surpass $1 million in prize money (Martina Hingis later broke this record). Also in 1992, a Sega Genesis video game titled &quot;Jennifer Capriati Tennis&quot; was released by Renovation Products.

At her first tournament (Sydney 1993), Capriati defeated third-ranked Sabatini in the semifinals before defeating Anke Huber in the final. For the second straight year, she reached the quarterfinals at the first three majors of the year. She reached the final of the Rogers Cup in Montreal, losing to Steffi Graf. At the US Open, the seventh-seeded Capriati lost her opening match to former top 15-player Leila Meskhi, her first loss in the first round of any pro tournament. Following this loss, Capriati decided to take a break from tennis. She finished the year ranked ninth.

===1994–95: Break from tour===
Capriati only played one match in 1994, losing in the first round of Philadelphia to Anke Huber. She fell off the rankings in June. She did not play at all in 1995.

===1996: Return===
Capriati, unranked, played her first match in 15 months in Essen, where she reached the quarterfinals, losing to Jana Novotná in three sets. She reached her first final in more than three years at Chicago, defeating Monica Seles en route, before losing again to Novotná in three sets. Capriati also reached the quarters in the fall at the Zurich Open, defeating Sabatini in the opening round in what was the last singles match of Sabatini&#x27;s career. Capriati competed in her first Grand Slam tournaments since 1993 at the French Open and the US Open, losing in the first round of both. Capriati re-appeared on the rankings in April at No. 103, and finished the year inside the top 25, at No. 24. She was named the WTA Comeback Player of the Year for 1996.

===1997–98: Descent in the rankings===
In January 1997, Capriati reached the final in Sydney for the second time in her career, defeating world No. 9, Lindsay Davenport, en route to her only top-10 win of the year, losing to Martina Hingis in the final. She only reached the quarterfinals at one other tournament, Oklahoma City, where she lost to Davenport. Capriati finished the year at No. 66, losing her final six matches in 1997.

Capriati did not play the first half of 1998. By the spring, she was ranked below the top 200. She accepted a wildcard entry into the clay-court tournament in Hamburg, Germany, where she reached the quarterfinals, but then lost to Martina Hingis. Capriati was also a quarterfinalist in Palermo, Italy. In the first round at Wimbledon, Capriati won her first Grand Slam singles match in five years, before losing to Lori McNeil in the second round. Capriati finished 1998 ranked 101.

===1999–2000: Ascent===
1999 was Capriati&#x27;s best season in several years. She won her first title in six years at Strasbourg, defeating ninth ranked Nathalie Tauziat in a quarterfinal for her first win over a top-10 player in two years. She defeated Russian Elena Likhovtseva in the final. She won her second title of the year at Quebec City, defeating American Chanda Rubin in the final. She also reached the round of 16 at both Roland Garros and US Open. She finished the year at No. 23.

At the 2000 Australian Open, Capriati reached her first Grand Slam semifinal in nine years before losing to eventual champion Lindsay Davenport in straight sets.

At the Miami Open, Capriati defeated world No. 6, Serena Williams, for her first win over a player ranked in the top six in four years en route to a quarterfinal finish. Shortly after, Capriati was sidelined with right Achilles tendonitis in April and an elbow injury in June.

Capriati had a strong fall season, winning her ninth career title at Luxembourg, defeating Magdalena Maleeva. She also finished runner up in Quebec City to Chanda Rubin and was a semifinalist in Zürich. These results propelled Capriati back into the top 20 for the first time since April 1994. She qualified for the season-ending championships for the first time in seven years. Her year-end ranking was 14, her highest in seven years. Capriati was also a member of the United States Fed Cup team, winning a singles and doubles rubber in the U.S.&#x27; victory over Spain in the final.

===2001: Grand Slam champion and world No. 1===
Capriati was seeded 12th at the Australian Open. She rallied from a set and a break down to defeat Monica Seles to reach the semis for the second consecutive year, beating world No. 2 Davenport. In her first Grand Slam final, she defeated top seed and world No. 1, Martina Hingis, in straight sets to win her first Grand Slam singles title. She was the lowest seed to ever win the title, and also the first player since Tracy Austin in 1979 to defeat the top two ranked players in straight sets at a major. As a result of this triumph, Capriati re-entered the top 10 in the rankings at No. 7, the longest absence (nearly eight years) from the top 10 in WTA history.

Capriati then reached the finals of the Cellular Cup in Oklahoma City, losing to Seles. After electing not to participate in the Indian Wells Open, Capriati reached the final in Miami, losing to Venus Williams after having failed to convert on eight championship points.

Capriati then embarked on a remarkably successful clay court campaign. She won her second title of the year at the Family Circle Cup in Charleston, South Carolina, defeating Hingis in three sets in the final. She then lost in the final of Berlin to Amélie Mauresmo, also in three sets. Seeded fourth at the French Open, Capriati defeated top seed Hingis in the semifinals and the 12th seeded Kim Clijsters in the final to win her second consecutive Grand Slam title. Her 1–6, 6–4, 12–10 win over Clijsters had the longest-ever third set in a women&#x27;s final in the French Open; four times in the match, Capriati was two points away from being defeated. She was only the fifth woman in history to win the Australian Open and the French Open consecutively.

At Wimbledon, Capriati rallied from 7–6, 5–3, 30–0 down in the quarterfinals to defeat Serena Williams. Capriati&#x27;s 19-match Grand Slam win streak ended in the semis at the hands of eighth seeded Justine Henin. Capriati rebounded at the Rogers Cup in Toronto, making it to the final before losing to Serena Williams after saving match point in the second set. Capriati then lost in the semifinals of the US Open to Venus Williams. Despite the loss, Capriati accumulated the best Grand Slam record of 2001, and she was the only player to reach at least the semifinals of all four of the Grand Slam tournaments.

Despite playing very little in the fall, Capriati became ranked world No. 1 on October 15. She lost her opening match at the WTA Tour Championships to Maleeva. Capriati would have finished the year ranked No. 1 if she had reached the semifinals. Instead, she finished No. 2, behind Lindsay Davenport, with a 56–14 record. She was named the ITF World Champion, WTA Player of the Year, and Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year for 2001.

===2002: Third Grand Slam title===
As a result of Davenport&#x27;s withdrawal from the Australian Open due to an injury, Capriati was the top seed. She defeated the sixth-seeded Amélie Mauresmo and the fourth-seeded Kim Clijsters en route to her second consecutive final there, where she once again faced Martina Hingis. The match was played in very hot conditions, with the temperature exceeding 35 degrees Celsius. Capriati fought back from 6–4, 4–0 down and four championship points to eventually prevail 4–6, 7–6(9–7), 6–2. This was Capriati&#x27;s third and final Grand Slam title.

In the spring, Capriati reached finals in Scottsdale and Miami losing to Serena Williams on both occasions. Capriati prepared for her French Open title defense by participating in events in Charleston, Berlin, and Rome, losing in the semifinals of all three. As the top seed at the French Open, Capriati reached the semifinals—before losing to the eventual champion Serena Williams in three sets. Capriati surrendered her No. 1 ranking to Venus Williams as a result of this loss. Capriati&#x27;s streak of six consecutive Grand Slam semifinals was broken at Wimbledon, where she lost to Amélie Mauresmo in three sets in the quarterfinals. She also lost to Mauresmo in the finals of the Canadian Open, and in the quarterfinals of the US Open after having served for the match.

Capriati won only one match in the three European indoor events she played. She rebounded at the year-ending championships, reaching the semifinals for the first time, losing to Serena Williams. Capriati finished the year ranked third.

===2003: New Haven champion===
A week after the 2002 WTA Championships, Capriati had eye surgery in order to remove pterygiums (sun spots) from both eyes. Recovery from the surgery hampered Capriati&#x27;s off-season preparation.

In the opening round of the 2003 Australian Open Capriati lost to unseeded and unheralded Marlene Weingärtner. Capriati was the first Australian Open title-holder to lose in the first round. She withdrew from the Pan Pacific Open to further recover from her surgery.

Capriati rebounded by reaching at least semifinals of the next five tournaments she played. She lost to Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals of the Indian Wells tournament. She then reached the final of the Miami Open for the third consecutive year before losing to world No. 1, Serena Williams. Capriati lost in the round of 16 of the French Open to unseeded Nadia Petrova. She reached the quarters of Wimbledon for the sixth time, losing to Serena Williams in three sets, her eighth consecutive loss to her compatriot.

Capriati then reached her second final of 2003 in Stanford, losing to Kim Clijsters in three sets. A pectoral strain forced Capriati to retire from her opening match in San Diego and pull out of Montreal. Capriati won her first title of 2003 in New Haven after Davenport retired in the final while trailing. This ended a 28-tournament title drought for Capriati, and was her first tour victory since she won the 2002 Australian Open. Seeded sixth at the US Open, Capriati reached the semifinal where she lost to second-seeded Justine Henin in a tight third-set tiebreak many experts believed she should have won. Capriati served for the match twice and was two points away from victory eleven times, but Henin prevailed in a three-hour marathon, despite Henin&#x27;s serve being visibly affected by muscle cramps in her left leg throughout much of the last half hour of the match.

Capriati did not play again until the WTA Tour Championships when she lost in the semifinal to Justine Henin again, now the world No. 1.

===2004: Final full season===
Injuries plagued Capriati&#x27;s 2004 season. A back injury suffered during the 2003 WTA Tour Championships forced Capriati to withdraw from the 2004 Australian Open and the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo. Capriati advanced beyond the quarterfinals just once in her first four events of the year in Doha, losing to Anastasia Myskina in the semifinals. Her back continued to be an issue, forcing her out of Indian Wells and Miami. Her ranking dropped to No. 10 as a result of her injuries.

Capriati produced her best results of the year during the European clay-court season. She reached the semis of Berlin, defeating world No. 5 Myskina in the quarterfinals for her first top-5 win of the season, before losing to Mauresmo in the semifinals. At the Italian Open, Capriati defeated top seed Serena Williams in the quarterfinals, her first win over the American since Wimbledon 2001. Capriati moved on to the final, where she lost to Mauresmo in a three-hour struggle. Seeded seventh at the French Open, Capriati went on to the semifinals, before losing to sixth seeded and eventual champion Myskina in straight sets.

At Wimbledon, Capriati reached the quarters for the fourth straight year, where she lost to Serena Williams in 45 minutes, the most lopsided result of their 17-match rivalry. A hamstring injury forced her to withdraw from Los Angeles and San Diego, but she reached the quarterfinals of both Montreal and New Haven. Seeded eighth at the US Open, Capriati defeated Williams in a controversial line call quarterfinal match by the chair umpire, Mariana Alves, to reach her fourth US Open semifinal. The call was shown repeatedly on TV via video replay to be clearly wrong, which had renewed calls and subsequently successful implementation of line-call technology such as MacCam and then Hawk-Eye. Capriati then lost to fifth seed Elena Dementieva in the last four in yet another, her third, tight US Open semifinal tiebreak, replicating the result in the tournament from the year before.

Capriati had reached the semifinals of the US Open four times in her career (1991, 2001, 2003 and 2004), losing to a different opponent each time. Three of those times (1991, 2003 and 2004), she had lost in tough third-set tiebreaks, and two of those three opponents (Seles in 1991, and Henin in 2003) had then gone on to win the final and US Open championships easily in straight sets thereafter.

Following the US Open, Capriati lost in the quarterfinals of Philadelphia to world No. 11, Vera Zvonareva, her worst loss since 1999 (where she won only one game against Graf in Miami). Capriati failed to qualify for the season-ending championships for the first time since 1999 and finished the year world No. 10.

==Playing style==

Capriati was one of the first power players to emerge on the women&#x27;s circuit in the early-to-mid-1990s, along with Monica Seles, Lindsay Davenport, and Mary Pierce. Her style of play was characterized by taking the ball early and on the rise, powerful ground-strokes, and an aggressive mindset on the return of service.

Capriati&#x27;s game was built around her groundstrokes and movement. Her flat forehand, devastating when hit hard, was considered her biggest weapon, especially when she was stretched out wide. She also possessed a solid backhand. She was quick around the court, able to play defense as well as offense. Her biggest weakness was considered to be her serve. Her first serve was powerful but offset by a wandering ball-toss which often was thrown too far right, and her second serve was considered to be the most vulnerable part of her game. However, Capriati was known to counter her inconsistent serve with her exceptional return of serve.

==Equipment and endorsements==
In the 1990s, she signed a reported $3 million contract with Diadora, and a $1 million contract with Prince tennis rackets. In the early 2000s, her tennis court apparel line was manufactured by Fila. She used a Prince Precision Retro 27 Midplus racket.

==Legacy and accolades==
Capriati was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2012 at the age of just 36, and is generally considered one of the best tennis players of her generation and one of the best Grand Slam performers of her time frequently getting to the latter stages. A video game titled &quot;Jennifer Capriati Tennis&quot; was released for the Sega Genesis in 1992. In 2001, ESPN named Capriati one of the world&#x27;s sexiest athletes. She was awarded with the Laureus World Sports Award for Comeback of the Year in 2001 and Laureus World Sports Award for Sportswoman of the Year in 2002.

==Post-tennis endeavors==
In April 2009, the media announced that Capriati would appear on the television reality series &quot;The Superstars&quot;. The show, described as a revival of the 1970s series of the same name, premiered on June 23, 2009, in a co-ed format, with Capriati paired with singer and actor David Charvet, best known for his role as a lifeguard on the television show &quot;Baywatch&quot;. In the first episode of the show, they were one of the lower-performing teams and were sent into a run-off in an obstacle course race against basketball player Lisa Leslie and actor Dan Cortese. Capriati/Charvet won their race and avoided elimination. She withdrew from the contest after re-aggravating a previous injury.

==Personal life==
Capriati was born in New York City to Denise and Stefano Capriati, of Italian descent. In 1993, at age 17, Capriati was charged with shoplifting a $15 ring from a mall kiosk, which she has described as accidental.

She was arrested on May 16, 1994, and charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession. She agreed to enter a drug counselling program. In 2010, she required treatment for a drug overdose. In 2013, Capriati was charged with battery and stalking after reportedly following and striking former boyfriend Ivan Brennan on Valentine&#x27;s Day. The charges were later dropped. In 2014, the state attorney&#x27;s office in Palm Beach County, Florida, announced that Capriati had completed 30 hours of community service and four hours of anger management counseling in connection with the incident.

<doc id="325057" wikidata="Q5164228" url="?curid=325057" title="Constitution of Puerto Rico">
<text>The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico () is the primary organizing law for the unincorporated U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, describing the duties, powers, structures and functions of the government of Puerto Rico in nine articles. It was ratified by the electorate of the archipelago and island in a referendum on March 3, 1952 and proclaimed into effect by Governor Luis Muñoz Marín on July 25, 1952, celebrated as Constitution Day. As the constitution of a territory of the United States, it is bound by the Constitution of the United States.

Under the constitution, the unincorporated U.S. territory of Puerto Rico is neither a sovereign country nor a state of the United States. Puerto Rico is subject to the territorial sovereignty and federal government of the United States, which is responsible for the monetary policy, foreign relations, defense, among enumerated powers. The local government of Puerto Rico is responsible for education, law enforcement, elections, among other reserved powers. Both governments share concurrent powers, including taxation and fiscal policy. The political status of Puerto Rico is an ongoing debate. 

==History==
The United States government authorized Puerto Rico to draft its own constitution with the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950. The Constitutional Assembly met for a period of several months between 1951 and 1952 in which the document was written. The law required the framers to follow only two basic requirements: a republican form of government and inclusion of a Bill of Rights.

The proposed constitution was approved overwhelmingly by nearly 82% of the voters in a popular referendum on March 3, 1952. The United States Congress and the President approved it, but required that the Article II (Bill of Rights), Section 20 (guaranteeing the right to education and various economic rights) be stricken and that language be added to Section 5 of Article II allowing non-governmental schools. On July 10, 1952, the Constitutional Convention of Puerto Rico reconvened and approved a resolution accepting those conditions, which were later ratified in a referendum held in November 1952, by the electorate. On July 25, 1952, Governor Luis Muñoz Marín proclaimed that the constitution was in effect. In a speech on July 25, 2013, Governor Alejandro García Padilla, despite the conditions established by Congress, proclaimed that, henceforth, Sec. 20 would be deemed by his administration to be in effect.

In 1960, 1961, 1964 and 1970 voters approved amendments to the constitution in various referendums.

A continuing debate has dealt with the legal status of Puerto Rico under the Federal Government of the United States. Certain decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States appeared to have interpreted the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution as still controlling over Puerto Rico. Under this clause, the United States Congress is the recognized sovereign of the island.

In 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court clarified that the purpose of Congress in the 1950 and 1952 legislation was to accord to Puerto Rico the degree of autonomy and independence normally associated with a State of the Union. However, on June 9, 2016, as an outcome of the case known as &quot;Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court incited a debate regarding the nature of the relationship established by the 1950 and 1952 legislation, allegedly breaching the compact between the United States and the People of Puerto Rico. The debate was fueled when the Supreme Court decided that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars Puerto Rico and the United States from successively prosecuting a single person for the same conduct under equivalent criminal laws. The Supreme Court ruling stated that, at least in the cases related to criminal offenses, sovereignty of Puerto Rico ultimately resides in the United States Congress.
The argument made by the U.S. Supreme Court was interpreted by many as an affirmation of a severely diminished capacity of the constitutional stature that the Puerto Rican government had. This was the same idea of stature that the Puerto Rican government has had for nearly seven decades. Justice Elena Kagan stated that the ruling in the case of &#x27;Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle&#x27; was confined solely to the corresponding issue of double jeopardy within a criminal case, not to the whole of Puerto Rico&#x27;s political status. Still, the outcome fueled a debate regarding the current nature of the political relationship established between Puerto Rico and United States of America.

=== Proposed amendments ===
In 1994 and 2012 constitutional amendments were proposed but these were unsuccessful. In 2021 the PPD majority led by Tatito Hernández began a discussion over amending the constitution. The speaker of the House of Representatives proposed increasing the governor&#x27;s salary, replacing at large representatives by district elections and reducing the number of representatives from 51 to 45. Governor Pedro Pierluisi has favored term limits for legislators but has expressed opposition to proposals for the creation of a recall referendum.

==Founding fathers==

Twelve weeks after the people of Puerto Rico approved to write their own constitution in a referendum, 92 individuals were elected as delegates to a constitutional assembly on August 27, 1951. Of these, 70 belonged to the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), 15 belonged to the Republican Statehood Party, while 7 belonged to the Puerto Rican Socialist Party. Members from the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) abstained from participating. The following is a list of the delegates:

The delegates, which would eventually become the founding fathers of the current commonwealth of Puerto Rico, established 10 permanent committees: 7 which dealt with constitutional matters and 3 which dealt with the assembly&#x27;s internal operations. The constitutional committees were as follows:

The assembly held 62 sessions between September 17, 1951, and February 6, 1952, approving the constitution within the assembly two days before concluding their affairs on February 4, 1952. The constitution was then overwhelmingly approved a month later by the people of Puerto Rico in a referendum held on March 3, 1952.

==Preamble==

The Preamble reads:

:&quot;We, the people of Puerto Rico, in order to organize ourselves politically on a fully democratic basis, to promote the general welfare, and to secure for ourselves and our posterity the complete enjoyment of human rights, placing our trust in Almighty God, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the commonwealth which, in the exercise of our natural rights, we now create within our union with the .&quot;

:&quot;In so doing, we declare:&quot;

:&quot;The democratic system is fundamental to the life of the Puerto Rican community;&quot;

:&quot;We understand that the democratic system of government is one in which the will of the people is the source of public power, the political order is subordinate to the rights of man, and the free participation of the citizen in collective decisions is assured;&quot;

:&quot;We consider as determining factors in our life our citizenship of the United States of America and our aspiration continually to enrich our democratic heritage in the individual and collective enjoyment of its rights and privileges; our loyalty to the principles of the Federal Constitution; the co-existence in Puerto Rico of the two great cultures of the American Hemisphere; our fervor for education; our faith in justice; our devotion to the courageous, industrious, and peaceful way of life; our fidelity to individual human values above and beyond social position, racial differences, and economic interests; and our hope for a better world based on these principles.&quot;

The Preamble of the Constitution of Puerto Rico is more extensive than the Preamble to the United States Constitution. However, it has the similarity that the preamble neither grants any powers nor inhibits any actions; it only explains the rationale behind the Constitution. Yet, it specifically details the determining factors that the Puerto Rican people have chosen as the basis for their new government. It also establishes the Constitution&#x27;s loyalty to the &quot;principles&quot; of the Federal Constitution.

==Articles of the Constitution==
The remainder of the document consists of nine articles:

===Article One: The Commonwealth===
Article One establishes the new government for the unincorporated territory, which shall bear the name of &quot;Commonwealth of Puerto Rico&quot;. It declares that the source of the power of the government emanates from the people. The following three sections of the Article establish the Republican form of government of the unincorporated territory, divided into three branches (legislative, executive and judicial) and specifies the territorial jurisdiction of the document as well as the seat of the new government, which shall be the city of San Juan.

===Article Two: Bill of Rights===
Article Two of the Constitution of Puerto Rico—titled as the Bill of Rights ()— lists the most important rights held by the citizens of Puerto Rico. The Bill of Rights was mandated by which provided for the people of Puerto Rico to adopt a constitution of their own which had to include a bill of rights.

The bill enumerates several freedoms, namely freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, security in personal effects, and freedom from warrants issued without probable cause. It also establishes two fundamental declarations, that &quot;the dignity of the human being is inviolable&quot; and that all men are equal before the law. It also prohibits several discriminations, namely discrimination made on account of race, color, sex, birth, social origin or condition, or political or religious ideas. The bill even took a step further by declaring such principles as essential to human equality.

The Bill of Rights also establishes explicitly that there shall be complete separation of church and state, and that Puerto Rico must have a system of free and secular public education. It also establishes the right to vote, the right to life, and the right to liberty.

There are a number of variations that make the Puerto Rico Bill of Rights distinct from that of the Federal Bill of Rights. For instance in Puerto Rico they do not have the right to trial by jury but they do have direct protections against wiretapping.

In order to comply with the requirements of Public Law 600, the framers of the Constitution of Puerto Rico decided to draft an extensive list of rights which were then organized into a whole Article of the constitutional document. It is divided into nineteen sections, each one listing one or several rights which are deemed fundamental under Puerto Rican constitutional law.

Section One begins by establishing that &#x27;the dignity of the human being is inviolable&#x27; and that &#x27;all men are equal before the law.&#x27;. These two sentences have traditionally been interpreted by scholars as granting an unlimited number of rights, since anything that violates the dignity of a human being will be deemed unconstitutional. However, the remainder of the section concretely establishes the kinds of discriminations that are outlawed.

:&quot;No discrimination shall be made on account of race, color, sex, birth, social origin or condition, or political or religious ideas. Both the laws and the system of public education shall embody these principles of essential human equality.&quot;

Section Two establishes the right to vote in Puerto Rico;

:&quot;Section 2. The laws shall guarantee the expression of the will of the people by means of equal, direct and secret universal suffrage and shall protect the citizen against any coercion in the exercise of the electoral franchise.&quot;

Section Three is the religious clause of the Constitution of Puerto Rico. It prohibits the establishment of religion and protects the free exercise of religion. It reads;

:&quot;No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. There shall be complete separation of church and state.&quot;

The last sentence specifically and concretely establishes the separation of church and state, a clause that is not found in the United States&#x27; Constitution but, rather, it is assumed and interpreted to exist. Section three leaves no doubt about the existence of such separation in Puerto Rico.

Section Four is very similar to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. It establishes the freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and the right to petition. It reads;

:&quot;No law shall be made abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.&quot;

Section Five establishes the right to an education. It also mandates the establishment of a non-sectarian and free educational system for the commonwealth. The section also establishes that education will be compulsory for elementary school, &quot;to the extent permitted by the facilities of the state.&quot; The section further establishes that &quot;no public property or public funds shall be used for the support of schools or educational institutions other than those of the state.&quot;

Section Six declares the right of the people to organize themselves in associations, except if the associations are military or quasi-military in nature.

Section Seven contain several important fundamental rights. It reads;

:&quot; The right to life, liberty and the enjoyment of property is recognized as a fundamental right of man. The death penalty shall not exist. No person shall be deprived of his liberty or property without due process of law. No person in Puerto Rico shall be denied the equal protection of the laws. No laws impairing the obligation of contracts shall be enacted. A minimum amount of property and possessions shall be exempt from attachment as provided by law.&quot;

First, Section Seven establishes that the right to life is fundamental in Puerto Rico. Because of this, the section determines that the death penalty will not exist under the jurisdiction of the commonwealth.

Second, the section contains the due process of law as well as the equal protection clauses. Third, it includes a contract clause for the jurisdiction of the commonwealth. Finally, the sections guarantees that a minimum amount of the property owned by individuals will be exempt from government possession.

Section Eight declares that every person has the right to be protected by law against attacks on their honor, reputation and private or family life. This section has been interpreted as creating a general right to privacy in Puerto Rico.

Section Nine creates more liberties for the press. It establishes that:

:&quot;No law shall be enacted authorizing condemnation of printing presses, machinery or material devoted to publications of any kind. The buildings in which these objects are located may be condemned only after a judicial finding of public convenience and necessity pursuant to procedure that shall be provided by law, and may be taken before such a judicial finding only when there is placed at the disposition of the publication an adequate site in which it can be installed and continue to operate for a reasonable time.&quot;

Section Ten is similar to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It establishes that persons shall be protected against &quot;unreasonable searches and seizures&quot;. It explicitly prohibits the use of wire-tapping. Furthermore, it declares that no search warrant shall be issued unless probable cause is shown.

Section Eleven is primarily devoted to the rights of the accused.

:&quot;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to have a speedy and public trial, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation and to have a copy thereof, to be confronted with the witnesses against him, to have assistance of counsel, and to be presumed innocent.&quot;

It also establishes that in all trials of felony the accused shall enjoy of a jury of twelve peers who render a verdict by majority vote in which no less than nine shall concur. Also, the section creates the right against self-incrimination as well as the prohibition of double jeopardy.

Section Twelve outlaws slavery and involuntary servitude, unless duly convicted. It also prohibits ex post facto laws and bills of attainder.

Section Thirteen guarantees the writ of habeas corpus, which can only be suspended by the Legislative Assembly in time of &quot;rebellion, insurrection or invasion.&quot;

Section Fourteen prohibits the use of titles of nobility. It also prohibits public officials to receive gifts from foreign powers without the approval of the Legislative Assembly.

Section Fifteen deals with child labor. It prohibits the employment of children of less than fourteen years on jobs that may be &quot;prejudicial to their health or morals&quot;. It also guarantees that no children under the age of sixteen shall be kept in jail.

Section Seventeen creates the fundamental right of employees, private and public, to organize themselves into associations and to negotiate with their employers. Section Eighteen also declares a fundamental right for employers to go on strike. However, the section ends by stating; &quot;Nothing herein contained shall impair the authority of the Legislative Assembly to enact laws to deal with grave emergencies that clearly imperil the public health or safety or essential public services.&quot;

Section Nineteen is similar to the Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It reads;

:&quot;The foregoing enumeration of rights shall not be construed restrictively nor does it contemplate the exclusion of other rights not specifically mentioned which belong to the people in a democracy. The power of the Legislative Assembly to enact laws for the protection of the life, health and general welfare of the people shall likewise not be construed restrictively.&quot;

This section stresses out that the civil rights and liberties outlined in this Bill of Rights do not constitute an exclusive list thereof; others may exist. In other words, just because a civil right is not listed here, does not mean that the people do not have it. This is a safeguard against strict literal interpretations of the constitution with which the people will be denied all the rights not specifically listed here, such as a right to travel between districts at their own leisure (see propiska), or the right to travel abroad.

===Article Three: Legislative power===
The article establishes that the territorial legislature must be bicameral, and composed by the Senate as the upper house and the House of Representatives as the lower house. It also established the composition of each house, and that Puerto Rico must be divided into senatorial and representative districts for the purpose of elections.

The article also established a board that must revise the districts after each decennial census so that they remain practicable, and divided upon the basis of population and means of communication. It also established how the number of members of each house must increase when a political party obtains more than two thirds of the seats in one or both houses. This was done in order to reduce the likelihood of one party having absolute control over constitutional amendments, as these require at least two thirds of the vote of each house in order to be enacted.

Article Four was also very loose regarding the rules overseeing each house, establishing that each house must be the sole judge of the election, returns and qualifications of its members, that each house must choose its own officers, and that each house must adopt rules for its own proceedings appropriate to legislative bodies. This, in essence, gives broad powers to each house on how to structure itself and which procedures it must follow. It, however, established the posts of President of the Senate and Speaker of the House without any other specifics besides the title of the posts although interpretatively the article meant them to be the presiding officers of their respective house.

The article also established that the sessions of each house must be open, what constitutes quorum, and where should they meet, namely in the Capitol of Puerto Rico. It also granted parliamentary immunity to its members.

Article Four also established the parliamentary procedure to enact bills, namely that they must be printed, read, referred to a commission and returned therefrom with a written report, approved by the majority of which each house is composed, and signed by the governor in order to become law. The article also established the exclusive powers of each house, as well as establishing the post of Comptroller.

===Article Four: Executive Power===
Article Four describes the powers, structure, functions, responsibilities, and legal scope of the Governor of Puerto Rico, the executive branch of the government of Puerto Rico. The article establishes the term length of the governor and the requirements to hold such post, as well as establishing the governor as commander-in-chief of the militia, namely the Puerto Rico National Guard. It also establishes that the governor must present a State of the State address to the Legislative Assembly each year, as well as a report on the Budget of the Government of Puerto Rico.

The article also establishes the Council of Secretaries, and that all secretaries must be appointed with the advice and consent from the Senate of Puerto Rico, except for the Secretary of State which requires the advice and consent of the House of Representatives as well.

Article Four also established several executive departments, namely the departments of Agriculture and Commerce, Education, Health, Justice, Labor, State, Public Works, and Treasury. The Department of Agriculture and Commerce was later renamed to the Department of Agriculture, while several decades later the Department of Commerce and Economic Development was created by extraconstitutional law.

The article also established the first steps towards the Puerto Rico governmental line of succession, establishing the Secretary of State as first in line of succession.

===Article Five: Judicial Power===
Article Five describes the powers, structure, functions, responsibilities, and legal scope of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, the judicial branch of the government of Puerto Rico. The article also establishes that the Supreme Court must be the court of last resort, and that it must be composed by a Chief Justice and several Associate Justices. It also establishes that judges must be appointed by the Governor of Puerto Rico with the advice and consent from the Senate of Puerto Rico.

===Article Six: General Provisions===
Article Six authorizes the Legislative Assembly to create, abolish, consolidate and reorganize municipalities; to change their territorial limits; to determine their organization and functions; and to authorize them to develop programs for the general welfare and to create any agencies necessary for that purpose. It also authorizes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to impose and collect taxes and to authorize their imposition and collection by municipalities, as determined by the Legislative Assembly.

===Article Seven: Amendments to the Constitution===
Article 7 established the rules to perform amendments to the constitution, the Legislative Assembly may propose amendments to this Constitution by a concurrent resolution approved by not less than two-thirds of the total number of members of which each house is composed. All proposed amendments shall be submitted to the qualified electors in a special referendum, but if the concurrent resolution is approved by not less than three-fourths of the total number of members of which each house is composed, the Legislative Assembly may provide that the referendum shall be held at the same time as the next general election. Each proposed amendment shall be voted on separately and not more than three proposed amendments may be submitted at the same referendum. Every proposed amendment shall specify the terms under which it shall take effect, and it shall become a part of this Constitution if it is ratified by a majority of the electors voting thereon.

The section 3 indicates that no amendment to this Constitution shall alter the republican form of government established by it or abolish its bill of rights.*

* By Resolution number 34, approved by the Constitutional Convention and ratified in the Referendum held on November 4, 1952, the following new sentence was added to section 3 of article VII: &quot;Any amendment or revision of this constitution shall be consistent with the resolution enacted by the applicable provisions of the Constitution of the United States, with the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and with Public Law 600, Eighty-first Congress, adopted in the nature of a compact&quot;.

<doc id="325060" wikidata="Q184037" url="?curid=325060" title="Tidal power">
<text>Tidal power or tidal energy is harnessed by converting energy from tides into useful forms of power, mainly electricity using various methods.

Although not yet widely used, tidal energy has the potential for future electricity generation. Tides are more predictable than the wind and the sun. Among sources of renewable energy, tidal energy has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal ranges or flow velocities, thus constricting its total availability. However many recent technological developments and improvements, both in design (e.g. dynamic tidal power, tidal lagoons) and turbine technology (e.g. new axial turbines, cross flow turbines), indicate that the total availability of tidal power may be much higher than previously assumed and that economic and environmental costs may be brought down to competitive levels.

Historically, tide mills have been used both in Europe and on the Atlantic coast of North America. Incoming water was contained in large storage ponds, and as the tide goes out, it turns waterwheels that use the mechanical power to mill grain. The earliest occurrences date from the Middle Ages, or even from Roman times. The process of using falling water and spinning turbines to create electricity was introduced in the U.S. and Europe in the 19th century.

Electricity generation from marine technologies increased an estimated 16% in 2018, and an estimated 13% in 2019. Policies promoting R&amp;D are needed to achieve further cost reductions and large-scale development. The world&#x27;s first large-scale tidal power plant was France&#x27;s Rance Tidal Power Station, which became operational in 1966. It was the largest tidal power station in terms of output until Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station opened in South Korea in August 2011. The Sihwa station uses sea wall defense barriers complete with 10 turbines generating 254 MW.

== Principle ==

Tidal energy is taken from the Earth&#x27;s oceanic tides. Tidal forces result from periodic variations in gravitational attraction exerted by celestial bodies. These forces create corresponding motions or currents in the world&#x27;s oceans. This results in periodic changes in sea levels, varying as the Earth rotates. These changes are highly regular and predictable, due to the consistent pattern of the Earth&#x27;s rotation and the Moon&#x27;s orbit around the Earth. The magnitude and variations of this motion reflect the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth, the effects of Earth&#x27;s rotation, and local geography of the seafloor and coastlines.

Tidal power is the only technology that draws on energy inherent in the orbital characteristics of the Earth–Moon system, and to a lesser extent in the Earth–Sun system. Other natural energies exploited by human technology originate directly or indirectly from the Sun, including fossil fuel, conventional hydroelectric, wind, biofuel, wave and solar energy. Nuclear energy makes use of Earth&#x27;s mineral deposits of fissionable elements, while geothermal power utilizes the Earth&#x27;s internal heat, which comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%).

A tidal generator converts the energy of tidal flows into electricity. Greater tidal variation and higher tidal current velocities can dramatically increase the potential of a site for tidal electricity generation. On the other hand, tidal energy has high reliability, excellent energy density, and high durability.

Because the Earth&#x27;s tides are ultimately due to gravitational interaction with the Moon and Sun and the Earth&#x27;s rotation, tidal power is practically inexhaustible, and is thus classified as a renewable energy resource. Movement of tides causes a loss of mechanical energy in the Earth-Moon system: this results from pumping of water through natural restrictions around coastlines and consequent viscous dissipation at the seabed and in turbulence. This loss of energy has caused the rotation of the Earth to slow in the 4.5 billion years since its formation. During the last 620 million years the period of rotation of the Earth (length of a day) has increased from 21.9 hours to 24 hours; in this period the Earth-Moon system has lost 17% of its rotational energy. While tidal power will take additional energy from the system, the effect is negligible and would not be noticeable in the foreseeable future.

== Methods ==

Tidal power can be classified into four generating methods:

=== Tidal stream generator ===
Tidal stream generators make use of the kinetic energy of moving water to power turbines, in a similar way to wind turbines that use the wind to power turbines. Some tidal generators can be built into the structures of existing bridges or are entirely submersed, thus avoiding concerns over aesthetics or visual impact. Land constrictions such as straits or inlets can create high velocities at specific sites, which can be captured using turbines. These turbines can be horizontal, vertical, open, or ducted.

=== Tidal barrage ===
Tidal barrages use potential energy in the difference in height (or hydraulic head) between high and low tides. When using tidal barrages to generate power, the potential energy from a tide is seized through the strategic placement of specialized dams. When the sea level rises and the tide begins to come in, the temporary increase in tidal power is channeled into a large basin behind the dam, holding a large amount of potential energy. With the receding tide, this energy is then converted into mechanical energy as the water is released through large turbines that create electrical power through the use of generators. Barrages are essentially dams across the full width of a tidal estuary.

=== Tidal lagoon ===
A new tidal energy design option is to construct circular retaining walls embedded with turbines that can capture the potential energy of tides. The created reservoirs are similar to those of tidal barrages, except that the location is artificial and does not contain a pre-existing ecosystem.
The lagoons can also be in double (or triple) format without pumping or with pumping that will flatten out the power output. The pumping power could be provided by excess to grid demand renewable energy from for example wind turbines or solar photovoltaic arrays. Excess renewable energy rather than being curtailed could be used and stored for a later period of time. Geographically dispersed tidal lagoons with a time delay between peak production would also flatten out peak production providing near baseload production at a higher cost than other alternatives such as district heating renewable energy storage. The cancelled Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay in Wales, United Kingdom would have been the first tidal power station of this type once built.

=== Dynamic tidal power ===

Dynamic tidal power (or DTP) is a theoretical technology that would exploit an interaction between potential and kinetic energies in tidal flows. It proposes that very long dams (for example: 30–50 km length) be built from coasts straight out into the sea or ocean, without enclosing an area. Tidal phase differences are introduced across the dam, leading to a significant water-level differential in shallow coastal seas – featuring strong coast-parallel oscillating tidal currents such as found in the UK, China, and Korea.

== US and Canadian studies in the 20th century ==
The first study of large scale tidal power plants was by the US Federal Power Commission in 1924. If built, power plants would have been located in the northern border area of the US state of Maine and the southeastern border area of the Canadian province of New Brunswick, with various dams, powerhouses, and ship locks enclosing the Bay of Fundy and Passamaquoddy Bay (note: see map in reference). Nothing came of the study, and it is unknown whether Canada had been approached about the study by the US Federal Power Commission.

In 1956, utility Nova Scotia Light and Power of Halifax commissioned a pair of studies into commercial tidal power development feasibility on the Nova Scotia side of the Bay of Fundy. The two studies, by Stone &amp; Webster of Boston and by Montreal Engineering Company of Montreal, independently concluded that millions of horsepower (i.e. gigawatts) could be harnessed from Fundy but that development costs would be commercially prohibitive.

There was also a report on the international commission in April 1961 entitled &quot;Investigation of the International Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project&quot; produced by both the US and Canadian Federal Governments. According to benefit to costs ratios, the project was beneficial to the US but not to Canada. 

A study was commissioned by the Canadian &amp; Nova Scotian and New Brunswick governments (Reassessment of Fundy Tidal Power) to determine the potential for tidal barrages at Chignecto Bay and Minas Basin – at the end of the Fundy Bay estuary. There were three sites determined to be financially feasible: Shepody Bay (1550 MW), Cumberland Basin (1085 MW), and Cobequid Bay (3800 MW). These were never built despite their apparent feasibility in 1977.

== US studies in the 21st century ==
The Snohomish PUD, a public utility district located primarily in Snohomish County, Washington State, began a tidal energy project in 2007. In April 2009 the PUD selected OpenHydro, a company based in Ireland, to develop turbines and equipment for eventual installation. The project as initially designed was to place generation equipment in areas of high tidal flow and operate that equipment for four to five years. After the trial period the equipment would be removed. The project was initially budgeted at a total cost of $10 million, with half of that funding provided by the PUD out of utility reserve funds, and half from grants, primarily from the US federal government. The PUD paid for part of this project from reserves and received a $900,000 grant in 2009 and a $3.5 million grant in 2010 in addition to using reserves to pay an estimated $4 million of costs. In 2010 the budget estimate was increased to $20 million, half to be paid by the utility, half by the federal government. The utility was unable to control costs on this project, and by October 2014, the costs had ballooned to an estimated $38 million and were projected to continue to increase. The PUD proposed that the federal government provide an additional $10 million towards this increased cost, citing a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement. When the federal government refused to pay this, the PUD cancelled the project after spending nearly $10 million from reserves and grants. The PUD abandoned all tidal energy exploration after this project was cancelled and does not own or operate any tidal energy sources.

== Rance tidal power plant in France ==
In 1966, Électricité de France opened the Rance Tidal Power Station, located on the estuary of the Rance River in Brittany. It was the world&#x27;s first tidal power station. The plant was for 45 years the largest tidal power station in the world by installed capacity: Its 24 turbines reach peak output at 240 megawatts (MW) and average 57 MW, a capacity factor of approximately 24%.

== Tidal power development in the UK ==
The world&#x27;s first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to start the development of the wave and tidal energy industry in the UK. Based in Orkney, Scotland, the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world. EMEC provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions. Its grid connected tidal test site is located at the Fall of Warness, off the island of Eday, in a narrow channel which concentrates the tide as it flows between the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea. This area has a very strong tidal current, which can travel up to in spring tides. Tidal energy developers that have tested at the site include: Alstom (formerly Tidal Generation Ltd); ANDRITZ HYDRO Hammerfest; Atlantis Resources Corporation; Nautricity; OpenHydro; Scotrenewables Tidal Power; Voith. The resource could be 4 TJ per year. Elsewhere in the UK, annual energy of 50 TWh can be extracted if 25 GW capacity is installed with pivotable blades.

== Current and future tidal power schemes ==
* The Rance tidal power plant built over a period of six years from 1960 to 1966 at La Rance, France. It has 240 MW installed capacity.
* 254 MW Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Plant in South Korea is the largest tidal power installation in the world. Construction was completed in 2011.
* The Jiangxia Tidal Power Station, south of Hangzhou in China has been operational since 1985, with current installed capacity of 3.2 MW. More tidal power is planned near the mouth of the Yalu River.
* The first in-stream tidal current generator in North America (Race Rocks Tidal Power Demonstration Project) was installed at Race Rocks on southern Vancouver Island in September 2006. The Race Rocks project was shut down after operating for five years (2006–2011) because high operating costs produced electricity at a rate that was not economically feasible. The next phase in the development of this tidal current generator will be in Nova Scotia (Bay of Fundy).
* A small project was built by the Soviet Union at Kislaya Guba on the Barents Sea. It has 0.4 MW installed capacity. In 2006 it was upgraded with a 1.2 MW experimental advanced orthogonal turbine.
* Jindo Uldolmok Tidal Power Plant in South Korea is a tidal stream generation scheme planned to be expanded progressively to 90 MW of capacity by 2013. The first 1 MW was installed in May 2009.
* A 1.2 MW SeaGen system became operational in late 2008 on Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland. It was decommissioned and removed in 2016.
* The contract for an 812 MW tidal barrage near Ganghwa Island (South Korea) north-west of Incheon has been signed by Daewoo. Completion was planned for 2015 but project was retracted in 2013.
* A 1,320 MW barrage was proposed by the South Korean government in 2009, to be built around islands west of Incheon. The project halted since 2012 due to environmental concerns.
* The Scottish Government has approved plans for a 10 MW &quot;Òran na Mara&quot; array of tidal stream generators near Islay, Scotland, costing 40 million pounds, and consisting of 10 turbines – enough to power over 5,000 homes. The first turbine was expected to be in operation by 2013 and then once again announced in 2021, but as of 2023 none existed.
* The Indian state of Gujarat was planning to host South Asia&#x27;s first commercial-scale tidal power station. The company Atlantis Resources planned to install a 50 MW tidal farm in the Gulf of Kutch on India&#x27;s west coast, with construction planned to start 2012, later withdrawn due to high costs.
* Ocean Renewable Power Corporation was the first company to deliver tidal power to the US grid in September 2012 when its pilot TidGen system was successfully deployed in Cobscook Bay, near Eastport.
* In New York City, Verdant Power successfully deployed and operated three tidal turbines in the East River near Roosevelt Island, on a single triangular base system, called a TriFrame. The Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy (RITE) Project generated over 300MWh of electricity to the local grid, an American marine energy record. The system&#x27;s performance was independently confirmed by Scotland&#x27;s European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) under the new International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) international standards. This is the first instance of a third-party verification of a tidal energy converter to an international standard.
* The largest tidal energy project entitled MeyGen (398 MW) is currently in construction in the Pentland Firth in northern Scotland with 6 MW operational since 2018.
* Construction of a 320 MW tidal lagoon power plant outside the city of Swansea in the UK was granted planning permission in June 2015, however it was later rejected by the UK government in 2018. If built it would have been the world&#x27;s first tidal power plant based on a constructed lagoon.
* Mersey Tidal Power, a proposed tidal range barrage within the channel of the Mersey Estuary with a capacity of up to 1 GW is undergoing local consultation by the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.
* Up to 240 MW of tidal stream generation is proposed at Morlais, Anglesey from multiple developers, with the first turbines expected to be installed in 2026. , a total of 38 MW of capacity has been awarded Contracts for Difference to supply power to the GB grid.

== Issues and challenges ==

=== Environmental concerns ===
Tidal power can affect marine life. The turbines&#x27; rotating blades can accidentally kill swimming sea life. Projects such as the one in Strangford include a safety mechanism that turns off the turbine when marine animals approach. However, this feature causes a major loss in energy because of the amount of marine life that passes through the turbines. Some fish may avoid the area if threatened by a constantly rotating or noisy object. Marine life is a huge factor when siting tidal power energy generators, and precautions are taken to ensure that as few marine animals as possible are affected by it. In terms of global warming potential (i.e. carbon footprint), the impact of tidal power generation technologies ranges between 15 and 37 gCO2-eq/kWhe, with a median value of 23.8 gCO2-eq/kWhe. This is in line with the impact of other renewables like wind and solar power, and significantly better than fossil-based technologies. The Tethys database provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of tidal energy.

==== Tidal turbines ====
The main environmental concern with tidal energy is associated with blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high-speed water increases the risk of organisms being pushed near or through these devices. As with all offshore renewable energies, there is also a concern about how the creation of electromagnetic fields and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms. Because these devices are in the water, the acoustic output can be greater than those created with offshore wind energy. Depending on the frequency and amplitude of sound generated by the tidal energy devices, this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals (particularly those who echolocate to communicate and navigate in the marine environment, such as dolphins and whales). Tidal energy removal can also cause environmental concerns such as degrading far-field water quality and disrupting sediment processes. Depending on the size of the project, these effects can range from small traces of sediment building up near the tidal device to severely affecting nearshore ecosystems and processes.

==== Tidal barrage ====
Installing a barrage may change the shoreline within the bay or estuary, affecting a large ecosystem that depends on tidal flats. Inhibiting the flow of water in and out of the bay, there may also be less flushing of the bay or estuary, causing additional turbidity (suspended solids) and less saltwater, which may result in the death of fish that act as a vital food source to birds and mammals. Migrating fish may also be unable to access breeding streams, and may attempt to pass through the turbines. The same acoustic concerns apply to tidal barrages. Decreasing shipping accessibility can become a socio-economic issue, though locks can be added to allow slow passage. However, the barrage may improve the local economy by increasing land access as a bridge. Calmer waters may also allow better recreation in the bay or estuary. In August 2004, a humpback whale swam through the open sluice gate of the Annapolis Royal Generating Station at slack tide, ending up trapped for several days before eventually finding its way out to the Annapolis Basin.

==== Tidal lagoon ====
Environmentally, the main concerns are blade strike on fish attempting to enter the lagoon, the acoustic output from turbines, and changes in sedimentation processes. However, all these effects are localized and do not affect the entire estuary or bay.

=== Corrosion ===
Saltwater causes corrosion in metal parts. It can be difficult to maintain tidal stream generators due to their size and depth in the water. The use of corrosion-resistant materials such as stainless steels, high-nickel alloys, copper-nickel alloys, nickel-copper alloys and titanium can greatly reduce, or eliminate corrosion damage. Composite materials could also be used, as composites do not corrode and could provide lightweight, durable structures for tidal power. Composite materials are being evaluated for tidal power.

Mechanical fluids, such as lubricants, can leak out, which may be harmful to the marine life nearby. Proper maintenance can minimize the number of harmful chemicals that may enter the environment.

=== Fouling ===
The biological events that happen when placing any structure in an area of high tidal currents and high biological productivity in the ocean will ensure that the structure becomes an ideal substrate for the growth of marine organisms.

=== Cost ===
Tidal energy has a high initial cost, which may be one of the reasons why it is not a popular source of renewable energy, although research has shown that the public is willing to pay for and support research and development of tidal energy devices. The methods of generating electricity from tidal energy are relatively new technology. Tidal energy is however still very early in the research process and it may be possible to reduce costs in future. The cost-effectiveness varies according to the site of the tidal generators. One indication of cost-effectiveness is the Gibrat ratio, which is the length of the barrage in metres divided by the annual energy production in kilowatt hours.

As tidal energy is reliable, it can reasonably be predicted how long it will take to pay off the high up-front cost of these generators. Due to the success of a greatly simplified design, the orthogonal turbine offers considerable cost savings. As a result, the production period of each generating unit is reduced, lower metal consumption is needed and technical efficiency is greater.

A possible risk is rising sea levels due to climate change, which may alter the characteristics of the local tides reducing future power generation.

== Structural health monitoring ==
The high load factors resulting from the fact that water is around 800 times denser than air, and the predictable and reliable nature of tides compared with the wind, make tidal energy particularly attractive for electric power generation. Condition monitoring is the key for exploiting it cost-efficiently.

<doc id="325064" wikidata="Q1336234" url="?curid=325064" title="Scenic painting (theatre)">
<text>Theatrical scenic painting includes wide-ranging disciplines, encompassing virtually the entire scope of painting and craft techniques. An experienced scenic painter (or scenic artist) will have skills in landscape painting, figurative painting, &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;, and faux finishing, and be versatile in different media such as acrylic, oil, and tempera paint. The painter might also be accomplished in three-dimensional skills such as sculpting, plasterering and gilding. To select the optimal materials, scenic painters must also have knowledge of paint composition. 

The scenic painter takes direction from the theatre designer. In some cases designers paint their own designs.

The techniques and specialized knowledge of the scenic painter replicate an image to a larger scale from a designer&#x27;s maquette, perhaps with accompanying photographs, printouts and original research, and sometimes with paint and style samples. Often, custom tools are made to create the desired effect. 

== History ==
The first written description of scenic painting as an art form is from the Italian Renaissance, when Leon Battista Alberti examined Greek stage painting and decoration in the time of Aeschylus. During and after the Renaissance, the ability to draw in perspective became core to painting for the stage.

In the late 19th century, it was not unusual for successful scenic artists to achieve celebrity status, as spectacular backdrops became fashionable. With the emergence of modern stage design in the early 20th century, painted scenery came to considered &quot;quaint&quot;. 

Since then, he practice of modern stage painting has evolved and continues to flourish today. Although the best scenic painters are rarely credited in theatre programs on the same level as scenic designers, they are highly respected in the theatre profession and critical to the creative process.

== Scenic paint ==
Scenic paint has traditionally been mixed by the painter using pigment powder colour, a binder and a medium. The binder adheres the powder to itself and to the surface on which it is applied. The medium is a thinner which allows the paint to be worked more easily, disappearing as the paint dries. Today it is common to use brands of ready-made scenic paint, or pigment suspended in a medium to which a binder will be added.

<text>Reeve Aleutian Airways was an airline headquartered in Anchorage, Alaska, United States. It ceased operations on December 5, 2000. Reeve Aleutian was named, possibly as a pun on the word revolution, by combining founder Robert C. Reeve&#x27;s surname and the Aleutian Islands, its primary destination.

==History==
===Founding===
In February 1946, Bob Reeve received a call informing him that some ex-USAAF C-47s and Douglas DC-3s were for sale (the C-47 being the military version of the DC-3). Reeve bought his first DC-3 for $20,000 with $3,000 down and the balance payable over 3 years. The cost of conversion to civilian standard was quoted at $50,000, but Reeve did the work himself at a cost of $5,000.

A strike by sailors on steamships operating between Seattle and Anchorage started on April 6, 1946. Reeve, along with Merritt Boyle and Bill Borland began flying between Seattle and Anchorage, with stops at Juneau, Yakutat or Annette Island. Each trip carried a full load of 21 passengers and took an average of hours. In 53 days, 26 round trips were made. Reeve would work all night on inspections and maintenance of the plane at Spokane, and then fly back to Anchorage having had very little sleep. Reeve earned $93,000 from this activity, enough to pay for the DC-3 and buy three more.
In July 1946, another DC-3 was purchased from the USAF. In the winter of 1946–47, Reeve filed with the CAA for a license to operate on the run between Anchorage and Attu, and in the summer of 1947 he was making weekly flights down the chain. Within a year, he was running a twice-weekly service, keeping all four DC-3s busy. It was during this time that Reeve Aleutian suffered its first accident. DC-3 N46567 being damaged in an accident during take-off at Merrill Field. The aircraft was insured, and Reeve bought a twin-engine Beechcraft and a Lockheed Electra 10-B to replace the DC-3, which was subsequently repaired and eventually sold.

On March 24, 1947, Reeve Aleutian Airways was incorporated. The company was running scheduled and charter services all over Alaska, despite not having a formal CAA certificate. About this time, Reeve was ordered to get authorization to use the wartime Chain bases he was using. Reeve flew to Washington and leased Dutch Harbor field and acquired landing permits for Kodiak, Adak and Attu. Electra NC14994 was traded in during 1947, going to Continental Airlines.

In April 1948, Reeve Aleutian Airways was granted a temporary, five-year airline certificate. With the need to run the business on proper business lines (maintain an office, publish schedules and tariffs etc.), the Beechcraft and Electra were traded in for two Sikorsky S-43 amphibians. In October 1948, Port Heiden was de-activated, followed by Dutch Harbor, Attu and Umnak. Reeve took over Umnak and conceded Attu, which was not vital to his operations. About this time, the Naval Air Transport Service began selling tickets to Adak in competition with Reeve. Reeve went to Washington and met with Louis Johnson, who granted all the business in the area to Reeve. In 1948 another DC-3, a Sikorsky S-43 and a Grumman G-21 Goose were purchased.

In March 1949, four days&#x27; notice was given that Shemya was to close. This base was vital to Reeve, as it was an all-weather alternative to Adak, Amchitka and Attu. Northwest also needed the base on its run to the Orient. Reeve and Croil Hunter (President of Northwest) flew to Washington to plead their case without success, but on their way back to the hotel, Reeve met Major General Sam Anderson, who had served with Reeve&#x27;s brother Richard, and explained their predicament with the result that the military were persuaded to pronounce the field &quot;militarily desirable&quot; and thus Shemya was saved.

A Sikorsky S-43 registered N15062 was purchased in March 1950. In late 1950, the bank was reluctant to loan Reeve any more capital. Reeve flew to Seattle in an effort to get a loan, but was turned down. He ran into Elmer Rasmusson, an Anchorage banker, whilst in Seattle, with the result that Rasmusson loaned him $125,000 to get going again. On the day he got the loan, Reeve heard that Pacific Airmotive, who were doing his maintenance, were going out of business in Alaska. Reeve flew back to Anchorage and bought the business, which was renamed Reeve Airmotive.

In 1952, the new Anchorage International Airport opened and all the other airlines moved there. The CAA was going to close Merrill Field, but it was retained for use by Reeve Aleutian and private operators. In 1953, final military deactivation of the Aleutian airfields occurred. Reeve obtained leases on Shemya and Cold Bay. Shemya closed in 1954 and all flights were switched to Cold Bay. In January 1957, A Douglas DC-3 registered N49363 was sold to Twentieth Century Aircraft. During the 1950s, St. George and Chernofski were served by airdrop, Reeve installing salvaged bomb releases in his DC-3s to enable this.

===Expansion===
By the mid-1950s, it was apparent that the DC-3s were not big enough for Reeve Aleutian. Therefore, the Douglas DC-4 was selected to supplement the DC-3s, eventually replacing them. Reeve&#x27;s first DC-4 was purchased in March 1957 from Twentieth Century Airlines, which was going out of business. The first scheduled DC-4 flight was on March 12, 1957. The route was Anchorage-Kodiak-Cold Bay-Adak-Amchitka-Shemya-Attu. Umnak was served as required.

In 1957, the Distant Early Warning line was being constructed, bringing a boom to Reeve Aleutian. In 1957, an S-43 was traded in, two Curtiss C-46 Commandos were purchased from Cordova Airlines and Grumman G-21 Goose was leased from Interior Airways. Merrill Field proved too small for the DC-4, so Reeve Aleutian moved to Anchorage International in 1958. By the early 1960s, the DC-4 was proving outdated, and therefore a Douglas DC-6B was purchased in January 1962.

===1970s===

The late 1960s saw the emergence of the Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop airliner, which was to be backbone of Reeve Aleutian&#x27;s business until Boeing 727-100 jets joined the fleet in later years. The first was purchased from California Airmotive in February 1968. With the acquisition of the Electras, the DC-6s were phased out of passenger service.

Reeve Aleutian still had DC-3s in service, and a replacement was sought. The NAMC YS-11A was decided on and the first aircraft was purchased new in 1972. In 1973, the Electra was certified by the CAA to land on gravel runways.

On November 11, 1974, there was a hangar fire at Anchorage, and two Electra aircraft were destroyed. In April 1977 the two Gooses were sold to Peninsula Airways, and their service subcontracted for services out of Cold Bay.

In 1979, Reeve Aleutian initiated nonstop service between Cold Bay, Alaska and Seattle–Tacoma flying the Lockheed L-188 Electra. This service lasted for three and a half years. During that time, only nine out of 458 scheduled flights were cancelled, seven due to weather and two flights due to mechanical issues.

===The jet age===
In December 1983, Reeve Aleutian purchased two Boeing 727-22QC combi aircraft from Wien Air Alaska. During the Christmas 1985 holiday, there was a large backlog of mail at Seattle–Tacoma, and Reeve Aleutian contracted with the USPS to relieve the backlog.

The airline entered the 1990s on a relatively tight budget, with three aircraft mothballed and one leased out. In August 1999, Reeve Aleutian entered into a codeshare agreement with Alaska Airlines on the route between Seattle, Anchorage and Russian cities Petropavlovsk and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.

===End of operations===
Reeve Aleutian ceased operations on December 5, 2000, and about 250 people were laid off. Reasons given for the situation included increased competition and high fuel prices. At the end, only one Lockheed Electra propjet and one Boeing 727 jetliner were in service.

<doc id="325067" wikidata="Q216113" url="?curid=325067" title="Agathis">
<text>Agathis, commonly known as kauri or dammara, is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees, native to Australasia and Southeast Asia. It is one of three extant genera in the family Araucariaceae, alongside &quot;Wollemia&quot; and &quot;Araucaria&quot; (being more closely related to the former). Its leaves are much broader than most conifers. Kauri gum is commercially harvested from New Zealand kauri.
== Description ==
Mature kauri trees have characteristically large trunks, with little or no branching below the crown. In contrast, young trees are normally conical in shape, forming a more rounded or irregularly shaped crown as they achieve maturity.

The bark is smooth and light grey to grey-brown, usually peeling into irregular flakes that become thicker on more mature trees. The branch structure is often horizontal or, when larger, ascending. The lowest branches often leave annular branch scars when they detach from the lower trunk.

The juvenile leaves in all species are larger than the adult, more or less acute, varying among the species from ovate to lanceolate. Adult leaves are opposite, elliptical to linear, very leathery and quite thick. Young leaves are often a coppery-red, contrasting markedly with the usually green or glaucous-green foliage of the previous season.

The male pollen cones appear usually only on larger trees after seed cones have appeared. The female seed cones usually develop on short lateral branchlets, maturing after two years. They are normally oval or globe shaped.

Seeds of some species are attacked by the caterpillars of &quot;Agathiphaga&quot;, some of the most primitive of all living moths.

== Uses ==

Various species of kauri give diverse resins such as kauri gum. The timber is generally straight-grained and of fine quality with an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and rot resistance, making it ideal for yacht hull construction. The wood is commonly used in the manufacture of guitars and ukuleles due to its low density and relatively low price of production. It is also used for some Go boards (goban). The uses of the New Zealand species (&quot;A. australis&quot;) included shipbuilding, house construction, wood panelling, furniture making, mine braces, and railway sleepers. Due to the hard resin of the wood, it was the traditionally preferred material used by Māori for wooden weapons, patu aruhe (fernroot beaters) and barkcloth beaters.

== Evolutionary history ==
Within Araucariaceae, &quot;Agathis&quot; is more closely related to &quot;Wollemia&quot; than to &quot;Araucaria.&quot; The oldest fossils currently confidently assignable to &quot;Agathis&quot; are those of &quot;Agathis immortalis&quot; from the Salamanca Formation of Patagonia, which dates to the Paleocene, approximately 64.67–63.49 million years ago. &quot;Agathis&quot;-like leaves are also known from the slightly older Lefipán Formation of the same region, which date to the very end of the Cretaceous. Some authors have suggested that &quot;Agathis&quot; is known from earlier in the Cretaceous (Aptian to Cenomanian in North Africa. Other fossils of the genus are known from the Eocene of Patagonia, the Late Paleocene-Miocene of southern Australia, and the Oligocene-Miocene of New Zealand.

<doc id="325070" wikidata="Q113215" url="?curid=325070" title="Carlsberg Group">
<text>Carlsberg A/S (; ) is a Danish multinational brewer. Founded in 1847 by J. C. Jacobsen, the company&#x27;s headquarters is in Copenhagen, Denmark. Since Jacobsen&#x27;s death in 1887, the majority owner of the company has been the Carlsberg Foundation. The company&#x27;s flagship brand is Carlsberg (named after Jacobsen&#x27;s son Carl). The company employs around 41,000 people, primarily in Europe and Asia. 
Carlsberg is currently the sixth largest brewery in the world based on revenue.

==History==


Carlsberg was founded by J. C. Jacobsen, a philanthropist and admirer of science. The first brew was finished on 10 November 1847, and the export of Carlsberg beer began in 1868 with the export of one barrel to Edinburgh, Scotland. Some of the company&#x27;s original logos include an elephant, after which some of its lagers are named, and the swastika, the use of which was discontinued in the 1930s because of its association with political parties in neighboring Germany.

Jacobsen&#x27;s son, Carl Christian Hilmar Jacobsen, opened a brewery in 1882 named Ny (New) Carlsberg; this forced J.C. Jacobsen to rename his brewery Gamle (Old) Carlsberg. Carl Jacobsen was an avid art collector. With his fortune he amassed an art collection first housed privately, but since 1897 housed public in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in central Copenhagen.
The companies were merged and run under Carl&#x27;s direction in 1906 and remained so until his death in 1914.

Jacobsen set up the Carlsberg Laboratory in 1875, which worked on scientific problems related to brewing. It featured a Department of Chemistry and a Department of Physiology. The species of yeast used to make pale lager, &quot;Saccharomyces carlsbergensis&quot;, was isolated by Emil Christian Hansen at the laboratory in 1883 and bears its name; this was shared freely by Carlsberg. The Carlsberg Laboratory also developed the concept of pH and made advances in protein chemistry. In 1972, the Carlsberg Research Centre was established and the Carlsberg Laboratory is an independent unit of the Centre.

In 1876, J.C. Jacobsen established the Carlsberg Foundation, run by trustees from the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, which managed the Carlsberg Laboratory as well as supporting scientific research within the fields of natural sciences, mathematics, philosophy, the humanities and social sciences in Denmark. Because of a conflict with his son Carl, Jacobsen&#x27;s brewery was left to the Foundation upon his death in 1887.


The first overseas license for brewing was given to the Photos Photiades Breweries, and in 1966 Carlsberg beer was brewed for the first time outside Denmark at the Photiades breweries in Cyprus. The first brewery to be built outside Denmark was in Blantyre, Malawi in 1968.

Carlsberg merged with Tuborg Breweries in 1970 (but backdated to 1969) forming the &quot;De forenede Bryggerier&quot; (United Breweries AS), and merged with Tetley in 1992. Carlsberg became the sole owner of Carlsberg-Tetley in 1997.

In 2008, Carlsberg Group, together with Heineken, bought Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the largest brewer in the UK, for £7.8bn ($15.3bn).

In 2013, the company joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers&#x27; commitments to reducing harmful drinking.

In November 2014, Carlsberg agreed to take over Greece&#x27;s third largest brewery, the Olympic Brewery, adding to its operations in the country and effectively transforming the firm into the second biggest market player in Greece.

The old brewery in Copenhagen was once open for tours. In January 2020, the brewery was closed for a complete refurbishment. It reopened in a fully refurbished museum called Home of Carlsberg in December 2023. 

In 2024, a High Court Judge approved a £3.3bn deal for Carlsberg to buy UK drinks maker Britvic. Carlsberg plans to create a single integrated drinks business called Carlsberg Britvic following the takeover. Britvic, external, based in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, employs about 4,500 people and produces J20, Robinsons squash and Tango.

==Regional operations==
The Carlsberg Group divides their operations into three market areas: Northern and Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Asia.

===Europe===

Carlsberg Polska is the Polish subsidiary of the Carlsberg Group. Carlsberg acquired 100% control of the Okocim Group, which included the Okocim Brewery, in 2004.

===Russia and CIS===
The company is a significant operator in the brewing industry in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, owning its subsidiaries through Baltic Beverages Holding which initially was a joint venture between Carlsberg and Scottish &amp; Newcastle in Russia. It had a majority interest in OAO Baltika Breweries, the largest brewery in the Russian Federation and Eastern Europe. In the spring of 2023, Carlsberg announced that it was leaving Russia and plans to sell its business before the end of spring. In late June, the company announced that it had closed the deal without naming a buyer. The deal is awaiting approval from the Russian authorities. In July 2023, the Russian government seized the shares of the Carlsberg-owned Baltika Breweries and placed the company under the control of the Russian Federal Agency for State Property Management.

The Uzbek government claimed the subsidiary owed $4.6 million in taxes from unreported revenue. Lower courts also claimed that Carlsberg illegally produced 1.6 million litres of beer from 2008 to 2010. For these reasons, in March 2012, Carlsberg suspended production at its Uzbek plant and asked its employees to take an unpaid leave. In late 2012, the Uzbek Court declined Carlsberg&#x27;s tax appeal. Production resumed in April 2013. The brewery produces 1.3 million litres of beer under three local brands Sarbast Original, Sarbast Extra, and Sarbast Special, plus the international brand Tuborg Green.

==Beers==
===Carlsberg===


Carlsberg is the flagship beer brand in Carlsberg Group&#x27;s portfolio of 155 brands. It is a 5% abv pilsner beer (In the UK, it previously had 3.8% abv but reduced to 3.4% abv, cited as being due to an increase in duty tax and is now branded as Carlsberg Danish Pilsner.) with a global distribution to 140 markets. 
It is also known as Carlsberg Lager, Carlsberg Beer and Carlsberg Pilsner. It was first brewed in 1904, and was created by Carl Jacobsen, son of Carlsberg&#x27;s founder J. C. Jacobsen.

The introduction of the Carlsberg pilsner also saw the reintroduction of the Art Nouveau-style logo that has been used nearly unmodified since 1904, and later became the logo of the entire company. It was designed by Thorvald Bindesbøll.

In Denmark, the beer is often known as &quot;Hof&quot; (court) due to its Royal Warrant. This nickname was adopted into the brand in 1931 but discontinued in Denmark in 1991. The term is still used in other markets such as the UK and Sweden.

===Special Brew===



Special Brew is a strong lager brewed only in Denmark, Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom. It was initially brewed by Carlsberg to commemorate a visit to Denmark by Winston Churchill in 1950. The flavour incorporates &quot;cognac flavours among its tasting notes&quot; as Churchill was partial to brandy. In May 1951 two crates were delivered to Churchill&#x27;s London home. In a thank-you letter Churchill called the drink &quot;Commemoration Lager&quot;. In Denmark the drink was called  (&quot;Easter Brew&quot;), but the Easter Brew has since been replaced by a weaker beer (). For the British market Carlsberg called the drink Special Brew, and production was started in Northampton in the mid-1970s.

At 7.5% alcohol (previously 9%, then 8% for a short time), Special Brew is part of a group of strong lagers that are termed &quot;super-strength&quot; in the UK and malt liquor in the USA. This beer is often associated with street alcoholics.

A single can (440mL) of Special Brew contains 3.5 units of alcohol (previously 4.5 units) whilst the maximum recommended daily intake for a man is two units. In January 2015, it was reported that Carlsberg would reduce the units per can to less than four, in line with a UK government pledge that no single can should contain more than four units. The change, a reduction either in the size of the can from 500mL to 440mL, or the alcoholic strength of the beer, was considered for implementation in 2015. Both changes were made; the cans have since been reduced to 440 mL, and the ABV reduced from 9% to 8%, then another drop to 7.5%.


===Elephant beer===

In 1901, at brewer Carl Jacobsen&#x27;s initiative, the Architect Professor J. L. Dahlerup created a tower resting on four elephants carved in granite from the Danish island of Bornholm. Jacobsen&#x27;s inspiration was the obelisk supporting an elephant on the Piazza della Minerva in Rome. The four elephants each bear the initial of one of Carl Jacobsen&#x27;s children: Theodora, Paula, Helge and Vagn. This became known as The Elephant Gate and is a landmark entrance to the brewery.

To the west of the gate, Carl Jacobsen&#x27;s motto was inscribed: &quot;Laboremus pro Patria&quot; (Let us work for our country). Since then, the Elephant has been a famous part of the Carlsberg family, especially after the strong Elephant Beer was created in 1955 under the name Export Lager Beer featuring the Elephant label. The Elephant is still brewed in Carlsberg Breweries in Copenhagen and exported around the world. A few markets brew their own Carlsberg Elephant beer locally according to the original recipe.

==Advertising==


Carlsberg&#x27;s tagline &quot;Probably the best lager in the world&quot; was created in 1973 by Tony Bodinetz at KMP for the UK market. It began to appear in company corporate ads around the world from the 1980s onwards until it was replaced in 2011 in most regions by new tagline &quot;That calls for a Carlsberg&quot;.
The voice over for the original ad in 1983 was voiced by actor Orson Welles, his voice has been used repeatedly over the years. Welles was not expensive and he liked the advertisements, so he kept his fees to a minimum. In some countries the tagline has been adapted to &quot;Probably the best beer in the world&quot;.

Carlsberg was featured in the film &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot; (not, however, in the book on which the film was based) as the lager the main cast get to drink after driving across the desert. Lines from the film gave rise to one of Carlsberg&#x27;s best known advertising slogans in the UK: &quot;worth waiting for&quot;.

Carlsberg has been criticised for breaking their own code of conduct for alcohol advertisement in Malawi.

In 2011, &quot;That calls for a Carlsberg&quot; was introduced as the new Carlsberg tagline and has appeared in various television adverts since. The new-look marketing campaign was rolled out across 140 markets and included a new 30-second TV ad called &#x27;Spaceman&#x27;. The company wants to boost sales in Asia and the Far East, but there were fears that &#x27;probably&#x27; was too subtle as a tagline.

===Sponsorships===
Sponsorships from Carlsberg comes in two forms, sharply separated: either from the Carlsberg Brewery as part of their commercial campaigns, or as significant contributions to arts and sciences via the Carlsberg Foundation (who owns the brewery).

Carlsberg Brewery was one of the major sponsors of Euro 2008, Euro 2012 and also UEFA Euro 2016 (where their adboards were changed to read their abridged tagline, &quot;Probably&quot;, due to France&#x27;s laws against alcohol advertising). Carlsberg was one of the major sponsors of the 2004 European Football Championship and use the promotional slogan &quot;probably the best lager in the world&quot;; they were also a sponsor of the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Carlsberg are best known in the UK as the main and shirt sponsors of Liverpool F.C. having sponsored the club from 1992 continuing through to 2016. With Liverpool being the only UK city exhibiting at the World Expo in Shanghai – its twin city, the Carlsberg logo on the Liverpool F.C jersey was written in Chinese for the league match against Chelsea F.C on 2 May 2010.

Carlsberg also sponsor F.C. Copenhagen, Havant and Waterlooville, Odense Boldklub, Pirin Blagoevgrad and are also the secondary sponsor (after Eircom) of the Republic of Ireland national football team and Tottenham Hotspur F.C. Carlsberg also sponsors other sport events, such as golf and skiing. On 13 July 2011 Carlsberg signed a sponsorship contract with Hajduk Split and contributed 40,000 Euros to the team to help avert a financial crisis in 2013.

As of August 2011, Carlsberg also became Arsenal F.C&#x27;s official beer sponsor for three years. Carlsberg has also sponsored the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens in 2015.

Goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel became the first ever worldwide ambassador for Carlsberg. He was announced as the face of Carlsberg&#x27;s UEFA Euro 2016 sponsorship campaign.

The Institute of Theoretical Physics (also known as the &quot;Niels Bohr Institute&quot;) in Copenhagen, which was one of the leading international centers for theoretical physics during the 1920s and 1930s and is said to be the birthplace of quantum mechanics, was created in 1921 with significant funding from the Carlsberg Foundation. Other projects funded by the Carlsberg Foundation include: Dating the Greenland Ice Core, Uncovering the Iron-Age in Northern Europe, 
Discovering the Secrets of Molecular Diversity, and Creating Dictionaries on the Web.

==Controversies==

=== China ===
Danish investigative site Danwatch accuses Carlsberg of participating in government oppression of Uyghurs by operating breweries, producing Wusu Beer, and holding the Wusu Beer Festival in Xinjiang while the government sanctions Muslims for abstaining from alcohol.

===Nepal===
A factory in Nepal owned by Carlsberg has been shown to severely pollute a nearby river. Initially, Carlsberg denied the pollution; since in 2018, the company admitted to the wrongdoing.

===Russia===
In March 2022, Carlsberg issued a press release stating they would leave the Russian market following the continued invasion of Ukraine by Russia as part of the Russo-Ukrainian War. By the following March, Carlsberg had not left and was exploring the possibility of a buyback clause but in June 2023 the company announced that a deal to sell the Russia business had been reached. In July 2023 Russia seized the shares in the Carlsberg-owned Baltika Breweries and placed it under the control of the Russian Federal Agency for State Property Management.

The new CEO of the Carlsberg Group, Jacob Aarup-Andersen, said in the fall of 2023 that Russia had stolen their business and that the group would not enter into negotiations with the Russian authorities.

<text>Carl Christian Hillman Jacobsen (2 March 1842 – 11 January 1914) was a Danish brewer, art collector and philanthropist. Though often preoccupied with his cultural interests, Jacobsen was a shrewd and visionary businessman and initiated the transition of the brewery Carlsberg from a local Copenhagen brewery to the multinational conglomerate that it is today.

==Background==
Carl Jacobsen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was the son of J. C. Jacobsen (1811-1887), who founded the brewery Carlsberg. After 1861, he became a student from the Borgerdyd School in Christianshavn. From 1866, he conducted a four year study trip to the leading breweries abroad.

==Career==

Jacobsen worked for his father but partly because of his conflicts between them, he founded his own brewery in 1882. It was first named Valby Brewery but upon his father&#x27;s approval changed its name to Ny Carlsberg (English: New Carlsberg), while his father&#x27;s enterprise at the same occasion changed its name to Gammel Carlsberg (English: Old Carlsberg). At his father&#x27;s death, Carl Jacobsen did not at once obtain the leading post of the old brewery. Instead his father left it to the Carlsberg Foundation (&quot;Carlsbergfondet&quot;) which he had founded in 1876. In 1906 the two Carlsberg breweries merged and Carl Jacobsen was CEO of &quot;Carlsberg&quot;. As a &quot;sole ruler&quot; he carried on his father’s work.

==Artistic interest and philanthropy==
Carl Jacobsen did not share his father&#x27;s political commitment, though like him he was an eager cultural enthusiast known for his interest in Greek and classical art and his engagement led to the founding of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in 1897, an art museum mainly based upon his Antique collections still regarded as one of the most important Danish art museums.

Carl Jacobsen&#x27;s interest in the arts is also demonstrated by his brewery. He employed the leading Danish architects of the time, mainly Vilhelm Dahlerup, and the buildings were designed with great care to detail as seen in the Winding Chimney.

Often taking part in discussions of architecture of Copenhagen, he paid for the restoration of several churches and public buildings and was also behind the 1913 sculpture &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;.

==Personal life==

Jacobsen met his wife Ottilia Marie Jacobsen née Stegmann (3 October 1854 – 20 July 1903) during a business trip to Edinburgh, Scotland. They were married in Copenhagen on 24 September 1874. Ottilia was the daughter of the Danish grain merchant Lorents Konrad Carl Stegmann (aka Conrad Stegmann) and Margrethe Louise Marie née Brummer. She was almost as famous as Jacobsen within the contemporary arts community in Denmark. They were the parents of nine children born between 1875 and 1890.

Jacobsen became an extraordinary member of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (1897), honorary member of the Société des artistes français (1909), member (associé) of the Académie des Beaux-Arts (1913), Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog (1888), Dannebrogsmand (1891), Commander of the 2nd degree (1897) and of 1st degree 1906 and received the Grand Cross (1912). Carl Jacobsen died 11 January 1914 and was buried in the family mausoleum at Jesus Church, Copenhagen.

<text>The 7th government of Ireland (2 June 1954 – 20 March 1957), commonly known as the Second inter-party government, was the government of Ireland formed after the 1954 general election to the 15th Dáil held on 18 May. It was a minority government of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Clann na Talmhan. Clann na Poblachta, which had been in the First inter-party government (1948–1951) with these parties, supported the government but did form part of it. It lasted for .

==Nomination of Taoiseach==
The 15th Dáil first met on 2 June 1954. In the debate on the nomination of Taoiseach, Fianna Fáil leader and outgoing Taoiseach Éamon de Valera and former Taoiseach John A. Costello of Fine Gael were both proposed. The nomination of de Valera was defeated with 66 votes cast in favour and 78 against, while the nomination of Costello was approved by 79 to 66. Costello was appointed as Taoiseach by President Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly.

==Members of the Government==
The Ministers of the Government were proposed by the Taoiseach and approved by the Dáil. They were appointed by the president on the same day.
==Parliamentary Secretaries==
On 3 June 1954, the government appointed the Parliamentary Secretaries on the nomination of the Taoiseach.
==Foreign Policy==
Ireland joined the United Nations in 1955.

==Dissolution of the Dáil==
The government ended when the Clann na Poblachta withdrew its support in 1957. Fine Gael and Labour had also both lost seats in by-elections to Fianna Fáil the previous year. Costello sought a dissolution of the Dáil on 4 February 1957 which was granted by the president, leading to a general election on 9 March 1957.

<text>Domain theory is a branch of mathematics that studies special kinds of partially ordered sets (posets) commonly called domains. Consequently, domain theory can be considered as a branch of order theory. The field has major applications in computer science, where it is used to specify denotational semantics, especially for functional programming languages. Domain theory formalizes the intuitive ideas of approximation and convergence in a very general way and is closely related to topology.

== Motivation and intuition ==
The primary motivation for the study of domains, which was initiated by Dana Scott in the late 1960s, was the search for a denotational semantics of the lambda calculus. In this formalism, one considers &quot;functions&quot; specified by certain terms in the language. In a purely syntactic way, one can go from simple functions to functions that take other functions as their input arguments. Using again just the syntactic transformations available in this formalism, one can obtain so-called fixed-point combinators (the best-known of which is the Y combinator); these, by definition, have the property that &quot;f&quot;(Y(&quot;f&quot;)) = Y(&quot;f&quot;) for all functions &quot;f&quot;.

To formulate such a denotational semantics, one might first try to construct a &quot;model&quot; for the lambda calculus, in which a genuine (total) function is associated with each lambda term. Such a model would formalize a link between the lambda calculus as a purely syntactic system and the lambda calculus as a notational system for manipulating concrete mathematical functions. The combinator calculus is such a model. However, the elements of the combinator calculus are functions from functions to functions; in order for the elements of a model of the lambda calculus to be of arbitrary domain and range, they could not be true functions, only partial functions.

Scott got around this difficulty by formalizing a notion of &quot;partial&quot; or &quot;incomplete&quot; information to represent computations that have not yet returned a result. This was modeled by considering, for each domain of computation (e.g. the natural numbers), an additional element that represents an &quot;undefined&quot; output, i.e. the &quot;result&quot; of a computation that never ends. In addition, the domain of computation is equipped with an &quot;ordering relation&quot;, in which the &quot;undefined result&quot; is the least element.

The important step to finding a model for the lambda calculus is to consider only those functions (on such a partially ordered set) that are guaranteed to have least fixed points. The set of these functions, together with an appropriate ordering, is again a &quot;domain&quot; in the sense of the theory. But the restriction to a subset of all available functions has another great benefit: it is possible to obtain domains that contain their own function spaces, i.e. one gets functions that can be applied to themselves.

Beside these desirable properties, domain theory also allows for an appealing intuitive interpretation. As mentioned above, the domains of computation are always partially ordered. This ordering represents a hierarchy of information or knowledge. The higher an element is within the order, the more specific it is and the more information it contains. Lower elements represent incomplete knowledge or intermediate results.

Computation then is modeled by applying monotone functions repeatedly on elements of the domain in order to refine a result. Reaching a fixed point is equivalent to finishing a calculation. Domains provide a superior setting for these ideas since fixed points of monotone functions can be guaranteed to exist and, under additional restrictions, can be approximated from below.

== A guide to the formal definitions ==
In this section, the central concepts and definitions of domain theory will be introduced. The above intuition of domains being &quot;information orderings&quot; will be emphasized to motivate the mathematical formalization of the theory. The precise formal definitions are to be found in the dedicated articles for each concept. A list of general order-theoretic definitions, which include domain theoretic notions as well can be found in the order theory glossary. The most important concepts of domain theory will nonetheless be introduced below.

=== Directed sets as converging specifications ===
As mentioned before, domain theory deals with partially ordered sets to model a domain of computation. The goal is to interpret the elements of such an order as &quot;pieces of information&quot; or &quot;(partial) results of a computation&quot;, where elements that are higher in the order extend the information of the elements below them in a consistent way. From this simple intuition it is already clear that domains often do not have a greatest element, since this would mean that there is an element that contains the information of &quot;all&quot; other elements—a rather uninteresting situation.

A concept that plays an important role in the theory is that of a directed subset of a domain; a directed subset is a non-empty subset of the order in which any two elements have an upper bound that is an element of this subset. In view of our intuition about domains, this means that any two pieces of information within the directed subset are &quot;consistently&quot; extended by some other element in the subset. Hence we can view directed subsets as &quot;consistent specifications&quot;, i.e. as sets of partial results in which no two elements are contradictory. This interpretation can be compared with the notion of a convergent sequence in analysis, where each element is more specific than the preceding one. Indeed, in the theory of metric spaces, sequences play a role that is in many aspects analogous to the role of directed sets in domain theory.

Now, as in the case of sequences, we are interested in the &quot;limit&quot; of a directed set. According to what was said above, this would be an element that is the most general piece of information that extends the information of all elements of the directed set, i.e. the unique element that contains &quot;exactly&quot; the information that was present in the directed set, and nothing more. In the formalization of order theory, this is just the least upper bound of the directed set. As in the case of the limit of a sequence, the least upper bound of a directed set does not always exist.

Naturally, one has a special interest in those domains of computations in which all consistent specifications &quot;converge&quot;, i.e. in orders in which all directed sets have a least upper bound. This property defines the class of directed-complete partial orders, or dcpo for short. Indeed, most considerations of domain theory do only consider orders that are at least directed complete.

From the underlying idea of partially specified results as representing incomplete knowledge, one derives another desirable property: the existence of a least element. Such an element models that state of no information—the place where most computations start. It also can be regarded as the output of a computation that does not return any result at all.

=== Computations and domains ===
Now that we have some basic formal descriptions of what a domain of computation should be, we can turn to the computations themselves. Clearly, these have to be functions, taking inputs from some computational domain and returning outputs in some (possibly different) domain. However, one would also expect that the output of a function will contain more information when the information content of the input is increased. Formally, this means that we want a function to be monotonic.

When dealing with dcpos, one might also want computations to be compatible with the formation of limits of a directed set. Formally, this means that, for some function &quot;f&quot;, the image &quot;f&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) of a directed set &quot;D&quot; (i.e. the set of the images of each element of &quot;D&quot;) is again directed and has as a least upper bound the image of the least upper bound of &quot;D&quot;. One could also say that &quot;f&quot; &quot;preserves directed suprema&quot;. Also note that, by considering directed sets of two elements, such a function also has to be monotonic. These properties give rise to the notion of a Scott-continuous function. Since this often is not ambiguous one also may speak of &quot;continuous functions&quot;.

=== Approximation and finiteness ===
Domain theory is a purely &quot;qualitative&quot; approach to modeling the structure of information states. One can say that something contains more information, but the amount of additional information is not specified. Yet, there are some situations in which one wants to speak about elements that are in a sense much simpler (or much more incomplete) than a given state of information. For example, in the natural subset-inclusion ordering on some powerset, any infinite element (i.e. set) is much more &quot;informative&quot; than any of its &quot;finite&quot; subsets.

If one wants to model such a relationship, one may first want to consider the induced strict order &lt; of a domain with order ≤. However, while this is a useful notion in the case of total orders, it does not tell us much in the case of partially ordered sets. Considering again inclusion-orders of sets, a set is already strictly smaller than another, possibly infinite, set if it contains just one less element. One would, however, hardly agree that this captures the notion of being &quot;much simpler&quot;.

===Way-below relation===
A more elaborate approach leads to the definition of the so-called order of approximation, which is more suggestively also called the way-below relation. An element &quot;x&quot; is &quot;way below&quot; an element &quot;y&quot;, if, for every directed set &quot;D&quot; with supremum such that

:formula_1,

there is some element &quot;d&quot; in &quot;D&quot; such that

:formula_2.

Then one also says that &quot;x&quot; &quot;approximates&quot; &quot;y&quot; and writes

:formula_3.

This does imply that

:formula_4,

since the singleton set {&quot;y&quot;} is directed. For an example, in an ordering of sets, an infinite set is way above any of its finite subsets. On the other hand, consider the directed set (in fact, the chain) of finite sets

:formula_5

Since the supremum of this chain is the set of all natural numbers N, this shows that no infinite set is way below N.

However, being way below some element is a &quot;relative&quot; notion and does not reveal much about an element alone. For example, one would like to characterize finite sets in an order-theoretic way, but even infinite sets can be way below some other set. The special property of these finite elements &quot;x&quot; is that they are way below themselves, i.e.

:formula_6.

An element with this property is also called compact. Yet, such elements do not have to be &quot;finite&quot; nor &quot;compact&quot; in any other mathematical usage of the terms. The notation is nonetheless motivated by certain parallels to the respective notions in set theory and topology. The compact elements of a domain have the important special property that they cannot be obtained as a limit of a directed set in which they did not already occur.

Many other important results about the way-below relation support the claim that this definition is appropriate to capture many important aspects of a domain.

=== Bases of domains ===
The previous thoughts raise another question: is it possible to guarantee that all elements of a domain can be obtained as a limit of much simpler elements? This is quite relevant in practice, since we cannot compute infinite objects but we may still hope to approximate them arbitrarily closely.

More generally, we would like to restrict to a certain subset of elements as being sufficient for getting all other elements as least upper bounds. Hence, one defines a base of a poset &quot;P&quot; as being a subset &quot;B&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, such that, for each &quot;x&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, the set of elements in &quot;B&quot; that are way below &quot;x&quot; contains a directed set with supremum &quot;x&quot;. The poset &quot;P&quot; is a continuous poset if it has some base. Especially, &quot;P&quot; itself is a base in this situation. In many applications, one restricts to continuous (d)cpos as a main object of study.

Finally, an even stronger restriction on a partially ordered set is given by requiring the existence of a base of &quot;finite&quot; elements. Such a poset is called algebraic. From the viewpoint of denotational semantics, algebraic posets are particularly well-behaved, since they allow for the approximation of all elements even when restricting to finite ones. As remarked before, not every finite element is &quot;finite&quot; in a classical sense and it may well be that the finite elements constitute an uncountable set.

In some cases, however, the base for a poset is countable. In this case, one speaks of an ω-continuous poset. Accordingly, if the countable base consists entirely of finite elements, we obtain an order that is ω-algebraic.

=== Special types of domains ===
A simple special case of a domain is known as an elementary or flat domain. This consists of a set of incomparable elements, such as the integers, along with a single &quot;bottom&quot; element considered smaller than all other elements.

One can obtain a number of other interesting special classes of ordered structures that could be suitable as &quot;domains&quot;. We already mentioned continuous posets and algebraic posets. More special versions of both are continuous and algebraic cpos. Adding even further completeness properties one obtains continuous lattices and algebraic lattices, which are just complete lattices with the respective properties. For the algebraic case, one finds broader classes of posets that are still worth studying: historically, the Scott domains were the first structures to be studied in domain theory. Still wider classes of domains are constituted by SFP-domains, L-domains, and bifinite domains.

All of these classes of orders can be cast into various categories of dcpos, using functions that are monotone, Scott-continuous, or even more specialized as morphisms. Finally, note that the term &quot;domain&quot; itself is not exact and thus is only used as an abbreviation when a formal definition has been given before or when the details are irrelevant.

== Important results ==
A poset &quot;D&quot; is a dcpo if and only if each chain in &quot;D&quot; has a supremum. (The &#x27;if&#x27; direction relies on the axiom of choice.)

If &quot;f&quot; is a continuous function on a domain &quot;D&quot; then it has a least fixed point, given as the least upper bound of all finite iterations of &quot;f&quot; on the least element ⊥:

:formula_7.

This is the Kleene fixed-point theorem. The formula_8 symbol is the directed join.

==Generalizations==
A continuity space is a generalization of metric spaces and posets that can be used to unify the notions of metric spaces and domains.

<doc id="325078" wikidata="Q1148591" url="?curid=325078" title="Cyril Cusack">
<text>Cyril James Cusack (26 November 1910 – 7 October 1993) was an Irish stage and screen actor with a career that spanned more than 70 years. During his lifetime, he was considered one of Ireland&#x27;s finest thespians, and was renowned for his interpretations of both classical and contemporary theatre, including Shakespearean roles as a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, and over 60 productions for the Abbey Theatre, of which he was a lifelong member. In 2020, Cusack was ranked at number 14 on &quot;The Irish Times&quot;″ list of Ireland&#x27;s greatest film actors.

Born to an English mother and Irish father in South Africa and raised in County Tipperary, Cusack dropped out of law school to join the Abbey Theatre and remained with the company for 13 years, acting in over 60 plays. In London, he performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre, and later founded his own company which toured across Europe. Making his film debut at age 8, Cusack worked with many great directors, including Powell and Pressburger, Franco Zefferelli, François Truffaut, Carol Reed, Peter Brook, Peter Hall, Fred Zinnemann, Christine Edzard and Anthony Harvey. He co-starred opposite Richard Burton several times, who once commended Cusack&#x27;s acting as &quot;always himself and yet always totally different&quot;. Fluent in both English and Irish, Cusack had a starring role in the first Irish-language feature film, &quot;Poitín&quot; (1978).

He was the patriarch of the Cusack acting family, as the father of Sinéad Cusack, Sorcha Cusack, Niamh Cusack, Pádraig Cusack, and Catherine Cusack.

==Early life and education==
Cusack was born in Durban, Natal, South Africa. His mother, Alice Violet (née Cole), was an English Cockney actress and chorus girl, and his father, James Walter Cusack, was an Irish mounted policeman in Natal Colony, South Africa. His parents separated when he was young and his mother took him to England, and then to Ireland. Cusack&#x27;s mother and her partner, Brefni O&#x27;Rorke, joined the O&#x27;Brien and Ireland Players.

Cyril made his first stage performance at the age of seven. He was educated at Newbridge College in Newbridge, County Kildare, then read law at University College Dublin. He left without a degree and joined the Abbey Theatre in 1932.

==Career==

=== Stage ===
Between then and 1945, he performed in over 60 productions for the Abbey, particularly excelling in the plays of Seán O&#x27;Casey. He also performed in plays by Irish playwright Teresa Deevy &quot;Katie Roche&quot; and &quot;The King of Spain&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. In 1932 he also joined the Gate Theatre company, appearing with them in many notable productions over the years. In 1947, Cusack formed his own company, Cyril Cusack Productions, and staged productions in Dublin, Paris and New York.

In 1963, Cusack joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in London and appeared there for several seasons. By this stage he had established a successful career in films, which had started at the age of eight. The same year, Cusack won a Jacob&#x27;s Award for his performance in the Telefís Éireann production of &quot;Triptych&quot;.

Cusack&#x27;s favorite roles included The Covery in &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; and Christy Mahon in &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot;, which he reprised numerous times.

Cusack&#x27;s last stage performance was in Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; (1990), in which three of his daughters played the sisters.

=== Film and television ===
Cusack made his film debut in &quot;Knocknagow&quot; (1918), when he was only 8. His breakthrough role was as a wiry IRA getaway driver opposite James Mason in Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; (1947).

Cusack played the titular role in the &quot;Galileo&quot; (1968), which was the directorial debut of Italian filmmaker Liliana Cavani. Cusack returned to Italy several times throughout his career, particularly in the 1970s, both acting on-camera and working as a voice artist, helping create English-language dubs of Italian films.

Cusack, who was bilingual in English and Irish, had a leading part in the controversial Irish language film &quot;Poitín&quot; (1977).

One of his final appearances came in 1989, when he appeared as the elderly Dr Spencer in Danny, the Champion of the World alongside his son-in-law Jeremy Irons and his grandson Samuel.

==Personal life==
Cusack was twice married:
*The actress Mary Margaret &quot;Maureen&quot; Kiely (1920–1977), on 5 April 1945
::Paul (1946) worked as a producer with RTÉSinéad (1948) actressSorcha (1949) actressNiamh (1959) actressPádraig (1962) associate producer at the National Theatre in London.
*Mary Rose Cunningham (1979–1993)
* Catherine, actress, born 1968, is his daughter.

Cusack was a strong supporter of Irish nationalism, and often selected projects based on those beliefs. In later life, Cusack became a campaigner for conservative causes in Ireland, notably in his opposition to abortion, where he became a frequent letter-writer to the main liberal Irish newspaper, &quot;The Irish Times&quot;.

Regarding his Catholic faith, he commented &quot;Religion promotes the divine discontent within oneself, so that one tries to make oneself a better person and draw oneself closer to God.&quot; His religious credentials came under scrutiny following his death and the revelation that he had been unfaithful in his first marriage, with a long-term mistress, Mary Rose Cunningham, who bore him a daughter, Catherine. Cusack married Cunningham following his first wife&#x27;s death.

Cusack received honorary doctorate in 1977 from the NUI and 1980, from the University of Dublin.

Cusack was a longtime friend of Irish attorney general, Chief Justice and President of Ireland Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, whom he got to know when they were students at University College Dublin in the early 1930s.

Cusack is the maternal grandfather of Irish Socialist Workers Party TD Richard Boyd Barrett and English actor Max Irons.

==Death==
In October 1993, Cusack died at home in Chiswick, Greater London, from MND.

<doc id="325080" wikidata="Q1208899" url="?curid=325080" title="Finnicization">
<text>Finnicization (also finnicisation, fennicization, fennicisation) is the changing of one&#x27;s personal names from other languages (usually Swedish) into Finnish. During the era of National Romanticism in Finland, many people, especially Fennomans, finnicized their previously Swedish family names.

Some of these people were descended from Finnish-speaking farmers, who had previously changed their Finnish names to Swedish ones after climbing society&#x27;s ladder. This was an understandable stratagem, as official positions (and even many trades) were only open to those speaking Swedish, and a Finnish name would have been an impediment to success.

A notable event in finnicization was the centenary, in 1906, 100 years after the birth of the philosopher and statesman Johan Vilhelm Snellman. Author Johannes Linnankoski encouraged Finns to give up their Swedish names on 12 May, Snellman&#x27;s birthday. During 1906 and 1907 about 70,000 Finns changed their names.

In 1935 also 74,064 persons changed their family name and in the following year 24,000 more. A law to facilitate changing one&#x27;s family name was passed in 1934.

The 1906-1907 name change process in Finland was an example for Estonianizing family names in Estonia. Although the law enabled that since 1919, the mass changes took place at the same time than the second wave in Finland, in 1935-1940, and a similar law to facilitate changing one&#x27;s family name was passed just two weeks earlier than in Finland. During that time 195,000 persons or 17% of the Estonian population changed their family name.

<doc id="325091" wikidata="Q7428836" url="?curid=325091" title="Saxon Motor Car Company">
<text>The Saxon Motor Car Company was located in Detroit, Michigan, from 1914 to 1922. In 1917, 28,000 cars were made, making it the seventh largest car maker in the United States.

== History ==
Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Motor Car Company began the company to market a low priced volume car. The first Saxon was a 2-seat runabout with 2-speed transmission and a four-cylinder engine made by Ferro and built in the old Demotcar factory. 7,000 were made in the first year of production. The cost of a Saxon in 1913 was $395, . 

From 1913 to 1914, electric lighting was an extra option, which became a standard fitting to the car in 1915. Also available in 1915 was the Saxon Six, a five-passenger tourer, with a 30–35 hp (22–26 kW) Continental six-cylinder, electric starter and headlights, on a 112 in (2845 mm) wheelbase and 32×3½-inch (81×8.9 cm) wheels, all for $785, . 

In 1914 a Saxon roadster was driven 135 miles a day for 30 days, for a total of 4,050 miles with an average of 30 mpg. It was among the first cars to christen the new Lincoln Highway. Sales skyrocketed. In 1915, Harry W. Ford, formerly with Chalmers, bought out Hugh Chalmers interest and became President of a reorganized Saxon Motor Car Corporation. Early in 1915, Saxon moved production to the former Abbott factory. 

In its peak year of 1916, 27,800 Saxons were produced. The Saxon Six was followed in 1917 by a Sedan. In December 1917, Harry W. Ford was out and the new president was Benjamin Gotfredson. From 1918 the company got into financial difficulties while expanding, with large quantities of parts and building a larger factory. The 4-cylinder models were dropped from the range and the Sedan went as well in 1919. 

In 1919 C. A. Pfeffer, another former Chalmers manager, became president of Saxon Motor Car Corporation. The new factory Saxon couldn&#x27;t pay for was sold to General Motors. In 1920 a new model, the Saxon Duplex, powered by an overhead-valve, four-cylinder engine joined the six-cylinder model and a sedan body rejoined the range. The six-cylinder cars were no longer listed after 1921 and production had fallen to 2,100 cars.

In 1921, Saxon sold off their parts business to settle debts and used the proceeds to move the company to Ypsilanti, Michigan, where the cars were made in the Ace car plant, but this could not save the company and the last cars, probably made in 1922, were sold in 1923.

==In popular culture==
Band leader George Olsen drove a Saxon. Olsen mentions this on the first Jack Benny Program, May 2, 1932. Olsen was the bandleader on that show.

In the 1937 Hollywood film &quot;Easy Living&quot;, Jean Arthur&#x27;s character, a poor woman mistakenly thought to be rich, is asked to buy a car from the V16 Company of America, and answers that &quot;of course I&#x27;ve never driven one; we had Saxon&#x27;s... Yes I suppose they are different.&quot;

It has been misreported that Saxon President Harry Ford left the company due to illness. The fact is that after raising capital for the company, Ford lost his position in a proxy fight. He subsequently joined the war effort as an officer, and died while a military officer during the influenza epidemic.

<text>Shankill () is an outlying suburb of Dublin, Ireland, on the southeast of County Dublin, close to the border with County Wicklow. It is in the local government area of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown and had a population of 14,257 as of the 2016 census. It runs from the coast, between Loughlinstown and Bray, inland towards the foothills of the Dublin Mountains. Shankill borders Rathmichael, as well as Loughlinstown, Killiney, Ballybrack and Bray in County Wicklow. It is part of the civil parish of Rathmichael and contains the formerly separate district of Shanganagh, and in its southern parts, the locality of Crinken.

==Etymology==
The name Shankill derives from the Irish , meaning &quot;Old Church&quot;.

==Geography==
The townland of Shankill was originally located on lands further northwest at Puck&#x27;s Castle but today the area of Shankill is usually understood to lie towards the coast, while the inland reaches form Rathmichael (historically Shankill was absorbed into Rathmichael civil parish), with an area of around . Carrickgollogan Hill (278m) lies to the west, with the Ballycorus Leadmines to the northwest, and Loughlinstown and Killiney to the north. The town of Bray, County Wicklow lies to the south.

==History==
===Early history===
Shankill features a number of antiquities, including ráths and cromlechs.

Around 1230, there were forests that were cleared under the orders of the then-owner of Shankill, Archbishop Luke. Courts for serious crimes in the style of assizes were conducted at Shankill during this period. To keep the native Gaelic Irish out, barriers and fortified gates protected parts of the townland. The manor of Shankill was overrun by the native Irish and completely destroyed a century later. In response to these incursions, a large garrison was re-instated. The Irish were restrained from entering and the land was eventually re-let as grazing land.

===Middle Ages===
The Lawless family features prominently in the history of Shankill. In 1408, family members took control of the seigniory of Shanganagh and, by 1480, several branches of the family were residents of Shankill.

Between 1400 and 1600, a number of fortified structures - whose remains can still be seen to this day in Shankill and Rathmichael - were built: Shankill Castle, Shanganagh Castle and a strong house known locally as Puck&#x27;s Castle. The Walsh family, which came to prominence in the 16th century, built several further defensive structures in Shankill.

From 1640 onwards, the native Irish were subdued in a series of confrontations, leading to greater agricultural use of the lands. Around this time, Shankill was absorbed into the parish of Rathmichael.

The Walshes quit the lands of Shankill primarily due to the Act of Commonwealth which redistributed landowners and tenancies. After this, the Lawless families regained possession for the third time of lands around Shankill. The last Lawless died in 1795, whereupon the lands became the possession of the third Sir William Domvile, resident of nearby Loughlinstown House. The Domvile family had been granted the lands surrounding Loughlinstown under the Restoration.

===19th century===
====The Domviles====
Shankill and Rathmichael were the property of Sir Charles Compton William Domvile (1822–1884). Domvile was known as an uncompromising and ruthless landlord and sought to change the usage of land from the smallholdings that existed at the time of his inheritance of the estate. At this time Shankill was a rural village, but Domvile intended to build grand Georgian-style housing developments, squares and streets to gentrify the area, thereby making it attractive for wealthy Dublin city-based professionals to live in. During Domvile&#x27;s time, new roads and streets were laid out, as well as water mains which feed a relief tank from Vartry Reservoir, continuing on to Stillorgan reservoir. However, Domvile was an impetuous man and acted unreasonably with his tenants and prospective buyers of estates on his holdings. His personal debts mounted as a result of his financing two large estates at Shankill and Santry, ultimately resulting in his bankruptcy.

The net outcome of Domvile&#x27;s actions was to halve the population of Shankill and Rathmichael during the 1860s. He evicted over 100 tenants, during a period of grinding poverty, and many were forced to re-negotiate their tenancies at usurious rates. Many of the evicted ended up in the local workhouse, the Rathdown Work Union, which is now the site of Loughlinstown Hospital.

====The new Shankill====
A landowner with holdings adjacent to the Shankill townland, Benjamin Tilly, granted quarter-acre holdings to some of the evicted tenants. Tilly&#x27;s land straddled the townland border into Shanganagh, and thus the new holdings along the Shanganagh Road became known as &#x27;Tillystown&#x27;. In 1871, there were over 60 houses, and around the start of the 20th century, this village became known as Shankill proper.

In 1911, a tract of land to the west of Shankill, known as &#x27;New Vale&#x27;, was developed as labourers&#x27; cottages.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Shankill initially comprised large agricultural tracts broken into smallholdings for tenant farmers, and larger, grander estates with fine country houses, many of which still exist today. Large housing estates have been built on many of these estates. Additional tracts of land were also sold to developers who have built higher-density housing than the larger-plot housing estates constructed in the 1970s.

==Local antiquities and features==

There are several antiquities in the area, including ruined churches and standing stones. The ruins of several castles and defensive-type structures remain, including Puck&#x27;s Castle, Shankill Castle, Shanganagh Castle and a Martello Tower.

Some houses of architectural note include: &quot;Clontra&quot;, a coastal Gothic mansion near Corbawn Wood and Quinn&#x27;s Road; Crinken Castle House, Crinken, and Shanganagh House, a large mansion now surrounded by local authority housing estates. Clontra was built for Dublin barrister James Anthony Lawson QC (later Attorney General of Ireland, Judge of the High Court and Privy Councillor) and designed by the 19th-century architects Sir Thomas Newenham Deane and Benjamin Woodward in their trademark Italian medieval style.

The local library was formerly a courthouse built in the Victorian style of granite and mock Tudor features. There are also some follies such as a mock round tower built of red brick in the Castle Farm Farmyard.

Evidence of local industrial activity include the lead-mine chimney at Ballycorus. Other features include the &#x27;upside down&#x27; houses by the Harcourt Street railway line bridge, which was the site of the original post office, and has its guest rooms downstairs, and its kitchen and living room upstairs. Shankill was accessible via the original Kingstown-Bray train line, which is now five metres from the sea in some places. A coastal wall was built from Killiney to Bray to try to stop the erosion, traces of which can still be seen along the beach. The medieval village of Longnon was sited some east of Quinn&#x27;s Road beach but was obliterated by coastal erosion.

===Buildings===
====Ballycorus Leadmines====

Site of a lead ore smelter, a mile-long stone flue and a granite chimney on Carrickgollogan hill, which is visible from much of southeast Dublin.

====Carnegie Library====
Tudor-style library, architect R. M. Butler, 1912.

====Clonasleigh====
Clonasleigh, a house replaced by Shankill Shopping Centre (since upgraded and re-opened) was lived in by Frederick W. Meredith, once President of the Law Society, in the early 1900s. The name has been retained locally in Clonasleigh, a road with 16 houses, off Corbawn Lane, located close to the original house.

====Clontra====
Gothic mansion designed by Deane and Woodward, 1860, interior murals by John Hungerford Pollen. On of parkland by the coast, adjacent to Corbawn Wood estate.

====Dorney Court====
Originally called Clare Mount, built c. 1832, this fine Victorian house was demolished in 1984. Its site is now that of Shankill Garda Station. The grounds still contain a few Sequoia and Scots Pine trees following the felling of many of them in 1984.

====Ferndale House====
Large estate on several acres, the seat of David Plunket, 1st Baron Rathmore.

====Mullinastill House====
The former mill house is a listed structure and the set for several film scenes.

====Puck&#x27;s Castle====

The &#x27;castle&#x27;, actually a fortified house, was built in the late 16th century. It provided a refuge in 1690 for James II and his army fleeing the Battle of the Boyne. One explanation for its name is that a ghost or &quot;puca&quot; inhabited the castle. In June 1867 the daughter of a local Englishman disappeared near the castle. Jane Eleanor Sherrard, daughter of Henry and Margaret Sherrard left her nearby home to pick flowers for the dinner table. When she failed to return home that evening the police were notified and a widespread search was conducted. The last confirmed sighting of Jane was by the local postman, who reported to have seen her picking flowers at the foot of the castle&#x27;s northern wall. To this day the circumstances surrounding her disappearance remain unknown.

====Rathmichael Church====

Commissioned by Charles Domvile in 1860, and designed by Benjamin Woodward, in the Hiberno-Romanesque style. The Domviles had their own high-backed chairs, behind red velvet curtains.

==== Shanganagh Bridge (1829) ====

Located at the junction of Commons Road and Shanganagh Road this bridge bears the worn inscription: &quot;Built 1829 - Robert Day Thomas Bourchier Esq&#x27;s - Overseers Myles Bready - Mason&quot;.

Robert Day, judge and MP, lived in Loughlinstown House. Day had a long career from the 1780s through to the 1830s. He was a member of King&#x27;s Inns, and also of the Royal Dublin Society. Thomas Bourchier, Deputy Clerk of the Crown in the Irish House of Commons, lived in Killiney Castle, now the Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel, which is on the same road as Shanganagh Bridge. Bourchier died in 1832.

==== Shanganagh Castle (1408) ====
Located near Mill Lane, at the northern margins of the area, built in 1408 by the Lawless family and inhabited by their descendants until 1763, the castle was left in ruins by a fire in 1783. Only limited elements remain within the grounds of a later house.

====Shanganagh Castle (18th century)====
Several kilometres from the first Shanganagh Castle, during the late 18th century, a mansion was built on extensive lands running to the border of Shankill with County Wicklow. It was later used as an open prison for juveniles between 1969 and 2002. The site is now being developed by the local authority and Land Development Agency, with over 500 housing units planned, and the castle will be restored and reopened.

====Shanganagh House====

Later called Shanganagh Park, this Georgian-era mansion was built c. 1823 for William Hopper. Later residents included the Darcy brewing family and racehorse breeder Frank Field. It was compulsorily purchased by Dublin County Council in 1970; it now serves as a community centre and is surrounded by late 1970s council houses.

====Shankill Castle====
Built by Archbishop Henry de Loundres in 1229; site of the ancient Shankill church. It is one of the oldest surviving structures in the area.

===Infrastructure===
====Old Dublin &amp; South East railway line====
The Dublin and South Eastern Railway ran along the coast, seaward from the modern DART and railway line, connecting Killiney and Bray.

====Old Harcourt Street line====
The former railroad running from Dublin to Bray on an inland route; closed in 1958. The D&amp;SER and Harcourt Street railway line met at Shanganagh Junction.

====Defunct link line====
The Harcourt Street line continued seawards to meet the original D&amp;SER line at Tyrell&#x27;s land; this link closed in 1915 when the Shanganagh Diversion came into service.

====The new D&amp;SER line (modern line)====
The coastal line was moved inland, from Ballybrack to Wood Glen, due to coastal erosion, the new line, the &quot;Shanganagh Diversion&quot;, opened on 1 October 1915. A new connection to the Harcourt Street line was made at a new Shanganagh Junction, and stations were reworked.

====Sanitation====

A sanitation pole in Shankill Village bears the cast lettering &#x27;R.No.1 R.D.C. 1911&#x27;. Rural Districts were administrative divisions created in 1899. This inscription refers to the then Rathdown No.1 administrative district (as distinct from Rathdown No.2 district south of Bray). The two Rathdown districts were abolished in 1930 and 1925 respectively.

==Amenities==
===Education===
Shankill has 3 primary schools; Scoil Mhuire (Roman Catholic), Rathmichael Parish School (Church of Ireland) and Saint Anne&#x27;s National School (Roman Catholic).

===Religion===
Shankill has one Roman Catholic church, St Anne&#x27;s, and a Church of Ireland (Anglican) church, St James&#x27;, at Crinken (to the south), and Rathmichael, which has had a church for more than 800 years, also has a Church of Ireland church, simply named for the area.

===Retail===

Shankill is served by a convenience store, takeaway restaurants, bookmakers, barbers, pharmacies, hairdressers and beauty salon and a Lidl shopping centre. The local credit union has an office on the main street. There is also a public library.
==Sport and leisure==

===Walking===
The trailhead of the Dublin Mountains Way, a long-distance walking route (43  km trail) across the Dublin Mountains between Shankill and Tallaght begins on the main street.

===Football===
Local soccer teams include Shankill FC, which has schoolboy and schoolgirl sides.

===Tennis===
Shankill Tennis Club, which opened a new clubhouse in 2007 and indoor courts in 2016, is located at the junction of Quinn&#x27;s Road and Corbawn Drive.

===GAA===
Shankill GAA Club re-formed in 2013 after a 20-year absence. As of 2021 the club fielded approximately 30 teams across Gaelic football, hurling and camogie in both underage and adult teams.

===Sailing===
In about 1877, a sailing club was formed at the end of Corbawn Lane called the Shankill Corinthian Sailing Club for the promotion and encouragement of amateur seamanship. The membership came from the residents of the houses in the immediate vicinity. They sailed in small open boats without centre-boards or keels which were light enough to be pulled up on the beach by two men. The club survived for more than 10 years before many of the members relocated their sailing activities to Kingstown.

==Awards==
In 2007, Shankill won the &#x27;National Best Urban Village&#x27; award and two other awards in the Tidy Towns Competition.

==Shankill, Belfast==
Like its namesake the Shankill district of Belfast, Dublin&#x27;s Shankill also has its own Falls Road. Occasionally, the primary schools and community groups in both Shankills hold football or other sporting events to promote closer north–south ties.

==Transport==

===Bus===
Dublin Bus routes 7b and E1 connect Shankill with the city centre. The Go-Ahead Ireland routes 45a and 45b connect the area to Kilmacanogue and Dún Laoghaire.

The Aircoach service from Greystones to Dublin airport also stops at the main street Dublin Bus stop, although originally it was planned to stop outside Brady&#x27;s of Shankill (aka Mickey Byrne&#x27;s Bar; the stop still has this name despite being approximately 50 metres from the pub itself), to the airport.

===Rail===

Shankill station - located between Rathsallagh Park and Corbawn Lane - is the third-last stop on the southbound leg of Dublin&#x27;s DART line.

The original Shankill station was on the Harcourt Street line, which opened following the opening of the Dublin and Wicklow Railway in 1854. The line closed in 1958, and the current station in Shankill opened in 1977.

===Luas===
The closest Luas stops (Green Line) are at Cherrywood and Brides Glen, with connections to Dublin city centre (Parnell) and Broombridge. There have been plans to extend the Green Line to the station in Bray, which if they went ahead as planned, would mean the line would pass through Shankill. However these plans are dormant for now.

===Road===
The N11 national route used to run through Shankill, until the M11 bypass was built nearby. The area can now be accessed via coastal roads, from the M11, or by a road at Crinken which overflies the M11.

<doc id="325110" wikidata="Q319664" url="?curid=325110" title="Tokugawa Yoshimune">
<text>was the eighth &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan, ruling from 1716 until his abdication in 1745. He was the son of Tokugawa Mitsusada, the grandson of Tokugawa Yorinobu, and the great-grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Yoshimune is known for repealing the ban on Western literature.

==Lineage==
Yoshimune was not the son of any former &quot;shōgun&quot;. Rather, he was a member of a cadet branch of the Tokugawa clan. Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate, well aware of the extinction of the Minamoto line in 1219, had realized that his direct descendants might die out, leaving the Tokugawa family at risk of extinction. Thus, while his son Tokugawa Hidetada was the second &quot;shōgun&quot;, he selected three other sons to establish the &quot;gosanke,&quot; hereditary houses which would provide a &quot;shōgun&quot; if there were no male heir. The three &quot;gosanke&quot; were the Owari, Kii, and Mito branches.

Yoshimune was from the branch of Kii. The founder of the Kii house was one of Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s sons, Tokugawa Yorinobu. Ieyasu appointed him &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kii. Yorinobu&#x27;s son, Tokugawa Mitsusada, succeeded him. Two of Mitsusada&#x27;s sons succeeded him, and when they died, Tokugawa Yoshimune, Mitsusada&#x27;s fourth son, became &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kii in 1705. Later, he became &quot;shōgun&quot;.

Yoshimune was closely related to the Tokugawa &quot;shōguns&quot;. His grandfather, Tokugawa Yorinobu, was a brother of second &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Hidetada, while Yoshimune&#x27;s father, Tokugawa Mitsusada, was a first cousin of third &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Iemitsu. Yoshimune thus was a second cousin to the fourth and fifth &quot;shōguns&quot; (both brothers) Tokugawa Ietsuna and Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, as well as a second cousin to Tokugawa Tsunashige, whose son became &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ienobu.

==Early life (1684–1716)==
Tokugawa Yoshimune was born in 1684 in the rich Kii Province, a region which was then ruled by his father, Tokugawa Mitsusada. Yoshimune&#x27;s childhood name was Tokugawa Genroku (徳川 源六). At that time, his second cousin Tokugawa Tsunayoshi was ruling in Edo as &quot;shōgun&quot;. Kii was a rich region of over 500,000 &quot;koku,&quot; but it was still in debt and had a lot to pay back to the shogunate.

In 1697, Genroku underwent the rites of passage and took the name Tokugawa Shinnosuke (徳川 新之助). In 1705, when Shinnosuke was just 21 years old, his father Mitsusada and two older brothers died. Thus, the ruling &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Tsunayoshi appointed him &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kii. He took the name Tokugawa Yorimasa (頼方) and began to administer the province. Nonetheless, great financial debt which the domain had owed to the shogunate since his father&#x27;s and even grandfather&#x27;s time continued to burden the finances. What made things worse was that in 1707, a tsunami destroyed and killed many in the coastal areas of Kii Province. Yorimasa did his best to try to stabilize things in Kii, but relied on leadership from Edo.

In 1712, Shogun Ienobu died, and was succeeded by his son, the boy-&quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ietsugu. Yorimasa decided that he could not rely on conservative Confucianists like Arai Hakuseki in Edo and did what he could to stabilize Kii Domain. Before he could implement changes, &quot;shōgun&quot; Ietsugu died in early 1716. He was only seven years old, and died without an heir. The bakufu thus selected the next &quot;shōgun&quot; from one of the cadet lines.

==&quot;Shōgun&quot; (1716–1745)==
Yoshimune succeeded to the post of the &quot;shōgun&quot; in Shōtoku-1 (1716). His term as &quot;shōgun&quot; lasted for 30 years. He is considered among the best of the Tokugawa &quot;shōguns&quot;.

Yoshimune established the &quot;gosankyō&quot; to augment (or perhaps to replace) the &quot;gosanke&quot;. Two of his sons, together with the second son of his successor Ieshige, became the founders of the Tayasu, Hitotsubashi and Shimizu lines. Unlike the &quot;gosanke,&quot; they did not rule domains. Still, they remained prominent until the end of Tokugawa rule, and some later &quot;shōguns&quot; were chosen from the Hitotsubashi line.

Yoshimune is known for his financial reforms. He dismissed the conservative adviser Arai Hakuseki and he began what would come to be known as the Kyōhō Reforms.

Yoshimune also tried to resurrect the Japanese swordsmithing tradition. Since the beginning of the Edo period, it was quite difficult for smiths to make a living and to be supported by &quot;daimyōs&quot;, because of the lack of funds. But Yoshimune was quite unhappy with this situation, causing a decline of skills. And so, he gathered smiths from &quot;daimyō&quot; fiefs for a great contest, in 1721. The four winners who emerged were all great masters, Mondo no Shō Masakiyo (主水正正清), Ippei Yasuyo (一平安代), the 4th generation Nanki Shigekuni (南紀重国) and Nobukuni Shigekane (信国重包). But it did not work well to arouse interest, quite like tournaments in modern Japan.

Yoshimune also ordered the compilation of &quot;Kyōhō Meibutsu Chō&quot; (享保名物帳), listing the best and most famous swords all over Japan. This book allowed the beginning of the Shinshintō period of Nihontō history, and indirectly contributed to the Gassan school, who protected the Nihontō tradition before and after the surrender of Japan.

Although foreign books had been strictly forbidden since 1640, Yoshimune relaxed the rules in 1720, starting an influx of foreign books and their translations into Japan, and initiating the development of Western studies, or &quot;rangaku&quot;. Yoshimune&#x27;s relaxation of the rules may have been influenced by a series of lectures delivered before him by the astronomer and philosopher Nishikawa Joken. Engravement or official sanction of Chinese medical volume Taiping Huìmín Héjì Júfāng 『太平恵民和剤局方』 appears to have happened around this time.

==&quot;Ōgosho&quot; (1745–1751)==
In 1745, Yoshimune retired, took the title &quot;Ōgosho&quot; and left his public post to his oldest son. The title is the one that Tokugawa Ieyasu took on retirement in favor of his son Hidetada, who in turn took the same title on his retirement.

Yoshimune died on the 20th day of the 5th month of the year Kan&#x27;en-4 (12 July 1751). His Buddhist name was Yutokuin and he was buried in Kan&#x27;ei-ji.

==Eras of Yoshimune&#x27;s rule==
The years in which Yoshimune was &quot;shōgun&quot; are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* Shōtoku (1711–1716)
* Kyōhō (1716–1736)
* Genbun (1736–1741)
* Kanpō (1741–1744)
* Enkyō (1744–1748)

<text>The Capitol Limited is a temporarily discontinued daily Amtrak train between Washington, D.C., and Chicago, running via Pittsburgh and Cleveland. Service began in 1981. On November 10, 2024, Amtrak temporarily combined the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; and , producing a Chicago-Washington–Miami route, the .

The train was named for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Capitol Limited,&quot; which ended in 1971 upon the formation of Amtrak. It carried the Amtrak train numbers 29 and 30, which were previously assigned to the discontinued &quot;National Limited&quot;.

During fiscal year 2023, the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; carried 167,713 passengers, down 24.7% from FY2022.

== History ==
On October 1, 1981, Amtrak stopped running the &quot;Shenandoah,&quot; which connected Washington, D.C., and Cincinnati, Ohio, and began running the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot;. Amtrak&#x27;s version of the CL ran over the same route as the B&amp;O&#x27;s train east of Pittsburgh, but west of Pittsburgh it ran combined with the Chicago-New York &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; over the former Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway. Its numbers, 440 (eastbound) and 441 (westbound), were derived from the &quot;Broadway Limited&#x27;s&quot; 40 and 41 and the new train also used Heritage Fleet equipment. The new train replaced the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot;&#x27;s former Washington section which had diverged at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In late 1984, the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; re-equipped with new Amfleet II coaches but also lost its full diner east of Pittsburgh.

Beginning with the October 26, 1986, timetable, Amtrak split up the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; and &quot;Broadway Limited&quot;. The &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; continued to operate over the same route, regained a full diner east of Pittsburgh (which it had lost in 1984), received new train numbers (29 and 30, which had been assigned to the defunct &quot;National Limited&quot;), and a later schedule.

On November 12, 1990, trains were rerouted west of Alliance, Ohio, due to Conrail&#x27;s desire to abandon part of the former PFW&amp;C in northwestern Indiana; the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; now uses the former Pennsylvania Railroad Cleveland and Pittsburgh (C&amp;P) line north from Alliance through Hudson, Ohio, to Cleveland route. The &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; and its successor, the &quot;Three Rivers&quot;, were re-routed over the B&amp;O&#x27;s Chicago-Pittsburgh route. In October 1994, Amtrak, with great fanfare, relaunched the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; with a new bilevel Superliner II consist, and a further rerouting over the former New York Central Water Level Route. This new alignment took the &quot;Capitol&quot; through Cleveland, Toledo, and Elkhart, IN, which remains the case today.

On February 16, 1996, an eastbound rush-hour MARC commuter train headed to Washington Union Station collided with the westbound &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; near Georgetown Junction on a snow-covered stretch of track just west of Silver Spring, Maryland. Eleven people died aboard the MARC train in the accident. Three died of injuries suffered in the impact; the rest were killed by smoke and flames. The MARC engineer and two conductors were among the dead.

In November 2014, Amtrak, in the face of extreme delays, filed a complaint with the Surface Transportation Board, against CSX and Norfolk Southern, due to the frequency of extreme delays caused by freight train interference.

On April 19, 2018, Amtrak announced that it would discontinue full-service dining aboard the train on June 1. Instead of hot meals prepared on the train and served to diners in the dining car, sleeper passengers were now served a selection of primarily cold pre-packaged boxed meals, served in a &quot;Sleeper Lounge&quot;. In January 2019, Amtrak expanded the boxed meal service to offer a full continental buffet at breakfast (with hot options such as oatmeal and breakfast sandwiches), and multiple hot entrées for lunch and dinner.

In October 2020, Amtrak temporarily reduced service on all long-distance routes, including the Capitol Limited, to three days per week due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular daily service was restored on May 31, 2021, with funding from the American Rescue Plan.

On November 10, 2024, the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; and were merged into a Chicago–Washington–Miami service, the . The &quot;Floridian&quot; service is intended to be temporary to accommodate equipment shortages and planned rehabilitation work in the East River Tunnels.

=== Through cars ===
Between 1984 and 1986 and again from 1991 to 1993, the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; exchanged a Chicago-Miami coach with the New York-Miami &quot;Silver Star&quot; at Washington, D.C.

During 1997 and part of 1998, Amtrak operated the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; in conjunction with the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;, a daily Los Angeles–Chicago service. The two trains used the same Superliner equipment sets, and passengers traveling on both trains could remain aboard during the layover in Chicago. Originally announced in 1996, Amtrak planned to call this through service the &quot;National Chief&quot; with its own numbers (15/16), although the name and numbers were never used. Amtrak dropped the practice with the May 1998 timetable.

This route was mentioned amongst five others in the July 2010 issue of &quot;Trains&quot; magazine as slated for performance improvement, and as part of its federally mandated analysis of the worst-performing long-distance routes, Amtrak determined that reinstating a through-car connection with the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; would result in the highest gain in monetary and customer service measurements of possible options. To implement this, Amtrak had plans to operate a Viewliner sleeping car, an Amfleet cafe car and two Amfleet coaches between Chicago and New York via the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvanian,&quot; beginning sometime in 2011. &quot;Trains&quot; magazine picked up on this in their January 2011 issue, citing that a switch would be re-installed to give the thru-cars access to parallel track. Issues cited with providing such a service included a consist switch in Pittsburgh (shuffling sleeper and coach positions so that the transition sleeper was in the rear), an eight-hour layover on Sundays due to the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot;&#x27;s 1:20p departure (since eliminated), and a lack of Viewliner sleepers (delivery of new Viewliner II sleepers was delayed by several years).

== Former stops ==

The &quot;Capitol Limited&quot;&#x27;s original routing west of Pittsburgh included Ohio stops in Canton, Crestline, and Lima; and Indiana stops in Fort Wayne, Valparaiso, and Gary. Amtrak dropped Gary as a station stop on April 28, 1985. On April 27, 1986, Amtrak added Warsaw, Indiana, located between Valparaiso and Fort Wayne. All these cities lost service when Amtrak re-routed the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; north through Toledo on November 11, 1990. For a year, a dedicated bus connection was offered between Fort Wayne and Waterloo, Indiana.

Between March 2, 1982, and April 7, 1991, the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; stopped in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, located in the Monongahela Valley southeast of Pittsburgh. At the time the Port Authority of Allegheny County operated the &quot;PATrain&quot; commuter rail between McKeesport and downtown Pittsburgh. The Port Authority ended the service in 1989, citing low ridership. Amtrak followed suit a year later, noting that on average one passenger boarded at McKeesport per trip during the train&#x27;s final months of service at that station. Station platform track was subsequently removed, and the facility became an all-bus terminal.

==Route details==
Between Washington and Pittsburgh, the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; mostly followed the historic B&amp;O route along narrow river valleys hemmed in by steep slopes, mainly the Potomac River from Washington to Cumberland, then Wills Creek to just before Meyersdale, and then the Youghiogheny River most of the way to Pittsburgh. Rail trails parallel much of this route, often on the opposite banks. The route straightens and levels out from Ohio onward.

Westbound trains left Washington before the afternoon rush and arrived in Chicago in the morning, while eastbound trains left Chicago in early evening and arrived in Washington in early afternoon.

The &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; operated over the following Amtrak, CSX Transportation, and Norfolk Southern Railway trackage:
*Amtrak Washington Union Station, part of the Northeast Corridor
*CSX Metropolitan Subdivision, Cumberland Subdivision, Cumberland Terminal Subdivision, Keystone Subdivision, Pittsburgh Subdivision, and P&amp;W Subdivision, Washington to Pittsburgh
*NS Pittsburgh Line and Fort Wayne Line, Pittsburgh to Alliance
*NS Cleveland Line, Alliance to Cleveland
*NS Chicago Line, Cleveland to Chicago
*Amtrak Chicago Union Station

=== Stations ===
== Equipment ==

The Capitol Limited used bilevel Superliner equipment. Pre-COVID, a typical &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; had 2 GE P40DC/P42DC locomotives, a Viewliner II baggage car, a Superliner transition sleeper, 2 Superliner sleepers, a Superliner dining car or diner-lounge, a Superliner Sightseer Lounge, and 3 Superliner coaches. The transition sleeper, Sightseer Lounge, and one coach were removed during pandemic cutbacks. One sleeper and a second coach were removed in early 2023 due to Superliner shortages resulting from the introduction of the and the Canadian National Railway requiring the to operate with Superliners. Amtrak began replacing the older P40DC and P42DC locomotives with Siemens ALC-42 locomotives in 2023.

<doc id="325115" wikidata="Q2911990" url="?curid=325115" title="Little Green Footballs">
<text>Little Green Footballs (LGF) is an American political blog run by web designer Charles Foster Johnson. In its beginning years, the site had a right-wing orientation and was known for its advocacy of the War on Terrorism and the Iraq War, as well its strident criticism of political Islam. The blog moved away from the right around 2009 and has become focused mainly on posts about music of Johnson&#x27;s liking.

==Overview==
The site originally had a &quot;right wing&quot; orientation. It was one of the most well-known and vehement pro-War on Terrorism websites in the early days of the blogosphere. Johnson stated in 2006: 
After eight years of being a leading right wing blog, LGF started condemning racism and the far-right (especially the Belgian party Vlaams Belang). After that, the site abruptly switched sides and now &quot;LGF has become better known for the various fights it picks with many on the right.&quot; During the transition period, Johnson deleted many of his more extreme past entries on the site, deleted entire comment sections, and banned many of the former right wing commentators from the site.

More recently, in 2009, Johnson stated

On November 30, 2009, Johnson blogged that he was disassociating himself with &quot;the right,&quot; writing: &quot;The American right wing has gone off the rails, into the bushes, and off the cliff. I won&#x27;t be going over the cliff with them.&quot; He has been heavily critical of conservatives and libertarians since then.

Earlier, after the September 11, 2001 attacks, Johnson—who has described himself as &quot;pretty much center-left before 9/11&quot;—transformed his blog into a discussion of Islamist extremism and violence.

LGF won the &quot;Best Israel Advocacy Blog&quot; award from the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; in 2005. In 2004 Gil Ronen, a reporter for Internet news outlet &quot;Arutz Sheva&quot;, stated that &quot;If anyone ever compiles a list of Internet sites that contribute to Israel&#x27;s public relations effort, Johnson&#x27;s site will probably come in first, far above the Israeli Foreign Ministry&#x27;s site.&quot;

In the United States, LGF is perhaps best known for playing a key role in exposing the fraud of the Killian documents regarding President George W. Bush, which preceded the resignation of CBS&#x27;s Dan Rather. The site won the &quot;Washington Post&quot;″s reader poll for Best International Blog in November 2004 and played a role in bringing attention to altered photographs in the Adnan Hajj photographs controversy. In July 2008, LGF identified that photographs of Iran&#x27;s missile test had been altered, and was credited by much of the media for this.

===Name===
The name &quot;Little Green Footballs&quot; has not been explained by Charles Johnson. The most he has said about it is: I am at liberty to reveal that it has something to do with an incident in my youth that happened in Japan.

===Alteration and deletion of posts===
In early September, 2010, it was discovered that Johnson had begun altering some posts and deleting others which expressed sentiments which were substantively similar to the ones he had recently been condemning others for. In one example, Johnson had been condemning opponents of the Park51 project as &quot;bigots&quot;, though he had expressed similar opposition to the proposed Flight 93 memorial, which he described as an &quot;Islamic Shrine&quot;. Johnson was discovered to have deleted these posts without acknowledging their deletion. Johnson had also described the lead figure in the Park51 project, Feisal Abdul Rauf, as an &quot;Islamic Supremacist,&quot; but later revised that description from the post without acknowledging the change.

===Software===
The software for the website was written by Johnson himself in PHP. Until Spring 2007, all data was stored in flat files. The website now uses MySQL.

==Notable events==

===Killian documents===
 LGF was one of four sources, along with the Power Line and Allahpundit blogs and the Free Republic discussion forum, who conducted the initial investigation of Dan Rather&#x27;s assertions on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that the Killian documents were genuine.

===Charitable contributions===
Little Green Footballs supporters have helped raise thousands of dollars for Spirit of America&#x27;s &quot;Friends of Iraq Blogger Challenge&quot;. Supporters also donate pizzas for IDF soldiers. In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina several registered users also offered their direct services donating and transporting goods to the hardest hit, inviting contributions from other readers. Johnson also posted a number of links to charitable efforts and thanked his readers for their response.

===Pajamas Media===

In late 2005 Johnson, along with blogger and author Roger L. Simon launched a news site called Pajamas Media (briefly called &quot;Open Source Media&quot;) featuring mostly conservative and libertarian bloggers and journalists (e.g., Michelle Malkin, Glenn Reynolds, Michael Barone, Tammy Bruce, John Podhoretz, Michael Ledeen, Cathy Seipp) with some liberal participants (e.g., David Corn, Marc Cooper). The name refers to Jonathan Klein&#x27;s comment about bloggers working in their pajamas.

As of 15 September 2009, Johnson has removed all links to Pajamas Media sites from Little Green Footballs.

===Doctored photographs===

On August 5, 2006, LGF showed how a photograph of Beirut after an Israeli air strike taken by Reuters photographer Adnan Hajj was manipulated before being published by Reuters.
On July 10, 2008 the website documented alterations to photos of Iranian missile tests. Fox News credited the website for discovering the doctored photos.

===Awards===
Little Green Footballs once had two annual awards; The Fiskie and The Fallaci. The Fiskie was named after journalist Robert Fisk, in a blog post where Johnson notes that, after having been captured and beaten by Afghan refugees, Fisk claimed he sympathized with them. The award was given to people who in the previous year best embodied the &quot;Idiotarian&quot; worldview. The Fallaci was named after the late Oriana Fallaci, and given to people who in the previous year best embodied the &quot;Anti-Idiotarian&quot; worldview.

Johnson had previously allowed his users to nominate and vote on candidates for both awards. The Fallaci was discontinued without explanation after 2007. Johnson quietly removed a link to her memorial site from the blog during his ideological shift in 2008. The Fiskie was discontinued after 2009. That year, rather than allow the community to vote, Johnson unilaterally awarded the Fiskie to Glenn Beck.

==Recurring themes==

===Pre-2009===

====Slang====
Discussing slang terms used by Johnson and his readers, Paul Farhi, a writer for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, notes:

====Monitoring and exposing rival websites for revisionist editing====
Charles Johnson&#x27;s posts on LGF frequently call attention to what he regards as unethical revisionism on the part of rival blogs.

====Ideological influences====
Charles Johnson&#x27;s posts on LGF frequently cited the writing of authors representing Neoconservative viewpoints, such as Victor Davis Hanson, Charles Krauthammer, Mark Steyn, James Lileks, and Oriana Fallaci. Johnson has expressed a strong disdain for the Tea Party protests. Since his strong break with the right, he has come to openly criticize many of those same writers. He frequently references climate blogger Peter Sinclair in posts about global warming.

====Palestinian child abuse====
Johnson often posts photos taken by Associated Press and Reuters photographers, among others, of Palestinians dressing their children in paramilitary uniforms, or in clothing emblazoned with violent slogans such as &quot;Death to Israel.&quot; These children are often shown carrying real guns and even wearing mock-ups of the explosive belts used by suicide bombers. Johnson refers to such photographs as evidence of Palestinian child abuse.

====Rachel Corrie====
Johnson has stated many times that he is disgusted with media coverage of the death of International Solidarity Movement activist Rachel Corrie, who was killed by an Israeli bulldozer in Rafah, a town in the Gaza Strip. Johnson disputes the ISM&#x27;s account, holding that Corrie, who was regularly mocked as &quot;Saint Pancake&quot; on his website, was &quot;trying to &#x27;protect&#x27; a house used for drugs and weapons smuggling&quot;. Johnson states:

In support of this view, he has cited a diary entry from Corrie, which Johnson characterizes as expressing the view that Palestinian violence towards Israel is justifiable and laudable.

In posts about her on LGF, Johnson often features a photo of Corrie burning a hand-drawn American flag and surrounded by Palestinian children.

====Intelligent Design criticism====
LGF has been empirically opposed to Intelligent Design, and Johnson regularly posts to criticize the subject and those who endorse it. He is particularly critical of Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal on this point. In 2009, he stated that the Republican Party&#x27;s having visible advocates of Intelligent Design is one of the reasons that the Democrats were in power.

===Post-2009===

====Edward Snowden====
Johnson has been critical of Edward Snowden and his disclosures. In 2014, he asserted that &quot;Snowden himself committed a truly massive violation of civil liberties&quot;.

==Registration and posting protocols==

===Posting filter===
Johnson has put in place a filter which stops LGF members from using certain derogatory and racist terms in their posts to the site. Johnson stresses that the number of comments filtered in this way are &quot;minuscule.&quot; The filter is intended to prevent abuse going unnoticed.

===Rivalries===
Johnson and LGF &quot;regulars&quot; (the self-proclaimed &quot;Lizardoids&quot;) have engaged in a number of high-profile feuds and flame wars, pitting LGF supporters against readers of other blogs (e.g., Daily Kos and later Hot Air) and alternative media sites (e.g., Fark and Digg).

As of 2014, one of Charles Johnson&#x27;s main targets is an alt-right figure and well-known Internet troll with the same first and last name as him. When speaking of Charles C. Johnson, the LGF owner takes pains to point out that this doppelganger &quot;is not me.&quot;

===Redirects===
Johnson often redirects incoming links from sites critical of LGF to the Israel Defense Forces homepage.

Following a news release which CAIR sent to pay-for-play organization PRNewswire.com, Johnson redirected the news release&#x27;s link traffic to a site regarding CAIR&#x27;s alleged ties to terrorist organizations. CAIR responded by having the links removed from the press release.

==Controversies==

===Allegations of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim sentiment===
*R. J. Smith, writing in &quot;Los Angeles Magazine&quot;, stated that LGF is a &quot;dysfunctional mix of beautiful photos Johnson takes on coastal bike rides and constitutionally protected hate speech&quot; which &quot;believes all Muslims are terrorists until proven innocent.&quot;

*Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council of American Islamic Relations (CAIR) called Little Green Footballs &quot;a vicious, anti-Muslim hate site&quot; and says that the FBI has &quot;investigated several threats of physical harm against Muslims posted by Little Green Footballs readers&quot;.
*Columnist Antonia Zerbisias has described LGF as a &quot;virulently anti-Muslim/Arab website&quot;.

===Google and Websense===
*In March 2005, Johnson called attention to Google&#x27;s inclusion of the white supremacist National Vanguard site (and simultaneous exclusion of LGF) in its news index; the NV site has since been dropped.
*In April 2007 Johnson reported that Little Green Footballs was being blocked by Websense under its &quot;Racism and Hate&quot; category. Websense admitted that the site had been thus categorized briefly (but incorrectly) and subsequently reversed the decision.

===Statements about Ron Paul===
*Johnson removed Ron Paul&#x27;s name from straw polls regarding the 2008 Republican Presidential nomination campaign, asserting that Ron Paul&#x27;s supporters were fraudulently gaming the vote script to increase Paul&#x27;s numbers: &quot;The bottom line: if Ron Paul supporters weren’t spamming, he would still be in our polls. I really don’t have any nefarious motives here; I just don’t like being gamed, and since I run these silly unscientific polls I don’t have to put up with it.&quot; According to Johnson, the tactic used was an organized campaign by Ron Paul supporters to notify other supporters of online polls and vote in them.
*In December 2007, libertarian writer David Weigel accused Johnson of launching a &quot;smear&quot; against Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, writing in &quot;Reason&quot; magazine that:

Johnson&#x27;s allegations were picked up in the &quot;New York Times&quot; &quot;Medium&quot; section, where Virginia Heffernan cited LGF&#x27;s coverage of claims by Bill White, writing:

===Statements about Vlaams Belang===
In the wake of the Brussels Counterjihad 2007 conference held on October 17–18, 2007, Charles Johnson became openly critical of the Vlaams Belang and Sweden Democrats, political parties he believes to be fascist or neo-Nazi in character.

==Media attention in the United States==

=== 2002 ===
*MSNBC&#x27;s Will Femia wrote of LGF:
*Syndicated columnist James Taranto defended LGF after MSNBC &#x27;smeared&#x27; Johnson.

===2005===
*&quot;Vanity Fair&quot; theater critic James Wolcott characterized the LGF community as &quot;sort of like a disorganized Nuremberg Rally, a lot of angry ruffians with nowhere to go...&quot; after Johnson described an attack on Daniel Pipes by Wolcott as &quot;the sort of high-toned writin’ that made Vanity Fair the journalistic juggernaut it is today&quot;.
*&quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; described LGF as one of &quot;the saner precincts of the blogosphere&quot;.

===2006===
*Pajamas Media contributor Cathy Seipp wrote in &quot;National Review&quot; that:
===2009===
*Charles Johnson and LGF received attention from the leftist blog the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; because of a blog post of Johnsons disassociating himself from &quot;the right&quot; because of perceived, &quot;anti-Islamic bigotry that goes far beyond simply criticizing radical Islam, into support for fascism, violence, and genocide,&quot; embracing of conspiracy theories, and hate speech.

===2010===
*Author and journalist Jonathan Dee wrote a lengthy profile of Johnson for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. Johnson later criticized the article for its negative slant and for lending too much weight to the opinions of people whom, Johnson wrote, the &quot;Times&quot; would &quot;normally assign to the &#x27;wacko far right bigot&#x27; category&quot;.

<doc id="325119" wikidata="Q313745" url="?curid=325119" title="Tokugawa Tsunayoshi">
<text>was the fifth &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa dynasty of Japan. He was the younger brother of Tokugawa Ietsuna, as well as the son of Tokugawa Iemitsu, the grandson of Tokugawa Hidetada, and the great-grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu.

Tsunayoshi is known for instituting animal welfare laws, particularly for dogs. This earned him the nickname of &quot;the dog &quot;Shogun&quot;&quot; (&quot;Inu-Kubō&quot; 犬公方: &quot;Inu=&quot;Dog, &quot;Kubō&quot;=formal title of Shogun).

==Early years (1646–1680)==

Tokugawa Tsunayoshi was born on 23 February 1646, in Edo. He was the son of Tokugawa Iemitsu by one of his concubines, named Otama, later known as Keishōin 桂昌院 (1627–1705). Tsunayoshi had an elder brother already five years old, who would become the next shogun after Iemitsu&#x27;s death, Tokugawa Ietsuna. Tsunayoshi was born in Edo and after his birth moved in with his mother to her own private apartments in Edo Castle. &quot;The younger son (Tsunayoshi) apparently distinguished himself by his precociousness and liveliness at an early age, and the father, the third shogun, Iemitsu, became fearful that he might usurp the position of his duller elder brothers [and] thus he ordered that the boy (Tsunayoshi) not to be brought up as a samurai/warrior, as was becoming for his station, but be trained as a scholar.&quot; His childhood name was Tokumatsu ().

While his father was &quot;shōgun&quot;, his mother was an adopted daughter of the Honjō family, led by Honjō Munemasa (1580–1639) in Kyoto. His mother&#x27;s natural parents were merchants in Kyoto. This remarkable woman was very close with Tsunayoshi in his young years, and while his older brother Ietsuna began to rely on regents for much of his reign, Tsunayoshi did exactly the opposite, relying on his remarkable mother for advice until her death.

In 1651, &quot;shōgun&quot; Iemitsu died when Tsunayoshi was only five years old. His older brother, Tokugawa Ietsuna, became shogun. For the most part, Tsunayoshi&#x27;s life during the reign of his brother &quot;shōgun&quot; Ietsuna is unknown, but he never advised his brother.

==Disputed succession (1680)==
In 1680, &quot;shōgun&quot; Ietsuna died at the premature age of 38.

* 4 June 1680 (&quot;Enpō 8, 8th day of the 5th month&quot;): Shogun Ietsuna&#x27;s death leads to the accession of Tsunayoshi as head of the shogunate.
* 1680–81 (&quot;Enpō 8&quot;): Gokoku-ji in Edo is founded in honor of Tsunayoshi&#x27;s mother.
* 1681 (&quot;Tenna 1&quot;): Tsunayoshi&#x27;s investiture as &quot;shōgun&quot;.

A power struggle ensued, and for a time, the succession remained an open question. Sakai Tadakiyo, one of Ietsuna&#x27;s most favored advisors, suggested that the succession not pass to someone of the Tokugawa line, but rather to the blood royal, favoring one of the sons of Emperor Go-Sai to become the next &quot;shōgun&quot; (as during the Kamakura shogunate) but Tadakiyo was dismissed soon after.

Hotta Masatoshi, one of the most brilliant advisors of &quot;shōgun&quot; Ietsuna&#x27;s rule, was the first person to suggest that Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, as the brother of the former &quot;shōgun&quot; and the son of the third, become the next &quot;shōgun&quot;. Finally, in 1681 (&quot;Tenna 1&quot;), Tsunayoshi&#x27;s elevation was confirmed; and he was installed as the fifth &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa shogunate.

==&quot;Shōgun&quot; (1680–1709)==

Immediately after becoming &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tsunayoshi gave Hotta Masatoshi the title of &quot;Tairō&quot;, in a way thanking him for ensuring his succession. Almost immediately after he became shogun, he ordered a vassal of the Takata to commit suicide because of misgovernment, showing his strict approach to the samurai code. He then confiscated his fief of 250,000 &quot;koku&quot;. During his reign, he confiscated a total of 1,400,000 &quot;koku&quot;.

In 1682, &quot;shōgun&quot; Tsunayoshi ordered his censors and police to raise the living standard of the people. Soon, prostitution was banned, waitresses could not be employed in tea houses, and rare and expensive fabrics were banned. Most probably, smuggling began as a practice in Japan soon after Tsunayoshi&#x27;s authoritarian laws came into effect. In 1684, Tsunayoshi also decreased the power of the &quot;tairō&quot; after the assassination of Masatoshi by a cousin in that same year.

Nonetheless, due again to maternal advice, Tsunayoshi became very religious, promoting the Neo-Confucianism of Zhu Xi. In 1682, he read to the &quot;daimyōs&quot; an exposition of the &quot;Great Learning&quot;, which became an annual tradition at the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s court. He soon began to lecture even more, and in 1690 lectured about Neo-Confucian work to Shinto and Buddhist &quot;daimyōs&quot;, and even to envoys from the court of Emperor Higashiyama in Kyoto. He also was interested in several Chinese works, namely &quot;The Great Learning&quot; (Da Xue) and &quot;The Classic of Filial Piety&quot; (Xiao Jing). Tsunayoshi also loved art and Noh theater.

In 1691, Engelbert Kaempfer visited Edo as part of the annual Dutch embassy from Dejima in Nagasaki. He journeyed from Nagasaki to Osaka, to Kyoto, and there to Edo. Kaempfer gives us information on Japan during the early reign of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi. As the Dutch embassy entered Edo in 1692, they asked to have an audience with Shogun Tsunayoshi. While they were waiting for approval, a fire destroyed six hundred houses in Edo, and the audience was postponed. Tsunayoshi and several of the ladies of the court sat behind reed screens, while the Dutch embassy sat in front of them. Tsunayoshi took an interest in Western matters, and apparently asked them to talk and sing with one another for him to see how Westerners behaved. Tsunayoshi later put on a Noh drama for them.

Owing to religious fundamentalism, Tsunayoshi sought protection for living beings in the later parts of his rule. In the 1690s and first decade of the 1700s, Tsunayoshi, who was born in the Year of the Dog, thought he should take several measures concerning dogs. A collection of edicts released daily, known as the , told the populace, among other things, to protect dogs, since in Edo there were many stray and diseased dogs walking around the city. Therefore, he earned the pejorative title &quot;Inu-Kubō&quot; (犬公方: &quot;Inu=&quot;Dog, &quot;Kubō&quot;=formal title of Shogun).

In 1695, there were so many dogs that Edo began to smell horribly. An apprentice was even executed because he wounded a dog. Finally, the issue was taken to an extreme, as over 50,000 dogs were deported to kennels in the suburbs of the city where they would be housed. They were apparently fed rice and fish at the expense of the taxpaying citizens of Edo.

For the latter part of Tsunayoshi&#x27;s reign, he was advised by Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu. It was a golden era of classic Japanese art, known as the &quot;Genroku era&quot;.

In 1701, Asano Naganori, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Akō han, having been allegedly insulted by Kira Yoshinaka in Edo Castle, attempted to kill him. Asano was executed, but Kira went unpunished. Asano&#x27;s forty-seven &quot;rōnin&quot; avenged his death by killing Kira and became a legend that influenced many plays and stories of the era. The most successful of them was a bunraku play called &quot;Kanadehon Chūshingura&quot; (now simply called &quot;Chūshingura&quot;, or &quot;Treasury of Loyal Retainers&quot;), written in 1748 by Takeda Izumo and two associates; it was later adapted into a kabuki play, which is still one of Japan&#x27;s most popular. The earliest known account of the Akō incident in the West was published in 1822 in Isaac Titsingh&#x27;s book, &quot;Illustrations of Japan&quot;.

Tsunayoshi&#x27;s first son Tokugawa Tokumatsu (1679–1683) died at the age of 4 due to illness. 

In 1704, Tsunayoshi&#x27;s only surviving child, Tsuruhime died following a miscarriage and a few months after her husband, his son-in-law, Tokugawa Tsunanori of Kii Domain also died. Therefore, Tsunayoshi appointed his nephew, Tokugawa Ienobu, heir apparent in the winter of 1704. Ienobu was the son of his other brother, Tokugawa Tsunashige, the former Lord of Kōfu, which was a title Ienobu held himself before becoming &quot;shōgun&quot;. Ienobu moved into the official residence of Shogunal heir apparent at the Western Perimeter of Edo Castle.

In 1706, Edo was hit by a typhoon, and Mount Fuji erupted the following year.

==Death==
It was insinuated that Tsunayoshi was stabbed by his consort after he tried to proclaim an illegitimate child as his heir; this concept, stemming from the Sanno Gaiki, is refuted in contemporary records which explain that Tsunayoshi had the measles at the end of his life and died on 19 February 1709, in the presence of his entourage. His death was just four days short of his 63rd birthday. He was given the Buddhist name Joken&#x27;in () and buried in Kan&#x27;ei-ji.

==Eras of Tsunayoshi&#x27;s &quot;bakufu&quot;==
The years in which Tsunayoshi was shogun are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Enpō&quot; (1673–1681)
* &quot;Tenna&quot; (1681–1684)
* &quot;Jōkyō&quot; (1684–1688)
* &quot;Genroku&quot; (1688–1704)
* &quot;Hōei&quot; (1704–1711)

<doc id="325130" wikidata="Q1801411" url="?curid=325130" title="Paus family">
<text>The Paus family () is a prominent Norwegian family with a long history of involvement in the clergy and governance elite, nobility, industry, and the arts. The family first emerged as members of the elite of 16th-century Oslo and, for centuries, belonged to Norway&#x27;s &quot;aristocracy of officials,&quot; especially in the clergy and legal professions in Upper Telemark. Later generations became involved in shipping, steel, and banking, establishing themselves as steel magnates in Christiania (Oslo) during the Second Industrial Revolution. The family&#x27;s most famous members are playwright Henrik Ibsen and singer Ole Paus.

Two brothers from Oslo who both became priests, Hans (1587–1648) and Peder Povelsson Paus (1590–1653), have long been known as the family&#x27;s earliest certain ancestors. In his book &quot;Slekten Paus&quot;, S.H. Finne-Grønn traced the family two further generations back, to Hans Olufsson (died 1570), a high-ranking member of the royal clergy who held the rank of a knight, the highest rank of nobility in Norway at the time. The name Paus, believed to be of Middle Saxon or Middle Dutch origin, is known in Oslo since the 14th century, notably as the name of the Lawspeaker of Oslo Nikolas Paus (mentioned 1329–1347) and as the name of one of medieval Oslo&#x27;s &quot;city farms&quot;, &quot;Pausinn&quot; (mentioned 1324–1482). The extant family is descended from Peder Povelsson Paus, who was provost of Upper Telemark from 1633. From the 17th to the 19th century, the family were among the foremost of the regional elite, the &quot;aristocracy of officials&quot; in Upper Telemark, where many family members served as priests of the state church, judges and other government officials and where several state and church offices in practice were hereditary in the family for extended periods. For example, the office of governor/chief district judge (&quot;sorenskriver&quot;) of Upper Telemark—the region&#x27;s senior government official—was continuously held by the family for 106 years (1668–1774) and passed on in an hereditary manner.

From the late 18th century family members successively established themselves as ship&#x27;s captains, shipowners, wealthy merchants and bankers in the port towns of Skien and Drammen. From the 19th century several family members were prominent as steel industrialists in Christiania; other family members founded the industrial company Paus &amp; Paus in Drammen and Oslo. Family members have also owned or co-owned several other major companies, including Norway&#x27;s largest shipping company Wilh. Wilhelmsen. Since the early 20th century family members have owned half a dozen estates and castles in Sweden, of which the estates Herresta and Näsbyholm in Södermanland are still owned by the family; the Herresta/Näsbyholm branch is descended from Tatiana Tolstoy-Paus, Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s last surviving grandchild. Christopher Paus, a papal chamberlain and heir to one of Norway&#x27;s largest timber companies who donated the Paus collection of classical sculpture to the National Gallery, was conferred the title of count by Pope Pius XI in 1923. A village in India, Pauspur, was named in honour of the family in the 19th century. Family members living in Italy and Austria-Hungary from the 19th century spelled the name &quot;de Paus&quot; or &quot;von Paus&quot;.

The family&#x27;s best known descendant is the playwright Henrik Ibsen. Both of his parents belonged to the family in either a biological or social sense. Through the Paus family, their closest relatives, Ibsen&#x27;s parents had been raised as &quot;near-siblings.&quot; Ibsen named or modelled various characters after family members. Episodes and motifs in several of Ibsen&#x27;s dramas—notably &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, &quot;Ghosts&quot;, &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;, &quot;The Wild Duck&quot;, &quot;Rosmersholm&quot;, and &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;—were inspired by Paus family traditions and real events that took place in the closely intertwined households of the siblings Ole Paus and Hedevig Paus in the early 19th century. The Paus family figures in Ibsen studies, and Jon Nygaard has argued that the emergence of &quot;the new Puritan state of the officials&quot; with the spirit of &quot;Upper Telemark, the Paus family&quot; is a major theme in Ibsen&#x27;s work. Modern family members include the troubadour Ole Paus and his son, the composer Marcus Paus. Family members live in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the U.K. and Switzerland. In the course of its history, family members have used multiple seals and coats of arms, including a crane in its vigilance in the seal of Povel Paus on the 1661 Sovereignty Act and a bull&#x27;s head with golden star used since the 19th century.

==The name Paus in Oslo in the 14th and 15th centuries==
The name Paus is known in Oslo in the 14th and 15th centuries and was used by individuals who belonged to the same small elite social class as the family that is documented from the 16th century. The farm &quot;Pausinn&quot; (&quot;The Paus&quot;) was one of the &quot;city farms&quot; that were part of medieval Oslo and is mentioned between 1324 and 1482, when it was owned by individuals who belonged to the city&#x27;s elite. Paus is also used as the cognomen of several individuals in 14th and 15th century Oslo or its surroundings who appear to be related and who owned substantial property in nearby Nes. The most notable individual named Paus in medieval Oslo was Nikolas Sigurdsson Paus, who is mentioned as the Lawspeaker of Oslo in 1347, shortly before the Black Death reached the city. There were around a dozen lawspeakers in the entire kingdom, and they were part of the nobility. Two seals used by Nikolas Paus are included in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Noble Families in Denmark, Norway and the Duchies&quot; (published 1782–1813). Medieval historians P.A. Munch, Alexander Bugge and Edvard Bull argued that &quot;Pausinn&quot; was probably named after Nikolas Paus or a member of his family; on the basis of the Middle Saxon/Middle Dutch-sounding name, they argued that the family was of Low German/Dutch origin, and wrote that the Paus family was an influential immigrant family in medieval Oslo; the family may have immigrated as merchants in the 12th or 13th century from northern Germany or the Netherlands.

Genealogist S.H. Finne-Grønn presumed that the younger family&#x27;s name was derived from the name of Nikolas Paus and his family and from the city farm of &quot;Pausinn&quot; in one way or the other; only a century separates the last mention of Pausinn and the birth of the modern family&#x27;s earliest certain ancestors who were known by the name. Oslo had a very small population in the time period, probably less than a thousand inhabitants in the years following the Black Death, and an even smaller elite, that family names were exceedingly rare in Norway both in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries and typically only used by nobles/clerics and merchants of an immigrant background, and that the name Paus is atypical of Norwegian. Genealogist C. S. Schilbred noted that &quot;the connection between the older and the younger family of the name has not been established, but on the other hand no convincing arguments against such a possibility have been made.&quot; It is however a possibility that the family acquired the name indirectly, e.g. from &quot;Pausinn&quot;, rather than by direct descent. The modern family, believing itself to be related to the 14th century family, adopted an interpretation (itself dating to the 18th century) of Nikolas Paus&#x27; 1330 seal as its coat of arms in the late 19th century.

==The family in the 16th century==
According to genealogist S.H. Finne-Grønn, the family is most likely descended from Hans Olufsson (died 1570), a canon at St Mary&#x27;s Church, the royal chapel in Oslo. As indicated by his patronymic, Hans Olufsson&#x27;s father was named Oluf. Due to his career as a member of the royal clergy, Hans Olufsson almost certainly had a privileged family background. Most canons in Norway at the time were recruited from the lower nobility, and normally studied at universities abroad, which was normally only possible with an affluent background. Hans Olufsson served as a canon at St Mary&#x27;s Church and a member of its cathedral chapter until it was merged with that of Oslo Cathedral in 1545, following the Reformation. St Mary&#x27;s Church was a powerful political institution as the seat of government of Norway at the time, as its provost was also the Chancellor of Norway with one of the canons serving as Vice-Chancellor. Its clergy held high aristocratic rank &quot;ex officio&quot;, as decreed by Haakon V of Norway in a 1300 royal proclamation, with canons holding the rank of Knight (the highest rank of nobility in Norway since 1308), and were granted significant privileges. Hans Olufsson held a prebend (estate held for his lifetime), the prebend of Saint Mary&#x27;s altar , also known as the prebend of Dillevik, that included the income of 43 church properties (36 &quot;huder&quot;, hides) in Eastern Norway. After 1545, Hans Olufsson served as a priest at Oslo Cathedral, but retained his prebend affiliated with the estate of St Mary&#x27;s Church. He died on the night between 17 and 18 September 1570 and was buried in Oslo Cathedral on 19 September. Following his death, his prebend passed to Jens Nilssøn, the noted Oslo humanist and later Bishop of Oslo.

Hans Olufsson&#x27;s son, as documented by court proceedings from 1602, was &quot;Povel Hansson&quot; (probably born &quot;ca.&quot; 1545–50), who was a burgher and apparently a wealthy merchant in Oslo. He was according to Finne-Grønn most likely the father of the two clergymen who became the ancestors of two lineages of the family, and who have long been known as the family&#x27;s earliest certain ancestors: &quot;Hans Povelsson Paus&quot; (1587–1648) and &quot;Peder Povelsson Paus&quot; (1590–1653). Both brothers were born in Oslo in the late 16th century and clearly belonged to its social elite, evidenced by their extensive and costly education, their subsequent careers and their apparent social connections to prominent men of the church and nobility in Oslo in the early 17th century.

==Hans and Peder Povelsson Paus and their descendants==

&quot;Hans Povelsson Paus&quot; (1587–1648) was born in Oslo and entered the University of Copenhagen as a student under the name &quot;Johannes Paulli Asloensis&quot; (Asloensis meaning Oslo) around 1607–08. He earned the bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1616, and shortly after became a chaplain at Oslo Cathedral. In 1622, he succeeded his presumed stepfather Anders Augustinusen as parish priest in Fredrikstad. He had a limited number of descendants, including his sons, Magister &quot;Povel Hansson Paus&quot; (1620–1658), parish priest in Lier, Bragernes and Strømsø, and &quot;Anders Hansson Paus&quot; (1622–1689), parish priest in Jevnaker.
Hans&#x27; younger brother &quot;Peder Povelsson Paus&quot; (1590–1653) was born in Oslo and entered the University of Copenhagen as a student under the name &quot;Petrus Paulli Asloensis&quot;. Following his studies, he served as headmaster of Skien Latin School around 1617, as parish priest in Vinje and as parish priest in Kviteseid and provost of Upper Telemark from 1633. He was married to Johanne Madsdatter. The tradition of Peder&#x27;s great physical powers have been handed down in Kviteseid until the modern age. Peder was buried under the choir floor in Kviteseid Old Church, where his son Povel placed a beautiful poem in Latin in memory of his father.
Peder&#x27;s son &quot;Povel Pedersson Paus&quot; (1625–1682) was parish priest in Hjartdal and married to &quot;Ingrid Corneliusdatter Trinepol&quot; (1632–1694), a daughter of timber merchant Cornelius Jansen Trinepol (1611–1678) and a member of the wealthy patriciate of Skien who was notably descended from Jørgen von Ansbach. Povel Pedersson Paus was among the 87 representatives of the Norwegian clerical estate who signed the 1661 Sovereignty Act, Denmark-Norway&#x27;s new constitution which introduced absolute and hereditary monarchy. Magnus Brostrup Landstad describes Povel Pedersson Paus as a learned and pious priest who held on to Catholic customs in post-Reformation Norway. Well versed in Latin, he wrote a Latin poem about his father and personally educated his children. Among his ten children were parish priest in Kviteseid &quot;Hans Paus&quot; (1656–1715) and district judge in Upper Telemark &quot;Cornelius Paus&quot; (1662–1723), from which two living main lines of the family are descended. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the office of district judge of Upper Telemark was effectively hereditary in the family for 106 consecutive years and four generations.

==Skien branch==

The &quot;Skien branch&quot; of the family is descended from district judge of Upper Telemark &quot;Cornelius Paus&quot; (1662–1723). He married Valborg Ravn (1673–1726), the daughter of his predecessor as district judge Jørgen Hansen Ravn and Margrethe Fredriksdatter Blom (born 1650). His father-in-law was appointed district judge in 1668 and stepped down in favour of his son-in-law in 1696.

Their son, the procurator (i.e. advocate) &quot;Paul Paus&quot; (1697–1768) served as his father&#x27;s deputy judge and as acting district judge for some time, and married Martha Blom (1699–1755), a daughter of forest owner Christopher Blom (1651–1735) and Johanne Margrethe Ørn (1671–1745).
They were the parents of &quot;Johanne Paus&quot; (1723–1807), married to provost of Raabyggelaget Johan Christopher von Koss (1725–1778), forest inspector of Upper Telemark &quot;Cornelius Paus&quot; (1726–1799), and &quot;Cathrine (Medea Maj) Paus&quot; (1741–1776), married to Counselor of Justice Anthon Jacob de Coucheron (1732–1802).

Cornelius Paus sold the former district judge&#x27;s farm Haatvet in Lårdal in 1788 and moved to Skien, where he died in the home of his son-in-law Johan Andreas Altenburg in 1799. He was married to Christine Falck and was the father of Ole, Martha and Hedevig Paus, who all settled in Skien.

&quot;Martha Paus&quot; (1761–1786) married ship-owner and timber merchant Hans Jensen Blom (1757–1808), and her descendants include supreme court justice Knut Blom.

&quot;Hedevig Christine Paus&quot; (1763–1848) married ship-owner and merchant Johan Andreas Altenburg, and they were the maternal grandparents of playwright Henrik Ibsen. Among their descendants are also Prime Minister Sigurd Ibsen, film director Tancred Ibsen and the actress Beate Bille.

&quot;Ole Paus&quot; (1776–1855) became a burgher of Skien in 1798, and has numerous descendants. He married Johanne Plesner, daughter of the wealthy merchant Knud Plesner and Maria Kall, and who had formerly been married to ship&#x27;s captain Henrich Ibsen (Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s grandfather). Ole Paus and Johanne Plesner were the parents of the lawyer &quot;Henrik Johan Paus&quot; (1799–1893), of the judge, magistrate, Member of Parliament and Governor of Bratsberg Christian Cornelius Paus (1800–1879), and of the merchant and ship-owner Christopher Blom Paus (1810–1898). Ole Paus also became the stepfather of Knud Ibsen. As Henrik Ibsen pointed out in an 1882 letter to Georg Brandes, the Paus family was one of the patrician families dominating the port town of Skien, where he grew up.
Henrik Johan Paus, a lawyer who owned the estate Østerhaug in Elverum for some years, married Sophie Lintrup, a daughter of county chief physician (&quot;amtsfysikus&quot;) Christian Lintrup. They were the parents of Major and War Commissioner &quot;Johan Altenborg Paus&quot; (1833–1894), who married his second cousin Agnes Tostrup, a daughter of timber merchant Christopher Tostrup. They were the parents of land owner, art collector, philanthropist, papal chamberlain and Knight of Malta &quot;Christopher Tostrup Paus&quot; (1862–1943), who inherited much of his family&#x27;s shares of the Tostrup &amp; Mathiesen company and who owned the Trystorp and Herresta estates in Sweden. A convert to Catholicism, Christopher Tostrup Paus was conferred the hereditary title of count by Pope Pius XI on 25 May 1923, and joined the Ointroducerad Adels Förening in 1924, thus becoming part of Sweden&#x27;s unintroduced nobility. He died in 1943 without issue. Among Henrik Johan Paus&#x27; descendants are also the British diplomat &quot;Christopher Lintrup Paus&quot; (b. 1881), the Director at the Directorate of Public Roads &quot;Hans Wangensten Paus&quot; (b. 1891) and Ambassador in Iran, Brazil and Mexico &quot;Thorleif Lintrup Paus&quot; (b. 1912).

Christopher Blom Paus was the father of iron and steel wholesaler, factory-owner and banker &quot;Ole Paus&quot; (1846–1931) and engineer &quot;Carl Ludvig Paus&quot; (1856–1953).

Ole Paus was married to Birgitte Halvordine Schou (a cousin of Halvor Schou), and their children were &quot;Martha Marie Paus&quot; (b. 1876), married to historian Otto von Munthe af Morgenstierne, businessman &quot;Christopher Blom Paus&quot; (1878–1959), Consul-General, businessman and estate owner &quot;Thorleif Paus&quot; (1881–1976), &quot;Else Margrethe Paus&quot; (b. 1885), married to businessman Nicolay Nissen Paus (her distant relative), and &quot;Fanny Paus&quot; (1888–1971), married to businessman Trygve Andvord (1888–1958).

Christopher Blom Paus (b. 1878) was the father of businessman Per Christian Cornelius Paus, married to his distant cousin Hedevig, Countess of Wedel-Jarlsberg, who owned the Esviken manor, and &quot;Else Birgitte Paus&quot;, married to Danish lawyer and papal chamberlain Gunnar Garth-Grüner (1903–93). Per and Hedevig were the parents of &quot;Cornelia Paus&quot;, businessman &quot;Peder Nicolas Paus&quot; and businessman &quot;Christopher Paus&quot;, married to Cecilie Wilhelmsen, whose family owns the Wilh. Wilhelmsen shipping company. Their daughters are designer Pontine Paus and Olympia Paus; Pontine is the girlfriend of the chairman of Sotheby&#x27;s, Harry Primrose, Lord Dalmeny, the heir to the Earldom of Rosebery, while Olympia is married to former Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix.
Thorleif Paus served as Norwegian consul-general in Vienna, owned two factories and became owner of Kvesarum Castle in Sweden. He was married to Ella Stein and secondly to Countess Ella Moltke née Glückstadt. He was the father of Major-General Ole Otto Paus, the grandfather of troubadour Ole Paus and the great-grandfather of composer Marcus Paus. Else and Nicolay Nissen Paus were the parents of &quot;Lucie Paus&quot;, married to land-owner Axel Løvenskiold, and &quot;Fanny Paus&quot;, married to Ambassador Henrik Andreas Broch.

===Herresta branch===

Carl Ludvig Paus (b. 1856) was the father of land-owner &quot;Herman Christopher Paus&quot; (1897–1983), who bought Herresta, one of the largest estates of Södermanland County in Sweden, from his relative, Count Christopher Tostrup Paus, in 1938. He was married to Countess Tatyana Tolstoy, a granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy. Their descendants own several estates in Sweden and form the Herresta branch of the family. Today, Herresta is managed by their grandson Fredric Christopherson Paus.

Christopher Tostrup Paus owned many family portraits dating back to the 17th century, which were found at Herresta and some of which are still found there. They included a silhouette of members of the Altenburg and Paus families from shortly after the Napoleonic Wars, including Marichen Altenburg—the only existing portrait of any of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s parents.

==Drammen branch==

The Drammen branch is descended from &quot;Hans Paus&quot; (b. 1656). He was married to Susanne Morland (1670–1747), who was the daughter of provost of Upper Telemark Amund Morland (1624–1700) and the granddaughter of land-owners Christen Andersen and Anne Gundersdatter, who owned Borgestad Manor. Hans Paus wrote the poem &quot;Stolt Anne&quot; about his wife&#x27;s first cousin Anne Clausdatter, which is noted for being the first written in dialect in Norway. Their son &quot;Peder Paus&quot; (1691–1759) succeeded his uncle Cornelius as district judge of Upper Telemark in 1723, and was in turn succeeded by his son, &quot;Hans Paus&quot; (1720–1774) in 1751. Peder Paus was married in his first marriage to Danish-born Cathrine Medea May Hermansdatter Arentsen (died 1736), daughter of the parish priest in Ølsted northwest of Copenhagen Herman Arentsen and granddaughter of Arent Berntsen and Søren Nielsen May. In his second marriage, he married his cousin Hedvig Coldevin Corneliusdatter Paus. Hans Paus, a son of the first marriage, was married to Danish-born Andrea Jaspara Nissen (1725–1772), daughter of Captain Nicolai von Nissen and Christence Groll and a member of a prominent and partially ennobled Danish family of land-owners who were descended from most of the Danish &quot;Uradel&quot; including Banner-Høeg, Kaas, Grubbe, Ulfstand, Bille, Reventlow, Juel, Lykke, Gyldenstierne, Rosenkrantz, Walkendorff, Ulfeldt, Rantzau and Brahe. Numerous of their descendants are named for the Nissen family to this day.

Hans&#x27; and Andrea&#x27;s grandson was shipmaster in Drammen &quot;Isach Nicolai Nissen Pauss&quot; (1780–1849), the father of ship-owner and shipmaster &quot;Nicolai Nissen Pauss&quot; (1811–1877) and &quot;Gustava Hanna Andrea Pauss&quot; (born 1815), married to ship-owner Hartvig Eckersberg (born 1813). Nicolai Nissen Pauss was married to Caroline Louise Salvesen, a granddaughter of wealthy ship-owner and timber merchant Jacob Fegth (1761–1834), who contributed to the establishment of the University of Oslo. Their children were ship-owner &quot;Ismar Mathias Pauss&quot; (1835–1907), &quot;Nicoline Louise Pauss&quot;, married to ship-owner Peter Hannibal Høeg, and cand.theol. &quot;Bernhard Cathrinus Pauss&quot; (1839–1907), who became the owner of Nissen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, a private girls&#x27; school in Oslo which served the city&#x27;s higher bourgeoisie. He also established the first tertiary education for women in Norway, a women&#x27;s teacher&#x27;s college. The village of Pauspur in India was named in his honour. Two of Ismar Mathias Pauss&#x27; sons founded the Paus &amp; Paus industrial company, which existed 1906–2001. Another son, Olav Eduard Pauss, was a ship-owner and consul-general in Sydney.
Bernhard Cathrinus Pauss was married to Anna Henriette Wegner (1841–1918), a daughter of industrialist and land-owner Benjamin Wegner of Frogner Manor and Henriette Seyler, whose Hanseatic family owned Berenberg Bank. Henriette Seyler was mostly descended from Hamburg Hanseatic families such as Berenberg/Gossler and Amsinck and families of the Basel patriciate such as Merian, Burckhardt and Faesch, and more distantly from the Welser banking family. Bernhard and Henriette were the parents of surgeon and President of the Norwegian Red Cross &quot;Nikolai Nissen Paus&quot; (1877–1956), engineer and CEO of Akershus Energi &quot;Augustin Thoresen Paus&quot; (1881–1945), and lawyer and Director at the Norwegian Employers&#x27; Confederation &quot;George Wegner Paus&quot; (1882–1923).

Nikolai Nissen Paus was the father of surgeon and Grand Master of the Norwegian Order of Freemasons &quot;Bernhard Paus&quot; (1910–1999), who was married to humanitarian Brita Collett (1917–1998), daughter of land-owner Axel Collett. Their children included Secretary of State &quot;Lucie Paus Falck&quot;, former CEO of NCC in Norway &quot;Nikolai Paus&quot; and surgeon &quot;Albert Collett Paus&quot;.

==Seals and coats of arms==

Parish priest in Hjartdal Povel Pedersson Paus (1625–1682), who signed the 1661 Sovereignty Act—the new Constitution of Denmark-Norway—as one of the 87 representatives of the clerical estate, used a seal with a reversed crane in its vigilance. His name is written in Latin as &quot;Paulus Petri Windius&quot;, i.e. with his patronymic and place of birth, Vinje. He used the same seal on the 1664–1666 census. Pliny the Elder wrote down the ancient legend that cranes would appoint one of their number to stand guard while they slept. The sentry would hold a stone in its claw, so that if it fell asleep it would drop the stone and wake the other cranes.

Hans Krag includes two coats of arms used by family members in the first volume of &quot;Norsk heraldisk mønstring&quot; with arms of Norwegian higher officials from Frederick IV&#x27;s reign: Povel Paus&#x27; son, district judge of Upper Telemark Cornelius Paus (1662–1723) used a coat of arms featuring a wild man, and Cornelius&#x27; nephew and successor as district judge, Peder Paus (1691–1759), used a coat of arms featuring a dove with olive branch standing on a serpent.

The modern coat of arms was adopted in the late 19th century, based on an 18th-century interpretation of an ambiguous seal from 1330 used by the lawspeaker of Oslo, Nikolas Paus. It was later given its current design by Hallvard Trætteberg, Norway&#x27;s preeminent heraldic artist in the 20th century. It is blazoned in Trætteberg&#x27;s book &quot;Norske By- og Adelsvåben&quot; as &quot;in red, silver bull&#x27;s head with neck, at the top dexter [six-pointed] golden star.&quot; This coat of arms is also used in the comital letters patent of Christopher Paus.

In his book &quot;Heraldisk nøkkel&quot;, Herman Leopoldus Løvenskiold mentions four arms associated with the name Paus, including the two arms mentioned in Krag&#x27;s book, the arms with a bull&#x27;s head and star, and an arms with six roundels (3.3) under a fess.

==Name==
The name Paus is known in Oslo since the 14th century, notably as the name of the Lawspeaker of Oslo Nikolas Paus (mentioned 1329–1347) and as the name of one of medieval Oslo&#x27;s &quot;city farms&quot;, &quot;Pausinn&quot; (mentioned 1324–1482). Genealogist S. H. Finne-Grønn wrote that the name of the modern family was in one way or the other in all likelihood derived from individuals with the name Paus in 14th and 15th century Oslo (usually spelled Paus, but occasionally Paue, Pafue or other similar spellings), and/or from the &quot;city farm&quot; of &quot;Pausinn&quot; in Oslo which was probably named after them.

The name is believed to be of Middle Saxon or Middle Dutch origin; the influence of these languages upon Scandinavian during the late medieval and early modern period was profound due to trade and immigration to the cities of merchants and craftsmen from the continent. A significant proportion of the merchants and craftsmen in Oslo from the 13th century were immigrants from Northern Germany or the Low Countries. Medieval historians P.A. Munch, Alexander Bugge and Edvard Bull all believed that the name was derived from Middle Saxon/Middle Dutch (, and other spellings), used as a nickname or as a title of a priest. It is ultimately derived from Greek πάππας (, &quot;father&quot;) and is cognate with the word Pope. The &quot;Dictionary of American Family Names&quot; describes it as &quot;Dutch, North German, and Scandinavian: from Middle Low German &quot;paves&quot;, &quot;pawes&quot; ‘pope’, perhaps applied as a nickname for someone renowned for his piety.&quot; &quot;Norsk etternamnleksikon&quot; (2000) [Norwegian Encyclopedia of Family Names] also explains the name as derived from Middle Saxon/Middle Dutch &quot;paus&quot;.

Family names were not widely used in Norway until relatively recently, and were rarely used during the 16th and 17th centuries. Hence, the extant family&#x27;s earliest known certain ancestors often used given names and patronymics. However, occasional use of the name Paus is documented for the first known certain ancestors; in 1644 the name was used in an oration in Greek, printed by Ulrich Balck at the University of Franeker, where Anders Hansson Paus (b. 1622) thanked his father &quot;Johannes Paulinus Pausius&quot; (i.e. Hans Povelsson Paus b. 1587) and four other benefactors (Chancellor Jens Bjelke, Bjelke&#x27;s son-in-law Sten Willumsen Rosenvinge, Daniel Bildt and Bishop of Oslo Oluf Boesen) who paid for his education. A copy is held by The Royal Library, Denmark. From the mid 17th century family members started to use the name more regularly, as the custom of using family names became more widespread in families of the clergy, nobility and eventually the bourgeoisie.

Outside of Norway, family members sometimes spelled the name &quot;de Paus&quot; or &quot;von Paus&quot; depending on linguistic context since the late 19th century. Christopher Tostrup Paus (b. 1862), a papal chamberlain, was ennobled under the name de Paus by Pope Pius XI in 1923, and the spelling is used e.g. in the &quot;Acta Apostolicae Sedis&quot; and &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;; Thorleif Paus (b. 1881), the Norwegian consul-general in Vienna, was officially known as von Paus in Austria-Hungary since he became attached to the consulate-general in 1902, as was his family. Some family members spelled the name &quot;Pauss&quot; during most of the 19th century, but reverted to the older spelling &quot;Paus&quot; around the turn of the century.

==In Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s plays==
Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s relationship with the Paus family, his parents&#x27; closest relatives, was complex and both of his parents belonged to it in either a biological or social sense. The Paus family figures in Ibsen studies, and Jon Nygaard has argued that the emergence of &quot;the new Puritan state of the officials&quot; with the spirit of &quot;Upper Telemark, the Paus family&quot; is a major theme in Ibsen&#x27;s work. Johan Kielland Bergwitz argued that &quot;it is with the Paus family that Henrik Ibsen has the most pronounced temperament traits in common.&quot; Ibsen modelled and named many literary characters for his relatives, and his plays are often set in places reminiscent of his childhood milieu in Skien. In a letter to Georg Brandes, Ibsen noted that he had used his family and childhood memories &quot;as a kind of model&quot; for the Gynt family and milieu in the play &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;. In another letter, he confirmed that the character of &quot;Åse&quot; in &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; was based on his mother. The character of &quot;Hedvig&quot; in &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; is named for Ibsen&#x27;s sister Hedvig and their grandmother Hedevig Paus. Episodes in plays such as &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; and &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; were also based on events that took place in the Altenburg/Paus household and the Paus household at Rising near Skien in the early 19th century. In an earlier draft of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, Ibsen used the name &quot;Mariane Rising,&quot; obviously named for his aunt Mariane Paus from the Rising estate, but later renamed the character &quot;Juliane Tesman,&quot; and the warm portrayal of her in the final edition is also based on his aunt. His uncle Christian Cornelius Paus, who was both the magistrate, chief of police and district judge in Skien, is regarded as an inspiration for the character of Peter Stockmann, the magistrate, chief of police etc. in &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;; they were also both descended from the real Stockmann family of Telemark.

==Paus collection==

The Paus collection is a collection of classical sculpture that forms part of the Norwegian National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, and previously of its predecessor, the National Gallery. Previously the largest private collection of classical sculpture in the Nordic countries, it was donated to the Norwegian government by papal chamberlain and count Christopher Tostrup Paus between 1918 and 1929 as the intended foundation of a Norwegian museum or department of classical sculpture.

<text>Tokugawa Nariaki (徳川 斉昭, April 4, 1800 – September 29, 1860) was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; who ruled the Mito Domain (now Ibaraki Prefecture) and contributed to the rise of nationalism and the Meiji Restoration.

== Biography ==
=== Clan leader ===
Nariaki was the 3rd son of Tokugawa Harutoshi, the seventh-generation &quot;daimyō&quot; of Mito. The family headship first passed to Harutoshi&#x27;s eldest son Narinobu, before being passed on to Nariaki in 1829.
Nariaki was also leader of the &quot;Jōi&quot; (expel the barbarian) party and made a Bakufu adviser on national defence. His childhood name was Torasaburo (虎三郎) later changed to Keisaburo (敬三郎).

=== Bakufu official ===
Nariaki was put in charge of Bakufu efforts to defend the country against encroaching foreigners. His own view was that the bakufu should strengthen its military and fight the foreigners, and was at odds with Ii Naosuke on the issue. He was pro-emperor and favored imperial restoration. Nariaki also greatly expanded the Mitogaku school established by Tokugawa Mitsukuni. He wrote a document entitled &quot;Japan, Reject the Westerners&quot; in 1853. in this document, he stated ten reasons why Japan should stay isolated from the rest of the world. He said that the Japanese people had a choice between war and peace, but clearly to him, the Japanese people should choose war so that Westerners would not intrude into Japan&#x27;s affairs.

Despite his resistance to Westernization, Nariaki was significantly influenced by the Kokugaku school. Ōkuni Takamasa, a student of Hirata Atsutane attempted to persuade him to combine ritual with technology in order to protect Japan&#x27;s borders and expand Japan as an empire. This depended on reinvigorating the Japanese &quot;national spirit&quot;. Ōkuni and Nariaki therefore laid some foundations for the Meiji restoration as well as the development of State Shinto.

Nariaki and Naosuke fought over who would succeed the Shōgun Iesada, with Nariaki championing his son Yoshinobu. Naosuke, who eventually prevailed, favored the Wakayama Domain daimyo Tokugawa Yoshitomi.

=== Legacy ===
In 1841, Nariaki built Kairaku-en, a garden whose fame lasts to this day.

Nariaki was placed under house arrest as part of the Ansei Purge 1844 in favor of his son Yoshiatsu, and died of a heart attack in 1860, at age 60.

Three of the leading figures of the 1860s were in fact natural brothers, all being sons of Nariaki: Hitotsubashi Yoshinobu, who became the 15th and last shōgun as Tokugawa Yoshinobu in 1866; Tokugawa Yoshiatsu of Mito; and Ikeda Yoshinori of Inaba (Tottori).

<doc id="325133" wikidata="Q662182" url="?curid=325133" title="Lepontii">
<text>The Lepontii were an ancient Celtic people occupying portions of Rhaetia (in modern Switzerland and Northern Italy) in the Alps during the late Bronze Age/Iron Age. Recent archeological excavations and their association with the Golasecca culture (9th-7th centuries BC) and Canegrate culture (13th century BC) point to a Celtic affiliation. From the analysis of their language and the place names of the old Lepontic areas, it was hypothesized that these people represent a layer similar to that Celtic but previous to the Gallic penetration in the Po valley. The suggestion has been made that the Lepontii may have been celticized Ligurians.

The chief towns of the Lepontii were &quot;Oscela&quot;, now Domodossola, Italy, and &quot;Bilitio&quot;, now Bellinzona, Switzerland. Their territory included the southern slopes of the St. Gotthard Pass and Simplon Pass, corresponding roughly to present-day Ossola and Ticino.

A map of Rhaetia shows the location of the Lepontic territory, in the south-western corner of Rhaetia. The area to the south, including what was to become the Insubrian capital Mediolanum (modern Milan), was Etruscan around 600-500 BC, when the Lepontii began writing tombstone inscriptions in their alphabet, one of several Etruscan-derived alphabets in the Rhaetian territory.

<doc id="325137" wikidata="Q1520581" url="?curid=325137" title="Liberalism and progressivism within Islam">
<text>Professed Muslims have created a considerable body of progressive interpretation of Islamic understanding and practice. Their work is sometimes characterized as &quot;progressive&quot; ( &quot;&quot;) or &quot;liberal&quot; Islam. Some scholars, such as Omid Safi, differentiate between &quot;progressive Muslims&quot; (post-colonial, anti-imperialist, and critical of modernity) versus &quot;liberal advocates of Islam&quot; (an older movement embracing modernity). Liberal Islam originally emerged out of the Islamic revivalist movement of the 18th–19th centuries. Liberal and progressive ideas within Islam are considered controversial by some traditional Muslims, who criticize liberal Muslims on the grounds of being too Western and/or rationalistic.

The methodologies of liberal and progressive Islam rest on the re-interpretation of traditional Islamic sacred scriptures (the Quran) and other texts (the Hadith), a process called &quot;ijtihad&quot;. This reinterpreting can vary from minor to fundamental, including re-interpretation based on the belief that while the meaning of the Quran is a revelation, its expression in words is the work of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in his particular time and context.

Liberal Muslims see themselves as returning to the principles of the early &quot;ummah&quot; and as promoting the ethical and pluralistic intent of the Quran. The reform movement uses monotheism (&quot;tawhid&quot;) as &quot;an organizing principle for human society and the basis of religious knowledge, history, metaphysics, aesthetics, and ethics, as well as social, economic and world order&quot;.

Liberal Muslims affirm the promotion of progressive values such as democracy, gender equality, human rights, LGBT rights, women&#x27;s rights, religious pluralism, interfaith marriage, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, and freedom of religion; opposition to theocracy and total rejection of Islamism and Islamic fundamentalism; and a modern view of Islamic theology, ethics, &quot;sharia&quot;, culture, tradition, and other ritualistic practices in Islam. Liberal Muslims claim that the re-interpretation of the Islamic scriptures is important in order to preserve their relevance in the 21st century.

== Background in Islamic philosophy ==
The rise of Islam, based on both the transmission of the Quran and the life of Muhammad, strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. Early Islamic philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between religion and science, and the process of &quot;ijtihad&quot; to find truth — in effect, all philosophy was &quot;political&quot; as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the &quot;rationalist&quot; Muʿtazilite philosophers, who held a more Hellenistic view, emphasizing reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the Caliphate. By the late ancient period, the &quot;traditionalist&quot; Ashʿarīte theology had in general triumphed in Islam. According to the Ashʿarītes, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the &quot;sunnah&quot;.

=== Ibn Rushd ===

Ibn Rushd, often Latinized as Averroes, was an Andalusian polymath. Being described as &quot;founding father of secular thought in Western Europe&quot;, he was known by the nickname &quot;the Commentator&quot; for his precious commentaries on Aristotle&#x27;s works. His main work was &quot;The Incoherence of the Incoherence&quot; in which he defended philosophy against al-Ghazali&#x27;s claims in &quot;The Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;. His other works were the &quot;Fasl al-Maqal&quot; and the &quot;Kitab al-Kashf&quot;. Ibn Rushd presented an argument in &quot;Fasl al-Maqal&quot; (&quot;Decisive Treatise&quot;) providing a justification for the emancipation of science and philosophy from official Ash&#x27;ari theology and that there is no inherent contradiction between philosophy and religion; thus Averroism has been considered a precursor to modern secularism. Ibn Rushd accepts the principle of women&#x27;s equality. According to him they should be educated and allowed to serve in the military; the best among them might be tomorrow&#x27;s philosophers or rulers. The 13th-century philosophical movement in Latin Christian and Jewish tradition based on Ibn Rushd&#x27;s work is called Averroism. Ibn Rushd became something of a symbolic figure in the debate over the decline and proposed revitalization of Islamic thought and Islamic society in the later 20th century. A notable proponent of such a revival of Averroist thought in Islamic society was Mohammed Abed al-Jabri with his &quot;Critique de la Raison Arabe&quot; (1982).

=== Rifa&#x27;a al-Tahtawi ===
Egyptian Egyptologist and renaissance intellectual Rifa&#x27;a al-Tahtawi (1801−1873) is considered one of the early adapters to Islamic Modernism. Islamic Modernists attempted to integrate Islamic principles with European social theories. In 1831, Rifa&#x27;a al-Tahtawi was part of the statewide effort to modernize the Egyptian infrastructure and education. They introduced his Egyptian audience to Enlightenment ideas such as secular authority and political rights and liberty; his ideas regarding how a modern civilized society ought to be and what constituted by extension a civilized or &quot;good Egyptian&quot;; and his ideas on public interest and public good. Tahtawi&#x27;s work was the first effort in what became an Egyptian renaissance (&quot;nahda&quot;) that flourished in the years between 1860 and 1940.

In 1826, Al-Tahtawi was sent to Paris by Mehmet Ali. There, he studied at an educational mission for five years, returning in 1831. Tahtawi was appointed director of the School of Languages. At the school, he worked translating European books into Arabic. Tahtawi was instrumental in translating military manuals, geography, and European history. In total, al-Tahtawi supervised the translation of over 2,000 foreign works into Arabic. He even made favorable comments about French society in some of his books. Tahtawi stressed that the Principles of Islam are compatible with those of European Modernity. In his piece, &quot;The Extraction of Gold or an Overview of Paris,&quot; Tahtawi discusses the patriotic responsibility of citizenship. He uses Roman civilization as an example for what could become of Islamic civilizations; at one point all Romans are united under one Caesar but split into East and West. After splitting, the two nations see &quot;all its wars ended in defeat, and it retreated from a perfect existence to nonexistence.&quot; Tahtawi understands that if Egypt is unable to remain united, it could fall prey to outside invaders. He stresses the importance of citizens defending the patriotic duty of their country. One way to protect one&#x27;s country according to Tahtawi, is to accept the changes that come with a modern society.

=== Muhammad Abduh ===

Egyptian Islamic jurist and religious scholar Muhammad Abduh, regarded as one of the key founding figures of Islamic Modernism, broke the rigidity of the Muslim ritual, dogma, and family ties. Abduh argued that Muslims could not simply rely on the interpretations of texts provided by medieval clerics, they needed to use reason to keep up with changing times. He said that in Islam man was not created to be led by a bridle, man was given intelligence so that he could be guided by knowledge. According to Abduh, a teacher&#x27;s role was to direct men towards study. He believed that Islam encouraged men to detach from the world of their ancestors and that Islam reproved the slavish imitation of tradition. He said that the two greatest possessions relating to religion that man was graced with were independence of will and independence of thought and opinion. It was with the help of these tools that he could attain happiness. He believed that the growth of western civilization in Europe was based on these two principles. He thought that Europeans were roused to act after a large number of them were able to exercise their choice and to seek out facts with their minds. In his works, he portrays God as educating humanity from its childhood through its youth and then on to adulthood. According to him, Islam is the only religion whose dogmas can be proven by reasoning. He was against polygamy and thought that it was an archaic custom. He believed in a form of Islam that would liberate men from enslavement, provide equal rights for all human beings, abolish the religious scholar&#x27;s monopoly on exegesis and abolish racial discrimination and religious compulsion.

Muhammad Abduh claimed in his book &quot;Al-Idtihad fi Al-Nasraniyya wa Al-Islam&quot; that no one had exclusive religious authority in the Islamic world. He argued that the Caliph did not represent religious authority, because he was not infallible nor was the Caliph the person whom the revelation was given to; therefore, according to Abduh, the Caliph and other Muslims are equal. ʿAbduh argued that the Caliph should have the respect of the ummah but not rule it; the unity of the umma is a moral unity which does not prevent its division into national states. Mohammad Abduh made great efforts to preach harmony between Sunnis and Shias. Broadly speaking, he preached brotherhood between all schools of thought in Islam. Abduh regularly called for better friendship between religious communities. As Christianity was the second biggest religion in Egypt, he devoted special efforts towards friendship between Muslims and Christians. He had many Christian friends and many a time he stood up to defend Copts.

=== Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd ===

Egyptian Qur&#x27;anic thinker, author, academic Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd is one of the leading liberal theologians in Islam. He is famous for his project of a humanistic Qur&#x27;anic hermeneutics, which &quot;challenged mainstream views&quot; on the Qur&#x27;an sparking &quot;controversy and debate&quot;. While not denying that the Qur&#x27;an was of divine origin, Zayd argued that it was a &quot;cultural product&quot; that had to be read in the context of the language and culture of seventh century Arabs, and could be interpreted in more than one way. He also criticized the use of religion to exert political power. In 1995 an Egyptian Sharia court declared him an apostate, this led to threats of death and his fleeing Egypt several week later. He later &quot;quietly&quot; returned to Egypt where he died. According to scholar Navid Kermani &quot;three key themes&quot; emerge from Abu Zayd&#x27;s work:

# to trace the various interpretations and historical settings of the single Qur&#x27;anic text from the early days of Islam up to the present;
# to demonstrate the &quot;interpretational diversity&quot; () that exists within the Islamic tradition;
# and to show how this diversity has been &quot;increasingly neglected&quot; across Islamic history.

Abu Zayd saw himself as an heir to the Muʿtazila, &quot;particularly their idea of the created Qurʿān and their tendency toward metaphorical interpretation&quot;. Abu Zayd strongly opposed the belief in a &quot;single, precise and valid interpretation of the Qur&#x27;an handed down by the Prophet for all times&quot;. In his view, the Quran made Islamic Arab culture a &#x27;culture of the text` () par excellence, but because the language of the Quran is not self-explanatory, this implied Islamic Arab culture was also a culture of interpretation (). Abu Zayd emphasized &quot;intellect&quot; () in understanding the Quran, as opposed to &quot;a hermeneutical approach which gives priority to the narrated traditions [ hadith ]&quot; (). As a reflection of this Abu Zayd used the term (interpretation) for efforts to understand the Quran, while in the Islamic sciences, the literature that explained the Quran was referred to as (commentary, explanation). For Abu Zayd, interpretation goes beyond explanation or commentary, &quot;for without&quot; the Qur&#x27;an would not have meaning:

The [Qur&#x27;anic] text changed from the very first moment - that is, when the Prophet recited it at the moment of its revelation - from its existence as a divine text (&quot;nass ilahi&quot;), and became something understandable, a human text (&quot;nass insani&quot;), because it changed from revelation to interpretation (&quot;li-annahu tahawwala min al-tanzil ila al-ta&#x27;wil&quot;). The Prophet&#x27;s understanding of the text is one of the first phases of movement resulting from the text&#x27;s connection with the human intellect.

Abu Zayd&#x27;s critical approach to classical and contemporary Islamic discourse in the fields of theology, philosophy, law, politics, and humanism, promoted modern Islamic thought that might enable Muslims to build a bridge between their own tradition and the modern world of freedom of speech, equality (minority rights, women&#x27;s rights, social justice), human rights, democracy and globalisation.

=== Ali Shariati ===

Ali Shariati Mazinani (Persian: علی شریعتی مزینانی, 23 November 1933 – 18 June 1977) was an Iranian revolutionary and sociologist who focused on the sociology of religion. He believed that Socialism was compatible with Islam and, in fact, that it was from the beginning. It seems that his eagerness to explore socialism began with the translation of the book &quot;Abu Zarr: The God-Worshipping Socialist&quot; by the Egyptian thinker Abdul Hamid Jowdat-al-Sahar (ar:عبد الحميد جودة السحار). According to this book, Abu Dhar was the very first socialist. Then, Shariarti&#x27;s father declared that his son believed that the principles of Abu Dhar are fundamental. Even some thinkers described Shariati as the modern-day Abu Dhar in Iran. Of all his thoughts, there is his insistence on the necessity of revolutionary action. Shariati believed that Marxism could not provide the Third World with the ideological means for its own liberation. One of his premises was that Islam by nature is a revolutionary ideology. Therefore, Islam could relate to the modern world as an ideology. According to Shariati, the historical and original origin of human problems was the emergence of private ownership. He believed that in the modern era, the appearance of the machine was the second most fundamental change in the human condition. In fact, private ownership and the emergence of the machine, if considered one of two curves of history, belong to the second period of history. The first period is collective ownership. However, Shariati gave a critique of the historical development of religion and the modern philosophical and ideological movements and their relationship to both private ownership and the emergence of the machine.

In addition to socialism, he believed in women&#x27;s rights, as evidenced in his book &quot;Fatima Is Fatima&quot;, where he argued that Fatima Zahra the daughter of the Islamic prophet Muhammad is as a role model for Muslim women around the world and a woman who was free. She was described as , &#x27;the symbol of a responsible, fighting woman when facing her time and the fate of her society.&#x27; Also, he criticised Western liberal democracy for its direct relationship to the plundering of Third World nations and instead promoted Commitment Democracy. Commitment Democracy was, according to Shariati, the government of Imam Ali. For explaining better the commitment to democracy, he at first divides between two concepts. One of them is Syasat and the other is politic. Syasat is a philosophy by the government that want to have the responsibility of changing and becoming the society, not its being and existence. In fact, Syasat is a progressive and dynamic thing. The aim of the government in the philosophy of Syasat is to change social foundations, institutions and even all the norms of society namely culture, morality and desires etc. in simple word, Syasat want to make exist the people. On contrary, there is no making in politics. In other words, politics is the following of having people not making them. Of course, Shariati prefers Syasat on politics because the former is more progressive. He considers making human (Ensan Sazi). In fact, his utopia is constructed with three concepts of Gnosis, equality and freedom. Commitment democracy appeared out of his lecture in Hoseyniyeh Ershad; a famous lecture with the name of Ummah and Imamate. According to him, an Imam is one who wants to guide humans not only in political, social and economic dimensions but also in all existential dimensions. He believes that Imam is alive everywhere and every time. On one hand, Imamate is not a metaphysical belief but a revolutionary guide philosophy. He added that Imam has to guide people not according to his desire like a dictator but to Islamic ideology and authentic values.

===Ijtihad===

Ijtihad (lit. &quot;effort, physical or mental, expended in a particular activity&quot;) is an Islamic legal term referring to independent reasoning or the thorough exertion of a jurist&#x27;s mental faculty in finding a solution to a legal question. It is contrasted with &quot;taqlid&quot; (imitation, conformity to legal precedent). According to classical Sunni theory, &quot;ijtihad&quot; requires expertise in the Arabic language, theology, revealed texts, and principles of jurisprudence (&quot;usul al-fiqh&quot;), and is not employed where authentic and authoritative texts (Qur&#x27;an and hadith) are considered unambiguous with regard to the question, or where there is an existing scholarly consensus (&quot;ijma&quot;). Ijtihad is considered to be a religious duty for those qualified to perform it. An Islamic scholar who is qualified to perform &quot;ijtihad&quot; is called a &quot;mujtahid&quot;.

Starting from the 18th century, some Muslim reformers began calling for abandonment of &quot;taqlid&quot; and emphasis on &quot;ijtihad&quot;, which they saw as a return to Islamic origins. Public debates in the Muslim world surrounding &quot;ijtihad&quot; continue to the present day. The advocacy of &quot;ijtihad&quot; has been particularly associated with Islamic modernists. Among contemporary Muslims in the West there have emerged new visions of &quot;ijtihad&quot; which emphasize substantive moral values over traditional juridical methodology.

===Reinterpreting Quranic verse Al-Baqara 256===
==Specific issues==
=== Feminism ===
A combination of Islam and feminism has been advocated as &quot;a feminist discourse and practice articulated within an Islamic paradigm&quot; by Margot Badran in 2002. Islamic feminists ground their arguments in Islam and its teachings, seek the full equality of women and men in the personal and public sphere, and can include non-Muslims in the discourse and debate. Islamic feminism is defined by Islamic scholars as being more radical than secular feminism, and as being anchored within the discourse of Islam with the Quran as its central text.

During recent times, the concept of Islamic feminism has grown further with Islamic groups looking to garner support from many aspects of society. In addition, educated Muslim women are striving to articulate their role in society.
Examples of Islamic feminist groups are the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan, founded by Meena Keshwar Kamal, Muslim Women&#x27;s Quest for Equality from India, and Sisters in Islam from Malaysia, founded by Zainah Anwar and Amina Wadud among other five women.

In 2014, the Selangor Islamic Religious Council (MAIS) issued a fatwa declaring that Sisters In Islam, as well as any other organisation promoting religious liberalism and pluralism, deviate from the teachings of Islam. According to the edict, publications that are deemed to promote liberal and pluralistic religious thinking are to be declared unlawful and confiscated, while social media is also to be monitored and restricted. As fatwas are legally binding in Malaysia, SIS is challenging it on constitutional grounds.

====Reinterpreting Quranic verse An-Nisa 34 ====
Traditionally interpreted as mandating wives&#x27; obedience to their husbands and beating as a punishment for disobedience, Progressive Muslims have given many alternative interpretations of the verse, Quran 4:34.

Riffat Hassan, has taken the view that &quot;qawwamun&quot; in the verse is not talking about men being superior to women, but rather is referring to men&#x27;s role as breadwinners. &quot;Nushuz&quot; is interpreted as not referring to domestic disobedience but to a mass rebellion of all women against their role as child-bearer. Asma Barlas has taken a similar view that &quot;qawwamun&quot; means moral guidance or caring, &quot;nushuz&quot; means disharmony, and that &quot;wa-dribuhunna&quot; has multiple meanings, such as &quot;to set an example&quot; or &quot;to separate&quot;, and that &quot;to beat&quot; is &quot;the worst one!&quot; of all possible interpretations.

Amina Wadud has stated that &quot;qawwamun&quot; refers to men&#x27;s financial support of women while &quot;nushuz&quot; is referring to disharmony in the relationship. She interprets &quot;wa-dribuhunna&quot;, the word often translated as &quot;strike&quot; or &quot;beat&quot;, as being used in a non-literal sense.

Laleh Bakhtiar, in her Quran translation, &quot;The Sublime Quran&quot;, translated &quot;wa-dribuhunna&quot; as &quot;to go away from&quot; or &quot;to leave&quot;, claiming the verse recommends husbands to leave their wives if there are irreconcilable disagreements and differences. She cites prophetic biographies claiming Muhammad never beat his wives and talking about his respect for women, and other Quran verses like 2:231.

Laury Silvers, based on the methodology of medieval Islamic thinker Ibn Arabi, believes that &quot;God may intend all meanings, but it does not follow that he &quot;approves&quot; of all meanings.&quot; Using this, she believes that the Quran has to be ambiguous, as if it wasn&#x27;t, there would be no room for human responsibility. Using this, she claims that Allah did intend for all meanings of &quot;wa-dribuhunna&quot;, including beating, and that true human morality comes from the freedom to choose the best of these interpretations. It is claimed Muhammad never beating his wives and his &quot;conflicted response&quot; to this revelation shows that God revealed it out of necessity (to restrain existing violence against women) rather than out of approval, and that it remains best to refrain from violence entirely.

Khaled Abou El Fadl claims &quot;nushuz&quot; is better understood as &quot;a grave and known sin&quot; and in 4:34, this is a lewd act or sexual sin that can be proven by evidence and verified by a judge. According to his interpretation, 4:34 is about how a judge would punish a woman for a sexual crime, rather than about wifely disobedience. Fatema Mernissi cites Quran 33:35 as evidence for gender equality within Islam and several hadith to claim that while beating was permissible, the best Muslims would never beat their wives.

Edip Yüksel in his Qauran translation, &quot;The Quran: A Reformist Translation&quot;, interprets &quot;qawwamun&quot; as &quot;supporters&quot; rather than as &quot;guardians&quot; or &quot;in charge of&quot;, citing other Quran verses using the word. Furthermore, he believes &quot;nushuz&quot; is not referring to disobedience, but instead an extramarital affair or marital disloyalty, citing Quran 4:128. Finally, he claims &quot;idribuhunna&quot; does not mean beating, but rather means separation, saying beating would not make sense with Quran 30:21 stating that marriage is tranquil.

===Human rights===

Moderate Islamic political thought contends that the nurturing of the Muslim identity and the propagation of values such as democracy and human rights are not mutually exclusive, but rather should be promoted together. Most liberal Muslims believe that Islam promotes the notion of absolute equality of all humanity, and that it is one of its central concepts. Therefore, a breach of human rights has become a source of great concern to most liberal Muslims.

Liberal Muslims differ with their culturally conservative counterparts in that they believe that all humanity is represented under the umbrella of human rights. Many Muslim majority countries have signed international human rights treaties, although the impact of these largely remains to be seen in local legal systems. Muslim liberals often reject traditional interpretations of Islamic law, which allows Ma malakat aymanukum and slavery. They say that slavery opposed Islamic principles which they believe to be based on justice and equality and some say that verses relating to slavery or &quot;Ma malakat aymanukum&quot; now can not be applied due to the fact that the world has changed, while others say that those verses are totally misinterpreted and twisted to legitimize slavery. In the 20th century, South Asian scholars Ghulam Ahmed Pervez and Amir Ali argued that the expression &quot;ma malakat aymanukum&quot; should be properly read in the past tense. When some called for reinstatement of slavery in Pakistan upon its independence from the British colonial rule, Pervez argued that the past tense of this expression means that the Quran had imposed &quot;an unqualified ban&quot; on slavery. Liberal Muslims have argued against death penalty for apostasy based on the Quranic verse that &quot;There shall be no compulsion in religion&quot;.

=== LGBTQ rights ===
In January 2013, the Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity (MASGD) was launched. The organization was formed by members of the Queer Muslim Working Group, with the support of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. Several initial MASGD members previously had been involved with the Al-Fatiha Foundation, including Faisal Alam and Imam Daayiee Abdullah.

The Safra Project for women is based in the UK. It supports and works on issues relating to prejudice LGBTQ Muslim women. It was founded in October 2001 by Muslim LBT women. The Safra Project&#x27;s &quot;ethos is one of inclusiveness and diversity&quot;. In Australia, Nur Wahrsage has been an advocate for LGBTI Muslims and founded Marhaba, a support group for queer Muslims in Melbourne, Australia. In May 2016, Wahrsage revealed that he is homosexual in an interview on SBS2’s The Feed, being the first openly gay Imam in Australia.

In Canada, Salaam was founded as the first gay Muslim organization in Canada and the second in the world. Salaam was found in 1993 by El-Farouk Khaki, who organized the Salaam / Al-Fateha International Conference in 2003. In May 2009, the Toronto Unity Mosque / el-Tawhid Juma Circle (ETJC) was founded by Laury Silvers, a University of Toronto religious studies scholar, alongside Muslim gay-rights activists El-Farouk Khaki and Troy Jackson. Unity Mosque / ETJC is a gender-equal, LGBT+ affirming.

In November 2012, a prayer room was set up in Paris by gay Islamic scholar and founder of the group Homosexual Muslims of France, Ludovic-Mohamed Zahed. It was described by the press as the first gay-friendly mosque in Europe. The reaction from the rest of the Muslim community in France has been mixed, and the opening has been condemned by the Grand Mosque of Paris. Examples of Muslim LGBT media works are the 2006 Channel 4&#x27;s documentary &quot;Gay Muslims&quot;, the film production company Unity Productions Foundation, the 2007 and 2015 documentary films &quot;A Jihad for Love&quot; and &quot;A Sinner in Mecca&quot;, both produced by Parvez Sharma, and the Jordanian LGBT publication &quot;My.Kali&quot;.

==== Story of Lut ====
===Secularism===

The definition and application of secularism, especially the place of religion in society, varies among Muslim countries as it does among non-Muslim countries. As the concept of secularism varies among secularists in the Muslim world, reactions of Muslim intellectuals to the pressure of secularization also varies. On the one hand, secularism is condemned by some Muslim intellectuals who do not feel that religious influence should be removed from the public sphere. On the other hand, secularism is claimed by others to be compatible with Islam. For example, the quest for secularism has inspired some Muslim scholars who argue that secular government is the best way to observe &quot;sharia&quot;; &quot;enforcing [sharia] through coercive power of the state negates its religious nature, because Muslims would be observing the law of the state and not freely performing their religious obligation as Muslims&quot; says Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na&#x27;im, a professor of law at Emory University and author of &quot;Islam and the secular state : negotiating the future of Shariʻa&quot;. Moreover, some scholars argue that secular states have existed in the Muslim world since the Middle Ages.

===Egalitarianism===

 Islam is often described as possessing a &quot;decidedly egalitarian spirit&quot;, and &quot;in principle egalitarian, recognizing no superiority of one believer over another by birth or descent, race or nationality, or social status&quot;. Nonetheless, Muslims known as Sayyids (those accepted as descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad) have special privileges in Islam, notably of tax exemptions and a share in Khums. Discrimination also exists in regards of intermarriage between persons of Arab and non-Arab lineages, as can be found in a number of fatwa sites.
*According to Darul Ifta Birmingham (Hanafi fiqh) quoting Raddul Muhtar: &#x27;An Ajmi (non-Arab) cannot be a match for a woman of Arab descent, no matter that he be an &quot;Aalim&quot; (religious scholar) or even a Sultan (ruling authority).&#x27;
*The website Islamic Virtues quotes the Shafi’i manual &quot;Reliance of the Traveller and Tools of the Worshipper&quot;: &#x27;And the &quot;ajami&quot; (non-Arab) is not suitable for an Arab woman&#x27;, ... &quot; (the quote goes on to discourage marriages between Muslims of different tribes). 
*Still another site (&quot;Answered according to Shafi&#x27;i Fiqh by Qibla.com ... Answered by Shaykh Amjad Rasheed&quot;) states: &quot;… most of the scholars do consider this aspect [i.e. lineage] for suitability, therefore a non-Arab is not suitable for an Arab. And a non-Qurayshi is not suitable for a Qurayshi woman …&quot;

This is notably in direct contrast to the Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s last sermon, &quot;...All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over a black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action.&quot;

==Movements==

Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, in accordance with their increasingly modern societies and outlooks, liberal Muslims have tended to reinterpret many aspects of the application of their religion in their life in an attempt to reconnect. This is particularly true of Muslims who now find themselves living in non-Muslim countries.

===&quot;Reformation of Islam&quot;===
Many (including Thomas Friedman and Ayaan Hirsi Ali) have advocated for an &quot;Islamic reformation&quot; to modernize and liberalize Islam, arguing that the basis of extremism/radicalism/violent jihad is not deviant Islam but the puritanical, literal and supremacist interpretations of Islam found in mainstream and conservative Islam. Often, the Protestant Reformation and “a Muslim Martin Luther” are mentioned.

====Doubts about a religious reformation====
But scholars have found contradictions with this theory. 

Max Rodenbeck has observed several challenges to &quot;reform&quot;—i.e. accommodation with the Enlightenment, reason and science, and the separation of religion and politics—that the other two Abrahamic faiths did not have to grapple with. 
[W]hereas Christian and Jewish reform evolved over centuries, in relatively organic and self-generated—albeit often bloody—fashion, the challenge to Islam of such concepts as empirical reasoning, the nation-state, the theory of evolution, and individualism arrived all in a heap and all too often at the point of a gun.

In addition, traditional sharia law has been shaped in all its complexity by serving for centuries as &quot;the backbone&quot; of legal systems of Muslim states, while millions of Muslim now live in non-Muslim states. Islam also lacks a &quot;widely recognized religious hierarchy to explain doctrinal changes or to enforce them&quot; because it has no [central] church.

Mustafa Akyol points out that the very unreformed Muslim Ottoman Empire was known for its tolerance towards its Christian minorities (a major goal of reformation advocates) and permitted &quot;every man to live according to his conscience”, as one scholar of the time put it. Rage against Western ways and power came with modernity. The current state of the Muslim world resembles more the post-Reformation period of religious wars and the suppression of theological minorities in Christendom, than the pre-Reformation era.

French researcher of religious extremism Olivier Roy writes:
Radicals are not &quot;mainstream&quot; Muslims who went astray after studying the Koran and Islamic theology. You donʹt become a terrorist because you listen to a Salafist preacher ... (radicalisation occurs less in mosques than in jail). They donʹt choose radicalism (either religious or political) because of their theological studies: they want radicalism. Even if other people succeed in reforming Islam, it wonʹt change the mind of the radicals.
... no revealed religion is moderate: all religions state that, as Pope Benedict said, there is a non-negotiable truth. And the idea that any reform is &quot;liberal&quot; is nonsense: Luther and Calvin were not liberal (indeed, the former showed anti-Semitic tendencies). Of course Protestantism provided the theological basis for political reform, but also for racism (apartheid is strongly entrenched in Calvinist theology).
Secularists tend to consider that a moderate believer is somebody who believes moderately: but that is not the definition of moderation for believers; moderation for them is not about beliefs, but about accepting life in a secular society, even if they stick to conservative values. That is exactly what Muslims are learning to do.
Finally, who would be responsible for such theological reform? Liberal Muslim intellectuals? Most of them are just non-believers. Our secular states? They are forbidden by the constitution to meddle with theology. Authoritarian Muslim states? They will never encourage free theological debate, because that would mean free debate in general – in other words, democracy.
===Islamic modernism===
Islamic modernism, also sometimes referred to as modernist Salafism, is a movement that has been described as &quot;the first Muslim ideological response&quot; attempting to reconcile Islamic faith with modern Western values such as nationalism, democracy, civil rights, rationality, equality, and progress. It featured a &quot;critical reexamination of the classical conceptions and methods of jurisprudence&quot; and a new approach to Islamic theology and Quranic exegesis (Tafsir).

It was the first of several Islamic movements – including secularism, Islamism and Salafism – that emerged in the middle of the 19th century in reaction to the rapid changes of the time, especially the perceived onslaught of Western Civilization and colonialism on the Muslim world. Founders include Muhammad Abduh (1849–1905), a Sheikh of Al-Azhar University for a brief period before his death in 1905, Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani (1838–1897), and Sir Syed Ahmed Khan (1817–1898).

The early Islamic Modernists (al-Afghani and Muhammad Abdu) used the term &quot;&quot;salafiyya&quot; to refer to their attempt at renovation of Islamic thought, and this &quot;salafiyya&quot; movement&quot; is often known in the West as &quot;Islamic modernism,&quot; although it is very different from what is currently called the Salafi movement, which generally signifies &quot;ideologies such as wahhabism&quot;. Since its inception, Modernism has suffered from co-option of its original reformism by both secularist rulers and by &quot;the official &quot;ulama&quot;&quot; whose &quot;task it is to legitimise&quot; rulers&#x27; actions in religious terms. Modernism differs from secularism in that it insists on the importance of religious faith in public life, and from Salafism or Islamism in that it embraces contemporary European institutions, social processes, and values.

===Quranism===

Quranists reject the hadith and follow the Quran only. The extent to which Quranists reject the authenticity of the Sunnah varies, but the more established groups have thoroughly criticised the authenticity of the hadith and refused it for many reasons, the most prevalent being the Quranist claim that hadith is not mentioned in the Quran as a source of Islamic theology and practice, was not recorded in written form until more than two centuries after the death of the Muhammad, and contain perceived internal errors and contradictions. Quranists believe Muhammad himself was a Quranist and the founder of Quranism, and that his followers distorted the faith and split into schisms and factions such as Sunni, Shia, and Khawarij.

===Scriptural fallibility===
Some Muslims (Saeed Nasheed, Abdul Karim Soroush, Sayyed Ahmad Al-Qabbanji, Hassan Radwan) have argued for taking &quot;the bold step of challenging the very idea that the Qur’an and Sunna are infallible&quot;, and asserting that instead the Qur&#x27;an is &quot;divinely inspired but ... human-authored&quot;. Saeed Nasheed writes:
&quot;The Qur’an is not the speech of God, just as the loaf of bread is not the work of the farmer. God produced the raw material, which was inspiration, just as the farmer produces the raw material, which is wheat. But it is the baker who turns the wheat or flour into bread according to his own unique way, artistic expertise and creative ability. Thus it is the Prophet who was responsible for interpreting the inspiration and turning it into actual phrases and words according to his own unique view.&quot;

By acknowledging this, Hassan Radwan argues, Muslims will be freed to use their reason to &quot;take what is useful and helpful from religion and ignore what is not.&quot;

== Notable organizations ==

=== Muslims for Progressive Values ===

Muslims for Progressive Values (MPV) is a Progressive Muslim grassroots human rights organization founded by Ani Zonneveld and Pamela K. Taylor in 2007. In December 2013, the United Nations recognized MPV as an official non-government organization (NGO) association member. It has supported women&#x27;s rights, LGBTQ rights, and interfaith marriage.

For its progressive beliefs, the organization was expelled from the Islamic Society of North America Convention bazaar with it being accused of &quot;promoting ignorance of Islam among Muslims at the event&quot; and &quot;claiming haram was good and virtuous&quot;.

=== Sisters in Islam ===
=== Tolu-e-Islam ===

This organization was initiated by Muhammad Iqbal, and later spearheaded by Ghulam Ahmed Pervez. Ghulam Ahmed Pervez did not reject all hadiths; however, he only accepted hadiths which &quot;are in accordance with the Quran or do not stain the character of the Prophet or his companions&quot;. The organization, which does not belong to any political party or to any religious group or sect, publishes and distributes books, pamphlets, and recordings of Pervez&#x27;s teachings.

<text>Domodossola (; ) is a city and (municipality) in the Province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, in the region of Piedmont, northern Italy. It was also known as Oscela, Oscella, Oscella dei Leponzi, Ossolo, Ossola Lepontiorum, and Domo d&#x27;Ossola (due to its position in the Ossola valley). The Peruvian aviation pioneer, Jorge Chávez, died here in 1910 in an airplane crash.

==Geography==
Domodossola is situated at the confluence of the Bogna and Toce Rivers and is home to 18,300 people.

The city is located at the foot of the Italian Alps and acts as a minor passenger-rail hub. Its strategic location accommodates Swiss rail passengers, and Domodossola railway station acts as an international stopping-point between Milan and Brig (a Swiss city of German language) through the Simplon Pass (Italian: &quot;Sempione&quot;). The Domodossola–Locarno railway is a line to the east across the border to Locarno.

==History==
Domodossola was the chief town of the Lepontii when the Romans conquered the region in 12 BCE.

During World War II Domodossola was part of an uprising against the Germans, whereby the valley of Ossola declared itself a free partisan republic in September 1944 and broke away from Fascist Italy. The rebellion was crushed by German troops within less than two months but was an important symbol for anti-fascist movements within Italy until the end of the war.

==Main sights==
*Collegiate church of St. Gervasius and Protasius.

*Domodossola railway station designed by Luigi Boffi.
*&quot;Palazzo Silva&quot; (17th century).

Domodossola is most famous for the Sacro Monte Calvario, a site of pilgrimage and worship close to it that has been also recognized as a humanity heritage by UNESCO.

==Economy==
The economy is mostly based on services, the working of stones, and the mechanics industry. The valleys in the area contain many dams and hydroelectric plants.

==Culture==
Its name is widely known in Italy as part of the local spelling alphabet as the entry: &quot;D for Domodossola&quot;.
==Twin towns==
* Brig, Switzerland
* Busto Arsizio, Italy

<doc id="325139" wikidata="Q1194944" url="?curid=325139" title="Tokugawa Mitsukuni">
<text>, also known as , was a Japanese daimyo who was known for his influence in the politics of the early Edo period. He was the third son of Tokugawa Yorifusa (who in turn was the eleventh son of Tokugawa Ieyasu) and succeeded him, becoming the second daimyo of the Mito Domain.

==Biography==
Tokugawa Mitsukuni was born on July 11, 1628, in Mito Domain, Hitachi Province as the third son of Tokugawa Yorifusa, the first daimyo of Mito Domain. His father was the eleventh son of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder and first shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate. At the age of six, his elder brother Yorishige became valetudinarian, and Mitsukuni was chosen to succeed his father. At the age of nine, he underwent &quot;genpuku&quot; (coming-of-age ceremony).

He was responsible for assembling the Mitogaku scholars to compile a huge Japanese history, &quot;Dai Nihonshi&quot;. In it, Japan was depicted as a nation under the Emperor, analogous to that in Chinese dynasties. This helped the rise of nationalism in the late shogunate and in the Mito Domain later. His childhood name was Chomaru (長丸) later become Chiyomatsu (千代松) this name was personally granted by his cousin and the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemitsu.
In 1661, at age 34, he became the &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Mito Domain. He anticipated the forcible division of &quot;kami&quot; and Buddhas (&quot;shinbutsu bunri&quot;) of 1868 ordering there the destruction of a thousand Buddhist temples and the construction of at least one shrine per village (. At age 63, he was awarded the court office of gon-chūnagon, or provisional middle counsellor. In 1691, he retired to his villa, &quot;Seizan-sō&quot;.

He directed at Zuisen-ji the creation of the very first guide to Kamakura, the Shinpen Kamakurashi. The book would have a profound influence on the city in the following centuries, an influence which continues to this day in names for parts of the city like Kamakura&#x27;s Seven Mouths, Kamakura&#x27;s Ten Bridges, and other such popular monikers he coined.

In 1657 (&quot;Meireki 3&quot;) at the age of 27, he married a daughter of the kampaku Konoe Nobuhiro. He was also known as a gourmet of the Edo period. He is claimed to be one of the first Japanese to eat ramen as well as routinely enjoying such exotic food as wine and yogurt. Mitsukuni had one son, who took the Matsudaira surname. Additionally, Mitsukuni adopted the son of an elder brother; this adopted son, Tokugawa Tsunaeda, became his heir.

He died at his villa Seizansō in 1701. He posthumously received the court rank of junior first rank (1869) and first rank (1900). He is now considered to be a &quot;kami&quot;.

==Family==
* Father: Tokugawa Yorifusa
* Mother: Hisa later Kyushoin (1604-1662)
* Wife: Hiroko (1638-1659) daughter of Konoe Nobuhiro
* Concubine: Tamai-Dono
* Son: Matsudaira Yoritsune (1652-1704) of Takamatsu Domain by Tamai

==Mito Kōmon==

During the latter half of the Edo period and the Meiji period, a kōdan (narrative tale) named &quot;Mito Mitsukuni Man&#x27;yūki&quot; fictionalized the travels of Tokugawa Mitsukuni. This tradition of dramatizing his life continued with a novel and, in 1951, the first television series to portray him as a wanderer, masquerading as a commoner, who castigated the evil powers in every corner of the nation. From 1969 to 2011, the TBS ran the series &quot;Mito Kōmon&quot;, which continues to attract audiences in reruns. Episodes were re-broadcast in the early 1990s by WNYE-TV (New York City) under the title &quot;The Elder Lord of Mito&quot;.

Each summer, the city of Mito hosts the Mito Komon festival, which prominently features the Tokugawa seal, as well as actors representing Tokugawa Mitsukuni and his assistants.

<doc id="325142" wikidata="Q466530" url="?curid=325142" title="The Elder Scrolls">
<text>The Elder Scrolls is a series of action role-playing video games primarily developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. The series focuses on free-form gameplay in an open world. Most games in the series have been critically and commercially successful, with &quot;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&quot; (2002), &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot; (2011) all winning Game of the Year awards from multiple outlets. The series has sold more than 59 million copies worldwide.

Within the series&#x27; fictional universe, each game takes place on the continent of Tamriel. The setting combines pre-medieval real-world elements, such as a powerful Roman-like Empire, with high fantasy medieval themes, including limited technology, widespread magic use, and the existence of many mythological creatures. The continent is split into a number of provinces inhabited by humans and humanoid fantasy races such as elves, orcs and anthropomorphic animals. A common theme in the lore is that a chosen hero (represented by the player&#x27;s character) rises to defeat an impending threat, typically a malevolent being or an antagonistic army.

Since debuting with &quot;The Elder Scrolls: Arena&quot; in 1994, the series has produced a total of five main games (of which the last three have each featured two or three expansions) as well as several spin-offs. In 2014, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, &quot;The Elder Scrolls Online&quot;, was released by Bethesda&#x27;s affiliated ZeniMax subsidiary ZeniMax Online Studios.

== Development history ==
=== Before &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; ===

Prior to working on &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; series, Bethesda had worked predominantly with sports and action games. In the six years from its founding to &quot;Arena&quot; 1994 release, Bethesda had released ten games, six of them sports games, with titles such as &quot;Hockey League Simulator&quot;, &quot;NCAA Basketball: Road to the Final Four (&#x27;91/&#x27;92 Edition)&quot;, and &quot;Wayne Gretzky Hockey&quot;, and the remaining four adaptations from other media, primarily the &quot;Terminator&quot; series. Bethesda&#x27;s course changed abruptly when it began working on its first action role-playing game. Designer Ted Peterson recalls: &quot;I remember talking to the guys at Sir-Tech who were doing &quot;Wizardry VII: Crusaders of the Dark Savant&quot; at the time, and them literally laughing at us for thinking we could do it.&quot; Ted Peterson worked alongside Vijay Lakshman as one of the initial designers of what became known as &quot;Arena&quot;, a &quot;medieval-style gladiator game&quot;.

=== &quot;Arena&quot; ===

Peterson and Lakshman were joined by Julian Lefay who, according to Peterson, &quot;really spear-headed the initial development of the series&quot;. Peterson, Lakshman, and LeFay were longtime aficionados of pen-and-paper role-playing games, which greatly influenced the creation of the world of Tamriel. They were also fans of Looking Glass Studios&#x27; &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; series, their main inspiration for &quot;Arena&quot;. Initially, &quot;Arena&quot; was not to be a role-playing game at all. The player, and a team of their fighters, would travel the world, fighting other teams in their arenas until the player became &quot;grand champion&quot; in the world&#x27;s capital, the Imperial City. Along the way, side quests of a more role-playing nature could be completed. As the process of development progressed, however, the tournaments became less important and the side quests more. Role-playing game elements were added, as it expanded to include cities outside the arenas, and dungeons beyond the cities. Eventually it was decided to drop the idea of tournaments altogether, and focus on quests and dungeons, making the game a &quot;full-blown [role-playing game]&quot;. Although the team had dropped all arena combat from the game, all the material had already been printed up with the title, so the game went to market as &quot;The Elder Scrolls: Arena&quot;. Lakshman, who then worked at Christopher Weaver&#x27;s Bethesda Softworks, came up with the name of &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; and the words eventually came to mean &quot;Tamriel&#x27;s mystical tomes of knowledge that told of its past, present, and future&quot;. The game&#x27;s initial voice-over was changed in response, beginning: &quot;It has been foretold in the Elder Scrolls ...&quot;

Bethesda missed their Christmas 1993 deadline for releasing &quot;Arena&quot;, and the game was released in the first quarter of 1994 instead, a &quot;really serious [mistake] for a small developer/publisher like Bethesda Softworks&quot;. The packaging included a scantily clad female warrior, which further contributed to distributor concern, leading to an initial distribution of only 20,000 units. Having missed the Christmas sales season, the development team was concerned that they &quot;had screwed the company&quot;. Nevertheless, sales continued to grow, month after month, as news of the game was passed by word-of-mouth. Despite some initial software bugs, and the formidable demands the game made on players&#x27; machines, it became a cult hit. Evaluations of the game&#x27;s success varied from &quot;modest&quot; to &quot;wild&quot;. Still, the game maintained traction with its audience. Game historian Matt Barton concluded that &quot;the game set a new standard for this type of role-playing video game, and demonstrated just how much room was left for innovation&quot;.

=== &quot;Daggerfall&quot; ===
Work on &quot;The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall&quot; began after &quot;Arena&quot; release in March 1994. Ted Peterson was assigned the role of lead game designer. He endeavoured to make &quot;Daggerfall&quot; plot less &quot;clichéd&quot; than &quot;Arena&quot; and involve a &quot;complex series of adventures leading to multiple resolutions&quot;. With &quot;Daggerfall&quot;, &quot;Arena&quot; experience-point-based system was replaced with one rewarding the player for conducting role-playing activities with their character. &quot;Daggerfall&quot; came equipped with an improved character generation engine, one that included a GURPS-influenced class creation system, offering players the chance to create their own classes, and assign their own skills. &quot;Daggerfall&quot; was developed with an XnGine engine, one of the first truly 3D engines. &quot;Daggerfall&quot; realized a game world the size of Great Britain, filled with 15,000 towns and a population of 750,000. It was influenced by analog games and literature that Julian LeFay or Ted Peterson happened to be playing or reading at the time, such as Dumas&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; and &quot;&quot;. It was released in September 1996. Like &quot;Arena&quot;, &quot;Daggerfall&quot; initial release suffered from some bugs, leaving consumers disgruntled. These early anomalies were fixed in later versions. This experience led to a more prudent release schedule for future games.

=== &quot;Battlespire&quot; and &quot;Redguard&quot; ===

Following the release of &quot;Daggerfall&quot;, work began on three separate projects at once: &quot;An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire&quot;, &quot;The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard&quot;, and &quot;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&quot;. &quot;Battlespire&quot;, originally titled &quot;Dungeon of Daggerfall: Battlespire&quot;, was the first of the three to be released, on November 30, 1997. Originally designed as an expansion pack for &quot;Daggerfall&quot;, it was eventually rebranded as a standalone game. &quot;Battlespire&quot; focused on dungeon romping and offered multiplayer gaming in the form of a player versus player deathmatch mode, the only series title to do so prior to the release of &quot;The Elder Scrolls Online&quot; in 2014. &quot;Redguard&quot; was the second of the three titles to be released, on October 31, 1998. It was an action-adventure game inspired by &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, and the &quot;Ultima&quot; series. &quot;Redguard&quot; did not offer the player the chance to create their own character. Instead, players would play the prefabricated &quot;Cyrus the Redguard&quot;. Both games did poorly with Bethesda&#x27;s target audience. Players used to the vast open spaces of &quot;Daggerfall&quot; did not take well to the reduced worlds of &quot;Redguard&quot; and &quot;Battlespire&quot;. Based upon its customers&#x27; clear desire for massive role-playing game worlds, Bethesda redoubled its efforts to build the next major chapter.

=== &quot;Morrowind&quot; ===
The third title in &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; series was conceived during the development of &quot;Daggerfall&quot;. Initially designed to encompass the whole province of Morrowind and allow the player to join all five Dunmer Great Houses, it was decided that the scope of the game was too much for the technology available at the time. At publication, it covered the province&#x27;s central isle of Vvardenfell and allowed the player to join three of the Great Houses. The XnGine was scrapped and replaced with Numerical Design Limited&#x27;s Gamebryo, a Direct3D-powered engine with transform, clipping, and lighting capacity, 32-bit textures and skeletal animation. It was decided that the game world would be populated using the methods the team had developed in &quot;Redguard&quot;; with the game objects crafted by hand, rather than generated using random algorithmic methods.

The project took &quot;close to 100-man-years to create&quot;. Bethesda tripled their staff and spent the first year developing &quot;The Elder Scrolls Construction Set&quot;. This allowed the game staff to easily balance the game and to modify it in small increments rather than large. Ted Peterson, who had left following the release of &quot;Daggerfall&quot;, returned to work as an author of in-game material, and as a general consultant on the lore-based aspects of the work. The PC version of &quot;Morrowind&quot; had gone gold by April 23, 2002, and was released on May 1 in North America, with the Xbox release set at June 7. On January 3, Bethesda announced that game publisher Ubisoft would take control of &quot;Morrowind&quot; European distribution, in addition to those of eight other Bethesda games.

The expansion pack &quot;The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal&quot; went gold on November 1 and was released, with little fanfare, on November 6. &quot;Tribunal&quot; puts the player in the self-contained, walled city of Mournhold, which can be teleported to and from Morrowind&#x27;s land mass. Development on the expansion began after &quot;Morrowind&quot; shipped, giving the developers a mere five-month development cycle to release the game. The prior existence of the &quot;Construction Set&quot;, however, meant that the team &quot;already had the tools in place to add content and features very quickly&quot;. Interface improvements, and specifically an overhaul of &quot;Morrowind&quot; journal system, were among the key goals. &quot;Morrowind&quot; second expansion, &quot;The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon&quot;, went gold by May 23, and was released on June 6. It had been worked on since the release of &quot;Tribunal&quot;. In the expansion, the player travels to the frozen island of Solstheim and is asked to investigate the uneasiness of the soldiers stationed there.

=== &quot;Oblivion&quot; ===
Work on &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot; began in 2002, after &quot;Morrowind&quot; publication. &quot;Oblivion&quot; was developed by Bethesda Softworks, and the initial Xbox 360 and PC releases were co-published by Bethesda and Take-Two Interactive subsidiary 2K Games. &quot;Oblivion&quot; was released on March 21, 2006. The game centers around an event referred to as &quot;The Oblivion Crisis&quot;, where portals to the planes of Oblivion open and release hordes of Daedra upon Tamriel. Developers working on &quot;Oblivion&quot; focused on providing a tighter storyline, more developed characters, and to make information in the game world more accessible to players. &quot;Oblivion&quot; features improved AI, improved physics, and improved graphics. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the creation of &quot;Oblivion&quot; terrain, leading to landscapes that are more complex and realistic than those of past titles, but had less of a drain on Bethesda&#x27;s staff. Two downloadable expansion packs, &quot;Knights of the Nine&quot; and &quot;Shivering Isles&quot; were released in 2006 and 2007, respectively. &quot;Knights of the Nine&quot; added a questline surrounding the search for a set of Crusader relics, while &quot;Shivering Isles&quot; added the eponymous plane to the game.

=== &quot;Skyrim&quot; ===
In August 2010, Todd Howard revealed Bethesda was working on a game that had been in development since the release of &quot;Oblivion&quot;, and that progress was very far along. While the game was conceptualized after &quot;Oblivion&quot;″s release, main development was restricted until after &quot;Fallout 3&quot; was released. In November, Kristian West, then the editor-in-chief of Eurogamer&#x27;s Danish outlet, reported overhearing a developer on a plane talking about the project; a new &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; game, although Bethesda did not comment on the report. At the Spike Video Game Awards in December, Howard appeared on stage to unveil a teaser trailer and announce the title of the game. &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot; was released on November 11, 2011, to widespread critical acclaim. It was awarded &#x27;Game of the Year&#x27; by IGN, Spike and others. The game is set after the events of &quot;Oblivion&quot;, when the great dragon Alduin the World Eater returns to Skyrim; a beast whose existence threatens all life in Tamriel. The setting is heavily based on Scandinavia, as seen in the climate and creatures the character encounters. Three pieces of add-ons were released on PC and Xbox 360 in 2012 – &quot;Dawnguard&quot;, &quot;Hearthfire&quot; and &quot;Dragonborn&quot;, with a PlayStation 3 release in February 2013. &quot;Dawnguard&quot; added two joinable factions and an associated questline revolving around Vampires and the Dawnguard, a group of vampire hunters, while &quot;Hearthfire&quot; added more home customisation options including a house creation kit and the ability to adopt children. &quot;Dragonborn&quot; added the island of Solstheim to the northeast. On October 28, 2016, &quot;Skyrim – Special Edition&quot; was released. In 2016, on the fifth anniversary of &quot;Skyrim&quot;″s release, Zen Studios developed and released a virtual pinball adaptation of the game as part of the &quot;Bethesda Pinball&quot; collection, which became available as part of &quot;Zen Pinball 2&quot;, &quot;Pinball FX 2&quot; and &quot;Pinball FX 3&quot;, as well as a separate free-to-play app for iOS and Android mobile devices. On November 17, 2017, &quot;Skyrim VR&quot; was released for PlayStation 4. On June 10, 2018, &quot;Skyrim: Very Special Edition&quot;, a voice-activated text adventure game poking fun at the game&#x27;s many releases, was released for Amazon Alexa devices. The player character, Dragonborn, is a downloadable Mii fighter costume in the Nintendo crossover fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;.

=== &quot;The Elder Scrolls Online&quot; and &quot;Legends&quot; ===
On May 3, 2012, &quot;The Elder Scrolls Online&quot; was revealed. &quot;The Elder Scrolls Online&quot; was released for Windows and macOS on April 4, 2014, with the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions initially slated to follow in June 2014 but later delayed until June 9, 2015. The game originally required a subscription to play, but this requirement was dropped on March 17, 2015. There is however a subscription service entitled &quot;ESO Plus&quot; which grants access to all current and future downloadable content (DLC). The DLC is otherwise available for individual purchase in the Crown Store. Additionally, the optional subscription grants various perks that allow players to progress slightly faster than a free player, and grants them a payment of 1650 crowns per month. On June 14, 2015, &quot;The Elder Scrolls: Legends&quot;, a collectible card game, was announced by Bethesda during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015. It was released on March 9, 2017, for Microsoft Windows and is in beta for Android, iOS, and macOS.

=== &quot;Blades&quot; and &quot;Castles&quot; ===

At Bethesda&#x27;s E3 2018 press conference, Todd Howard announced &quot;The Elder Scrolls: Blades&quot;, originally planned for release in Q3 2018, and it was originally expected to be released for Apple and Android phones first, followed by PC and console, including VR. The player is able to play as a member of the faction called the Blades, who has returned home to their town to find it destroyed. There are survival, arena, and town-building modes, with multiplayer support through its arena and town-building mode, as well as cross-platform. The game is also able to be played in portrait mode, unusual for a role-playing game. The early access of &quot;Blades&quot; began March 27, 2019 for those who pre-ordered the game. &quot;Blades&quot; was expected to be fully released some time in early 2019, before being released for Android, iOS and Nintendo Switch in May 2020. &quot;&quot;, a mobile spin-off game similar to &quot;Fallout Shelter&quot;, was released for Android on September 28, 2023.

===&quot;The Elder Scrolls VI&quot;===

&quot;Elder Scrolls VI&quot; was first announced as being in pre-production during E3 2018, along with &quot;Starfield&quot;. Phil Spencer said that &quot;The&quot; &quot;Elder Scrolls VI&quot; would be coming out after Playground Games&#x27; &quot;Fable&quot; title.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; games are action role-playing games and include elements taken from action and adventure games. In &quot;Arena&quot;, players advance by killing monsters (and thereby gaining experience points) until a preset value is met, whereupon they level-up. However, in &quot;Daggerfall&quot;, &quot;Morrowind&quot;, and &quot;Oblivion&quot;, the series took a skill-based approach to character advancement. Players develop their characters&#x27; skills by applying them and only level-up when a certain set of skills have been developed. &quot;Skyrim&quot; took a new approach, where the more a skill is leveled, the more it helps to level the character. This shifted the focus away from character creation and more onto character development. The flexibility of the games&#x27; engines has facilitated the release of game extensions (or mods) through &quot;The Elder Scrolls Construction Set&quot;.

&quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; main series of games emphasizes different aspects of the gaming experience than most role-playing games. A brief article by Joystiq in early November 2006 compared BioWare&#x27;s creations to Bethesda&#x27;s by noting a difference in emphasis. Bethesda&#x27;s creations focused on &quot;aesthetic presentation and open-ended adventuring&quot;; BioWare&#x27;s on a combat system and modular architecture. This overarching aim has been noted by their designers as well. Bethesda has described their motivations in creating the first series game, &quot;Arena&quot;, as those of any good pen-and-paper role-playing games: creating an environment in which the player could be what the player wants and do what the player wants. &quot;Daggerfall&quot; manual begins with a design manifesto, declaring the developers&#x27; intention to &quot;create a book with blank pages&quot; and &quot;a game designed to encourage exploration and reward curiosity&quot;. Choices, in the form of paths taken by the player, to do good, to chase after evil, are left open to the player, &quot;just like in real life&quot;. This design trend continued with &quot;Morrowind&quot;, following the hiatus of similarly epic games in the interim, though Joystiq&#x27;s previously noted insistence on graphics came again to the fore. During the development of &quot;Morrowind&quot;, Bethesda tripled its staff, so as to perfectly color its newly hand-made world. In their own words, &quot;We knew we had to exceed the visual polish of the other games on the market, and we made it our goal to put &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; back into the forefront of game innovation.&quot;

== Series overview ==

=== Setting ===

&quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; takes place in a high fantasy world with influences from real world cultures. Like most works of high fantasy, &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; games are typically serious in tone and epic in scope, dealing with themes of a grand struggle against a supernatural or evil force. Many races exist in the world of &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot;, some typical of high fantasy works, such as humans, orcs and elves; some atypical, such as the lizard-like Argonians and cat-like Khajiit; and some subversions, such as the extinct Dwemer, known colloquially as &quot;dwarves&quot;, who follow the high fantasy stereotype of being subterranean, skilled metallurgists and masons, but are actually classified as a variety of elf who are highly technologically advanced. As is also typical in high fantasy works, magic and sorcery, mythical creatures, factions with their own political agendas, walled medieval cities and strongholds, and plot elements driven by prophecies and legends are common.

&quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; is known for its attention to detail, including extensive lore, scenery and back story. There is no omniscient narrator. Instead, the lore is presented in-universe, as written by the fictional scholars who inhabit the world, and it is subject to their biases and speculation. Players are encouraged to form their own interpretations of the lore and have developed extensive fan works. The developers avoid invalidating or overruling fan theories through canon. Internal inconsistencies are explained as errors in scholarship. Some inconsistencies, such as incorporating mutually exclusive endings to earlier games, are intentionally introduced and explained as magical paradoxes. Other elements of the lore are intentionally contradictory or made ambiguous to allow players to decide for themselves what is true. Players can, for example, deny being a prophesied hero or accept the role.

The first game in the series, &quot;Arena&quot;, featured little in the way of lore and lacked many elements that would come to define the series. An elaborate system of gods and myths were introduced in the second game, &quot;Daggerfall&quot;. The lore&#x27;s complexity came from a desire to improve on the writing in &quot;Arena&quot;, which had been criticized as lackluster.

After &quot;Daggerfall&quot;, the designers focused on further expanding the lore once they realized they still did not know much about the world&#x27;s fictional history or religions. The series&#x27; fictional cosmology is inspired by Gnosticism. There are contradictory creation myths, one of which claims that some of the gods were tricked into creating the mortal world, surrendering a portion of their power. These became the Nine Divines (also known as Aedra), who are worshipped as benevolent deities. A separate pantheon of more demonic deities known as the Daedra retain their full power and reside in Oblivion, a separate dimension. Individual Daedra are not necessarily evil, though they are often depicted as lacking empathy.

&quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; games primarily take place on the continent of Tamriel, located on the planet of Nirn. The exceptions are &quot;An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire&quot;, which is set in a different dimension; portions of &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot; and the entirety of its expansion, &quot;Shivering Isles&quot;, which take place in Oblivion; quests in Oblivion during the &quot;Dawnguard&quot; and &quot;Dragonborn&quot; add-ons of &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;; and further quests in Oblivion from &quot;The Elder Scrolls Online&quot;. Other continents exist on Nirn aside from Tamriel, such as Akavir, Pyandonea, Yokuda, and Atmora, but the people of Tamriel have little to no contact with these other continents and therefore do not possess much verifiable knowledge about them.

Tamriel comprises nine provinces, each of which is dominated by a distinct race: Black Marsh is home to the Argonians; Cyrodiil is home to the Imperials; Elsweyr is home to the Khajiit; Hammerfell is home to the Redguards; High Rock is home to the Bretons; Morrowind is home to the Dunmer, or Dark Elves; Skyrim is home to the Nords; Summerset Isle is home to the Altmer, or High Elves; and Valenwood is home to the Bosmer, or Wood Elves. A tenth race, the Orsimer, or Orcs, reside in settlements scattered across Tamriel and, at some points in history, a kingdom inside High Rock known as Orsinium.

Although various empires have controlled Tamriel over its several thousand years of recorded history, most games in the series have taken place during the Third Cyrodiilic Empire, which initially unites the entire continent under the reign of the Septim dynasty. In &quot;Arena&quot;, players are tasked with freeing the Emperor Uriel Septim VII from a magical prison engineered by his court wizard, who has usurped the throne and magically disguised himself as the Emperor. In &quot;Daggerfall&quot;, Uriel VII tasks the player with finding a powerful artifact. The player can give it to any of several factions, which will use it to reshape the regional power structure. In &quot;Morrowind&quot;, the player is prophesied to be the reincarnation of a great elven hero. Taking advantage of this, the Empire tasks the player with stabilizing the province of Morrowind by putting down a rebellion by a would-be god. In &quot;Oblivion&quot;, a religious cult opens a dimensional gate to a Hell-like realm and throws the Empire into chaos by killing Uriel VII and all of his known heirs. Although the player assists an illegitimate royal heir in closing the dimensional gate, the heir&#x27;s heroic sacrifice brings an abrupt end to the Septim bloodline, causing a succession crisis that devastates the Empire and reduces it to a rump state. In &quot;Skyrim&quot;, the Empire (now ruled by the Mede dynasty) is recovering from a horrific war against an elven separatist ethnostate the Aldmeri Dominion which covers most of southwest Tamriel, and whose terms of surrender have weakened the Empire even further and ultimately led to an ongoing civil war in the province of Skyrim. Amid these mounting tensions, Tamriel has to face the return of a legendary dragon known as &quot;the World-Eater&quot;, long after dragons were thought to have gone extinct.

&quot;The Elder Scrolls Online&quot; serves as a prequel to the Third Empire storyline, taking place in the middle of a 600-year interregnum between the Second and Third Cyrodiilic Empires. The initial game follows the player, who has been sacrificed by followers of the Daedric prince Molag Bal, as they manage to return to the mortal plane with the help of a former Emperor masquerading as a prophet. The player must join one of the three different military alliances that are vying for control of Tamriel in the Three Banners War, but is ultimately tasked with uniting all three factions against Molag Bal&#x27;s attempt to assimilate the entirety of the planet Nirn into his realm of Coldharbour.

The Elder Scrolls themselves play a very limited role in the storyline of the series, usually only as a framing plot device (i.e. &quot;[the events in this game] were foretold in the Elder Scrolls...&quot;). The Elder Scrolls are rarely referenced in the games. &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot; marks the first appearance of the Scrolls in the final quest of the Thieves Guild quest-line. The Scroll appears as an incomprehensible chart containing luminous glyphs. &quot;Oblivion&quot; further introduces monks who dedicate their lives to the study of the scrolls. In &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;, the Scrolls are integrated into the series&#x27; creation myth and are portrayed as potentially causing insanity when deciphered. The Scrolls are used in the main quest to travel back in time and learn how to defeat the antagonist, an immortal dragon. &quot;Skyrim&quot;″s &quot;Dawnguard&quot; expansion adds a quest to acquire the Scrolls to either assist or stop a vampire from blotting out the sun.

=== Future ===
At E3 2016, Bethesda Game Studios director Todd Howard reported that the studio was already working on a sixth installment in &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; franchise, although it would still be &quot;a very long way off&quot; and at E3 2017, Bethesda Softworks vice president of public relations stated that no new title was in active development, and that they have &quot;at least two major titles&quot; to complete before this would change. In an interview in June 2023, Todd Howard stated that The Elder Scrolls VI will come after Starfield, and it may be the last Elder Scrolls he makes.

At E3 2018, Howard presented a short teaser trailer for &quot;The Elder Scrolls VI&quot; and announced that it would be released following &quot;Starfield&quot;.

== Other media ==

In 2009, science-fiction author Gregory Keyes released &quot;The Infernal City&quot;, a novel set approximately 40 years after the Oblivion Crisis. &quot;Lord of Souls&quot; was released in 2011 as Keyes&#x27;s second novel in his &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; book series.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
In 2012, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; at number 20 on the list of the best video game franchises. In 2013, &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; was voted as the Greatest Game Series of the Decade on GameSpot, beating out 64 other competitors. &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; reached the final round, beating the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series by a margin of 52.5% of the vote for &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; to 47.5% for &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;.

=== Controversies ===

The fourth main game of the series, &quot;Oblivion&quot;, was initially released with a Teen rating by the ESRB, but after reports that its developers failed to disclose content that would not be encountered through normal gameplay but would be inconsistent with that rating, the ESRB took a second look at &quot;Oblivion&quot; that took the obscured content into consideration and in an unprecedented move that drew large public attention, raised the game&#x27;s rating to Mature.

In August 2011, Bethesda Softworks contacted the developer of &quot;Minecraft&quot;, Mojang, claiming that the intended trademark of the title &quot;Scrolls&quot; for its new game breached Bethesda&#x27;s trademark on &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot;. On March 10, 2012, Markus Persson tweeted that the two had come to an agreement over the use of the name. The agreement prohibits Mojang from using the title &quot;Scrolls&quot; in any future sequels of the game.

In May 2019, Bethesda Softworks released a promotional free tabletop role-playing game titled &quot;Elsweyr&quot;. It was accused of being plagiarized as it shared a very similar plot to the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventure &quot;The Black Road&quot;, written by Paige Leitman and Ben Heisler, and contains reworded text that substitutes some words for synonyms. After Leitman posted about the similarities on Facebook, the game was removed from their &quot;The Elder Scrolls Online&quot; Facebook page.

<doc id="325148" wikidata="Q5365718" url="?curid=325148" title="Ken Griffey Sr.">
<text>George Kenneth Griffey Sr. (born April 10, 1950) is an American former professional baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from through , most notably as a member of the Cincinnati Reds team that won three division titles and two World Series championships between and . He also played for the New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves, and Seattle Mariners.

A three-time All-Star, Griffey hit over .300 in five seasons for the powerful Cincinnati batting order that was known as the Big Red Machine for their dominance of the National League in the mid-1970s. In 2004, Griffey was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. He is the father of Hall of Fame outfielder Ken Griffey Jr.; the two were teammates on the Mariners for 51 games between 1990 and 1991.

==Early life==
Griffey was raised by a single mother of six; his father Buddy—a high school teammate of another Hall of Fame outfielder, Stan Musial—left the family when Griffey was two years old. In a 2016 interview with ESPN, he said he did not see his father again until he was 16. His contemporaries in his hometown of Donora, Pennsylvania, did not think he would become a baseball star; they considered his best sport to be football, where he was a star wide receiver. Griffey himself considered football to be his best sport, followed by basketball, track, and only then baseball. At times, he even competed in track meets during baseball games, rushing up the hill between Donora High School&#x27;s baseball field and track between at-bats when it came time for his track events.

However, as his high school graduation in 1969 neared, he discovered his girlfriend was pregnant. He was soon chosen by the Cincinnati Reds in the 29th round (682nd overall) of the 1969 Major League Baseball draft, signed with the organization, and married his girlfriend. After his first minor-league season, Ken Jr. was born. Though Griffey left Donora in 1972 as his professional career advanced, he retained close ties to the town.

==MLB career==

Griffey made his MLB debut with the Reds on August 25, 1973, finishing 2-for-4 in a 6–4 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. That season, Griffey played in only 25 games, but batted .384 with three home runs and 14 RBI. The following season, Griffey saw more playing time with 88 games, and hit .251 with two home runs and 19 RBI. In 1975, Griffey began to break out with a .305 batting average with four home runs and 46 RBI in 132 games.

Griffey&#x27;s best season came in 1976, when he came just short of winning the batting title behind Bill Madlock of the Chicago Cubs. Griffey chose to sit out the final day of the season to protect his batting title, but it came back to haunt him as Madlock collected four hits that same day. Griffey entered the game late after hearing the news, and went 0-for-2. Many baseball purists were disappointed in Griffey (and perhaps more so in his manager, Sparky Anderson, for choosing to sit him out to gain an individual accolade). Griffey finished with a career-high .336 average, six home runs, and 74 RBI in 148 games. He also finished with a career-high 34 stolen bases. After the season, he finished eighth in NL Most Valuable Player voting, and was named to the &quot;Sporting News&quot; National League All-Star team. The Reds won their second consecutive World Series title in 1976, but that year also marked the beginning of the end of their &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; phase. In the next four seasons, Griffey batted .318, .288, .316, and .294 with a total of 43 home runs. In Griffey&#x27;s final season of his first stint with the Reds, the strike-shortened 1981 campaign, he batted .311 with only two home runs and 34 RBI in 101 games.

On November 4, 1981, the Reds traded Griffey to the New York Yankees for Fred Toliver and Brian Ryder. He played for the Yankees from 1982 to 1986 at first base and outfield. Injuries often plagued Griffey, who hit .306 with 11 homers and 46 RBI in 1983, his best season with the Yankees. Tommy John thought Griffey was a better player on Astroturf fields (like Riverfront Stadium) than natural grass fields (like Yankee Stadium). An incident during his tenure, where he was told to take his son off the field, while white teammate Graig Nettles&#x27; son was allowed to stay, resulted in Griffey&#x27;s son refusing to ever sign with the Yankees.

On June 30, 1986, Griffey was traded to the Atlanta Braves alongside Andre Robertson in exchange for Claudell Washington and Paul Zuvella. Griffey played only one full season with the Braves in 1987, batting .286 with 14 home runs and 64 RBI in 122 games. However, he struggled to begin the 1988 season, batting .249 with two home runs and 19 RBI in 69 games. On July 28, Griffey was released by the Braves.

Five days after his release from the Braves, Griffey signed a contract to return to the Reds on August 2. He batted .280 with two home runs and 4 RBI in 25 games with the Reds to finish the season. He spent the 1989 season with the Reds, and was then released in the middle of the Reds&#x27; championship 1990 season. Griffey then signed with the Seattle Mariners to conclude the season, joining his son, Ken Jr. By becoming teammates with his son, they became the first father and son to be teammates in Major League Baseball. Although he played in only 21 games to finish the season, Griffey excelled, batting .377 with three home runs and 18 RBI. On December 17, 1990, he returned to the Mariners on a one-year deal for the 1991 season.

Griffey played in his final major league game on May 31, 1991 against the Texas Rangers. In November 1991, Griffey chose to retire after 19 seasons due to a neck injury. In 1,997 games, Griffey compiled a lifetime batting average of .296, with 152 home runs and 859 RBI. Griffey was also the Most Valuable Player of the 1980 All-Star Game. In 2014, Griffey published his memoir &quot;Big Red: Baseball, Fatherhood, and My Life in the Big Red Machine&quot;, in which he discussed his childhood, formative years, professional career with both the Reds and the Yankees, and his relationships with friends and family.

==Post-playing career==
Griffey was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2010, Griffey was hired as the batting coach for the Dayton Dragons, the Reds&#x27; Single-A minor league affiliate. In 2011, he was named manager of the Bakersfield Blaze, the Reds&#x27; Single-A affiliate of the California League. In 2014, Griffey was replaced by Pat Kelly. Griffey remained in the organization as a roving instructor, focusing on hitting and bunting.

==The Griffey family==
Ken&#x27;s father, Joseph &quot;Buddy&quot; Griffey, was a local athlete who was a teammate of Stan Musial on the Donora High School baseball team. 

The Griffeys (Ken Sr. and Ken Jr.) became the first father-and-son tandem to play on the same Major League Baseball team at the same time. They played their first game together for the Seattle Mariners on August 31, 1990 against the Kansas City Royals. On September 14, 1990, father and son hit back-to-back home runs in a game against the California Angels; this is the only time in major league history that this has happened. Griffey&#x27;s younger son Craig played in the Mariners&#x27; minor league system and appeared with his brother in the outfield during some Cactus League games. Craig Griffey retired from baseball after failing to make it past Triple-A, where he appeared in a handful of games with the Tacoma Rainiers.

Griffey&#x27;s grandson Trey Griffey went undrafted in the 2017 NFL draft and spent time with the Indianapolis Colts, Miami Dolphins, and Pittsburgh Steelers.

<text>Role-playing game creation software is a game creation system (software program) intended to make it easy for non-programmers to create a role-playing video game. The target audience for most of these products is artists and creative types who have the imaginative abilities to assemble the elements of a game (artwork, plotline, music, etc.) but lack the technical skill to program it themselves.

==RPG Maker==
The most famous RPG maker is the commercial Japanese RPG Maker series that has been released since 1988 for many systems ranging from the PC-8801, MSX, PC-9801, and Microsoft Windows, to the Super Famicom, PlayStation, Game Boy Color, PlayStation 2, and Cellphones.

==Other role-playing game creation software==
While not an RPG maker per se, the Worldforge game engine is intended for creating MMORPGs.

<text>The Five Tiger Generals is a popular appellation in Chinese culture for the top five military commanders serving under one lord. Although the term does not appear in Chinese historical records and is not used officially, it has been heavily used in literature texts, folklore, as well as popular culture.

==Three Kingdoms==

=== &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; ===
As a romanticized novel based on the history of the Three Kingdoms period, the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; refers to Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Huang Zhong, Ma Chao and Zhao Yun as the &quot;Five Tiger Generals&quot; of Shu Han, one of the Three Kingdoms, led by warlord Liu Bei. In the literature, Liu Bei initially appointed Guan Yu as General Who Destroys Rebels and Lord of Hanshou, Zhang Fei as General Who Subdues Rebels and Lord of Xin, Huang Zhong as General Who Conquers the West, Ma Chao as General Who Pacifies the West, and Zhao Yun General Who Guards the West, and promoted them to &quot;Five Tiger Generals&quot; later.

==== Guan Yu ====
Guan Yu is one of Liu Bei&#x27;s strongest generals in the novel. Together with Zhang Fei, he started following Liu Bei&#x27;s leadership at a very early stage of Liu Bei&#x27;s career, at which time the Han dynasty was experiencing the large-scale Yellow Turban Rebellion. He joined a militia that was led by Liu Bei, funded by local business groups in Zhuo County. He impressed Liu Bei at their first meet-up due to his physical strength and outgoing personality, and quickly formed a brotherly relationship with Liu Bei and Zhang Fei. He rose from fighting Yellow Turbans, commanded Liu Bei&#x27;s navy, conquered Changsha, governed Jing Province, expanded Shu Han&#x27;s territory to Cao Wei-controlled Fancheng. Throughout his career, Guan Yu participated numerous battles against Cao Wei led by Cao Cao and Eastern Wu led by Sun Quan, and played a critical role in establishment of Shu Han. Due to the might of his arm and his chivalry, Guan Yu is divinized after his death, representing bravery, power, loyalty, righteousness, as well as brotherhood.

==== Zhang Fei ====
Zhang Fei is one of Liu Bei&#x27;s strongest generals in the novel. Together with Guan Yu, he started following Liu Bei&#x27;s leadership at a very early stage of Liu Bei&#x27;s career, at which time Empire Han was experiencing the Yellow Turban Rebellion. He joined a militia that was led by Liu Bei, funded by local business groups in Zhuo County. He impressed Liu Bei at their first meet-up due to his physical strength and outgoing personality, and quickly formed a brotherly relationship with Liu Bei and Guan Yu. He rose from fighting rebels in Yellow Turban Rebellion, conquered Ba Commandery, captured multiple cities cross in the area around present-day Sichuan and Chongqing, built a solid foundation for Liu Bei&#x27;s establishment of Shu Han.

==== Huang Zhong ====
Prior to joining Liu Bei&#x27;s force, Huang Zhong served under Han Xuan in the novel as an Associate General in Changsha. When Liu Bei delegated Guan Yu to conquer Changsha, Han Xuan somehow suspected that Huang Zhong was persuaded by Guan Yu to be a traitor despite Huang Zhong&#x27;s fighting on the battlefield against Guan Yu, and arrested him for execution. Huang Zhong&#x27;s fellow military comrades organized a revolution to save his life, killed Han Xuan, and surrendered to Guan Yu. After joining Shu Han, Huang Zhong defeated Xiahou Yuan of Cao Wei in the Battle of Mount Dingjun, and thus secured Shu Han&#x27;s northern border. 

==== Ma Chao ====
Ma Chao rose to fame when he led his father Ma Teng&#x27;s army to fight barbarians in Liang Province. He was nicknamed &quot;Ma Chao the Splendid&quot; for his magnificent armor and grand skill as a warrior. In the novel, shortly after his family was murdered by Cao Cao, Ma Chao and his cousin Ma Dai joined Zhang Lu&#x27;s force to revenge Cao Cao, and then joined Liu Bei&#x27;s force following Zhang Lu&#x27;s surrender to Cao Cao. As Ma Chao had established an extraordinary military achievements when he fought Qiang barbarians since his early years, he continued to be Liu Bei&#x27;s mightiest general that protected Shu Han&#x27;s northwestern border from Qiang barbarians.

==== Zhao Yun ====
Zhao Yun, also known as Zhao Zilong, fought together with Liu Bei as an ally during Liu Bei&#x27;s early career, leaving a very close relationship with each other in the novel. Finally when Zhao Yun and Liu Bei met in Ye, Zhao Yun decided that he would follow Liu Bei&#x27;s leadership for the rest of his life. During his career with Liu Bei&#x27;s force, Zhao Yun protected Liu Bei&#x27;s family, and saved Shu Han&#x27;s crown prince Liu Shan from numerous battles. Zhao Yun&#x27;s most legendary battle was to save Liu Shan, who was an infant at the time, from Cao Cao&#x27;s encirclement. During the Battle of Changban, isolated by Cao Cao&#x27;s army, Zhao Yun held Liu Shan in his armor, slew more than 70 enemy warriors alone, and escaped the scene without disturbing the infant&#x27;s sleep. In Shu Han, Zhao Yun led Liu Bei&#x27;s royal guards, ensured the safety of the royal family, and kept the capital city in peace.

=== Historicity ===
Historically, Liu Bei never assigned any title similar to the &quot;Five Tiger Generals&quot;, but instead did appoint them to titles of the same military ranking: Guan Yu as General of Front, Zhang Fei as General of Right, Huang Zhong as General of Rear, Ma Chao as General of Left, and Zhao Yun as General of Center. In the official historical text &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the historian Chen Shou grouped them into one volume due to their similar military titles. 

==== &quot;Five Tiger Generals&quot; grouping as validation of historical accomplishments ====
Some historians that study the history of the Three Kingdoms periods argue that while Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Huang Zhong, Ma Chao and Zhao Yun were appointed to the similar military rankings and were listed in the same volume in the historical texts, their military achievements are significantly differed, and people referring those five generals as &quot;Five Tiger Generals&quot; presume that they share the same accomplishments. Kaiyu Luo of Sichuan University argues that while Guan Yu had led armies of over 200,000 soldiers to expand Shu Han&#x27;s territory, Zhao Yun had never stepped out of Shu Han&#x27;s capital city in his military career: it does not make sense to presume Guan Yu and Zhao Yun had the same level of achievements or to group them together under one &quot;Five Tiger Generals&quot; ranking.

Researchers who support this grouping pointed out that Zhao Yun&#x27;s core responsibility was to ensure the safety of Shu Han&#x27;s central government, and historically this role could only be assigned to the most reliable commander. It is important to raise the awareness that protecting the kingdom is the same important as expanding territory, and it is reasonable for Chen Shou to list Zhao Yun in the same volume of Guan Yu, and for people to refer both Zhao Yun and Guan Yu as members of &quot;Five Tiger Generals&quot;.

== In &quot;Water Margin&quot; ==
In the classical novel &quot;Water Margin&quot;, five of the 108 outlaws at Liangshan Marsh – Guan Sheng, Lin Chong, Qin Ming, Huyan Zhuo and Dong Ping – are ranked as the &quot;Five Tiger Generals&quot; of the Liangshan cavalry. 

=== Guan Sheng ===
In the literature, Guan Sheng, nicknamed as Great Blade (大刀), first appears in Vol. 63. According to the literature, Guan Sheng is Guan Yu&#x27;s direct descendant, inheriting the same physical appearance of Guan Yu, and using the same weapon as Guan Yu used. Guan Sheng was initially appointed by Cai Jing to lead government force to attack Liangshan Marsh, but surrendered to Liangshan after defeated by Liangshan&#x27;s Huyan Zhuo. After he joined Liangshan, Guan Sheng captured Shan Tinggui and Wei Dingguo of the Song government force, and was ranked as #5 out of 108 outlaws. Guan Sheng&#x27;s official military title in Liangshan Marsh is &quot;General of the Left of the Five Tiger Generals of Cavalry&quot;.

== In other literature ==
In the historical novel &quot;&quot;, the rebellion force of Wagang Army has “Five Tiger Generals”: Qin Shubao, Shan Xiongxin, Cheng Yaojin, Wang Bodang and Luo Cheng.

The Qing dynasty writer Li Yutang named Di Qing, Shi Yu, Zhang Zhong, Li Yi, and Liu Qing as the &quot;Five Tiger Generals&quot; in his works &quot;Romance of Di Qing&quot;, &quot;The Five Tigers Conquer the West&quot;, and &quot;The Five Tigers Pacify the South&quot;.

In &quot;Heroes of the Ming Dynasty&quot;, a novel romanticising the events leading to the founding of the Ming dynasty, Xu Da, Tang He, Chang Yuchun, Hu Dahai, and Mu Ying are named the &quot;Five Founding Tiger Generals of Ming&quot;.

==Cultural impact==
In present-day terminology, &quot;Five Tiger Generals&quot; can refer to any group of five that is particularly outstanding in a certain field.

<doc id="325156" wikidata="Q958148" url="?curid=325156" title="Mezzanine">
<text>A mezzanine (; or in Italian, a mezzanino) is an intermediate floor in a building which is partly open to the double-height ceilinged floor below, or which does not extend over the whole floorspace of the building, a loft with non-sloped walls. However, the term is often used loosely for the floor above the ground floor, especially where a very high-ceilinged original ground floor has been split horizontally into two floors.

Mezzanines may serve a wide variety of functions. Industrial mezzanines, such as those used in warehouses, may be temporary or semi-permanent structures.

In Royal Italian architecture, &quot;mezzanino&quot; also means a chamber created by partitioning that does not go up all the way to the arch vaulting or ceiling; these were historically common in Italy and France, for example in the palaces for the nobility at the Quirinal Palace.

==Definition==
A mezzanine is an intermediate floor (or floors) in a building which is open to the floor below. It is placed halfway (&quot;mezzo&quot; means &#x27;half&#x27; in Italian) up the wall on a floor which has a ceiling at least twice as high as a floor with minimum height. A mezzanine does not count as one of the floors in a building, and generally does not count in determining maximum floorspace. The International Building Code permits a mezzanine to have as much as one-third of the floor space of the floor below. Local building codes may vary somewhat from this standard. A space may have more than one mezzanine, as long as the sum total of floor space of all the mezzanines is not greater than one-third the floor space of the complete floor below.

Mezzanines help to make a high-ceilinged space feel more personal and less vast, and can create additional floor space. Mezzanines, however, may have lower-than-normal ceilings due to their location. The term &quot;mezzanine&quot; does not imply any particular function; mezzanines can be used for a wide array of purposes.

Mezzanines are commonly used in modern architecture, which places a heavy emphasis on light and space.

==Industrial mezzanines==
In industrial settings, mezzanines may be installed (rather than built as part of the structure) in high-ceilinged spaces such as warehouses. These semi-permanent structures are usually free-standing, can be dismantled and relocated, and are sold commercially. Industrial mezzanine structures can be supported by structural steel columns and elements, or by racks or shelves. Depending on the span and the run of the mezzanine, different materials may be used for the mezzanine&#x27;s deck like fibre cement boards. Some industrial mezzanines may also include enclosed, paneled office space on their upper levels. There are three basic types of industrial mezzanines: custom, standard or modular.

A structural engineer is sometimes hired to help determine whether the floor of the building can support a mezzanine (and how heavy the mezzanine may be), and to design the appropriate mezzanine.

===Custom mezzanines===
Custom Mezzanines are steel, raised industrial platform structures that are designed specifically to match the space and capacity needs of a given facility. It will, at a minimum, include a stairway for accessing the mezzanine. These structures typically are the strongest in terms of support capacity. 

===Standard mezzanines===
Standard Mezzanines are steel, raised industrial platform structures that are completely self-supporting and are sold in predetermined sizes and shapes. These off-the-shelf structures are usually strong (in terms of support capacity) and less expensive than custom mezzanines.

==Safety==
Employees in material handling and manufacturing are often at risk of falls when they are on the job. Recent figures show approximately 20,000 serious injuries and nearly 100 fatalities a year in industrial facilities. Falls of people and objects from mezzanines are of particular concern.

In many industrial operations, openings are cut into the guardrail on mezzanines and elevated work platforms to allow picking of palletized material to be loaded and unloaded, often with a fork truck, to upper levels. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and International Building Council (IBC) have published regulations for fall protection and The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has published standards for securing pallet drop areas to protect workers that work on elevated platforms and are exposed to openings.

In most cases, safety gates are used to secure these openings. OSHA requires openings 48 inches or taller to be secured with a fall protection system. Removable sections of railing or gates that swing or slide open would be used to open up the area and allow the transfer of material, and then close once the material is removed. However, current ANSI standards require dual-gate safety systems for fall protection.

Dual-gate safety systems were created to secure these areas, allowing a barrier to be in place at all times, even while pallets are being loaded or removed. Dual-gate systems create a completely enclosed workstation providing protection for the worker during loading and off-loading operations. When the rear-side gate opens, the ledge gate automatically closes, ensuring there is always a gate between the operator and the ledge.

<text>Madison Records was a United States-based record label. It was also sold in the United Kingdom through the F.W. Woolworth dime store chain. It was a subsidiary of Grey Gull Records, produced from 1926 through 1931 (almost a year after the last record on the Grey Gull label was issued). General opinion among the knowledgeable record collectors of this era is that Madison, being sold at Woolworth&#x27;s, survived for a while after Grey Gull and their other labels due to fulfilling the Woolworth contract.

Like Grey Gull, Madison records were often poorly recorded and made from the same cheap material. Much of Madison&#x27;s material duplicates other Grey Gull labels issues, but some material appeared only on Madison. Unlike the other Grey Gull subsidiaries, Madison Records labels and advertising made no reference to the parent company.

Issues include popular dance music and songs of the time, mostly recorded by studio musicians in New York City. There are a few jazz sides of interest, as well as some Hawaiian music and Wurlitzer organ solos on Madison records. Audio fidelity, is about average to somewhat below average for the era, pressed in below average quality shellac.

<text>, literally meaning &quot;concept of annihilation&quot; in German and generally taken to mean &quot;the concept of fast annihilation of enemy forces&quot;, is a tactical doctrine dating back to Frederick the Great. It emphasizes rapid, fluid movement to unbalance an enemy, allowing the attacker to impose its will upon the defender and to avoid stalemate. It relies on uncommonly rigorous training and discipline and thoroughly-professional leadership. Much of can be seen in Carl von Clausewitz&#x27;s classic treatise &quot;Vom Kriege&quot; (&quot;On War&quot;).

The doctrine was used in the War of Austrian Succession, the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Napoleonic Wars, the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War. The military success of the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire was the catalyst of the alliance systems of 19th-century Europe.

The arms races of the period produced the military equipment that eroded the attacker&#x27;s advantage during Europe&#x27;s &quot;Long Peace&quot;. It gave an advantage to the defender and set the stage for the stalemate of the First World War. was still viable on the 
Eastern Front, as was seen at the Battle of Tannenberg and others, but trench warfare dominated the Western Front, left little or no space to manoeuvre to the enemy&#x27;s flank or rear and made the idea difficult to achieve. The Germans developed infiltration tactics as a way of bringing the idea back, notably at the Battle of Caporetto and during Operation Michael.

During the 1930s, British Army officers such as Vivian Loyd proposed the widespread use of light tracked vehicles to provide speed and agility in support of tank units. Loyd&#x27;s theory, known as the &quot;armoured idea&quot; or &quot;all-tank idea&quot;, was not widely accepted by his superiors.

When World War II began, many German officers, including General Heinz Guderian, combined elements of infiltration tactics with tanks, which evolved into the methodology called &quot;Bewegungskrieg&quot; (literally: &quot;War of movement&quot;) and was later dubbed &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; by propagandists of both sides.

<doc id="325181" wikidata="Q249996" url="?curid=325181" title="Keelung">
<text>Keelung ( ; Chinese: 基隆; ; Hokkien: Ke-lâng), Chilung or Jilong ( ; ), officially known as Keelung City, is a major port city in northeastern Taiwan. The city is part of the Taipei–Keelung metropolitan area with neighboring New Taipei City and Taipei. Nicknamed the &quot;Rainy Port&quot; for its frequent rain and maritime role, the city is Taiwan&#x27;s second largest seaport (after Kaohsiung), and was the world&#x27;s 7th largest port in 1984.

In 1626, the Spanish established Fort San Salvador at present-day Keelung, an area inhabited by Taiwanese indigenous peoples. Control of the area eventually passed to the Qing dynasty. Fighting between China and Europeans around Keelung occurred in the 19th century during the First Opium War and the Sino-French War. The island of Taiwan was ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 after the First Sino-Japanese War; under Japanese rule the city was called Kirun. Keelung became part of Taiwan Province under the Republic of China after 1945. Administratively, the city became a first-level subdivision in 2018 after the provincial government was abolished.

== Name ==
According to early Chinese accounts, this northern coastal area was originally called &quot;Pak-kang&quot; (). By the early 20th century, the city was known to the Western world as Kelung, as well as the variants &quot;Kiloung&quot;, &quot;Kilang&quot; and &quot;Keelung&quot;. In his 1903 general history of Taiwan, US Consul to Formosa (1898–1904) James W. Davidson related that &quot;Kelung&quot; was among the few well-known names, thus warranting no alternate Japanese romanization.

However, the Taiwanese people have long called the city &quot;Kelang&quot; (). While it has been proposed that this name was derived from the local mountain that took the shape of a rooster cage, it is more likely that the name was derived from the first inhabitants of the region, as are the names of many other Taiwanese cities. In this case, the Ketagalan people were the first inhabitants, and early Han settlers probably approximated &quot;Ketagalan&quot; with &quot;Ke-lâng&quot; (Ketagalan: , &quot;domain marker prefix&quot; + Taiwanese Hokkien ), the noun root being replaced with the common Taiwanese Hokkien term for people, while the domain marker circumfix &quot;&quot; being reduced to just the prefix.

In 1875, during the late Qing era, a new official name was given (). In Mandarin, probably the working language of Chinese government at the time, both the old and new names were likely pronounced &quot;Gīlóng&quot; (hence &quot;Keelung&quot;).

Under Japanese rule (1895–1945), the city was also known to the west by the Japanese romanization Kīrun (also written as &quot;Kiirun&quot;).

In Taiwanese Hokkien, the native language of the area, the city is called &quot;Ke-lâng&quot;. In Hanyu Pinyin, a system created for Mandarin Chinese in Mainland China, the name of Keelung is written as &quot;Jīlóng&quot; (the shift from initial &quot;K&quot; to &quot;J&quot; is a recent development in the Beijing dialect, see Old Mandarin).

==History==

===Early history===

Keelung was first inhabited by the Ketagalan, a tribe of Taiwanese aborigine. The Spanish expedition to Formosa in the early 17th century was its first contact with the West; by 1624 the Spanish had built San Salvador de Quelung, a fort in Keelung serving as an outpost of the Manila-based Spanish East Indies. The Spanish ruled it as a part of Spanish Formosa. Besides the native Taiwanese aborigines, the Spanish authorities from Spanish Manila settled North Taiwan (especially Keelung and Tamsui) with a mixture of Sangley Chinese (primarily Fujianese traders), Christian Japanese, native Filipinos (e.g. Kapampangan, Tagalogs, etc.) as merchants and laborers, and some Mexican Mestizos, Mulattos, Blacks, Mexican Amerindians as soldiers and laborers and a few Spanish Filipinos from Spanish Philippines and rarely Mexican Criollo Spaniards from New Spain (Mexico) as Catholic friar missionaries and colonial leaders, with the Latin Americans from New Spain (Mexico) brought over to North Taiwan from Manila through the Manila-Acapulco Galleons. From 1642 to 1661 and 1663–1668, Keelung was under Dutch control. The Dutch East India Company took over the Spanish Fort San Salvador at Santissima Trinidad. They reduced its size and renamed it Fort Noort-Hollant. The Dutch had three more minor fortifications in Keelung and also a little school and a preacher.

When Ming dynasty loyalist Koxinga successfully attacked the Dutch in southern Taiwan 
(Siege of Fort Zeelandia), the crew of the Keelung forts fled to the Dutch trading post in Japan. The Dutch came back in 1663 and re-occupied and strengthened their earlier forts. However, trade with Qing China through Keelung was not what they hoped it would be and, in 1668, they left after getting harassed by aboriginals.

===Qing dynasty===
====First Opium War====
During the First Opium War, the British merchant ship &quot;Nerbudda&quot; shipwrecked near the port of Keelung due to a typhoon in September 1841. Several months later, another British merchantman, the brig &quot;Ann&quot;, also shipwrecked near Keelung on March 1842. Hundreds of survivors from both ships were captured by Chinese authorities and transferred to Taiwan. Two senior Chinese officials, Dahonga and Yao Ying, filed a false report to the Daoguang Emperor, claiming to have beaten off a British attack against Keelung. In October 1841, the Royal Navy sloop HMS &quot;Nimrod&quot; sailed to Keelung to search for survivors of &quot;Nerbudda&quot;, but after they found out the Chinese sent them south for imprisonment, &quot;Nimrod&quot; bombarded the city&#x27;s port, destroying 27 cannon before returning to British Hong Kong. Most of the survivors—over 130 from the &quot;Nerbudda&quot; and 54 from the &quot;Ann&quot;—were summarily executed by the Chinese in August 1842.

In 1863, the Qing Empire opened up Keelung as a trading port and the city enjoyed rapid development due to the abundant commodities such as placer gold and high quality coal found in the drainage area of Keelung River. In 1875, Taipeh Prefecture was created and included Keelung. In 1878, Keelung was formed into a &quot;ting&quot; or sub-prefecture. Around the same time, the name was changed from &quot;Ke-lang&quot; () to &quot;Kilong&quot; (), which means &quot;rich and prosperous land&quot;.

The city suffered serious damage and lost hundreds of inhabitants during an earthquake and tsunami in 1867. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.0 and was caused by movement on a nearby fault.

====Sino-French War====
During the Sino-French War (1884–85), the French attempted an invasion of Taiwan during the Keelung Campaign. Liu Mingchuan, who led the defence of Taiwan, recruited Aboriginals to serve alongside the Chinese soldiers in fighting against the French of Colonel Jacques Duchesne&#x27;s Formosa Expeditionary Corps. The French were defeated at the Battle of Tamsui and the Qing forces pinned the French down at Keelung in an eight-month-long campaign before the French withdrew.

===Empire of Japan===
A systematic city development started during the Japanese Era, after the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki, which handed all Taiwan over to Japan. A five-phase construction of Keelung Harbor was initiated, and in by 1916 trade volume had exceeded even those of Tamsui and Kaohsiung Harbors to become one of the major commercial harbors of Taiwan.

Keelung was governed as , Kīrun District, Taihoku Prefecture in 1920 and was upgraded to a city in 1924. The Pacific War broke out in 1941, and Keelung became one of the first targets of Allied bombers and was nearly destroyed as a result.

===Republic of China===
After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in October 1945, Keelung was established as a provincial city of Taiwan Province. The Keelung City Government worked with the harbor bureau to rebuild the city and the harbor and by 1984, the harbor became the 7th largest container harbor in the world. The city became directly governed by the Executive Yuan after Taiwan Province was streamlined in 1998 and became a &quot;de facto&quot; first level division in 2018 following the dissolution of the Taiwan Provincial Government.

==Geography==
Keelung City is located in the northern part of Taiwan Island. It occupies an area of and is separated from its neighboring county by mountains in the east, west and south. The northern part of the city faces the ocean and is a great deep water harbor since early times. Keelung also administers the nearby Keelung Islet as well as the more distant and strategically important Pengjia Islet, Mianhua Islet and Huaping Islet.

===Climate===
Keelung has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) with a yearly rainfall average upwards of . It has long been noted as one of the wettest and gloomiest cities in the world; the effect is related to the Kuroshio Current. Although it is one of the coolest cities of Taiwan, winters are still short and warm, whilst summers are long, relatively dry and hot, temperatures can peek above 26 °C during a warm winter day, while it can dip below 27 °C during a rainy summer day, much like the rest of northern Taiwan. However its location on northern mountain slopes means that due to orographic lift, rainfall is heavier during fall and winter, the latter during which a northeasterly flow prevails. During summer, southwesterly winds dominate and thus there is a slight rain shadow effect. Fog is most serious during winter and spring, when relative humidity levels are also highest.

<text>Alexander Gordon Jump (April 1, 1932 – September 22, 2003) was an American actor best known for playing Arthur &quot;Big Guy&quot; Carlson in the series &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (1978–1982); he reprised the role in its spinoff &quot;The New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (1991–1993). He also played Chief Tinkler in the sitcom &quot;Soap&quot; (1977–1978) and Mr. Horton on a two-part episode of the sitcom &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; (1983). He appeared in Maytag commercials as the &quot;Maytag repairman&quot; from 1989 until he retired in 2003.

==Early life==
Born Alexander Gordon Jump, Jump was raised in Centerville, a suburb of Dayton, Ohio. He graduated from Centerville High School and enrolled in Otterbein College. After his first year, he transferred to Kansas State University studying broadcasting and communication; he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. He got his first television job with WIBW-TV in Topeka. He dabbled in &quot;writing, producing, and directing&quot; while at the station. Jump was the title character in WIBW&#x27;s &quot;WIB the Clown&quot;, an educational children&#x27;s program. He reported the weather on the channel and was not always able to get his clown makeup off in time.

In September 1961, he returned to Dayton and joined WLWD as the station&#x27;s director of special broadcast services. He continued as a producer and on-air personality at WLWD, hosting &quot;Gordon Jump″s Fun Time&quot;, a popular show for younger children, and &quot;High Time&quot;, a variety series, before moving to Los Angeles in 1963 to pursue acting. Later in his life, Jump converted and became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

==Career==
Jump&#x27;s acting career began when he was 32. Jump participated in a theatre production at the Glendale Centre Theatre in Glendale, California, where he was noticed and offered an agent. The theatre was owned by Nathan and Ruth Hale, who were members of the LDS Church. It was there that Jump first learned about the LDS Church.

Jump&#x27;s first break on television was his guest role as Marcus Clements in CBS&#x27;s Daniel Boone, where he had eight lines. During the 1960s, he landed minor roles in television on such shows as &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;Lancer&quot;, &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot;, and &quot;Green Acres&quot;.

In the 1960s, Jump converted to the LDS Church. He acted in several church-produced instructional and educational productions, including &quot;When Thou Art Converted&quot; (1967), &quot;Pioneers In Petticoats&quot; (1969), and &quot;What About Thad?&quot; (1970). In 1967, he played the role of Lehi in the Burbank pageant People of the Book&quot;.&quot; He appeared as Peter, the apostle, in a 1969 film which was used in some of the church&#x27;s temple ceremonies.&quot; &quot;He also acted in The Singles Ward in 2002, a LDS comedy series&quot;.&quot; He and Robert Starling, an independent filmmaker, began Associated Latter-day Media Artists&quot;.&quot;

Jump&#x27;s first recurring role came in 1977, as Chief of Police Tinkler in &quot;Soap&quot;. In 1978, he landed his signature role of Arthur &quot;Big Guy&quot; Carlson on the situation comedy &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, portraying a bumbling radio station manager. Jump stated that the character of Arthur Carlson was based on a real-world WQXI executive.

After &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; was cancelled in 1982, Jump made appearances on many other shows. These appearances include &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Night Court&quot;, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, and &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;. He had a recurring role as Maggie Seaver&#x27;s father on &quot;Growing Pains&quot;.

On a two part episode of &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, titled &quot;The Bicycle Man&quot;. He played Mr. Horton, the owner of a bicycle shop who attempts to molest series protagonist Arnold Jackson and his friend, Dudley. While his &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; obituary called this role a &quot;daring career turn&quot;, Genevieve Koski at the &quot;AV Club&quot;&#x27;s roundtable found the laugh track that played during the scene in which the boys see nude photographs &quot;horrifying&quot;. Koski&#x27;s fellow roundtable member Donna Bowman disagreed, stating that the special humanized the situation.

In 1989, Jump took over the Maytag repairman role from Jesse White. In the 1990s, Jump starred in a short-lived revival of &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; entitled &quot;The New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;. He appeared in the ninth and final season of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, in which he played George Costanza&#x27;s boss at a playground equipment company over two episodes. His last movie role was in the 2004 film &quot;Changing of the Guard&quot;, released after his death.

== Inspiration and Spirituality ==
Jump believed the film and television industry to be &quot;the most powerful tool&quot; that can &quot;communicate&quot; and &quot;give... a positive outlook of life to many people.&quot; According to his personal religious faith, he also believed theatre and television had the ability to uplift and edify individuals and felt that God uses a similar medium to guide his children.

When scripts required Jump to act in ways that went against his religious convictions, he said that his acting required the same &quot;honesty and judiciousness&quot; as the rest of his life. He portrayed the fictional character as accurately as possible to deliver an honest representation of the story to his audience. He warned against portraying all theatrical characters like &quot;missionaries&quot;, and instead encouraged actors to &quot;stay true to their craft&quot;, through which their inner virtue would shine through. Additionally, Jump did not believe in censorship, claiming that &quot;if you teach people correct principles, they can govern themselves&quot;, which is a paraphrase of a teaching by Joseph Smith.&quot;&quot;

When Jump was offered the role of Chief Tinkler in &quot;Soap&quot;, he and the LDS Church bishop of his church were wary that the content of the program was contrary to his faith. Jump returned to the producers the next day with the intention of refusing the role. The directors heard his concerns and suggested that the underlying messages of the show were more aligned to his beliefs as a Latter-day Saint than he realized; he was encouraged to read the &quot;retribution scenes&quot; in the script. Impressed by the depth of the lessons told through humor, Jump took the role in &quot;Soap&quot; and recommended that viewers of faith evaluate the lessons taught by the finished artistic product of a film or show rather than evaluate whether an actor would actually do some of the things which they portray on screen.

==Death==
Jump died on September 22, 2003, from pulmonary fibrosis that led to respiratory failure at his home near Los Angeles. He is interred at the El Toro Memorial Park in Lake Forest, California.

<doc id="325187" wikidata="Q530220" url="?curid=325187" title="Frank Bruno">
<text>Franklin Roy Bruno (born 16 November 1961) is a British former professional boxer who competed from 1982 to 1996. He won the WBC heavyweight title from Oliver McCall at Wembley Stadium in 1995, in what was his fourth world championship challenge. Bruno faced multiple top-rated heavyweights throughout his career, including two defeats against Mike Tyson in 1989 and 1996, and a defeat against fellow Briton Lennox Lewis in 1993.

Bruno scored 38 knockouts in 40 wins, giving him a 95% knockout-to-win ratio; his overall knockout percentage was 84.44%. Bruno was ranked among BoxRec&#x27;s 10 best heavyweights in the world twelve times, reaching his career-high ranking of world no. 3 at the conclusion of 1984. In retirement Bruno remained a celebrity with the British public, and his mental health issues received much media attention.

== Professional career ==
Bruno became a professional boxer in 1981, achieving 21 consecutive wins by knockout. This streak caught the attention of international boxing magazines, such as &quot;The Ring&quot;, &quot;KO Magazine&quot;, &quot;Boxing Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Ring En Español&quot;. During this period Bruno stopped former world title contender Scott LeDoux, the fringe contender Floyd Cummings, Belgian champion Rudy Gauwe, British contenders Tony Moore and Eddie Nielson, and some strong journeymen such as Bill Sharkey, Walter Santemore and Ken Lakusta. However, in May 1984 the up-and-coming future world heavyweight champion, American James &quot;Bonecrusher&quot; Smith, halted that streak when he defeated Bruno by knockout in the tenth and final round of their bout, with Bruno leading clearly on all three judges&#x27; cards.

===European heavyweight champion and WBA title challenge===

Bruno won his next six bouts against respected opposition. He won the European heavyweight title with a KO over Sweden&#x27;s Anders Eklund, KO&#x27;d former European champion and world title contender Lucien Rodriguez in one round, was taken the distance for the first time by the useful world rated Phil Brown, and beat fringe fighters Larry Frazier and Jeff Jordan.

Bruno got back into title contention with a quick one-round KO win over former WBA champion Gerrie Coetzee of South Africa, and, in July 1986, he challenged Tim Witherspoon for the WBA heavyweight title. After once again leading on the cards for most of the fight, he ran out of steam and was defeated by knockout in round eleven.

Bruno once again got himself back into title contention with wins over former contender James Tillis and journeymen Reggie Gross and Chuck Gardner. In October 1987 Bruno faced the veteran Joe Bugner in an all-British match up. Bugner, although long past his peak, was coming off good wins over Greg Page, James Tillis and David Bey. Bruno won by TKO in the 8th round, the referee stopping the bout.

===Bruno vs. Tyson===

In February 1989, Bruno challenged Mike Tyson for the undisputed world heavyweight title. In the opening moments, the fighters came together with huge punches. Bruno&#x27;s legs buckled, and he took a big step back, inadvertently stepping off the ring apron. Bruno did not complain and continued, ultimately rocking Tyson (for the first time in Tyson&#x27;s career) with a left hook toward the end of the round. However, Tyson recovered and eventually beat Bruno when the referee stopped the contest in round five with Bruno taking heavy punishment on the ropes.

Bruno kept winning fights, helping him to retain his spot as one of the world&#x27;s leading heavyweights. He defeated contender Carl Williams, and then journeymen such as Jose Ribalta, Pierre Coetzer, and Dutchman Jan Emmen.

===Bruno vs. Lewis===

In 1993 he had a third world title chance against Lennox Lewis, who was making the second defence of the belt (his first of three championship reigns). The Lennox Lewis vs. Frank Bruno fight was the first time that two British boxers had fought for the world heavyweight title. Lewis beat Bruno on a stoppage in round seven, Bruno again failing to take his title chance after leading the contest on points up until what proved the final round.

Bruno again regrouped, dispatching Jesse Ferguson in one round and fringe contenders Rodolfo Marin and Mike Evans equally easily.

===WBC heavyweight champion and retirement===

On 2 September 1995, Bruno finally became world champion by outpointing WBC Champion Oliver McCall over twelve rounds. After an even start, Bruno built up a strong lead in the middle rounds before appearing to run somewhat out of steam in the last couple. However, unlike Bonecrusher Smith and Tim Witherspoon earlier in Bruno&#x27;s career, McCall was unable to find a way through Bruno&#x27;s defences to force the late stoppage he needed. Bruno won unanimously on points, only the second time he had taken an opponent to the judges. Bruno&#x27;s reign as champion was brief: the contract he signed to get McCall meant he had to face Mike Tyson in his first defence. Tyson beat Bruno on a stoppage in round three, Bruno performed unusually poorly in what turned out to be his last bout as a professional due to the recurrence of an eye injury, originally caused during his first fight with Tyson, which had already necessitated experimental surgery to allow him to fight again after that defeat. After the second Tyson fight Bruno was advised not to fight again to avoid running the risk of causing any more damage to it, which could result in permanent blindness. Bruno retired soon after that bout. In 2024, Bruno admitted on &quot;Four Kings&quot; mini documentary that the injury was retinal detachment.

Bruno&#x27;s publicist throughout most of his career was sports historian Norman Giller, who wrote three books with Bruno: &quot;Know What I Mean&quot;, &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; and &quot;From Zero to Hero&quot;. His manager for all but his last five fights was Terry Lawless, who signed him as a professional shortly after he had become ABA heavyweight champion at the age of eighteen.

==Personal life==

On 22 September 2003, Bruno was taken from his home near Brentwood in Essex by medical staff assisted by police officers, under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983. He was taken to Goodmayes Hospital in Ilford, where he underwent psychological and psychiatric tests. He had been suffering from depression for several months beforehand. He was later diagnosed as having bipolar disorder. On 9 October 2005, Bruno admitted that cocaine use, which began in 2000, had contributed to his mental health problems. Media coverage of Bruno&#x27;s problems raised controversy, the principal accusations being gross intrusion and insensitivity. Particular criticism was aimed at &quot;The Sun&quot;, whose headline in the first editions the next day read &quot;Bonkers Bruno Locked Up&quot;. Second editions retracted the headline and attempted to portray a more sympathetic attitude towards Bruno and mental health in general. As an attempt at atonement, the paper established a charity fund for people suffering from mental illness, although some mental health charities condemned &quot;The Sun&quot; latter action that day as being grossly hypocritical in the light of the former. On 24 February 2008, Bruno offered his support to former footballer Paul Gascoigne, who on 21 February had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Bruno also spoke on his own personal experiences in the mental health system at a conference run by Hari Sewell, on 22 June 2009. Bruno was sectioned again in 2012 and taken to St Andrew&#x27;s Hospital in Northampton for five weeks. In December 2013, Bruno spoke to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in support of their mental health campaign, stating: &quot;Mental illness is a terrible thing to have to cope with but I&#x27;ve learnt it&#x27;s a fight you can win if you live your life the right way&quot;.

In December 2005, Bruno announced that he was to become a father for the fourth time since finding new romance with old friend Yvonne Clydesdale. The couple, who first met five years previously at a health resort, began dating months after bumping into each other at a wine bar near his home. Yvonne gave birth to baby Freya on 10 May 2006. On 10 October 2006, Bruno and Clydesdale were jointly awarded £50,000 damages for libel against &quot;The People&quot; newspaper and publishers MGN in respect of false claims made about their relationship. In 2006, Bruno published an autobiography &quot;Frank: Fighting Back&quot;. It won the Best Autobiography category of the British Sports Book Awards. As of May 2012, Bruno was living in Glasgow with his new hairdresser girlfriend, Nina Coletta in the Gorbals area of the city.

Bruno has joined the Get Close and Personal Platform to raise funds to support The Frank Bruno Foundation, dedicated to improving the mental health of men around the world. Bruno offers one-to-one video calls with anybody wanting to discuss issues related to mental health and Bruno&#x27;s own journey.

In 2025, his daughter Rachel appeared as a contender in the second series of &quot;Gladiators&quot;, citing her father&#x27;s sporting success as being the inspiration for her participating.

==Media appearances and non-boxing interests==
Bruno&#x27;s image was enhanced by his relationship with the BBC boxing commentator Harry Carpenter, which, in their many interviews, his most-quoted phrase &quot;Know what I mean, Harry?&quot; originated. He appeared on Comic Relief programmes in the early-1980s and made frequent appearances thereafter on television and on stage (in pantomime).

In 1991, he opened &quot;The Ultimate&quot; at Lightwater Valley which was, at the time, the longest roller coaster in the world. He described the ride &quot;scarier than Mike Tyson&quot;. In 1993, Bruno briefly appeared as a guest on CITV&#x27;s &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; hosted by Neil Buchanan. The episode aired on Tuesday 30 March that year. He was the subject of a &quot;This is Your Life&quot; programme in 1993, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel. In 1995, the year of his world championship, he released a cover version of &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;, the theme song of the movie &quot;Rocky III&quot;. It reached No. 28 in the UK charts. In 1999, he featured on the celebrity special in the second season of &quot;Fort Boyard&quot;.

In January 2001, prior to that year&#x27;s general election, Bruno announced that he wanted to stand as the Conservative candidate in the traditionally safe Conservative seat of Brentwood and Ongar against the independent Member of Parliament, Martin Bell. His proposed slogan was &quot;Don&#x27;t be a plank, vote for Frank!&quot; However, this idea was quickly dismissed by Conservative Central Office. In an interview with BBC Sport at the time, Bruno laughed at the story and denied he had any intention of standing. In 2006, he was one of a number of celebrities who were recorded on the World Cup song, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are Kidding Jurgen Klinsmann?&quot;. On 15 August 2009, he appeared on &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; beating Duke McKenzie in the final for £12,800. He had a small role in the 2008 British crime drama &quot;Cass&quot;. Bruno made brief guest appearances in episodes of the ITV comedy show, &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot; in February and October 2011. On 21 April 2011, Bruno appeared on the ITV1 chat show &quot;The Alan Titchmarsh Show&quot;, where he was candid about his previous health issues. In 2011, he made a guest appearance in &quot;Sooty&quot;. On 20 April 2012, Bruno was featured in the ITV series &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot;.

He supports West Ham United F.C. whilst also having an affinity for the Scottish team, Aberdeen F.C.

Bruno completed the 2011 London Marathon which is the third marathon he has run successfully. He has also run numerous half marathons. He is also a patron for The Shannon Bradshaw Trust, a children&#x27;s charity.
Bruno regularly makes personal appearances and also sells autographed items of memorabilia. On 23 July 2013, Bruno was featured in the BBC Three documentary with his daughter Rachel in &quot;Rachel Bruno: My Dad and Me&quot;.

In 2020 amid the COVID-19 crisis, Frank Bruno joined a group of celebrities called The Celebs which included Kellie Shirley and X Factor winner Sam Bailey to raise money for both Alzheimer&#x27;s Society and Action for Children. They recorded a new rendition of &quot;Merry Christmas Everyone&quot; by Shakin&#x27; Stevens and it was released digitally on 11 December 2020, on independent record label Saga Entertainment. The music video debuted on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; the day before release. The song peaked at number two on the iTunes pop chart.

In 2024, Bruno joined fellow London boxers - Lennox Lewis, Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank for Four Kings mini documentary.
