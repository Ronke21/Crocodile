<text>Jaron Zepel Lanier (, born May 3, 1960) is an American computer scientist, visual artist, computer philosophy writer, technologist, futurist, and composer of contemporary classical music. Considered a founder of the field of virtual reality, Lanier and Thomas G. Zimmerman left Atari in 1985 to found VPL Research, Inc., the first company to sell VR goggles and wired gloves. In the late 1990s, Lanier worked on applications for Internet2, and in the 2000s, he was a visiting scholar at Silicon Graphics and various universities. In 2006 he began to work at Microsoft, and from 2009 has worked at Microsoft Research as an Interdisciplinary Scientist.

Lanier has composed contemporary classical music and is a collector of rare instruments (of which he owns one to two thousand); his acoustic album, &quot;Instruments of Change&quot; (1994) features Asian wind and string instruments such as the khene mouth organ, the suling flute, and the sitar-like esraj. Lanier teamed with Mario Grigorov to compose the soundtrack to the documentary film &quot;The Third Wave&quot; (2007).

In 2005, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; named Lanier as one of the top 100 Public Intellectuals. In 2010, Lanier was named to the &quot;TIME&quot; 100 list of most influential people. In 2014, &quot;Prospect&quot; named Lanier one of the top 50 World Thinkers. In 2018, &quot;Wired&quot; named Lanier one of the top 25 most influential people over the last 25 years of technological history.

==Early life and education==
Born Jaron Zepel Lanier in New York City, Lanier was raised in Mesilla, New Mexico. Lanier&#x27;s mother and father were Jewish; his mother was a Nazi concentration camp survivor from Vienna, and his father&#x27;s family had emigrated from Ukraine to escape the pogroms. When he was nine years old, his mother was killed in a car accident. He lived in tents for an extended period with his father before embarking on a seven-year project to build a geodesic dome home that he helped design.

At the age of 13, Lanier convinced New Mexico State University to let him enroll. At NMSU, he took graduate-level courses; he received a grant from the National Science Foundation to study mathematical notation, which led him to learn computer programming.

From 1979 to 1980, Lanier&#x27;s NSF-funded project at NMSU focused on &quot;digital graphical simulations for learning&quot;. Lanier also attended art school in New York during this time, but returned to New Mexico and worked as an assistant to a midwife. The father of a baby he helped deliver gave him a car as a gift, which Lanier later drove to Santa Cruz.

==Atari Labs, VPL Research (1983–1990)==
He made a game Moon Dust for Commodore which led to a job at Atari. In California, while working for Atari Inc., he met Thomas Zimmerman, inventor of the data glove. After Atari was split into two companies in 1984, Lanier became unemployed. The free time enabled him to concentrate on his own projects, including VPL, a &quot;post-symbolic&quot; visual programming language. Along with Zimmerman, Lanier founded VPL Research, focusing on commercializing virtual reality technologies; the company prospered for a while, but filed for bankruptcy in 1990. In 1999, Sun Microsystems bought VPL&#x27;s virtual reality and graphics-related patents.

==Internet2, visiting scholar (1997–2001)==
From 1997 to 2001, Lanier was the Chief Scientist of Advanced Network and Services, which contained the Engineering Office of Internet2, and served as the Lead Scientist of the &#x27;National Tele-immersion Initiative&#x27;, a coalition of research universities studying advanced applications for Internet2. The Initiative demonstrated the first prototypes of tele-immersion in 2000 after a three-year development period. From 2001 to 2004, he was visiting scientist at Silicon Graphics Inc., where he developed solutions to core problems in telepresence and tele-immersion. He was also visiting scholar with the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University (1997–2001), a visiting artist with New York University&#x27;s Interactive Telecommunications Program, and a founding member of the International Institute for Evolution and the Brain.

==Personal life==
Jaron Lanier and his wife, Lena, have one child, a daughter.

==Selected list of works in prose==

=== &quot;One-Half of a Manifesto&quot; (2000) ===

In &quot;One-Half a Manifesto&quot;, Lanier criticizes the claims made by writers such as Ray Kurzweil, and opposes the prospect of so-called &quot;cybernetic totalism&quot;, which is &quot;a cataclysm brought on when computers become ultra-intelligent masters of matter and life.&quot; Lanier&#x27;s position is that humans may not be considered to be biological computers, i.e., they may not be compared to digital computers in any proper sense, and it is very unlikely that humans could be generally replaced by computers easily in a few decades, even economically. While transistor count increases according to Moore&#x27;s law, overall performance rises only very slowly. According to Lanier, this is because human productivity in developing software increases only slightly, and software becomes more bloated and remains as error-prone as it ever was. &quot;Simply put, software just won&#x27;t allow it. Code can&#x27;t keep up with processing power now, and it never will.&quot;

===Post-symbolic communication (2006)===
Some of Lanier&#x27;s speculation involves what he calls &quot;post-symbolic communication&quot;. In his April 2006 &quot;Discover&quot; magazine column, he writes about cephalopods (i.e., the various species of octopus, squid, and related molluscs), many of which are able to morph their bodies, including changing the pigmentation and texture of their skin, as well as forming complex shape imitations with their limbs. Lanier sees this behavior, especially as exchanged between two octopodes, as a direct behavioral expression of thought.

=== Wikipedia and the omniscience of collective wisdom (2006)===
In his online essay &quot;Digital Maoism: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism&quot;, in &quot;Edge&quot; magazine in May 2006, Lanier criticized the sometimes-claimed omniscience of collective wisdom (including examples such as the Wikipedia article about him, which he said recurrently exaggerates his film directing work), describing it as &quot;digital Maoism&quot;. He writes &quot;If we start to believe that the Internet itself is an entity that has something to say, we&#x27;re devaluing those people [creating the content] and making ourselves into idiots.&quot;

His criticism aims at several targets that concern him and are at different levels of abstraction:
* any attempt to create one final authoritative bottleneck that channels the knowledge onto society is wrong, regardless of whether it is a Wikipedia or any algorithmically created system producing meta information,
* it creates a false sense of authority behind the information,
* a sterile style of wiki writing is undesirable because:
** it removes the touch with the real author of original information, it filters the subtlety of the opinions of the author, essential information (for example, the graphical context of original sources) is lost,
* collective authorship tends to produce or align to mainstream or organizational beliefs,
* he worries that collectively created works may be manipulated behind the scenes by anonymous groups of editors who bear no visible responsibility,
** and that this kind of activity might create future totalitarian systems as these are basically grounded on misbehaved collectives that oppress individuals.

This critique is further explored in an interview with him on Radio National&#x27;s &quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Zone&quot;, where he is critical of the denatured effect that &quot;removes the scent of people&quot;.

In December 2006 Lanier followed up his critique of the collective wisdom with an article in &quot;Edge&quot; entitled &quot;Beware the Online Collective&quot;.
Lanier writes:

I wonder if some aspect of human nature evolved in the context of competing packs. We might be genetically wired to be vulnerable to the lure of the mob... What&#x27;s to stop an online mass of anonymous but connected people from suddenly turning into a mean mob, just like masses of people have time and time again in the history of every human culture? It&#x27;s amazing that details in the design of online software can bring out such varied potentials in human behavior. It&#x27;s time to think about that power on a moral basis.

Lanier argues that the search for deeper information in any area sooner or later requires finding information that has been produced by a single person, or a few devoted individuals: &quot;You have to have a chance to sense personality in order for language to have its full meaning.&quot; That is, he sees limitations in the utility of an encyclopedia produced by only partially interested third parties as a form of communication.

=== &quot;You Are Not a Gadget&quot; (2010) ===

In his book &quot;You Are Not a Gadget&quot; (2010), Lanier criticizes what he perceives as the hive mind of Web 2.0 (wisdom of the crowd) and describes the open source and open content expropriation of intellectual production as a form of &quot;Digital Maoism&quot;. Lanier accuses Web 2.0 developments of devaluing progress and innovation, as well as glorifying the collective at the expense of the individual. He criticizes Wikipedia and Linux as examples of this problem; Wikipedia for what he sees as: its &quot;mob rule&quot; by anonymous editors, the weakness of its non-scientific content, and its bullying of experts.

Lanier also argues that there are limitations to certain aspects of the open source and content movement in that they lack the ability to create anything truly new and innovative. For example, Lanier argues that the open source movement did not create the iPhone. In another example, Lanier further accuses Web 2.0 of making search engines lazy, destroying the potential of innovative websites such as Thinkquest, and hampering the communication of ideas such as mathematics to a wider audience.

Lanier further argues that the open source approach has destroyed opportunities for the middle class to finance content creation, and results in the concentration of wealth in a few individuals—&quot;the lords of the clouds&quot;—people who, more by virtue of luck rather than true innovation, manage to insert themselves as content concentrators at strategic times and locations in the cloud. In the book, Lanier also criticizes the MIDI Standard for musical instrument commonality.

=== &quot;Who Owns the Future?&quot; (2013) ===
In his book &quot;Who Owns the Future?&quot; (2013), Lanier posits that the middle class is increasingly disenfranchised from online economies. By convincing users to give away valuable information about themselves in exchange for free services, firms can accrue large amounts of data at virtually no cost. Lanier calls these firms &quot;Siren Servers&quot;, alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses. Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the Siren Servers concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data centers.

For example, he points to Google&#x27;s translation algorithm, which amalgamates previous translations uploaded by people online, giving the user its best guess. The people behind the source translations receive no payment for their work, while Google profits from increased ad visibility as a powerful Siren Server. In another example, Lanier points out that in 1988, Kodak employed 140,000 people when it led the digital imaging industry. By 2012, Kodak had filed for bankruptcy due to free photo-sharing sites such as Instagram that employed only 13 people at the time.

As a solution to these problems, Lanier puts forth an alternative structure to the web based on Ted Nelson&#x27;s Project Xanadu. He proposes a two-way linking system that would point to the source of any piece of information, creating an economy of micropayments that compensates people for original material they post to the web.

=== &quot;Dawn of the New Everything&quot; (2017) ===
In his book &quot;Dawn of the New Everything: Encounters with Reality and Virtual Reality&quot; (2017), Lanier reflects on his upbringing in 1960s New Mexico, his lifelong relationship with technology, and his path to Silicon Valley. Part personal memoir and part rumination on virtual reality, Lanier highlights VR&#x27;s versatility both in historical context and projects its functions into the future.

Lanier writes of VR&#x27;s capacity to engage and inspire more than any other kind of technology (&quot;TV and video games draw people into a zombielike trance ... while VR is active and makes you tired after a while&quot;). He writes that the older, poorer VR equipment might have done an even better job at exposing one&#x27;s own process of perception, since &quot;the best enjoyment of VR includes not really being convinced. Like when you go to a magic show.&quot; And he underscores how VR inherently helps the user focus on reality, rather than the virtual world, explaining that the best magic of VR happens in the moments right after the demo ends (his lab would often present flowers to visitors coming out of the headset, as the visitor would experience them as though for the first time).

Lanier cites modern VR&#x27;s rich résumé beyond gaming and entertainment: it has been used to treat war veterans overcoming PTSD; by doctors to perform intricate surgeries; by paraplegics wanting to feel the sense of flight; and as a mechanism to prototype almost every vehicle fabricated in the last two decades. Throughout the book Lanier intersperses fifty-one definitions of VR, illuminating its many uses, gifts, and pitfalls.

===&quot;Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now&quot; (2018)===
As the name implies, Lanier is concerned about the influence of social media, and many of his criticisms of social media will feel familiar to observers of American politics and culture. In essence the claim is that platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have made their users cruder, less empathetic, more tribal. Lanier worries that reliance on social media platforms is reducing people&#x27;s capacity for spirituality, and that social media users are in essence turning into automated extensions of the platforms.

===&quot;There Is No A.I.&quot; (2023)===
In April 2023, Lanier published an alternative view of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as less intelligent than the name, and popular culture, may suggest. Lanier concludes his essay as follows: &quot;Think of people. People are the answer to the problems of bits.&quot;

==Assessment of the Internet==
Lanier asserted in 1998 that the Internet mirrors the contemporary culture accurately, 
The Internet has created the most precise mirror of people as a whole that we&#x27;ve yet had. It is not a summary prepared by a social scientist or an elite think tank. It is not the hagiography of an era, condensed by a romantic idealist or a sneering cynic. It is the real us, available for direct inspection for the first time. Our collective window shades are now open. We see the mundanity, the avarice, the ugliness, the perversity, the loneliness, the love, the inspiration, the serendipity, and the tenderness that manifest in humanity. Seen in proportion, we can breathe a sigh of relief. We are basically OK.

==Views about Wikipedia==
While talking to Simon Hattenstone Lanier said: 

==Music==
As a musician, Lanier has been active in the world of contemporary classical music, sometimes known as &quot;new classical&quot;, since the late 1970s. He is a pianist and a specialist in many non-western musical instruments, especially the wind and string instruments of Asia. He maintains one of the largest and most varied collections of actively-played rare instruments in the world. Lanier owns a BACH.Bow, a convex curved bow which, unlike the ordinary bow, renders possible polyphonic playing on the various strings of a string instrument. Lanier has performed with artists as diverse as Philip Glass, Ornette Coleman, George Clinton, Vernon Reid, Terry Riley, Duncan Sheik, Pauline Oliveros, and Stanley Jordan. Recording projects include his acoustic techno duet with Sean Lennon and an album of duets with flutist Robert Dick.

Lanier also writes chamber and orchestral music. Current commissions include an opera that will premiere in Busan, South Korea, and a symphony, &quot;Symphony for Amelia&quot;, premiered by the Bach Festival Society Orchestra and Choir in Winter Park, Florida, in October 2010. Recent commissions include &quot;Earthquake!&quot; a ballet that premiered at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco in April 2006; &quot;Little Shimmers&quot; for the TroMetrik ensemble, which premiered at ODC in San Francisco in April 2006; &quot;Daredevil&quot; for the ArrayMusic chamber ensemble, which premiered in Toronto in 2006; A concert-length sequence of works for orchestra and virtual worlds (including &quot;Canons for Wroclaw&quot;, &quot;Khaenoncerto&quot;, &quot;The Egg&quot;, and others) celebrating the 1000th birthday of the city of Wrocław, Poland, premiered in 2000; A triple concerto, &quot;The Navigator Tree&quot;, commissioned by the National Endowment for the Arts and the American Composers Forum, premiered in 2000; and &quot;Mirror/Storm&quot;, a symphony commissioned by the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, which premiered in 1998. &quot;Continental Harmony&quot; was a PBS special that documented the development and premiere of &quot;The Navigator Tree&quot; won a CINE Golden Eagle Award.

In 1994, he released the contemporary classical music album &quot;Instruments of Change&quot; on POINT Music/Philips/PolyGram Records. The album has been described by Stephen Hill, on &quot;The Crane Flies West 2&quot; (episode 357) of Hearts of Space, as a Western exploration of Asian musical traditions. Lanier is currently working on a book, &quot;Technology and the Future of the Human Soul&quot;, and a music album, &quot;Proof of Consciousness&quot;, in collaboration with Mark Deutsch.

Lanier&#x27;s work with Asian instruments can be heard extensively on the soundtrack of &quot;Three Seasons&quot; (1999), which was the first film ever to win both the Audience and Grand Jury awards at the Sundance Film Festival. He and Mario Grigorov scored a film entitled &quot;The Third Wave&quot;, which premiered at Sundance in 2007. He is working with Terry Riley on a collaborative opera to be entitled &quot;Bastard, the First&quot;.

Lanier has also pioneered the use of Virtual Reality in musical stage performance with his band Chromatophoria, which has toured around the world as a headline act in venues such as the Montreux Jazz Festival. He plays virtual instruments and uses real instruments to guide events in virtual worlds. In October 2010, Lanier collaborated with Rollins College and John V. Sinclair&#x27;s Bach Festival Choir and Orchestra for his Worldwide Premiere of &quot;Symphony for Amelia&quot;.

Lanier contributed the afterword to &quot;Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture&quot; (MIT Press, 2008) edited by Paul D. Miller, a.k.a. DJ Spooky.

On May 9, 1999, Lanier authored a &quot;New York Times&quot; opinion piece entitled &quot;Piracy is Your Friend&quot; in which he argued that the record labels were a much bigger threat to artists than piracy. The original article is no longer available, but an excerpt entitled &quot;Making an Ally of Piracy&quot; exists with the same date. The original article is quoted in a separate New York Times article by Neil Strauss, also with the same date. On November 20, 2007, he published a &quot;mea culpa&quot; sequel entitled &quot;Pay Me for My Content&quot;, again in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

On August 31st, 2023, Lainer made a guest appearance as a pianist onstage at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, California, improvising at John Zorn&#x27;s 70th Birthday celebration along with Bill Frisell, Laurie Anderson, Dave Lombardo, and Zorn.

==Memberships==
Lanier has served on numerous advisory boards, including the Board of Councilors of the University of Southern California, Medical Media Systems (a medical visualization spin-off company associated with Dartmouth College), for the Microdisplay Corporation, and for NY3D (developers of auto stereo displays).

In 1997, he was a founding member of the &#x27;National Tele-Immersion Initiative&#x27;, an effort devoted to using computer technology to give people who are separated by great distances the illusion that they are physically together. Lanier is a member of the Global Business Network, part of the Monitor Group.

==In the media==
He has appeared in several documentaries, including the 1990 documentary &quot;Cyberpunk&quot;, 1992 Danish television documentary &quot;Computerbilleder – udfordring til virkeligheden&quot; (in English: &quot;Computer Pictures - A Challenge to Reality&quot;), the 1995 documentary &quot;Synthetic Pleasures&quot;, the 2004 television documentary &quot;Rage Against the Machines,&quot; and the 2020 Netflix documentary &quot;The Social Dilemma&quot;. Lanier was credited as one of the miscellaneous crew for the 2002 film &quot;Minority Report&quot;. Lanier stated that his role was to help make up the gadgets and scenarios. Lanier has appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;, and &quot;The Tavis Smiley Show&quot;. He appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The View&quot; during the final seven minutes of the show on 19 June 2018, promoting his book &quot;Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now&quot;. He was a guest on the &quot;Radiolab&quot; podcast episode &quot;The Cataclysm Sentence&quot;, released on 18 April 2020. Lanier was interviewed by Andrew Yang in the &quot;Yang Speaks&quot; podcast, episode entitled &quot;Who owns your data? Jaron Lanier has the answer&quot; on May 28, 2020. Lanier appeared on the Lex Fridman podcast on September 6, 2021 to talk about his views on AI, social media, VR and the future of humanity. He has had speaking engagements and presentations at Concordia University Wisconsin and University Temple United Methodist Church.

<text>The Gewehr 43 or Karabiner 43 (abbreviated G43, K43, Gew 43, Kar 43) is a 7.92×57mm Mauser caliber semi-automatic rifle developed by Germany during World War II. The design was based on that of the earlier G41(W) but incorporated an improved short-stroke piston gas system similar to that of the Soviet SVT-40.

==History==
Germany&#x27;s quest for a semi-automatic infantry rifle resulted in two designs – the G41(M) and G41(W), from Mauser and Walther Arms respectively. The Mauser design was introduced in 1941 and at least 12,755 were made, but it proved unreliable in combat. The Walther design fared better in combat but still suffered from reliability problems. The problems with both designs stemmed from a demand made by the Army that the rifles would not use holes drilled into the barrel, known as &quot;gas ports&quot;, to run the automatic loading mechanism. Meeting this requirement meant the designs had to use uncommon mechanisms that were simply unreliable and highly prone to fouling.

The German invasion of the Soviet Union led to small numbers of the SVT-40 being captured and returned to Germany for examination. These used a simple gas mechanism powered from a port cut into the barrel about 1/3 of the way back from the end and replaced the conventional stripper reloads with a modern box magazine. It was clearly superior to the G41, and simpler as well. In 1943, Walther combined a similar gas system with aspects of the G41(W) providing greatly improved performance. It was accepted and entered into service as the Gewehr 43, renamed Karabiner 43 in April 1944, with production amounting to just over 400,000 between 1943 and 1945.

==Gewehr 43/Karabiner 43==
In 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union as part of Operation Barbarossa. Just prior to the opening of hostilities the Soviet Red Army had started re-arming its infantry, complementing its older bolt-action rifles with the new semi-automatic SVT-38s and SVT-40s. This was a shock to the Germans, who ramped up their own semi-automatic rifle development efforts significantly.

The SVT series used a simpler gas-operated mechanism, which was soon emulated by Walther in its successor to the G41(W), producing the Gewehr 43 (or G43). The simpler, sturdier design and mechanism of the G43 made it lighter, easier to produce, more reliable, and also much tougher than the Gewehr 41; German mountain troops would use them as ladder rungs during climbing. The addition of a 10-round stamped-steel detachable box magazine was an improvement over the integral box magazine of the G41(W). Soldiers armed with the weapon typically carried one standard stripper clip pouch and a Gewehr 43 pouch with two spare magazines. The G43 utilizes the same flapper-locked mechanism as its predecessor. The Gewehr 43 was put into production in October 1943 and followed in 1944 by the Karabiner 43 (K43), which was identical to the G43 in every way except for the letter stamped on the side. The name change from Gewehr to Karabiner (carbine) was due to the fact the barrel was actually two centimeters shorter than the standard Karabiner 98k and therefore the term Gewehr (meaning: rifle) was somewhat unfitting. The Wehrmacht intended to equip each grenadier (infantry) company in the army with 19 G43s, including 10 with scopes, for issue as the company commander saw fit. This issue was never completely achieved.
The iron sight line had a hooded pointed-post-type front sight and a tangent-type rear sight with a V-shaped rear notch. These standard sight lines consisted of somewhat coarse aiming elements, making it suitable for rough field handling, aiming at distant area fire targets, and low-light usage, but less suitable for precise aiming at distant or small point targets. It is graduated for 7.92×57mm Mauser &quot;s.S. Patrone&quot; cartridges loaded with s.S. (&quot;schweres Spitzgeschoss&quot; – &quot;heavy pointed bullet&quot;) ball bullets from in increments.

Gewehr 43s were made by Berlin-Lübecker Maschinenfabrik in Lübeck (weapons coded &quot;duv&quot;, and later &quot;qve&quot;), Walther (weapons coded &quot;AC&quot;) and the Wilhelm Gustloff Stiftung(weapons coded &quot;bcd&quot;). Walther used its satellite production facilities at Neuengamme concentration camp in addition to its main production facilities at Zella-Mehlis to make the rifles (It does not appear that complete weapons were assembled in the camps, similar to how Radom P35 pistols were assembled in occupied Radom, Poland without their barrels, which were built and installed by Steyr in Austria), Wilhelm Gustloff-Werke used some slave workers to augment its depleted staff from Buchenwald concentration camp. The total production by the end of the war is estimated to have been 402,713 of both models, including at least 53,435 sniper rifles: these G43/K43s were used as designated marksman/sniper weapons, fitted with the Zielfernrohr 43 (ZF 43/ZF 4) telescopic sight with 4× magnification. The weapon was originally designed for use with the &quot;Schießbecher&quot; rifle grenade launcher (standard on the Karabiner 98k as well) and the &quot;Schalldämpfer&quot; suppressor, however, these accessories were deemed unsuccessful in tests and were dropped even before the rifle made it to serial production.

The Gewehr 43 stayed in service with the Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Army for several years after the war. Likewise, the East German Border Troops and Volkspolizei were issued reworked G43 rifles, which are recognizable by a sunburst proof mark near the serial number and the serial number engraved by electro pencil on removable components.

==Other details==
There were many small variations introduced on the G43/K43 throughout its production cycle. The important consideration is that no changes were made to the rifle design specifically to coincide with the nomenclature change from Gewehr to Karabiner, with the exception of the letter stamped on the side. A careful study of actual pieces will show that many G-marked rifles had features found on K-marked rifles and vice versa. There is therefore no difference in weight or length between the G43 and the K43. Although G43s have threaded muzzles with removable nuts for a blank adapter, the K43 does not have this feature. Variations in barrel length did exist, but those were the product of machining tolerances, differences between factories, and/or experimental long-barreled rifles. An unknown number of late-war K43 rifles were chambered for the 7.92×33mm Kurz cartridge and modified to accept StG44 magazines.

Though most G43/K43s are equipped with a telescopic sight mounting rail, the vast majority of the rifles were issued in their standard infantry form without a scope. About 50,000 scoped variants of the G43/K43sG.43 were produced. When equipped with a scope, it was exclusively the ZF 4, a 4x magnification telescopic sight. The ZF4 was adjustable for elevation and windage using drums. The range drum on top featured bullet drop compensation in increments for ranges from . No other known scope and scope mount combinations were installed by the German military on G43/K43&#x27;s during World War II. Many strange variations have shown up after the war, but all have been proven to be the work of amateur gunsmiths. Rifles with broken-off butts are common, as German soldiers were instructed to render semi-automatic rifles useless when in danger of capture.

==Gewehr-43-based &quot;Gerät 03&quot; prototype==
In June 1943 the Mauser Werke&#x27;s Weapons Research Institute and Weapons Development Group decided to adopt the Gewehr 43 design to use a relatively cheap to produce roller locked action. The production pattern Gewehr 43 used a more expensive to produce and less sturdy Kjellman-style flapper locking system. These locking methods are similar in concept. By December 1943 Mauser Werke&#x27;s Weapons Research Institute and Weapons Development Group had completed a roller-locked prototype rifle designated as the Gerät 03. Aside from the differing action, the &quot;Gerät 03&quot; prototype resembled the Gewehr 43. Although the prototype rifle was machined it was designed with pressing and stamping steel components production methods in mind to simplify mass production and keep production costs low.
Only a few prototypes were built and the &quot;Gerät 03&quot; never went into production, but the &quot;Gerät 03&quot; was put through a 5,000-round endurance trial. The &quot;Gerät 03&quot; semi-automatic rifle used a fully locked action design with a gas system, using a gas piston to unlock. During test firing, the development group noticed an undesirable tendency in the &quot;Gerät 03&quot; action to exhibit bolt-bounce. It was possible to unintentionally fire the &quot;Gerät 03&quot; during the bounce phase, at which the action was not fully locked. This opened the &quot;Gerät 03&quot; action much faster and under much higher pressure than the gas system was supposed to allow. This observation of a harmonics problem in the roller/wedge system led to the idea and development of the intentionally never fully locked roller-delayed blowback action design, which does not require a gas system.

==Shooters kits for historic rifles==
The original gas system of the Gewehr 43 is copiously gassed and was designed for using World War II German service ammunition in the presence of heavy fouling or icing. Being ammunition specific, the gas system was not adjustable to various propellant and projectile-specific pressure behavior and so modern (higher pressure C.I.P. conform 7.92×57mm Mauser) ammunition can move the gas piston overly fast and hard against the bolt carrier which in turn hits the receiver harder. Especially on late war Gewehr 43&#x27;s the steel quality of the sheet metal rear of the receiver could be poor and the heat treatment of the bolt carrier could be suboptimal. This can lead to increased wear and damage to guns and in worse scenarios possibly endanger shooters. For shooting historic Gewehr 43&#x27;s commercial &quot;shooters kits&quot; have been developed that basically replace the gas cup and the gas plug with new ones, and the gas plug is threaded to accept different sized gas orifices so the gas system can be adjusted to cycle reliably with the specific pressure behavior of the ammunition used.

<doc id="332894" wikidata="Q347688" url="?curid=332894" title="Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada">
<text>Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada y Rivera, also spelled as Ximénez and De Quezada, (; 1509 – 16 February 1579) was a Spanish explorer and conquistador in northern South America, territories currently known as Colombia. He explored the territory named by him, New Kingdom of Granada, and founded its capital, Santafé de Bogotá. As a well-educated lawyer he was one of the intellectuals of the Spanish conquest. He was an effective organizer and leader, designed the first legislation for the government of the area, and was its historian. He was governor of Cartagena between 1556 and 1557, and after 1569 he undertook explorations toward the east, searching for the elusive &quot;El Dorado&quot;. The campaign didn&#x27;t succeed and Jiménez then returned to New Granada in 1573. He has been suggested as a possible model for Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

== Family ==
His father, Luis Jiménez de Quesada, was a &quot;hidalgo&quot; relative of Gonzalo Francisco de Cordoba, and he had two well-known distant cousins, the conquistadores of Mexico and Peru respectively: Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro. He had three younger brothers; Hernán and Francisco, who also were conquistadors, and Melchor, a priest, and a sister, Andrea.

== Conquest of the Muisca Confederation ==

De Quesada was an Andalusian lawyer, trained in Granada. He was appointed chief magistrate in 1535 and second in command for an expedition to present-day Colombia, because in that period he was not in good standing with the people at home because he had just lost an important court case in which his mother&#x27;s family was economically involved. The commander of the expedition, Pedro Fernández de Lugo (governor of the Canary Islands), had bought the governorship of Santa Marta and had equipped a fleet and assembled over a thousand men. And so they set sail to Santa Marta, thinking they would find a very rich land, full of gold and pearls. But when, after two month of navigation, they reached the small coastal settlement of Santa Marta, all they found was a conglomeration of hovels and filthy, disease-ridden colonists who went about dressed in skins or roughly woven and padded cotton clothes made by the natives from surrounding areas. Soon food became scarce and tropical fevers began to smite down the strongest.

In 1536, De Quesada (who had no military experience) was chosen by De Lugo to command an expedition to explore into the interior of New Granada, hoping to discover the dreamed El Dorado. A land party under De Quesada, with Hernán Pérez de Quesada (his brother), Juan San Martín, Juan del Junco (as second in command) Lázaro Fonte and Sergio Bustillo, struck south from Santa Marta, crossed the Cesar River, and arrived at Tamalameque on the Magdalena River. A support fleet of 6 (or 5) ships had also sailed from Santa Marta with 900 men to navigate the Magdalena. Only two of the vessels actually arrived at Tamalameque, and subsequently returned to Santa Marta with many of De Quesada&#x27;s men. Continuing up the Magdalena as far as La Tora (Barrancabermeja), De Quesada and his men ascended the Opon River into the cordillera, reaching the Opon hills, Chipata (near Vélez) (March 1537) and the valley of the Suárez River. Passing Lake Fúquene and Lake Suesca, they reached Nemocón and Zipaquirá and finally entered the Muisca Confederation (ruled from Muyquytá, present day Funza and Hunza, on which the Spanish city Tunja was founded).

Only 180 men out of 800 survived, suffering terribly in the jungle: they were forced to eat snakes, lizards, frogs, and even the leather torn from their harnesses and the scabbards of their swords. In Bogotá, Quesada resigned and called for an election; he was elected captain-general, and threw off the last link that held him to the governor. The Muisca had two rulers. The &quot;psihipqua&quot; Bogotá, ruled in Muyquytá; the other, the &quot;hoa&quot; Eucaneme, ruled in Hunza. Taking advantage of a war between the two chiefdoms, Quesada&#x27;s force subdued Muyquytá and then successfully attacked Hunza. At this point it was time to establish a settlement so that the earth itself might properly belong to De Quesada and his men. They chose a spot next to the towering peaks of the east, where the land was high and the rains would quickly run off, where the mountains would protect them from attackers and the jungles below. Quesada placed his right foot on the bare earth and said simply, &quot;I take possession of this land in the name of the most sovereign emperor, Charles V.&quot;

Quesada remained in the region until the arrival of two expeditions at the end of 1538: Sebastián de Belalcázar from Quito, modern-day capital of Ecuador, one of the captains of Pizarro who had mutinied against his leader; and Nikolaus Federmann, a German from Venezuela. The three captains met on the savanna of New Granada. All three wanted to claim New Granada for themselves. In order to resolve their dispute, De Quesada persuaded them to go back to Spain with him and to submit their rival territorial claims to the arbitration of the crown. In July 1539, they sailed for Spain from Cartagena. However, none of them obtained the governorship. De Quesada, after nearly a dozen years of wandering disconsolately through the gaming halls of Europe, returned to New Granada in 1550. Here, he settled down to live for nearly thirty years. He was a respected settler, becoming the most influential man in the Kingdom. He protected his fellow colonists from the severity of the officials and restrained the &quot;encomenderos&quot; (large landholders) greed. But his own desire for wealth and gold continued to live inside him.

== Later expeditions ==
In 1569, at the age of 63, De Quesada received a commission to conquer the Llanos to the east of the Colombian cordillera. From Bogotá in April 1569 with 500 mounted soldiers, 1500 natives, 1100 horses and pack animals, 600 head of cattle, 800 pigs, a large number of negro slaves and 8 priests, he first descended to Mesetas on the upper Guejar River. There most of the livestock was destroyed by a grass fire. De Quesada&#x27;s expedition then moved to nearby San Juan de los Llanos, where a course was set for east-southeast (by the guide Pedro Soleto), and maintained for the following two years. After a year or so some men returned with Juan Maldonado, reaching San Juan after six months with few survivors. De Quesada eventually reached (San Fernando de) Atabapo at the confluence of the Guaviare and the Orinoco (in December 1571), any further movement requiring the construction of ships. He therefore dejectedly returned to Bogotá, arriving in December 1572 with only 25 Spaniards, 4 natives, 18 horses and 2 priests. The expedition had been one of the most expensive disasters on record. After a brief period of service in a frontier command (during which he suppressed an indigenous uprising) De Quesada, affected by leprosy, overcome with despair at his debts, owing more than 60 thousand ducats, was forced to seek a milder climate and died quietly, aged 70, in Mariquita, an important market town in the New Kingdom of Granada.

=== Death and legacy ===
After his death in Mariquita, he was buried in the Santa Lucía Abbey. His remains were there until 1597, when they were exhumed and transferred to Bogotá, the city founded by him.

<doc id="332896" wikidata="Q583448" url="?curid=332896" title="Roger Tory Peterson">
<text>Roger Tory Peterson (August 28, 1908 – July 28, 1996) was an American naturalist, conservationist, citizen scientist ornithologist, artist and illustrator, educator, and a founder of the 20th-century environmental movement, where he was an inspiration for many.

==Background==
Peterson was born in Jamestown, New York, a small, industrial city in western New York, on August 28, 1908. His father, Charles Gustav Peterson, was an immigrant from Sweden who came to America as an infant. At the age of ten, Charles Peterson lost his father to appendicitis and was sent off to work in the mills. After leaving the mills, he earned his living as a traveling salesman. Roger&#x27;s mother, Henrietta Badar, was an immigrant, at the age of four, of German and Polish extraction, who grew up in Rochester, New York. She went to a teachers&#x27; college, and was teaching in Elmira, New York, when she met Charles. The two married, and moved to Jamestown, where Charles took a job at a local furniture factory.

Roger&#x27;s middle name pays homage to his Uncle Tory, who resided in Oil City, Pennsylvania, located south of Jamestown. He graduated from high school in 1925 and went to work in one of Jamestown&#x27;s many furniture companies. During his high school years, one of his teachers, Miss Hornbeck, had encouraged his interest in sketching and painting birds and nature, while he waited to earn enough money to purchase a camera. Several months after graduating, he traveled to New York City to attend a meeting of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union, where he met distinguished figures such as the artist Louis Agassiz Fuertes and up-and-comers like Joseph Hickey.

Soon after, he moved to New York City and earned money by painting furniture, so that he could attend classes at the Art Students League in 1927-1929 and later at the National Academy of Design. He also managed to gain entrance to the eventually famous Bronx County Bird Club, though not himself from the Bronx. He hoped to attend Cornell University, but his family&#x27;s finances were not sufficient for the cost of tuition. Instead, he managed to obtain a position as an art instructor at the Rivers School in Brookline, Massachusetts. In 1934, his &quot;A Field Guide to the Birds&quot; was published. The initial run of 2,000 copies sold out within a week.

Peterson was married three times: briefly, to Mildred Washington, for 33 years to Barbara Coulter, with whom he had two sons, and for 20 years to Virginia Westervelt. His second and third wives contributed to the research and organization of his guides. Virginia Marie Peterson developed the species range maps that were introduced in the fifth edition of &quot;A Field Guide to the Birds of Eastern and Central North America&quot;.

==Career==
Peterson&#x27;s first work on birds was an article titled &quot;Notes from Field and Study&quot; published in the magazine &quot;Bird-Lore.&quot; In this piece, he recorded two anecdotal sight records from 1925: a Carolina wren and a titmouse.

In 1934 he published the first edition of his popular &quot;Guide to the Birds&quot;, considered by some to be the first modern field guide. The first printing of 2‚000 copies sold out in one week and the book subsequently went through six editions. One of the inspirations for his field guide was a diagram of ducks, created by Ernest Thompson Seton in his book &quot;Two Little Savages&quot; (1903).

Peterson co-wrote &quot;Wild America&quot; with James Fisher, and edited or wrote many of the volumes in the Peterson Field Guide series. His contributions span a wide array of topics, from rocks and minerals to beetles and reptiles. He developed the Peterson Identification System and is known for the clarity of both his illustrations of field guides and his delineation of relevant field marks.

Paul R. Ehrlich, in &quot;The Birder&#x27;s Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds&quot; (Ehrlich et al 1988), said of Peterson:In this century, no one has done more to promote an interest in living creatures than Roger Tory Peterson, the inventor of the modern field guide.

Over the course of his lifetime, Peterson received many accolades, including the United States&#x27; Presidential Medal of Freedom. He was honored by the two Swedish District lodges of the Vasa Order of America, who selected him to be Swedish-American of the Year. He was twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and received 23 honorary doctorates.

Peterson died in 1996 at his home in Old Lyme, Connecticut. His remains were cremated, and his ashes were spread on and around Great Island near Old Lyme, under grave memorials in the Duck River Cemetery in Old Lyme, and in the Pine Hill Cemetery in Falconer, New York.

==Legacy, including the Roger Tory Peterson Institute of Natural History==
The Roger Tory Peterson Institute (RTPI) of Natural History in Jamestown, New York, launched in 1984, and ramped up its activity in 1986 with its hire of the first president, Dr. Harold D. Mahan. At that time, the institute&#x27;s primary mission was described as being &quot;to develop programs to increase the number of serious students of natural history&quot;. The institute&#x27;s official ribbon-cutting and dedication took place in 1993. The RTPI houses the largest collection of Peterson&#x27;s work. Its present mission and vision is stated as being to challenge visitors &quot;to confront environmental issues of regional, national and global concern&quot; and to be &quot;a living embodiment of the Peterson Field Guide&quot;.

In 1997, the Harvard Museum of Natural History established the Roger Tory Peterson Medal &quot;to keep alive the memory of the pioneering naturalist and author of the legendary &quot;Peterson Field Guide to Birds&quot;.” In 2000, the American Birding Association established the Roger Tory Peterson Award for Promoting the Cause of Birding. 

Three biographies about Peterson have been written. The first, a 1977 authorized biography by John Devlin and Grace Naismith, received mixed reviews. Two new biographies were published around the centenary of Peterson&#x27;s birth. Douglas Carlson&#x27;s &quot;Roger Tory Peterson: A Biography&quot; and Elizabeth Rosenthal&#x27;s &quot;Birdwatcher: The Life of Roger Tory Peterson&quot; (2008) were reviewed by Todd Engstrom in the journal of the American Ornithological Society, &quot;The Auk&quot;. In 2020, Peterson&#x27;s step-daughter from his third marriage, Linda Marie Westervelt, self-published &quot;Where Bluebirds Fly&quot;, a biographical memoir about the twenty year relationship between her mother, Virginia Marie Peterson and step-father.

<doc id="332897" wikidata="Q3052113" url="?curid=332897" title="Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University">
<text>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) is a private university focused on aviation and aerospace programs based in Daytona Beach, Florida, and Prescott, Arizona, United States. It is the largest accredited university system specializing in aviation and aerospace. It has numerous online programs and academic programs offered at satellite locations.

Founded at Lunken Field in Cincinnati in 1926, it began as a regional school for pilots and aircraft mechanics. With the expansion and development of aviation and related space programs, the university enrolls almost 31,000 undergraduate and graduate students.

==History==
On December 17, 1925, Talton Higbee Embry and John Paul Riddle founded the Embry–Riddle Company at Lunken Airport in Cincinnati, Ohio. In spring 1926, the company opened the Embry–Riddle School of Aviation. Following a merger with the Aviation Corporation (AVCO), the Embry–Riddle flying school was closed in 1930.

In 1939, Riddle, John Graham McKay and wife Isabel re-established the school in Miami. Keeping the name, they partnered with the University of Miami to provide flight training under the Civilian Pilot Training Program, and rapidly increase the number of qualified pilots immediately preceding World War II. Alumni of this school included John F. Kennedy, who served in the US Navy in the war, and was elected in 1960 as President of the United States. Following rapid expansion, the school took over the former Fritz Hotel.

Preempting the announced closure of Tamiami Airport, where the Embry–Riddle Aeronautical Institute was conducting its flight operations, the school was moved to Daytona Beach, Florida in April 1965. Embry–Riddle became a nonprofit in 1959.

Having expanded its programs of study, it was awarded university status in 1968. It took the name Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University in 1970. Embry–Riddle started its international program the same year. In 1978 it opened a second residential campus in Prescott, Arizona.

==Academics==
The non-profit university is accredited as a level VI institution by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award degrees at the associate, bachelor, master&#x27;s, and doctoral levels. The university&#x27;s programs in aviation maintenance, air traffic management, applied meteorology, aeronautical science, aerospace and occupational safety, flight operations, and airport management are accredited by the Aviation Accreditation Board International (AABI).

The bachelor and master&#x27;s programs in business are accredited by the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP). All engineering programs are accredited by ABET.

The programs in aeronautics, air traffic management, applied meteorology, and aerospace studies are certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In July 2014, the university became the nation&#x27;s first FAA-approved training provider for student airline certification.

===Professional programs===
ERAU hosts a variety of aviation-focused short-courses. These courses – ranging in topic from Unmanned Aircraft Systems to Aircraft Accident Investigation and Management – are tailored for professionals involved in the operations, management, and supervision of aviation organizations. The &quot;Worldwide campus&quot; offers courses either online, via video, or face-to-face globally.

The Embry–Riddle Prescott Campus is home to the Robertson Safety Institute (RSI); this is a center for research, development, short courses, and corporate outreach in safety education. The campus has resources including the Robertson Crash Lab, Aviation Safety and Security Archives, and access to advanced engineering, scientific, and forensic resources.

==Campuses==
===Daytona Beach, Florida===

Embry–Riddle&#x27;s oldest residential campus () and academic headquarters has been in Daytona Beach, Florida since 1965. Built adjacent to the Daytona Beach International Airport, the campus is connected to an aircraft ramp owned by the university for flight training. The main campus consists of an aviation complex, academic quad and residence halls surrounding the student center and Jack R. Hunt Aviator Park. The campus has seven residence halls and one off-campus housing complex. Athletic facilities, the Brigadier General William W. Spruance ROTC Center, and the ICI Center are on the east side of campus.

This university&#x27;s eastern campus serves 6,740 undergraduates and 781 graduate students from nearly 100 countries. All first-year students live on campus with sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Fifty-two majors are offered at this location for 2020–21. The engineering physics program at the Daytona Beach campus is among the largest undergraduate engineering physics program in the country and the only one specializing in aerospace.

The Daytona Beach campus has a fleet of 82 Cessna Skyhawks and 14 Diamond DA42-VI&#x27;s. The ERAU Flying Club&#x27;s two Cessna 172s and the three Cessna 150s of the Eagles Flight Team are also parked on the ramp.

Embry–Riddle&#x27;s Daytona Beach campus has one of the most extensive Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) programs in the United States and the nation&#x27;s largest Air Force ROTC program.

===Prescott, Arizona===

Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University&#x27;s campus in Prescott, Arizona opened in 1978. The campus is north of Phoenix. The campus has an enrollment of about 2,000 students and covers of western terrain.

The Prescott Campus features four academic colleges and offers 19 bachelor&#x27;s degrees and two master&#x27;s degrees, as well as educational programs for youths, students, and working professionals.

The Prescott campus offers the only Global Security and Intelligence Studies program in the US.

The First Year Experience program is designed to help students transition to college on academic, social, and educational levels. Students in FYE housing are grouped together by major, when possible, and reside with a staff that is specially trained to handle first-year transitional issues. All first-year students who have graduated high school within 12 months of matriculation are required to live in University housing for their first full academic year. Exceptions are made for students who are over 21 years old, are married or have a dependent, have a permanent address in Yavapai County at time of application to ERAU, or students who have lived on-campus at another institution of higher education for at least two semesters. FYE students reside in the Mingus Mountain Complex or the Thumb Butte Complex and are required to participate in the Dining Services meal program.

Embry–Riddle&#x27;s two Air Force ROTC detachments form the largest university-based Air Force commissioning source in the nation. Embry–Riddle&#x27;s AFROTC detachments also produce more commissioned officers, more pilots and other rated officers for the Air Force than any other institution in the nation except the Air Force Academy. Army ROTC also operates a large detachment on the Prescott Campus.

The Prescott campus is home to the Golden Eagles Flight Team, which competes in the National Intercollegiate Flying Association. Prescott&#x27;s Golden Eagles Flight Team has won the regional championship each year for the past 31 years, and the team is also thirteen-time National Champions winning in 1993, 1997, 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2022.

<text>An olympiad (, &quot;Olympiás&quot;) is a period of four years, particularly those associated with the ancient and modern Olympic Games.

Although the ancient Olympics were established during Greece&#x27;s Archaic Era, it was not until Hippias that a consistent list was established and not until Ephorus in the Hellenistic period that the first recorded Olympic contest was used as a calendar epoch. Ancient authors agreed that other Olympics had been held before the race won by Coroebus but disagreed on how many; the convention was established to place Coroebus&#x27;s victory at a time equivalent to the summer of 776 in the Proleptic Julian calendar, and to treat it as Year 1 of Olympiad 1. Olympiad 2 began with the next games in the summer of 772 .

Thus, for N less than 195, Olympiad N is reckoned as having started in the year formula_1  and ended four years later. For N greater than or equal to 195, Olympiad N began in  formula_2 and ended four years later. By extrapolation, the 1st year of the th Olympiad begins roughly around 2 August 2025.

In reference to the modern Olympics, their Olympiads are four year periods beginning on January 1 of the year of the Summer Games. Thus, the modern Olympiad I began 1 January 1896, Olympiad II began 1 January 1900, and so on. Olympiad XXXIII began 1 January 2024. Because the Julian and Gregorian calendars go directly from 1  to  1, the cycle of modern Olympiads is ahead of the ancient cycle by one year.

== Ancient Olympics ==
Each olympiad started with the holding of the games, which originally began on the first or second full moon after the summer solstice. After the introduction of the Metonic cycle about 432 BC, the start of the games was determined slightly differently. Within each olympiad, time was reckoned by referring to its 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th year. Ancient writers sometimes describe their Olympiads as lasting five years but do so by counting inclusively; in fact each comprised a four year period. For example, the first year of Olympiad 140 began in the summer of 220  and lasted until the middle of 219 . After the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years of Olympiad 140, the games in the summer of 216  would begin the first year of Olympiad 141.

=== Historians ===
The sophist Hippias was the first writer to compile a comprehensive list of the Olympic victors (, &quot;olympioníkes&quot;). Although his &quot;Olympic Record&quot; (, &quot;Olympionikō̂n Anagraphḗ&quot;) is now entirely lost, it apparently formed the basis of all later Olympic dating. By the time of Eratosthenes, his dating of Coroebus&#x27;s victory to 776  had been generally accepted. The panhellenic nature of the games, their regular schedule, and the improved victor list allowed Greek historians to use the Olympiads as a way of reckoning time that did not depend on the various calendars of the city-states. (See e.g. the Attic calendar of the Athenians.) The first to do so consistently was Timaeus of Tauromenium in the third century . Nevertheless, since for events of the early history of the games the reckoning was used in retrospect, some of the dates given by later historian for events before the 5th century  are very unreliable. In the 2nd century, Phlegon of Tralles summarized the events of each Olympiad in a book called &quot;Olympiads&quot;; fragments survive in the work of the Byzantine writer Photius. Christian chroniclers continued to use this Greek system of dating as a way of synchronizing biblical events with Greek and Roman history. In the 3rd century, Sextus Julius Africanus compiled a list of Olympic victors up to 217 , and this list has been preserved in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Eusebius.

=== Examples of Ancient Olympiad dates ===
* Early historians sometimes used the names of Olympic victors as a method of dating events to a specific year. For instance, Thucydides says in his account of the year 428 BC: &quot;It was the Olympiad in which the Rhodian Dorieus gained his second victory.&quot;
* Dionysius of Halicarnassus dates the foundation of Rome to the first year of the seventh Olympiad, 752 &amp; 751 . Since Rome was founded on April 21, which was in the last half of the ancient Olympic year, it would be 751  specifically. In Book 1 chapter 75 Dionysius states: &quot;...Romulus, the first ruler of the city, began his reign in the first year of the seventh Olympiad, when Charops at Athens was in the first year of his ten-year term as archon.&quot;
* Diodorus Siculus dates the Persian invasion of Greece to 480 : &quot;Calliades was archon in Athens, and the Romans made Spurius Cassius and Proculus Verginius Tricostus consuls, and the Eleians celebrated the Seventy-fifth Olympiad, that in which Astylus of Syracuse won the &quot;stadion&quot;. It was in this year that king Xerxes made his campaign against Greece.&quot;
* Jerome, in his Latin translation of the Chronicle of Eusebius, dates the birth of Jesus Christ to year 3 of Olympiad 194, the 42nd year of the reign of the emperor Augustus, which equates to the year 2 .

=== Anolympiad ===
Though the games were held without interruption, on more than one occasion they were held by others than the Eleians. The Eleians declared such games &quot;Anolympiads&quot; (non-Olympics), but it is assumed the winners were nevertheless recorded.

=== End of the era ===
During the 3rd century, records of the games are so scanty that historians are not certain whether after 261 they were still held every four years. Some winners were recorded though, until the 293rd and last Olympiad of  393. In 394, Roman Emperor Theodosius I outlawed the games at Olympia as pagan. Though it would have been possible to continue the reckoning by just counting four-year periods, by the middle of the 5th century reckoning by Olympiads had ceased.

== Modern Olympics ==

=== Start and end ===
The Summer Olympics are more correctly referred to as the Games of the Olympiad. The first poster to announce the games using this term was the one for the 1932 Summer Olympics, in Los Angeles, using the phrase: &quot;Call to the games of the Xth Olympiad&quot;.

The modern Olympiad is a period of four years: the first Olympiad started on 1 January 1896, and an Olympiad starts on 1 January of the years evenly divisible by four.

This means that the count of the Olympiads continues, even if Olympic Games are cancelled: For instance, the regular intervals would have meant (summer) Olympic Games should have occurred in 1940 and 1944, but both were cancelled due to World War II. 

Nonetheless, the count of the Olympiads continued: The 1936 Games were those of the XI Olympiad, while the next Summer Games were those of 1948, which were the Games of the XIV Olympiad. The current Olympiad is the XXXIII of the modern era, which began on 1 January 2024.

Note, however, that the official numbering of the Winter Olympics does not count Olympiads, it counts only the Games themselves. 

For example, the first Winter Games, in 1924, are not designated as &quot;Winter Games of the VII Olympiad&quot;, but as the &quot;I Winter Olympic Games&quot;. (The first Winter Games were termed as &quot;Olympic&quot; in a later year.)

The 1936 Summer Games were the &quot;Games of the XI Olympiad&quot;. After the 1940 and 1944 Summer Games were canceled due to World War II, the Games resumed in 1948 as the &quot;Games of the XIV Olympiad&quot;. However, the 1936 Winter Games were the &quot;IV Winter Olympic Games&quot;, and on the resumption of the Winter Games in 1948, the event was designated the &quot;V Winter Olympic Games&quot;.

The 2020 Summer Games were the &quot;Games of the XXXII Olympiad&quot;. On 24 March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was postponed to 2021 rather than cancelled, and thus becoming the first postponement in the 124-year history of the Olympics.

Some media people have from time to time referred to a particular (e.g., the &quot;n&quot;th) Winter Olympics as &quot;the Games of the &quot;n&quot;th Winter Olympiad&quot;, perhaps believing it to be the correct formal name for the Winter Games by analogy with that of the Summer Games. Indeed, at least one IOC-published article has applied this nomenclature as well. This analogy is sometimes extended further by media references to &quot;Summer Olympiads&quot;. 

However, the IOC does not seem to make an official distinction between Olympiads for the summer and winter games, and such usage, particularly for the Winter Olympics, is inconsistent with the numbering discussed above.

=== Quadrennium ===
Some Olympic Committees often use the term &quot;quadrennium&quot;, which they claim refers to the same four-year period. However, it indicates these quadrennia in calendar years, starting with the first year after the Summer Olympics and ending with the year the next Olympics are held. This would suggest a more precise period of four years, but, for example, the 2001–2004 Quadrennium would then not be exactly the same period as the XXVII Olympiad, which was 2000–2003.

=== Cultural Olympiad ===

A &quot;Cultural Olympiad&quot; is a concept protected by the International Olympic Committee and may be used only within the limits defined by an Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games. From one Games to the next, the scale of the Cultural Olympiad varies considerably, sometimes involving activity over the entire Olympiad and other times emphasizing specific periods within it. Baron Pierre de Coubertin established the principle of Olympic Art Competitions at a special congress in Paris in 1906, and the first official programme was presented during the 1912 Games in Stockholm. These competitions were also named the &quot;Pentathlon of the Muses&quot;, as their purpose was to bring artists to present their work and compete for &quot;art&quot; medals across five categories: architecture, music, literature, sculpture and painting.

Nowadays, while there are no competitions as such, cultural and artistic practice is displayed via the Cultural Olympiad. The 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver presented the Cultural Olympiad Digital Edition. The 2012 Olympics included an extensive Cultural Olympiad with the London 2012 Festival in the host city, and events elsewhere including the World Shakespeare Festival produced by the RSC. The 2016 games&#x27; Cultural Olympiad was scaled back due to Brazil&#x27;s recession; there was no published programme, with director Carla Camurati promising &quot;secret&quot; and &quot;spontaneous&quot; events such as flash mobs. Cultural events in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were planned before being canceled due to pandemic restrictions in Japan. Instead, an alternative virtual event was held.

== Other uses ==
The English term is still often used popularly to indicate the games themselves, a usage that is uncommon in ancient Greek (as an Olympiad is most often the time period &quot;between&quot; and including sets of games). It is also used to indicate international competitions other than physical sports. This includes international science olympiads, such as the International Geography Olympiad, International Mathematical Olympiad, International Forensics Olympiad, and the International Linguistics Olympiad and their associated national qualifying tests (e.g., the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad, the USA Forensics Olympiad or the United Kingdom Linguistics Olympiad), and also events in mind-sports, such as the Science Olympiad, Mindsport Olympiad, Chess Olympiad, International History Olympiad and Computer Olympiad. In these cases &quot;Olympiad&quot; is used to indicate a regular event of international competition for top achieving participants; it does not necessarily indicate a four-year period.

In some languages, like Czech and Slovak, Olympiad () is the correct term for the games.

&quot;The Olympiad&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Olimpiade&quot;) is also the name of some 60 operas set in Ancient Greece.

<text>An ornithopter (from Greek &quot;ornis, ornith-&quot; &#x27;bird&#x27; and &quot;pteron&quot; &#x27;wing&#x27;) is an aircraft that flies by flapping its wings. Designers sought to imitate the flapping-wing flight of birds, bats, and insects. Though machines may differ in form, they are usually built on the same scale as flying animals. Larger, crewed ornithopters have also been built and some have been successful. Crewed ornithopters are generally powered either by engines or by the pilot.

==Early history==
Some early crude flight attempts may have been intended to achieve flapping-wing flight, but probably only a glide was actually achieved. They include the purported flights of the 11th-century Catholic monk Eilmer of Malmesbury (recorded in the 12th century) and the 9th-century poet Abbas Ibn Firnas (recorded in the 17th century). Roger Bacon, writing in 1260, was also among the first to consider a technological means of flight. In 1485, Leonardo da Vinci began to study the flight of birds. He grasped that humans are too heavy, and not strong enough, to fly using wings simply attached to the arms. He, therefore, sketched a device in which the aviator lies down on a plank and works two large, membranous wings using hand levers, foot pedals, and a system of pulleys.
In 1841, an ironsmith &quot;kalfa&quot; (journeyman), Manojlo, who &quot;came to Belgrade from Vojvodina&quot;, attempted flying with a device described as an ornithopter (&quot;flapping wings like those of a bird&quot;). Refused by the authorities a permit to take off from the belfry of Saint Michael&#x27;s Cathedral, he clandestinely climbed to the rooftop of the Dumrukhana (import tax head office) and took off, landing in a heap of snow, and surviving.

The first ornithopters capable of flight were constructed in France. Jobert in 1871 used a rubber band to power a small model bird. Alphonse Pénaud, Abel Hureau de Villeneuve, and Victor Tatin also made rubber-powered ornithopters during the 1870s. Tatin&#x27;s ornithopter was perhaps the first to use active torsion of the wings, and apparently it served as the basis for a commercial toy offered by Pichancourt 1889. Gustave Trouvé was the first to use internal combustion, and his 1890 model flew a distance of 80 meters in a demonstration for the French Academy of Sciences. The wings were flapped by gunpowder charges activating a Bourdon tube.

From 1884 on, Lawrence Hargrave built scores of ornithopters powered by rubber bands, springs, steam, or compressed air. He introduced the use of small flapping wings providing the thrust for a larger fixed wing; this innovation eliminated the need for gear reduction, thereby simplifying the construction.
E. P. Frost made ornithopters starting in the 1870s; first models were powered by steam engines, then in the 1900s, an internal-combustion craft large enough for a person was built, though it did not fly.

In the 1930s, Alexander Lippisch and the National Socialist Flyers Corps of Nazi Germany constructed and successfully flew a series of internal combustion-powered ornithopters, using Hargrave&#x27;s concept of small flapping wings, but with aerodynamic improvements resulting from the methodical study.

Erich von Holst, also working in the 1930s, achieved great efficiency and realism in his work with ornithopters powered by rubber bands. He achieved perhaps the first success of an ornithopter with a bending wing, intended to imitate more closely the folding wing action of birds, although it was not a true variable-span wing such as those of birds.

Around 1960, Percival Spencer successfully flew a series of uncrewed ornithopters using internal combustion engines ranging from displacement, and having wingspans up to . In 1961, Percival Spencer and Jack Stephenson flew the first successful engine-powered, remotely piloted ornithopter, known as the Spencer Orniplane. The Orniplane had a wingspan, weighed , and was powered by a -displacement two-stroke engine. It had a biplane configuration, to reduce oscillation of the fuselage.

==Crewed flight==

Crewed ornithopters fall into two general categories: Those powered by the muscular effort of the pilot (human-powered ornithopters), and those powered by an engine.

Around 1894, Otto Lilienthal, an aviation pioneer, became famous in Germany for his widely publicized and successful glider flights. Lilienthal also studied bird flight and conducted some related experiments. He constructed an ornithopter, although its complete development was prevented by his untimely death on 9 August 1896 in a glider accident.

In 1929, a man-powered ornithopter designed by Alexander Lippisch (designer of the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet) flew a distance of after tow launch. Since a tow launch was used, some have questioned whether the aircraft was capable of flying on its own. Lippisch asserted that the aircraft was actually flying, not making an extended glide. (Precise measurement of altitude and velocity over time would be necessary to resolve this question.) Most of the subsequent human-powered ornithopters likewise used a tow launch, and flights were brief simply because human muscle power diminishes rapidly over time.

In 1942, Adalbert Schmid made a much longer flight of a human-powered ornithopter at Munich-Laim. It travelled a distance of , maintaining a height of throughout most of the flight. Later this same aircraft was fitted with a Sachs motorcycle engine. With the engine, it made flights up to 15 minutes in duration. Schmid later constructed a ornithopter, based on the Grunau-Baby IIa sailplane, which was flown in 1947. The second aircraft had flapping outer wing panels.

The French engineer René Riout devoted himself for three decades to the realization of flapping wing ornithopters. In 1905 he invented his first models. In 1909 he won the gold medal in the Lépine competition for a reduced model. In 1913 he worked on the development of a model ordered by a pilot, the Dubois-Riout. The tests were stopped in 1916. In 1937, he finalized the Riout 102T Alérion, certainly the most successful piloted flapping wing ornithopter until the second decade of the 21st century. Unfortunately, the conclusions of the wind tunnel tests were not favorable to the continuation of the project.
In 2005, Yves Rousseau was given the Paul Tissandier Diploma, awarded by the FAI for contributions to the field of aviation. Rousseau attempted his first human-muscle-powered flight with flapping wings in 1995. On 20 April 2006, at his 212th attempt, he succeeded in flying a distance of , observed by officials of the Aero Club de France. On his 213th flight attempt, a gust of wind led to a wing breaking up, causing the pilot to be gravely injured and rendered paraplegic.

A team at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies, headed by Professor James DeLaurier, worked for several years on an engine-powered, piloted ornithopter. In July 2006, at the Bombardier Airfield at Downsview Park in Toronto, Professor DeLaurier&#x27;s machine, the UTIAS Ornithopter No.1 made a jet-assisted takeoff and 14-second flight. According to DeLaurier, the jet was necessary for sustained flight, but the flapping wings did most of the work.

On August 2, 2010, Todd Reichert of the same institution piloted a human-powered ornithopter named Snowbird. The wingspan, aircraft was constructed from carbon fibre, balsa, and foam. The pilot sat in a small cockpit suspended below the wings and pumped a bar with his feet to operate a system of wires that flapped the wings up and down. Towed by a car until airborne, it then sustained flight for almost 20 seconds. It flew with an average speed of . Similar tow-launched flights were made in the past, but improved data collection verified that the ornithopter was capable of self-powered flight once aloft.

== Applications for uncrewed ornithopters ==
Because ornithopters can be made to resemble birds or insects, they could be used for military applications such as aerial reconnaissance without alerting the enemies that they are under surveillance. Several ornithopters have been flown with video cameras on board, some of which can hover and maneuver in small spaces. In 2011, AeroVironment demonstrated a remotely piloted ornithopter resembling a large hummingbird for possible spy missions.

Led by Paul B. MacCready (of Gossamer Albatross fame), AeroVironment developed a half-scale radio-controlled model of the giant pterosaur, &quot;Quetzalcoatlus northropi&quot;, for the Smithsonian Institution in the mid-1980s. It was built to star in the IMAX movie &quot;On the Wing&quot;. The model had a wingspan and featured a complex computerized autopilot control system, just as the full-sized pterosaur relied on its neuromuscular system to make constant adjustments in flight.

Researchers hope to eliminate the motors and gears of current designs by more closely imitating animal flight muscles. Georgia Tech Research Institute&#x27;s Robert C. Michelson is developing a reciprocating chemical muscle for use in microscale flapping-wing aircraft. Michelson uses the term &quot;entomopter&quot; for this type of ornithopter. SRI International is developing polymer artificial muscles that may also be used for flapping-wing flight.

In 2002, Krister Wolff and Peter Nordin of Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, built a flapping-wing robot that learned flight techniques. The balsa-wood design was driven by machine learning software technology known as a steady-state linear evolutionary algorithm. Inspired by natural evolution, the software &quot;evolves&quot; in response to feedback on how well it performs a given task. Although confined to a laboratory apparatus, their ornithopter evolved behavior for maximum sustained lift force and horizontal movement.

Since 2002, Prof. Theo van Holten has been working on an ornithopter that is constructed like a helicopter. The device is called the &quot;ornicopter&quot; and was made by constructing the main rotor so that it would have no reaction torque.

In 2008, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol started using a realistic-looking mechanical hawk designed by falconer Robert Musters. The radio-controlled robot bird is used to scare away birds that could damage the engines of airplanes.

In 2012, RoBird (formerly Clear Flight Solutions), a spin-off of the University of Twente, started making artificial birds of prey (called RoBird®) for airports and agricultural and waste-management industries.

Adrian Thomas and Alex Caccia founded Animal Dynamics Ltd in 2015, to develop a mechanical analogue of dragonflies to be used as a drone that will outperform quadcopters. The work is funded by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, the research arm of the British Ministry of Defence, and the United States Air Force.

==Hobby==
Hobbyists build and fly their own ornithopters. These range from light-weight models powered by rubber bands, to larger models with radio control.

The rubber-band-powered model can be fairly simple in design and construction. Hobbyists compete for the longest flight times with these models. An introductory model can be fairly simple in design and construction, but the advanced competition designs are extremely delicate and challenging to build. Roy White holds the United States national record for indoor rubber-powered, with his flight time of 21 minutes, 44 seconds.

Commercial free-flight rubber-band-powered toy ornithopters have long been available. The first of these was sold under the name &quot;Tim Bird&quot; in Paris in 1879. Later models were also sold as Tim Bird (made by G de Ruymbeke, France, since 1969).

Commercial radio-controlled designs stem from Percival Spencer&#x27;s engine-powered Seagulls, developed circa 1958, and Sean Kinkade&#x27;s work in the late 1990s to present day. The wings are usually driven by an electric motor. Many hobbyists enjoy experimenting with their own new wing designs and mechanisms. The opportunity to interact with real birds in their own domain also adds great enjoyment to this hobby. Birds are often curious and will follow or investigate the model while it is flying. In a few cases, RC birds have been attacked by birds of prey, crows, and even cats. More recent cheaper models such as the Dragonfly from WowWee have extended the market from dedicated hobbyists to the general toy market.

Some helpful resources for hobbyists include The Ornithopter Design Manual, book written by Nathan Chronister, and The Ornithopter Zone web site, which includes a large amount of information about building and flying these models.

Ornithopters were also of interest as the subject of one of the former events in the American nationwide Science Olympiad event list. The event (&quot;Flying Bird&quot;) entailed building a self-propelled ornithopter to exacting specifications, with points awarded for high flight time and low weight. Bonus points were also awarded if the ornithopter happened to look like a real bird.

==Aerodynamics==
As demonstrated by birds, flapping wings offer potential advantages in maneuverability and energy savings compared with fixed-wing aircraft, as well as potentially vertical take-off and landing. It has been suggested that these advantages are greatest at small sizes and low flying speeds, but the development of comprehensive aerodynamic theory for flapping remains an outstanding problem due to the complex non-linear nature of such unsteady separating flows.

Unlike airplanes and helicopters, the driving airfoils of the ornithopter have a flapping or oscillating motion, instead of rotary. As with helicopters, the wings usually have a combined function of providing both lift and thrust. Theoretically, the flapping wing can be set to zero angle of attack on the upstroke, so it passes easily through the air. Since typically the flapping airfoils produce both lift and thrust, drag-inducing structures are minimized. These two advantages potentially allow a high degree of efficiency.

===Wing design===
If future crewed motorized ornithopters cease to be &quot;exotic&quot;, imaginary, unreal aircraft and start to serve humans as junior members of the aircraft family, designers and engineers will need to solve not only wing design problems but many other problems involved in making them safe and reliable aircraft. Some of these problems, such as stability, controllability, and durability, are necessary for all aircraft. Other problems specific to ornithopters will appear; optimizing flapping-wing design is only one of them.

An effective ornithopter must have wings capable of generating both thrust, the force that propels the craft forward, and lift, the force (perpendicular to the direction of flight) that keeps the craft airborne. These forces must be strong enough to counter the effects of drag and the weight of the craft.

Leonardo&#x27;s ornithopter designs were inspired by his study of birds, and conceived the use of flapping motion to generate thrust and provide the forward motion necessary for aerodynamic lift. However, using materials available at that time the craft would be too heavy and require too much energy to produce sufficient lift or thrust for flight. Alphonse Pénaud introduced the idea of a powered ornithopter in 1874. His design had limited power and was uncontrollable, causing it to be transformed into a toy for children. More recent vehicles, such as the human-powered ornithopters of Lippisch (1929) and Emiel Hartman (1959), were capable powered gliders but required a towing vehicle in order to take off and may not have been capable of generating sufficient lift for sustained flight. Hartman&#x27;s ornithopter lacked the theoretical background of others based on the study of winged flight, but exemplified the idea of an ornithopter as a birdlike machine rather than a machine that directly copies birds&#x27; method of flight. The 1960s saw powered uncrewed ornithopters of various sizes capable of achieving and sustaining flight, providing valuable real-world examples of mechanical winged flight. In 1991, Harris and DeLaurier flew the first successful engine-powered remotely piloted ornithopter in Toronto, Canada. In 1999, a piloted ornithopter based on this design flew, capable of taking off from level pavement and executing sustained flight.

An ornithopter&#x27;s flapping wings and their motion through the air are designed to maximize the amount of lift generated within limits of weight, material strength and mechanical complexity. A flexible wing material can increase efficiency while keeping the driving mechanism simple. In wing designs with the spar sufficiently forward of the airfoil that the aerodynamic center is aft of the elastic axis of the wing, aeroelastic deformation causes the wing to move in a manner close to its ideal efficiency (in which pitching angles lag plunging displacements by approximately 90 degrees.) Flapping wings increase drag and are not as efficient as propeller-powered aircraft. Some designs achieve increased efficiency by applying more power on the down stroke than on the upstroke, as do most birds.

In order to achieve the desired flexibility and minimum weight, engineers and researchers have experimented with wings that require carbon fiber, plywood, fabric, and ribs, with a stiff, strong trailing edge. Any mass located aft of the empennage reduces the wing&#x27;s performance, so lightweight materials and empty space are used where possible. To minimize drag and maintain the desired shape, choice of a material for the wing surface is also important. In DeLaurier&#x27;s experiments, a smooth aerodynamic surface with a double-surface airfoil is more efficient at producing lift than a single-surface airfoil.

Other ornithopters do not necessarily act like birds or bats in flight. Typically birds and bats have thin and cambered wings to produce lift and thrust. Ornithopters with thinner wings have a limited angle of attack but provide optimum minimum-drag performance for a single lift coefficient.

Although hummingbirds fly with fully extended wings, such flight is not feasible for an ornithopter. If an ornithopter wing were to fully extend and twist and flap in small movements it would cause a stall, and if it were to twist and flap in very large motions, it would act like a windmill causing an inefficient flying situation.

A team of engineers and researchers called &quot;Fullwing&quot; has created an ornithopter that has an average lift of over 8 pounds, an average thrust of 0.88 pounds, and a propulsive efficiency of 54%. The wings were tested in a low-speed wind tunnel measuring the aerodynamic performance, showing that the higher the frequency of the wing beat, the higher the average thrust of the ornithopter.

== In fiction ==
Ornithopters have been depicted in fiction several times, including Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; series, where they are the primary form of air transportation used by House Atreides in the desert climate of the planet Arrakis.

<text>Bess Myerson (July 16, 1924 – December 14, 2014) was an American politician, model, and television actress who in 1945 became the first Jewish Miss America. Her achievement, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, was seen as an affirmation of the Jewish place in American life. She was a heroine to parts of the Jewish community, where &quot;she was the most famous pretty girl since Queen Esther&quot;.

Myerson made frequent television appearances during the 1950s and 1960s. She was a commissioner in the New York City government, served on presidential commissions from the 1960s through the 1980s, and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. Her career in public service ended in the late 1980s when she was indicted on bribery and conspiracy charges. She was acquitted after a highly publicized trial.

==Biography==
Myerson was born in the Bronx, New York, to Louis Myerson and Bella (née Podell), who were Jewish immigrants from Russia. Myerson&#x27;s father worked as a housepainter, handyman and carpenter. After Myerson&#x27;s birth, the family moved from the South Bronx to Shalom Aleichem Houses, a cooperative apartment complex in the northern Bronx. She had three siblings: a younger sister, Helen; an elder sister, Sylvia; and a brother, Joseph, who died at age 3, before Myerson was born.

Bess&#x27;s upbringing emphasized the importance of scholarship over physical beauty. In addition to tradesmen, her neighbors included poets, writers and artists. Myerson reached her adult height when she was 12, and she towered over other children, something that she said made her feel &quot;awkward and gawky&quot; during her preadolescence. Myerson recalled one of her worst childhood memories was playing the tall and thin &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoon character Olive Oyl in an elementary school play.

Myerson began studying piano when she was 9 years old and was in the second class of New York&#x27;s High School of Music and Art in 1937, graduating in 1941. She went to Hunter College, graduating with honors in 1945 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in music. To support herself and her family while in college, she gave piano lessons for fifty cents an hour, and worked as a music counselor at a girl&#x27;s summer camp in Vermont.

===Miss America===
By the time she was 21, Myerson was tall with &quot;luxuriant brown hair&quot;. Myerson was entered without her knowledge into the Miss New York City competition by John C. Pape, a retired steel magnate and amateur photographer who had employed her as a model while she was in college. When Myerson was told about the pageant by her sister Sylvia, who was acquainted with Pape, Myerson was angry because she felt that the beauty business was &quot;embarrassing&quot;. However, she was persuaded to compete by Sylvia, and she competed in the swimsuit competition using a borrowed bathing suit.

Myerson enjoyed competing in the pageant, in which she stood out from the other contestants because of her height. On August 15, 1945, the day of Japan&#x27;s surrender (VJ Day), she won the competition for the pageant and moved on to the Miss America competition, partly motivated by the $5,000 scholarship awarded to the winner. She told interviewers that she wanted to buy a black Steinway grand piano with the scholarship money.

Myerson was the Miss New York entry in the 1945 Miss America pageant, and she competed in the talent portion of the contest by performing the music of Edvard Grieg and George Gershwin. Prior to the competition, she was pressured to use a pseudonym that &quot;sounded less Jewish&quot;. Despite revelations of the Holocaust in the previous months, America was still widely perceived as an Anglo-Saxon Protestant society that manifested hostility toward people of Jewish ancestry. Myerson refused and was subjected to substantial antisemitism. After she won the title on September 8, 1945, three of the pageant&#x27;s five sponsors withdrew from having her represent their companies as Miss America.
She paid for graduate studies at Juilliard and Columbia University with the pageant scholarship money. An aspiring pianist, she briefly gave recitals on the vaudeville circuit before realizing that audiences were more interested in seeing her in a bathing suit. In 1946, she played in a Carnegie Hall popular music concert with members of the New York Philharmonic.

While Myerson was on her year-long tour as Miss America, she encountered &quot;No Jews&quot; signs posted in places such as hotels and country clubs. Such experiences led her to conduct lectures on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League titled &quot;You Can&#x27;t Be Beautiful and Hate&quot;. Myerson became a vocal opponent of antisemitism and racism, and her speaking tour became the highlight of her Miss America reign.

In 2015, Religion News Service observed that at the time when she won the pageant, emaciated concentration camp survivors had just shed their prison clothes. &quot;Bess Myerson represented the resurrection of the Jewish body—the journey from degradation to beauty.&quot;

===Television and politics===

A few years after hearing her speak at an ADL function, television producer Walt Framer hired Myerson for the 1950s game show &quot;The Big Payoff&quot;. She was the &quot;Lady in Mink&quot; modeling the grand prize mink coat, and introducing guests and prizes, throughout the 1951 to 1959 network run of the program. Recognized for her wit and hard work, in 1954 Myerson was a panelist on the game show &quot;The Name&#x27;s the Same&quot; and from 1958 through 1967 a panelist on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. She regularly substituted for Dave Garroway on the &quot;Today Show&quot;. She was also a host of the television broadcast of the Miss America pageant from 1954 to 1968.

Myerson stepped down from her other commitments in 1969 when appointed by Mayor John V. Lindsay to become the first Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs. Her career as a commercial pitchwoman for a number of products throughout the 1950s and 1960s had led to her becoming a consultant to several consumer products companies. In her consumer affairs position, which she held until 1973, she became a pioneer in consumer protection law.

She also served on several presidential commissions on violence, mental health, workplace issues and hunger in the 1960s and 1970s. Myerson was a frequent public companion of then-Congressman Ed Koch throughout the late 1970s and the beginning of his mayoral ambitions, and chaired his successful 1977 campaign for New York City mayor.

In the 1980 United States Senate election, Myerson vied for the Democratic nomination in New York against Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman, Queens District Attorney John J. Santucci, and Lindsay. Myerson lost to Holtzman by a wide margin. Holtzman was subsequently defeated by Al D&#x27;Amato.

In 2002, Myerson appeared in the documentary film &quot;Miss America&quot; as a former Miss America interviewee.

===The &quot;Bess Mess&quot;===
After serving in the Koch administration in 1983 as Commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs, Myerson&#x27;s career became overshadowed by controversy. She became romantically involved with a married sewer contractor, Carl Andrew Capasso. It soon emerged that Hortense Gabel—the judge involved in Capasso&#x27;s divorce case—had started socializing with Myerson. Judge Gabel&#x27;s daughter (Sukhreet) was also hired by Myerson. After Gabel cut Capasso&#x27;s child support payments, investigations began as to whether Gabel had been bribed. In April 1987, after Myerson invoked the Fifth Amendment, she was forced to resign her position in the Koch administration. The scandal became known as the &quot;Bess Mess&quot;.

Myerson, Capasso and Gabel were indicted a year later and tried on federal charges of conspiracy, mail fraud, obstruction of justice, and using interstate facilities to violate state bribery laws, accused of conspiring to reduce Capasso&#x27;s child support payments. With Sukhreet as the prosecution&#x27;s chief witness, the main issue at the U.S. District Court trial was whether Myerson&#x27;s decision to hire Sukhreet constituted bribery. After four months of trial proceedings, all three defendants were acquitted. Capasso remained in prison, having previously been convicted of unrelated tax charges.

===Personal life===
In October 1946, Myerson married Allan Wayne, a recently discharged U.S. Navy captain. They had one daughter, Barbara, born in 1947. The marriage was marred by domestic violence, and the couple divorced after eleven years. Myerson&#x27;s second marriage was to attorney Arnold Grant, who legally adopted her daughter in 1962. The couple divorced in the early 1970s. Daughter Barbara became an actress, director and screenwriter who is better known as Barra Grant.

Before her federal trial began, Myerson was arrested in May 1988 for shoplifting at a department store in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. She pleaded guilty to retail theft and was ordered to pay a fine.

Myerson was very connected to her Jewish roots, and was filmed in conversation with the Lubavitcher Rebbe. She donated funds to help build &quot;Bessie&#x27;s Bistro&quot; at the Jewish Museum of Florida-FIU in memory of her parents Bella and Louis Myerson, who lived in the neighborhood near the Museum. 

Myerson survived ovarian cancer in the 1970s and experienced a mild stroke in 1981, from which she made a full recovery. She moved to Florida in 2002, and later moved to California, where she remained until her death. In 2013, she was reported to be suffering from dementia.

===Death===
Myerson died on December 14, 2014, in Santa Monica, California, at age 90. Her death was not immediately announced publicly, but it was confirmed by the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s Office three weeks after she died. She was interred at Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery in Santa Monica.

<text>The is a series of mountain ranges in Japan which bisect the main island of Honshu. The peaks that tower over central Honshu have long been the object of veneration and pilgrimage. These mountains had long been exploited by local people for raw materials, including timber, fuel, fertilizer, fodder, meat, minerals, and medicines. Most visitors came to the mountain for pilgrimage, especially to the Buddhist temple and the sacred peak of Mount Tate.

The name was coined by English archaeologist William Gowland, and later popularized by Reverend Walter Weston (1861–1940), an English missionary for whom a memorial plaque is located at Kamikōchi, a tourist destination known for its alpine climate. When Gowland coined the phrase, he was only referring to the Hida Mountains, but it now also applies to the Kiso Mountains and Akaishi Mountains.
== History ==
The Japanese Alps has a long history before William Gowland established this name. The Japanese Alps have been used as a place of ascetic practice for Buddhists monks and &quot;Shugenja&quot; since ancient times. From the 1600s to the 1800s, samurai officers of the Kaga domain travelled deep into the Hida Mountains with local hunters and farmers as guides to preserve the timber of the mountains and continued to create maps recording ridges, valleys and vegetation. This survey is called &quot;Okuyama-mawari&quot; (奥山廻り). 

Even now, it is very difficult to cross the steep Hida mountains, one of the world&#x27;s heaviest snowfall areas, in winter. Therefore, it is considered a historical event in Japan that in the winter of 1584, &quot;daimyō&quot; Sassa Narimasa&#x27;s forces crossed over the mountain range over Zara Pass and Harinoki Pass. This event is called &quot;Sarasara-goe&quot; (さらさら越え) derived from Sassa and Zara Pass.

However, these Hida Mountains surveys did not seem to have been inherited by modern Japanese mountaineers who trekked through the mountains as a sport. As Kojima Usui later recalled, “in those days... no one knew even the names of the mountains, much less their locations or elevations. To go mountaineering was literally to strike out into the unknown country.”

The first modern geological survey sheets were issued in 1890. The report mentioned major peaks, but the topography was mostly guesswork. From 1891, foreign travelers were able to find useful information in Basil Hall Chamberlain and W.B. Mason&#x27;s &quot;Handbook for Travellers in Japan&quot;. However, for decades, the Japanese were climbing these mountains without a comparable guidebook. Japanese people did physical exploration over a decade in the 1890s. They divided the mountains into (north, central, and south) depending on how they were conventionally grouped. William Gowland, an English geologist, first thought of this swath of terrain as forming a single coherent landscape, comparable to the European Alps. Gowland&#x27;s view was further developed by another Englishman and Christian missionary, Walter Weston, who was able “to canonize Gowland&#x27;s geographical conception, deploying it as a de facto proper noun”. 

Gowland explored several parts of the ranges in the 1860s, being the first documented foreigner to climb two peaks in the Alps, Mount Yari and Mount Norikura. Gowland was an archaeologist, and he explored these ranges for archaeological reasons. While Gowland was the first foreigner to explore the ranges, Reverend Walter Weston, a Christian missionary, was the first foreigner to document his experiences.

About twenty years after Gowland&#x27;s explorations, Weston explored the ranges himself with Gowland&#x27;s notes on his explorations. Weston was led up many mountains by Kamijō kamonji, a mountain guide living in Kamikōchi. Weston explored the same ranges that Gowland previously traversed, and ascended the Mount Shirouma, Mount Jōnen, Mount Kasa, Mount Hotaka, and other minor mountains.

Weston first documented the two main mountain systems distinguishable by geological structure. The first of these he called the &quot;China system&quot; due to its connection with southeast China from just south of the Japanese archipelago. The second was called the &quot;Karafuto system&quot;, due to the fact that it enters Japan from Karafuto to the north and runs southwest. These two were considered to be the first western explorers of the range, and as a result Weston, with the help of Gowland, popularized and documented different parts of the ranges in an incredibly in-depth manner for others to expand on.

In 1907, Yoshitaro Shibasaki and others succeeded in climbing Mount Tsurugi, which is said to be the last unexplored peak in Japan and the most difficult to climb. On this occasion, they found the ornaments of a metal &quot;shugenja&quot; cane and a sword on the top of the mountain. A scientific investigation later confirmed that the ornaments of the cane and the sword were from the late Nara period to the early Heian period. It turned out that Mount Tsurugi had already been climbed by &quot;shugenja&quot; more than 1,000 years ago.

From the 1960s to the 1970s, the transportation infrastructure of the Japanese Alps was improved, and access to some popular mountain areas became dramatically easier, increasing not only climbers but also tourists. The Komagatake Ropeway opened in 1967, the Shinhotaka Ropeway opened in 1970, and the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route fully opened in 1971.

== Ranges ==
Today, the Japanese Alps encompass the Hida Mountains (飛騨山脈), the Kiso Mountains (木曽山脈) and the Akaishi Mountains (赤石山脈). These towering ranges include several peaks exceeding in height, the tallest after Mount Fuji. The highest are Mount Hotaka at in north area and Mount Kita at in south area. Since Mount Ontake is far from the Hida Mountains, it is generally not included in the Hida Mountains, but it is often mentioned together with the Japanese Alps in mountain guidebooks. Mount Ontake is well known as an active volcano, having erupted most recently in 2014.

===Northern Alps===
The Northern Alps, also known as the Hida Mountains, stretch through Nagano, Toyama and Gifu prefectures. A small portion of the mountains also reach into Niigata Prefecture. It includes the mountains Mount Norikura, Mount Yake, Mount Kasa, Mount Hotaka, Mount Yari, Mount Jōnen, Mount Washiba, Mount Suisho, Mount Yakushi, Mount Kurobegorō, Mount Tate, Mount Tsurugi, Kashima Yarigatake (鹿島槍ヶ岳), Goryū dake (五竜岳), Mount Shirouma, etc.

===Central Alps===
The Central Alps, also known as the Kiso Mountains, are located in the Nagano prefecture. It includes the mountains Mount Ena, Anpaiji mountain (安平路山), Mount Kusumoyama (越百山), Mount Minamikoma, Mount Utsugi, Mount Hōken, Mount Kisokoma, Kyogatake (経ヶ岳), etc.

===Southern Alps===
The Southern Alps, also known as the Akaishi Mountains, span Nagano, Yamanashi, and Shizuoka prefectures. It includes the mountains Mount Tekari, Mount Hijiri, Mount Akaishi, Mount Arakawa, Mount Shiomi, Mount Nōtori, Mount Aino, Mount Kita, Mount Hōō, Mount Kaikoma, Mount Senjō, Mount Nokogiri (Akaishi), etc.
==Glaciers==
Geographers previously believed that no active glaciers existed in Japan. The Japanese Society of Snow and Ice found this to be false in May 2012. By studying surface flow velocity and snow patches in Mount Tsurugi, they found that certain perennial snow patches have large masses of ice, upwards of 30 meters in thickness. This causes these snow patches to be classified as active glaciers, and as of 2019 there are seven active glaciers in the Japanese Alps, and all of Japan.

<text>Eber (; ; ) is an ancestor of the Ishmaelites and the Israelites according to the Generations of Noah in the Book of Genesis () and the Books of Chronicles ().

== Lineage ==
Eber (Hebrew: Ever) was a great-grandson of Noah&#x27;s son Shem and the father of Peleg, born when Eber was 34 years old, and of Joktan. He was the son of Shelah, a distant ancestor of Abraham. According to the Hebrew Bible, Eber died at the age of 464.
In the Septuagint, the name is written as Heber/Eber (), and his father is called Sala (). His son is called Phaleg/Phalek (), born when Heber was 34 years old, and he had other sons and daughters. Heber lived to an age of 464 years.

== Name ==

The triliteral root , , is connected with crossing over and the beyond. Considering that other names for descendants of Shem also stand for places, Eber can also be considered the name of an area, perhaps near Assyria.

Medieval scholars such as Michael the Syrian, Bar Hebraeus, and Agapius of Hierapolis noted that the prevailing view was the Hebrews (, also derived from the letters ) had received their name from ʿEber, while others state the name &quot;Hebrew&quot; means &quot;those who cross&quot;, a reference to those who crossed the Euphrates with Abram from Ur of the Chaldees to Harran and then Canaan.

In some translations of the New Testament, he is referred to once as Heber/Eber (Luke 3:35, &quot;] the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Heber, the son of Selah&quot;) but should not be confused with Ḥeber, the grandson of Asher, who is mentioned in Genesis 46:17 and in Numbers 26:45, as their names are distinct in Hebrew; Ḥeber is with a heth while ʿEber has an ayin.

== Hebrew ==

The 13th-century Muslim historian Abu al-Fida relates a story noting that the patriarch Eber, the great-grandson of Shem, refused to help with the building of the Tower of Babel. As a result, his language was not confused when the tower was abandoned. He and his family alone retained the original Adamic language, which he identified as Hebrew, a language named after ʿEber.

==In Islam==

ʿEber is sometimes referred to in classical Islamic writings as the &quot;father&quot; of the &quot;prehistoric, original Arabs&quot; (the &quot;ʿArab al-ʿĀriba&quot;), who lived in the Arabian Peninsula after the Deluge. ʿEber was also identified with the Muslim prophet Hud by some of the early Muslim authorities, who has a surah named after him in the Quran. Other sources identify the prophet Hud as ʿEber&#x27;s son.

<doc id="332949" wikidata="Q330752" url="?curid=332949" title="Abraham Zapruder">
<text>Abraham Zapruder (May 15, 1905 – August 30, 1970) was a Ukrainian-born American clothing manufacturer who witnessed the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. He unexpectedly captured the shooting in a home movie while filming the presidential limousine and motorcade as it traveled through Dealey Plaza. The Zapruder film is regarded as the most complete footage of the assassination.

==Early life==
Zapruder was born into a Jewish family in the city of Kovel, the Russian Empire (now Ukraine), the son of Israel Zapruder. He received only four years of formal education in Ukraine. In 1909, his father left for North America. In 1918, Abraham Zapruder left Kovel for Warsaw with his family. In 1920, his family emigrated to the United States, settling in Brooklyn, New York where they were reunited with Israel Zapruder.

Studying English at night, he found work as a clothing pattern maker in Manhattan&#x27;s garment district. In 1933, he married Lillian Sapovnik (1913–1993); they went on to have two children. Zapruder was a Freemason and an Inspector-General (33rd degree) of the Scottish Rite.

In 1941, Zapruder moved to Dallas, Texas, to work for Nardis, a local sportswear company. In 1949, he co-founded Jennifer Juniors, Inc., producing the Chalet and Jennifer Juniors brands of dresses. His Jennifer Juniors offices were on the fourth floor of the Dal-Tex Building, across the street from the Texas School Book Depository.

==Witness to Kennedy assassination==

===Filming of assassination===
At the time of the assassination, Zapruder was an admirer of President Kennedy and considered himself a Democrat. Zapruder had originally planned to film the motorcade carrying President Kennedy through downtown Dallas on November 22, but he decided not to because it had been raining that morning. When he arrived at work that morning without his camera, Zapruder&#x27;s assistant insisted that he retrieve it from home before going to Dealey Plaza because the weather had cleared.

Zapruder&#x27;s movie camera was an 8 mm Bell &amp; Howell Zoomatic Director Series Model 414 PD—top-of-the-line when it was purchased in 1962. Zapruder had planned to film the motorcade from his office window but opted for a better spot in Dealey Plaza where the motorcade would be passing. He stood atop a concrete abutment extending from the John Neely Bryan concrete pergola on the grassy knoll north of Elm Street on the opposite side of the Texas School Book Depository to the north in Dealey Plaza. Zapruder&#x27;s secretary, Marilyn Sitzman, offered to assist Zapruder as he had vertigo and was apprehensive about standing even at a small height of a few feet alone.

While Sitzman stood behind Zapruder and held his coat to steady him, he began shooting the presidential motorcade as it turned from Houston Street onto Elm Street in front of the Book Depository. Zapruder&#x27;s film captured 26.6 seconds of the traveling motorcade carrying President Kennedy on 486 frames of Kodak Kodachrome II safety film. It famously captured the fatal head shot that struck President Kennedy as his limousine passed almost directly in front of Zapruder and Sitzman&#x27;s position, from the center of Elm Street.

Zapruder later recalled that he immediately knew that President Kennedy&#x27;s wound was fatal as he saw the president&#x27;s head &quot;...explode like a firecracker.&quot; Walking back to his office amid the confusion following the shots, Zapruder encountered &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; reporter Harry McCormick, who had been standing near Zapruder and had noticed he was filming the motorcade. McCormick was acquainted with Agent Forrest Sorrels of the Secret Service&#x27;s Dallas office, and offered to bring Sorrels to Zapruder&#x27;s office. Zapruder agreed and returned to his office. McCormick later found Sorrels outside the Sheriff&#x27;s office at Main and Houston, and together they went to Zapruder&#x27;s office.

Zapruder agreed to give the film to Sorrels on the condition it would be used only for investigation of the assassination. The three then took the film to the television station WFAA intending to have it be developed. After it was realized that WFAA was unable to do so, the film was taken to Eastman Kodak&#x27;s Dallas processing plant later that afternoon, where it was developed around 6:30 p.m. As the Kodachrome process requires different equipment for duplication than development, the original print was taken to the Jamieson Film Company, where three additional copies were made; these were returned to Kodak around 8 p.m. for processing. Zapruder kept the original, plus one copy, and gave the other two copies to Sorrels, who sent them to Secret Service headquarters in Washington.

===Television interview===
While at WFAA, Zapruder described on live television the assassination of President Kennedy:


===Sale of rights===
Late that evening, Zapruder was contacted at home by Richard Stolley, an editor at &quot;Life&quot; magazine (and first editor of the future &quot;People&quot; magazine). They arranged to meet the following morning to view the film, after which Zapruder sold the print rights to &quot;Life&quot; for $50,000. Stolley was representing Time/Life on behalf of publisher Charles Douglas Jackson.

The following day (November 24), &quot;Life&quot; purchased all rights to the film for a total of $150,000 (approximately $ today).

The night after the assassination, Zapruder said that he had a nightmare in which he saw a booth in Times Square advertising &quot;See the President&#x27;s head explode!&quot; He determined that, while he was willing to make money from the film, he did not want the public to see the full horror of what he had seen. Therefore, a condition of the sale to &quot;Life&quot; was that frame 313, showing the fatal shot, would be withheld from the public. Although he made a profit from selling the film, he asked that the amount he was paid not be publicly disclosed. He later donated $25,000 (about $ today) of the money he was paid to the widow of Officer J. D. Tippit, a Dallas police officer who was shot and killed by Lee Harvey Oswald 45 minutes after President Kennedy was killed.

In 1975, Time, Inc. (which owned &quot;Life&quot; magazine) sold the film back to the Zapruder family for $1. In 1978, the Zapruders allowed the film to be stored at the National Archives and Records Administration where it remains. In 1999, the Zapruders donated the copyright of the film to the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza.

===Testimony===
In his testimony to the Warren Commission, Zapruder was asked for his impression regarding the direction of the shots by assistant Commission counsel Wesley Liebeler:

Zapruder added that he had assumed the shots came from behind him because the President&#x27;s head went backwards from the fatal shot, and also that the wound on the side of the President&#x27;s head was facing that direction. He also said he believed it was because police officers ran to the area behind him.

He broke down and wept as he recalled the assassination, and did so again at the 1969 trial of Clay Shaw.

==Death==
Zapruder died of stomach cancer in Dallas on August 30, 1970, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, the same hospital where Kennedy, Oswald and later Jack Ruby, who killed Oswald, died; he was later buried in the Emanu-El Cemetery in Dallas.

<doc id="332950" wikidata="Q6673775" url="?curid=332950" title="Longevity myths">
<text>Longevity myths are traditions about long-lived people (generally supercentenarians), either as individuals or groups of people, and practices that have been believed to confer longevity, but which current scientific evidence does not support, nor the reasons for the claims. While literal interpretations of such myths may appear to indicate extraordinarily long lifespans, experts believe such figures may be the result of incorrect translations of number systems through various languages, coupled along with the cultural and symbolic significance of certain numbers.

The phrase &quot;longevity tradition&quot; may include &quot;purifications, rituals, longevity practices, meditations, and alchemy&quot; that have been believed to confer greater human longevity, especially in Chinese culture.

Modern science indicates various ways in which genetics, diet, and lifestyle affect human longevity. It also allows us to determine the age of human remains with a fair degree of precision.

The record for the maximum verified lifespan in the modern world is years for women (Jeanne Calment) and 116 years for men (Jiroemon Kimura). Some scientists estimate that in case of the most ideal conditions people can live up to 127 years. This does not exclude the theoretical possibility that in the case of a fortunate combination of mutations there could be a person who lives longer. Though the lifespan of humans is one of the longest in nature, there are animals that live longer. For example, some individuals of the Galapagos tortoise live more than 175 years, and some individuals of the bowhead whale more than 200 years. Some scientists cautiously suggest that the human body can have sufficient resources to live up to 150 years.

==Extreme longevity claims in religion==

===Abrahamic religions===
==== Judaism ====
Several parts of the Hebrew Bible, including the Torah, Joshua, Job, and Chronicles, mention individuals with very long lifespans, up to the 969 years of Methuselah.

The Sefer haYashar narrates that all of the long-lived people belonged to a special class and that Methusaleh was the last member. Methusaleh also lived long enough to evangelize with his grandson Noah in the antediluvian world.

==== Christianity ====
Some Christian apologists explain the extreme ages in the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) as ancient mistranslations that converted the word &quot;month&quot; to &quot;year&quot;, mistaking lunar cycles for solar ones: this would turn an age of 969 years into a more reasonable 969 lunar months, or about 78.3 solar years. Donald Etz says that the Genesis 5 numbers were multiplied by ten by a later editor.

Both these interpretations introduce an inconsistency: they would mean that the ages of the first nine patriarchs at fatherhood, ranging from 62 to 230 years in the manuscripts, would then be transformed into an implausible range such as 5 to years. Others say that the first list, of only 10 names for 1,656 years, may contain generational gaps, which would have been represented by the lengthy lifetimes attributed to the patriarchs. Nineteenth-century critic Vincent Goehlert suggests the lifetimes &quot;represented epochs merely, to which were given the names of the personages especially prominent in such epochs, who, in consequence of their comparatively long lives, were able to acquire an exalted influence&quot;.

Those biblical scholars that teach literal interpretation give explanations for the advanced ages of the early patriarchs. In one view, man was originally to have everlasting life, but as sin was introduced into the world by Adam, its influence became greater with each generation and God progressively shortened man&#x27;s life. In a second view, before Noah&#x27;s flood, a &quot;firmament&quot; over the earth () contributed to people&#x27;s advanced ages.
The Bible&#x27;s own (brief) explanation for these ages approaches the question from a different angle, explaining instead the relative shortness of normal lives in (CSB): &quot;And the Lord said, &#x27;My Spirit will not remain with mankind forever, because they are corrupt. Their days will be 120 years.

Conservative apologist William Lane Craig believes that the longevity myths should be understood as &#x27;mytho-history&#x27;, where the ages of culturally significant figures were exaggerated to make a political or theological point. He points to similar practices found in neighboring cultures such as the Babylonians and argues that both Hebrews and Babylonians were aware that human longevity was biologically unfeasible. Similar arguments were made by professor Robert Gnuse.

Here are some more modern examples of Christian longevity claims:

* is said to have lived in Bivona, Italy, 1448–1578 (age ), according to the archive of Monastero di San Paolo in Bivona located in Palermo.
* Around 1912, the &quot;Maharishi of Kailash&quot; was said by missionary Sadhu Sundar Singh to be a Christian hermit of over 300 years of age in a Himalayan mountain cave, with whom he spent some time in deep fellowship. Singh said the Maharishi was born in Alexandria, Egypt, and baptized by the nephew of St. Francis Xavier.

==== Islam ====
Ibrahim (إِبْرَاهِيم) was said to have lived to years. His wife Sarah is the only woman in the Old Testament whose age is given. She died at 127 ().

==Modern extreme longevity claims==
This list includes claims of longevity of 130 and older from the 14th century onward. All birth year and age claims are alleged unless stated otherwise.
===Isolated===

===Documented===
The following cases have been documented in detail over time.

===Other===
* The Assamese polymath Sankardev (1449–1568) allegedly lived to the age of 118.
* Albrecht von Haller allegedly collected examples of 62 people ages 110–120, 29 ages 120–130, and 15 ages 130–140.
* A 1973 &quot;National Geographic&quot; article on longevity reported, as a very aged people, the Burusho–Hunza people in the Hunza Valley of the mountains of Pakistan.
* Swedish death registers contain detailed information on thousands of centenarians going back to 1749; the maximum age at death reported between 1751 and 1800 was 147.
* Cases of extreme longevity in the United Kingdom were listed by James Easton in 1799, who covered 1,712 cases documented between 66 BC and 1799, the year of publication; Charles Hulbert also edited a book containing a list of cases in 1825.
* A periodical &quot;The Aesculapian Register&quot;, written by physicians and published in Philadelphia in 1824, listed a number of cases, including several purported to have lived over 130. The authors said the list was taken from the &quot;Dublin Magazine&quot;.
* Deaths officially reported in the Russian Empire in 1815 listed 1,068 centenarians, including 246 supercentenarians (50 at age 120–155 and one even older). &quot;Time&quot; magazine considered that, by the Soviet Union, longevity had elevated to a state-supported &quot;Methuselah cult&quot;. The USSR insisted on its citizens&#x27; unrivaled longevity by claiming 592 people (224 male, 368 female) over age 120 in a 15 January 1959 census and 100 citizens of the Russian SSR alone aged 120 to 156 in March 1960. According to the opinion of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, in Georgia such claims were fostered by Georgian-born Joseph Stalin&#x27;s apparent hope that such longevity might rub off on him. Zhores A. Medvedev, who demonstrated that all 500-plus claims failed birth-record validation and other tests, said that Stalin &quot;liked the idea that [other] Georgians lived to be 100&quot;.
* An early 1812 &quot;Peterburgskaya Gazeta&quot; reports a man between ages 200 and 225 in the diocese of Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipro, Ukraine).

==Medieval era==

===Poland===
*Piast Kołodziej, King of Poland, died in 861 at the alleged age of 120 (740 AD/861 AD).

===Wales===
*Welsh bard Llywarch Hen (&quot;Heroic Elegies&quot;) died in the parish of Llanvor, traditionally about age 150.

===England===
*Edgar Ætheling, English prince who was briefly King of England after the death of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings in late 1066. Edgar is said to have died shortly after 1126, when William of Malmesbury wrote that he &quot;now grows old in the country in privacy and quiet&quot;. However, two pipe rolls exist from the years 1158 and 1167 which list Edgar. The historian Edward Augustus Freeman stated that this referred either to Edgar (aged at least 115), to a son of his, or to another person who bore the title &quot;Ætheling&quot;.

==Practices==
===Diets===
According to a 2021 review, there is no clinical evidence that any dietary practice contributes to longevity.

===Alchemy===
Traditions that have been believed to confer greater human longevity include alchemy.
*Nicolas Flamel (early 1330s – ) was a 14th-century scrivener who developed a reputation as alchemist and creator of an &quot;elixir of life&quot; that conferred immortality upon himself and his wife Perenelle. His arcanely inscribed tombstone is preserved at the Musée de Cluny in Paris.
*Fridericus (Ludovicus) Gualdus (), author of &quot;Revelation of the True Chemical Wisdom&quot;, lived in Venice in the 1680s. His age was reported in a letter in a contemporary Dutch newspaper to be over 400. By some accounts, when asked about a portrait he carried, he said it was of himself, painted by Titian (who died in 1576), but gave no explanation and left Venice the following morning. By another account, Gualdus left Venice due to religious accusations and died in 1724. The &quot;Compass der Weisen&quot; alludes to him as still alive in 1782 and nearly 600 years old.

<doc id="332952" wikidata="Q2125439" url="?curid=332952" title="Cannula">
<text>A cannula (; Latin meaning &#x27;little reed&#x27;; : cannulae or cannulas) is a tube that can be inserted into the body, often for the delivery or removal of fluid or for the gathering of samples. In simple terms, a cannula can surround the inner or outer surfaces of a trocar needle thus extending the effective needle length by at least half the length of the original needle. Its size mainly ranges from 14 to 26 gauge. Different-sized cannula have different colours as coded.

Decannulation is the permanent removal of a cannula (extubation), especially of a tracheostomy cannula, once a physician determines it is no longer needed for breathing.

== Medicine ==
Cannulas normally come with a trocar inside. The trocar is a needle, which punctures the body in order to get into the intended space.

Intravenous cannulas are the most common in hospital use. A variety of cannulas are used to establish cardiopulmonary bypass in cardiac surgery. A nasal cannula is a piece of plastic tubing that runs under the nose and is used to administer oxygen.

=== Intravenous cannulation ===

A venous cannula is inserted into a vein, primarily for the administration of intravenous fluids, for obtaining blood samples and for administering medicines. An arterial cannula is inserted into an artery, commonly the radial artery, and is used during major operations and in critical care areas to measure beat-to-beat blood pressure and to draw repeated blood samples. Insertion of the venous cannula can be a painful procedure that can lead to anxiety and stress. Use of a vapocoolant (cold spray) immediately before cannulation reduces pain during the procedure, without increasing the difficulty of cannulation.

Complications may arise in the vein as a result of the cannulation procedure, the four main groups of complication are:

* hematoma: a collection of blood, which can result from failure to puncture the vein when the cannula is inserted or when the cannula is removed. The selection of an appropriate vein and gently applying pressure slightly above the insertion point on removal of the cannula may prevent this.
* infiltration: when infusate enters the subcutaneous tissue instead of the vein. To prevent this, a cannula with accurate trim distances may be used. It is essential to fix the cannula in place firmly.
* embolism: this can be caused by air, a thrombus, or fragment of a catheter breaking off and entering the venous system. It can cause a pulmonary embolism. Air emboli can be avoided by making sure that there is no air in the system. A thromboembolism can be avoided by using a smaller cannula.
* phlebitis: an inflammation of the vein resulting from mechanical or chemical irritation or from an infection. Phlebitis can be avoided by carefully choosing the site for cannulation and by checking the type of infusate used.

===Aortic cannulation===
An aortic cannula may be placed in the aorta, for example in a diseased ascending aorta, using the Seldinger technique.

=== Nasal cannulation and oral-nasal cannulation ===
A nasal cannula or an oral–nasal cannula consists of a flexible tube, usually with multiple short, open-ended branches for comfortable insertion into the nostrils and/or mouth, and may be used for the delivery of a gas (such as pure oxygen), a gas mixture (as, for example, during anesthesia), or to measure airflow into and out of the nose and/or mouth.

=== Tracheotomy tube ===
The removal of a tracheotomy tube is referred to as decannulation.

==Veterinary use==
A cannula is used in an emergency procedure to relieve pressure and bloating in cattle and sheep with ruminal tympany, due most commonly to their accidentally grazing wilted legume or legume-dominant pastures, particularly alfalfa, ladino, and red and white clover.

Cannulas are a component used in the insertion of the Verichip.

Much larger cannulas are used to research about the digestive system of cannulated cows.

==Aesthetic medicine and anti-ageing==

In aesthetic medicine, a blunt-tip cannula or microcannula (also called smooth tip microcannula, blunt tipped cannula, or simply microcannula) is a small tube with an edge that is not sharp and an extrusion port or pore near the tip which is designed for atraumatic subdermal injections of fluids or gels.

Depending on the size of the internal diameter, it can be used either for the injection of cosmetic wrinkle fillers like hyaluronic acid, collagen, poly-L-lactic acid, CaHA, etc., or for fat transfer (Liposuction). The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic surgery notes additional soft tissue fillers like calcium hydroxy-apatite and polymethylmethacrylate. The advantage of using these is that they are less painful, have less risk of bruising, have less swelling, and a better safety profile. Accidental intravascular injections are more difficult with blunt-tip microcannulas, reducing the risk of skin necrosis, ulcers, and embolization to the retinal artery which can result in blindness. Indeed, in May 2015, the USA issued a warning of these risks as an FDA Safety Communication on the &quot;Unintentional Injection of Soft Tissue Filler Into Blood Vessels In the Face&quot;.

In January 2012, the &quot;Dermasculpt&quot; microcannula was approved by the FDA for use in the United States for use with soft tissue fillers followed by the &quot;Magic Needle&quot;, &quot;Softfil&quot;, &quot;TSK STERiGLIDE™ by Air-Tite Products&quot;, and &quot;Sculpt-face&quot;. The primary structural differences between microcannulas is the distance of the extrusion port or pore from the tip (closer is more precise), the bluntness of the tip (tapered blunt tip is easier for entry), and the flexibility of the shaft (enough flexibility to move around sensitive structures but enough rigidity for precise placement).

Since microcannula tips are blunt, a Pilot or Introducer needle is required for entry through the skin and the technique is to thread the microcannula through this tiny opening. Microcannula cosmetic injection techniques have been developed on how to best place cosmetic wrinkle fillers such as the Long MicroCannula Double Cross-Hatched Fan and the Wiggle Progression techniques.

In April 2016, the concept of the use of microcannula to inject more than cosmetic fillers was first published. The technique of Microcannula Injected Local Anesthesia (MILA) was described on the use of microcannula to inject local anesthesia with less pain, bruising, and swelling. Also introduced were Accelerated Healing After Platelet-Rich Plasma (AHA-PRP), Accelerated Healing After Platelet-Rich Fibrin Matrix (AHA-PRFM), and the use of microcannula to dissolve Sculptra nodules.

==Body piercing==
Cannulas are used in body piercing when using a standard IV needle (usually between 18GA and 12GA, although may be as large as 0GA, in which case the procedure is known as dermal punching and uses a biopsy punch without a cannula), and for inserting hooks for suspensions.

During piercing, the fistula is created by inserting the needle. The needle is then removed, leaving the cannula in place, which is sometimes trimmed down. The cannula is then removed and sterile jewelry is inserted into the fistula simultaneously, in order to minimise trauma to the fresh fistula caused by insertion of blunt-ended jewelry.

==Non-medical use==
In biological research, a push-pull cannula, which both withdraws and injects fluid, can be used to determine the effect of a certain chemical on a specific cell. The push part of the cannula is filled with a physiological solution plus the chemical of interest and is then injected slowly into the local cellular environment of a cell. The pull cannula then draws liquid from the extracellular medium, thus measuring the cellular response to the chemical of interest. This technique is especially used for neuroscience.

In general aviation, a cannula refers to a piece of plastic tubing that runs under the nose and is used to administer oxygen in non-pressurized aircraft flying 10,000 feet above sea level.

In synthetic chemistry, a cannula refers to a piece of stainless steel or plastic tubing used to transfer liquids or gases from one vessel to another without exposure to air. See more at Cannula transfer.

<text>Marie-Louise Fébronie Meilleur (; Chassé; August 29, 1880 – April 16, 1998) was a Canadian supercentenarian. She is the oldest validated Canadian ever and upon the death of longevity world record holder Jeanne Calment, became the world&#x27;s oldest recognized living person.

== Early life ==
Marie-Louise Fébronie Chassé was born on August 29, 1880, in Kamouraska, Quebec, to Pierre Charles Pitre Chassé and Marie-Catherine Fébronie Lévesque.

She married her first husband, Étienne Leclerc, at age 20 in 1900. Leclerc was a fisherman and died of pneumonia on February 24, 1911, aged 39. They had six children; four survived to adulthood.

In the following twelve months, both of her parents died: her father on June 25, 1911, aged 61; and her mother on February 23, 1912, aged 59.

=== Move to Ontario ===
In 1913, Marie-Louise placed two of her four surviving children with family or friends, and moved to the Ontario border to help support her sister, whose children were sick with diphtheria. There she married her second husband, Hector Meilleur, on October 25, 1915. They had six children together.

== Return to Kamouraska and later life ==
Meilleur did not return to the Quebec region until 1939, when she settled again in Kamouraska. Her second husband Hector Meilleur died in 1972 at age 93, of diabetes.

From that time Meilleur lived with one of her daughters for a period. When she needed more care, she moved to a nursing home in Corbeil. Of the twelve children born to her, only four survived her. She had 85 grandchildren, 80 great-grandchildren, 57 great-great-grandchildren, and four great-great-great-grandchildren.

Meilleur quit smoking at age 102 in 1982, after catching a cold. In 1986, when asked the secret to long life, she claimed it was hard work. Meilleur was a vegetarian. She became the world&#x27;s oldest living person on August 4, 1997, after the death of 122-year-old Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment. By her 117th birthday, she was too weak to talk, and could hear only if someone shouted directly into her right ear.

== Death ==
Marie-Louise Meilleur died of a thrombus at age 117 on April 16, 1998, in Corbeil. One of her sons was living in the same nursing home, and her oldest living daughter, Gabrielle Vaughan, was ninety. Vaughan died in 2004 at age 96. Meilleur was buried alongside her second husband in Swisha, where she had previously lived.

American Sarah Knauss (1880–1999) succeeded her as the oldest living person.

<doc id="332961" wikidata="Q383434" url="?curid=332961" title="Greater Sudbury">
<text>Sudbury, officially the City of Greater Sudbury, is the largest city in Northern Ontario by population, with a population of 166,004 at the 2021 Canadian Census. By land area, it is the largest in Ontario and the fifth largest in Canada. It is administratively a single-tier municipality and thus is not part of any district, county, or regional municipality. The City of Greater Sudbury is separate from, but entirely surrounded by the Sudbury District. The city is also referred to as &quot;Ville du &quot; among Francophones.

The Sudbury region was inhabited by the Ojibwe people of the Algonquin group for thousands of years prior to the founding of Sudbury after the discovery of nickel and copper ore in 1883 during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Greater Sudbury was formed in 2001 by merging the cities and towns of the former Regional Municipality of Sudbury with several previously unincorporated townships. Being located inland, the local climate is extremely seasonal, with average January lows of around and average July highs of .

The population resides in an urban core and many smaller communities scattered around 330 lakes and among hills of rock blackened by historical smelting activity. Sudbury was once a major lumber center and a world leader in nickel mining. Mining and related industries dominated the economy for much of the 20th century. The two major mining companies which shaped the history of Sudbury were Inco, now Vale Limited, which employed more than 25% of the population by the 1970s, and Falconbridge, now Glencore. Sudbury has since expanded from its resource-based economy to emerge as the major retail, economic, health, and educational center for Northeastern Ontario. Sudbury is also home to a large Franco-Ontarian population, which influences its arts and culture.

==Toponymy==
James Worthington, the superintendent of construction on the Northern Ontario segment of the railway, selected the name Sudbury after Sudbury, Suffolk, in England, which was the hometown of his wife Caroline Hitchcock.

The city&#x27;s official name was changed to Greater Sudbury in 2001, when it was amalgamated with its suburban towns into the current city, on the grounds of ensuring that the merger did not erase the longstanding community identities of the outlying towns. In everyday usage, however, the city is still more commonly referred to as just Sudbury.

==History==

The Sudbury region was inhabited by the Ojibwe people of the Algonquin group as early as 9,000 years ago following the retreat of the last continental ice sheet. In 1850, local Ojibwe chiefs entered into an agreement with the British Crown to share a large tract of land, including what is now Sudbury, as part of the Robinson Huron Treaty. In exchange the Crown pledged to pay an annuity to First Nations people, which was originally set at $1.60 per treaty member and increased incrementally; its last increase was in 1874, leaving it fixed at $4.

French Jesuits were the first to establish a European settlement when they set up a mission called Sainte-Anne-des-Pins, just before the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1883. The Sainte-Anne-des-Pins church played a prominent role in the development of Franco-Ontarian culture in the region. Coincidentally, Ste-Anne is the patron saint of miners.
During construction of the railway in 1883, blasting and excavation revealed high concentrations of nickel-copper ore at Murray Mine on the edge of the Sudbury Basin. This discovery brought the first waves of European settlers, who arrived not only to work at the mines, but also to build a service station for railway workers. Provincial land surveyor JL Morris laid out the intersection of Elm Street and Durham Street in 1884 as he planned the township.

Rich deposits of nickel sulphide ore were discovered in the Sudbury Basin geological formation. The construction of the railway allowed exploitation of these mineral resources and shipment of the commodities to markets and ports, as well as large-scale lumber extraction. In 1886 the Canadian Copper Company and others besides had been formed with the idea to exploit the region&#x27;s natural wealth, and by 1888 the Copper Cliff smelter was born.

Sudbury was incorporated as a town in 1893, and its first mayor was Joseph Étienne aka Stephen Fournier.

The American inventor Thomas Edison visited the Sudbury area as a prospector in 1901. He is credited with the original discovery of the ore body at Falconbridge.

Mining began to replace lumber as the primary industry as the area&#x27;s transportation network was improved to include trams. These enabled workers to live in one community and work in another. Sudbury&#x27;s economy was dominated by the mining industry for much of the 20th century. Two major mining companies were created: Inco in 1902 and Falconbridge in 1928. They became two of the city&#x27;s major employers and two of the world&#x27;s leading producers of nickel.

Through the decades that followed, Sudbury&#x27;s economy went through boom and bust cycles as world demand for nickel fluctuated. Demand was high during the First World War, when Sudbury-mined nickel was used extensively in the manufacturing of artillery in Sheffield, England. It bottomed out when the war ended and then rose again in the mid-1920s as peacetime uses for nickel began to develop. The town was reincorporated as a city in 1930.

The city recovered from the Great Depression much more quickly than almost any other city in North America due to increased demand for nickel in the 1930s. Sudbury was the fastest-growing city and one of the wealthiest cities in Canada for most of the decade. Many of the city&#x27;s social problems in the Great Depression era were not caused by unemployment or poverty, but due to the difficulty in keeping up with all of the new infrastructure demands created by rapid growth — for example, employed mineworkers sometimes ended up living in boarding houses or makeshift shanty towns, because demand for new housing was rising faster than supply. Between 1936 and 1941, the city was ordered into receivership by the Ontario Municipal Board. Another economic slowdown affected the city in 1937, but the city&#x27;s fortunes rose again with wartime demands during the Second World War. The Frood Mine alone accounted for 40 percent of all the nickel used in Allied artillery production during the war. After the end of the war, Sudbury was in a good position to supply nickel to the United States government when it decided to stockpile non-Soviet supplies during the Cold War.

The open coke beds used in the early to mid-20th century and logging for fuel resulted in a near-total loss of native vegetation in the area. Consequently, the terrain was made up of exposed rocky outcrops permanently stained charcoal black by the air pollution from the roasting yards. Acid rain added more staining, in a layer that penetrates up to into the once pink-grey granite.

The construction of the Inco Superstack in 1972 dispersed sulphuric acid through the air over a much wider area, reducing the acidity of local precipitation. This enabled the municipality, province and Inco and academics from Laurentian University to begin an environmental recovery program in the late 1970s, labelled a &quot;regreening&quot; effort. Lime was spread over the charred soil by hand and by aircraft. Seeds of wild grasses and other vegetation were also spread. As of 2010, 9.2 million new trees have been planted in the city. Vale has begun to rehabilitate the slag heaps that surrounds their smelter in the Copper Cliff area with the planting of grass and trees, as well as the use of biosolids to stabilize and regreen tailings areas.
In 1978, the workers of Sudbury&#x27;s largest mining corporation, Inco (now Vale), embarked on a strike over production and employment cutbacks. The strike, which lasted for nine months, badly damaged Sudbury&#x27;s economy. The city government was spurred to launch a project to diversify the city&#x27;s economy.

A unique and visionary project, Science North was inaugurated in 1984 with two-snowflake styled buildings connected by a tunnel through the Canadian shield where the Creighton fault intersects the shores of Lake Ramsey. The city tried to attract new employers and industries through the 1980s and 1990s with mixed success. The city of Sudbury and its suburban communities, which were reorganized into the Regional Municipality of Sudbury in 1973, was subsequently merged in 2001 into the single-tier city of Greater Sudbury.

In 2006, both of the city&#x27;s major mining companies, Canadian-based Inco and Falconbridge, were taken over by new owners: Inco was acquired by the Brazilian company CVRD (now renamed Vale), while Falconbridge was purchased by the Swiss company Xstrata, which itself was purchased by Anglo–Swiss Glencore, forming Glencore Xstrata. Xstrata donated the historic Edison Building, the onetime head office of Falconbridge, to the city in 2007 to serve as the new home of the municipal archives. On September 19, 2008, a fire destroyed the historic Sudbury Steelworkers Hall on Frood Road. A strike at Vale&#x27;s operations, which began on July 13, 2009, was tentatively resolved in July 2010. The 2009 strike lasted longer than the devastating 1978 strike, but had a much more modest effect on the city&#x27;s economy than the earlier action—unlike in 1978, the local rate of unemployment &quot;declined&quot; slightly during the 2009 strike.

The ecology of the Sudbury region has recovered dramatically, helped by regreening programs and improved mining practices. The United Nations honoured twelve cities in the world, including Sudbury, with the Local Government Honours Award at the 1992 Earth Summit to recognise the city&#x27;s community-based environmental reclamation strategies. By 2010, the regreening programs had successfully rehabilitated of land in the city; however, approximately of land have yet to be rehabilitated.

Various studies have confirmed that the provincial government&#x27;s initial claims that the municipal amalgamation would result in cost savings and increased efficiencies have not borne out, and in fact administration of the amalgamated city costs significantly more than the prior regional government structure did.

==Geography==

Sudbury has 330 lakes over in size within the city limits. The most prominent is Lake Wanapitei, the largest lake in the world completely contained within the boundaries of a single city. Ramsey Lake, a few kilometres south of downtown Sudbury, held the same record before the municipal amalgamation in 2001 brought Lake Wanapitei fully inside the city limits. Sudbury is divided into two main watersheds: to the east is the French River watershed which flows into Georgian Bay and to the west is the Spanish River watershed which flows into the North Channel of Lake Huron.

Sudbury is built around many small, rocky mountains with exposed igneous rock of the Canadian (Precambrian) Shield. The ore deposits in Sudbury are part of a large geological structure known as the Sudbury Basin, which are the remnants of a nearly two billion-year-old impact crater; long thought to be the result of a meteorite collision, more recent analysis has suggested that the crater may in fact have been created by a comet.

Sudbury&#x27;s pentlandite, pyrite and pyrrhotite ores contain profitable amounts of many elements—primarily nickel and copper, but also platinum, palladium and other valuable metals.

Local smelting of the ore releases this sulphur into the atmosphere where it combines with water vapour to form sulphuric acid, contributing to acid rain. As a result, Sudbury has had a widespread reputation as a wasteland. In parts of the city, vegetation was devastated by acid rain and logging to provide fuel for early smelting techniques. To a lesser extent, the area&#x27;s ecology was also impacted by lumber camps in the area providing wood for the reconstruction of Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. While other logging areas in Northeastern Ontario were also involved in that effort, the emergence of mining-related processes in the following decade made it significantly harder for new trees to grow to full maturity in the Sudbury area than elsewhere.

The resulting erosion exposed bedrock in many parts of the city, which was charred in most places to a pitted, dark black appearance. There was not a complete lack of vegetation in the region as paper birch and wild blueberry patches thrived in the acidic soils. During the Apollo crewed lunar exploration program, NASA astronauts trained in Sudbury to become familiar with impact breccia and shatter cones, rare rock formations produced by large meteorite impacts. However, the popular misconception that they were visiting Sudbury because it purportedly resembled the lifeless surface of the Moon persists.

The city&#x27;s Nickel District Conservation Authority operates a conservation area, the Lake Laurentian Conservation Area, in the city&#x27;s south end. Other unique environmental projects in the city include the Fielding Bird Sanctuary, a protected area along Highway 17 near Lively that provides a managed natural habitat for birds, and a hiking and nature trail near Coniston, which is named in honour of scientist Jane Goodall.

Six provincial parks (Chiniguchi River, Daisy Lake Uplands, Fairbank, Killarney Lakelands and Headwaters, Wanapitei and Windy Lake) and two provincial conservation reserves (MacLennan Esker Forest and Tilton Forest) are also located partially or entirely within the city boundaries.

===Climate===

Greater Sudbury has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot;). This region has warm and often humid summers with occasional short lasting periods of hot weather, with long, cold and snowy winters. It is situated north of the Great Lakes, making it prone to arctic air masses. Monthly precipitation is equal year round, with snow cover expected for up to six months of the year. Although extreme weather events are rare, one of the worst tornadoes in Canadian history struck the city and its suburbs on August 20, 1970, killing six people, injuring two hundred, and causing more than C$17 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in damages.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Greater Sudbury was on July 13, 1936. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on December 29, 1933.

===Communities===

The city of Sudbury and its suburban communities were reorganized into the Regional Municipality of Sudbury in 1973, which was subsequently merged in 2001 into the single-tier city of Greater Sudbury.

In common usage, the city&#x27;s urban core is still generally referred to as &quot;Sudbury&quot;, while the outlying former towns are still referred to by their old names and continue in some respects to maintain their own distinct community identities despite their lack of political independence. Each of the seven former municipalities in turn encompasses numerous smaller neighbourhoods. Amalgamated cities (2001 Canadian census population) include: Sudbury (85,354) and Valley East (22,374). Towns (2001 Canadian census population) include: Rayside-Balfour (15,046), Nickel Centre (12,672), Walden (10,101), Onaping Falls (4,887), and Capreol (3,486). The Wanup area, formerly an unincorporated settlement outside of Sudbury&#x27;s old city limits, was also annexed into the city in 2001, along with a large wilderness area on the northeastern shore of Lake Wanapitei.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Greater Sudbury had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

At the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Greater Sudbury CMA had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 2011, the population of Sudbury was less educated than the Canadian average, with 17.2% of the population holding a university degree (compared to 23.3% nationally) and 18.1% with no certificate, diploma or degree (compared to 17.3% nationally).

In 2021, the median age was 43.2 years, slightly higher than the provincial average of 41.6 years.

=== Ethnicity ===
Greater Sudbury has few visible minorities with reporting visible minority status on the 2021 census compared to the national average of , but a much higher percentage of Indigenous Canadians () than the national average of . Visible minorities representing over 0.5% of the population include: 2.5% Black, 1.9% South Asian, and 0.6% Chinese.

*Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses.

=== Religion ===

According to the 2021 census profile, the residents of Greater Sudbury are predominantly Christian. Around 64% (down from 81% in 2011) of the population belongs to Christian denominations with Catholics composing the largest single group (47%, down from 59% in 2011). Those with no religious affiliation accounted for 33% (up from 18% in 2011) of the population. Other religions such as Islam, Judaism, and Hinduism constitute around 3% of the population in total, up from 1% in 2011.

=== Language ===
Sudbury is a bilingual city with a large francophone population, with 37.5% of Sudburians able to speak French and 22.6% having French as mother tongue. 83.8% of the population use English as the language spoken most often at home, followed by French at 10.6%, which is significantly higher than the Ontario average of 1.8%.

==Economy==

After a brief period as a lumber camp, Sudbury&#x27;s economy was dominated by the mining industry for much of the 20th century. By the 1970s, Inco employed a quarter of the local workforce. However, in 2006, Inco and Falconbridge were taken over by foreign multinational corporations: Inco was acquired by the Brazilian company Vale, and Falconbridge was purchased by the Swiss company Xstrata which was in turn purchased by Anglo–Swiss Glencore forming Glencore Xstrata. Several other mining companies, including First Nickel and KGHM, also have mining operations in the Sudbury area.

Mining now employs only 6,000 people in the city, although the mining supply and service sector employs a further 10,000. By 2006, 80% of Greater Sudbury&#x27;s labour force was employed in services with 20% remaining in manufacturing. Over 345 mining supply and service companies are located in Sudbury. This includes a number of public and private firms pursuing research and development in new mining technologies such as Mining Innovation Rehabilitation and Applied Research Corporation (MIRARCO), the Northern Center for Advanced Technology (NORCAT), and the Centre for Excellence in Mining Innovation (CEMI).

While mining has decreased in relative importance, Sudbury&#x27;s economy has diversified to establish itself as a major centre of finance, business, tourism, health care, education, government, and science and technology research. Many of these reflect Sudbury&#x27;s position as a regional service center for Northeastern Ontario, a market of 550,000 people.

The top employers in Sudbury as of November 2010 include:
Many retail businesses in the city have moved outside of the downtown core in the late 20th century and the city has struggled to rebuild and maintain a vibrant downtown core. In the 2000s and early 2010s, projects aimed at revitalizing the downtown core included the creation of Market Square, a farmer&#x27;s and craft market; the redevelopment of the Rainbow Center Mall; streetscape beautification projects; the conversion of several underutilized historic properties into mixed-use office and loft developments; and the establishment and launch of the McEwen School of Architecture, as well as cultural events such as Downtown Rotary Blues for Food, Sudbury&#x27;s Largest Yard and Sidewalk Sale, Downtown Sudbury Ribfest and the Up Here art and music festival. New projects underway in the late 2010s include Place des Arts, a performing and visual arts center; and the redesign and renovation of the central plaza at Tom Davies Square.

Despite these efforts a large percentage of the city&#x27;s retail service sector is still found outside of the downtown core, in areas such as the Four Corners, the RioCan and Silver Hills power centres on the Kingsway, and the New Sudbury Centre, the largest shopping mall in Northern Ontario with 110 stores.

===Film industry===
Sudbury has an emerging film and television industry, with a number of projects filming in the city in the 2000s. Development of an active film and television production industry in Northern Ontario was initially undertaken by Cinéfest, the city&#x27;s largest annual film festival, in the early 1990s, and is currently overseen by Music and Film in Motion, a non-profit organization based in Sudbury.

Films shot in the city have included &quot; Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City&quot;, &quot;Roadkill&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Truth&quot;, &quot;The Lesser Blessed&quot;, &quot;High Chicago&quot;, &quot;Perspective&quot;, &quot;The Captive&quot;, &quot;Ice Soldiers&quot;, &quot;Born to Be Blue&quot;, &quot;Your Name Here&quot;, &quot;Indian Horse&quot;, &quot;The New Romantic&quot; and &quot;Men with Brooms&quot;. Television series filmed in the city include &quot;Météo+&quot;, &quot;Les Bleus de Ramville&quot;, &quot;Hard Rock Medical&quot;, &quot;Dark Rising: Warrior of Worlds&quot;, &quot;Letterkenny&quot;, &quot;St. Nickel&quot;, &quot;Cardinal&quot;, &quot;What Would Sal Do?&quot;, &quot;Bad Blood&quot; and &quot;Shoresy&quot;.

March Entertainment&#x27;s studio in Sudbury has produced a number of animated television series, including &quot;Chilly Beach&quot;, &quot;Maple Shorts&quot;, &quot;Yam Roll&quot;, and &quot;Dex Hamilton: Alien Entomologist&quot;.

The city&#x27;s LGBT community has been profiled in two documentary films, the Genie Award-winning &quot;Mum&#x27;s the Word (Maman et Ève)&quot; in 1996 and &quot;The Pinco Triangle&quot; in 1999.

Sudbury is also home to the Science North Production Team, an award-winning producer of documentary films and multimedia presentations for museums. Independent filmmaker B. P. Paquette is based in Sudbury. Inner City Films, a production company owned by Sudbury native Robert Adetuyi, also has a production office in the city, as does Carte Blanche Films, the producer of &quot;Météo+&quot;, &quot;Les Blues de Ramville&quot; and &quot;Hard Rock Medical&quot;.

=== Architecture ===
With the construction of the Laurentian University McEwen School of Architecture, as well as increasing development in the city, architecture has become an increasingly important part of the economy in Sudbury.

Notable architecture in Greater Sudbury:

* Ledo Hotel, a historic building in downtown Sudbury, which has seen many uses since its construction in 1910. 
* St. Andrew&#x27;s Place, a church-community-complex which opened in 1972.
* Sudbury&#x27;s Shaar Hashomayim Synagogue, is a community-led synagogue which was constructed in 1960 and is the only synagogue in Sudbury.
*Moses Block, Durham at Elgin, Sudbury&#x27;s only flatiron building built in 1907

==Government==
===Municipal politics===
From the city hall at Tom Davies Square, the city is headed by twelve council members and one mayor both elected every four years. The current mayor is Paul Lefebvre, who was elected in the 2022 municipal election. The 2011 operating budget for Greater Sudbury was C$471 million, and the city employs 2006 full-time workers.

===Federal and provincial politics===
The city is divided between the federal electoral districts of Sudbury and Nickel Belt in the House of Commons of Canada, and the provincial electoral districts of Sudbury and Nickel Belt in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. The federal and provincial districts do not have identical boundaries despite using the same names; most notably, the Walden district of the city is located in Sudbury federally but in Nickel Belt provincially. The city is represented federally by Members of Parliament Viviane Lapointe and Marc Serré, both of the Liberal Party of Canada, and provincially by Jamie West and France Gélinas of the Ontario New Democratic Party. The provincial Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines has its head office in the city.

Both federal and provincial politics in the city tend to be dominated by the Liberal and New Democratic parties. Historically, the Liberals have been stronger in the Sudbury riding, with the New Democrats dominant in Nickel Belt, although both ridings have elected members of both parties at different times.

==Culture==
With over 22% of its population having French as its mother tongue, Greater Sudbury&#x27;s culture is influenced by the large Franco-Ontarian community, particularly in the amalgamated municipalities of Valley East and Rayside-Balfour and historically in the Moulin-à-Fleur neighbourhood. The French culture is celebrated with the Franco-Ontarian flag, recognized by the province as an official emblem, which was created in 1975 by a group of teachers at Laurentian University and after some controversy has flown at Tom Davies Square since 2006. The large francophone community plays a central role in developing and maintaining many of the cultural institutions of Sudbury including the Théâtre du Nouvel-Ontario, La Nuit sur l&#x27;étang, La Galerie du Nouvel-Ontario, Le Centre franco-ontarien de folklore and the Prise de parole publishing company. The city hosted &quot;Les Jeux de la francophonie canadienne&quot; in 2011.

===Arts===

The Sudbury Arts Council was established in 1974. Its mandate is to connect, communicate and celebrate the arts. It has an important role to provide a calendar of events and news about arts and culture activities. The city is home to two art galleries—the Art Gallery of Sudbury and La Galerie du Nouvel-Ontario. Both are dedicated primarily to Canadian art, especially artists from Northern Ontario.

The city&#x27;s only professional theatre company is the francophone Théâtre du Nouvel-Ontario (TNO), one of seven organizations residing at the Place des Arts, where it also stages its performances. The Sudbury Theatre Centre, which was the city&#x27;s only professional English-language theatre company, merged with YES Theatre in 2023, though the building which was previously home to the company retains its original name. Theatrical productions are also staged by several community theatre groups, as well as by high school drama students at Sudbury Secondary School, Lo-Ellen Park Secondary School, St. Charles College and École secondaire Macdonald-Cartier with its troupe Les Draveurs. Postsecondary institutions in the city no longer offer training in theatre, following the closures of Theatre programs at Thorneloe University in 2020 and Laurentian University in 2021, as well as the technical production programs at Collège Boréal and Cambrian College.

In 2021, YES Theatre unveiled plans for the Refettorio, which would convert a vacant lot on Durham Street near the YMCA into an outdoor theatrical and musical performance space. The space opened in August 2023 with a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

Place des Arts, a new project to provide a community hub for the city&#x27;s francophone cultural institutions including a 300-seat concert hall, a 120-seat theatre studio, an art gallery, a bistro, a gift boutique and bookstore, a children&#x27;s arts center and 10,000 square feet of studio space for artists, began construction in the downtown core in 2019, and opened in 2022.

====Festivals====
Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival, the city&#x27;s primary annual film festival, has been staged in September each year since 1989. Two smaller specialist film festivals, the Junction North International Documentary Film Festival for documentary films and the Queer North Film Festival for LGBT-themed films, are also held each year. Mainstream commercial films are screened at the SilverCity theatre complex, which is also the primary venue for most Cinéfest screenings. Science North is home to an IMAX theatre which screens a program of IMAX films, the Cavern at Science North hosts some gala screenings during Cinéfest and screens science documentaries during the year, and the Sudbury Indie Cinema Co-op programs a repertory cinema lineup of independent and international films as well as organizing both the Junction North and Queer North film festivals.

In 2021 the Sudbury Indie Cinema Co-op also launched the Sudbury Outdoor Adventure Reels Film Festival, devoted to wilderness and adventure films, following several years of the city hosting an annual stop on the Banff Mountain Film Festival&#x27;s touring circuit, and in 2022 they launched both the Sudbury&#x27;s Tiny Underground Film Festival (STUFF) for underground and experimental films, and the Sudbury Indie Creature Kon for horror films.

The city has hosted an annual Sudbury Pride festival since 1997.

The Up Here Festival, launched in 2015, blends a program of musical performance with the creation of both murals and installation art projects throughout the downtown core, while PlaySmelter, a theatre festival devoted to theatrical and storytelling performances by local writers and actors, was launched in 2013, and is held at various venues in the city including the Sudbury Theatre Centre and Place des Arts.

In music, the city is home to the Northern Lights Festival Boréal and La Nuit sur l&#x27;étang festivals.

Sudbury also hosts Northern Ontario&#x27;s only Japanese cultural Festival, Japan Festival Sudbury. It started in 2019, went on hiatus for two years during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, and returned to Sudbury&#x27;s Bell Park Amphitheatre on July 16, 2022.

====Literature====
Works of fiction themed or set primarily or partially in Sudbury or its former suburbs include Robert J. Sawyer&#x27;s &quot;The Neanderthal Parallax&quot; trilogy, Alistair MacLeod&#x27;s novel &quot;No Great Mischief&quot;, Paul Quarrington&#x27;s &quot;Logan in Overtime&quot;, Jean-Marc Dalpé&#x27;s play &quot;1932, la ville du nickel&quot; and his short story collection &quot;Contes sudburois&quot;, and Chloé LaDuchesse&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Incendiare de Sudbury&quot;. The city is also fictionalized as &quot;Chinookville&quot; in several books by American comedy writer Jack Douglas, and as &quot;Complexity&quot; in Tomson Highway&#x27;s musical play &quot;The (Post) Mistress&quot;.

High-profile concerts take place at the Sudbury Community Arena, while other touring acts play venues including the Grand Theatre, Knox Hall, and The Towne House. 

Bell Park&#x27;s outdoor Grace Hartman Amphitheatre serves as the primary venue for the Northern Lights Festival Boréal, and hosts other summer concerts. Concerts are also sometimes staged at Laurentian University&#x27;s Fraser Auditorium, although it is also used for theatre shows, stand-up comedy performances and lectures rather than serving as a full-time music venue.

In addition to the Northern Lights Festival Boréal, the city is also home to the Up Here Festival, which blends musical performances by underground and experimental musicians with public mural projects, and La Nuit sur l&#x27;étang, a festival of francophone music. 

The local Sudbury Symphony Orchestra performs regular concerts of classical music, usually staged in the Sheridan Auditorium at Sudbury Secondary School but occasionally at other venues.

Sudbury is also home to the Blue Saints Drum and Bugle Corps, a youth drum corps active since 1952.

One of Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors&#x27; most famous songs, &quot;Sudbury Saturday Night&quot;, depicts the hard-drinking, hard-partying social life of hard rock miners of Sudbury.

===Attractions===

Science North is an interactive science museum and Northern Ontario&#x27;s most popular tourist attraction with around 288,000 visitors per year (as of 2018). It consists of two snowflake-shaped buildings on the southwestern shore of Ramsey Lake and just south of the city&#x27;s downtown core. There is also a former ice hockey arena on-site, which includes the complex&#x27;s entrance and an IMAX theatre. The snowflake buildings are connected by a rock tunnel, which passes through a billion-year-old geologic fault. Sudbury&#x27;s mining heritage is reflected in another major tourist attraction, Dynamic Earth. This interactive science museum focuses principally on geology and mining history exhibitions and is also home to the Big Nickel, one of Sudbury&#x27;s most famous landmarks. The city is also home to the Greater Sudbury Heritage Museums, a group of historical community museums, and a mining heritage monument overlooking the city&#x27;s Bell Park.

==Infrastructure==
===Health care===
Greater Sudbury serves as the health care center for much of northeastern Ontario through Health Sciences North. Sudbury is also the site of the Regional Cancer Program, which treats cancer patients from across the north. Sudbury&#x27;s first General Hospital opened in 1950 and operated until 2010. Now, known as St. Joseph Health Center, the building remains abandoned and the new Sudbury Regional Hospital functions with Health Sciences North on Ramsey Lake Road. In 1968, the first successful coronary artery bypass surgery in Canada was performed at Sudbury Memorial Hospital. Adult mental health services are also provided to the area through Health Sciences North, primarily at the Kirkwood site (formerly the Sudbury Algoma Hospital) and at the Cedar site downtown.

There is also a detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police located in the McFarlane Lake area of the city&#x27;s south end. Greater Sudbury Emergency Medical Services provides prehospital paramedic services with over 150 full-time and part-time paramedics. Greater Sudbury Fire Services operates from 24 fire stations located throughout the city, with a combination 103 career staff and 350 volunteer fire fighters. Prior to the municipal amalgamation of 2001, most of the suburban towns were served by separate volunteer fire departments, which were amalgamated into the citywide service as part of the municipal restructuring. The municipally owned energy provider Greater Sudbury Utilities serves the city&#x27;s urban core, while rural areas in the city continue to be served by Hydro One.

=== Utilities ===
Greater Sudbury Utilities Inc. (GSU) delivers utility services in the city&#x27;s urban core. Its sole shareholder is the City of Greater Sudbury.

===Transportation===

====Public transportation====

The city maintains a bus-based public transit system, GOVA, transporting 4.4 million passengers in 2012. The year 2000 marked the most significant change in Greater Sudbury&#x27;s local transit history, as outlying townships were annexed into the municipality to form Greater Sudbury, expanding Greater Sudbury Transit&#x27;s service area to one larger than most Ontario municipal and regional public transit agencies. The Downtown Transit Center is the primary hub for local transit in Sudbury.

====Air====

The Greater Sudbury Airport maintains two paved runways and in length and serves 270,784 passengers per year (2017). The airport is served by three regional carrier lines: Air Canada Express to Toronto Pearson International Airport, Porter Airlines to Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport and Bearskin Airlines to several destinations in Northern Ontario including North Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Timmins and Thunder Bay.

====Intercity transportation====

Several different agencies provide intercity transportation to Sudbury. Via Rail&#x27;s Sudbury–White River train (a remnant of the old &quot;Lake Superior&quot; passenger service to Thunder Bay) serves a number of remote interior communities, some of which are not accessible by road, from the downtown Sudbury station. To the north and east of the city, Capreol station and Sudbury Junction station are stops on Via Rail&#x27;s transcontinental passenger service, the &quot;Canadian&quot;, which passes through the area twice a week in each direction.

Intercity motor coach service is available at the Sudbury Ontario Northland Bus Terminal, which is a stop for Ontario Northland motor coaches. Destinations include North Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Hearst, Barrie, Toronto, and Ottawa.
====Roads and highways====

There are three highways connecting Sudbury to the rest of Ontario: Highway 17 is the main branch of the Trans-Canada Highway, connecting the city to points east and west. An approximately segment of Highway 17, from Mikkola to Whitefish, is freeway. The highway bypasses the city via two separately-constructed roads, the Southwest and Southeast Bypasses, that form a partial ring road around the southern end of the city&#x27;s urban core for traffic travelling through Highway 17. The former alignment of Highway 17 through the city is now Municipal Road 55. Highway 69, also a branch of the Trans-Canada Highway, leads south to Parry Sound, where it connects to the Highway 400 freeway to Toronto; Highway 400 is being extended to Greater Sudbury and is scheduled for completion in the 2020s. Highway 144 leads north to Highway 101 in Timmins.

Greater Sudbury is the only census division in Northern Ontario that maintains a system of numbered municipal roads, similar to the county road system in the southern part of the province. Secondary Highway 537, which essentially provides an outer bypass link between Highway 69 at Wanup and Highway 17 at Wahnapitae, is also the only remaining secondary highway in the province located in any census division which also has its own municipal or county road system.

==Education==
Greater Sudbury is home to three postsecondary institutions: Laurentian University, a primarily undergraduate bilingual university with approximately 9,000 students, Cambrian College, an English college of applied arts and technology with 4,500 full-time and 7,500 part-time students, Collège Boréal, a francophone college with 2,000 enrolled, and the Northern Ontario School of Medicine. On September 4, 2013, Laurentian University opened the McEwen School of Architecture in downtown Sudbury, the first new architecture school to launch in Canada in more than 40 years. Opened in 2011 and located on the Laurentian University campus is the Vale Living with Lakes Centre which focuses on the research of stressors that can affect the health of water based ecosystems, contributing to the better ecological health of Sudbury. Canadian post-secondary institutions have also impacted the city&#x27;s science and technology sectors. The Creighton Mine site in Sudbury is home to SNOLAB, the second-deepest (after China Jinping Underground Laboratory in China) underground laboratory in the world and the site of numerous dark matter experiments. Originally constructed for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (now concluded), the underground laboratory has been expanded and continues to operate as SNOLAB. The SNO equipment has been refurbished for use in the SNO+ experiment.

English-language public schooling is provided by the Rainbow District School Board. The board operates 28 elementary and nine secondary schools in Sudbury, one school for students with special needs, and the Cecil Facer Youth Center for young offenders. The Sudbury Catholic District School Board offers publicly funded English-language Catholic education, with 16 elementary schools, five high schools and an adult education center.

The Sudbury Tool Library and Makerspace are located at the main branch of the Greater Sudbury Public Library.

==Media==

As the largest city in Northern Ontario, Greater Sudbury is the region&#x27;s primary media center. Due to the relatively small size of the region&#x27;s individual media markets, most of the region is served at least partially by Sudbury-based media. CICI-TV produces almost all local programming on the CTV Northern Ontario system, and the CBC Radio stations CBCS-FM and CBON-FM broadcast to the entire region through extensive rebroadcaster networks. As well, many of the commercial radio stations in Northeastern Ontario&#x27;s smaller cities simulcast programming produced in Sudbury for at least a portion of their programming schedules, particularly in weekend and evening slots.

Sudbury&#x27;s daily newspaper, the &quot;Sudbury Star&quot; is owned by Postmedia, is published six days a week and has a weekday circulation of 17,530 as of 2006. The city&#x27;s longtime community newspaper &quot;Northern Life&quot; ceased print publication in 2020, concurrently with its sale from Laurentian Media Group to Village Media, and remains in operation as the web-only publication &quot;Sudbury.com&quot;.

There is also a weekly francophone publication, &quot;Le Voyageur&quot;. &quot;The South Side Story&quot; used to be a print and online publication but has been defunct since 2019.

==Notable people==

Notable people from Sudbury include television game-show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; host Alex Trebek (which he hosted from 1984 to his death in 2020), Supreme Court Justice Michelle O&#x27;Bonsawin, architect Jason F.

<doc id="332963" wikidata="Q2603674" url="?curid=332963" title="Maude Farris-Luse">
<text>Maude Farris-Luse (February 21, 1887 – March 18, 2002), later known as Maud Luse, was an American supercentenarian. According to the Guinness World Records, she was the oldest person in the world from June 2001 until her death nine months later, she was Initially thought to have been born in January until subsequent research from Longeviquest. at age . She outlived two husbands and six of her seven children. And at the time of her death the oldest person ever from Michigan having surpassed the age of Mary Kelly (1851-1964), a record she held until Jeralean Talley surpassed it In 2014.

==Birth and marriage==
Maude Farris was born in Morley, Michigan on February 21, 1887. She married Jason Farris, a farmer and laborer, in 1903. She was 16, he was 23. They lived in Angola, Indiana initially, later moving to Coldwater, Michigan in 1923.

==Family==
Maude had seven children, four sons and three daughters. She worked as a factory clerk, a hotel maid, a baker and a restaurant cook, retiring in her 70s. Her husband, Jason Farris, died at age 72 in 1951. Her second marriage to Walter Luse lasted only three years, ending with his death.
She had only 1 living child Lucille who died the next year, Maude also had 26 grandchildren, 85 great-grandchildren and 65 great-great-grandchildren.

She lived in Coldwater, Michigan, which is just North of the Northeast corner of Indiana, where she moved as a child in 1891, and from there moved to Coldwater sometime in the 1920s. She had a sister who lived to be 99 (two other siblings apparently died young). Her mother died at 87 but their Father was murdered at age 62 (and was the child of parents who both died young).

==Other==
She married a man who died aged nearly 74, and had a brother who died at 75. She was pictured at age 100 in a rare five-generation family photograph with each generation separated by exactly 25 years. In the picture with her are her son Clair at age 75, her grandson Donald at age 50, her great-granddaughter Cindy Coliver at age 25, and her great-great granddaughter Mallory who was born on Maude&#x27;s 100th birthday. Her children took after her husband&#x27;s longevity rather than hers. The firstborn died at 82, the others have all died at age 77 or less (one of whom died at only 28 and two did not survive infancy, the rest lived average to above average lifespans). The last-born by 15 years was the only survivor, and she was 75, ailing and died the next year.

&quot;If you stop and think about it, she&#x27;s seen the invention of the radio, the television, the space shuttle, she&#x27;s seen everything,&quot; said Granddaughter Susie Crandall, 53. Crandall said Maude could no longer speak or hear. &quot;I hold her hand and give her kisses and tell her that I love her, but she doesn&#x27;t appear to understand what&#x27;s going on,&quot; she said. &quot;If I could turn out to be half the woman that she&#x27;s been, I&#x27;d consider myself lucky.&quot; At age 93, her appendix burst, and some of her grandchildren feared then that she might die. Maude had lived in the nursing home since falling at home in 1991 and breaking her hip, when she was 104. She was still very healthy, said the marketing director of the Laurels at Coldwater Nursing Home. She still drank her milk every day and ate all her meals in the dining hall.

==Later years==
She had lived in the nursing home since falling at home in 1991 when she was 104 and breaking her hip. In later years, Maude became known for her big garden, for making pot holders by the dozen, and for her extreme generosity. When police caught some kids who broke into her house and stole money, Maude refused to press charges. &quot;She said &#x27;they probably needed it more than she did,&#x27;&quot; said Donald Ferris, a 64-year-old grandson. Maude never smoked or drank. She would drop anything to fish. Great-granddaughter Cindy Coliver of Jackson remembered being taken aback to see Maude scaling bluegills in her living room. Home remedies were another eccentricity. Maud often was yellow from mustard rubs. Farris-Luse never spent a day in a hospital until age 95. In her later years she was known as Maud Luse, having changed it legally. 

==Centenarian and supercentenarian years==
In 1997, at the age of 110, Luse wrote a letter to Jeanne Calment, the oldest person whose age has ever been validated. Calment died that same year, at age 122. With the death of Marie Brémont on June 6, 2001, Guinness editors declared Luse the world&#x27;s oldest person on June 23, 2001. In the absence of any birth certificate, they authenticated her age using U.S. Census Bureau records and her 1903 marriage license. On March 18, 2002, Luse died of pneumonia at 115, having outlived six of her seven children. Helen Farris, wife of Donald Farris, Sr., remembers one regret Maud expressed about living so long. &quot;Nobody calls her &#x27;Maud&#x27; any more,&quot; Helen said. &quot;Everyone calls her Mrs. Ferris or Grandma. She outlived everyone who called her Maud. So she lost that. It was a melancholy thought, if you dwell on it. So I hope no one is offended that I have taken the liberty of referring to potentially the-world&#x27;s-oldest-person by her first name. Well done, Maud.&quot;

<doc id="332966" wikidata="Q5773708" url="?curid=332966" title="Historic Washington State Park">
<text>Historic Washington State Park (formerly Old Washington Historic State Park) is a Arkansas state park in Hempstead County, Arkansas in the United States. The museum village contains a collection of pioneer artifacts from the town of Washington, Arkansas, which is a former pioneer settlement along the Southwest Trail. Walking interpretive tours are available throughout the 54 buildings. Washington served as a major trading point along the Southwest Trail, evolving into the Hempstead county seat and later the capital of Arkansas from 1863 to 1865 when Little Rock was threatened during the Civil War. The original plat of Washington was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 as the Washington Historic District.

During the 1820s and 1830s, Washington was a stopover for travelers going to Texas. It was originally the county seat of Hempstead County until a new courthouse was completed in Hope, which was designated the seat of government in 1939. The park emphasizes regional 19th century history from 1824 to 1889. It is located in southwestern Arkansas east of Texarkana and near the entrance to Interstate 30.

==History of Old Washington==
The Southwest Trail ran from St. Louis, Missouri, to the Red River port of Fulton in Hempstead County some twelve miles from Washington. At the time, the Red River was the border between the United States and Mexico. The trail was a route taken by people headed to Mexican Texas. William B. Travis, Sam Houston, and Davy Crockett each separately traveled through Washington on their way to Texas.

On February 14, 1820, Washington was authorized for a post office. That facility remains the oldest continuous postal operation west of the Mississippi River. A new postal building was dedicated on May 29, 1988, by then U.S. Senator David Hampton Pryor. Washington became a town on George Washington&#x27;s birthday, February 22, 1824.

From 1863-1865, Old Washington was the site of the Confederate capitol of Arkansas after the fall of Little Rock to Union forces. The original Arkansas Confederate capital, where the refugee government fled, still exists in the park. It is a part of the Camden Expedition Sites, named in part for the town of Camden, Arkansas, in southern Arkansas.

In 1958, the &quot;Pioneer Washington Restoration Foundation&quot; began preserving the unique buildings and sites that currently lie within the park. The park was established in 1965 and opened eight years later. The Southwest Regional Archives was established there in 1978. Since that time, more than 200,000 artifacts related to 19th century life have been recovered in the park and is the site of ongoing archaeological research on small-town life.

The historic buildings provide excellent examples of the architectural styles popular in the 19th century American South. Examples on display are Southern Greek Revival, Federal architecture, Gothic Revival, Italianate, and the rough-hewn timber or brace-frame construction of the frontier.

Visitors follow plank board sidewalks along streets that have never been paved. A Moon tree was planted in the town on March 15, 1976. The largest magnolia tree in Arkansas, planted in 1839, also graces the town. Everything within the original 1824 boundaries of the town are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Collections==
Historic Washington houses the Southwest Arkansas Regional Archives which is the primary center for historical and genealogical research in the region. The archives contain rare books, court documents, newspapers, census information, photographs, scrapbooks, sheet music, and assorted family histories.

<text>Margaret Eloise Knight (February 14, 1838 – October 12, 1914) was an American inventor, notably of a machine to produce flat-bottomed paper bags. She has been called &quot;the most famous 19th-century woman inventor&quot;. She founded the Eastern Paper Bag Company in 1870, creating paper bags for groceries similar in form to the ones that would be used in later generations. Knight received dozens of patents in different fields and became a symbol for women&#x27;s empowerment.

==Early life==
Margaret E. Knight was born in York, Maine on February 14, 1838, to Hannah Teal and James Knight. As a little girl, “Mattie,” as her parents and friends nicknamed her, preferred to play with woodworking tools instead of dolls, stating that “the only things [she] wanted were a jack knife, a gimlet, and pieces of wood.” She was known as a child for her kites and sleds.

Knight and her brothers, Charlie and Jim, were raised by their widowed mother; Knight&#x27;s father died when she was young, after which the impoverished family moved to Manchester, New Hampshire, where employment was available in the cotton mills. Any formal education she had was limited to secondary school, as she left to work in the mills at age 12 with her siblings.

12-year-old Knight witnessed an accident at the mill in which a worker was stabbed by a steel-tipped shuttle that shot out of a mechanical loom. Within weeks she invented a safety device for the loom, which was later adopted by other Manchester mills. The device was never patented and its exact nature is unknown, though it may have been either a device to stop the loom when the shuttle thread broke or a guard to physically block a flying shuttle.

Health problems precluded Knight from continuing to work at the cotton mill. In her teens and early 20s she held several jobs, including in home repair, daguerreotype photography, engraving, and furniture upholstery.

==Career==
Knight&#x27;s first patent, issued in 1870, was for an &quot;improvement in paper-feeding machines&quot;, a &quot;pneumatic paper-feeder&quot; with applications in printing presses and paper-folding machines; her paper bag machine would feature a three-step folding process in forming the flat bottom. At the time, many female inventors and writers concealed their gender by using only an initial instead of their given name, but Margaret E. Knight was identified in this patent.

=== Flat-bottomed paper bag machine ===
Knight moved to Springfield, Massachusetts in 1867 and was hired by the Columbia Paper Bag Company. She noticed that the envelope-shaped machine-made paper bags they produced were weak and narrow, and could not stand on their bases. They were also poorly suited to bulky items, such as groceries and hardware goods. Machines for producing these envelope-style bags were the subject of three patents issued to Francis Wolle in 1852, 1855, and 1858. Flat-bottomed paper bags, which were sturdier and more useful, were expensively made by hand.

Such flat-bottomed bags were already in general use in Britain since at least the 1840s and improvements to hand-production techniques occurred during the 1850s. For example, a patent was awarded to James Baldwin of Birmingham in 1853 for semi-mechanized apparatus to use in the making of flat-bottomed paper bags. However, thinking to more fully automate the process, in 1868 Knight invented a machine that cut, folded, and glued paper to form the flat-bottomed brown paper bag familiar to shoppers today. This machine enabled the mass manufacture of flat-bottomed bags, increasing the speed of production. 

Knight built a wooden prototype of the device, but needed a working iron model to apply for a patent. Charles Annan (or Anan), a machinist who visited the machine shop where Knight&#x27;s iron model was being built, stole her design and patented it first. When Knight attempted to patent her work, she discovered Annan&#x27;s patent and filed a patent interference lawsuit in the fall of 1870. Annan argued that &quot;she could not possibly understand the mechanical complexities of the machine&quot;, possibly exploiting prejudice against women, and/or that his was a different machine (likely on the basis of details he had misremembered), and that she had not succeeded in creating a working machine. Some authors, such as Ryan Smith of the Smithsonian Magazine, state Annan argued no woman could have designed the machine, though according to Michael Abrams of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, this is a modern exaggeration of Annan&#x27;s sole argument that his was a different machine. Knight responded with copious evidence in the form of meticulous hand-drawn blueprints, journals, and models, and a number of witnesses who testified that she had been making drawings and models beginning in 1867. She spent the then-large sum of $100 () per day in legal costs for the 16-day hearing, which resulted in victory. She received her patent in 1871.

For her invention of the paper bag machine, Knight was decorated by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in 1871.

With a Massachusetts business partner, Knight established the Eastern Paper Bag Company in Hartford, Connecticut. Having no interest in managing a business, she instead received royalties from the Eastern Paper Bag Company and continued to work as an inventor. She acquired a further patent in 1879 for improvements to the paper bag machine. It was also assigned to Eastern. Though Knight earned a comfortable income from her paper bag royalties, they were however capped at $25,000 and therefore ended after a time. She would continue in this pattern for the rest of her career, selling her various inventions to companies to live on royalties and patent sales.

Knight moved to Ashland and then Framingham, Massachusetts, working in an office in downtown Boston.

=== Later inventions ===
In the 1880s Knight designed three domestic inventions. She patented a dress and skirt shield in 1883, a clasp for robes in 1884, and a cooking spit in 1885. In the 1880s and 1890s Knight worked on machines for manufacturing shoes, receiving six patents for several machines used in cutting shoe materials. In the early 1900s Knight developed several components for rotary engines and motors, with patents being granted in 1902 to 1915 (after her death). Her understanding of this work was unfortunately limited by her lack of education.

Her many other inventions include two patents of 1894: a numbering machine, and a window frame and sash. In total she was granted at least 27 and possibly 30 patents, though she also invented many devices she did not patent.

== Later life ==
Knight continued her work late into life. A 1913 article in The New York Times reported that she was &quot;working twenty hours a day on her eighty-ninth invention.&quot;

Knight was never wealthy, though she lived more comfortably as an adult than in childhood. Knight never married and died alone on October 12, 1914, at the age of 76, leaving an estate worth only $275.05.

== Legacy ==

As a female inventor, Knight faced certain challenges and limits. At the time Knight patented her paper bag machine women held a tiny fraction of patents. In 2019 fewer than 10% of primary inventor patent holders were female.

An obituary described Knight as a &quot;woman Edison&quot;. Late in her life, Knight was recognized as a leader among women, her achievements held as an example by women&#x27;s rights activists and suffragettes. She was profiled in several pro-suffrage newspapers and magazines alongside other women inventors as &quot;lady Edisons&quot;. She was featured in a 1913 New York Times article, &quot;Women Who Are Inventors,&quot; which rebutted the idea of female intellectual inferiority. The 1913 article was written in response to a certain physician&#x27;s controversial opinion that women had their place in literature but were not inventive; he pointed to the few women recorded as eminent artists, composers, inventors or even professions thought feminine, such as chefs and fashion designers. The article responded that women had been sequestered in domestic work and denied creative opportunities, and pointed to nine women inventors of the day, Knight foremost among them.

A plaque recognizing her as the &quot;first woman awarded a U.S. patent&quot; and holder of 87 U.S. patents hangs on the Curry Cottage at 287 Hollis St in Framingham. However, Knight was not actually the first: either Mary Kies, Hannah Slater, or Hazel Irwin, who received a patent for a cheese press in 1808, holds that honor.

The flat-bottomed paper bag machine was Knight&#x27;s most successful invention. Knight&#x27;s bags differed somewhat from modern ones. They did not have accordion-folded sides like modern bags, which are therefore more compact in storage and have more defined corners; Luther Crowell patented an accordion-pleated bag in 1872. Another feature developed later was easy unfolding into a square-bottomed shape. Paper bags replaced cloth sacks, crates, and boxes for shopping, and were standard for nearly a century before being replaced by disposable plastic bags, for which a cheap manufacturing process was developed in the 1970s and 80s.

Knight was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006. A scaled-down but fully functional patent model of her original bag-making machine is in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="332982" wikidata="Q392130" url="?curid=332982" title="Swedish Hockey League">
<text>The Swedish Hockey League (SHL; ) is a professional ice hockey league, and the highest division in the Swedish ice hockey system. The league currently consists of 14 teams. The league was founded in 1975, and while Swedish ice hockey champions have been crowned through various formats since 1922, the title and the Le Mat Trophy have been awarded to the winner of the SHL playoffs since the league&#x27;s inaugural 1975–76 season.

The league was founded in 1975 as the Elitserien (known in English as the Swedish Elite League or SEL), and initially featured 10 teams, though this was expanded to 12 for the 1987–88 season. The league was renamed the SHL in 2013, and in 2014, a number of format changes were announced, including an expansion to 14 teams to be finalized prior to the 2015–16 season, and a new format for promotion from and relegation to HockeyAllsvenskan, the second tier league.

Teams from the SHL participate in the IIHF&#x27;s annual Champions Hockey League (CHL), competing for the European Trophy. Participation is based on the strength of the various leagues in Europe (excluding the European/Asian Kontinental Hockey League). Going into the 2022–23 CHL season, the SHL was ranked the No. 1 league in Europe, allowing them to send their top five teams to compete in the CHL.

==History==

The Swedish Ice Hockey Championship was awarded for the first time in 1922, only two years after ice hockey was introduced in Sweden by the American film director Raoul Le Mat. At this point, the Swedish Championships were held as a separate tournament. It was not until the 1952–53 season that the championship was awarded to the winner of the top-tier hockey league, which at the time was Division I.

===Expansion===
The inaugural Elitserien season began on 5 October 1975, with the league consisting of 10 teams, each playing one another four times—two at home and two on the road—for a total of 36 games. There has been extensive discussion about the number of teams in the SHL. The league had 12 teams for over 20 years since an expansion from 10 teams in 1987, however, there was general agreement among hockey experts that the league needed to be expanded by at least two more teams. They meant that, apart from just the economic situation for some of the clubs, the competition from HockeyAllsvenskan had shown that more teams were needed in the top-tier league SHL. On 13 March 2014, the SHL and HockeyAllsvenskan announced that the SHL would be expanded to 14 teams, starting in the 2015–16 season. To make this change happen, at least two HockeyAllsvenskan teams would be promoted to the SHL in the 2014–15 season.

===European-level play===
In 2009, Håkan Loob, the general manager of Färjestad BK, sent a letter to Alexander Medvedev, the owner and president of the Russian Kontinental Hockey League, on behalf of five SHL teams – Färjestad, Frölunda, Djurgården, Linköping and HV71 – that were reportedly &quot;interested in discussing the future of European hockey&quot;. It was believed that these five teams had intended to leave the SHL league after the 2009–10 season; they terminated their shareholders&#x27; agreements with &quot;Hockeyligan&quot;, the name at that time for the SHL&#x27;s interest organisation. The teams also formed an interest group to investigate the possibility of forming a continental hockey league spanning several European countries. These plans were abandoned in November 2011, however, with Frölunda&#x27;s chairman expressing hopes for the future of the European Trophy (which was disbanded with the formation of the Champions Hockey League in 2013).

===Renaming===
On 17 June 2013, the league was renamed &quot;Svenska hockeyligan&quot;, since this would allow for an easy English translation (&quot;Swedish Hockey League&quot;) and a common acronym in the two languages (&quot;SHL&quot;), all of which was considered to be a better brand identity for investment.

==Game==
Each regular season SHL game is composed of three 20-minute periods, with an intermission of a maximum of 18 minutes between periods. If the game is tied following the 60-minute regulation time, a five-minute three-on-three sudden death overtime period is played. If a game still is tied after the overtime period, a shootout decides the game. In a shootout, the team that scores the most penalty shots out of three attempts wins the game. If the game is still tied after the first three penalty-shot rounds, the shootout continues round by round, until one team scores while the other team fails to score.

During each period, there is one 70-second &quot;power break&quot; used to display commercials; each commercial is played after the first stoppage of play at least 10 minutes into the period. Power breaks do not, however, take place directly after a goal, penalty shot, icing call or during a powerplay.

===Playoff games===
In the event of a tied game during the playoffs, additional 20-minute overtime periods are played perpetually until one team scores. Unlike in the regular season, playoff overtime periods are played five-on-five. Only one game in Sweden has ever surpassed four full overtime periods, and no SHL games have surpassed three full overtime periods. The longest SHL game was the first game of the 1997 Swedish Championship semifinals, played on 23 March 1997 between Leksands IF and Färjestad BK. 6,012 spectators saw Andreas Karlsson score the game-winning goal for Leksand after 59 minutes of overtime (almost three full overtime periods). See Longest ice hockey games in Sweden for other games.

SHL games are played on an ice hockey rink, which is rectangular ice rink with rounded corners and surrounded by a wall. It measures 30 by 60 meters (98.42 by 196.85 ft), conforming to international standards.

==Teams==

Counting from the formation of the SHL in 1975, Färjestad BK is the most successful team with ten Swedish Championship titles. Brynäs IF and Djurgårdens IF are tied for the second most successful team with six championship titles. Counting from 1922, when the first Swedish championships were played, Djurgårdens IF is the most successful team with sixteen championship titles, followed by Brynäs IF with thirteen, as well as Färjestad BK with ten and IK Göta with nine.

=== 2024–25 season ===

==Season structure==
The SHL season is divided into a regular season from late September through the beginning of March, when teams play against each other in a pre-defined schedule, and a playoffs from March to April, which is an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a best-of-seven series in order to advance to the next round. The final remaining team is crowned the Swedish champion, or &quot;Svenska mästare&quot; in Swedish, and receives the Le Mat Trophy.

===Regular season===
The regular season is a round-robin, where each team plays 52 games. Points are awarded for each game, where three points are awarded for winning in regulation time, two points for winning in overtime or shootout, one point for losing in overtime or shootout, and zero points for losing in regulation time. At the end of the regular season, the team that finishes with the most points is crowned the league champion and is awarded a prize sum of 1,000,000 SEK (approx. US$150,000) as a bonus. The six highest-ranked teams by points qualify directly for the playoffs. The four teams ranked 7–10 play a best-of-three series and battle for the two remaining playoff spots. The two lowest-ranked teams after the regular season have to play in the relegation and promotion series Kvalserien in order to qualify for the next season of the SHL. Before the 2013–14 season, the eight highest-ranked teams qualified for the playoffs.

If two or more teams end up tied in points, the seeds are determined by the following tiebreaker format:
#Best goal difference
#Most goals scored
#Head-to-head results between the tied teams

===Playoffs===
The SHL playoffs are an elimination tournament consisting of multi-game series where two teams battle to win a best-of-three or best-of-seven series in order to advance to the next round. The playoffs consist of four rounds: The eighth finals, the quarterfinals, the semifinals and the finals. In the first round, the eighth finals (known as Play In before the 2015–16 season), the 7th-ranked team from the regular season is paired against the 10th-ranked team and the 8th-ranked team is paired against the 9th-ranked team. In the quarterfinals, the six best teams from the regular season and the two winners of the eighth finals are paired seed-wise against each other, with the highest seed playing the lowest-remaining seed. In the semifinals, the teams are re-seeded, with the top remaining seed playing against the lowest remaining seed, and the other two remaining teams pairing off. In the finals, the two remaining teams face each other to determine the Swedish ice hockey champions. Before the 2013–14 season, the top-tier teams got to choose their opponents in the quarterfinals.

The eighth finals are played as best-of-three series while the other rounds are played as best-of-seven series. In each series, the higher-ranked team of the two has home-ice advantage. Each series is played in an alternating home-away format, with the first game played at the higher seed&#x27;s home venue. Any given series ends when one team has won more than half the maximum number of games needed to decide the series.

===Relegation===
The two lowest ranked teams after the regular season have to play in a best-of-seven relegation series called Kvalserien, with the higher-ranked team having home-ice advantage. The winning team remains in the SHL, while the losing team is relegated to the second-tier league, HockeyAllsvenskan. The champion of HockeyAllsvenskan is promoted to the SHL, taking the place of the relegated team.

==Attendance==
In the 2010–11 season, the SHL was the world&#x27;s most evenly matched professional ice hockey league. During the 2011–12 season, the SHL was the most well attended ice hockey league in Europe, averaging 6,385 spectators per game, however in 2013–14, the SHL was third best in Europe, with an attendance average of 5,978. The SHL was the second most popular sports team league within Sweden, after the football league Allsvenskan, which in the 2013 season had an average attendance of 7,627.

Between 2009 and 2013, the league hosted an outdoor game in the regular season in December every year. The first outdoor game was played on 28 December 2009, between Frölunda HC and Färjestad BK at Ullevi. Frölunda came out on top with a 4–1 victory. 31,144 spectators saw the game, setting a new record for the largest attendance at an ice hockey league match in Sweden. The following year, Färjestad and Frölunda met again in an outdoor game, this time in Karlstad. Färjestad won the game 5–2 in front of 15,274 spectators. The 2013 outdoor game was played on 14 December 2013, between Frölunda HC and Skellefteå AIK at Gamla Ullevi. The game was promoted as &quot;Julmatchen&quot; (English: &quot;The Christmas game&quot;) and was won by Skellefteå 4–1 in front of 13,452 spectators.

==Notable players==
Three players in SHL history have been awarded the Golden Puck, as ice hockey player of the year in Sweden, more than once; Anders Andersson, Leif Holmqvist and Peter Forsberg have all won it twice.

The top five career scorers in the SHL are Johan Davidsson (561 points), Fredrik Bremberg (501), Håkan Loob (500), Stefan Nilsson (489) and Ove Molin (484). The top three career goal scorers are Håkan Loob (263 goals), Magnus Wernblom (241) and Peter Gradin (214). Joel Lundqvist, Jan Sandström and Johan Davidsson are the leaders in the number of SHL regular season games played, with Lundqvist having played 812 games, Sandström 800 and Davidsson 776.

The top three point-scoring forwards for the 2021–22 season were Ryan Lasch (66 points), Max Véronneau (60) and Linus Omark (58). Véronneau was the top goal-scorers and thus the Håkan Loob Trophy winner, with 34 goals. The top three point-scorers on defence were Jonathan Pudas (44 points), Joel Persson (39) and Joey LaLeggia (38). The top three goaltenders by save percentage among those who played more than 40% of their team&#x27;s minutes were Jhonas Enroth (.923), Christoffer Rifalk (.921) and Gustaf Lindvall (.920).

==Trophies and awards==

The winning team of the SHL playoffs is named Swedish Champions and awarded the Le Mat Trophy. There is only one trophy that is awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season; the Håkan Loob Trophy for the goal-scoring leader.

One of the most prestigious individual awards is Guldhjälmen, which is awarded annually to the Most Valuable Player. The voting is conducted by the players in the SHL. Guldpucken is awarded annually to the ice hockey player of the year in Sweden. It is not necessarily awarded to a player in the SHL; for the 2005–06 season the award was given to Kenny Jönsson in the Swedish second-tier ice hockey league HockeyAllsvenskan. The award Årets Rookie (Rookie of the Year) is awarded annually by &quot;Svenska Spel&quot; and &quot;Svenska Hockeyligan&quot; to the best rookie player in the SHL.

Starting in 2010, an annual playoff MVP was acknowledged. The playoff MVP award was later renamed the Stefan Liv Memorial Trophy in honour of Swedish goalkeeper Stefan Liv after his death in the 2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash.

==Television and radio==
SHL games are broadcast nationally in Sweden by TV4 and streamed on TV4 Play. Selected games are shown in Finland by C More and in Norway by VG+. One game from each round is presented as the &quot;Flagship Game&quot; and shown on TV4 Hockey with a studio show before, between the periods and after the game. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, SHL games were being broadcast in Canada by Rogers Sportsnet. In the beginning of the 2023-24 season it was announced that all games would be available on HomeofHockey.tv in the US, UK, Canada, Ireland, Netherlands, Italy, Belgium and Spain with one selected game having English commentary.

Sveriges Radio (SR) is the official radio broadcaster of the SHL. Each round is covered by &quot;Sportextra&quot; in SR P4 with reports from all arenas; all games are available in their entirety on SR&#x27;s internet radio and to mobile phones via 3G.

<text>Mary Dixon Kies (March 21, 1752 – 1837) was an American inventor. On May 5, 1809, her patent for a new technique of weaving straw with silk and thread to make hats was signed by President James Madison.

Some sources say she was the first woman to receive a US patent, however other sources cite Hannah Slater in 1793, or Hazel Irwin, who received a patent for a cheese press in 1808, as the first. 
==Biography==

===Family life===
Mary&#x27;s father, John Dixon, was a farmer born in 1679 in Ulster, Ireland. Her mother, Janet Kennedy, was John Dixon&#x27;s third wife. They had married in Voluntown, Connecticut on August 7, 1741.

Mary Dixon was born in Killingly, Connecticut on March 21, 1752. She married Isaac Pike I, and in 1770 they had a son, Isaac Pike II. After his death she married John Kies (1750–1813) who died on August 18, 1813, at age 63. She then lived with her second son, Daniel Kies, in Brooklyn, New York, until her death at age 85 in 1837.

=== The Hat-Making Industry ===
Mary Kies was not the first inventor of the hat, nor was she the first female to enter into the hat-making business. In 1798, Betsy Metcalf had created her own straw-braiding method. At that time, women could not even own property, let alone petition for a patent. Metcalf employed many women to make her hats, however, when she was asked why she never patented her process, she said she didn&#x27;t want her name being sent to Congress. The problem that both Betsy Metcalf and Mary Kies were trying to solve was a need in the market for affordable, durable hats. 

===Invention===
Because of the Napoleonic Wars, the United States had embargoed all trade with France and Great Britain, creating a need for American-made hats to replace European millinery. Since the United States had stopped importing European goods, the U.S. government had encouraged an increase in domestic manufacturing. The straw-weaving industry filled the gap, with over $500,000 ($4.7 million in today&#x27;s money) worth of straw bonnets produced in Massachusetts alone in 1810. 

Mary Kies received her patent on May 5, 1809, for a new technique of weaving straw with silk and thread to make hats.

The hats produced with this technique were sturdier than others, because Kies’ method of using silk instead of straws in the seam held the cross-hatching together. Also, the hat-making method she introduced was highly cost-effective; thus, a lot of businesses in the hat-manufacturing market adopted it. Manufacturers kept producing Kies&#x27; method, even after her patent was burned in the fire of the Patent Office in 1836. 

Thanks to Kies invention, the hat industry thrived, even during the War of 1812. However, Kies made very little profit from her sales. Kies had hoped to profit from her invention, however, after the death of her husband John Kies, she moved in with her son Daniel Kies. He tried to help through investing, but Kies ultimately died penniless due to changes in fashion trends which made her invention obsolete.

=== Impact ===
Even though Mary Kies invention itself did not have a lasting impact, her legacy is one that opened doors for future generations of female inventors and deserves to be recognized.

Mary Kies was one of the first women to receive a U.S. patent, despite the controversy if she was actually the first. Up until 1790, women weren&#x27;t even able to apply for and receive a U.S. patent and it wasn&#x27;t until the Patent Act of 1790 that women could receive a patent. The Patent Act stated that &quot;any &quot;person&quot; or &quot;persons&quot;&quot; could apply for a patent. It is also thought that the first woman to receive a U.S. Patent was Hannah Wilkinson Slater, as she was issued a patent in 1793. However, the patent was issued to “Mrs. Samuel Slater,” rather than Hannah, causing people to believe that Mary Kies was the first female to receive a patent. 

Regardless, Mary Kies was essential in paving the way for other women to even be able to receive a patent. Her legacy was recognized by Killingly Grange No. 112, after the members learned that Mary Kies died with little to her name and her grave was marked with an uninscribed headstone. The group took to honoring her with a new headstone in Old South Killingly cemetery as the first woman in the United States to apply for and receive a patent. 

Mary Kies was also inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006 for her achievement. The National Inventors Hall of Fame praises her for her process for weaving straw with silk or thread and for being the first woman to apply for and receive a patent, specifically in her own name. 

Today, over twelve percent of all patent applications include a woman inventor. This number has steadily grown since 1840 when there were approximately 20 U.S. patents issued to women for inventions that were mostly related to cooking, tools, and clothing.

===Recognition===
Dolley Madison sent a letter praising Kies for her invention. In 1802, the first official U.S. Patent Office was established, making Mary Kies invention especially timely, as the United States was attempting to maintain neutrality and had stopped importing European goods. This is believed to be the reason for Madison&#x27;s letter, as Kies invention contributed to both the hat industry and benefitted the United States government.

<text>Vegetative reproduction (also known as vegetative propagation, vegetative multiplication or cloning) is a form of asexual reproduction occurring in plants in which a new plant grows from a fragment or cutting of the parent plant or specialized reproductive structures, which are sometimes called vegetative propagules.

Many plants naturally reproduce this way, but it can also be induced artificially. Horticulturists have developed asexual propagation techniques that use vegetative propagules to replicate plants. Success rates and difficulty of propagation vary greatly. Monocotyledons typically lack a vascular cambium, making them more challenging to propagate.

==Plant propagation==
Plant propagation is the process of plant reproduction of a species or cultivar, and it can be sexual or asexual. It can happen through the use of vegetative parts of the plants, such as leaves, stems, and roots to produce new plants or through growth from specialized vegetative plant parts.

While many plants reproduce by vegetative reproduction, they rarely exclusively use that method to reproduce. Vegetative reproduction is not evolutionary advantageous; it does not allow for genetic diversity and could lead plants to accumulate deleterious mutations. Vegetative reproduction is favored when it allows plants to produce more offspring per unit of resource than reproduction through seed production. In general, juveniles of a plant are easier to propagate vegetatively.

Although most plants normally reproduce sexually, many can reproduce vegetatively, or can be induced to do so via hormonal treatments. This is because meristematic cells capable of cellular differentiation are present in many plant tissues.

Vegetative propagation is usually considered a cloning method. However, root cuttings of thornless blackberries (&quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot;) will revert to thorny type because the adventitious shoot develops from a cell that is genetically thorny. Thornless blackberry is a chimera, with the epidermal layers genetically thornless but the tissue beneath it genetically thorny.

Grafting is often not a complete cloning method because seedlings are used as rootstocks. In that case, only the top of the plant is clonal. In some crops, particularly apples, the rootstocks are vegetatively propagated so the entire graft can be clonal if the scion and rootstock are both clones. Apomixis (including apospory and diplospory) is a type of reproduction that does not involve fertilization. In flowering plants, unfertilized seeds are produced, or plantlets that grow instead of flowers. Hawkweed (&quot;Hieracium&quot;), dandelion (&quot;Taraxacum&quot;), some citrus (&quot;Citrus&quot;) and many grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass (&quot;Poa pratensis&quot;) all use this form of asexual reproduction. Bulbils are sometimes formed instead of the flowers of garlic.

== Mechanisms ==
Meristem tissue makes the process of asexual reproduction possible. It is normally found in stems, leaves, and tips of stems and roots and consists of undifferentiated cells that are constantly dividing allowing for plant growth and give rise to plant tissue systems. The meristem tissue&#x27;s ability to continuously divide allows for vegetative propagation to occur.

Another important ability that allows for vegetative propagation is the ability to develop adventitious roots which arise from other vegetative parts of the plants such as the stem or leaves. These roots allow for the development of new plants from body parts from other plants.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

=== Advantages ===
There are several advantages of vegetative reproduction, mainly that the produced offspring are clones of their parent plants. If a plant has favorable traits, it can continue to pass down its advantageous genetic information to its offspring. It can be economically beneficial for commercial growers to clone a certain plant to ensure consistency throughout their crops. Vegetative propagation also allows plants to avoid the costly and complex process of producing sexual reproduction organs such as flowers and the subsequent seeds and fruits. Developing an ace cultivar is extremely difficult, so, once farmers develop the desired traits in, for example, a lily, they use grafting and budding to ensure the consistency of the new cultivar and its successful production on a commercial level. However, as can be seen in many variegated plants, this does not always apply, because many plants actually are chimeras and cuttings might reflect the attributes of only one or some of the parent cell lines. Vegetative propagation also allows plants to circumvent the immature seedling phase and reach the mature phase faster. In nature, that increases the chances for a plant to successfully reach maturity, and, commercially, it saves farmers a lot of time and money as it allows for faster crop overturn.

Vegetative reproduction offers research advantages in several areas of biology and has practical usage when it comes to afforestation. The most common use made of vegetative propagation by forest geneticists and tree breeders has been to move genes from selected trees to some convenient location, usually designated a gene bank, clone bank, clone-holding orchard, or seed orchard where their genes can be recombined in pedigreed offspring.

Some analyses suggest that vegetative reproduction is a characteristic which makes a plant species more likely to become invasive. Since vegetative reproduction is often faster than sexual reproduction, it &quot;quickly increases populations and may contribute to recovery following disturbance&quot; (such as fires and floods).

=== Disadvantages ===
A major disadvantage of vegetative propagation is that it prevents species genetic diversity which can lead to reductions in crop yields. The plants are genetically identical and are all, therefore, susceptible to pathogenic plant viruses, bacteria and fungi that can wipe out entire crops.

== Types ==

=== Natural means ===
Natural vegetative propagation is mostly a process found in herbaceous and woody perennial plants, and typically involves structural modifications of the stem, although any horizontal, underground part of a plant (whether stem, leaf, or root) can contribute to vegetative reproduction of a plant. Most plant species that survive and significantly expand by vegetative reproduction would be perennial almost by definition, since specialized organs of vegetative reproduction, like seeds of annuals, serve to survive seasonally harsh conditions. A plant that persists in a location through vegetative reproduction of individuals over a long period of time constitutes a clonal colony.

In a sense, this process is not one of reproduction but one of survival and expansion of biomass of the individual. When an individual organism increases in size via cell multiplication and remains intact, the process is called &quot;vegetative growth&quot;. However, in vegetative reproduction, the new plants that result are new individuals in almost every respect except genetic. Of considerable interest is how this process appears to reset the aging clock.

As previously mentioned, plants vegetatively propagate both artificially and naturally. Most common methods of natural vegetative reproduction involve the development of a new plant from specialized structures of a mature plant. In addition to adventitious roots, roots that arise from plant structures other than the root, such as stems or leaves, modified stems, leaves and roots play an important role in plants&#x27; ability to naturally propagate. The most common modified stems, leaves and roots that allow for vegetative propagation are:

==== Runners ====

Also known as stolons, runners are modified stems that, unlike rhizomes, grow from existing stems just below the soil surface. As they are propagated, the buds on the modified stems produce roots and stems. Those buds are more separated than the ones found on the rhizome.

Examples of plants that use runners are strawberries and currants.

==== Bulbs ====
Bulbs are inflated parts of the stem within which lie the central shoots of new plants. They are typically underground and are surrounded by plump and layered leaves that provide nutrients to the new plant.

Examples of plants that use bulbs are shallots, lilies and tulips.

==== Tubers ====
Tubers develop from either the stem or the root. Stem tubers grow from rhizomes or runners that swell from storing nutrients while root tubers propagate from roots that are modified to store nutrients and get too large and produce a new plant.

Examples of stem tubers are potatoes and yams and examples of root tubers are sweet potatoes and dahlias.

==== Corms ====
Corms are solid enlarged underground stems that store nutrients in their fleshy and solid stem tissue and are surrounded by papery leaves. Corms differ from bulbs in that their centers consists of solid tissue while bulbs consist of layered leaves.

Examples of plants that use corms are gladiolus and taro.

==== Suckers ====
Also known as root sprouts, suckers are plant stems that arise from buds on the base of the parent plant&#x27;s stems or roots.

Examples of plants that use suckers are apple, elm, and banana trees.

==== Plantlets ====
Plantlets are miniature structures that arise from meristem in leaf margins that eventually develops roots and drop from the leaves they grew on.

An example of a plant that uses plantlets is the &quot;Bryophyllum daigremontianum&quot; (syn. &quot;Kalanchoe daigremontianum&quot;), which is also known as &quot;mother of thousands&quot; for its many plantlets.

==== Keikis ====
Keikis are additional offshoots which develop on vegetative stems or flower stalks of several orchids genera.

Examples of plants that use keikis are the &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot;, &quot;Epidendrum&quot;, and &quot;Dendrobium&quot; genera of orchids.

==== Apomixis ====
Apomixis is the process of asexual reproduction through seed, in the absence of meiosis and fertilization, generating clonal progeny of maternal origin.

=== Artificial means ===
Vegetative propagation of particular cultivars that have desirable characteristics is very common practice. It is used by farmers and horticulturalists to produce better crops with desirable qualities. The most common methods of artificial vegetative propagation are:

==== Cutting ====
A cutting is a part of the plant, usually a stem or a leaf, is cut off and planted. Adventitious roots grow from cuttings and a new plant eventually develops. Usually those cuttings are treated with hormones before being planted to induce growth.

==== Grafting ====
Grafting involves attaching a scion, or a desired cutting, to the stem of another plant called stock that remains rooted in the ground. Eventually both tissue systems become grafted or integrated and a plant with the characteristics of the grafted plant develops, e.g. mango, guava, etc.

==== Layering ====
Layering is a process which includes the bending of plant branches or stems so that they touch the ground and are covered with soil. Adventitious roots develop from the underground part of the plant, which is known as the layer. This method of vegetative reproduction also occurs naturally. Another similar method, air layering, involved the scraping and replanting of tree branches which develop into trees. Examples are Jasmine and Bougainvillea.

==== Suckering ====
Suckers grow and form a dense compact mat that is attached to the parent plant. Too many suckers can lead to smaller crop size, so excess suckers are pruned, and mature suckers are transplanted to a new area where they develop into new plants.

==== Tissue culture ====
In tissue culture, plant cells are taken from various parts of the plant and are cultured and nurtured in a sterilized medium. The mass of developed tissue, known as the callus, is then cultured in a hormone-ladened medium and eventually develops into plantlets which are then planted and eventually develop into grown plants.

An offset is the lower part of a single culm with the rhizome axis basal to it and its roots. Planting of these is the most convenient way of propagating bamboo.

<text>A state highway, state road, or state route (and the equivalent provincial highway, provincial road, or provincial route) is usually a road that is either numbered or maintained by a sub-national state or province. A road numbered by a state or province falls below numbered national highways (Canada being a notable exception to this rule) in the hierarchy (route numbers are used to aid navigation, and may or may not indicate ownership or maintenance). 

Roads maintained by a state or province include both nationally numbered highways and un-numbered state highways. Depending on the state, &quot;state highway&quot; may be used for one meaning and &quot;state road&quot; or &quot;state route&quot; for the other.

In some countries such as New Zealand, the word &quot;state&quot; is used in its sense of a sovereign state or country. By this meaning a state highway is a road maintained and numbered by the national government rather than local authorities.

==By country==

===Australia===
Australia&#x27;s important urban and inter-regional routes not covered by the National Highway or National Route systems are marked under the State Route system. They can be recognised by blue shield markers. They were practically adopted in all states by the end of the 1980s, and in some states, some less important National Routes were downgraded to State Routes. Each state has or had its own numbering scheme, but do not duplicate National Route numbers in the same state, or nearby routes in another state.

As with the National Routes and National Highways, State Routes are being phased out in most states and territories in favour of alphanumeric routes. However, despite the fact that Victoria has fully adopted alphanumeric routes in regional areas, state route numbers are still used extensively within the city of Melbourne as a part of its Metropolitan Route Numbering Scheme.

===Brazil===

Brazil is another country that is divided into states and has state highways. For example, the longest highway in the state of São Paulo, the Rodovia Raposo Tavares, is designated as SP-270 and SP-295.

===Canada===


Canada is divided into provinces and territories, each of which maintains its own system of provincial or territorial highways, which form the majority of the country&#x27;s highway network. There is also the national transcontinental Trans-Canada Highway system, which is marked by distinct signs, but has no uniform numeric designation across the country. In the eastern provinces, for instance, an unnumbered (though sometimes with a named route branch) Trans-Canada route marker is co-signed with a numbered provincial sign, with the provincial route often continuing alone outside the Trans-Canada Highway section. However, in the western provinces, the two parallel Trans-Canada routes are consistently numbered with Trans-Canada route markers; as Highways 1 and 16 respectively.

Canada also has a designated National Highway System, but the system is completely unsigned, aside from the Trans-Canada routes. This makes Canada unique in that national highway designations are generally secondary to subnational routes.
===Germany===

In Germany, state roads (&quot;&quot; or ) are a road class which is ranking below the federal road network (). The responsibility for road planning, construction and maintenance is vested in the federal states of Germany.

Most federal states use the term (marked with &#x27;L&#x27;), while for historical reasons Saxony and Bavaria use the term (marked with &#x27;S&#x27;). The appearance of the shields differs from state to state.

The term should not be confused with , which describes every road outside built-up areas and is not a road class.

===Italy===


The Strade Statali, abbreviated SS, is the Italian national network of state highways. The total length for the network is about . The Italian state highway network are maintained by ANAS. From 1928 until 1946 state highways were maintained by Azienda Autonoma Statale della Strada (AASS). The next level of roads below Strada Statali is Strada Regionale (&quot;regional roads&quot;). The routes of some state highways derive from ancient Roman roads, such as the Strada statale 7 Via Appia, which broadly follows the route of the Roman road of the same name. Other examples are the Strada statale 1 Via Aurelia (Via Aurelia) and the Strada statale 4 Via Salaria (Via Salaria).

Since the reforms following the birth of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, the State took charge of the construction and maintenance of a primary network of roads for connections between the main cities; in 1865 the Lanza law introduced the classification of roads between national, provincial and municipal (see Annex F, art.10) and the Royal Decree of 17 November 1865, n. 2633 listed the first 38 national roads.

Italian state highways are identified by a number and a name. In road signs and maps the number is preceded by the acronym SS, an acronym for &quot;strada statale&quot; (&quot;state road&quot;). The nomenclature of the state highways managed by ANAS generally follows the SS &quot;n&quot; scheme, where &quot;n&quot; is a number ranging from 1 (Aurelia) up to 700 (of the Royal Palace of Caserta) depending on the date of establishment of the state highway. Newly built ANAS roads, not yet classified, are identified by the acronym NSA, an acronym for &quot;nuova strada ANAS&quot; (&quot;new ANAS road&quot;).

State highways can be technically defined as main extra-urban roads (type B road) or as secondary extra-urban roads (type C road). State highways that cross towns with a population of at least 10,000 inhabitants are urban roads (type D and E) under the jurisdiction of the relevant municipalities. The state highway that cross towns or villages with a population of less than 10,000 inhabitants are urban roads (type D and E) under the jurisdiction of the municipality, subject to authorization from ANAS.

Notable state highways in Italy are the Strada statale 1 Via Aurelia, the Strada statale 4 Via Salaria, the Strada statale 4 dir, Strada statale 7 Via Appia, the Strada statale 12 dell&#x27;Abetone e del Brennero, the Strada statale 18 Tirrena Inferiore, the Strada statale 35 dei Giovi, the Strada statale 36 del Lago di Como e dello Spluga, the Strada statale 37 del Maloja, the Strada statale 38 dello Stelvio, the Strada statale 44 del Passo di Giovo, the Strada statale 44 bis Passo del Rombo, the Strada statale 48 delle Dolomiti, the Strada statale 72 di San Marino, the Strada statale 106 Jonica, the Strada statale 115 Sud Occidentale Sicula, the Strada statale 125 Orientale Sarda, the Strada statale 131 Carlo Felice, the Strada statale 131 Diramazione Centrale Nuorese, the Strada statale 148 Pontina, the Strada statale 163 Amalfitana, the Strada statale 336 dell&#x27;Aeroporto della Malpensa and the Strada statale 407 Basentana.

===India===

State highways in India are numbered highways that are laid and maintained by state governments.

===Mexico===

Mexico&#x27;s State Highway System is a system of urban and state routes constructed and maintained by each Mexican state. The main purpose of the state networks is to serve as a feeder system to the federal highway system. All states except the Federal District operate a road network. Each state marks these routes with a white shield containing the abbreviated name of the state plus the route number.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand state highways are national highways – the word &quot;state&quot; in this sense means &quot;government&quot; or &quot;public&quot; (as in state housing and state schools), not a division of a country.

New Zealand&#x27;s state highway system is a nationwide network of roads covering the North Island and the South Island. As of 2006, just under 100 roads have a &quot;State Highway&quot; designation. The NZ Transport Agency administers them. The speed limit for most state highways is 100 km/h, with reductions when one passes through a densely populated area.

The highways in New Zealand are all state highways, and the network consists of SH 1 running the length of both main islands, SH 2–5 and 10–58 in the North Island, and SH 6–8 and 60–99 in the South Island. National and provincial highways are numbered approximately north to south. State Highway 1 runs the length of both islands.

===South Korea===

Local highways () are the next important roads under the national highways. The number has two, three, or four digits. Highways with two-digit numbers are called state-funded local highways.

===Turkey===
State roads () are primary roads, mostly under the responsibility of General Directorate of Highways (KGM) except in metropolitan city centers where the responsibility lies with local government. The roads have a three-digit number designation, preceded by &quot;D&quot;.

Provincial roads () are secondary roads, maintained by respective local governments with the support of the KGM. The roads have a four-digit numbering grouped as two pairs separated by a dash. The first pair represents the license number of that province.

===United States===
State highways are generally a mixture of primary and secondary roads, although some are freeways (for example, State Route 99 in California, which links many of the cities of the Central Valley, Route 128 in Massachusetts, or parts of Route 101 in New Hampshire). Each state has its own system for numbering and its own marker. The default marker is a white circle containing a black sans-serif number (often inscribed in a black square or slightly rounded square), according to the &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (MUTCD). However each state is free to choose a different marker, and most states have. States may choose a design theme relevant to its state (such as an outline of the state itself) to distinguish state route markers from interstate, county, or municipal route markers. The longest state highway in the U.S. is Montana Highway 200.

<text>The Southwest Trail was a 19th-century pioneer route that was the primary passageway for American settlers bound for Texas.

==History==

The Southwest Trail, also known as the Old Military Road, replaced the older Natchitoches Trace, which ran from the mouth of the Missouri River, near present-day St. Louis, Missouri to present-day Fulton, Arkansas on the Red River. From Fulton, another American Indian trace followed the Red River to Natchitoches, Louisiana.

Southwest Trail was a general term for a network of trails linking St. Louis and Ste-Geneviève, Missouri to the Red River Valley of Texas. European American pioneers improved and expanded the older route. At the time of Americans&#x27; first settling the Texas territory, the Red River was the border between Mexico and the United States.

Little more than a footpath before Arkansas became a territory in 1819, Southwest Trail became a major immigration route in the 1820s. By the 1830s more than 80 percent of the Arkansas territory&#x27;s population had entered through the Southwest Trail. The U.S. Army improved the military road during Andrew Jackson’s presidency.

Usage of the trail north of the Arkansas River declined in the late 1800s, but the trail south of the river remained in use decades longer.

==Route==

From the St. Louis and Ste-Geneviève areas, the trail passed through Wayne County, Missouri. The Indian trace was the southern route of two followed by Cherokees and their enslaved Africans during the Trail of Tears.

From its origin as a footpath, to a series of rugged roads, highways follow much of the route today. Southwest Trail enters Arkansas on Arkansas Highway 166, north of Maynard, (Randolph County). It then passes through communities of Attica, Pocahontas, Imboden, Smithville, Jesup, Strawberry and Walnut Grove.

Two routes were used by pioneers en route to Southside. The older, eastern trail passes through Davidsonville, Newark and Oil Trough. Davidsonville was a pioneer key town on the Black River, but frequent flooding led to use of a newer, western route that passes through Sulphur Rock and crosses the White River at Batesville.

From Southside, the trail follows U.S. Route 167 to Pleasant Plains, then Arkansas Highway 157 to Sunnydale, then Arkansas Highway 124 to Arkansas Highway 305 to Arkansas Highway 16 to Letona Road to Mount Pisgah Road to Morris School Road to Arkansas Highway 36 to Center Hill, then Arkansas Highway 305 to Floyd, then El Paso Road to Arkansas Highway 5 through El Paso to Arkansas Highway 89, then Tate&#x27;s Mill Road to Batesville Pike Road through Gibson to Remount Road to Arkansas Highway 176 to Arkansas Highway 365 through North Little Rock.

Southwest Trail crosses the Arkansas River on U.S. Route 70, through Little Rock to Arkansas Highway 5 through Bryant and Benton to U.S. Route 70, then Arkansas Highway 229 to U.S. Route 67. At Fairplay it takes Old Military Road to Rockport, where pioneers forded the Ouachita River.

From Rockport it takes Arkansas Highway 84 to Social Hill, then Old Military Road to U.S. Route 67 at Midway, to Caddo Valley, then crosses the Caddo River on Arkansas Highway 7 to Old Military Road, to Arkansas Highway 8 then Mount Olive Road to Hollywood, then Arkansas Highway 26 to Antoine, then Arkansas Highway 29 to Arkansas Highway 19, returns to Arkansas Highway 29 through Blevins, to Arkansas Highway 32, then U.S. Route 278 to Washington. It then follows Arkansas Highway 195 to Fulton, and crosses the Red River on U.S. Route 67. It continues to Mandeville, turns off on Rondo Road to Rondo, then takes U.S. Route 82 west to the current Arkansas-Texas border of Texarkana.

The trail is commemorated in the Historic Washington State Park, northwest of Hope. Washington was a key trading point near the southwest end of the trail.

<doc id="332999" wikidata="Q717844" url="?curid=332999" title="Dan Snyder (ice hockey)">
<text>Daniel Joseph Snyder (February 23, 1978 – October 5, 2003) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He played as a centre in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Atlanta Thrashers. Following a single-vehicle accident in which he was a passenger, Snyder was injured and fell into a coma as a result. He died six days later of septic shock.

Although he played in only forty-nine NHL games, the Thrashers named an annual award after him. The Dan Snyder Memorial Award is given each year to the player who &quot;best embodies perseverance, dedication, and hard work without reward or recognition, so that his team and teammates might succeed.&quot; After the Thrashers relocated to Winnipeg the Jets continued to present the award. The American Hockey League&#x27;s (AHL) Chicago Wolves also have a yearly award given in his honor, the Dan Snyder Man of the Year Award, and have honored him by hanging a banner with other retired numbers and honored personnel. Likewise the Ontario Hockey League renamed their Humanitarian of the Year trophy in his honor as the Dan Snyder Memorial Trophy.

==Playing career==
===Junior===
In 1994 Snyder was one of the last players selected for his hometown Junior B team, the Elmira Sugar Kings. He struggled early in the season and was warned that if his poor play continued he might be replaced. Snyder&#x27;s play improved following the talk, eventually earning the Sugar Kings rookie of the year honors. The following year he tried out for the Owen Sound Platers, a Major junior team playing in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). After starting his try-out slowly, the coaching staff gave him the option to stop and pursue an NCAA scholarship. Snyder decided to continue his try-out and made the team after leading the Platers in scoring during the exhibition season. He played four years for the Platers registering 75 goals and 221 points, captaining the team in his final two seasons.

===Professional===
Undrafted, Snyder was signed by the Thrashers as a free agent in 1999. During his time in the minor leagues, he was a member of the International Hockey League champion Orlando Solar Bears in 2000–2001, and the American Hockey League champion Chicago Wolves. In 2001–2002, he was called up to the NHL, he scored 10 goals and four assists in 36 games with the Thrashers in the 2002–2003 season.

==Death and legacy==
On September 29, 2003, Snyder was critically injured after the Ferrari 360 Modena, being driven by his friend and teammate Dany Heatley, crashed. Heatley, who was driving between in a zone, lost control and skidded into a brick pillar and iron fence. Both players were ejected from the car, which was split in half by the force of the impact. Snyder required surgery to repair a depressed skull fracture and was comatose. Six days later on October 5, he lapsed into septic shock and died, never regaining consciousness. Heatley was charged with vehicular homicide as a result of the crash, a sentence that could have carried as much as 15 years in prison. He pleaded guilty to second-degree vehicular homicide, driving too fast for conditions, failure to maintain a lane, and speeding. He was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation and ordered to give 150 speeches on the dangers of speeding, and pay $25,000 to Fulton County for the cost of investigating the crash. The lighter sentence was due in part to Snyder&#x27;s parents forgiving Heatley for the accident, their desire that he not be sent to prison, and the judge&#x27;s opinion that Heatley being in prison would not benefit the community.

The following season, Atlanta dedicated the season to Snyder and Heatley, while further honoring Snyder with a patch displaying his number 37 on it and painting the same logo on the boards. Snyder was further honored with the creation of The Dan Snyder Memorial Scholarship. The scholarships were to be given to three recipients from the Elmira area. On December 31, 2003, the Thrashers played the Detroit Red Wings; during the game both teams wore the commemorative patch. Following the game the NHLPA auctioned off the game-worn jerseys with the proceeds going towards the scholarships; the resulting auction raised $56,029. The Chicago Wolves paid tribute to Snyder by renaming their community service award the Dan Snyder Man of the Year Award, while the OHL renamed their Humanitarian of the Year trophy in his honor, making it the Dan Snyder Memorial Trophy.

During the 2006–07 NHL season, Snyder&#x27;s parents, Graham and LuAnn Snyder, traveled across North America in an RV attending NHL games and speaking at engagements to raise awareness for the Dan Snyder Memorial Foundation, a foundation that provides four college scholarships a year and helps raise money for the Elmira recreation center.

Canadian band The Tragically Hip recorded a song called &quot;Heaven Is a Better Place Today&quot; in honor of Snyder. The song appears on their &quot;In Between Evolution&quot; album.

In 2003, plans for a new sports complex in Elmira were completed with a projected completion date in 2017. Snyder felt that the project needed to be completed much quicker and wanted to help make it happen sooner. After his death the Dan Snyder Memorial Foundation contributed $750,000 to the project which opened in 2009. The main arena houses the Sugar Kings and was named the Dan Snyder Memorial Arena. The Atlanta Thrashers held a practice and promotional session in the arena on October 18, 2009.

<doc id="333000" wikidata="Q7309578" url="?curid=333000" title="Regular Baptists">
<text>Regular Baptists are &quot;a moderately Calvinistic Baptist denomination that is found chiefly in the southern U.S., represents the original English Baptists before the division into Particular and General Baptists, and observes closed communion and foot washing&quot;, according to Merriam Webster. This definition describes Old Regular Baptists, not those who formed as a result of the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy.

The most prominent Regular Baptist group is the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches. While the term &quot;Regular&quot; &quot;Baptist&quot; was originally a reference to the Particular Baptists, it came to be used more loosely as a synonym for &quot;orthodox&quot;. The &quot;Baptist Bulletin&quot; of the GARBC defines them simply as groups who believe &quot;orthodox, Baptist doctrine&quot; and &quot;affirm the rule or measure of the Scripture.&quot; As compared to General Baptists or Free Baptists, Regular Baptists were strict in their beliefs, and also called Strict or Hard-shell Baptists. To be a Regular Baptist church in the GARBC is to hold to distinctive baptistic ecclesiology and interpret the Bible literally.

==History==
===United States===
The term Regular Baptists developed in America from English immigrants who had been influenced by the Particular and General Baptists churches that were established in England. According to Stuart Ivison and Fred Rosser: &quot;By 1638 there were also congregations of ‘Particular’ Baptists, who held that the Atonement was of particular application, i.e., for the sake of the elect only.&quot; The General, also known as Free Baptists, however, believed that all people could reap the benefits of atonement. This meant, particularly for the western pioneers, that individuals that were baptized were allowed to become church members and take communion.

The number of Regular Baptists began to increase over the number of General or Free Baptists after the 1707 formation of the Philadelphia Baptist Association (PBA), which in 1742 developed a Confession of Faith. The influence and mission program of the Philadelphia Baptists shifted many of the Free Baptists to Regular Baptists. John Asplund traveled the United States and created the first comprehensive list of Baptist denominations in the United States in 1790 entitled &quot;Annual Register of the Baptist Denomination in America&quot;. He found that the greatest number of Baptist churches at that time were Regular Baptist churches.

In the 1800s, the term &quot;Regular Baptist&quot; came to describe the Free Baptists. This was a surprising change as the term &quot;regular&quot; initially described the opposing position to the Free Baptists (i.e., particular atonement). This happened as a result of the strict view of communion they took which held that individuals must be baptized prior to partaking of the Lord&#x27;s Table.

Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Northern Baptist Convention was polluted by individuals who were adopting the higher-critical theories of German theologians. This caused many to separate from the convention and to form several groups of conservative, fundamental baptists. During this, the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches was born. Their designation as Regular Baptists was unrelated to the dispute over general and particular atonement.

There are still a number of organizations that are considered Regular Baptists, but the degree of strictness regarding atonement beliefs may vary across Regular Baptists churches today.

*Old Regular Baptists is a group formed in Kentucky in 1825 from the New Salem Association of United Baptists, which was formed in Kentucky in 1825. After several name changes, its name has been Old Regular since 1892. They practice foot washing and observe closed communion.
* The Sovereign Grace Association of Old Regular Baptist Churches of Jesus Christ conducts many of the practices of the Old Regular Baptists, but consider themselves more conservative.
* The General Association of Regular Baptist Churches — organized in 1932 by conservative and fundamentalist churches withdrawing from the Northern Baptist Convention (now American Baptist Churches). Today, there are more than 1,200 churches in their association. Unlike other Regular Baptist groups, they are primarily in the North, they do not practice foot washing as an ordinance, and they take no position on calvinism. They manage and operate Regular Baptist Press, the publishing arm of their association. They are headquartered in Arlington Heights, Illinois.

===Canada===
The term Regular Baptists denotes churches with strict, orthodox Baptist beliefs. In 1928, the Union of Regular Baptist Churches was formed in Hamilton, Ontario. It was succeeded in 1957 by the Association of Regular Baptist Churches of Ontario, Canada, which continues to uphold closed communion teaching and practice.

==Related organizations==

*Union Baptists — a strand of Regular Baptists that owes its origin to the Civil War. Churches and associations, especially in border states, were rent asunder by this national conflict. Tensions over secession, war and reconstruction, as well as the fact that Primitive Baptists did not allow members to hold membership in secret societies, combined to incubate the Union Baptists. Many pro-Union Primitive Baptists joined Union Leagues and were expelled from their churches and associations. The Mountain Union Association, formed in 1867, was the first &quot;Union&quot; Baptist Association. Unlike other areas, this distinction, at least in name, has persisted, and some churches and associations consider themselves &quot;Union Baptists&quot;. There seems to be no doctrinal distinction between Union Baptists and Regular Baptists. Three associations — Original Mountain Union, Primitive and Union — have about 3300 members in 36 churches. Mitchell River Union Baptist Association may still be in existence.
*Regular Baptists — found in 5 local associations; much like the Old Regular Baptists, and located in the same region, but more open to changes in worship and lifestyle. Churches have allowed notated hymnals, Sunday Schools, revivals and even instrumental music. Three associations, mostly in North Carolina, are in correspondence — Little River, Little Valley and Mountain Union (708 members in 15 churches in 1999). Two others are in isolated areas and not connected to the first three — East Washington in Arkansas (1560 members in 10 churches in 1999) and Enterprise in Ohio, Kentucky and bordering areas (4288 members in 63 churches in 1999).
*Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist Churches in Canada — although the FEBCC is not generally considered Regular Baptist, some churches of this Fellowship still carry Regular Baptist as part of their name, especially in British Columbia. Three of four major bodies forming and entering the FEBCC from 1953 to 1965 were Regular Baptist.
*Canadian Baptists of Ontario and Quebec (CBOQ) — Many Baptist churches were once Regular Baptist Churches. The CBOQ exists to equip churches and leaders to engage with their mission from God in their community.

==Notable members==
* Thomas and Nancy Lincoln, President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s parents, were members of the Licking-Locust Association of Regular Baptists in Kentucky.

<text>Infotainment (a portmanteau of &quot;information&quot; and &quot;entertainment&quot;), also called [[soft news]] as a way to distinguish it from serious journalism or hard news, is a type of media, usually television or online, that provides a combination of information and entertainment. The term may be used disparagingly to devalue infotainment or soft news subjects in favor of more serious hard news subjects. Infotainment-based websites and social media apps gained traction due to their focused publishing of infotainment content, e.g. BuzzFeed.

==Background==
The terms &quot;infotainment&quot; and &quot;infotainer&quot; were first used in September 1980 at the Joint Conference of ASLIB, the Institute of Information Scientists, and the Library Association in Sheffield, UK. The Infotainers were a group of British information scientists who put on comedy shows at these professional conferences between 1980 and 1990. In 1983, &quot;infotainment&quot; began to see more popular usage, and the infotainment style gradually began to replace soft news with communications theorists.

An earlier, slightly variant term, &quot;&quot; was the theme of the 1974 convention of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System, the association of college radio stations in the United States. The event held April 5–7, 1974, at the Statler Hilton Hotel (now the Hotel Pennsylvania), defined the term as the &quot;nexus between Information and Entertainment&quot;.

Historically, the term infotainment was used to discredit woman journalists who were assigned soft news jobs. Soft news was expected to be consumed only by women, but eventually it became its own genre of news media.

== Infotainment as news ==
Infotainment can generally be identified by its entertaining nature. Infotainment may also involve the use of flashy graphics, fast-paced editing, music, sensationalism, and sometimes satire to catch the viewer/readers&#x27; attention. Popular examples of infotainment shows include &quot;Larry King Live,&quot; &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, &quot;Hannity and Colmes&quot;, &quot;The Alex Jones Show&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, and &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;.

A precise academic consensus on the definition of what constitutes infotainment/soft news as opposed to hard news has not yet been reached. Many authors have commented that the ideas “are often not clearly defined or not defined at all”. Multiple authors have published their ideas of what each type of media involves, but they vary widely.

Wilbur Schramm was one of the first to describe a dichotomy between types of news in relation to human consumption. He separated news into a delayed reward class (including news of public affairs, economic matters, social problems, science, education and health), which closely resembles hard news, and an immediate reward class (including news of crime/corruption, accidents and disasters, sports, social events, and human interest) which closely resembles infotainment/soft news. 

Some authors use only the topicality and timeliness aspects of a story to determine whether news is hard news or soft news; the more topical and timely, the &quot;harder&quot; and more serious the news is. Other authors have more complex definitions, defining hard news as &quot;breaking events involving top leaders, major issues, or significant disruptions in the routines of daily life,&quot; and soft news as &quot;news that typically is more personality-centered, less time-bound, more practical, and more incident-based than other news.&quot;

There may also be serious reports which are not event-driven—coverage of important social, economic, legal, or technological trends— investigative reports which uncover ongoing corruption, pollution, or immorality—or discussion of unsettled political issues without any special reason. Anniversaries, holidays, the end of a year or season, or the end of the first 100 days of an administration, can make some stories time-sensitive, but these reports provide more of an opportunity for reflection and analysis as opposed to a typical news report on a particular event.

=== &quot;News you can use&quot; ===
The spectrum of &quot;seriousness&quot; and &quot;importance&quot; is not well-defined, and different media organizations make different tradeoffs. &quot;News you can use&quot;, a common marketing phrase highlighting a specific genre of journalism, spans the gray area. 

Tips, advice and hobby-based news fall at the infotainment end of this genre. Warnings about imminent natural disasters or acute domestic security threats are considered more serious, and other media programming (even non-news channels) is usually interrupted to announce these events as breaking news. The importance of &quot;news you can use&quot; on a personal level is rather subjective.

== Criticism ==
Most infotainment television programs on networks and broadcast cable only contain general information on the subjects they cover and may not be considered to have high levels of substantive informational value. For example, an infotainment broadcast may frame accusations of a celebrity or other individual committing a crime as a reality, with no verifiable factual support or evidence of such claims. Some disapprove of infotainment media, especially TV and cable, because it &quot;seem[s] to hurtle from one event to another, often dwelling on trivial, celebrity-driven content.&quot;

Today&#x27;s broadcasting of what is considered &quot;hard&quot; informative news is sometimes diluted with attributes of fiction or drama, and infotainment. Some argue that a catalyst for this may be the acquisition of major news networks by conglomerates primarily based in the entertainment business (e.g. Viacom‐Paramount owned CBS News; ABC News has been part of the Disney corporation since 1996; CNN is a key constituent of Time‐Warner, Fox News is owned by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation, one of the world&#x27;s biggest media conglomerates). The ownership structure can be traced using infotainment. For example, there may be an infotainment story on celebrities that are involved in the making of a movie produced by the news channel&#x27;s parent company.

=== Public critique ===
In October 2010 at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear, American political satirist Jon Stewart made a metaphorical statement regarding the media today: &quot;The press can hold its magnifying glass up to our problems . . . illuminating issues heretofore unseen, or they can use that magnifying glass to light ants on fire and then perhaps host a week of shows on the sudden, unexpected, dangerous flaming ant epidemic.&quot; This statement referred to the news media&#x27;s ability to focus in on the real problems of people, and transform them into infotainment that is publicized to entertain, possibly exacerbating the issue at the same time. 

In a critique of infotainment, Bonnie Anderson of &quot;News Flash&quot; cited a CNN lead story on February 2, 2004 following the exposure of Janet Jackson&#x27;s breast on national television. The follow-up story was about a ricin chemical attack on then-U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist.

== Well-known infotainers ==

Infotainers are entertainers in infotainment media, such as news anchors or satirists who cross the line between journalism (quasi-journalism) and entertainment. Barbara Walters, was for many an iconic infotainer; she pioneered many techniques still used by infotainment media today. Other notable examples from U.S. media include Oprah Winfrey, Jon Stewart, Bill O’Reilly, Rachel Maddow, Alex Jones and Geraldo Rivera.

When Geraldo Rivera became the host of his own news-oriented talk show on CNBC, others within the NBC organization voiced their protest, including Tom Brokaw, who was reported to have threatened to quit. Rivera had a notorious history as a &quot;sleaze reporter&quot; and tabloid talk show host, on which he and others would review controversial and sensationalistic topical subject matter.

==Infotainment on social media==

Infotainment is now able to reach an ever-growing audience through the widespread popularity and use of social media applications. In the case of social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook, which were originally created for the purpose of connecting, re-connecting and sharing personal thoughts and information with public, they have now provided a new medium for the spread of infotainment. 

The interactive nature of social media has also allowed for the consumers of infotainment to become producers, generating their own news and commentary, some of which is often used by journalists as material for stories.

==Impact==

The broadcast of important or interesting events was originally meant to inform society of local or international events for their own safety and awareness. However, local news broadcasters are more regularly covering local events in a way that provokes entertainment in viewers, with arresting footage, animated visuals, and rhetorical headlines that generate opinions.

The media&#x27;s ability to tell and sell stories allows them the ability to not only to document tragedy, but to misrepresent or exploit it. As is seen in the news (with stories of extreme obesity or unusual deformities) some forms of infotainment can commodify real people through their personal tragedies or scandals.

<text>The General Association of Regular Baptist Churches (GARBC), established in 1932 is an Independent Baptist Christian denomination in United States, retaining the name &quot;Regular Baptist&quot;. The association&#x27;s home office is located in Elgin, Illinois.

== History ==

The impact of modernism on the Northern Baptist Convention (now called the American Baptist Churches USA) led to the eventual withdrawal of a number of conservative and fundamentalist churches. The Baptist Bible Union (BBU) of 1923 was the forerunner to the GARBC. The final meeting of the BBU in 1932 in Chicago was the first meeting of the GARBC.

The Association publishes Regular Baptist Press, a church education curriculum and the association&#x27;s bimonthly magazine, the Baptist Bulletin.

In 2018, the GARBC had over 1,200 member churches.

According to the 2008 &quot;Yearbook of American &amp; Canadian Churches&quot;, the GARBC reported having 1,383 churches and 132,900 members in 2005. Membership is concentrated in the Midwest. The states with the highest membership rates are Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, and Ohio.

== Organization ==

The GARBC follows a &quot;&quot; model rather than a denominational model. Each member church is free to act independently in all matters. The home office of the GARBC holds no controlling power over member churches. The purpose of the association is for fellowship between churches of like faith and practice.

<text>Robert George Kardashian (February 22, 1944 – September 30, 2003) was an American attorney and businessman. He gained recognition as O. J. Simpson&#x27;s friend and defense attorney during Simpson&#x27;s 1995 murder trial. He had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian: Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob, who appear on their family reality television series, &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot;, and its spinoffs.

==Early life and education==
Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California, on February 22, 1944, one of three children born to Arthur Kardashian (1917–2012) and Helen Jean Arakelian Kardashian (1917–2008), both Armenian Americans. He had a sister, Barbara Kardashian Freeman, and a brother, Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Kardashian. The Kardashians were Armenian Spiritual Christians originally from Kars Oblast, and known by the surname Kardaschoff, a Russianized form of the Armenian surname Kardashian, as the area, though now part of modern-day Turkey, was then part of the Russian Empire. Once in the United States, Arthur&#x27;s father, Tatos, changed his name to Thomas, and began a career in garbage collection, founding his own business, and married Hamas Shakarian, also an immigrant of Armenian heritage.

He grew up in the affluent View Park area of Los Angeles County, where the family lived at 4908 Valley Ridge Avenue. Kardashian attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School and the University of Southern California, from which he graduated in 1966 with a B.S. degree in business administration. He earned a J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law and practiced for about a decade; after that, he went into business. In 1973, Kardashian was one of the co-founders of the trade publication &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;, which he and his partners sold for a large profit in 1979. Kardashian also pioneered the idea of playing music between movies in theaters. He subsequently parlayed the concept into a business, starting a company called Movie Tunes. He served as president and CEO of the firm and later invested in Juice Inc., a frozen yogurt company, and in a music video business called Concert Cinema.

== O. J. Simpson case ==
Kardashian and Simpson first met around 1967 while both of them were at USC and became close friends. Simpson was the best man at Kardashian and Kris Houghton&#x27;s wedding in 1978.

Following the June 12, 1994, murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, Simpson stayed in Kardashian&#x27;s house to avoid the media. Kardashian was the man seen carrying Simpson&#x27;s garment bag the day that Simpson flew back from Chicago. Prosecutors speculated that the bag may have contained Simpson&#x27;s bloody clothes or the murder weapon. When Simpson failed to turn himself in at 11 a.m. on June 17, 1994, Kardashian read a letter by Simpson to the assembled media. This letter was interpreted by many as a suicide note.

Simpson was charged with the murders and subsequently acquitted of all criminal charges in a controversial criminal trial. Kardashian had let his license to practice law become inactive before the Simpson case but reactivated it to aid in Simpson&#x27;s defense as a volunteer assistant on his legal team, alongside Simpson&#x27;s main defense attorneys, Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran. As one of Simpson&#x27;s lawyers and a member of the defense &quot;Dream Team&quot;, Kardashian could not be compelled or subpoenaed to testify against Simpson in the case, which included Simpson&#x27;s past history and behavior with his ex-wife Nicole, and as to the contents of Simpson&#x27;s garment bag. He sat by Simpson throughout the trial.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Kardashian said in a 1996 ABC interview with Barbara Walters that he had begun to question Simpson&#x27;s innocence: &quot;I have doubts. The blood evidence is the biggest thorn in my side; that causes me the greatest problems. So I struggle with the blood evidence.&quot; After Simpson&#x27;s acquittal, Kardashian and Simpson ultimately stopped speaking to each other.

==Illness and death==
Kardashian was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in July 2003. He died two months later, on September 30, 2003, at his home in Encino, Los Angeles, at age 59, and was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.

==In popular culture==
Kardashian was portrayed by David Schwimmer in the 2016 FX miniseries &quot;American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson&quot;. Schwimmer was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his performance, but lost to Sterling K. Brown, who portrayed Christopher Darden in the same series. In 2016, ESPN Films and their 30 for 30 series produced a five-part miniseries called &quot;O.J.: Made in America&quot;, produced by Ezra Edelman, in which Kardashian was featured heavily through archive footage.

In 2017, Kardashian was the subject of the pilot episode of the TV comedy series &quot;Over My Dead Body&quot; on Amazon Prime.

==Personal life==
Kardashian dated Priscilla Presley from 1975 to 1976. The pair met through Kardashian&#x27;s sister-in-law Joan, who had previously been married to Joe Esposito, road manager for Elvis. On an episode of &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot;, his daughter Kim stated that the two were briefly engaged.

Kardashian had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (&quot;née&quot; Houghton, later Jenner): Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob.

Shortly after separating from his first wife in 1991, Kardashian became engaged to Denice Shakarian Halicki, his third cousin and the widow of movie producer H.B. Halicki. The couple never married. In 1998, Kardashian married Jan Ashley; however, the marriage ended in annulment in 1999. Ashley later claimed frequent upset and turmoil related to Kardashian&#x27;s ex-wife, Kris, and their children &quot;were instrumental&quot; in the demise of the relationship. After dating for three years and proposing in 2001, Kardashian married his third wife, Ellen Pierson (&quot;née&quot; Markowitz), six weeks prior to his death.

<text>Basil Leonard Plumley (January 1, 1920 – October 10, 2012) was an American soldier who served in the United States Army for over three decades, rising to the rank of command sergeant major. He was a combat veteran of World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and is most noted for his actions during the Battle of Ia Drang in Vietnam.

==Early life==
Basil Leonard Plumley was born on January 1, 1920, in Blue Jay, West Virginia, one of six children born to coal miner Clay Plumley and his wife Georgia. After two years of high school, he worked as a chauffeur and truck driver before joining the U.S. Army on March 31, 1942.

==Military career==
In World War II, Plumley served with the 82nd Airborne Division, fighting in the division&#x27;s assaults of Sicily and Salerno in Italy in 1943, and the invasion of Normandy in France and Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands in 1944. He ended the war at the rank of sergeant. During the Korean War, Plumley served with the 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to the rank of sergeant major in 1961.

In the Vietnam War, Plumley served as sergeant major of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Harold G. Moore, with whom he shared a close working relationship. Moore described Plumley as a &quot;no-bullshit guy who believed, as I did, in tough training, tough discipline, and tough physical conditioning...I thank my lucky stars I had inherited such a treasure.&quot; At the Battle of Ia Drang in 1965, 450 troops of the 7th Cavalry Regiment fought some 2,000 soldiers of the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam, the first major battle of the war between U.S. and North Vietnamese forces. Plumley fought at Landing Zone X-Ray, where 79 American soldiers were killed. During the battle, Plumley grabbed a burning flare that had landed in a stack of ammunition crates near the battalion command post and threw it to safety, an action that earned him the Silver Star.

Plumley retired from the Army on December 31, 1974, at the rank of command sergeant major. After leaving the Army, Plumley worked for 15 years as an administrative assistant at Martin Army Community Hospital in Fort Benning, Georgia.

===Controversy over service record===
In 2016, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that an independent military researcher, Brian Siddall, had examined Plumley&#x27;s service records and discovered discrepancies between the awards that Plumley had worn and those he had been officially authorized to wear. For example, Plumley wore two Silver Stars and three Combat Infantryman Badges, while an official U.S. Army inquiry found that he was authorized to wear one Silver Star and one Combat Infantryman Badge. The newspaper deemed it &quot;perplexing&quot; that a &quot;proven combat leader&quot; like Plumley would wear medals he apparently did not earn. Colonel Andy Hilmes, the garrison commander at Fort Benning, acknowledged discrepancies between official Army records and the awards listed on Plumley&#x27;s headstone, prompting officials at Fort Benning to undertake an investigation. The U.S. Army Human Resources Command ultimately ruled that while &quot;there are discrepancies&quot; in Plumley&#x27;s record, &quot;there is no substantial evidence that any of CSM (R) Basil Plumley&#x27;s awards or decorations are in error.&quot; Siddall called this inaction a &quot;cover up&quot; and accused the Army of concealing fraud.

In addition to disputing Plumley&#x27;s decorations, Siddall also found discrepancies in Plumley&#x27;s service record in regard to his postings and participation in combat. Based on his research, Siddall wrote that Plumley served in the 82nd Airborne Division as a scout in a glider regiment, not as a paratrooper, contradicting the claim in Hal Moore&#x27;s book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once… and Young&quot; that Plumley made four parachute jumps in World War II. Siddall further claimed that records show Plumley was stationed at Fort Campbell and in Germany during the Korean War, in contrast to Moore&#x27;s assertion that Plumley made an additional combat jump in Korea.

==Personal life and death==
In 1949, Plumley married Deurice Dillon, with whom he had a daughter. They remained together until Deurice&#x27;s death in May 2012. Plumley died of colon cancer in Columbus, Georgia, on October 10, 2012, at the age of 92.

Plumley is a prominent figure in Lieutenant General Hal Moore&#x27;s 1992 book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once… and Young&quot;, which chronicles the Battle of Ia Drang. In the 2002 film adaptation, Plumley is portrayed by Sam Elliott.

==Awards and decorations==
Per a 2015 U.S. Army memo, Plumley was entitled to wear the following decorations:

<text>Eva Morris (née Sharpe, 8 November 1885 – 2 November 2000) was the oldest recognised person in the world, by the Guinness Book of Records, from December 1999 until November 2000. However, the Gerontology Research Group has since then validated the age of Ella Miller (1884–2000), who died on 21 November, meaning Eva Morris was in fact the world’s second-oldest living person. She was a native of Stone, Staffordshire, England.

Morris died in her sleep at 1:25 am at the Autumn House Nursing Home in Stone.

Morris attributed her longevity to whisky and boiled onions. She was said by friends to enjoy the occasional cigarette and to have ridden a bicycle.

She worked as a domestic servant and was widowed in the 1930s. Morris lived in her own flat until she was 107, when she moved to a nursing home after a chest infection. Her only child Winnie died of cancer in 1975 at the age of 62.

<doc id="333048" wikidata="Q3029344" url="?curid=333048" title="Leo Rosten">
<text>Leo Calvin Rosten (Yiddish: ; April 11, 1908 – February 19, 1997) was an American writer and humorist in the fields of scriptwriting, storywriting, journalism, and Yiddish lexicography.

==Early life==
Rosten was born into a Yiddish-speaking family in Łódź, Russian Empire (now in Poland), but immigrated to the United States with his family in 1911 when he was three. His parents were Samuel Rosten and Ida Freundlich Rosten, both trade unionists. They opened a knitting shop in the Greater Lawndale area of Chicago, where Rosten and his younger sister grew up among other working-class Jewish families.

Like their neighbors, the children spoke both English and Yiddish. Rosten showed an interest in books and language very early and began writing stories when he was only nine. During the Great Depression, when he was unable to find other work, he taught English for recent immigrants at night. These experiences eventually became the source of his most popular works, &quot;The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N&quot; and &quot;The Return of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N&quot;.

Rosten studied political science, economics, and psychology at both the University of Chicago, where he obtained his doctorate in political science, and the London School of Economics. From this time date his life-long friendships with Milton Friedman, W. Allen Wallis and other economists who would become influential in forming American neoliberalism. Unlike them, Rosten did not become a member of the Mont Pèlerin Society.

Like other University of Chicago graduates, during the war he worked in Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration, both as deputy director at the Office of War Information and as assistant to Lowell Mellett, one of Roosevelt&#x27;s aides. After the war, his connection with Allen Wallis led to his involvement with forming the Social Sciences division at the RAND Corporation. Although Rosten, who was already involved in Hollywood at this point, did not work full-time at RAND, he was an influential consultant on human psychology and put RAND in contact with several influential academics such as Hans Speier and Bernard Brodie. He also suggested that RAND contact the Ford Foundation for funding.

==Scriptwriter==
Rosten was a successful screenwriter. He wrote the story for &quot;The Dark Corner&quot; (1946), a film noir starring Mark Stevens, and &quot;Lured&quot;, the Douglas Sirk-directed period drama starring Charles Coburn; both films featured Lucille Ball. He is listed as one of the writers for &quot;Captain Newman, M.D.&quot; (1963) adapted from his novel of the same title. Other films: &quot;Mechanized Patrolling&quot; (1943; as Leonard Q. Ross), &quot;They Got Me Covered&quot; (1943) (story; as Leonard Q. Ross), &quot;All Through the Night&quot; (1942) (story; as Leonard Q. Ross), &quot;The Conspirators&quot; (1944) (screenplay), &quot;The Velvet Touch&quot; (1948), &quot;Sleep, My Love&quot; (1948) (novel) (screenplay), &quot;Double Dynamite&quot; (1954)
(story), &quot;Walk East on Beacon&quot; (1952), and &quot;Mister Cory&quot; (1957) (story).

==Stories and books==
But funny is funny. Look at Leo Rosten. He&#x27;s the Jewish James Thurber. The kind of writer who makes you laugh out loud. I made a friend of mine read &quot;The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N&quot; – she&#x27;s Boston Italian – and she agreed. But the world of that generation is disappearing. The same with Thurber. That small-town Ohio life: That world is gone. But you can still discover it in a book. That&#x27;s why people should read.
:— Fran Lebowitz

Rosten is best remembered for his stories about the night-school &quot;prodigy&quot; Hyman Kaplan, written under the pseudonym Leonard Q. Ross. They were published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; from 1935 and collected in two volumes published in 1937 and 1959, &quot;The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N&quot; and &quot;The Return of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N&quot;. &quot;The Education&quot; was a &quot;close second&quot; for one U.S. National Book Award in 1938. The second collection was one of eighteen National Book Award for Fiction finalists in 1960. (See The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N for the musical rendition.)

He is also well known for his encyclopedic &quot;The Joys of Yiddish&quot; (1968), a guide to Yiddish and to Jewish culture including anecdotes and Jewish humor. It was followed by &quot;O K*A*P*L*A*N! My K*A*P*L*A*N!&quot; (1976), a reworking of the two 1930s collections, and &quot;Hooray for Yiddish!&quot; (1982), a humorous lexicon of the American language as influenced by Jewish culture. Another Rosten work is &quot;Leo Rosten&#x27;s Treasury of Jewish Quotations&quot;.

==Quotations==
Among his own many quotations are &quot;A conservative is one who admires radicals centuries after they&#x27;re dead,&quot; &quot;Truth is stranger than fiction; fiction has to make sense,&quot; &quot;We see things as we are, not as they are,&quot; and &quot;The purpose of life is not to be happy at all. It is to be useful, to be honorable. It is to be compassionate. It is to &quot;matter,&quot; to have it make some difference that you lived.&quot; (A version of this quotation is sometimes attributed, falsely, to Ralph Waldo Emerson.)

At a tribute dinner to fellow humorist W. C. Fields, Rosten came up with the remark about Fields that &quot;any man who hates dogs and babies can&#x27;t be all bad.&quot; This statement is often misattributed to Fields himself.

In his book &quot;The Joys of Yiddish&quot;, he defines the word chutzpah as &quot;that quality enshrined in a man who, having killed his mother and father, throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan.&quot; In his novel &quot;Silky&quot;, he defines &quot;nebbish&quot; as &quot;The kind of person, when he leaves a room, you have the feeling someone fascinating just walked in.&quot;

==Personal life==
On March 30, 1935, Rosten married Priscilla Ann &quot;Pam&quot; Mead (1911–1959), a fellow graduate student at the University of Chicago and sister of anthropologist Margaret Mead. Rosten&#x27;s marriage to Mead also made him a brother-in-law of William Steig and the uncle of Jeremy Steig and Mary Catherine Bateson. They had two daughters: Madeline Rosten and Margaret Ramsey Rosten; and a son, Philip Rosten (1938–1996), and six grandchildren: Josh and Ben Lee (Madeline), Seth Muir (Margaret), and Alexander, Carrie and Pamela Rosten (Phillip). Carrie followed in her grandfather&#x27;s literary footsteps and has written three books, including a young adult novel, &quot;Chloe Leiberman (Sometimes Wong)&quot;. Leo&#x27;s and Pam&#x27;s marriage ended in divorce in 1959; she took her own life on December 1 the same year. Rosten&#x27;s second wife, whom he married January 5, 1960, was Gertrude Zimmerman (1915–1995).

Rosten died in New York City in 1997 at age 88. His obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot; on February 21, 1997, written by Chaim Bermant, describes his personality as follows:

Rosten was an inveterate Anglophile. He had enjoyed his years at LSE, was amazed by the enthusiastic reception &quot;Kaplan&quot; had received in the English press, and returned to London whenever opportunity dictated and even when it didn&#x27;t. He lived in considerable luxury in a penthouse flat in Sutton Place, one of the most exclusive areas of New York, and rented a mews flat in Mayfair. England represented the tranquillity he could not find in America. He loved to rummage in English bookshops and wear English clothes – he contrived to display a subdued elegance – to go to the London theatres and entertain and be entertained in London clubs. He himself was a member of the Savile, the Reform and the Garrick.

<text>Oskar Wilhelm Fischinger (June 22, 1900 – January 31, 1967) was a German-American abstract animator, filmmaker, and painter, notable for creating abstract musical animation many decades before the appearance of computer graphics and music videos. He created special effects for Fritz Lang&#x27;s 1929 &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot;, one of the first sci-fi rocket films, and influenced Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot;. He made over 50 short films and painted around 800 canvases, many of which are in museums, galleries, and collections worldwide. Among his film works is &quot;Motion Painting No. 1&quot; (1947), which is now listed on the National Film Registry of the U.S. Library of Congress.

==Biography==
Born in Gelnhausen, near Frankfurt, Fischinger apprenticed at an organ-building firm after he finished school until the owners were drafted into World War I. The next year he worked as a draftsman in an architect&#x27;s office, until he too was called to duty. However, since he was too &quot;unhealthy&quot;, he was rejected from combat duty. After the war, the Fischinger family moved west to Frankfurt. There Fischinger attended a trade school and worked as an apprentice, eventually obtaining an Engineer&#x27;s Diploma.

===Early career===
In Frankfurt, Fischinger met the theatre critic Bernhard Diebold, who in 1921 introduced Fischinger to the work and personage of Walter Ruttmann, a pioneer in abstract film. At this time, Fischinger was experimenting with colored liquids and three-dimensional modelling materials such as wax and clay. He invented a &quot;Wax Slicing Machine&quot;, which synchronized a vertical slicer with a movie camera&#x27;s shutter, enabling the efficient imaging of progressive cross-sections through a length of molded wax and clay. Fischinger wrote to Ruttmann about his machine, who expressed interest. Moving to Munich, Fischinger licensed the wax slicing machine to Ruttmann, who used it to make some backgrounds for Lotte Reiniger&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Prince Achmed&quot;, an animated fairy tale film, making the moving backgrounds and magic scenes. During this time Fischinger shot many abstract tests of his own using the machine. Some of these are distributed today under the assigned title &quot;Wax Experiments&quot;.

In 1924, Fischinger formed a company with American entrepreneur Louis Seel to produce satirical cartoons that tended toward mature audiences. One survives in his film estate, &quot;Pierrette I&quot;. He also continued to make abstract films and tests of his own, trying new and different techniques, including multiple projector performances. &quot;In 1926 and 1927, Fischinger performed his own multiple projector film shows with various musical accompaniments. These shows were titled &quot;Fieber&quot; (&quot;Fever&quot;), &quot;Vakuum&quot;, and &quot;Macht&quot; (&quot;Power&quot;)&#x27;&quot;.

Facing financial difficulties, Fischinger borrowed from his family, and then his landlady. Finally, in an effort to escape bill collectors, Fischinger decided to surreptitiously depart Munich for Berlin in June 1927. Taking only his essential equipment, he walked 350 miles through the countryside, shooting single frames that were released many decades later as the film &quot;Walking from Munich to Berlin&quot;.

===Berlin===
Arriving in Berlin, Fischinger borrowed some money from a relative and set up a studio on Friedrichstraße. He soon was creating special effects for various films. His own proposals for cartoons were not accepted by producers or distributors, however. In 1928, he was hired to work on the feature film &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot; (German: Frau im Mond), directed by Fritz Lang, which provided him a steady salary for a time. On his own time, he experimented with charcoal-on-paper animation. He produced a series of abstract &quot;Studies&quot; that were synchronized to popular and classical music. A few of the early Studies were synchronized to new record releases by Electrola, and screened at first-run theatres with a tail credit advertising the record, thus making them, in a sense, the very first music videos.

The Studies — Numbers 1 through 12 — were well received and many were distributed to first-run theatres worldwide, as far as Japan and South America. His &quot;Studie Nr. 5&quot; screened at the 1931 &quot;Congress for Colour-Music Research&quot; to critical acclaim. In 1932, Universal Pictures purchased distribution rights to one of the Studies for the American public. The special effects Fischinger did for clients&#x27; films and commercials led to his being called &quot;the Wizard of Friedrichstraße&quot;. In 1932, Fischinger married Elfriede Fischinger, a first cousin from his hometown of Gelnhausen.

As the Nazis consolidated power after 1933, the abstract film and art communities and distribution possibilities quickly disappeared as the Nazis instituted their policies against what they termed &quot;degenerate art&quot;. His brother Hans Fischinger showed his absolute film &quot;Tanz der Farben&quot; (i.e. &quot;The Dance of Colors&quot;) in Hamburg in 1939. Oskar Fischinger continued to make films, and commercials and advertisements, among them &quot;Muratti greift ein&quot; (translated as &quot;Muratti Gets in the Act&quot;, or &quot;Muratti Marches On&quot;) (1934), for a cigarette company, and &quot;Kreise&quot; (&quot;Circles&quot;) (1933–34), for the Tolirag advertising agency. The color &quot;Muratti&quot; commercial with its stop-motion dancing cigarettes screened all over the world. Fischinger managed to complete his abstract work &quot;Komposition in Blau&quot; in 1935. It was well-received critically, and contrary to popular myth, was legally registered. An agent from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer screened prints of &quot;Komposition in Blau&quot; and &quot;Muratti&quot; in a small art theatre in Hollywood, and Ernst Lubitsch was impressed by the films and the audience&#x27;s enthusiastic response to the shorts. An agent from Paramount Pictures telephoned Fischinger, asking if he was willing to work in the United States, and Fischinger promptly agreed.

===Hollywood===
Upon arriving in Hollywood in February 1936, Fischinger was given an office at Paramount Studios, German-speaking secretaries, an English tutor, and a weekly salary of $250.($4400 in 2017 dollars, adjusted for inflation). He and Elfriede socialized with the émigré community. As he waited for his assignment to begin, Fischinger sketched and painted. He prepared a film which was originally named &quot;Radio Dynamics&quot;, but known today as Allegretto, tightly synchronized to Ralph Rainger&#x27;s tune &quot;Radio Dynamics&quot;. This short film was planned for inclusion in the feature film &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1937&quot; (1936). However, Paramount only planned to release in black-and-white film, which was not communicated to Fischinger when he began his work. Paramount would not allow even a test in color of Fischinger&#x27;s film. Fischinger requested to be let out of his contract and left Paramount. Several years later, with the help of Hilla von Rebay and a grant from the Museum of Non-Objective Painting (later The Guggenheim), he was able to buy the film back from Paramount. Fischinger then redid and re-painted the cels and made a color version to his satisfaction which he then called &quot;Allegretto&quot;. According to biographer William Moritz, this became one of the most-screened and successful films of visual music&#x27;s history, and one of Fischinger&#x27;s most popular films.

Most of Fischinger&#x27;s filmmaking attempts in America suffered difficulties. According to Moritz, Fischinger composed &quot;An Optical Poem&quot; (1937) to Franz Liszt&#x27;s Second &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody&quot; for MGM, but received no profits due to studio bookkeeping systems. He designed the J. S. Bach &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D Minor&quot; sequence for Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940), but quit without credit because Disney altered his designs to be more representational. According to William Moritz, Fischinger contributed to the effects animation of the Blue Fairy&#x27;s wand in &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940). In the 1950s, Fischinger created several animated TV advertisements, including one for Muntz TV.

The Museum of Non-Objective Painting commissioned him to synchronize a film with a march by John Philip Sousa in order to demonstrate loyalty to America, and then insisted that he make a film to Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concerto&quot; No. 3, even though he wanted to make a film without sound in order to affirm the integrity of his non-objective imagery. Secretly, Fischinger composed the silent film &quot;Radio Dynamics&quot; (1942).

Frustrated in his filmmaking, Fischinger turned increasingly to oil painting as a creative outlet. According to Moritz, though the Guggenheim Foundation specifically requested a cel animation film, Fischinger made his Bach film &quot;Motion Painting No. 1&quot; (1947) as a documentation of the act of painting, taking a single frame each time he made a brush stroke—and the multi-layered style merely parallels the structure of the Bach music without any tight synchronization. Although he never again received funding for any of his personal films (only some commercial work), the &quot;Motion Painting No. 1&quot; won the Grand Prix at the Brussels International Experimental Film Competition in 1949. Three of Fischinger&#x27;s films also made the 1984 Olympiad of Animation&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s greatest films. On January 31, 1967, he died at the age of 66.

The Academy Film Archive has preserved many of Oskar Fischinger&#x27;s films, including &quot;Motion Painting No. 1&quot;, &quot;Squares&quot;, and &quot;Spirals&quot;.

==Lumigraph==
In the late 1940s Fischinger invented the &quot;Lumigraph&quot; (patented in 1955) which some have mistakenly called a type of color organ. Fischinger had hoped to make the Lumigraph a commercial product, widely available for anyone, but this did not happen. The instrument produced imagery by pressing against a rubberized screen so it could protrude into a narrow beam of colored light. As a visual instrument, the size of its screen was limited by the reach of the performer. Two people were required to operate the Lumigraph: one to manipulate the screen to create imagery, and a second to change the colors of the lights on cue.

The device itself was silent, but was performed accompanying various music. Fischinger gave several performances in Los Angeles and one in San Francisco in the early 1950s, performing various classical and popular music pieces, and many were impressed by the machine&#x27;s spectacular images. In 1964 the Lumigraph was used in the science fiction film &quot;The Time Travelers&quot;, in which it became a &quot;lumichord&quot;, although this was not Fischinger&#x27;s intent, but the decision of the film&#x27;s producers. Fischinger&#x27;s son Conrad even built two more machines in different sizes. After his death, his widow Elfriede and daughter Barbara gave performances with the Lumigraph, along with William Moritz, in Europe and the US.

Today one of the instruments is in the collection of the Deutsches Filmmuseum in Frankfurt, and the other two are in California. In February 2007 Barbara Fischinger performed on the original Lumigraph in Frankfurt, and in 2012 in Amsterdam.

<text>David J. Bradley (born 4 January 1949) is one of the twelve engineers who worked on the original IBM PC, developing the computer&#x27;s ROM BIOS code. Bradley is credited for implementing the &quot;Control-Alt-Delete&quot; (Ctrl-Alt-Del) key combination that was used to reboot the computer. Bradley joined IBM in 1975 after earning his doctorate in electrical engineering from Purdue University with a dissertation on computer architectures.  

==Education==
Bachelors, Electrical Engineering, University of Dayton (Ohio), 1971.
Master of Science, Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, 1972.
PhD, Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, 1975.

==Control-Alt-Delete==
According to Bradley, Control-Alt-Delete was not intended to be used by end users, originally—it was meant to be used by people writing programs or documentation, so that they could reboot their computers without powering them down. This was useful since after a computer was powered down, it was necessary to wait a few seconds before powering it up again to avoid potential damage to the power supply and hard drive. Since software developers and technical writers would need to restart a computer many times, this key combination was a big time-saver. David Bradley and Mel Hallerman chose this key combination because it is practically impossible to accidentally press this combination of keys on a standard original IBM PC keyboard.

However, the key combination was described in IBM&#x27;s technical reference documentation and thereby revealed to the general public.

At the 20th anniversary of the IBM PC on August 8, 2001 at The Tech Museum, while on a panel with Bill Gates, Bradley said, &quot;I have to share the credit. I may have invented it [Control-Alt-Delete], but I think Bill made it famous.&quot;

Multiple-key reboot had been introduced by Exidy, Inc., in 1978, for its Sorcerer Z80 computer. It provided two Reset buttons, which must be pressed simultaneously to achieve reboot.

In March 1980, the multiple-key reboot concept had been introduced for the Apple II by Videx in its VideoTerm display card add-on, requiring Control-Reset, rather than Reset alone, to reboot the machine. The innovation was noted and well received at the time.

==Other accomplishments==
Bradley is the author of &quot;Assembly Language Programming for the IBM Personal Computer&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster, , January 1984), also released in French as &quot;Assembleur sur IBM PC&quot; (Dunod, ), Russian (&quot;Radio&quot; Publishing House, Moscow), and Bulgarian (&quot;Technica&quot; Publishing house, 1989).

Bradley holds seven U.S. patents.

Bradley has been adjunct professor of electrical and computer engineering at Florida Atlantic University and at North Carolina State University.

Much of Bradley&#x27;s career has been at IBM. Bradley received a B.E.E. degree in 1971 from the University of Dayton, (Ohio). He went on to Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, where he completed an M.S. degree in 1972 and Ph.D. in 1975, both in electrical engineering. Upon graduation he went to work for IBM in Boca Raton, Florida, as senior associate engineer. He worked on the Series/1 system. In 1978 he developed the I/O system for the System/23 Datamaster.

In 1980, Bradley was one of twelve engineers developing the first IBM Personal Computer. Bradley developed the ROM BIOS. That got him promoted to manage the BIOS and diagnostics for the IBM PC/XT. In 1983 Bradley formed the Personal Systems Architecture Department. In 1984, he helped manage development of the Personal System/2 Model 30.

In November 1987, Bradley became manager of advanced processor design. His group developed the 486/25 Power Platform and the PS/2 Models 90 and 95. In 1991, he became manager of systems architecture for the Entry Systems Technology group. In 1992 he became the architecture manager for the group that developed a personal computer using the PowerPC RISC microprocessor.

In 1993, he returned to be the manager of architecture in the PC group.

On January 30, 2004, Bradley retired from IBM.

Bradley wrote about the development of the IBM PC, including Control-Alt-Delete, in the August 2011 issue of the IEEE&#x27;s &quot;Computer&quot; magazine.

<text>Doubleday is an American publishing company. It was founded as the Doubleday &amp; McClure Company in 1897. By 1947, it was the largest book publisher in the United States. It published the work of mostly U.S. authors under a number of imprints and distributed them through its own stores. 

In 2009, Doubleday merged with Knopf Publishing Group to form the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, which, as of 2018, is part of Penguin Random House.

==History==
===19th century===
The firm was founded as Doubleday &amp; McClure Company in 1897 by Frank Nelson Doubleday in partnership with Samuel Sidney McClure. McClure had founded the first U.S. newspaper syndicate in 1884 (McClure Syndicate) and the monthly &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1893. One of their first bestsellers was &quot;The Day&#x27;s Work&quot; by Rudyard Kipling, a short story collection that Macmillan published in Britain late in 1898. Other authors published by the company in its early years include W. Somerset Maugham and Joseph Conrad. Theodore Roosevelt Jr. later served as a vice-president of the company.

===20th century===
The partnership ended in 1900. McClure and John Sanborn Phillips, the co-founder of his magazine, formed McClure, Phillips and Company. Doubleday and Walter Hines Page formed Doubleday, Page &amp; Company.

The bestselling novels of Thomas Dixon Jr., including &quot;The Leopard&#x27;s Spots&quot;, 1902 and &quot;The Clansman&quot;, 1905, &quot;changed a struggling publishing venture into the empire that Doubleday was to become&quot;. At the same time, Doubleday helped Dixon launch his writing career. Page and Dixon were both from North Carolina and had known each other in Raleigh, North Carolina.

In 1910, Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. moved its operations, which included a train station, to Garden City, New York, on Long Island. The company purchased much of the land on the east side of Franklin Avenue, and estate homes were built for many of its executives on Fourth Street. Co-founder and Garden City resident Walter Hines Page was named Ambassador to Great Britain in 1916. In 1922, the company founded its juvenile department, the second in the nation, with May Massee as head. The founder&#x27;s son Nelson Doubleday joined the firm in the same year.

In 1927, Doubleday, Page merged with the George H. Doran Company, creating Doubleday, Doran, then the largest publishing business in the English-speaking world. Doubleday Canada Limited launches in the thirties. In 1944, Doubleday, Doran acquired the Philadelphia medical publisher Blakiston. 

In 1946, the company became Doubleday and Company. Nelson Doubleday resigned as president, but continued as chairman of the board until his death on January 11, 1949. Douglas Black took over as president from 1946 to 1963. His tenure attracted numerous public figures to the publishing company, including Dwight D. Eisenhower, Harry S. Truman, Douglas MacArthur, Robert Taft, and André Malraux. He was a strong opponent of censorship and felt that it was his responsibility to the American public to publish controversial titles. Black also expanded Doubleday&#x27;s publishing program by opening two new printing plants; creating a new line of quality paperbacks, under the imprint Anchor Books; founding mail-order subscription book clubs in its book club division; opening 30 new retail stores in 25 cities; and opening new editorial offices in San Francisco, London, and Paris.

By 1947, Doubleday was the largest publisher in the United States, with annual sales of more than 30 million books. In 1954, Doubleday sold Blakiston to McGraw-Hill.

Doubleday&#x27;s son-in-law John Sargent was president and CEO from 1963 to 1978. In 1964, Doubleday acquired the educational publisher Laidlaw.

In 1967, the company purchased the Dallas-based Trigg-Vaughn group of radio and TV stations to create Doubleday Broadcasting. After expanding during the 1970s and 1980s, Doubleday sold the broadcasting division in 1986.

Nelson Doubleday Jr. succeeded John Sargent as president and CEO from 1978 to 1985. 

In 1976, Doubleday bought paperback publisher Dell Publishing. In 1980, the company bought the New York Mets baseball team. The Mets defeated the Boston Red Sox to win the World Series in in a seven-game contest. In 1981, Doubleday promoted James R. McLaughlin to the presidency of Dell Publishing.

Sales slowed in the early 1980s and earnings fell precipitously. Doubleday Jr., brought James McLaughlin over (from subsidiary Dell) to help streamline and downsize. McLaughlin went on to succeed Doubleday Jr., as president and CEO, with Doubleday Jr., becoming chairman of the board.

By 1986, the firm was a fully integrated international communications company, doing trade publishing, mass-market paperback publishing, book clubs, and book manufacturing, together with ventures in broadcasting and advertising. The company had offices in London and Paris and wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, with joint ventures in the UK and the Netherlands. Nelson Doubleday Jr. sold the publishing company to Bertelsmann in 1986 for a reported $475 million, with James R. McLaughlin resigning on December 17, 1986. After the purchase, Bertelsmann sold Laidlaw to Macmillan Inc.

The sale of Doubleday to Bertelsmann did not include the Mets, which Nelson Doubleday and minority owner Fred Wilpon had purchased from Doubleday &amp; Company for $85 million. In 2002, Doubleday sold his stake in the Mets to Wilpon for $135 million after a feud over the monetary value of the team. 

In 1988, portions of the firm became part of the Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, which in turn became a division of Random House in 1998. Doubleday was combined in a group with Broadway Books, Anchor Books was combined with Vintage Books as a division of Knopf, while Bantam and Dell became a separate group.

In 1996, Doubleday founded the Christian publisher WaterBrook Press.

===21st century===
WaterBrook acquired Harold Shaw Publishers in 2000 and Multnomah Publishers in 2006.

In late 2008 and early 2009, Doubleday imprint merged with Knopf Publishing Group to form the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. In October 2008, Doubleday laid off about 10% of its staff (16 people) across all departments. That December, the Broadway, Doubleday Business, Doubleday Religion, and WaterBrook Multnomah divisions were moved to Crown Publishing Group, a subsidiary of Random House in Manhattan.

<doc id="333059" wikidata="Q1199173" url="?curid=333059" title="Albanian cuisine">
<text>Albanian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the Mediterranean. It is also an example of the Mediterranean diet based on the importance of olive oil, fruits, vegetables, and fish. The cooking traditions of the Albanian people are diverse in consequence of the environmental factors that are more importantly suitable for the cultivation of nearly every kind of herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Olive oil is the most ancient and commonly used vegetable fat in Albanian cooking, produced since antiquity throughout the country particularly along the coasts.

Hospitality is a fundamental custom of Albanian society and serving food is integral to the hosting of guests and visitors. It is not infrequent for visitors to be invited to eat and drink with locals. The medieval Albanian code of honor, called &quot;besa&quot;, resulted to look after guests and strangers as an act of recognition and gratitude.

Albanian cuisine can be divided into three major regional cuisines. The cuisine of the northern region has a rural, coastal and mountainous origin. Meat, fish and vegetables are central to the cuisine of the northern region. The people there use many kinds of ingredients that usually grow in the region, including potatoes, carrots, maize, beans, and cabbage, and also cherries, walnuts and almonds. Garlic and onions are as well important components to the local cuisine and added to almost every dish.

The cuisine of the central region is threefold of rural, mountainous and coastal. The central region is the flattest and rich in vegetation and biodiversity as well as culinary specialties. It has Mediterranean characteristics due to its proximity to the sea, which is rich in fish. Dishes here include several meat specialties and desserts of all kinds.

In the south, the cuisine is composed of two components: the rural products of the field including dairy products, citrus fruits and olive oil, and coastal products, i.e. seafood. Those regions are particularly conducive to raising animals, as pastures and feed resources are abundant.

Besides garlic, onions are arguably the country&#x27;s most widely used ingredient. Albania is ranked fifth in the world in terms of onion consumption per capita.

== History ==

Albanian cuisine is deeply rooted in the country&#x27;s history, geography, and culture, reflecting its rich tapestry of influences and traditions. It draws inspiration from the Mediterranean, Ottoman, and Balkan culinary traditions, while showcasing unique local flavors and techniques. Here&#x27;s an overview of its history:

Ancient Roots

Albania’s culinary heritage can be traced back to ancient Illyrian times, when the diet primarily consisted of grains, legumes, wild herbs, and dairy products. The fertile lands of Albania and its mild climate allowed for the cultivation of olives, grapes, and wheat, which became staples in the diet.

Byzantine and Ottoman Influence

The Byzantine Empire introduced dishes with strong Mediterranean characteristics, including the use of olive oil, seafood, and a variety of herbs. With the Ottoman conquest in the 15th century, Albanian cuisine absorbed Turkish elements. Dishes like byrek (savory pie), baklava, and kebabs became staples. The use of spices like cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, as well as rice-based dishes like pilaf, became prominent during this period.

== Characteristics and meals ==

The location of Albania in the western Balkan Peninsula and on the Mediterranean Sea has a large influence on Albanian cuisine. Many foods that are common in the Mediterranean Basin, such as olives, wheat, chickpeas, dairy products, fish, fruits, and vegetables, are prominent in the Albanian cooking tradition. Albania has a distinctly Mediterranean climate. Across the country, a range of microclimates due to differing soil types and topography allows a variety of products to be grown. Citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, figs and olives thrive.


Every region has its own typical breakfast. Breakfast is generally light. Bread is common, served with butter, cheese, jam and yogurt, and accompanied with olives, coffee, milk, tea or raki. Trahaná (tarhana) is also a common breakfast in many rural areas. It is common to have only fruit or a slice of bread and a cup of coffee or tea for breakfast. Coffee and tea are enjoyed both in homes and in cafés.

Lunch is traditionally the biggest meal of the day, for everyone from school children to shop workers and government officials. In the past, people went home to have lunch with their families, but it is now common to have lunch with friends at restaurants or cafeterias. Lunch sometimes consists of &quot;gjellë&quot;, a main dish of slowly cooked meat with various vegetables, accompanied by a salad of fresh vegetables, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers, onions and olives. Salads are typically served with meat dishes and are dressed with salt, olive oil, white vinegar or lemon juice. Grilled or fried vegetables and sausages and various forms of omelettes are also eaten. Common beverages are coffee, tea, fruit juices and milk.

Supper in Albania is a smaller meal, often consisting only of a variety of breads, meat, fresh fish or seafood, cheese, eggs and various kind of vegetables, similar to breakfast, or possibly sandwiches.
== Ingredients ==
Located in Southern Europe with a direct proximity to the Mediterranean Sea, the Albanian cuisine features a wide range of fresh fruits, growing naturally in the fertile Albanian soil and under the warm sun. In consideration of being an agricultural country, Albania is a significant fruit importer and exporter. Besides citrus fruits, cherries, strawberries, blueberries and raspberries are among the most cultivated fruits. Many Albanians keep fruit trees in their yards. Fresh and dried fruits are eaten as snacks and desserts.

Fruits that are traditionally associated with Albanian cuisine include apple, grape, olive, orange, nectarine, blackberry, cherry, persimmon, pomegranate, figs, watermelon, avocado, lemon, peach, plum, strawberries, raspberry, mulberry and cornelian cherry.

A wide variety of vegetables are frequently used in Albanian cooking. Due to the different climate and soil conditions across Albania, cultivars of cabbages, turnips, beetroots, beans, potatoes, leeks and mushrooms can be found in a rich variety. Dried or pickled vegetables are also processed, especially in drier or colder regions such as in the remote Albanian Alps, where fresh vegetables were hard to get out of season. Particularly used vegetables include onion, garlic, tomato, cucumber, carrot, pepper, spinach, lettuce, grape leaves, bean, eggplant and zucchini.

Herbs are very popular. A wide variety are readily available at supermarkets or local produce stands across the country. The proximity to the Mediterranean Sea and the ideal climatic conditions allows the cultivation of about 250 aromatic and medical plants. Albania is among the leading producers and exporter of herbs in the world. Further, the country is a worldwide significant producer of oregano, thyme, sage, salvia, rosemary and yellow gentian. Most commonly used herbs and other seasonings in Albanian cooking include artichoke, basil, chili pepper, cinnamon, coriander, lavender, oregano, peppermint, rosemary, thyme, bay, vanilla, saffron.
== Drinks ==


Tea is a widely consumed beverage throughout Albania and particularly served at cafés, restaurants or at home. The country is rich in the cultivation of a wide range of herbs. The most popular varieties of tea drinking in Albania include Albanian-style mountain tea, which grows in the Albanian mountains and villages, and Russian- and Turkish-style black tea with sugar to tea with lemon, milk or honey.

Coffee is another popular beverage in Albania, but more particularly in the cities and villages. There are various varieties of coffee popular in Albania, such as espresso, cappuccino, macchiato, mocha and latte. As Albania was formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, coffee in the Turkish style is also common. Filter coffee and instant coffee are also available. Cafés are found everywhere in urban areas and function as meeting places for socializing and conducting business. Almost all serve baked goods and sandwiches and many also serve light meals. Tirana is particularly well known for its café culture.

In 2016, Albania surpassed Spain by becoming the country with the most coffee houses per capita in the world. In fact, there are 654 coffee houses per 100,000 inhabitants in Albania, a country with only 2.5 million inhabitants.

Dhallë is a traditional and healthy yogurt-based drink in Albania made by blending yogurt with water or milk and spices. It is especially popular during the summer month and it may be served with salt, according to taste.

Boza is a malt drink made from maize (corn) and wheat which is widely consumed with desserts in Albania.

Raki is the most popular spirit in Albania. It is considered as the national spirit beverage of the country. The most common types of raki in the country are grape, plum or blackberry. It is commonly served to the older people and is heated and sweetened with honey or sugar, with added spices. Although in the south of the country, &quot;Raki rigoni&quot; is very popular among the people and is made of white oregano, that is cultivated in the region.

Albania is a traditionally wine drinking country. The people of Albania drink wine in moderation and almost always at meals or social occasions. Albanians drink about 5.83 liters of wine per person per year, which has been increasing since the Albanian production of high-quality wine grows to meet demand. The origins of wine production in Albania can be traced back to 6,000 years and evidence suggesting wine production confirm that Albania is among the earliest wine producers in Europe.
== Pastries and desserts ==

There is a strong tradition of home baking in the country and pâtisseries are present in every city and village across the country. Entirely Albanian desserts and pastries consist primarily of fruits including oranges and lemons that grow as well as in the country. Traditionally, fresh fruits are often eaten after a meal as a dessert. Those dishes are inspired from both Western and Eastern civilizations.

Kanojët is a typical Sicilian pastry and very common among the Arbëreshë people, which brought that dish back into their homelands, Albania where it is popular. It is made of tube-shaped shells of fried pastry dough, filled with a sweet, creamy filling usually containing ricotta. The kanojët from Piana degli Albanesi, an Arbëreshë village, are often referred to be the best cannolo.

Baklava is made frequently in Albania, especially around certain religious holidays of Muslims, Catholics and Orthodox. It is prepared on large trays and cut into a variety of shapes. Baklava is either with hazelnuts or walnuts sweetened with syrup.

Petulla is a traditional fried dough made from wheat or buckwheat flour, which is as well a popular dish among the Albanians and served with powdered sugar or feta cheese and raspberry jam.

Pandispanjë is a traditional base for several Albanian desserts and cakes based on flour, sugar, butter and eggs. A variety of fillings are used, such as jelly, chocolate, fruit and pastry cream.

Ballokume is an Albanian cookie, which originated in Elbasan during the Middle Ages and prepared every year on Summer Day, a public holiday in the country. It has to be brewed in large copper pots, tightly whipped with a wooden spoon and baked in a wood oven.

Fruit jam, also known as reçel, is enjoyed all year in Albania and a major component of the Albanian cooking tradition. The fruit preserve is made by cooking the juice of the fruit or the fruit itself, which usually grow in Albania, with sugar. It is served to many dishes as a side dish.

Zupa is a popular dessert and assembled by alternating layers of cookies or sponge cake with pastry cream.

<text>The family Cyrtaucheniidae, known as wafer-lid trapdoor spiders, are a widespread family of Mygalomorphae spiders. 
==Description==
Wafer-lid spiders are generally large and range in color between light brown and black. Their eyes are placed in two rows, either in a rectangular position or with the back row wider apart. They lack the thornlike spines on tarsi and metatarsi I and II (the two outermost leg segments) found in true trapdoor spiders (Ctenizidae).

Many, but not all, make wafer-like doors to their burrows, while others build the cork-like doors found commonly in the true trapdoor spiders.

==Distribution==
The family is well represented South America, and Africa. A currently undescribed genus in the western United States may hold an altitude record for the family, being found up to over . The genus &quot;Anemesia&quot; is found only in Central Asia, and &quot;Cyrtauchenius&quot; reaches from Algeria north to Italy, with one species found in the USA. &quot;Angka&quot; is endemic to the cloud forest of Doi Inthanon, Thailand.

==Genera==

The former subfamily Euctenizinae from the US and Mexico were promoted to family rank as Euctenizidae in 2012, and are now considered more closely related to Idiopidae. Further changes to the circumscription of the family were made in 2020. , the World Spider Catalog accepted the following genera:

*&quot;Acontius&quot; — Africa, Argentina
*&quot;Ancylotrypa&quot; — Africa
*&quot;Anemesia&quot; — Asia
*&quot;Bolostromoides&quot; — Venezuela
*&quot;Bolostromus&quot; — South America, Caribbean, Panama, Uganda
*&quot;Cyrtauchenius&quot; — Algeria, United States
Genera which have been reclassified to other families include:
*&quot;Amblyocarenum&quot; → Nemesiidae
*&quot;Angka&quot; → Microstigmatidae
*&quot;Homostola&quot; → Bemmeridae
*&quot;Fufius &quot; → Rhytidicolidae

<text>Piano acoustics is the set of physical properties of the piano that affect its sound. It is an area of study within musical acoustics.

==String length, mass and tension==
The strings of a piano vary in diameter, and therefore in mass per length, with lower strings thicker than upper. A typical range is from for the lowest bass strings to , string size 13, for the highest treble strings. These differences in string thickness follow from well-understood acoustic properties of strings.

Given two strings, equally taut and heavy, one twice as long as the other, the longer will vibrate with a pitch one octave lower than the shorter. However, if one were to use this principle to design a piano, i.e. if one began with the highest notes and then doubled the length of the strings again and again for each lower octave, it would be impossible to fit the bass strings onto a frame of any reasonable size. Furthermore, when strings vibrate, the width of the vibrations is related to the string length; in such a hypothetical ultra-long piano, the lowest strings would strike one another when played. Instead, piano makers take advantage of the fact that a heavy string vibrates more slowly than a light string of identical length and tension; thus, the bass strings on the piano are shorter than the &quot;double with each octave&quot; rule would predict, and are much thicker than the others.

The other factor that affects pitch, other than length, density and mass, is tension. Individual string tension in a concert grand piano may average , and have a cumulative tension exceeding each.

==Inharmonicity and piano size==

Any vibrating thing produces vibrations at a number of frequencies above the fundamental pitch. These are called overtones. When the overtones are integer multiples (e.g., 2×, 3× ... 6× ... ) of the fundamental frequency (called harmonics), then — neglecting damping — the oscillation is periodic, i.e. it vibrates exactly the same way over and over. Many enjoy the sound of periodic oscillations; for this reason, many musical instruments, including pianos, are designed to produce nearly periodic oscillations, that is, to have overtones as close as possible to the harmonics of the fundamental tone.

In an ideal vibrating string, when the wavelength of a wave on a stretched string is much greater than the thickness of the string (the theoretical ideal being a string of zero thickness and zero resistance to bending), the wave velocity on the string is constant and the overtones are at the harmonics. That is why so many instruments are constructed of skinny strings or thin columns of air.

However, for high overtones with short wavelengths that approach the diameter of the string, the string behaves more like a thick metal bar: its mechanical resistance to bending becomes an additional force to the tension, which &#x27;raises the pitch&#x27; of the overtones. Only when the bending force is much smaller than the tension of the string, are its wave-speed (and the overtones pitched as harmonics) unchanged. The frequency-raised overtones (above the harmonics), called &#x27;partials&#x27;, can produce an unpleasant effect called &quot;inharmonicity&quot;. Basic strategies to reduce inharmonicity include decreasing the thickness of the string or increasing its length, choosing a flexible material with a low bending force, and increasing the tension force so that it stays much bigger than the bending force.

Winding a string allows an effective decrease in the thickness of the string. In a wound string, only the inner core resists bending while the windings function only to increase the linear density of the string. The thickness of the inner core is limited by its strength and by its tension; stronger materials allow for thinner cores at higher tensions, reducing inharmonicity. Hence, piano designers choose high-quality steel for their strings, as its strength and durability help them minimize string diameters.

If string diameter, tension, mass, uniformity, and length compromises were the only factors—all pianos could be small, spinet-sized instruments. Piano builders, however, have found that longer strings increase instrument power, harmonicity, and reverberation, and help produce a properly tempered tuning scale.

With longer strings, larger pianos achieve the longer wavelengths and tonal characteristics desired. Piano designers strive to fit the longest strings possible within the case; moreover, all else being equal, the sensible piano buyer tries to obtain the largest instrument compatible with budget and space.

Inharmonicity increases continuously as notes get further from the middle of the piano, and is one of the practical limits on the total range of the instrument. The lowest strings, which are necessarily the longest, are most limited by the size of the piano. The designer of a short piano is forced to use thick strings to increase mass density and is thus driven into accepting greater inharmonicity.

The highest strings must be under the greatest tension, yet must also be thin enough to allow for a low mass density. The limited strength of steel (i.e. a too-thin string will break under the tension) forces the piano designer to use very short and slightly thicker strings, whose short wavelengths thus generate inharmonicity.

The natural inharmonicity of a piano is used by the tuner to make slight adjustments in the tuning of a piano. The tuner stretches the notes, slightly sharpening the high notes and flatting the low notes to make overtones of lower notes have the same frequency as the fundamentals of higher notes.

:&quot;See also Piano wire, piano tuning, psychoacoustics&quot;.

==The Railsback curve==
The Railsback curve, first measured in the 1930s by O.L. Railsback, a US college physics teacher, expresses the difference between inharmonicity-aware stretched piano tuning, and theoretically correct equal-tempered tuning in which the frequencies of successive notes are related by a constant ratio, equal to the twelfth root of two. For any given note on the piano, the deviation between the actual pitch of that note and its theoretical equal-tempered pitch is given in cents (hundredths of a semitone). The curve is derived empirically from actual pianos tuned to be pleasing to the ear, not from an exact mathematical equation.

As the Railsback curve shows, octaves are normally stretched on a well-tuned piano. That is, the high notes are tuned higher, and the low notes tuned lower, than they are in a mathematically idealized equal-tempered scale. Railsback discovered that pianos were typically tuned in this manner not because of a lack of precision, but because of inharmonicity in the strings. For a string vibrating like an ideal harmonic oscillator, the overtone series of a single played note includes many additional, higher frequencies, each of which is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. But in fact, inharmonicity caused by piano strings being slightly inflexible makes the overtones actually produced successively higher than they would be if the string were perfectly harmonic.

===Shape of the curve===
Inharmonicity in a string is caused primarily by stiffness. That stiffness is the result of piano wire&#x27;s inherent hardness and ductility, together with string tension, thickness, and length. When tuners adjust the tension of the wire during tuning, they establish pitches relative to notes that have already been tuned. Those previously tuned notes have overtones that are sharpened by inharmonicity, which causes the newly established pitch to conform to the sharpened overtone. As the tuning progresses up and down the scale, the inharmonicity, hence the stretch, accumulates.

It is a common misconception that the Railsback curve demonstrates that the middle of the piano is less inharmonic than the upper and lower regions. It only appears that way because that is where the tuning starts. &quot;Stretch&quot; is a comparative term: by definition, no matter what pitch the tuning begins with there can be no stretch. Further, it is often construed that the upper notes of the piano are especially inharmonic, because they appear to be stretched dramatically. In fact, their stretch is a reflection of the inharmonicity of strings in the middle of the piano. Moreover, the inharmonicity of the upper notes can have no bearing on tuning, because their upper partials are beyond the range of human hearing.

As expected, the graph of the actual tuning is not a smooth curve, but a jagged line with peaks and troughs. This might be the result of imprecise tuning, inexact measurement, or the piano&#x27;s innate variability in string scaling. It has also been suggested with Monte-Carlo simulation that such a shape comes from the way humans match pitch intervals.

==Multiple strings==
All but the lowest notes of a piano have multiple strings tuned to the same frequency. The notes with two strings are called bichords, and those with three strings are called trichords. These allow the piano to have a loud attack with a fast decay but a long sustain in the attack–decay–sustain–release (ADSR) system.

The trichords create a coupled oscillator with three normal modes (with two polarizations each). Since the strings are only weakly coupled, the normal modes have imperceptibly different frequencies. But they transfer their vibrational energy to the sounding board at significantly different rates.

The normal mode in which the three strings oscillate together is most efficient at transferring energy since all three strings pull in the same direction at the same time. It sounds loud, but decays quickly. This normal mode is responsible for the rapid staccato &quot;attack&quot; part of the note.

In the other two normal modes, strings do not all pull together, e.g., one pulls up while the other two pull down. There is a slow transfer of energy to the sounding board, generating a soft but near-constant sustain.

<text>Musine Kokalari (10 February 1917 – 13 August 1983) was an Albanian prose writer and politician in Albania&#x27;s pre-communist period. She was the founder of the Social-Democratic Party of Albania in 1943. Kokalari was one of the first published female writers of Albania. After a short involvement in politics during World War II, she was persecuted by the communist regime in Albania, and not allowed to write anymore. She died in poverty and complete isolation.

==Life==
===Early life===
Musine was born on February 10, 1917, in Adana, southern Turkey. Her grandfather, Hamit Kokalari, had completed his higher studies in theology and philosophy in Turkey and was considered part of the intellectuals of the time in the Gjirokastër area, the region from which he originated. Her father, Reshati, had studied law in Istanbul, where he settled with his family. Musine was the youngest in the family, while she had three other brothers Mumtazi, Vesimi and Hamiti, whom also had a good education, both in the linguistic-literary and legal fields. Three years after her birth, Musine&#x27;s family returned to Albania and settled in their hometown, Gjirokastër.
She grew up among books, music heard on the gramophone and especially fairy tales, stories and traditional Albanian songs, while she also completed a part of primary school in the city. Then she moved to Tirana, near the institute &quot;Motrat Qiriazi&quot; and the high school &quot;Nana Mbretneshë&quot; where she studied until 1937. She achieved excellent results through writings that immediately attracted the attention of personalities of literature, linguistics, philology, ethnography, studies of the folklore of the Albanian intellectual circles with which the young Musine had the opportunity to come in contact. The &quot;Venus&quot; bookstore, owned by her brother Vesimi, became an important point of reference and cultural deepening in the Albanian capital, also played a role in such relations; as well as the publishing house &quot;Mesagjeritë shqiptare&quot; led by her other brother, Mumtazi, through which basic works such as those by Edgar Allan Poe, Walter Scott, Shakespeare, Omar Khajami, Vicente Blasco Ibáñez were translated and published.

In 1937, she started publishing a number of articles on social issues in the &quot;Shtypi&quot; newspaper writing under the moniker &quot;Muza (the Muse)&quot; which itself is a pun of its real name.

In 1938, Musine would leave for Rome to begin her university studies at Università degli Studi di Roma &quot;La Sapienza&quot;. A year later she wrote her first professional work called &quot;Sic me thote nenua plakë&quot; &quot;(As the old woman told me)&quot;, a book which would be published only in 1941 in Tirana. With her publications Musine had managed to arouse the interest of important writers such as Lasgush Poradeci, Ali Asllani and above all, Ernest Koliqi, whom at &quot;La Sapienza&quot; was the founder of the &quot;Institute of Albanian Studies&quot;. Koliqi quickly became a fundamental point of reference for the young writer and researcher, a model to be followed both in the scientific and poetic-literary field. Under the supervision of Namik Resuli, Musine worked on her doctoral thesis on Naim Frashëri (1846–1900). Through long archival research for which she was assisted by the grandson of the great poet, Mit&#x27;hat Frashëri, she illustrates in detail the multifaceted aspects that in Albania have made Naim Frashëri a symbol of national literature.

===Political career and imprisonment===

As World War II came to an end, Kokalari herself opened a bookstore and was invited to become a member of the Albanian League of Writers and Artists, created on October 7, 1945, under the chairmanship of Sejfulla Malëshova. All the time she was haunted by the execution without trial of her two brothers, Mumtaz and Vejsim, on November 12, 1944, by the communists and candidly demanded justice and retribution. Having herself been closely associated in 1944 with the fledgling Albanian Social-Democratic party and its press organ &quot;Zëri i lirisë&quot; (&quot;The voice of freedom&quot;), she was arrested on January 17, 1946, in an age of terror concomitant with the arrest of Malëshova, and on July 2, 1946, was sentenced to twenty years in prison by the military court of Tirana as a &quot;saboteur and enemy of the people.&quot;

Right before her arrest Kokalari had sent a letter to the Allied Forces, which were still based in the Albanian capital, Tirana. In her letter she called for free elections and freedom of expression. At the trial, Kokalari stated the following:
I don&#x27;t need to be a communist to love my country. I love my country even though I am not a communist. I love its progress. You boast that you have won the war, and now you are the winner you want to extinguish those who you call political opponents. I think differently from you but I love my country. You are punishing me for my ideals!
===Life in internment and death===
In 1964, after 18 years in the Prison of Burrel in the District of Mat region, isolated and under constant surveillance, she spent the following next 19 years of her life in internment in the town of Rrëshen, Northern Albania, where she had to work as a street sweeper. She was never allowed to resume her writing.

She died in August 1983, in extreme poverty, after a swift battle with cancer.

==Publications==
She had, at the age of twenty-four, indeed already published an initial 80-page collection of ten youthful prose tales in her native Gjirokastrian dialect: &quot;As my old mother tells me&quot; (), Tirana, 1941. This historic collection, strongly inspired by Tosk folklore and by the day-by-day struggles of women of Gjirokastër, is thought to be the first work of literature ever written and published by a woman in Albania. Their value consists of the very lively dialect of Gjirokastër and the prevailing mores of the region. Kokalari called the book, &quot;the mirror of a world gone by, the path of transition from girlhood with its melodies and the first years of marriage to the world of the grown woman, once again bound by the heavy chains of slavery to patriarchal fanaticism.&quot;

In mid-1943 Musine together with Nexhmije Xhuglini Hoxha founded the magazine for women &quot;Shqiptarja e Re&quot;. This magazine continued throughout the dictatorship and was the first avenue for women&#x27;s stories after Albanian&#x27;s liberation and it was published by Albanian United Women organisation chaired by Nexhimije Hoxha from 1946–1952. With Musine&#x27;s craft and talent as a writer enabled its publishing whilst she was arrested and during her trial in June 1946, this very magazine called her a terrorist and appealed to &quot;People&#x27;s Justice&quot; to pass on Musine Kokalari the heaviest punishment. Three years later, despite the vicissitudes of World War II, Kokalari now twenty-seven, was able to publish a longer collection of short stories and sketches entitled &quot;How life swayed&quot; (), Tirana, 1944, a total of 348-pages which established her—ever so briefly—as a writer of substance. A third volume of her folksy tales was entitled &quot;Around the Hearth&quot; (), Tirana, 1944.

==Recognition==

Kokalari was one of the first 30 imprisoned writers to be listed in 1960 by the Committee of the Three (precursor of International PEN). In 1993 Kokalari was posthumously declared a &quot;Martyr of Democracy&quot; by the President of Albania and a school in Tirana now bears her name.

She is one of the principal subjects of the essay collection &quot;No Man&#x27;s Lands: eight extraordinary women in Balkan history&quot;, by the Anglo-Kosovan writers Elizabeth Gowing and Robert Wilton.

<doc id="333088" wikidata="Q1366707" url="?curid=333088" title="Esalen Institute">
<text>The Esalen Institute, commonly called Esalen, is a non-profit American retreat center and intentional community in Big Sur, California, which focuses on humanistic alternative education. The institute played a key role in the Human Potential Movement beginning in the 1960s. Its innovative use of encounter groups, a focus on the mind-body connection, and their ongoing experimentation in personal awareness introduced many ideas that later became mainstream.

Esalen was founded by Michael Murphy and Dick Price in 1962. Their intention was to support alternative methods for exploring human consciousness, what Aldous Huxley described as &quot;human potentialities&quot;. Over the next few years, Esalen became the center of practices and beliefs that make up the New Age movement, from Eastern religions/philosophy, to alternative medicine and mind-body interventions, from transpersonal to Gestalt practice.

Price ran the institute until he died in a hiking accident in 1985. In 2012, the board hired professional executives to help raise money and keep the institute profitable. Until 2016, Esalen offered over 500 workshops yearly in areas including Gestalt practice, personal growth, meditation, massage, yoga, psychology, ecology, spirituality, and organic food. In 2016, about 15,000 people attended its workshops.

In February 2017, the institute was cut off when Highway 1 was closed by a mud slide on either side of the hot springs. It closed its doors, evacuated guests via helicopter, and was forced to lay off 90% of its staff through at least July, when they reopened with limited workshop offerings. It also decided to revamp its offerings to include topics more relevant to a younger generation. As of July 2017, due to the limited access resulting from the road closures, the hot springs are only open to Esalen guests.

== Early history ==
The grounds of the Esalen Institute were first home to a Native American tribe known as the Esselen, from whom the institute adopted its name. Carbon dating tests of artifacts found on Esalen&#x27;s property have indicated a human presence as early as 2600 BCE.

The location was homesteaded by Thomas Slate on September 9, 1882, when he filed a land patent under the Homestead Act of 1862. The settlement became known as Slates Hot Springs. It was the first tourist-oriented business in Big Sur, frequented by people seeking relief from physical ailments. In 1910, the land was purchased by Henry Murphy, a Salinas, California, physician. The official business name was &quot;Big Sur Hot Springs&quot; although it was more generally referred to as &quot;Slate&#x27;s Hot Springs&quot;.

== Founding ==

=== Stanford grads meet ===

Michael Murphy and Dick Price both attended Stanford University in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Both had developed an interest in human psychology and earned degrees in the subject in 1952. Price was influenced by a lecture he heard Aldous Huxley give in 1960 titled &quot;Human Potentialities&quot;. After graduating from Stanford, Price attended Harvard University to continue studying psychology. Murphy, meanwhile, traveled to Sri Aurobindo&#x27;s ashram in India where he resided for several months before returning to San Francisco.

Price&#x27;s parents involuntarily committed him to a mental hospital for a year, ending on November 26, 1957. He hated the experience and thought he would like to create an environment where people could explore new ideas and thoughts without judgment and influence from the outside world. In May 1960, Price returned to San Francisco and lived at the East-West House with Taoist teacher Gia-Fu Feng. That year he met fellow Stanford University graduate Michael Murphy at Haridas Chaudhuri’s Cultural Integration Fellowship where Murphy was in residence. They met at the suggestion of Frederic Spiegelberg, a Stanford professor of comparative religion and studies, with whom both had studied.

By then they had both dropped out of their graduate programs (Price at Harvard and Murphy at Stanford), and had served time in the military. Their similar experiences and interests were the basis for the partnership that created Esalen. Inspired by Buddhist practices, and based on his own understanding of Taoism, Price developed his teachings. He took what Fritz Perls had taught him and created a &quot;Gestalt Awareness&quot; process that is still taught and followed by many today.

=== Lease property ===

Price and Murphy wanted to create a venue where non-traditional workshops and lecturers could present their ideas free of the dogma associated with traditional education. The two began drawing up plans for a forum that would be open to ways of thinking beyond the constraints of mainstream academia while avoiding the dogma so often seen in groups organized around a single idea promoted by a charismatic leader. They envisioned offering a wide range of philosophies, religious disciplines and psychological techniques.

In 1961, they went to look at property owned by the Murphy family at Slates Hot Springs in Big Sur. It included a run-down hotel occupied in part by members of a Pentecostal church. The property was patrolled by gun-toting Hunter S. Thompson. Gay men from San Francisco filled the baths on the weekends.

Henry Murphy&#x27;s widow and Michael&#x27;s grandmother Vinnie &quot;Bunnie&quot; MacDonald Murphy, who owned the property, lived away in Salinas. She had previously refused to lease the property to anyone, even turning down an earlier request from Michael. She was afraid her grandson was going to &quot;give the hotel to the Hindus,&quot; Murphy later said. Not long after, Thompson attempted to visit the baths with friends and got into a fistfight after antagonizing some of the gay men present. The men almost tossed him over the cliff. Murphy&#x27;s father, a lawyer, finally persuaded his mother to allow her grandson to take over and she agreed to lease the property to them in 1962. The two men used capital that Price obtained from his father, who was a vice-president at Sears. They incorporated their business as a non-profit named Esalen Institute in 1963.

=== Develop counterculture workshops ===

Murphy and Price were assisted by Spiegelberg, Watts, Huxley and his wife Laura, as well as by Gerald Heard and Gregory Bateson. They modeled the concept of Esalen partially upon Trabuco College, founded by Heard as a quasi-monastic experiment in the mountains east of Irvine, California, and later donated to the Vedanta Society. Their intent was to provide &quot;a forum to bring together a wide variety of approaches to enhancement of the human potential... including experiential sessions involving encounter groups, sensory awakening, gestalt awareness training, related disciplines.&quot; They stated that they did not want to be viewed as a &quot;cult&quot; or a new church but that it was to be a center where people could explore the concepts that Price and Murphy were passionate about. The philosophy of Esalen lies in the idea that &quot;the cosmos, the universe itself, the whole evolutionary unfoldment is what a lot of philosophers call slumbering spirit. The divine is incarnate in the world and is present in us and is trying to manifest,&quot; according to Murphy.

Alan Watts gave the first lecture at Esalen in January 1962. Gia-fu Feng joined Price and Murphy, along with Bob Breckenridge, Bob Nash, Alice and Jim Sellers, as the first Esalen staff members. In the middle of that same year Abraham Maslow, a prominent humanistic psychologist, just happened to drive into the grounds and soon became an important figure at the institute. In the fall of 1962, they published a catalog advertising workshops with such titles as &quot;Individual and Cultural Definitions of Rationality,&quot; &quot;The Expanding Vision&quot; and &quot;Drug-Induced Mysticism&quot;. Their first seminar series in the fall of 1962 was &quot;The Human Potentiality,&quot; based on a lecture by Huxley.

=== Fritz Perls residency ===

In 1964, Fritz Perls began what became a five-year long residency at Esalen, leaving a lasting influence. Perls offered many Gestalt therapy seminars at the institute until he left in July 1969. Jim Simkin and Perls led Gestalt training courses at Esalen. Simkin started a Gestalt training center on property next door that was later incorporated into Esalen&#x27;s main campus.

When Perls left Esalen he considered it to be &quot;in crisis again&quot;. He saw young people without any training leading encounter groups and he feared that charlatans would take the lead. Later, Grogan would write that Perls’ practice at Esalen had been ethically &quot;questionable&quot;, and according to Kripal, Perls insulted Abraham Maslow.

=== Gestalt practice developed ===
Dick Price became one of Perls&#x27; closest students. Price managed the institute and developed his own form he called Gestalt practice, which he taught at Esalen until his death in a hiking accident in 1985. Michael Murphy lived in the San Francisco Bay Area and wrote non-fiction books about Esalen-related topics, as well as several novels.

=== Leads counterculture movement ===

Esalen gained popularity quickly and started to regularly publish catalogs full of programs. The facility was large enough to run multiple programs simultaneously, so Esalen created numerous resident teacher positions. Murphy recruited Will Schutz, the well-known encounter group leader, to take up permanent residence at Esalen. All this combined to firmly position Esalen in the nexus of the counterculture of the 1960s.

The institute gained increased attention in 1966 when several magazines wrote about it. George Leonard published an article in &quot;Look&quot; magazine about the California scene which mentioned Esalen and included a picture of Murphy. &quot;Time&quot; magazine published an article about Esalen in September 1967. &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; published an article by Leo E. Litwak in late December. &quot;Life&quot; also published an article about the resort. These articles increased the media and the public&#x27;s awareness of the institute in the U.S. and abroad. Esalen responded by holding large-scale conferences in Midwestern and East Coast cities, as well as in Europe. Esalen opened a satellite center in San Francisco that offered extensive programming until it closed in the mid-1970s for financial reasons.

== Programs and management ==
The institute continues to offer workshops about humanistic psychology, physical wellness, and spiritual awareness. The institute has also added workshops on permaculture and ecological sustainability. Other workshops cover a wide range of subjects including arts, health, Gestalt practice, integral thought, martial arts, massage, dance, mythology, philosophical inquiry, somatics, spiritual and religious studies, ecopsychology, wilderness experience, yoga, tai chi, mindfulness practice, and meditation. The institute was closed for the first half of 2017 and forced to drastically reduce staff. They also decided to revamp their offerings upon reopening to include topics more relevant to a younger generation.

=== Center for Theory and Research ===

In 1998, Esalen launched the Center for Theory and Research to initiate new areas of practice and action which foster social change and realization of the human potential. It is the research and development arm of Esalen Institute. , Michael Cornwall, who previously worked in the institutes&#x27; Schizophrenia Research Project at Agnews State Hospital, was conducting workshops titled the &quot;Alternative Views and Approaches to Psychosis Initiative&quot; at Esalen. He was inviting leaders in the field of psychosis treatment to attend the workshops.

=== Management changes ===

Esalen has been making changes to respond to internal and external factors. Dick Price was the key leader of the institute until his sudden death in a hiking accident in late 1985 brought about many changes in personnel and programming. Steven Donovan became president of the institute, and Brian Lyke served as general manager. Nancy Lunney became the director of programming, and Dick Price&#x27;s son David Price served as general manager of Esalen beginning in the mid-1990s.

The baths were destroyed in 1998 by severe weather and were rebuilt at great expense, but this caused severe institutional stress. Afterward, Andy Nusbaum developed an economic plan to stabilize Esalen&#x27;s finances.

In 2011, the institute commissioned the company Beyond the Leading Edge to conduct a Leadership Culture Survey to assess the quality of its leadership culture. The results were negative. The survey measured how well the leadership &quot;builds quality relationships, fosters teamwork, collaborates, develops people, involves people in decision making and planning, and demonstrates a high level of interpersonal skill.&quot; In the &quot;relating dimension&quot; the survey returned a score of 18%, compared to a desired 88%. It also produced strongly dissonant scores in measures of community welfare, relating with interpersonal intelligence, clearly communicating vision, and building a sense of personal worth within the community. It ranked management as overly compliant and lacking authenticity. However, the survey found that Esalen closely matched its overall goal for customer focus.

Gordon Wheeler dramatically restructured Esalen management. These changes prompted Christine Stewart Price, the widow of Dick Price, to withdraw from the institute, and found an organization named the Tribal Ground Circle with the intention to preserve Dick Price&#x27;s legacy.

=== Early leaders and programs ===

In the few years after its founding, many of the seminars like &quot;The Value of Psychotic Experience&quot; attempted to challenge the status quo. There were even Esalen programs that questioned the movement of which Esalen itself was a part—for instance, &quot;Spiritual and Therapeutic Tyranny: The Willingness To Submit&quot;. There were also a series of encounter groups focused on racial prejudice.

Early leaders included many well-known individuals, including Ansel Adams, Gia-fu Feng, Buckminster Fuller, Timothy Leary,
Robert Nadeau, Linus Pauling, Carl Rogers, Virginia Satir, B.F. Skinner, and Arnold Toynbee. Rather than merely lecturing, many leaders experimented with what Huxley called the non-verbal humanities: the education of the body, the senses, and the emotions. Their intention was to help individuals develop awareness of their present flow of experience, to express this fully and accurately, and to listen to feedback. These &quot;experiential&quot; workshops were particularly well attended and were influential in shaping Esalen&#x27;s future course.
===Staff residency===

Because of Esalen&#x27;s isolated location, its operational staff members have lived on site from the beginning and for many years collectively contributed to the character of the institute. The community has been steeped in a form of Gestalt practice that pervades all aspects of daily life, including meeting structures, workplace practices, and individual language styles. There is a preschool on site called the Gazebo, serving the children of staff, some program participants, and affiliated local residents.

=== Scholars in residence ===

Esalen has sponsored long-term resident scholars, including notable individuals such as Gregory Bateson, Joseph Campbell, Stanislav Grof, Sam Keen, George Leonard, Fritz Perls, Ida Rolf, Virginia Satir, William Schutz, and
Alan Watts.

=== Esalen Massage and Bodywork Association ===

Bodywork has always been a significant part of the Esalen experience. In the late 1990s, the &quot;EMBA&quot; was organized as a semi-autonomous Esalen association for the regulation of Esalen massage practitioners.

== Past initiatives and projects ==

Esalen Institute has sponsored many research initiatives, educational projects, and invitational conferences. The Big Sur facility has been used for these events, as well as other locations, including international sites.

=== Arts events ===

In 1964, Joan Baez led a workshop entitled &quot;The New Folk Music&quot; which included a free performance. This was the first of seven &quot;Big Sur Folk Festivals&quot; featuring many of the era&#x27;s music legends. The 1969 concert included musicians who had just come from the Woodstock Festival. This event was featured in a documentary movie, &quot;Celebration at Big Sur&quot;, which was released in 1971.

John Cage and Robert Rauschenberg performed together at Esalen. Robert Bly, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, Michael McClure, Kenneth Rexroth (who led one of the first workshops), Gary Snyder and others held poetry readings and workshops.

In 1994, president and CEO Sharon Thom created an artist-in-residence program to provide artists with a two-week retreat in which to focus upon works in progress. These artists interacted with the staff, offered informal gatherings, and staged performances on the newly created dance platform. Located next to the Art Barn, the dance platform was used by Esalen teachers for dance and martial arts. The platform was later covered by a dome and renamed the Leonard Pavilion after deceased Esalen past president and board member, George Leonard.

In 1995 and 1996, Esalen hosted two arts festivals which gathered together artists, poets, musicians, photographers and performers, including artist Margot McLean, psychotherapist James Hillman, guitarist Michael Hedges and Joan Baez. All staff members were allowed to attend every class and performance that did not interfere with their schedules. Arts festivals have since become a popular yearly event at Esalen.

=== Schizophrenia Research Project ===

Encouraged by Dick Price, the Schizophrenia Research Project was conducted over a three-year period at Agnews State Hospital in San Jose, California, involving 80 young males diagnosed with schizophrenia. Funded in part by Esalen Institute, this program was co-sponsored by the California Department of Mental Hygiene (reorganized: CMHSA) and the National Institute of Mental Health. It explored the thesis that the health of certain patients would permanently improve if their psychotic process was not interrupted by administration of antipsychotic pharmaceutical drugs. Julian Silverman was chief of research for the project. He also served as Esalen&#x27;s general manager in the 1970s. The Agnews double blind study was the largest first-episode psychosis research project ever conducted in the United States. It demonstrated that the young men given a placebo had a 75 percent lower re-hospitalization rate and much better outcomes than the men who received anti-psychotic medication. These results were used as justification for medication-free programs in the San Francisco Bay Area. Esalen has recently begun to revive some of this interest in schizophrenia and psychosis, and hosted the R.D. Laing Symposium and workshops on compassionately responding to psychosis.

=== Publishing ===

Starting in 1969, in association with Viking Press, the institute published a series of 17 books about Esalen-related topics, including the first edition of Michael Murphy&#x27;s novel, &quot;Golf in the Kingdom&quot; (1971). Some of these books remain in print. In the mid-1980s, Esalen entered into a joint publishing arrangement with Lindisfarne Press to publish a small library of Russian philosophical and theological books.

=== Soviet–American Exchange Program ===
In 1979, Esalen began the Soviet–American Exchange Program (later renamed: Track Two, an institute for citizen diplomacy). This initiative came at a time when Cold War tensions were at their peak. The program was credited with substantial success in fostering peaceful private exchanges between citizens of the &quot;super powers&quot;. In the 1980s, Michael Murphy and his wife Dulce were instrumental in organizing the program with Soviet citizen Joseph Goldin, in order to provide a vehicle for citizen-to-citizen relations between Russians and Americans. In 1982, Esalen and Goldin pioneered the first U.S.–Soviet Space Bridge, allowing Soviet and American citizens to speak directly with one another via satellite communication. In 1988, Esalen brought Abel Aganbegyan, one of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s chief economic advisors, to the United States. In 1989, Esalen brought Boris Yeltsin on his first trip to the United States, although Yeltsin did not visit the Esalen facility in Big Sur. Esalen arranged meetings for Yeltsin with then President George H. W. Bush as well as many other leaders in business and government. Two former presidents of the exchange program included Jim Garrison and Jim Hickman. After Gorbachev stepped down, and effectively dissolved the Soviet Union, Garrison helped establish The State of the World Forum, with Gorbachev as its convening chairman. These successes led to other Esalen citizen diplomacy programs, including exchanges with China, an initiative to further understanding among Jews, Christians and Muslims, as well as further work on Russian-American relations.

== Prices and finances ==

=== 2017 closure ===

On February 12, 2017, a number of mud and land slides closed Highway 1 in several locations to the south and north of the hot springs and caused Esalen to partially shut down. On February 18, 2017, shifting earth damaged a pier supporting the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge north of Esalen and forced CalTrans to close Highway 1. CalTrans determined that the bridge was damaged beyond repair and announced an accelerated project to replace the bridge by September. Following closure of the bridge, Esalen was cut off, and resorted to evacuating dozens of guests by helicopter. A landslide at Mud Creek south of the hot springs severely restricted vehicle access to the resort, and Esalen temporarily closed its doors. Then, on May 20, 2017, a new slide at Mud Creek closed Highway 1 for at least a year.

On June 20, Esalen announced that it would lay off 45 staff members through at least July, leaving only about 10 percent of its staff.

Esalen partially reopened on July 28, 2017, offering limited workshops. It plans to add more seminars after the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge reopens in September 2017.

=== Attendance and costs ===

In 2012, 600 Esalen workshops were attended by more than 12,000 people. Topics ranged from sustainable business practices to hypnosis to &quot;The Holy Fool: Crazy Wisdom From Van Gogh to Tina Fey and The Big Lebowski.&quot;

, a weekend workshop, including the program, meals, and a place for a sleeping bag in a communal area, cost a minimum of $405 per person. A couple could rent a private room for $730 per person. Week-long workshops begin at $900 and couples are charged $1,700 per person to stay in a private room. In 2013, the institute charges participants in its month-long, residential licensed massage practitioner training programs, $4910, including board and room. In 1987, a weekend workshop along with a single room and meals cost $270, and a five-day workshop cost $530.

=== Revenue and expenses ===

In 2013, the institute reported revenue of $18,513,254, $13,066,407 from programs, and after expenses of $13,515,552 a net income of $4,997,702. In that year it paid CEO Patricia McEntee $152,077 In 2014, it reported total revenue of $15,934,586, expenses totalling $14,472,201, and net income of $1,462,385. McEntee was paid $157,839.

The company spent nearly $10 million for renovations from 2014 to 2016, including $7.4 million to renovate the main lodge and add a cafe and bar. It also spent $1.8 million on a six-room guesthouse. There is only limited internet cellular service available, but Esalen is planning to make some of its workshops available to online participants.

=== Lease terms ===

The annual cost of its 87-year lease for the 27-acre site from the Vinnie A. Murphy Trust—which extends through 2049—was $344,704 in 2014. McEntee told the &quot;Monterey County Weekly&quot; that the cost of the lease is highly discounted, and that the terms of the lease allow the trust to re-assess the lease terms in 2017. This could potentially increase the institute&#x27;s rent to market value.

=== Cultural influence ===

Esalen has been cited as having played a key role in the cultural transformations of the 1960s. In its beginnings as a &quot;laboratory for new thought&quot;, it was seen by some as the headquarters of the human potential movement. Its use of encounter groups, a focus on the mind-body connection, and their ongoing experimentation in personal awareness introduced many ideas to American society that later became mainstream. In its early years, guest lecturers and workshop leaders included many leading thinkers, psychologists, and philosophers including Erik Erikson, Ken Kesey, Alan Watts, John C. Lilly, Buckminster Fuller, Aldous Huxley, Linus Pauling, Fritz Perls, Joseph Campbell, Robert Bly and Carl Rogers.
Esalen has also been the subject of some criticism and controversy. &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote, &quot;For many others in America and around the world, Esalen stands more vaguely for that metaphorical point where ‘East meets West’ and is transformed into something uniquely and mystically American or New Agey. And for a great many others yet, Esalen is simply that notorious bagno-bordello where people had sex and got high throughout the 1960s and 1970s before coming home talking psychobabble and dangling crystals.&quot;

The Human Potential Movement was criticized for espousing an ethic that the inner-self should be freely expressed in order to reach a person&#x27;s true potential. Some people saw this ethic as an aspect of Esalen&#x27;s culture. The historian Christopher Lasch wrote that humanistic techniques encourage narcissistic, spiritual materialistic or self-obsessive thoughts and behaviors. In 1990 a graffiti artist spray painted &quot;Jive shit for rich white folk&quot; on the entrance to Esalen, highlighting class and race issues. Some thought that this was a regression of progress away from true spiritual growth. Michel Houellebecq&#x27;s &quot;Atomised&quot; traces the New Age movement&#x27;s influence on the novel&#x27;s protagonists to older generations&#x27; chance meetings at Esalen.

=== Popular media ===
====Films====
In the comedy-drama &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; (1969), sophisticated Los Angeles residents Bob (played by Robert Culp) and Carol Sanders (Natalie Wood) spend a weekend of emotional honesty at an Esalen-style retreat, after which they return to their life determined to embrace free love and complete openness.

====Literature====
In Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel &quot;Inherent Vice&quot; (2009) and Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s eponymous 2014 film adaptation, the Chryskylodon Institute is modeled after Esalen.

In Norman Rush&#x27;s novel &quot;Mating&quot; (1992), Esalen is referred to as a &quot;twit factory.&quot;

====Television====
The BBC television series, &quot;The Century of the Self&quot; (2002), is critical of the Human Potentials Movement and includes video segments recorded at Esalen.

The &quot;Mad Men&quot; show finale, &quot;Person to Person&quot; (airdate May 17, 2015), features Don and Stephanie staying at an Esalen-like coastline retreat in the year 1970.

In &quot;True Detective&quot; season 2, the Panticapaeum Institute is largely based on the Esalen Institute.

====Music====
On July 10, 1968, The Beatles guitarist George Harrison was given sitar lessons at Esalen by Ravi Shankar for the movie &quot;Raga&quot;.

<doc id="333091" wikidata="Q2555754" url="?curid=333091" title="Valerie Plame">
<text>Valerie Elise Plame (born August 13, 1963) is an American writer, spy, novelist, and former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer. As the subject of the 2003 Plame affair, also known as the CIA leak scandal, Plame&#x27;s identity as a CIA officer was leaked to and subsequently published by Robert Novak of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. She described this period and the media firestorm that ensued as &quot;mortifying, and I think I was in shock for a couple years&quot;.

In the aftermath of the scandal, Richard Armitage in the U.S. Department of State was identified as one source of the information, and Scooter Libby, Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, was convicted of lying to investigators. After a failed appeal, President George W. Bush commuted Libby&#x27;s sentence and in 2018, President Donald Trump pardoned him. The individual responsible for leaking the information was never charged.

In collaboration with a ghostwriter, Plame wrote a memoir detailing her career and the events leading up to her resignation from the CIA. She has subsequently written and published at least two spy novels. A 2010 biographical feature film, &quot;Fair Game&quot;, was produced based on memoirs by her and her husband.

Plame was an unsuccessful candidate for New Mexico&#x27;s 3rd congressional district in 2020, placing second behind Teresa Leger Fernandez in the June 2, 2020, primary.

== Early life and education ==
Valerie Elise Plame was born on August 13, 1963, on Elmendorf Air Force Base, in Anchorage, Alaska, to Diane (née McClintock) and Samuel Plame III. Plame says that her paternal grandfather was Jewish, the son of a rabbi who emigrated from Ukraine; the original family surname was &quot;Plamevotski&quot;. The rest of Plame&#x27;s family was Protestant (the religion in which Plame was raised); she was unaware, until she was an adult, that her grandfather was Jewish.

She graduated in 1981 from Lower Moreland High School, in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, and in 1985 from Pennsylvania State University, with a B.A. in advertising. While attending Penn State, she joined Pi Beta Phi sorority and worked for the business division of the &quot;Daily Collegian&quot; student newspaper.

==Career==
After graduating from college and moving to Washington, D.C., Plame worked at a clothing store while awaiting results of her application to the CIA. She was accepted into the 1985–86 CIA officer training class. Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald affirmed that Plame &quot;was a CIA officer from January 1, 2002, forward&quot; and that &quot;her association with the CIA was classified at that time through July 2003.&quot; Details about Plame&#x27;s professional career are still classified, but it is documented that she worked for the CIA in a non-official cover (or NOC) capacity relating to counter-proliferation.

Plame served the CIA at times as a non-official cover, operating in Athens and Brussels. While using her own name, &quot;Valerie Plame&quot;, her assignments required posing in various professional roles in order to gather intelligence more effectively. Two of her covers include serving as a junior consular officer in the early 1990s in Athens and then later as an energy analyst for the private company (founded in 1994) &quot;Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates,&quot; which the CIA later acknowledged was a front company for certain investigations. A former senior diplomat in Athens remembered Plame in her dual role and also recalled that she served as one of the &quot;control officers&quot; coordinating the visit of President George H. W. Bush to Greece and Turkey in July 1991. The matter of whether she actually had covert status is disputed. After the Persian Gulf War in 1991, the CIA sent her first to the London School of Economics and then the College of Europe, in Bruges, for master&#x27;s degrees. After earning the second degree, she stayed on in Brussels, where she began her next assignment under cover as an &quot;energy consultant&quot; for Brewster-Jennings. Beginning in 1997, Plame&#x27;s primary assignment was shifted to the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

During this time, part of her work concerned the determination of the use of aluminum tubes purchased by Iraq. CIA analysts prior to the Iraq invasion were quoted by the White House as believing that Iraq was trying to acquire nuclear weapons and that these aluminum tubes could be used in a centrifuge for nuclear enrichment. David Corn and Michael Isikoff argued that the undercover work being done by Plame and her CIA colleagues in the Directorate of Central Intelligence Nonproliferation Center strongly contradicted such a claim.

=== &quot;Plamegate&quot; ===
On July 14, 2003, Robert Novak, a journalist for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, used information obtained from Richard Armitage, Karl Rove, and Scooter Libby, to reveal Plame&#x27;s identity as a CIA operative in his column. Legal documents published in the course of the CIA leak grand jury investigation, &quot;United States v. Libby&quot;, and Congressional investigations, established her classified employment as a covert officer for the CIA at the time when Novak&#x27;s column was published in July 2003.

In his press conference on October 28, 2005, Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald explained the necessity of secrecy about his grand jury investigation that began in the fall of 2003—&quot;when it was clear that Valerie Wilson&#x27;s cover had been blown&quot;—and the background and consequences of the indictment of then high-ranking Bush Administration official Scooter Libby as it pertained to her.

Fitzgerald&#x27;s subsequent replies to reporters&#x27; questions shed further light on the parameters of the leak investigation and what, as its lead prosecutor, bound by the rules of grand jury secrecy, he could and could not reveal legally at the time. Official court documents released later, on April 5, 2006, reveal that Libby testified that &quot;he was specifically authorized in advance&quot; of his meeting with Judith Miller, reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, to disclose the &quot;key judgments&quot; of the October 2002 classified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE). According to Libby&#x27;s testimony, &quot;the Vice President later advised him that the President had authorized defendant to disclose the relevant portions of the NIE [to Judith Miller].&quot; According to his testimony, the information that Libby was authorized to disclose to Miller &quot;was intended to rebut the allegations of an administration critic, former ambassador Joseph Wilson.&quot; A couple of days after Libby&#x27;s meeting with Miller, then–National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice told reporters, &quot;We don&#x27;t want to try to get into kind of selective declassification&quot; of the NIE, adding, &quot;We&#x27;re looking at what can be made available.&quot; A &quot;sanitized version&quot; of the NIE in question was officially declassified on July 18, 2003, ten days after Libby&#x27;s contact with Miller, and was presented at a White House background briefing on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq. The NIE contains no references to Valerie Plame or her CIA status, but the Special Counsel has suggested that White House actions were part of &quot;a plan to discredit, punish or seek revenge against Mr. Wilson.&quot; President Bush had previously indicated that he would fire whoever had outed Plame.

A court filing by Libby&#x27;s defense team argued that Plame was not foremost in the minds of administration officials as they sought to rebut charges—made by her husband—that the White House manipulated intelligence to make a case for invasion. The filing indicated that Libby&#x27;s lawyers did not intend to say that he was told to reveal Plame&#x27;s identity. The court filing also stated that &quot;Mr. Libby plans to demonstrate that the indictment is wrong when it suggests that he and other government officials viewed Ms. Wilson&#x27;s role in sending her husband to Africa as important,&quot; indicating that Libby&#x27;s lawyers planned to call Karl Rove to the stand. Fitzgerald ultimately decided against pressing charges against Rove.

The five-count indictment of Libby included perjury (two counts), obstruction of justice (one count), and making false statements to federal investigators (two counts). There was, however, no count for disclosing classified information, i.e., Plame&#x27;s status as a CIA operative.

===Libby trial===

On March 6, 2007, Libby was convicted of obstruction of justice, making false statements, and two counts of perjury. He was acquitted on one count of making false statements. He was not charged for revealing Plame&#x27;s CIA status. His sentence included a $250,000 fine, 30 months in prison and two years of probation. On July 2, 2007, President George W. Bush commuted Libby&#x27;s sentence, removing the jail term but leaving in place the fine and probation, calling the sentence &quot;excessive.&quot; In a subsequent press conference, on July 12, 2007, Bush noted, &quot;...the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision.&quot; The Wilsons responded to the commutation in statements posted by their legal counsel, Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), and on their own legal support website. President Donald Trump pardoned Libby on April 13, 2018.

=== &quot;Wilson v. Cheney&quot; ===
On July 13, 2006, Joseph and Valerie Wilson filed a civil lawsuit against Rove, Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney, and other unnamed senior White House officials (to whom they later added Richard Armitage) for their alleged role in the public disclosure of Valerie Wilson&#x27;s classified CIA status. Judge John D. Bates dismissed the Wilsons&#x27; lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds on July 19, 2007; the Wilsons appealed. On August 12, 2008, in a 2-1 decision, the three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the dismissal. Melanie Sloan, of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which represents the Wilsons, said &quot;the group will request the full D.C. Circuit to review the case and appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.&quot; Agreeing with the Bush administration, the Obama Justice Department argued the Wilsons have no legitimate grounds to sue. On the current justice department position, Sloan stated: &quot;We are deeply disappointed that the Obama administration has failed to recognize the grievous harm that Bush White House officials inflicted on Joe and Valerie Wilson. The government&#x27;s position cannot be reconciled with President Obama&#x27;s oft-stated commitment to once again make government officials accountable for their actions.&quot;

On June 21, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal.

===House Oversight Committee hearing===
On March 8, 2007, two days after the verdict in the Libby trial, Congressman Henry Waxman, chair of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, announced that his committee would ask Plame to testify on March 16, in an effort by his committee to look into &quot;whether White House officials followed appropriate procedures for safeguarding Plame&#x27;s identity.&quot;

On March 16, 2007, at these hearings about the disclosure, Waxman read a statement about Plame&#x27;s CIA career that had been cleared by CIA director Gen. Michael V. Hayden and the CIA, stating that she was undercover and that her employment status with the CIA was classified information prohibited from disclosure under Executive Order 12958.

Subsequent reports in various news accounts focused on the following parts of her testimony:

* &quot;My name and identity were carelessly and recklessly abused by senior government officials in the White House and state department&quot;; this abuse occurred for &quot;purely political reasons.&quot;
* After her identity was exposed by officials in the Bush administration, she had to leave the CIA: &quot;I could no longer perform the work for which I had been highly trained.&quot;
* She did not select her husband for a CIA fact-finding trip to Niger, but an officer senior to her selected him and told her to ask her husband if he would consider it: &quot;I did not recommend him. I did not suggest him. There was no nepotism involved. I did not have the authority [...].&quot;

===&quot;Fair Game&quot;===
Plame&#x27;s husband Joseph Wilson announced on March 6, 2007, that the couple had &quot;signed a deal with Warner Bros of Hollywood to offer their consulting services—or maybe more—in the making of the forthcoming movie about the Libby trial,&quot; their lives and the CIA leak scandal. The feature film, a co-production between Weed Road&#x27;s Akiva Goldsman and Jerry and Janet Zucker of Zucker Productions with a screenplay by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth to be based in part on Valerie Wilson&#x27;s memoir &quot;Fair Game&quot; (contingent on CIA clearances) originally scheduled for release in August 2007, but ultimately published on October 22, 2007.

In May 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Valerie Wilson agreed to a $2.5 million book deal with Crown Publishing Group, a division of Random House. Steve Ross, senior vice president and publisher of Crown, told the Times that the book would be her &quot;first airing of her actual role in the American intelligence community, as well as the prominence of her role in the lead-up to the war.&quot; Subsequently, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that the book deal fell through and that Plame was in exclusive negotiations with Simon &amp; Schuster. Ultimately, Simon and Schuster publicly confirmed the book deal, though not the financial terms and, at first, no set publication date.

On May 31, 2007, various news media reported that Simon and Schuster and Valerie Wilson were suing J. Michael McConnell, Director of National Intelligence, and Michael V. Hayden, Director of the CIA, arguing that the CIA &quot;is unconstitutionally interfering with the publication of her memoir, &quot;Fair Game&quot;, ... set to be published in October [2007], by not allowing Plame to mention the dates that she served in the CIA.&quot; Judge Barbara S. Jones, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, in Manhattan, interpreted the issue in favor of the CIA. Therefore, the ruling stated that Plame would not be able to describe in her memoir the precise dates she had worked for the CIA. In 2009, the federal court of appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed Judge Jones&#x27;s ruling.

On October 31, 2007, in an interview with Charlie Rose broadcast on &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot;, Valerie Wilson discussed many aspects relating to her memoir: the CIA leak grand jury investigation; &quot;United States v. Libby,&quot; the civil suit which she and her husband were at the time still pursuing against Libby, Cheney, Rove, and Armitage; and other matters presented in her memoir relating to her covert work with the CIA.

The film, &quot;Fair Game&quot;, was released November 5, 2010, starring Naomi Watts and Sean Penn. It is based on two books, one written by Plame, and the other by her husband. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; editorial page, led by editor Fred Hiatt, a vocal supporter of the Iraq War, who blamed Wilson for Plame&#x27;s identity being leaked, described the movie as being &quot;full of distortions—not to mention outright inventions&quot;, while news reporters Walter Pincus and Richard Leiby at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; disagreed, saying &quot;The movie holds up as a thoroughly researched and essentially accurate account—albeit with caveats&quot;.

In May 2011, it was announced that Plame would write a series of spy novels with mystery writer Sarah Lovett. The first book in the series, titled &quot;Blowback&quot;, was released on October 1, 2013, by Blue Rider Press, an imprint of the Penguin Group.

===Anti Trump fundraiser ===
In August 2017, Plame set up a GoFundMe fundraising page in an attempt to buy a majority interest in Twitter and kick U.S. President Donald Trump off the network. She launched her campaign because she believes that Donald Trump &#x27;emboldens white supremacists&#x27; and encourages &#x27;violence against journalists&#x27;.

Titled &quot;Let&#x27;s #BuyTwitter and #BanTrump&quot;, she set the campaign&#x27;s goal to $1 billion; her campaign raised $88,000.

=== Antisemitism controversy ===
In September 2017, Plame tweeted a link to an article from &quot;The Unz Review&quot; website posted by Philip Giraldi, titled &quot;America&#x27;s Jews Are Driving America&#x27;s Wars&quot;, repeating the title of the article in her tweet. The article said that certain &quot;American Jews who lack any shred of integrity&quot; should be given a special label when appearing on television: &quot;kind-of-like a warning label on a bottle of rat poison.&quot; Amid criticism, Plame first defended her posts, replying on Twitter that &quot;Many neocon hawks ARE Jewish.&quot; She also said that people should &quot;read the entire article&quot; without &quot;biases&quot;, writing in defense of herself after the initial backlash: &quot;read the entire article, just for a moment, to put aside your biases and think clearly.&quot;

Within two hours, she deleted her initial post and apologized, tweeting &quot;OK folks, look, I messed up. I skimmed this piece, zeroed in on the neocon criticism, and shared it without seeing and considering the rest. I missed gross undercurrents to this article &amp; didn&#x27;t do my homework on the platform this piece came from. Now that I see it, it&#x27;s obvious. Apologies all. There is so much there that&#x27;s problematic AF and I should have recognized it sooner. Thank you for pushing me to look again. I&#x27;m not perfect and make mistakes. This was a doozy. All I can do is admit them, try to be better, and read more thoroughly next time, Ugh.&quot; Ramesh Ponnuru and Caleb Ecarma have argued that the incident followed a pattern of her posting antisemitic content, and of Plame making jokes about &quot;rich Jews&quot;. She had tweeted at least eight articles from the same website before, in which she previously retweeted links to conspiracy theories of &#x27;dancing Israelis&#x27; being behind the 9/11 attacks.

===Congressional run===
In May 2019, Plame announced her candidacy for the United States House of Representatives for in the 2020 elections. The seat, in northern New Mexico, was being vacated by Democratic Representative Ben Ray Luján, who ran for Senate instead. She outspent her rivals with funding from outside her district. On June 2, 2020, she was defeated in the seven-way Democratic primary election by Teresa Leger Fernandez. Fernandez received 44,480 votes, Plame 25,775 votes, and Joseph L. Sanchez 12,292 votes.

== Personal life ==
After graduating from Penn State in 1985, Plame married Todd Sesler; the marriage ended in divorce in 1989. In 1997, while working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Plame met former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson. They were married on April 3, 1998. At the time they met, Wilson related in his memoir, he was separated from his second wife Jacqueline. They divorced after 12 years of marriage so that he could marry Plame. They had two children, twins Trevor Rolph and Samantha Finnell Diana, born in 2000. Wilson and Plame divorced in 2017. Wilson died in 2019. Plame married Dr. Joseph Shepard, President of Western New Mexico University, in 2020.

Prior to the disclosure of her CIA job, the family lived in the Palisades, Washington, D.C. After she resigned from the CIA following the disclosure of her CIA position, in January 2006, the family moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where Plame served as a consultant to the Santa Fe Institute until 2016. In a 2011 interview, Plame said she and Wilson had received threats while living in the D.C. metro area, and that the New Mexico location was calm.

Plame was involved in the 2016 presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

In December 2024 it was reported that Plame&#x27;s husband was resigning his post as WNMU president in exchange for a severance package of nearly $2 million, as he and regents of the university were implicated in charges of wasteful spending. &quot;Plame was not a WNMU employee, she was issued a university credit card, which she used to buy&quot; thousands of dollars of furniture and home and office accessories.

<doc id="333093" wikidata="Q1339242" url="?curid=333093" title="Chief Justice of Canada">
<text>The chief justice of Canada () is the presiding judge of the nine-member Supreme Court of Canada, the highest judicial body in Canada. As such, the chief justice is the highest-ranking judge of the Canadian court system. The &quot;Supreme Court Act&quot; makes the chief justice, a Crown in Council appointment, meaning the Crown acting on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice. The chief justice serves until they resign, turn 75 years old, die, or are removed from office for cause. By tradition, a new chief justice is chosen from among the court&#x27;s incumbent puisne justices.

The chief justice has significant influence in the procedural rules of the Court, presides when oral arguments are held, and leads the discussion of cases among the justices. The chief justice is also deputy governor general, &quot;ex-officio&quot; chairman of the Canadian Judicial Council, and heads the committee that selects recipients of the Order of Canada. Additionally, a chief justice also assumes the role of Administrator of Canada and exercises the viceregal duties of the governor general upon the death, resignation or incapacitation of the governor general.

Richard Wagner has served as the current chief justice of Canada since 2017. Since the Supreme Court was established in 1875, 18 people have served as chief justice. The court&#x27;s first chief justice was William Buell Richards; Beverley McLachlin is the longest serving Canadian chief justice (), and was the first woman to hold the position.

== Appointment ==
The chief justice is appointed by the Governor in Council under the &quot;Supreme Court Act&quot; on the advice of the prime minister. The appointment is subject to the &quot;Supreme Court Act&quot;, which governs the administration and appointment of judges of the court. By this component of the Constitution of Canada, Judges appointed to the court must be &quot;a judge of a superior court of a province or a barrister or advocate of at least ten years standing at the bar of a province.&quot;

Tradition dictates that the chief justice be appointed from among the court&#x27;s puisne judges; in the history of the Court, only two were not: William Buell Richards, and Charles Fitzpatrick. It is also customary that a new chief justice be chosen alternately from among: the three justices who by law must be from Quebec (with its civil law system), and the other six justices from the rest of Canada (representing the common law tradition). Since 1933, this tradition has only been broken once, when Brian Dickson of Manitoba was named to succeed Bora Laskin of Ontario in 1984.

== Duties ==
The chief justice&#x27;s central duty is to preside at hearings before the Supreme Court. The chief justice presides from the centre chair. If the chief justice is absent, the senior puisne judge presides.

===Judicial Council===
The chief justice chairs the Canadian Judicial Council, which is composed of all chief justices and associate chief justices of superior courts in Canada. This body, established in 1971 by the &quot;Judges Act&quot;, organizes seminars for federally appointed judges, coordinates the discussion of issues of concern to the judiciary, and conducts inquiries, either on public complaint or at the request of a federal or provincial minister of justice or attorney general, into the conduct of any federally appointed judge.

=== Other duties ===
The chief justice is sworn as a member of the Privy Council prior to taking the judicial oath of office. The chief justice also sits on the advisory council of Canada&#x27;s highest civilian order, the Order of Canada. In practice however, the chief justice abstains from voting on a candidate&#x27;s removal from the order, presumably because this process has so far only applied to individuals convicted in a lower court of a criminal offence, and could create a conflict of interest for the chief justice if that individual appealed their conviction to the Supreme Court.

Under the &quot;Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act&quot;, each province has a three-person commission responsible for modifying that province&#x27;s federal ridings. The chair of each such commission is appointed by the chief justice of that province; if no appointment is made by the provincial chief justice, the responsibility falls to the chief justice of Canada.

==Administrator of Canada==
The &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; provides that there can be an &quot;Administrator for the Time being carrying on the Government of Canada.&quot; The &quot;Letters Patent, 1947&quot; respecting the Office of Governor General provide that, should the governor general die, become incapacitated, or be absent from the country for a period of more than one month, the chief justice or, if that office is vacant, the senior puisne justice, of the Supreme Court would become Administrator of Canada and exercise all the powers and duties of the governor general. This has happened on four occasions: chief justices Lyman Duff and Robert Taschereau each did so, in 1940 and 1967 respectively, following the death of the incumbent governor general, as did Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin when the Governor General underwent surgery in 2005. With the resignation of Julie Payette in January 2021, Richard Wagner served as Administrator until the appointment of Mary Simon as Governor General in July of the same year.

The chief justice and the other justices of the court serve as deputies of the governor general for the purpose of giving Royal Assent to bills passed by Parliament, signing official documents or receiving credentials of newly appointed high commissioners and ambassadors.

==Current chief justice==
The current chief justice is Richard Wagner, who took office on December 18, 2017, succeeding Beverley McLachlin. Born in Montreal on April 2, 1957, Wagner had been a puisne Supreme Court justice for at the time of his elevation to chief justice. He previously sat on the Quebec Court of Appeal.

==List of chief justices==
Since the Supreme Court was established in 1875, the following 18 persons have served as Chief Justice:

<doc id="333095" wikidata="Q5261068" url="?curid=333095" title="Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand">
<text>The deputy prime minister of New Zealand () is the second-most senior member of the Cabinet of New Zealand. The officeholder usually deputises for the prime minister at official functions. The current deputy prime minister is Winston Peters of the NZ First party, who has held the position twice before, and will serve until 31 May 2025 due to an arrangement under the current coalition government in which he would then be succeeded in the position by ACT party leader David Seymour.

The role existed on an informal basis for as long as the office of prime minister/premier has existed, but the office of &quot;deputy prime minister&quot; was formally established as a ministerial portfolio in 1949. This means that Keith Holyoake is considered the first deputy prime minister. It was formally designated as a full cabinet level position in 1954.

==Appointment and duties==
The post of deputy prime minister was formally established in 1949. Eighteen individuals have held the position (with one of them doing so twice, and one doing so thrice) and of those people: Holyoake, Marshall, Watt, Muldoon, Palmer, Clark and English have eventually served as prime minister. The deputy prime minister has always been a member of the Cabinet, and has always held at least one substantive portfolio.

The deputy prime minister &quot;...can, if necessary&quot; exercise the statutory and constitutional functions and powers of the prime ministership if the prime minister is unavailable or unable. They can also do the same as acting prime minister, in consultation with the prime minister if it is appropriate and practicable. The deputy prime minister can also temporarily act as interim prime minister until the leadership of the government is determined in some cases, like the death of the prime minister.

The position was most commonly held by the deputy leader of the largest party, but since the adoption of the MMP electoral system in 1996 and the greater frequency of coalition governments in New Zealand, the role may instead go to the leader of a junior government party. This has occurred three times with Winston Peters, leader of New Zealand First, and once Jim Anderton, leader of the Alliance. The Sixth National Government, formed in 2023, intends to share the role of deputy prime minister between its two coalition partners for half the term each. Twice, the Labour Party has appointed a senior minister who was not the deputy party leader as the deputy prime minister (Grant Robertson and Carmel Sepuloni).

Little scholarly attention has focused on deputy prime ministers in New Zealand or elsewhere. In 2009, an article by Steven Barnes appeared in &quot;Political Science&quot; where nine &#x27;qualities&#x27; of deputy prime ministership were identified: temperament; relationships with their Cabinet and caucus; relationships with their party; popularity with the public; media skills; achievements as deputy prime minister; relationship with the prime minister; leadership ambition; and method of succession. Barnes conducted a survey of journalists, academics, and former members of parliament to rank New Zealand deputy prime ministers up to that time since 1960. Across the nine deputy prime minister &#x27;qualities&#x27;, Don McKinnon achieved the number one ranking, followed by Brian Talboys, Michael Cullen, and Jack Marshall. In a second &#x27;overall&#x27; ranking, Cullen was ranked number one, followed by Talboys, McKinnon, and Marshall. Winston Peters, Jim Anderton, and Bob Tizard were ranked lowest in both sections of the survey.

<doc id="333096" wikidata="Q2305722" url="?curid=333096" title="Social history of the piano">
<text>The [[social history]] of the [[piano]] is the history of the instrument&#x27;s role in society. The piano was invented at the end of the 17th century, had become widespread in Western society by the end of the 18th, and is still widely played today.
==Early years==
At the time of its origin around the year 1700, the piano was a speculative invention, produced by the well-paid craftsman and inventor Bartolomeo Cristofori for his wealthy patron Ferdinando de Medici, Grand Prince of Florence. As such, it was an extremely expensive item. For some time after its invention, the piano was largely owned by royalty (e.g. the kings of Portugal and Prussia); see Fortepiano for details. Even later on, (i.e. throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries), pianos were financially beyond the reach of most families, and the pianos of those times were generally the property of the gentry and the aristocracy. Visiting music masters taught their children to play the piano.

==Pianos and women==
Both Parakilas and Loesser emphasize a connection during this period between pianos and the female gender; piano study was apparently more common for girls than boys. Despite this, women were discouraged from playing the piano professionally and were encouraged not to take their musical aspirations too seriously. Nevertheless, women were considered more attractive and desirable if they could play the piano. The piano was a symbol of social status, and the ability to play the piano stood as a testament to a woman&#x27;s marriageability.
Women who had learned to play as children often continued to play as adults, thus providing music in their households. For instance, Emma Wedgwood (1808–1896), the granddaughter of the wealthy industrialist Josiah Wedgwood, took piano lessons from Frédéric Chopin and apparently achieved a fair level of proficiency. Following her marriage to Charles Darwin, Emma still played the piano daily, while her husband listened appreciatively.

A number of female piano students became outright &quot;virtuose&quot;, and the skills of woman pianists inspired the work of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, who dedicated difficult-to-play works to their female friends. However, careers as concert musicians were typically open only to men (an important exception was Clara Schumann).

==The spread of the piano in Europe==

When the piano was invented in 1700, it failed to catch the public&#x27;s attention due to its expense and the fact that the harpsichord was the preferred instrument of the time. Very few people knew of the piano until after the Seven Years&#x27; War when a young man named Johannes Zumpe fled Germany for London. While there he refined Cristofori&#x27;s piano, introducing separate sections of black keys as well as treble and bass capabilities. This new piano was extremely difficult to play, and very few people learned how to play the instrument because of this. That changed when Zumpe convinced Johann Christian Bach, the personal music master to Queen Charlotte and an international celebrity, to purchase and play on a Zumpe piano for the first ever Zumpe piano concert in 1768. Because of Bach&#x27;s fame, the piano soon replaced the harpsichord as the predominant instrument of the time, and later composers such as Mozart and Beethoven chose to play on a Zumpe piano.

Bach&#x27;s fame and the interest of Queen Charlotte helped the piano become a symbol of social status. The turn of the 19th century also saw the rise of the middle class in the Western world. This middle class was eager to showcase their social status, and it became the proper Victorian man&#x27;s goal to shower his wife and daughters with leisure time and leisure activities, as leisure was a symbol of social status. Consequently, the piano, which was often used for leisure, stood as a testament to a family&#x27;s position on the socioeconomic ladder.

Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, the middle class of Europe and North America increased in both numbers and prosperity. This increase produced a corresponding rise in the domestic importance of the piano, as ever more families became able to afford pianos and piano instruction. The piano also became common in public institutions, such as schools, hotels, and public houses. As elements of the Western middle-class lifestyle gradually spread to other nations, the piano became common in these nations as well, for example in Japan.

To understand the rise of the piano among the middle class, it is helpful to remember that before mechanical and electronic reproduction, music was in fact performed on a daily basis by ordinary people. For instance, the working people of every nation generated a body of folk music, which was transmitted orally down through the generations and sung by all. The parents of Joseph Haydn (1732–1809) could not read music, yet Haydn&#x27;s father (who worked as a wheelwright) taught himself to play the harp, and the Haydn family frequently played and sang together. With rising prosperity, the many families that could now afford pianos and music adapted their home-grown musical abilities to the new instrument, and the piano became a major source of music in the home.

Amateur pianists in the home often kept track of the doings of the leading pianists and composers of their day. Professional virtuosi wrote books and methods for the study of piano playing, which sold widely. The virtuosi also prepared their own editions of classical works, which included detailed marks of tempo and expression to guide the amateur who wanted to use their playing as a model. (Today, students are usually encouraged to work from an Urtext edition.) The piano compositions of the great composers often sold well among amateurs, despite the fact that, starting with Beethoven, they were often far too hard for anyone but a trained virtuoso to play well. Evidently, the amateur pianists obtained satisfaction from coming to grips with the finest music, even if they could not perform it from start to finish.

A favourite form of musical recreation in the home was playing works for four-hand piano, in which the two players sit side by side at a single piano. These were frequently arrangements of orchestral works, and in the days before recordings served to spread knowledge of new orchestral music to places lacking an orchestra. Sometimes members of the household would sing or play other instruments along with the piano. This practice was often a part of courtship, for performing music together—particularly in the presence or at least earshot of other members of the household—was one of the few &quot;respectable&quot; ways for a young man and young woman from &quot;good&quot; families to be together.

Parents whose children showed unusual talent often pushed them toward professional careers, sometimes making great sacrifices to make this possible. Artur Schnabel&#x27;s book &quot;My Life and Music&quot; vividly depicts his own experience along these lines, which took place in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the late 19th century.

== The spread of the piano in East Asia ==

Pianos were adopted in Japan in the late 19th century, after the Meiji Restoration as part of modernization reforms. To the reformers who were threatened with European domination, the piano functioned as a symbol of international modernity, granting access to a world where western technical expertise and cultural knowledge were valued. This was part of a process of avoiding European colonialism by accepting western cultural practices and institutions, which was quickly internalized by the Meiji government and the people. American missionaries of the German Reformed Church arrived in Japan in 1879, and in the 1880s set up music departments that offered college-level training in western music, including the piano.

In the 1920s, the piano replaced the &quot;koto&quot; as the preferred instrument for Japanese women to cultivate before marriage. The Taishō-era arist Nakamura Daizaburō painted &quot;The Piano&quot; in 1926, which depicts his fiancée dressed in a kimono and performing Robert Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Träumerei&quot; on a Russian piano. Playing the piano was adopted in Japan as part of domestic modernity, as opposed to the traditional and pre-modern conception of musicians as social outcasts. The piano became a source of education, spiritual and moral discipline, and cultural capital useful in the marriage market.

==Decline==
The piano&#x27;s status in the home remained secure until technology made possible the enjoyment of music in passive form. First the player piano (c. 1900), then the home phonograph (which became common in the decade before World War I), then the radio (in the 1920s) dealt severe blows to amateur piano-playing as a form of domestic recreation. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, piano sales dropped sharply, and many manufacturers went out of business. 
Another blow to the piano was the widespread acceptance in the late 20th century of the electronic keyboard. This instrument, in its cheaper forms, is widely considered to provide only a poor substitute for the tonal quality of a good piano (see piano for why), but it is more easily portable, cheaper, much more flexible and in many ways better suited to the performance of popular music.

Nevertheless, the piano survives to this day in many 21st-century homes. The pianos being bought today tend to be of higher quality and more expensive than those of several decades ago, suggesting perhaps that domestic piano playing may have concentrated itself in homes of wealthier or better-educated members of the middle class. It is unlikely that ability to play the piano contributes much these days to the marriageability of daughters, but many parents still feel today that piano lessons teach their children concentration and self-discipline, and open a door into the world of classical music.

<doc id="333100" wikidata="Q2501631" url="?curid=333100" title="Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet is a five-star naval officer rank and the highest rank of the Royal Navy, formally established in 1688. The five-star NATO rank code is OF-10, equivalent to a field marshal in the British Army or a Marshal of the Royal Air Force. Apart from honorary appointments, no new admirals of the fleet have been named since 1995, and no honorary appointments have been made since 2014.

==History==

The origins of the rank can be traced back to John de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp de Warwick, who was appointed &#x27;Admiral of the King&#x27;s Southern, Northern and Western Fleets&#x27; on 18 July 1360. The appointment gave the command of the English navy to one person for the first time; this evolved into the post of Admiral of the Fleet. In the days of sailing ships the admiral distinctions then used by the Royal Navy included distinctions related to the fleet being divided into three divisions – red, white, or blue. Each division was assigned at least one admiral, who in turn commanded a number of vice-admirals and rear admirals. While the full admirals were nominally equals, tradition gave precedence to the Admiral of the White who held the fleet rank in addition to his substantive role.

===Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries===
The Restoration era brought a general reorganisation of naval ranks and structure, including formalisation of the admiral of the fleet role. In a break with tradition the rank was awarded to the most senior Admiral of the Red, who retained this substantive rank while also serving as Admiral of the Fleet. Appointments were for life, remunerated via a £5 daily stipend and an annual allowance of £1,014 for the hiring and maintenance of servants. It was intended that only one officer would hold the rank at any time, with their presence aboard any naval vessel to be denoted by the flying of the Royal Standard from the main mast.

The ranks of Admiral of the Fleet and Admiral of the Red were formally separated from 1805, with an announcement in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; that &quot;His Majesty [has] been pleased to order the Rank of Admirals of the Red to be restored&quot; in His Majesty&#x27;s Navy...&quot; as a separate role. The same &quot;Gazette&quot; promoted 22 men to that rank. From the nineteenth century onward there were also occasional variations to the previous requirement that only one Admiral of Fleet could serve at one time. In 1821 George IV appointed Sir John Jervis as a second admiral of the fleet, to balance the Duke of Wellington″s promotion as a second Field Marshal in the British Army. In 1830 King William IV increased the number of admirals of the fleet to three, though these additional lifetime postings subsequently lapsed. Between 1854 and 1857 there was no admiral of the fleet at all as the most senior naval officer of the time Admiral of the Red Thomas Le Marchant Gosselin was mentally ill and had not served at sea for forty-five years. In deference to Gosselin&#x27;s seniority the position was instead left vacant until his death in 1857, whereupon it was filled by Admiral Charles Ogle.

===Twentieth century===
The organisation of the British fleet into coloured squadrons was abandoned in 1864, though the rank of admiral of the fleet was maintained. The title of First Naval Lord was renamed First Sea Lord in 1904.

During the two World Wars a number of serving officers held active commissions as admirals of the fleet, as well as the First Sea Lorde.g. Sir John Tovey.

Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was created an Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal New Zealand Navy in 1954, following the coronation of his wife Elizabeth II as Queen. This promotion was to a New Zealand rank, separate from the Royal Navy rank.

Following the creation of the Chief of the Defence Staff in 1959, the five naval officers appointed to that position became admirals of the fleet. Recognizing the reduced post–Cold War size of the British Armed Forces, no further appointments were made to the rank after 1995 when Sir Benjamin Bathurst was appointed admiral of the fleet on his retirement as First Sea Lord. The rank was not abolished and in 2012 the Prince of Wales (now King Charles III) became an honorary admiral of the fleet (as well as field marshal and marshal of the Royal Air Force), in recognition of his support to Queen Elizabeth II in her role of as Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces. In 2014, Lord Boyce, a former First Sea Lord and Chief of the Defence Staff, was also appointed an honorary admiral of the fleet.

<text>The dunnock (Prunella modularis) is a small passerine, or perching bird, found throughout temperate Europe and into Asian Russia. Dunnocks have also been successfully introduced into New Zealand. It is the most widespread member of the accentor family; most other accentors are limited to mountain habitats. Other, largely archaic, English names for the dunnock include hedge accentor, hedge sparrow, hedge warbler, and titling.

==Taxonomy==
The dunnock was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He coined the binomial name of &quot;Motacilla modularis&quot;. The specific epithet is from the Latin &quot;modularis&quot; &quot;modulating&quot; or &quot;singing&quot;. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Prunella&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816.

The name &quot;dunnock&quot; comes from the English &quot;dun&quot; (dingy brown, dark-coloured) and the diminutive &quot;ock&quot; (thus, the original &quot;little brown bird&quot;), while &quot;accentor&quot; is from post-classical Latin and means a person who sings with another. The genus name &quot;Prunella&quot; is from the German &quot;Braunelle&quot;, &quot;dunnock&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;braun&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;.

Seven subspecies are accepted by the IOC list:
* &quot;P. m. hebridium&quot; Meinertzhagen, R, 1934 – Ireland and the Hebrides (west of Scotland)
* &quot;P. m. occidentalis&quot; (Hartert, 1910) – Scotland (except the Hebrides), England, Wales and west France
* &quot;P. m. modularis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – north and central, and southeast Europe (including the formerly accepted &quot;P. m. meinertzhageni&quot; of the Balkans)
* &quot;P. m. fuscata&quot; Mauersberger, 1971 – south Crimean Peninsula (north coast of the Black Sea)
* &quot;P. m. euxina&quot; Watson, 1961 – northwest and north Turkey
* &quot;P. m. mabbotti&quot; Harper, 1919 – Iberian Peninsula, south-central France and Italy
* &quot;P. m. obscura&quot; (Hablizl, 1783) – northeast Turkey, Caucasus and north Iran
Acceptance of these seven subspecies has not been universal; Shirihai &amp; Svensson (2018) accept only three subspecies, &quot;P. m. occidentalis&quot; (including &quot;P. m. hebridium&quot;), &quot;P. m. modularis&quot; (including &quot;P. m. euxina, P. m. mabbotti&quot;), and &quot;P. m. obscura&quot; (including &quot;P. m. fuscata&quot;). Another study however recently suggested that dunnock might be better treated as three species, with &quot;P. m. mabbotti&quot; and &quot;P. m. obscura&quot; being elevated from subspecies status to separate species.

==Description==
A robin-sized bird, the dunnock typically measures in length. It has a brown back streaked blackish, somewhat resembling a small house sparrow. Like that species, the dunnock has a drab appearance which may have evolved as camouflage to avoid predation. It is brownish underneath, and has a fine pointed bill. Adults have a dull grey head, and both sexes are similarly coloured; juveniles are browner on the head, looser, &#x27;fluffy&#x27; feathering, and more obviously streaked overall.
Unlike any similar sized small brown bird in Europe, dunnocks exhibit frequent wing flicking, especially when engaged in territorial disputes or when competing for mating rights. This gave rise to the old nickname of &quot;shufflewing&quot;.

The main call of the dunnock is a shrill, persistent &quot;tseep&quot; along with a short, weak trilling note, which betrays the bird&#x27;s otherwise inconspicuous presence. The song is rapid, thin and tinkling, a sweet warble.

==Distribution and habitat==

Dunnocks are native to large areas of Eurasia, inhabiting much of Europe and southwest Asia including Lebanon, northern Iran, and the Caucasus. It is the only accentor commonly found in temperate lowland areas; the others all inhabit upland areas, or (Siberian accentor) subarctic lowlands. Favoured habitats include woodlands, shrubs, gardens, and hedgerows where they typically feed on the ground, often seeking out detritivores as food.

Dunnocks were successfully introduced into New Zealand during the 19th century, and are now widely distributed around the country and some offshore islands.

==Territoriality==

Dunnocks are territorial and may engage in conflict with other birds that encroach upon their nests. Males sometimes share a territory and exhibit a strict dominance hierarchy. Nevertheless, this social dominance is not translated into benefits to the alpha male in terms of reproduction, since paternity is usually equally shared between males of the group. Furthermore, members of a group are rarely related, and so competition can result.

Female territorial ranges are almost always exclusive. However, sometimes, multiple males will co-operate to defend a single territory containing multiple females. Males exhibit a strong dominance hierarchy within groups: older birds tend to be the dominant males and first-year birds are usually sub-dominant. Studies have found that close male relatives almost never share a territory.

The male&#x27;s ability to access females generally depends on female range size, which is affected by the distribution of food. When resources are distributed in dense patches, female ranges tend to be small and easy for males to monopolise. Subsequent mating systems, as discussed below, reflect high reproductive success for males and relatively lower success for females. In times of scarcity, female territories expand to accommodate the lack of resources, causing males to have a more difficult time monopolising females. Hence, females gain a reproductive advantage over males in this case.

==Breeding==
===Mating systems===
The dunnock possesses variable mating systems. Females are often polyandrous, breeding with two or more males at once, which is quite rare among birds. This multiple mating system leads to the development of sperm competition amongst the male suitors. DNA fingerprinting has shown that chicks within a brood often have different fathers, depending on the success of the males at monopolising the female. Males try to ensure their paternity by pecking at the cloaca of the female to stimulate ejection of rival males&#x27; sperm. Dunnocks take just one-tenth of a second to copulate and can mate more than 100 times a day. Males provide parental care in proportion to their mating success, so two males and a female can commonly be seen provisioning nestlings at one nest.

Other mating systems also exist within dunnock populations, depending on the ratio of male to females and the overlap of territories. When only one female and one male territory overlap, monogamy is preferred. Sometimes, two or three adjacent female territories overlap one male territory, and so polygyny is favoured, with the male monopolising several females. Polygynandry also exists, in which two males jointly defend a territory containing several females. Polyandry, though, is the most common mating system of dunnocks found in nature. Depending on the population, males generally have the best reproductive success in polygynous populations, while females have the advantage during polyandry.

Studies have illustrated the fluidity of dunnock mating systems. When given food in abundance, female territory size is reduced drastically. Consequently, males can more easily monopolise the females. Thus, the mating system can be shifted from one that favours female success (polyandry), to one that promotes male success (monogamy, polygynandry, or polygyny).

===Nest===
The dunnock builds a nest (predominantly from twigs and moss and lined with soft materials such as wool or feathers), low in a bush or conifer, where adults typically lay three to five unspotted blue eggs.

===Parental care and provisioning===
Broods, depending on the population, can be raised by a lone female, multiple females with the part-time help of a male, multiple females with full-time help by a male, or by multiple females and multiple males. In pairs, the male and the female invest parental care at similar rates. However, in trios, the female and alpha male invest more care in chicks than does the beta male. In territories in which females are able to escape from males, both the alpha and beta males share provisioning equally. This last system represents the best case scenario for females, as it helps to ensure maximal care and the success of the young.

A study has found that males tend to not discriminate between their own young and those of another male in polyandrous or polygynandrous systems. However, they do vary their feeding depending on the certainty of paternity. If a male has greater access to a female, and therefore a higher chance of a successful fertilisation, during a specific mating period, it would provide more care towards the young.

<text>Hopewell Holdings Limited () is a major property developer in Hong Kong established in 1972 and headed by Sir Gordon Wu.

==History==
Hopewell Holdings was established on 17 October 1972. It was listed on the Hong Kong stock exchanges in 1972 and delisted when taken private in 2019.

Hopewell Holding is a holding company for investments in infrastructure projects, property letting, property agency and management, hotel operations and management, restaurant operation and food catering, construction and project management.

Its primary businesses are in Guangdong and Hong Kong. It was one of the first foreign companies to invest in infrastructure projects in China and a pioneer of infrastructure developments across Asia, including the failed Bangkok Elevated Road and Train System (BERTS) project in Bangkok.

It held 68 percent of Hopewell Highway Infrastructure Ltd, which is spun off by Hopewell Holdings and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in early August, 2003. The company was sold off to Shenzhen Expressway Corporation Limited on 11 January 2022 and renamed Shenzhen Investment Holdings Bay Area Development Company Limited. 

As one of the founders of Hopewell Holdings, Wu has been the managing director since 1972. He retired as the managing director of Hopewell Holdings in January 2002 but remains as chairman of the board.

Hopewell participated in the investment of five toll road projects with a total length of , all of which being in the Pearl River Delta region of Guangdong province in mainland China. Four toll road projects are in operation while construction of the Phase I of the Guangzhou-Zhuhai West Superhighway (Guangzhou to Shunde section) commenced in December 2001. All of the projects are in the form of co-operative joint ventures between Hopewell and mainland Chinese partners.

* Guangzhou East-South-West Ring Road
* Shunde Roads
* Shunde 105 Roads
* Guangzhou-Zhuhai West Superhighway

==Thailand litigation==
Hopewell was the lead contractor for the ill-fated Bangkok Elevated Road and Train System. The project commenced in 1990 and was terminated by the Thai government in 1998, only 13% complete. Each side blamed the other for the failure of the project. Both parties sued, and the case has been in litigation since its cancellation. On 23 April 2019, Thailand&#x27;s Supreme Administrative Court upheld an arbitration committee&#x27;s ruling in favour of Hopewell, contractor for the 80 billion baht project. The court ordered SRT to pay Hopewell compensation of 11.88 billion baht, plus 7.5% interest per year. The interest, totaling 13 billion baht, brings the total to nearly 25 billion baht (c. US$400 million), payable within 180 days. Thailand&#x27;s Transport Ministry is battling to overturn the court ruling. &quot;We have found the contract should have been nullified from the very beginning, which means the government is not bound to pay a single baht in compensation,&quot; said a ministry spokesman.

<doc id="333114" wikidata="Q260654" url="?curid=333114" title="Joan of Arcadia">
<text>Joan of Arcadia is an American fantasy family drama television series telling the story of teenager Joan Girardi (Amber Tamblyn), who sees and speaks with God and performs tasks she is given. The series originally aired on Fridays on CBS for two seasons, from September 26, 2003, to April 22, 2005.

The show was praised by critics and won the Humanitas Prize and the People&#x27;s Choice Award. It was also nominated for an Emmy Award in its first season for Outstanding Drama Series. The title alludes to Joan of Arc and the show takes place in a fictionalized version of the town Arcadia, Maryland.

== Premise ==
Joan Girardi is a 16-year-old teenager living in the town of Arcadia in Maryland. She is the middle child of her family which includes elder brother Kevin, a former jock who has been left a paraplegic after a car accident, and younger brother Luke, a brainy nerd. Joan&#x27;s father Will is the town&#x27;s police chief. In the pilot episode, God appears to Joan and reminds her that she promised to do anything he wanted if he would let Kevin survive the car crash. He appears to Joan in the form of various people including small children, teenage boys, elderly ladies, transients, or passersby. Joan is asked by God to perform tasks that often appear to be trivial or inconsequential—such as enrolling in an AP Chemistry class or building a boat—but always end up positively improving a larger situation.

These plot lines are interwoven with more realistic matters, such as the relationships within the Girardi family. Various storylines that spanned multiple episodes dealt with the consequences of Kevin&#x27;s accident, Will&#x27;s job as a police officer, mother Helen&#x27;s career as an art teacher, and Luke&#x27;s aspirations to be a scientist.

=== Characterization of God ===
God is portrayed with a very human personality, and does not appear to favor any one particular religion, saying there are &quot;different ways to share the same truth.&quot; He quotes Bob Dylan, Emily Dickinson and the Beatles rather than any scripture or verses. The series examines God from a more metaphysical standpoint instead of a religious perspective.

God is also depicted as having a sharp sense of humor. In the episode &quot;Touch Move&quot;, He tells Joan that He has to send her &quot;down there&quot;. When Joan is worried He means Hell, He laughs and clarifies He meant the school basement. In another instance, She appears in the form of a woman exercising and says, &quot;Why do people always try and discern my deeper meanings? This is the kind of thinking that starts wars.&quot;

== Cast and characters ==
=== Main cast ===
* Joe Mantegna as Will Girardi, the father of Joan, Kevin, and Luke. He moved his family from their home in Chicago when he was offered the job of Chief of Police in Arcadia, Maryland. After he busts wide open the internal corruption of the town of Arcadia&#x27;s infrastructure, the Arcadia Police Department is disbanded and he becomes the Chief of Detectives of the Hogan County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, which assumed the law enforcement responsibilities for the town. After the departure of Lt. Preston, Will serves as the acting head of the HCSD Arcadia Station. He has one sister and a paternal half-brother, Richard (whom he is having bad terms with ever since they were young). Mantegna had a development deal with CBS and liked the script, so he agreed to be part of the show. He was also involved in the casting of the other characters.
* Mary Steenburgen as Helen Girardi, Will&#x27;s wife and mother of Kevin, Joan, Luke. An artist, Helen dropped out of art school after she was raped by an unknown perpetrator. She works as the secretary at Arcadia High School and becomes the art teacher in &quot;State of Grace&quot;. She was raised in the Catholic faith but was never confirmed; after moving to Arcadia, she has considered going back to the Church.
* Amber Tamblyn as Joan Girardi, the middle child of the Girardi family who talks to God. He often gives her assignments or tasks that eventually have a (usually) positive outcome, but she is frequently exasperated by the randomness of the directives and God&#x27;s refusal to answer any direct questions. She has an on-again, off-again romantic relationship with Adam Rove; the two break up in &quot;Trial and Error&quot;. As seen in &quot;Drive, He Said&quot;, Joan&#x27;s middle name is Agnes, and her date of birth is November 24, 1987. She works part-time as a retail associate at a local bookstore.
* Jason Ritter as Kevin Girardi, the eldest child in the Girardi family. A year and a half before the events of the pilot, he became a paraplegic in a car accident after failing to stop a friend from drunk driving.

== Theme song ==
The opening credits roll with the song &quot;One of Us&quot; written by Eric Bazilian and performed by Joan Osborne. It was a hit single for Osborne in the United States from her 1995 album &quot;Relish&quot;:
: &quot;What if God was one of us?&quot;
: &quot;Just a slob like one of us&quot;
: &quot;Just a stranger on the bus&quot;
: &quot;Trying to make his way home&quot; 
Osborne re-recorded the song specifically for the show. To fit the lyrics of the song, Joan first meets God as a teenage boy riding to school on the bus with her (although they don&#x27;t actually speak to each other at the time).

== Production ==

=== Development ===
The idea for &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; took shape during Barbara Hall’s time as a producer on &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; in the mid-1990s and evolved while she was an executive producer on CBS drama &quot;Judging Amy&quot;. Hall said &quot;the concept meshed her fascination with Joan of Arc...her longtime interest in physics and metaphysics, and her desire to use drama and comedy to explore the existence of God in a &#x27;scary, not benign universe.&#x27;&quot; Hall added, &quot;I started thinking, what would it look like if God tried to contact a teenager today? I made the decision that God would have to come to a teenage girl visually. Joan of Arc heard voices, but kids today aren’t going to hear voices because you’d have to get the iPods off their heads.”

When Hall pitched the series to CBS, she and executives agreed they were not looking to make another &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. Among the differences between the former show and &quot;Joan&quot; is that the character of Joan is not religious and &quot;the show’s tone is grittier.”

CBS greenlit the show in 2002 &quot;when public discourse about spirituality seemed more gentle: post-9/11 prayer services rather than heated debates over &quot;&#x27;The Passion of the Christ&quot;.&#x27;&quot; The acquisition was made as part of an effort by the network, which was known for its adult-skewing shows, to appeal to younger viewers. Hall developed the series with Hart Hanson and Jim Hayman, her &quot;Judging Amy&quot; production associates.

As a guideline for the series’ writing staff, Hall wrote a list of &quot;Ten Commandments of &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;&quot;, which enumerated what God can and cannot do in the show. These guidelines included points like, &quot;God can never identify one religion as being right,&quot; &quot;The job of every human being is to fulfill his or her true nature,&quot; &quot;God&#x27;s purpose for talking to Joan, and to everyone, is to get her (us) to recognize the interconnectedness of all things,&quot; and &quot;the exact nature of God is a mystery, and the mystery can never be solved.&quot;

=== Filming ===
Though Arcadia itself is set in Maryland, the series was mostly filmed at various Los Angeles locations. Establishing shots of Arcadia&#x27;s skyline and other outdoor scenes were filmed in the city of Wilmington, Delaware. Scenes at the fictional Arcadia High School were filmed at El Segundo High School in California.

== Episodes ==

=== Season 1 (2003–04) ===
=== Season 2 (2004–05) ===
== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics. On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has a rating of 92% based on 25 critics’ reviews, while Season 2 has a rating of 100% based on 5 reviews.

Greg Braxton of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said &quot;the series is a veritable squeezebox of genres...[including] a family drama, a coming-of-age saga of a teenager, a high school drama and a gritty police show, all tossed together with a mix of fantasy and religion.” Robert Lloyd, also of the &quot;LA Times&quot;, said &quot;the real miracle here is how deftly the show avoids the soggy cliches of redemption so many of its forerunners have embraced.&quot; Rob Owen of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; called it &quot;the best new broadcast series of the season,&quot; and the &quot;Associated Press&quot; said the show has an &quot;intelligent quirkiness.&quot;

James Poniewozik of &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;[The series&#x27;] marriage of the sacred and the mundane has made &quot;Arcadia&quot; the rare TV show about spirituality to win over both audiences and critics. Whereas its predecessors have been either panned but popular marshmallow halos (&quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;) or controversial, swiftly canceled critical darlings (&quot;Nothing Sacred&quot;), &quot;Arcadia&quot; has avoided, Goldilocks-style, going too soft or too hard.” He also noted that “by separating God from religion, &quot;Arcadia&quot; takes away what makes faith divisive—a reasonable goal for a major-network series that needs to draw a broad audience to thrive.&quot;

Melanie McFarland of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; said, &quot;Only a few episodes into its season, &quot;&#x27;Joan&quot;&#x27; has proved deserving of its growing reputation. It&#x27;s alive with everything television so desperately lacks: genuine heart, wit devoid of crassness, dramatic situations mirroring so many of our realities that the Girardis sometimes feel more like neighbors than a television family.” Nancy Franklin of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; opined the show is &quot;both thought through and open-ended, and it should prove especially rewarding for those who think that belief has more to do with asking questions than with getting answers.&quot;

Criticism of the series focused on the police procedural plots involving Will Girardi, which many said did not tonally fit with the show. Devin Gordon of &quot;Newsweek&quot; said that the series&#x27; cop drama and its fantasy elements felt like “two shows stitched awkwardly together.&quot; Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said &quot;the premiere suggests viewers are being asked to wade heart-deep into a drearily portentous muddle.”

Though critics were divided about the show&#x27;s tone and plot elements, there was across the board praise for Amber Tamblyn. Poniewozik wrote, &quot;If God, however, is simply asking Joan to do what all teens have to do—develop an identity—&quot;Arcadia&quot; works because Tamblyn reminds us so well how tough that job is. Joan may talk to God, but she has to do the work her own, mortal self, from accepting life&#x27;s unfairness to finding her niche at school...Unlike most prime-time teens, Joan is neither a babe nor a brain, neither a Goody Two-Shoes nor a sarcastic rebel. She&#x27;s the most extraordinarily average teen to crop up on a TV show in years—yet after a few episodes, you realize you would watch her story even if God stopped showing up.” Praise was also given for Mary Steenburgen and Jason Ritter, the latter of whom Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote, &quot;Indeed, the often painfully realistic treatment of the familial anguish that swirls around Kevin (Ritter), who lost the use of his legs in an auto accident, is one of the show&#x27;s greatest achievements.”

Critics have written retrospectively about the series. In 2015, Margaret Lyons of &quot;Vulture&quot; wrote, &quot;Somehow &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; is one of vanishingly few shows to bring up two extremely common questions that shape the human condition: &#x27;Is there a God?&#x27; and &#x27;Am I a good person?&#x27; The answer to both is, it depends whom you ask. And you can only ask so many people in two seasons.”

Writing for &quot;IndieWire&quot;, Alison Willmore said &quot;the show balanced [Joan&#x27;s] missions with the mistakes a well-meaning but impulsive high school girl might make, allowing the show to also be a very fine portrait of life at a certain age.&quot;

=== Nielsen ratings ===

&quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; debuted on the heels of &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, which had ended its nine-year run in April 2003. An estimated 12 million viewers tuned into the series premiere in September 2003. Though &quot;Joan&quot; was broadcast in the 8 p.m. time slot on Friday nights, a traditionally quiet night for TV, it became a modest hit for CBS and averaged 10.1 million viewers during its first season. The show regularly drew in young adult viewers for its time slot, which led to NBC changing the schedule for the competing comedy-drama series, &quot;Miss Match&quot;.

The following year, &quot;viewership sank to 8 million, according to Nielsen Media Research,&quot; despite continued critical acclaim which included three Emmy nominations. Partly at the request of the network, Barbara Hall introduced the character of Ryan, a menacing figure and amoral &quot;tempter&quot; (with The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; as his musical motif) seemingly destined to cause a significant amount of conflict for the show&#x27;s characters.

== Cancellation ==
While &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; was one of the highest-rated new shows of the 2003–2004 television season, its ratings declined in the second season and it was cancelled by CBS on May 18, 2005. Fan campaigns were created in response in an effort to have the show reinstated. A promotional campaign by CBS sent street teams into cities to do good deeds, such as buying a cold person a cup of coffee. Only two episodes from the second season, &quot;No Future&quot; and &quot;The Rise and Fall of Joan Girardi&quot;, were repeated by CBS, with remaining reruns pulled from the schedule. The cancellation meant the show ended on a cliffhanger, with the Ryan character potentially facing off against Joan. &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; took over the show&#x27;s Friday time slot in September 2005.

After the show&#x27;s cancellation, props such as pieces of Adam&#x27;s artwork and Joan&#x27;s signature messenger bag and costume pieces belonging to cast members were sold on eBay.

<text>The Eurasian treecreeper or common treecreeper (Certhia familiaris) is a small passerine bird also known in the British Isles, where it is the only living member of its genus, simply as treecreeper. It is similar to other treecreepers, and has a curved bill, patterned brown upperparts, whitish underparts, and long stiff tail feathers which help it creep up tree trunks. It can be most easily distinguished from the similar short-toed treecreeper, which shares much of its European range, by its different song.

The Eurasian treecreeper has nine or more subspecies which breed in different parts of its range in the Palearctic. This species is found in woodlands of all kinds, but where it overlaps with the short-toed treecreeper in western Europe it is more likely to be found in coniferous forests or at higher altitudes. It nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes, and favours introduced giant sequoia as nest sites where they are available. The female typically lays five or six pink-speckled white eggs in the lined nest, but eggs and chicks are vulnerable to attack by woodpeckers and mammals, including squirrels.

The Eurasian treecreeper is insectivorous and climbs up tree trunks like a mouse, to search for insects which it picks from crevices in the bark with its fine curved bill. It then flies to the base of another tree with a distinctive erratic flight. This bird is solitary in winter, but may form communal roosts in cold weather.

==Description==

Similar in appearance, all treecreepers are small birds with streaked and spotted brown upperparts, rufous rumps and whitish underparts. They have long decurved bills, and long rigid tail feathers that provide support as they creep up tree trunks looking for insects.

The Eurasian treecreeper is long and weighs 7.0–12.9 g (0.25–0.46 oz). It has warm brown upperparts intricately patterned with black, buff and white, and a plain brown tail. Its belly, flanks and vent area are tinged with buff. The sexes are similar, but the juvenile has duller upperparts than the adult, and its underparts are dull white with dark fine spotting on the flanks.

The contact call is a very quiet, thin and high-pitched &quot;sit&quot;, but the most distinctive call is a penetrating , with a vibrato quality, sometimes repeated as a series of notes. The male&#x27;s song begins with followed in turn by a few twittering notes, a longer descending ripple, and a whistle that falls and then rises.

The range of the Eurasian treecreeper overlaps with that of several other treecreepers, which can present local identification problems. In Europe, the Eurasian treecreeper shares much of its range with the short-toed treecreeper. Compared to that species, it is whiter below, warmer and more spotted above, and has a whiter supercilium and slightly shorter bill. Visual identification, even in the hand, may be impossible for poorly marked birds. A singing treecreeper is usually identifiable, since short-toed treecreeper has a distinctive series of evenly spaced notes sounding quite different from the song of Eurasian treecreeper; however, both species have been known to sing the other&#x27;s song.

Three Himalayan subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper are now sometimes given full species status as Hodgson&#x27;s treecreeper, for example by BirdLife International, but if they are retained as subspecies of Eurasian, they have to be distinguished from three other South Asian treecreepers. The plain tail of the Eurasian treecreeper differentiates it from the bar-tailed treecreeper, which has a distinctive barred tail pattern, and its white throat is an obvious difference from that of the brown-throated treecreeper. The rusty-flanked treecreeper is more difficult to separate from the Eurasian, but the former has more contrasting cinnamon, rather than buff, flanks.

The North American brown creeper has never been recorded in Europe, but an autumn vagrant would be difficult to identify, since it would not be singing, and the American species&#x27; call is much like that of Eurasian treecreeper. In appearance, the brown creeper is more like a short-toed treecreeper than a Eurasianone, but a vagrant might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.

==Taxonomy==

The Eurasian treecreeper was first described under its current scientific name in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The binomial name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;kerthios&quot;, a small tree-dwelling bird described by Aristotle and others, and Latin &quot;familiaris&quot;, familiar or common.

This species is one of a group of very similar typical treecreeper species, all placed in the single genus &quot;Certhia&quot;. Eight species are currently recognised, in two evolutionary lineages: a Holarctic radiation, and a southern Asian group. The Holarctic group has a more warbling song, always (except in &quot;C. familiaris&quot; from China) starting or ending with a shrill . Species in the southern group, in contrast, have a faster-paced trill without the sound. All the species have distinctive vocalizations and some subspecies have been elevated to species on the basis of their calls.

The Eurasian treecreeper belongs to the northern group, along with the North American brown creeper, &quot;C. americana&quot;, the short-toed treecreeper, &quot;C. brachydactyla&quot;, of western Eurasia, and, if it is considered a separate species, Hodgson&#x27;s treecreeper, &quot;C. hodgsoni&quot;, from the southern rim of the Himalayas.

The brown creeper has sometimes been considered to be a subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper, but has closer affinities to short-toed treecreeper, and is normally now treated as a full species. Hodgson&#x27;s treecreeper is a more recent proposed split following studies of its cytochrome &quot;b&quot; mtDNA sequence and song structure that indicate that it may well be a distinct species from &quot;C. familiaris&quot;.

There are nine to twelve subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper, depending on the taxonomic view taken, which are all very similar and often interbreed in areas where their ranges overlap. There is a general cline in appearance from west to east across Eurasia, with subspecies becoming greyer above and whiter below, but this trend reverses east of the Amur River. The currently recognised subspecies are as follows:

==Distribution and habitat==

The Eurasian treecreeper is the most widespread member of its genus, breeding in temperate woodlands across the Palearctic from Ireland to Japan. It prefers mature trees, and in most of Europe, where it shares its range with short-toed treecreeper, it tends to be found mainly in coniferous forest, especially spruce and fir. However, where it is the only treecreeper, as in European Russia, or the British Isles, it frequents broadleaved or mixed woodland in preference to conifers. It is also found in parks and large gardens.

The Eurasian treecreeper breeds down to sea level in the north of its range, but tends to be a highland species further south. In the Pyrenees it breeds above , in China from and in southern Japan from . The breeding areas have July isotherms between 14–16 °C and and 72–73 °F).

The Eurasian treecreeper is non-migratory in the milder west and south of its breeding range, but some northern birds move south in winter, and individuals breeding on mountains may descend to a lower altitude in winter. Winter movements and post-breeding dispersal may lead to vagrancy outside the normal range. Wintering migrants of the Asian subspecies have been recorded in South Korea and China, and the nominate form has been recorded west of its breeding range as far as Orkney, Scotland. The Eurasian treecreeper has also occurred as a vagrant to the Channel Islands (where the short-toed is the resident species), Majorca and the Faroe Islands.

==Ecology and behaviour==

===Breeding===
The Eurasian treecreeper breeds from the age of one year, nesting in tree crevices or behind bark flakes. Where present, the introduced North American giant sequoia is a favourite nesting tree, since a nest cavity can be easily hollowed out in its soft bark. Crevices in buildings or walls are sometimes used, and artificial nest boxes or flaps may be preferred in coniferous woodland. The nest has a base of twigs, pine needles, grass or bark, and a lining of finer material such as feathers, wool, moss, lichen or spider web.
In Europe, the typical clutch of five–six eggs is laid between March and June, but in Japan three–five eggs are laid from May to July. The eggs are white with very fine pinkish speckles mainly at the broad end, measure and weigh of which 6% is shell. The eggs are incubated by the female alone for 13–17 days until the altricial downy chicks hatch; they are then fed by both parents, but brooded by the female alone, for a further 15–17 days to fledging. Juveniles return to the nest for a few nights after fledging. About 20% of pairs, mainly in the south and west, raise a second brood.

Predators of treecreeper nests and young include the great spotted woodpecker, red squirrel, and small mustelids, and predation is about three times higher in fragmented landscapes than in solid blocks of woodland (32.4% against 12.0% in less fragmented woodlands). The predation rate increases with the amount of forest edge close to a nest site, and also the presence of nearby agricultural land, in both cases probably because of a higher degree of mustelid predation. This species is parasitised in the nest by the moorhen flea, &quot;Dasypsyllus gallinulae&quot;. The juvenile survival rate of this species is unknown, but 47.7% of adults survive each year. The typical lifespan is two years, but the maximum recorded age is eight years and ten months.

===Feeding===

The Eurasian treecreeper typically seeks invertebrate food on tree trunks, starting near the tree base and working its way up using its stiff tail feathers for support. Unlike a nuthatch, it does not come down trees head first, but flies to the base of another nearby tree. It uses its long thin bill to extract insects and spiders from crevices in the bark. Although normally found on trees, it will occasionally hunt prey items on walls, bare ground, or amongst fallen pine needles, and may add some conifer seeds to its diet in the colder months.

The female Eurasian treecreeper forages primarily on the upper parts of the tree trunks, while the male uses the lower parts. A study in Finland found that if a male disappears, the unpaired female will forage at lower heights, spend less time on each tree and have shorter foraging bouts than a paired female.

This bird may sometimes join mixed-species feeding flocks in winter, but it does not appear to share the resources found by accompanying tits and goldcrests, and may just be benefiting from the extra vigilance of a flock. Wood ants share the same habitat as the treecreeper, and also feed on invertebrates on tree trunks. The Finnish researchers found that where the ants have been foraging, there are fewer arthropods, and male treecreepers spent a shorter time on spruce trunks visited by ants.

===Habits===

As a small woodland bird with cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, it is not wary, and is largely indifferent to the presence of humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or night, but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to a dozen or more birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.

== Conservation status ==
This species has an extensive range of about 10 million km2 (3.8 million square miles). It has a large population, including an estimated 11–20 million individuals in Europe alone. Population trends have not been quantified, but the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.

It is common through much of its range, but in the northernmost areas it is rare, since it is vulnerable to hard winters, especially if its feeding is disrupted by an ice glaze on the trees or freezing rain. It is also uncommon in Turkey and the Caucasus. In the west of its range it has spread to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, pushed further north in Norway, and first bred in the Netherlands in 1993.

<text>Keratinocytes are the primary type of cell found in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. In humans, they constitute 90% of epidermal skin cells. Basal cells in the basal layer (&quot;stratum basale&quot;) of the skin are sometimes referred to as basal keratinocytes.
Keratinocytes form a barrier against environmental damage by heat, UV radiation, water loss, pathogenic bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses.
A number of structural proteins, enzymes, lipids, and antimicrobial peptides contribute to maintain the important barrier function of the skin.
Keratinocytes differentiate from epidermal stem cells in the lower part of the epidermis and migrate towards the surface, finally becoming corneocytes and eventually being shed, which happens every 40 to 56 days in humans.

==Function==
The primary function of keratinocytes is the formation of a barrier against environmental damage by heat, UV radiation, dehydration, pathogenic bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses.

Pathogens invading the upper layers of the epidermis can cause keratinocytes to produce proinflammatory mediators, particularly chemokines such as CXCL10 and CCL2 (MCP-1) which attract monocytes, natural killer cells, T-lymphocytes, and dendritic cells to the site of pathogen invasion.

==Structure==
A number of structural proteins (filaggrin, keratin), enzymes (e.g. proteases), lipids, and antimicrobial peptides (defensins) contribute to maintain the important barrier function of the skin. Keratinization is part of the physical barrier formation (cornification), in which the keratinocytes produce more and more keratin and undergo terminal differentiation. The fully cornified keratinocytes that form the outermost layer are constantly shed off and replaced by new cells.

==Cell differentiation==
Epidermal stem cells reside in the lower part of the epidermis (stratum basale) and are attached to the basement membrane through hemidesmosomes. Epidermal stem cells divide in a random manner yielding either more stem cells or transit amplifying cells. Some of the transit amplifying cells continue to proliferate then commit to differentiate and migrate towards the surface of the epidermis. Those stem cells and their differentiated progeny are organized into columns named epidermal proliferation units.

During this differentiation process, keratinocytes permanently withdraw from the cell cycle, initiate expression of epidermal differentiation markers, and move suprabasally as they become part of the stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and eventually corneocytes in the stratum corneum.

Corneocytes are keratinocytes that have completed their differentiation program and have lost their nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles. Corneocytes will eventually be shed off through desquamation as new ones come in.

At each stage of differentiation, keratinocytes express specific keratins, such as keratin 1, keratin 5, keratin 10, and keratin 14, but also other markers such as involucrin, loricrin, transglutaminase, filaggrin, and caspase 14.

In humans, it is estimated that keratinocytes turn over from stem cells to desquamation every 40–56 days, whereas in mice the estimated turnover time is 8–10 days.

Factors promoting keratinocyte differentiation are:
* A calcium gradient, with the lowest concentration in the stratum basale and increasing concentrations until the outer stratum granulosum, where it reaches its maximum. Calcium concentration in the stratum corneum is very high in part because those relatively dry cells are not able to dissolve the ions. Those elevations of extracellular calcium concentrations induces an increase in intracellular free calcium concentrations in keratinocytes. Part of that intracellular calcium increase comes from calcium released from intracellular stores and another part comes from transmembrane calcium influx, through both calcium-sensitive chloride channels and voltage-independent cation channels permeable to calcium. Moreover, it has been suggested that an extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) also contributes to the rise in intracellular calcium concentration.
* Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) regulates keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation mostly by modulating calcium concentrations and regulating the expression of genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation. Keratinocytes are the only cells in the body with the entire vitamin D metabolic pathway from vitamin D production to catabolism and vitamin D receptor expression.
* Cathepsin E.
* TALE homeodomain transcription factors.
* Hydrocortisone.

Since keratinocyte differentiation inhibits keratinocyte proliferation, factors that promote keratinocyte proliferation should be considered as preventing differentiation. These factors include:
* The transcription factor p63, which prevents epidermal stem cells from differentiating into keratinocytes. Mutations in the p63 DNA-binding domain are associated with ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft lip/palate (EEC) syndrome. The transcriptome of p63 mutant keratinocytes deviated from the normal epidermal cell identity.
* Vitamin A and its analogues.
* Epidermal growth factor.
* Transforming growth factor alpha.
* Cholera toxin.

==Interaction with other cells==
Within the epidermis keratinocytes are associated with other cell types such as melanocytes and Langerhans cells. Keratinocytes form tight junctions with the nerves of the skin and hold the Langerhans cells and intra-dermal lymphocytes in position within the epidermis. Keratinocytes also modulate the immune system: apart from the above-mentioned antimicrobial peptides and chemokines they are also potent producers of anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10 and TGF-β. When activated, they can stimulate cutaneous inflammation and Langerhans cell activation via TNFα and IL-1β secretion.

Keratinocytes contribute to protecting the body from ultraviolet radiation (UVR) by taking up melanosomes, vesicles containing the endogenous photoprotectant melanin, from epidermal melanocytes. Each melanocyte in the epidermis has several dendrites that stretch out to connect it with many keratinocytes. The melanin is then stored within keratinocytes and melanocytes in the perinuclear area as supranuclear &quot;caps&quot;, where it protects the DNA from UVR-induced damage.

==Role in wound healing==
Wounds to the skin will be repaired in part by the migration of keratinocytes to fill in the gap created by the wound. The first set of keratinocytes to participate in that repair come from the bulge region of the hair follicle and will only survive transiently. Within the healed epidermis they will be replaced by keratinocytes originating from the epidermis.

At the opposite, epidermal keratinocytes, can contribute to &quot;de novo&quot; hair follicle formation during the healing of large wounds.

Functional keratinocytes are needed for tympanic perforation healing.

==Sunburn cells==
A sunburn cell is a keratinocyte with a pyknotic nucleus and eosinophilic cytoplasm that appears after exposure to UVC or UVB radiation or UVA in the presence of psoralens. It shows premature and abnormal keratinization, and has been described as an example of apoptosis.

==Aging==

With age, tissue homeostasis declines partly because stem/progenitor cells fail to self-renew or differentiate. DNA damage caused by exposure of stem/progenitor cells to reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play a key role in epidermal stem cell aging. Mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) ordinarily protects against ROS. Loss of SOD2 in mouse epidermal cells was observed to cause cellular senescence that irreversibly arrested proliferation in a fraction of keratinocytes. In older mice, SOD2 deficiency delayed wound closure and reduced epidermal thickness.

==Civatte body==

A Civatte body (named after the French dermatologist Achille Civatte, 1877–1956) is a damaged basal keratinocyte that has undergone apoptosis, and consist largely of keratin intermediate filaments, and are almost invariably covered with immunoglobulins, mainly IgM. Civatte bodies are characteristically found in skin lesions of various dermatoses, particularly lichen planus and discoid lupus erythematosus. They may also be found in graft-versus-host disease, adverse drug reactions, inflammatory keratosis (such as lichenoid actinic keratosis and lichen planus-like keratosis), erythema multiforme, bullous pemphigoid, eczema, lichen planopilaris, febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, herpes simplex and varicella zoster lesions, dermatitis herpetiformis, porphyria cutanea tarda, sarcoidosis, subcorneal pustular dermatosis, transient acantholytic dermatosis and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.

<text>The epidermis is the outermost of the three layers that comprise the skin, the inner layers being the dermis and hypodermis. The epidermal layer provides a barrier to infection from environmental pathogens and regulates the amount of water released from the body into the atmosphere through transepidermal water loss.

The epidermis is composed of multiple layers of flattened cells that overlie a base layer (stratum basale) composed of columnar cells arranged perpendicularly. The layers of cells develop from stem cells in the basal layer. The thickness of the epidermis varies from 31.2μm for the penis to 596.6μm for the sole of the foot with most being roughly 90μm. Thickness does not vary between the sexes but becomes thinner with age. The human epidermis is an example of epithelium, particularly a stratified squamous epithelium.

The word epidermis is derived through Latin , itself and . Something related to or part of the epidermis is termed epidermal.

== Structure ==

===Cellular components===
The epidermis primarily consists of keratinocytes (proliferating basal and differentiated suprabasal), which comprise 90% of its cells, but also contains melanocytes, Langerhans cells, Merkel cells, and inflammatory cells. Epidermal thickenings called Rete ridges (or rete pegs) extend downward between dermal papillae. Blood capillaries are found beneath the epidermis, and are linked to an arteriole and a venule.
The epidermis itself has no blood supply and is nourished almost exclusively by diffused oxygen from the surrounding air. Cellular mechanisms for regulating water and sodium levels (ENaCs) are found in all layers of the epidermis.

===Cell boundaries===
Epidermal cells are tightly interconnected to serve as a tight barrier against the exterior environment. The junctions between the epidermal cells are of the adherens junction type, formed by transmembrane proteins called cadherins. Inside the cell, the cadherins are linked to actin filaments. In immunofluorescence microscopy, the actin filament network appears as a thick border surrounding the cells, although the actin filaments are actually located inside the cell and run parallel to the cell membrane. Because of the proximity of the neighboring cells and tightness of the junctions, the actin immunofluorescence appears as a border between cells.

===Layers===

The epidermis is composed of four or five layers, depending on the skin region. Those layers from outermost to innermost are:
; cornified layer (&quot;stratum corneum&quot;): Composed of 10 to 30 layers of polyhedral, anucleated corneocytes (final step of keratinocyte differentiation), with the palms and soles having the most layers. Corneocytes contain a protein envelope (cornified envelope proteins) underneath the plasma membrane, are filled with water-retaining keratin proteins, attached together through corneodesmosomes and surrounded in the extracellular space by stacked layers of lipids. Most of the barrier functions of the epidermis localize to this layer.
; clear/translucent layer (&quot;stratum lucidum&quot;, only in palms and soles): This narrow layer is found only on the palms and soles. The epidermis of these two areas is known as &quot;thick skin&quot; because with this extra layer, the skin has 5 epidermal layers instead of 4.
; granular layer (&quot;stratum granulosum&quot;): Keratinocytes lose their nuclei and their cytoplasm appears granular. Lipids, contained into those keratinocytes within lamellar bodies, are released into the extracellular space through exocytosis to form a lipid barrier that prevents water loss from the body as well as entry of foreign substances. Those polar lipids are then converted into non-polar lipids and arranged parallel to the cell surface. For example glycosphingolipids become ceramides and phospholipids become free fatty acids.
; spinous layer (&quot;stratum spinosum&quot;): Keratinocytes become connected through desmosomes and produce lamellar bodies, from within the Golgi, enriched in polar lipids, glycosphingolipids, free sterols, phospholipids and catabolic enzymes. Langerhans cells, immunologically active cells, are located in the middle of this layer.
; basal/germinal layer (&quot;stratum basale/germinativum&quot;): Composed mainly of proliferating and non-proliferating keratinocytes, attached to the basement membrane by hemidesmosomes. Melanocytes are present, connected to numerous keratinocytes in this and other strata through dendrites. Merkel cells are also found in the stratum basale with large numbers in touch-sensitive sites such as the fingertips and lips. They are closely associated with cutaneous nerves and seem to be involved in light touch sensation.
; Malpighian layer (&quot;stratum malpighii&quot;): This is usually defined as both the stratum basale and stratum spinosum.

The epidermis is separated from the dermis, its underlying tissue, by a basement membrane.

===Cellular kinetics===

====Cell division====
As a stratified squamous epithelium, the epidermis is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale. Differentiating cells delaminate from the basement membrane and are displaced outward through the epidermal layers, undergoing multiple stages of differentiation until, in the stratum corneum, losing their nucleus and fusing to squamous sheets, which are eventually shed from the surface (desquamation). Differentiated keratinocytes secrete keratin proteins, which contribute to the formation of an extracellular matrix that is an integral part of the skin barrier function. In normal skin, the rate of keratinocyte production equals the rate of loss, taking about two weeks for a cell to journey from the stratum basale to the top of the stratum granulosum, and an additional four weeks to cross the stratum corneum. The entire epidermis is replaced by new cell growth over a period of about 48 days.

====Calcium concentration====
Keratinocyte differentiation throughout the epidermis is in part mediated by a calcium gradient, increasing from the stratum basale until the outer stratum granulosum, where it reaches its maximum, and decreasing in the stratum corneum. Calcium concentration in the stratum corneum is very low in part because those relatively dry cells are not able to dissolve the ions. This calcium gradient parallels keratinocyte differentiation and as such is considered a key regulator in the formation of the epidermal layers.

Elevation of extracellular calcium concentrations induces an increase in intracellular free calcium concentrations. Part of that intracellular increase comes from calcium released from intracellular stores and another part comes from transmembrane calcium influx, through both calcium-sensitive chloride channels and voltage-independent cation channels permeable to calcium. Moreover, it has been suggested that an extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) also contributes to the rise in intracellular calcium concentration.

===Development===
Epidermal organogenesis, the formation of the epidermis, begins in the cells covering the embryo after neurulation, the formation of the central nervous system. In most vertebrates, this original one-layered structure quickly transforms into a two-layered tissue; a temporary outer layer, the embryonic &quot;periderm&quot;, which is disposed once the inner basal layer or &quot;stratum germinativum&quot; has formed.

This inner layer is a germinal epithelium that gives rise to all epidermal cells. It divides to form the outer spinous layer (&quot;stratum spinosum&quot;). The cells of these two layers, together called the Malpighian layer(s) after Marcello Malpighi, divide to form the superficial granular layer (&quot;Stratum granulosum&quot;) of the epidermis.

The cells in the stratum granulosum do not divide, but instead form skin cells called keratinocytes from the granules of keratin. These skin cells finally become the cornified layer (&quot;stratum corneum&quot;), the outermost epidermal layer, where the cells become flattened sacks with their nuclei located at one end of the cell. After birth these outermost cells are replaced by new cells from the stratum granulosum and throughout life they are shed at a rate of 30 - 90 milligrams of skin flakes every hour, or 0.720 - 2.16 grams per day.

Epidermal development is a product of several growth factors, two of which are:
* Transforming growth factor Alpha (TGFα) is an autocrine growth factor by which basal cells stimulate their own division.
* Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF or FGF7) is a paracrine growth factor produced by the underlying dermal fibroblasts in which the proliferation of basal cells is regulated.

== Function ==

===Barrier===
The epidermis serves as a barrier to protect the body against microbial pathogens, oxidant stress (UV light), and chemical compounds, and provides mechanical resistance to minor injury. Most of this barrier role is played by the stratum corneum.

;Characteristics
* Physical barrier: Epidermal keratinocytes are tightly linked by cell–cell junctions associated to cytoskeletal proteins, giving the epidermis its mechanical strength.
* Chemical barrier: Highly organized lipids, acids, hydrolytic enzymes, and antimicrobial peptides inhibit passage of external chemicals and pathogens into the body.
* Immunologically active barrier: The humoral and cellular constituents of the immune system found in the epidermis actively combat infection.
* Water content of the stratum corneum drops towards the surface, creating hostile conditions for pathogenic microorganism growth.
* An acidic pH (around 5.0) and low amounts of water make the epidermis hostile to many microorganic pathogens.
* Non-pathogenic microorganisms on the surface of the epidermis help defend against pathogens by competing for food, limiting its availability, and producing chemical secretions that inhibit the growth of pathogenic microbiota.

;Permeability
* Psychological stress, through an increase in glucocorticoids, compromises the stratum corneum and thus the barrier function.
* Sudden and large shifts in humidity alter stratum corneum hydration in a way that could allow entry of pathogenic microorganisms.

The ability of the skin to hold water is primarily due to the stratum corneum and is critical for maintaining healthy skin. Skin hydration is quantified using corneometry. Lipids arranged through a gradient and in an organized manner between the cells of the stratum corneum form a barrier to transepidermal water loss.

===Skin color===
The amount and distribution of melanin pigment in the epidermis is the main reason for variation in skin color in &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Melanin is found in the small melanosomes, particles formed in melanocytes from where they are transferred to the surrounding keratinocytes. The size, number, and arrangement of the melanosomes vary between racial groups, but while the number of melanocytes can vary between different body regions, their numbers remain the same in individual body regions in all human beings. In white and Asian skin the melanosomes are packed in &quot;aggregates&quot;, but in black skin they are larger and distributed more evenly. The number of melanosomes in the keratinocytes increases with UV radiation exposure, while their distribution remain largely unaffected.

===Touch===
The skin contains specialized epidermal touch receptor cells called Merkel cells. Historically, the role of Merkel cells in sensing touch has been thought to be indirect, due their close association with nerve endings. However, recent work in mice and other model organisms demonstrates that Merkel cells intrinsically transform touch into electrical signals that are transmitted to the nervous system.

==Clinical significance==
Laboratory culture of keratinocytes to form a 3D structure (artificial skin) recapitulating most of the properties of the epidermis is routinely used as a tool for drug development and testing.

===Hyperplasia===
Epidermal hyperplasia (thickening resulting from cell proliferation) has various forms:
* Acanthosis is diffuse epidermal hyperplasia (thickening of the skin, and not to be confused with acanthocytes). It implies increased thickness of the Malpighian layer (stratum basale and stratum spinosum). Acanthosis nigricans is a black, poorly defined, velvety hyperpigmented acanthosis, usually observed in the back of neck, axilla, and other folded regions of the skin.
* Focal epithelial hyperplasia (Heck&#x27;s disease) is an asymptomatic, benign neoplastic condition characterized by multiple white to pinkish papules that occur diffusely in the oral cavity.
* Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia (PEH) is a benign condition characterized by hyperplasia of the epidermis and epithelium of skin appendages, with irregular squamous strands extending down into the dermis, and closely simulating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
In contrast, hyperkeratosis is a thickening of the stratum corneum, and is not necessarily due to hyperplasia.

<text>The short-toed treecreeper (Certhia brachydactyla) is a small passerine bird found in woodlands through much of the warmer regions of Europe and into north Africa. It has a generally more southerly distribution than the other European treecreeper species, the common treecreeper, with which it is easily confused where they both occur. The short-toed treecreeper tends to prefer deciduous trees and lower altitudes than its relative in these overlap areas. Although mainly sedentary, vagrants have occurred outside the breeding range.

The short-toed treecreeper is one of a group of four very similar Holarctic treecreepers, including the closely related North American brown creepers, and has five subspecies differing in appearance and song. Like other treecreepers, the short-toed is inconspicuously plumaged brown above and whitish below, and has a curved bill and stiff tail feathers. It is a resident in woodlands throughout its range, and nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes, laying about six eggs. This common, unwary, but inconspicuous species feeds mainly on insects which are picked from the tree trunk as the treecreeper ascends with short hops.

==Taxonomy==
The short-toed treecreeper was first described by Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1820. The binomial name is derived from Greek; &quot;kerthios&quot; is a small tree-dwelling bird described by Aristotle and others, and &quot;brachydactyla&quot; comes from &quot;brakhus&quot;, &quot;short&quot; and &quot;dactulos&quot; &quot;finger&quot;, which refers, like the English name, to the fact that this species has shorter toes than the common treecreeper.

This species is one of a group of very similar treecreeper species, all placed in the single genus &quot;Certhia&quot;. Eight species are currently recognised, in two evolutionary lineages, a Holarctic radiation, and a Sino-Himalayan group south and east of the Himalayas. The former group has a more warbling song, always (except in &quot;C. familiaris&quot; from China) starting or ending with a shrill &quot;sreeh&quot;. The Himalayan species, in contrast, have a faster-paced trill without the &quot;sreeh&quot; sound. The short-toed treecreeper belongs to the northern group, along with the North American brown creeper, &quot;C. americana&quot;, the common treecreeper, &quot;C. familaris&quot;, of temperate Eurasia, and Hodgson&#x27;s treecreeper, &quot;C. hodgsoni&quot;, from the southern rim of the Himalayas.

===Subspecies===
There are five subspecies of short-toed treecreeper, which are all very similar and often intergrade in areas where their ranges overlap. There is a general cline in appearance from west to east across Europe, with upperparts becoming a darker and colder brown. The currently recognised subspecies are as follows:
==Description==
All the treecreepers are similar in appearance, being small birds with streaked and spotted brown upperparts, rufous rumps and whitish underparts. They have long decurved bills, and long stiff tail feathers which provide support as they creep up tree trunks looking for insects.

The short-toed treecreeper is long and weighs . It has dull grey-brown upperparts intricately patterned with black, buff and white, a weak off-white supercilium and dingy underparts contrasting with the white throat. The sexes are similar, but juveniles have whitish underparts, sometimes with a buff belly.

The call of this species is a repeated shrill &quot;tyt...tyt tyt-tyt&quot; and the song of the nominate subspecies is an evenly spaced sequence of notes &quot;teet-teet-teet-e-roi-tiit&quot;. There is some geographical variation; the song of Danish birds is shorter, that of the Cyprus subspecies is very short and simple, and the North African version is lower pitched. European birds do not respond to latter two song variants.

This species shares much of its range with the common treecreeper. Compared to the short-toed, that bird is whiter below, warmer and more spotted above, and has a whiter supercilium and slightly shorter bill. However, identification by sight may be impossible for poorly-marked birds. Vocal birds are usually identifiable, since Common has a distinctive song composed of twitters, ripples and a final whistle and a &quot;shree&quot;&#x27; call rarely given by the short-toed; however, both species have been known to sing the other&#x27;s song. Even in the hand, although the short-toed usually has a longer bill and shorter toes, 5% of birds are not safely identifiable.

The brown treecreeper has never been recorded in Europe, but would be difficult to separate from the short-toed treecreeper, which it much resembles in appearance. Its call is more like the common treecreeper&#x27;s, but a vagrant brown treecreeper might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.

==Distribution and habitat==

The short-toed treecreeper breeds in temperate woodlands across Europe from Portugal to Turkey and Greece, and in north west Africa. It prefers well-grown trees, especially oak and avoids pure stands of conifers. Where it shares its European range with common treecreeper, the latter species tends to be found mainly in coniferous forest and at higher altitudes.

It is usually found in the lowlands, but breeds locally at up to in Germany, in France and in Switzerland. In Turkey and North Africa it is a mountain species. The breeding areas have July isotherms between 17–18 °C and 26 °C (63–64 °F and 79 °F).

This treecreeper is essentially non-migratory but post-breeding dispersal may lead to vagrancy outside the normal range. It has occurred as a vagrant to England, Sweden, Lithuania and the Balearic Islands. Three birds on Corsica in 1969 appeared to be of the North African subspecies &quot;C. b. mauritanica&quot;.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===
The short-toed nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes. Old woodpecker nests, crevices in buildings or walls, and artificial nest boxes or flaps are also used.

The nest has an often bulky base of twigs, pine needles, grass or bark, and a lining of finer material such as feathers, wool, moss, lichen or spider web. The eggs are laid between April and mid June (typical clutch 5–7 eggs); they are white with purple-red blotches, in size. The eggs are incubated by the female alone for 13 – 15 days until the altricial downy chicks hatch; they are then fed by both parents, but brooded by the female alone, for a further 15 – 18 days to fledging. This species often raises a second brood. The male starts constructing a new nest while the female is still feeding the first brood, and when the chicks are 10–12 days old, he takes over feeding duties while the female completes the new nest.

A Spanish study suggests that forest fragmentation adversely affects the numbers of short-toed treecreepers present, as is also the case with the common treecreeper. Species that depend on relatively scarce resources, such as tree trunks, only occupy the larger forests, whereas those such as tits and common firecrests that exploit abundant, ubiquitous resources are distributed uniformly through woodlands of all sizes.

===Feeding===
The short-toed treecreeper typically seeks invertebrate food on tree trunks, starting near the tree base and spiralling its way up using its stiff tail feathers for support. Unlike a nuthatch, it does not come down trees head first, but flies to the base of another nearby tree. It uses its long thin bill to extract insects and spiders from crevices in the bark. Although normally found on trees, it will occasionally feed on walls or bare ground, or amongst fallen pine needles. It may add some seeds to its diet in the colder months.

===Habits===
As a small woodland bird with cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the short-toed treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, it is not wary, and is largely indifferent to the presence of humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to twenty or more birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice, or in a star formation under eaves of buildings.

==Status and conservation==
This species has an extensive range of between 1–10 million square kilometres (0.4–3.8 million square mi). It has a large population, estimated at between 4.1–14 million individuals. Population trends have not been quantified, but the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the short-toed treecreeper is evaluated as Least Concern.

It is common through much of its range, but is rare in the Caucasus and on the smaller Channel Islands. In the west of its range it is spreading north through Denmark, where it first bred in 1946.
