<text>Vergina (, ) is a small town in Northern Greece, part of the Veria municipality in Imathia, Central Macedonia. Vergina was established in 1922 in the aftermath of the population exchanges after the Treaty of Lausanne and was a separate municipality until 2011, when it was merged with Veroia under the Kallikratis Plan.

Vergina is best known as the site of ancient [[Aegae (Macedonia)|Aigai]] (, , Latinized: &quot;Aegae&quot;), the first capital of Macedon. In 336 BC Philip II was assassinated in Aigai&#x27;s theatre and his son, Alexander the Great, was proclaimed king. While the resting place of Alexander the Great is unknown, researchers uncovered three tombs at Vergina in 1977 – referred to as tombs I, II and III. 

Tomb I contained Philip II, Alexander the Great&#x27;s father, tomb II belonged to Philip III of Macedon, Alexander the Great&#x27;s half-brother, while tomb III contained Alexander IV, Alexander the Great&#x27;s son.

Tomb I had been looted; Tombs II and III were intact and contained an array of burial goods. The ancient town was also the site of an extensive royal palace. The archaeological museum of Vergina was built to house all the artifacts found at the site and is one of the most important museums in Greece.

Aigai has been awarded UNESCO World Heritage Site status as &quot;an exceptional testimony to a significant development in European civilization, at the transition from classical city-state to the imperial structure of the Hellenistic and Roman periods&quot;.

==History==

The area within 7 km of the later city was occupied by villages forming an important population centre by 1000BC. This has been shown by archaeology since 1995. Aigai followed a similar development as other ancient Greek cities.

In the 7th century BC, the Temenids&#x27; dominance led to the Macedonians expanding and subduing local populations until the end of the 6th century BC, and establishing the dynasty at Aigai.

Ancient sources give conflicting accounts of the origins of the Argead dynasty. Alexander I is the first truly historic figure and, based on the line of succession, the beginnings of the Macedonian dynasty have been traditionally dated to 750 BC. Herodotus says that the Argead dynasty was an ancient Greek royal house led by Perdiccas I who fled from Argos in about 650 BC.

&quot;Aigai&quot; is the name of several ancient Greek cities (see Etymology of the Aegean Sea). Their name is often derived from the name of a legendary founder, Aegeus. In the case of this city, it is also etymologized as &quot;city of goats&quot; (from αἴξ, &quot;aíks&quot;, &quot;goat&quot;) by Diodorus Siculus, who reports it was named so by Perdiccas I who was advised by the Pythian priestess to build the capital city of his kingdom where goats led him.

Archaeologic evidence shows that Aigai developed as an organized collection of villages, spatially representing the aristocratic structure of tribes centred on the power of the king. It remained so throughout its history. Indeed, Aigai never became a large city and most of its inhabitants lived in surrounding villages. The walled &quot;asty&quot; (acropolis) was built at the centre of Aigai.

From Aigai the Macedonians spread to the central part of Macedonia and displaced the local population of Pierians.

From 513 to 480 BC Aigai was part of the Persian Empire, but Amyntas I managed to keep its relative independence, avoid satrapy and extend its possessions.

In the first half of the 5th century BC Aigai became the capital of Macedonia. Life reached unseen levels of luxury and to meet the needs of the court merchants from all over the ancient world brought to Aigai valuable goods including perfume, carved ornaments and jewellery. The city wall was built in the 5th century, probably by Perdiccas II. At the end of the 5th century Archelaus I brought to his court artists, poets, and philosophers from all over the Greek world; for example, it was at Aigai that Euripides wrote and presented his last tragedies.

At the beginning of the 4th century BC, Archelaus transferred the Macedonian capital northeast to Pella on the central Macedonian plain.
Nevertheless, Aigai retained its role as the sacred city of the Macedonian kingdom, the site of the traditional cult centres, a royal palace and the royal tombs. For this reason it was here that Philip II was attending the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra to King Alexander of Epirus when he was murdered by one of his bodyguards in the theatre.
His was the most lavish funeral ceremony of historic times held in Greece. Laid on an elaborate gold and ivory deathbed wearing his precious golden oak wreath, the king was surrendered, like a new Hercules, to the funeral pyre.

The bitter struggles between the heirs of Alexander in the 3rd century adversely affected the city; in 276 BC Gallic mercenaries of Pyrrhus plundered many of the tombs.

After the overthrow of the Macedonian kingdom by the Romans in 168 BC, both old and new capitals were destroyed, the walls pulled down and all buildings burned. In the 1st century AD, a landslide destroyed what had been rebuilt (excavations establish that parts were still inhabited then).
In the 2nd to 5th centuries AD the population gradually moved from the foothills of the Pierian range to the plain, and all that remained was a small settlement whose name alone Palatitsia (palace) indicated its former importance.

The modern settlement of Vergina was established in 1922, between two preexisting villages, &quot;Kutlesh&quot; (Κούτλες, &quot;Koútles&quot;) and &quot;Barbes&quot; (Μπάρμπες, &quot;Bármpes&quot;), formerly part of the Ottoman Beylik of Palatitsia. In the 19th century, both Kutlesh and Barbes were Greek villages in the Ber Kaza of the Ottoman Empire. Several inhabitants of the two villages took part in the Greek uprising of 1821. Alexander Sinve (Les Grecs de l&#x27;Empire Ottoman. Etude Statistique et Ethnographique) wrote in 1878 that 120 Greeks lived in Barbas. According to the statistics of Vasil Kanchov (&quot;Macedonia. Ethnography and Statistics&quot;), in 1900, 60 Greek Christians lived in Kutlesh and 50 in Barbes. The town of Vergina was settled in the course of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey following the Treaty of Lausanne, by Greek families from Asia Minor. The name &quot;Vergina&quot; was a suggestion by the metropolitan of Veroia, chosen from a legendary queen Vergina (Bergina), who was said to have ruled somewhere north of the Haliacmon and to have had her summer palace near Palatitsia.
Vergina was a separate municipality from 1922 until 2011, when it was incorporated into Veroia. The population of Vergina municipality as of 2011 was 2,464, of whom 1,242 lived in Vergina proper.

==Archaeology==

Archaeologists were interested in the burial mounds around Vergina as early as the 1850s, supposing that the site of Aigai was in the vicinity. Excavations began in 1861 under the French archaeologist Léon Heuzey, sponsored by Napoleon III. Parts of a large building that was considered to be one of the palaces of Antigonus III Doson (263–221 BC), partly destroyed by fire, were discovered near Palatitsa, which preserved the memory of a palace in its modern name. However, the excavations had to be abandoned because of the risk of malaria. The excavator suggested that this was the site of the ancient city Valla, a view that prevailed until 1976.

In 1937, the University of Thessaloniki resumed the excavations. More ruins of the ancient palace were found, but the excavations were abandoned on the outbreak of war with Italy in 1940. After the war the excavations were resumed, and during the 1950s and 1960s the rest of the royal capital was uncovered, including the theatre.

The Greek archaeologist Manolis Andronikos became convinced that a hill called the &quot;Great Tumulus&quot; (Μεγάλη Τούμπα) concealed the tombs of the Macedonian kings. In 1977, Andronikos undertook a six-week dig at the Great Tumulus and found four buried tombs, two of which had never been disturbed. Andronikos identified that these were the burial sites of the kings of Macedon, including the tomb of Philip II, father of Alexander the Great (Tomb II) and also of Alexander IV of Macedon, son of Alexander the Great and Roxana (Tomb III). This view was challenged by some archaeologists, and in 2010 research based on detailed study of the skeletons, vindicated Andronikos and supports the evidence of facial asymmetry caused by a possible trauma of the cranium of the male, evidence that is consistent with the history of Philip II. From 1987 the burial cluster of the queens was discovered including the tomb of Queen Eurydice. In March 2014, five more royal tombs were discovered in Vergina, possibly belonging to Alexander I of Macedon and his family or to the family of Cassander of Macedon. Some artifacts excavated at Vergina may be treated as influenced by Asian practices or even imported from Achaemenid Persia in late 6th and early 5th centuries BC, which is during the time Macedon was under the Persian sway.

In 2023, nearly 50 years later, a study led by professor of anthropology at the Democritus University of Thrace Antonios Bartsiokas &#x27;conclusively&#x27; revealed that the skeleton long identified as belonging to Alexander IV of Macedon is in fact his father Philip II of Macedon, and vice versa: Tomb I contained Philip II, Alexander the Great&#x27;s father, tomb II belonged to Philip III of Macedon, Alexander the Great&#x27;s half-brother, while tomb III contained Alexander IV, Alexander the Great&#x27;s son. Tomb I also contained the remains of a woman and a baby, who Bartsiokas identified as Philip II&#x27;s young wife Cleopatra Eurydice and their newborn child. Cleopatra Eurydice was assassinated along with her newborn child.

===Royal burial cluster of Philip II===


The museum of the tumulus of Philip II, which was inaugurated in 1993, was built over the tombs leaving them &quot;in situ&quot; and showing the tumulus as it was before the excavations. Inside the museum there are four tombs and one small temple, the &quot;heroon&quot; built as the temple for the burial cluster of Philip II. The two most important tombs (II and III) were not sacked and contained the main treasures of the museum. Tomb II, likely that of Philip III, Alexander&#x27;s half-brother was discovered in 1977 and was separated in two rooms. The main room included a marble chest, and in it was the &quot;Golden Larnax&quot; made of 24-carat gold and weighing , embossed with the Vergina Sun symbol. Inside the golden larnax the bones of the dead were found and a golden wreath of 313 oak leaves and 68 acorns, weighing . In the room were also found the golden and ivory panoply of the dead, the richly carved burial bed on which he was laid and later burned and exquisite silver utensils for the funeral feast. Other magnificent items include several gold-adorned suits of armour, weapons, and bronze funeral utensils.

In the antechamber was another chest with another golden &quot;larnax&quot; containing the bones of a woman wrapped in a golden-purple cloth with a golden diadem decorated with flowers and enamel, indicating a queen (which was thought to be that of Philip II&#x27;s Thracian wife, Meda) who by tradition sacrificed herself at the funeral. Also included was another burial bed partially destroyed by the fire and on it a golden wreath representing leaves and flowers of myrtle. Above the Doric order entrance of the tomb is a magnificent wall painting measuring representing a hunting scene, believed to be the work of the celebrated Philoxenos of Eretria, and thought to show Philip and Alexander.

In 2025, after studies suggested that the burial in Tomb II was Phillip III instead of Phillip II as was previously believed, researchers concluded that some of the grave goods may in fact have belonged to Alexander the Great, as Phillip III inherited many of Alexander&#x27;s possessions.

Next to him in Tomb I, remains now thought to be that of Philip II or potentially Nicesipolis, was buried just a few years before in a cist grave, found unfortunately plundered. The only wall painting in the tomb pictures the Abduction of Persephone by the God of the Underworld, the silent Demeter and the three unprejudiced Fates with Hermes, the Guide of Souls, leading the way, and a scared nymph witnessing the horrifying event. This is a unique example of ancient painting, believed to be the work of the famous painter Nicomachus of Thebes, as well as one of the few surviving depictions of the ancient mystic views of afterlife.


In 1978 Tomb III was discovered, also near the tomb of Philip, which is thought to belong to Alexander IV of Macedon, son of Alexander the Great, murdered 25 years after Philip&#x27;s assassination. It is slightly smaller than Tomb II and was also not sacked. It was also arranged in two parts, but only the main room contained a cremated body. On a stone pedestal was found a fine silver hydria, which contained the cremated bones, and on it a golden oak wreath. There were also exquisite silver utensils and weaponry indicating royal status. A narrow frieze with a chariot race by a great painter decorated the walls of the tomb. The remains of a wooden mortuary couch adorned with gold and ivory is notable for an exquisite representation of Dionysos with a flute-player and a satyr.

Tomb IV, discovered in 1980, had an impressive entrance with four Doric columns though is heavily damaged and may have contained valuable treasures. It was built in the 4th century BC and may have belonged to Antigonus II Gonatas.

The great tumulus was constructed at the beginning of the third century BC (by Antigonos Gonatas) perhaps over smaller individual tumuli to protect the royal tombs from further pillaging after marauding Galati had looted and destroyed the cemetery. The hill material contained many earlier funeral stele.

===Palace of Aigai===
The most important building discovered is the monumental palace. Located on a plateau directly below the acropolis, this building of two or perhaps three stories is centred on a large open courtyard flanked by Doric colonnades. On the north side was a large gallery with a view of the stage of the neighbouring theatre and the whole Macedonian plain. The palace was sumptuously decorated, with mosaic floors, painted plastered walls, and fine relief tiles. The masonry and architectural members were covered with high-quality marble stucco. Excavations have dated its construction to the reign of Philip II, even though he also had a palace in the capital, Pella. It has been suggested that the building was designed by the architect Pytheos of Priene, known for his work on the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and for his views on urban planning and architectural proportions). The theatre, also from the second half of the 4th century BC, was closely associated with the palace.

Nearly 30 large columns that surrounded the palace&#x27;s main peristyle have been reconstructed, some towering to a height of 25 ft. The frieze on the peristyle&#x27;s southern section has also been reconstructed. Over 5,000 square feet of mosaics depicting a range of scenes, including the ravishing of Europa and motifs from nature have been carefully conserved. 

The Palace of Aigai is the largest building of classical Greece and is the location where Alexander the Great was proclaimed king in 336 BC.

The Palace of Aigai reopened to the public in January 2024 after an extensive 16 year restoration.

===Other tombs===

The cemetery of the tumuli extends for over and contains over 500 grave-mounds of significant wealth, some dating as early as the 11th century BC.

To the north-west of the ancient city is the important group of tombs from the 6th and 5th centuries BC belonging to members of the Macedonian dynasty and their courts.

The Cluster of the Queens includes cist and pit tombs dating to the Greco-Persian Wars era, two of which probably belong to the mother and spouse of Alexander I: the all golden &quot;Lady of Aigai&quot; and her female relative, in whose funeral at least twenty-six small terracotta statues. One from around 340 BC with an imposing marble throne is identified as that of Eurydice, mother of Philip II.

The so-called &quot;Ionic Tomb&quot; or &quot;Rhomaios&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, named after its excavator, Konstantinos Rhomaios, is an elegant Macedonian tomb with an Ionic facade consisting of four engaged columns crowned by a painted floral frieze, now no longer visible because of weathering. It contained a marble throne with armrests supported by sphinxes.

<text>Pretty-printing (or prettyprinting) is the application of any of various stylistic formatting conventions to text files, such as source code, markup, and similar kinds of content. These formatting conventions may entail adhering to an indentation style, using different color and typeface to highlight syntactic elements of source code, or adjusting size, to make the content easier for people to read, and understand. Pretty-printers for source code are sometimes called code formatters or beautifiers.

==Pretty-printing mathematics==
Pretty-printing usually refers to displaying mathematical expressions similar to the way they would be typeset professionally. For example, in computer algebra systems such as Maxima or Mathematica the system may write output like &quot;&lt;samp&gt;x ^ 2 + 3 * x&lt;/samp&gt;&quot; as Some graphing calculators, such as the Casio 9860 series, HP-49/50 series and HP Prime, TI-84 Plus, TI-89, and TI-Nspire, the TI-83 Plus with the PrettyPt add-on, or the TI-84 Plus with the same add-on or the &quot;MathPrint&quot;-enabled OSes, can perform pretty-printing. Additionally, a number of newer scientific calculators are equipped with dot matrix screens capable of pretty-printing such as the Casio FX-ES series (Natural Display), Sharp EL-W series (WriteView), HP SmartCalc 300s, TI-30XB, and Numworks.

Many text formatting programs can also typeset mathematics: TeX was developed specifically for high-quality mathematical typesetting.

==Pretty-printing markup and tag-based code==

Pretty-printing in markup language instances is most typically associated with indentation of tags and string content to visually determine hierarchy and nesting. Although the syntactical structures of tag-based languages do not significantly vary, the indentation may vary significantly due to how a markup language is interpreted or due to the data it describes.

In MathML, whitespace characters do not reflect data, meaning, or syntax above what is required by XML syntax. In HTML, whitespace characters between tags are considered text and are parsed as text nodes into the parsed result. While indentation may be generously applied to a MathML document, sufficient additional care must be taken in pretty-printing an HTML document to ensure additional text nodes are not created or destroyed in general proximity to the content or content-reflective tag elements. This difference in complexity is non-trivial from the perspective of an automated pretty-print operation where no special rules or edge cases are necessary, as in the more simple MathML example. The HTML example may require a series of progressive interrelated algorithms to account for various patterns of tag elements and content that conforms to a uniform style and is consistent in application across various instances, as evidenced by the markup.ts application component used to beautify HTML, XML, and related technologies for the Pretty Diff tool.

==Programming code formatting==
Programmers often use tools to format programming language source code in a particular manner. Proper code formatting makes it easier to read and understand. Different programmers often prefer different styles of formatting, such as the use of code indentation and whitespace or positioning of braces. A code formatter or code indenter converts source code from one format style to another. This is relatively straightforward because of the unambiguous syntax of programming languages. Code beautification involves parsing the source code into component structures, such as assignment statements, &quot;if&quot; blocks, loops, etc. (see also control flow), and formatting them in a manner specified by the user in a configuration file.

Code beautifiers exist as standalone applications and built into text editors and integrated development environments. For example, Emacs&#x27; various language modes can correctly indent blocks of code attractively.

===HTML===
===Lisp pretty-printer===
An early example of pretty-printing was Bill Gosper&#x27;s &quot;GRINDEF&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; &#x27;grind function&#x27;) program (&quot;c.&quot; 1967), which used combinatorial search with pruning to format LISP programs. Early versions operated on the executable (list structure) form of the Lisp program and were oblivious to the special meanings of various functions. Later versions had special read conventions for incorporating non-executable comments and also for preserving read macros in unexpanded form. They also allowed special indentation conventions for special functions such as codice_1. The term &quot;grind&quot; was used in some Lisp circles as a synonym for pretty-printing.

===Project style rules===
Many open source projects have established rules for code layout. The most typical are the GNU formatting and the BSD style. The biggest difference between the two is the location of the braces: in the GNU style, opening and closing braces are on lines by themselves, with the same indent. BSD style places an opening brace at the end of the preceding line, and the closing braces can be followed by else. The size of indent and location of whitespace also differs.

===Example of formatting and beautifying code===
The following example shows some typical C structures and how various indentation style rules format them. Without any formatting at all, it looks like this:

int foo(int k){if(k&lt;1||k&gt;2){printf(&quot;out of range\n&quot;);
printf(&quot;this function requires a value of 1 or 2\n&quot;);}else{
printf(&quot;Switching\n&quot;);switch(k){case 1:printf(&quot;1\n&quot;);break;case
2:printf(&quot;2\n&quot;);break;}}}

The GNU indent program produces the following output when asked to indent according to the GNU rules:

int
foo (int k)
 if (k &lt; 1 || k &gt; 2)
 printf (&quot;out of range\n&quot;);
 printf (&quot;this function requires a value of 1 or 2\n&quot;);
 else
 printf (&quot;Switching\n&quot;);
 switch (k)
 case 1:
 printf (&quot;1\n&quot;);
 break;
 case 2:
 printf (&quot;2\n&quot;);
 break;
 }

It produces this output when formatting according to BSD rules:

int
foo(int k) {
 if (k &lt; 1 || k &gt; 2) {
 printf(&quot;out of range\n&quot;);
 printf(&quot;this function requires a value of 1 or 2\n&quot;);
 } else {
 printf(&quot;Switching\n&quot;);
 switch (k) {
 case 1:
 printf(&quot;1\n&quot;);
 break;
 case 2:
 printf(&quot;2\n&quot;);
 break;
 }

<text>The Batak script (natively known as Surat Batak, Surat na Sampulu Sia (), or Sisiasia) is a writing system used to write the Austronesian Batak languages spoken by several million people on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The script may be derived from the Kawi and Pallava script, ultimately derived from the Brahmi script of India, or from the hypothetical Proto-Sumatran script influenced by Pallava.

==History==

The Batak magicians and priests or &quot;datu&quot; used the Batak script mainly for magical texts and divinatory purposes. It is unknown how many non-specialists were literate in the Batak script, but judging from the widespread tradition of writing love laments, especially among the Karo, Simalungun, and Angkola-Mandailing Batak, it is likely that a considerable part of the non-specialist population was able to read and write the Batak script. After the arrival of Europeans in the Batak lands, first German missionaries and, from 1878 onwards, the Dutch, the Batak script was, alongside the Roman script, taught in the schools, and teaching and religious materials were printed in the Batak script. Soon after the first World War the missionaries decided to discontinue printing books in the Batak script. The script soon fell out of use and is now only used for ornamental purposes.

==Origin==

The Batak script was probably derived from Pallava and Old Kawi scripts, which ultimately were derived from the Brahmi script, the root of almost all the Indic and Southeast Asian scripts.

==Structure==

Batak is written from left to right and top to bottom. Like all Brahmi-based scripts, each consonant has an inherent vowel of , unless there is a diacritic (in Toba Batak called &quot;pangolat&quot;) to indicate the lack of a vowel. Other vowels, final &quot;ŋ&quot;, and final velar fricative are indicated by diacritics, which appear above, below, or after the letter. For example, &quot;ba&quot; is written ba (one letter); &quot;bi&quot; is written ba.i (&quot;i&quot; follows the consonant); &quot;bang&quot; is written baŋ (&quot;ŋ&quot; is above the consonant); and &quot;bing&quot; is baŋ.i. Final consonants are written with the &quot;pangolat&quot; (here represented by &quot;#&quot;): &quot;bam&quot; is ba.ma.#. However, &quot;bim&quot; is written ba.ma.i.#: the first diacritic belongs to the first consonant, and the second belongs to the second consonant, but both are written at the end of the entire syllable. Unlike most Brahmi-based scripts, Batak does not form consonant conjuncts.

==Basic characters==

The basic characters are called &quot;surat&quot;. Each consonant has an inherent vowel of . The script varies by region and language. The major variants are between Karo, Mandailing, Pakpak/Dairi, Simalungun/Timur, and Toba:

==Diacritics==

Diacritics are used to change the pronunciation of a character. They can change the vowel from the inherent , mark a final [velar nasal] , mark a final velar fricative , or indicate a final consonant with no vowel:

===Ligatures with U===

The diacritic for U used by Mandailing, Pakpak, Simalungun, and Toba can form ligatures with its base character:

===Tompi===

In Mandailing, the diacritic &quot;tompi&quot; can be used to change the sound of some characters:

===Placement of diacritics for Ng and H===
The diacritics for Ng () and H () are usually written above spacing vowel diacritics instead of above the base character.&lt;br&gt;
Examples: ping, pong, peh, and pih.

===Diacritic reordering for closed syllables===

Vowel diacritics are reordered for closed syllables (that is, syllables where the final consonant has no vowel). Consonants with no vowel are marked by the Batak &quot;pangolat&quot; or &quot;panongonan&quot; diacritic, depending on the language.

When they are used for a closed syllable (like &quot;tip&quot;), both the vowel diacritic and the pangolat or panongonan are written at the end of the syllable.

Examples of closed syllables using &quot;pangolat&quot;:

==Punctuation and ornaments==

Batak is normally written without spaces or punctuation (as scriptio continua). However, special marks or bindu are occasionally used.

They vary greatly in size and design from manuscript to manuscript.

==Unicode==

Batak script was added to the Unicode Standard in October 2010 with the release of version 6.0.

===Block===

The Unicode block for Batak is U+1BC0–U+1BFF:

<text>Henry More (; 12 October 1614 – 1 September 1687) was an English philosopher of the Cambridge Platonist school.

==Biography==
Henry was born in Grantham, Lincolnshire on 12 October 1614. He was the seventh son of Alexander More, mayor of Grantham, and Anne More (née Lacy). Both his parents were Calvinists but he himself &quot;could never swallow that hard doctrine.&quot;

He was schooled at The King&#x27;s School, Grantham and at Eton College. In 1631 he entered Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, at about the time John Milton was leaving it. He took his BA in 1635, his MA in 1639, and immediately afterwards became a fellow of his college, turning down all other positions that were offered. He would not accept the mastership of his college, to which, it is understood, he would have been preferred in 1654, when Ralph Cudworth was appointed. In 1675, he finally accepted a prebend in Gloucester Cathedral, but only to resign it in favour of his friend Edward Fowler, afterwards bishop of Gloucester.

More taught many notable pupils, including Anne Finch, sister of Heneage Finch, subsequently Earl of Nottingham. She later became Lady Conway, and at her country seat at Ragley in Warwickshire, More would spend &quot;a considerable part of his time.&quot; She and her husband both appreciated him, and amidst the woods of this retreat he wrote several of his books. The spiritual enthusiasm of Lady Conway was a considerable factor in some of More&#x27;s speculations, even though she at length joined the Quakers. She became the friend not only of More and William Penn, but of Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont (1614–1699) and Valentine Greatrakes, mystical thaumaturgists of the 17th-century. Ragley became a centre of devotion and spiritualism.

==Views==
More was a rationalist theologian. He attempted to use the details of 17th-century mechanical philosophy—as developed by René Descartes—to establish the existence of immaterial substance.

More rejected Cartesian dualism on the following grounds: &quot;It would be easier for me to attribute matter and extension to the soul, than to attribute to an immaterial thing the capacity to move and be moved by the body.&quot; His difficulties with Cartesian dualism arose, not from an inability to understand how material and immaterial substances could interact, but from an unwillingness to accept any unextended entity as any kind of real entity. More continues &quot;...it is plain that if a thing be at all it must be extended.&quot; So for More &#x27;spirit&#x27; too must be extended. This led him to the idea of a &#x27;fourth dimension&#x27; (a term which he coined) in which the spirit is extended (to which he gave the curious name of &quot;essential spissitude&quot;) and to an original solution to the mind-body problem.

==Influence==
More appears to be the origin of the still-popular slur against medieval Scholasticism that it engaged in useless speculative debates, such as how many angels might dance on the head of a pin (or &quot;on a needles [sic] point,&quot; as he puts it), in the second chapter of &quot;The Immortality of the Soul&quot;.

A quotation from More is used as the epigraph of Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s essay &quot;The Over-soul&quot;.

Helena Blavatsky, the founder of Theosophy, quoted More and gave an exposition of his ideas in chapter VII of &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot;.

==Works==
More was a prolific writer of verse and prose. The &quot;Divine Dialogues&quot; (1688) condenses his general view of philosophy and religion. Like many others, he began as a poet and ended as a prose writer. His first work, published in 1642, but written two years earlier, was &quot;Psychodoia Platonica: or, a Platonicall Song of the Soul, consisting of four several Poems.&quot; It was followed in 1647 by his full collection of &quot;Philosophical Poems&quot;, which includes &quot;The Song of the Soul&quot;, enlarged and is dedicated to his father. A second edition was published in the same year, and it was included by A. B. Grosart in his Chertsey Worthies Library (1878).

More&#x27;s prose works are:

*&quot;Observations upon Anthroposophic Theomagica and Anima Magica Abscondita&quot;, by Alazonomastix Philalethes (pseudonym, see -mastix), 1650; in answer to Thomas Vaughan, who replied in &quot;The Man-mouse took in a Trape&quot;.
*&quot; The Second Lash of Alazonomastix&quot;, a rejoinder to Vaughan, 1651.
*&quot;An Antidote against Atheism, or an Appeal to the Natural Faculties of the Minde of Man, whether there be not a God,&quot; 1653: 2nd edit. corrected and enlarged, with an Appendix, 1655.
*&quot;Conjectura Cabbalistica ... or a Conjectural Essay of Interpreting the Minde of Moses, according to a Threefold Cabbala: viz. Literal, Philosophical, Mystical, or Divinely Moral&quot;, 1653; dedicated to Ralph Cudworth.
* &quot;Enthusiasm Triumphatus, or a Discourse of Nature, Causes, Kinds, and Cure of Enthusiasm; written by Philophilus Parrasiastes, and prefixed to Alazonomastix his Observations and Reply&quot;, 1656.
*&quot; The Immortality of the Soul, so far forth as it is demonstrable from the Knowledge of Nature and the Light of Reason&quot;, 1659; dedicated to Viscount Conway.
*&quot;An Explanation of the Grand Mystery of Godliness; or a True and Faithful Representation of the Everlasting Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ&quot;, 1660.
*&quot; A Modest Enquiry into the Mystery of Iniquity&quot;, and an &quot;Apologie&quot;, 1664.
*&quot;Enchiridion Ethicum, praecipua Moralis Philosophiae Rudimenta complectens, illustrate ut plurimum Veterum Monuments, et ad Probitatem Vitae perpetuo accommodate&quot;, 1667, 1668, 1669, 1695, 1696, and 1711.
*&quot;Divine Dialogues, containing sundry Disquisitions and Instructions concerning the Attributes of God and His Providence in the World&quot;, 1668. The most authentic edition appeared in 1713.
*&quot;An Exposition of the Seven Epistles to the Seven Churches; Together with a Brief Discourse of Idolatry, with application to the Church of Rome.&quot; The title of the latter in the volume itself is &quot;An Antidote against Idolatry&quot;, and it elicited from More in reply to attacks &quot;A brief Reply to a late Answer to Dr. Henry More his antidote against Idolatry&quot;, 1672, and &quot;An Appendix to the late Antidote against Idolatry&quot;, 1673.
*&quot;Enchiridion Metaphysicum: sive, de rebus incorporeis succincta et luculenta dissertatio; pars prima&quot;, 1671, an attack on Cartesian philosophy, which he had in earlier life admired.
*&quot;Remarks upon two late ingenious Discourses [by Matthew Hale]; the one, an Essay, touching the Gravitation and non-Gravitation of Fluid Bodies; the other, touching the Torricellian Experiment, so far forth as they may concern any passages in his &quot;Enchiridion Metaphysicum,&quot;&quot; 1676.
*&quot;Apocalypsis Apocalypseos; or the Revelation of St. John the Divine unveiled: an exposition from chapter to chapter and from verse to verse of the whole Book of the Apocalypse&quot;, 1680.
*&quot;A Plain and continued Exposition of the several Prophecies or Divine Visions of the Prophet Daniel, which have or may concern the People of God, whether Jew or Christian&quot;, 1681.
*&quot;A Brief Discourse of the Real Presence of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Celebration of the Holy Eucharist; wherein the Witty Artifices of the Bishop of Meaux [Bossuet] and of Monsieur Maimbourg are obviated, whereby they would draw in the Protestants to imbrace the doctrine of Transubstantiation&quot;, 1681.

More is also believed to have written &quot;Philosophiae Teutonicae Censura&quot;, 1670, a criticism of the theosophy of Jacob Boehme; and to have edited Joseph Glanvill&#x27;s &quot;Saducismus Triumphatus&quot;, 1681. He certainly contributed largely to the volume, and also wrote many of the annotations to Glanvill&#x27;s &quot;Lux Orientalis&quot;, 1682. More agreed with Glanvill on belief in witchcraft and apparitions. Several letters from More to John Worthington are printed in Worthington&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot;, and some &quot;Letters Philosophical and Moral&quot; between John Norris and Henry More are added to Norris&#x27;s &quot;Theory and Regulation of Love&quot;, 1688. &quot;A Collection of several Philosophical Writings of Dr. Henry More&quot; was first published in 1662 and includes his &quot;Antidote against Atheism&quot;, with the Appendix, &quot;Enthusiasmus Triumphatus&quot;, &quot;Letters to Des Cartes&quot;, &amp;c., &quot;Immortality of the Soul&quot;, and &quot;Conjectura Cabbalistica&quot;. A fourth edition, corrected and much enlarged, was published in 1712, with notes.

More issued complete editions of his works, his &quot;Opera theologica&quot; in 1675, and his &quot;Opera philosophica&quot; in 1678. Between 1672 and 1675 he was principally engaged in translating his English works into Latin. In 1675 appeared &quot;Henrici Mori Cantabrigiensis Opera Theologica, Anglice quidem primitius scripta, mine vero per autorem Latine reddita. Hisce novus praefixus est De Synchronismis Apocalypticis Tractatulus.&quot; It was followed in 1679 by a larger work in two volumes, &quot;Henrici Mori Cantabrigiensis Opera Omnia, tum quae Latine tum quae Anglice scripta sunt; nunc vero Latinitate donata instigatu et impensis generosissimi juvenis Johannis Cockshutt nobilis Angli&quot;. John Cockshutt of the Inner Temple had left a legacy of £300 to More to have three of his principal pieces translated into Latin; and More complied with the terms of the legacy by translating into Latin many more of his English works. In 1692 were published &quot;Discourses on Several Texts of Scripture&quot;, with a preface signed &quot;John Worthington&quot;; and in 1694 &quot;Letters on Several Subjects&quot;, published by Edmund Elys. Abridgments of and extracts from the works of More were numerous; and in 1708 a volume was published for charitable libraries, &quot;The Theological Works of the most Pious and Learned Henry More&quot;. The work is in English, but &quot;according to the author&#x27;s Improvements in his Latin edition&quot;.

The main authorities for More&#x27;s life are Richard Ward&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; (1710); the &quot;prefatio generalissima&quot; prefixed to his &quot;Opera omnia&quot; (1679); and also an account of his writings in an &quot;Apology&quot; published in 1664. His &quot;Philosophical Poems&quot; appeared (1647), with his Echief speculations and experiences&quot;. Analysis of his life and works is given in John Tulloch&#x27;s &quot;Rational Theology&quot;, vol. ii. (1874); see also Johann Georg Ritter von Zimmermann, &quot;Henry More und die vierte Dimension des Raums&quot; (Vienna, 1881); &quot;Henry More: Tercentenary Studies&quot;, ed. by Sarah Hutton (Dordrecht, 1990).

<text>John Little McClellan (February 25, 1896 – November 28, 1977) was an American lawyer and segregationist politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a U.S. Representative (1935–1939) and a U.S. Senator (1943–1977) from Arkansas.

At the time of his death, he was the second most senior member of the Senate and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He is the longest-serving senator in Arkansas history.

==Early life and career==
John Little McClellan was born on a farm near Sheridan, Arkansas to Isaac Scott and Belle (née Suddeth) McClellan. His parents, who were strong Democrats, named him after John Sebastian Little, who served as a U.S. Representative (1894–1907) and Governor of Arkansas (1907). His mother died only months after his birth, and he received his early education at local public schools. At age 12, after graduating from Sheridan High School, he began studying law in his father&#x27;s office.

He was admitted to the state bar in 1913, when he was only 17, after the Arkansas General Assembly approved a special act waiving the normal age requirement for certification as a lawyer. As the youngest attorney in the United States, he practiced law with his father in Sheridan. Also in 1913, McClellan married Eula Hicks; the couple had two children, and divorced in 1921.

During World War I, he served in the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant in the aviation section of the Signal Corps from 1917 to 1919. Following his military service, he moved to Malvern, where he opened a law office and served as city attorney (1920–26).

In 1922, he married Lucille Smith, to whom he remained married until her death in 1935; they had three children. He was prosecuting attorney of the seventh judicial district of Arkansas from 1927 to 1930.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 1934, McClellan was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives from Arkansas&#x27;s 6th congressional district. He was re-elected to the House in 1936. In March of that year, he condemned CBS for airing a speech by Communist leader Earl Browder, which he described as &quot;nothing less than treason.&quot;

During his tenure in the House, he voted against President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s court-packing plan, the Gavagan anti-lynching bill, and the Reorganization Act of 1937. In 1937, he wed for the third and final time, marrying Norma Myers Cheatham.

In 1938, McClellan unsuccessfully challenged first-term incumbent Hattie Caraway for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate. During the campaign, he criticized Caraway for her support for the 1937 Reorganization Act and accused her of having &quot;improper influence&quot; over federal employees in Arkansas. Nevertheless, he was defeated in the primary election by a margin of about 8,000 votes. He subsequently resumed the practice of law in Camden, where he joined the firm Gaughan, McClellan and Gaughan. He served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1940 (Chicago), 1944 (Chicago), and 1948 (Philadelphia).

==U.S. Senate==

In 1942, after G. Lloyd Spencer decided not to seek re-election, McClellan ran for the Senate again and this time won. He served as senator from Arkansas from 1943 to 1977, when he died in office. During his tenure, he served as chairman of the Appropriations Committee and served 22 years as chairman of the Committee on Government Operations. McClellan was the longest serving United States Senator in Arkansas history. During the later part of his Senate service, Arkansas had, perhaps, the most powerful congressional delegation with McClellan as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, J. William Fulbright as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Wilbur Mills as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Oren Harris as chairman of the House Commerce Committee, Ezekiel C. &quot;Took&quot; Gathings as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, and James William Trimble as a member of the powerful House Rules Committee.

McClellan also served for eighteen years as chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (1955–1973) and continued the hearings into subversive activities at the U.S. Army Signal Corps, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, where Soviet spies Julius Rosenberg, Al Sarant and Joel Barr all worked in the 1940s. He was a participant in the famous Army-McCarthy Hearings and led a Democratic walkout of that subcommittee in protest of Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s conduct in those hearings. McClellan appeared in the 2005 movie &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; in footage from the actual hearings.

He led two other investigations, both televised, uncovering spectacular law-breaking and corruption. The first of these, under the United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management, also known as the McClellan Committee, investigated union corruption and centered on Jimmy Hoffa and lasted from January 1957 to March 1960. In April 1961, during an Investigations subcommittee hearing, contractor Henry Gable asserted that Communists would not be able to do the same amount of damage to the American missile effort as done by labor at Cape Canaveral. McClellan suggested that the comments bordered on accusations of subversion and called for more testimony from the unions.

The second televised major investigation led by McClellan was in 1964 and known as the Valachi hearings. These hearings investigated the operations of organized crime and featured the testimony of Joseph Valachi, the first American mafia figure to testify about its criminal activities. McClellan continued his efforts against organized crime (including backing the anti-organized-crime (RICO) law) until 1973, when he switched to investigating political subversion. During this period, he hired Robert F. Kennedy as chief counsel and vaulted him into the national spotlight. McClellan investigated numerous cases of government corruption including numerous defense contractors and Texas financier Billie Sol Estes.

In 1957, McClellan opposed U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s decision to send federal troops to enforce the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock. Prior to the sending of the troops under the command of Major General Edwin A. Walker, McClellan had expressed &quot;regret [regarding] the ... use of force by the federal government to enforce integration. I believe it to be without authority of law. I am very apprehensive that such action may precipitate more trouble than it will prevent.&quot;

McClellan and fellow Senator Robert S. Kerr of Oklahoma were the sponsors of the bill that authorized construction of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers. The system transformed the often shallow and sometimes dry Arkansas River into a major transportation route and water source.

Although his Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management already had been dissolved by 1960, McClellan began a related three-year investigation in 1963, through the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, into the union benefit plans of labor leader George Barasch, alleging misuse and diversion of $4,000,000 of benefit funds.

McClellan&#x27;s notable failure to find any legal wrongdoing led to his introduction of several pieces of new legislation including his own bill on October 12, 1965 setting new fiduciary standards for plan trustees. Senator Jacob K. Javits (R-NY) introduced bills in 1965 and 1967 increasing regulation on welfare and pension funds to limit the control of plan trustees and administrators. Provisions from all three bills ultimately evolved into the guidelines enacted in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

In 1977, McClellan was one of five Democrats to vote against the nomination of F. Ray Marshall as United States Secretary of Labor.

==Personal life==
McClellan&#x27;s second wife died of spinal meningitis in 1935 and his son Max died of the same disease in 1943 while serving in Africa during World War II. His son, John L. Jr., died in 1949 in an automobile accident, and his son James H. died in a plane crash in 1958. Both men were members of the Xi chapter of Kappa Sigma fraternity at the University of Arkansas. To honor their two fallen brothers, the Chapter initiated Senator McClellan into Kappa Sigma in 1965.

McClellan died in his sleep on November 28, 1977, in Little Rock, Arkansas, following surgery to implant a pacemaker. He was buried at Roselawn Memorial Park in Little Rock. A VA Hospital in Little Rock is named in his honor. A chapter of the Delta Theta Phi Law Fraternity at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock Bowen School of Law is named in his honor. Ouachita Baptist University is the repository for his official papers.

<text>Johann Georg Ritter von Zimmermann / Johann Georg Zimmermann (8 December 1728, in Brugg, Aargau7 October 1795, in Hanover) was a Swiss philosophical writer, naturalist, and physician. He was the private physician of George III and later Frederick the Great.

==Life and works==
He studied at Göttingen, where he took the degree of a doctor of medicine, and established his reputation by the dissertation, &quot;De irritabilitate&quot; (1751). After traveling in the Netherlands and France, he practised as a city physician () in Brugg, and wrote &quot;Über die Einsamkeit&quot; (&quot;&quot;Of solitude&quot;, 1756, 1784–1785) and &quot;Vom Nationalstolz&quot; (&quot;Of national pride&quot;&quot;, 1758). These books made a great impression in Germany, and were translated into almost every European language.

In Zimmermann&#x27;s character there was a strange combination of sentimentalism, melancholy and enthusiasm; and it was by the free and eccentric expression of these qualities that he excited the interest of his contemporaries. Another of his books, written at Brugg, &quot;Von der Erfahrung in der Arzneiwissenschaft&quot; (&quot;Of experience in pharmacology&quot;, 1764), also attracted much attention. In 1768 he settled at Hanover as a private physician of George III with the title of a Hofrat. Catherine II invited him to the court of St Petersburg, but this invitation he declined.

He attended Frederick the Great during that monarch&#x27;s last illness, and afterwards issued various books about him, of which the chief were &quot;Über Friederich den Grossen und meine Unterredung mit ihm kurz vor seinem Tode&quot; (&quot;&quot;On Frederick the Great and my conversation with him shortly before his death&quot;,&quot; 1788) and &quot;Fragmente über Friedrich den Grossen&quot; (&quot;Fragments on Frederick the Great&quot;, 1790). According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;[t]hese writings display extraordinary personal vanity, and convey a wholly false impression of Frederick&#x27;s character.&quot;

He has a daughter named Katharina von Zimmermann who died in her 20s from tuberculosis, which also killed her mother and grandmother.

<text>Edward Fowler (1632 – 26 August 1714) was an English churchman, Bishop of Gloucester from 1691 until his death.

== Early life and education ==

He was born at Westerleigh, Gloucestershire, and was educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, later moving to Trinity College, Cambridge.

== Writings ==

Fowler was suspected of Pelagian tendencies, and his earliest book was a &quot;Free Discourse in defence of The Practices of Certain Moderate Divines called Latitudinarians&quot; (1670). This supported Samuel Parker and his &quot;Discourse of Ecclesiastical Polity&quot; of 1669. It also took aim at Thomas Hobbes, by means of positions set out by Daniel Scargill, an apostate Hobbist.

The &quot;Design of Christianity&quot;, published in the following year, in which he laid stress on the moral design of revelation, was criticized by Richard Baxter in his &quot;How far Holiness is the Design of Christianity&quot; (1671) and by John Bunyan in his &quot;Defence of the Doctrine of Justification by Faith&quot; (1672). Bunyan described the &quot;Design&quot; as &quot;a mixture of Popery, Socinianism and Quakerism,&quot; an accusation to which Fowler replied in a scurrilous pamphlet entitled &quot;Dirt Wip&#x27;d Off&quot;. He also published, in 1693, &quot;Twenty-Eight Propositions&quot;, by which the Doctrine of the Trinity is endeavoured to be explained, challenging with some success the Socinian position.

== Offices ==

He was successively rector of St. Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church, Northill, Bedfordshire (1656) and of All Hallows, Bread Street, London (1673), and in 1676 was elected a canon of Gloucester; his friend, Henry More, one of the Cambridge Platonists, resigned in his favour. In 1681 he became vicar of St Giles, Cripplegate, but after four years was suspended for being a Whig. When the Declaration of Indulgence was published in 1687 he successfully influenced the London clergy against reading it.

== Bishopric ==

In 1691 he was consecrated Bishop of Gloucester and held the see until his death.

<doc id="334569" wikidata="Q7668186" url="?curid=334569" title="Alexandria City High School">
<text>Alexandria City High School (formerly named T. C. Williams High School) is a public high school in the City of Alexandria, Virginia, United States, just outside of Washington, D.C. The school has an enrollment of over 4,100 students. The high school is located near the geographic center of Alexandria. Titans are the school mascot and the school colors are blue, white and red. The school&#x27;s football team was the subject of the 2000 film &quot;Remember the Titans&quot;.

The school offers numerous Advanced Placement courses for its students. Alexandria City HS has an Army Junior ROTC program which participated in President Barack Obama&#x27;s Inaugural Parade.
The ACHS Marching Band travels to competitions up and down the East Coast.

The school was originally named after Thomas Chambliss Williams, former superintendent of Alexandria City Public Schools from the 1930s to 1963 and an ardent supporter of racial segregation. The school was renamed Alexandria City High School on July 1, 2021, following protests against the school being named after Williams.

==History==
In 1958, Alexandria Public Schools Superintendent Thomas Chambliss Williams fired an elementary school cafeteria worker when he found out she had joined in a lawsuit to integrate the area&#x27;s schools.

T. C. Williams, a four-year high school, initially opened its doors to eighth graders, freshmen, sophomores, and juniors in 1965, and graduated its first class in June 1967. It was Alexandria&#x27;s third public high school and Minnie Howard Middle School was its &quot;feeder&quot; school, for seventh and eighth graders.

In 1965 the city integrated schools. In 1971 the city consolidated all high school students into T. C. Williams, so that the school became Alexandria&#x27;s only public senior high school serving 11th and 12th graders. The city&#x27;s freshmen and sophomores attended Francis C. Hammond and George Washington, the other former four-year schools involved in the three school consolidation. While T. C. Williams and George Washington were already integrated in 1971, Hammond was nearly all white, while the city was about one-fifth black.

Increasing enrollment prompted plans for a new school. In January 2004, the Alexandria School Board approved a plan to build an entirely new school building at the existing location to provide more space. The new building opened on September 4, 2007. The original T. C. Williams building was demolished in January 2008. The new T. C. Williams campus was certified LEED Gold by the U.S. Green Building Council in 2009.

The gym of the original T. C. Williams building was named after Gerry Bertier, a member of the Titans&#x27; 1971 state championship football team who was paralyzed in a car crash and died 10 years later in a second auto accident near Charlottesville, Virginia. The newly constructed basketball court was named in honor of the late Earl Lloyd on December 1, 2007. Lloyd attended Parker-Gray High School, which was Alexandria&#x27;s all-black high school at the time. Lloyd was the first African-American to play in the NBA.

The football stadium is named Parker-Gray Stadium in deference to the former pre-segregation high school, whose campus was sold for office buildings in the 1980s. The football field was grass until an artificial turf was installed in 2006.

During his run for the Democratic nomination, Barack Obama held a rally at T. C. Williams on February 10, 2008.

&quot;A. C.&quot; serves 9th through 12th grade students at both the King Street Campus and the A.C. Minnie Howard Campus, located 0.6 miles (1.0 km) from the main building. Two middle schools, Francis C. Hammond Middle School (1.8 miles west), and George Washington Middle School (2.0 miles south east), serve 6th through 8th grade students and are housed in the former high schools.

===2020 movement for name change===
In 2020, in part inspired by the civil rights protests across the United States, a push to rename T.C. Williams began. Advocates for the change argued that the school&#x27;s namesake, former superintendent Thomas Chambliss Williams, was a segregationist and had been unwilling to integrate Alexandria City schools. Although there had been past community efforts to rename the school, including in two efforts in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the efforts in 2020 were significantly larger and attracted more media coverage. A petition was circulated in June 2020 and submitted to the school board later that month. ACPS announced it would begin a review of the school&#x27;s name, with a public engagement portion to be held in the fall of 2020. A report with recommendations is expected to be completed and sent to the school board in the spring of 2021. The move to rename T.C. Williams sparked a similar movement to name another ACPS school, Matthew Maury Elementary. In November 2020, the Alexandria City Public Schools School Board voted unanimously to rename the school, with the name Alexandria City High School selected on April 8, 2021.

==Demographics==
As of November 2017, Alexandria City High School&#x27;s student body is 42.3% Hispanic, 28.8% African American, 22.0% White, 4.6% Asian, 0.2% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and 2.1% Multi-racial.

Alexandria City High also has a thriving International Academy program, part of the wider International Academy Network, which serves to accommodate the large surge of immigrants to the Washington, DC, area by teaching English to non-native speakers alongside a rigorous, credit-earning high school curriculum. The International Academy currently has an enrollment of around 600 students, and contains speakers of over 60 languages.

== Minnie Howard Campus ==
The Minnie Howard Campus, which currently serves as one of the two high school campuses for students, was built in 1954 as a 1st–7th grade elementary school. The transition to a 9th grade campus was made in 1969 due to a large and fast growth of the elementary age population in the area. The school was a single building with a field for lacrosse, soccer, and various other sports.

In 2019, because of capacity issues at both Minnie Howard and the main campus, the city approved on a plan to build a new, larger building on the Minnie Howard Campus with space for 1,600 students. It is now a &quot;connected high school network&quot;, with both campuses serving grades 9 through 12 and programs spread between the two locations.

In March 2022, construction began on the new building, which opened for the 2024–2025 school year. Its new multi-purpose field opened in 2025.

== Academics ==
Alexandria City offers more than a dozen AP courses. It has been ranked by the 2016 Washington Post &quot;Challenge Index&quot; with an index of 2.836. Under the leadership of Dr. Manu Patel, T. C. was the first Virginia high school to defeat Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, Virginia, at the Science Bowl. The school also offers five foreign languages to students: Spanish, German, French, Latin, and Chinese.

Alexandria City allows students to apply into specialized academies within the school. These include the STEM academy and Governor&#x27;s Health Sciences Academy, a collaborative effort with George Washington University that when successfully completed provides students with guaranteed admissions into the George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences.

In March 2010, Alexandria City school was a persistently low achieving school based on its average standardized test scores.

===Technology initiative===
A.C. offers Google Chromebooks to all of its students. The initiative, which began in the 2004–2005 school year, provides every student with their own personal computer, as well as campus-wide wireless Internet access. Wireless access is available at the school during daytime hours and in the evenings at the school library.
Internet access is restricted and blocks download sites, entertainment sites, and others that could distract students from their work during class. For students that may have trouble obtaining internet access outside of school, mobile broadband devices are available to students who need them.

==Extra-curricular activities==
A. C. teams play in the AAA Patriot District of Region 6C, formerly the AAA Northern Region. The school mascot is a Titan. The school colors, blue, white and red, are a synthesis of the former colors of the three pre-1971 four-year high schools: blue (from G. W.), white (from Hammond), and red (T. C. W.). The Titans are best known for their football program, which the movie &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; was based upon. The boys&#x27; basketball program, a consistent powerhouse with 12 district, 10 regional, and 2 state championships (most recently in 2008) has also gained statewide recognition. The rowing team has won numerous state and national championships, the most recent being a gold medal in the State Championship for the men&#x27;s 4V team. A. C. has won state championships in football, soccer, cross country, indoor and outdoor track. The football program has won three Virginia AAA state championships: 1971, 1984, and 1987, all of which the Titans finished ranked in the top ten nationally, and the 1971 team was made famous in the movie &quot;Remember the Titans&quot;, released in 2000. A. C. students managed the feat of winning all three boys&#x27; state running championships in consecutive school years, winning the 1991 Cross Country, 1992 Indoor Track, 1992 Outdoor Track, 1992 Cross Country, 1993 Indoor Track, and 1993 Outdoor Track State Championships. They were nationally recognized in 1993 when they became the first ever U.S. high school 4 × 100 meter relay team to defeat the Jamaicans at Penn Relays.

A. C. boys soccer won the Virginia 6A state championship in 2014 and finished the season ranked number one in the Washington, DC, area and number 9 nationally, evoking the slogan &quot;Remember These Titans.&quot; The girls&#x27; volleyball team won the state title in the pandemic-shortened 2020–2021 season and again in 2022–2023. Girls&#x27; basketball and boys&#x27; tennis teams have all captured district championships since 2006. Additionally, the soccer team captured a state title in 2014, with a 2–0 win over Washington-Lee High School.

Because A. C. is the only public high school in Alexandria City, and the only non-Fairfax County high school in the Patriot District, the Titans do not have a sole rival school. The Titans do have a rivalry against Lake Braddock Secondary School because of recent competition. The Titans have developed rivalries against Hayfield Secondary School in recent years due to the success of both schools&#x27; basketball teams, as well as West Potomac High School, which is located close to Alexandria. Recently, A.C.&#x27;s rivalry with Hayfield was partially severed as Hayfield moved into another district due to a decline in enrollment. The two schools, which competed against each other in the 2009 Boys&#x27; Basketball Northern Region Championship Game, both missed the regional playoffs in 2010 due to eligibility issues of players. A. C. had to forfeit 12 wins and lost two players including a key starter for the rest of the season. They lost in the first round of the district tournament.

===Football and &quot;Remember the Titans&quot;===
T. C. and its former football coaches, Herman Boone and Bill Yoast, were the subject of the 2000 motion picture &quot;Remember the Titans&quot;, starring Denzel Washington and Will Patton. The movie was a heavily fictionalized dramatization of the consolidation of Alexandria&#x27;s three public high schools into one in the fall of 1971. That year, ACPS consolidated its three four-year high schools into a single two-year school, teaching solely juniors and seniors. As a result, the best of the varsity football squads at George Washington High School (converted to a middle school), Hammond High School (converted to a middle school) and T. C. Williams High School united in what amounted to an all-city, all-star team at T. C. Williams. The city&#x27;s public schools were legally desegregated in 1959. The three high schools had become racially imbalanced during the 1960s, due to redlining. Racial tension is one of the themes of the film. Yoast was the head coach at Hammond, who won the state title in 1970, while Boone was a head coach at E.J. Hayes High School in Williamston, North Carolina, with five state championships and a 99–8 () record in nine seasons, from 1961 through 1969. He was not retained after a consolidation and integration of two high schools. Boone was hired as an assistant at T.C. Williams, and expected to be to Yoast&#x27;s assistant after the Alexandria consolidation in 1971.

The climax of the movie is the fictionalized 1971 AAA state championship football game between T. C. Williams and George C. Marshall High School. The dramatic license taken in the movie was to convert what was actually a mid-season matchup between T. C. Williams and Marshall into a made-for-Hollywood state championship. In reality, the Marshall game was the toughest game T. C. Williams played all year and the actual state championship (against Andrew Lewis High School of Salem) was a 27–0 blowout. As depicted in the movie, the real Titans won the Marshall game on a fourth down come-from-behind play at the very end of the game.

T. C. Williams was referenced in the &quot;My No Good Reason&quot; episode of the television show &quot;Scrubs&quot;. Three actors wearing T. C. Williams letter jackets appear towards the end of the episode. Donald Faison, who plays Dr. Turk on the sitcom, also starred in &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; as Petey Jones. Jones died in July 2019, aged 65.

=== Rugby ===
Alexandria City has both boys and girls varsity rugby teams. Coached for the last 16 years by Jeff Murphy, they currently compete against teams in the DC metro area; including Gonzaga College High School, Landon, and The Heights School. The Titans program has produced notable players such as US Air force and Seattle Seawolves forward Capt. Eric Duechle.

===Rowing===
A.C. is known for its nationally and internationally competitive rowing program, which has its own boathouse on the Alexandria bank of the Potomac River. A.C. Crew has claimed state, national, and international championships. The program has produced several Olympic athletes, most recently Nick Peterson and Linda Miller, who represented the United States at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.

The TC Williams boys crew is the successor to the first high school rowing program in the Washington metro area. In 1947, Jack Franklin and Julian Whitestone began training young men from Alexandria&#x27;s George Washington High School (now Middle School) at the Old Dominion Boat Club. Francis Hammond High School opened in 1956 and soon had its own crew, as did the new TC Williams High School in 1964. George Washington and Hammond merged with TC in 1971.

Over the years, these crews have won medals at local, state, national and international competitions including the Stotesbury Cup, the SRAA Nationals and the Canadian Scholastic Championship. Rowers trained at TC have gone on to college success, and the program has produced Olympic rowers, and members of the US National and Junior National teams.

===Arts===
A.C. is also known for its strides in the arts. Its band program continues to grow and get national coverage, playing across the country, most recently at the 2014 Sugar Bowl. The school also houses thriving programs in Orchestra, Choir, Visual Art, and Theater, the latter of which is continuing to rise in popularity.

The A.C. Theater department participates in both the Cappies program and the VHSL&#x27;s One-Act Competition, faring very well in both arenas. In recent memory, three one-act plays, &quot;Ladying&quot;, &quot;Shuffling&quot;, and &quot;The Brick Joke&quot;, have made it to the Regional level of One-Acts, in 2010, 2013, and 2020 respectively. The A.C. Drama Department has also received attention for choosing shows that are considered risky for high schools, including 2010s &quot;Chicago&quot;; &quot;Rent&quot; and &quot;The Laramie Project&quot; in 2011; 2012&#x27;s &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot;, the 2014 production of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, and the 2015 production of &quot;.&quot;

<text>John Tulloch (1 June 1823 – 13 February 1886) was a Scottish theologian and Presbyterian minister.

==Life==
Tulloch was born at Dron, south of Bridge of Earn, Perthshire, one of twin sons of Elizabeth (née Maclaren), the daughter of a Perthshire farmer, and William Weir Tulloch, parish minister of Tibbermore, near Perth.

He was educated at Perth Grammar School and studied Divinity at the universities of St Andrews and Edinburgh. He was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Perth in March 1844. In March 1845 (following a period as assistant) he was ordained as minister of St Paul&#x27;s church in Dundee, and in 1849 was translated to Kettins, in Strathmore, where he remained for six years. In 1854 he was appointed Principal of St Mary&#x27;s College, St Andrews. The appointment was immediately followed by the appearance of his Burnet prize essay on &quot;Theism&quot;.

At St Andrews, where Tulloch was also professor of systematic theology and apologetics, his teaching was distinguished by several novel features. He lectured on comparative religion and treated doctrine historically, as being not a fixed product but a growth. He was appointed as one of Her Majesty&#x27;s Chaplains for Scotland and preached a number of sermons before Her Majesty the Queen in Scotland between 1866 and 1876.

Tulloch was popular with his students. In 1862 he was appointed a clerk of the General Assembly, and from then on he took a leading part in the councils of the Church of Scotland. Tulloch was also deeply interested in the reorganization of education in Scotland, both in school and university, and acted as one of the temporary board which settled the primary school system under the Education Act of 1872.

In 1878 Tulloch was chosen to be Moderator of the General Assembly, and did much to widen the national church. Two positions on which he repeatedly insisted took a firm hold—first, that a church must be comprehensive of various views and tendencies, and that a national church especially should seek to represent all the elements of the life of the nation; secondly, that subscription to a creed can bind no one to all its details, but only to the sum and substance, or the spirit, of the symbol.

For three years before Tulloch&#x27;s death he was convener of the church interests committee of the Church of Scotland, which had to deal with agitation for disestablishment. In 1884, he was a guest at Haddo House for a dinner hosted by John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair in honour of William Ewart Gladstone on his tour of Scotland.

Tulloch died at Torquay, in 1886. A biography was written by Mrs Oliphant. His body was returned to Scotland for burial. He is buried beneath a large memorial at the centre of the Eastern Cemetery in St Andrews. His wife, Jane Anne Sophia (1826-1887) is buried with him.

==Works==
Tulloch&#x27;s best-known works are collections of biographical sketches of leaders in church history, including those of the Reformation and Puritanism. His major work, &quot;Rational Theology and Christian Philosophy&quot; (1872), treats the Cambridge Platonists and other 17th century latitudinarians in a similar way. He delivered the second series of the Croall lectures, on the Doctrine of Sin, which were afterwards published. He also published a small work, &quot;The Christ of the Gospels and the Christ of History&quot;, in which the views of Ernest Renan on the gospel history were dealt with; a monograph on Blaise Pascal for Blackwood&#x27;s Foreign Classics for English Readers series; and a little work, &quot;Beginning Life&quot;, addressed to young men, written at an earlier period.

<doc id="334591" wikidata="Q294169" url="?curid=334591" title="Jan Baptist van Helmont">
<text>Jan Baptist van Helmont ( , ; 12 January 1580 – 30 December 1644) was a chemist, physiologist, and physician from Brussels. He worked during the years just after Paracelsus and the rise of iatrochemistry, and is sometimes considered to be &quot;the founder of pneumatic chemistry&quot;. Van Helmont is remembered today largely for his 5-year willow tree experiment, his introduction of the word &quot;gas&quot; (from the Greek word &quot;chaos&quot;) into the vocabulary of science, and his ideas on spontaneous generation.

== Early life and education ==
Jan Baptist van Helmont was the youngest of five children of Maria (van) Stassaert and Christiaen van Helmont, a public prosecutor and Brussels council member, who had married in the Sint-Goedele church in 1567. He was educated at Leuven, and after ranging restlessly from one science to another and finding satisfaction in none, turned to medicine. He interrupted his studies, and for a few years he traveled through Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany, and England.

Returning to his own country, van Helmont obtained a medical degree in 1599. He practiced at Antwerp at the time of the great plague in 1605, after which he wrote a book titled &quot;De Peste&quot; (On Plague), which was reviewed by Newton in 1667. In 1609 he finally obtained his doctoral degree in medicine. The same year he married Margaret van Ranst, who was of a wealthy noble family. Van Helmont and Margaret lived in Vilvoorde, near Brussels, and had six or seven children. The inheritance of his wife enabled him to retire early from his medical practice and occupy himself with chemical experiments until his death on 30 December 1644.

== Scientific ideas ==
=== Mysticism and modern science ===
Van Helmont was a disciple of the mystic and alchemist, Paracelsus, though he scornfully repudiated the errors of most contemporary authorities, including Paracelsus. On the other hand, he engaged in the new learning based on experimentation that was producing men like Santorio Santori, William Harvey, Galileo Galilei and Francis Bacon.

=== Chemistry ===
==== Conservation of mass ====
Van Helmont was a careful observer of nature; his analysis of data gathered in his experiments suggests that he had a concept of the conservation of mass. He was an early experimenter in seeking to determine how plants gain mass.

==== Elements ====
For Van Helmont, air and water were the two primitive elements. Fire he explicitly denied to be an element, and earth is not one because it can be reduced to water.

==== Gases ====

Van Helmont is regarded as the founder of pneumatic chemistry, as he was the first to understand that there are gases distinct in kind from atmospheric air and furthermore invented the word &quot;gas&quot;.
He derived the word gas from the Greek word chaos (χᾰ́ος).

==== Carbon dioxide ====
He perceived that his &quot;gas sylvestre&quot; (carbon dioxide) given off by burning charcoal, was the same as that produced by fermenting must, a gas which sometimes renders the air of caves unbreathable.

=== Digestion ===
Van Helmont wrote extensively on the subject of digestion. In &quot;Oriatrike or Physick Refined&quot; (1662, an English translation of &quot;Ortus medicinae&quot;), van Helmont considered earlier ideas on the subject, such as food being digested through the body&#x27;s internal heat. But if that were so, he asked, how could cold-blooded animals live? His own opinion was that digestion was aided by a chemical reagent, or &quot;ferment&quot;, within the body, such as inside the stomach. Harré suggests that van Helmont&#x27;s theory was &quot;very near to our modern concept of an enzyme&quot;.

Van Helmont proposed and described six different stages of digestion.

=== Willow tree experiment ===
Helmont&#x27;s experiment on a willow tree has been considered among the earliest quantitative studies on plant nutrition and growth and as a milestone in the history of biology. The experiment was only published posthumously in &quot;Ortus Medicinae&quot; (1648) and may have been inspired by similar experiments by Santorio, published in &quot;Ars de statica medicina&quot; (1614). Helmont grew a willow tree and measured the amount of soil, the weight of the tree and the water he added. After five years the plant had gained about 164 lbs (74 kg). Since the amount of soil was nearly the same as it had been when he started his experiment (it lost only 57 grams), he deduced that the tree&#x27;s weight gain had come entirely from water.

=== Spontaneous generation ===
Van Helmont described a recipe for the spontaneous generation of mice (a piece of dirty cloth plus wheat for 21 days) and scorpions (basil, placed between two bricks and left in sunlight). His notes suggest he may have attempted to do these things.

== Religious and philosophical opinions ==
Although a faithful Catholic, he incurred the suspicion of the Church by his tract &quot;De magnetica vulnerum curatione&quot; (1621), against Jean Roberti, since he could not explain the effects of his &#x27;miraculous cream&#x27;. The Jesuits therefore argued that Helmont used &#x27;magic&#x27; and convinced the inquisition to scrutinize his writings. It was the lack of scientific evidence that drove Roberti to this step. His works were collected and edited by his son Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont and published by Lodewijk Elzevir in Amsterdam as &quot;Ortus medicinae, vel opera et opuscula omnia&quot; (&quot;The Origin of Medicine, or Complete Works&quot;) in 1648. &quot;Ortus medicinae&quot; was based on, but not restricted to, the material of &quot;Dageraad ofte Nieuwe Opkomst der Geneeskunst&quot; (&quot;Daybreak, or the New Rise of Medicine&quot;), which was published in 1644 in Van Helmont&#x27;s native Dutch. His son Frans&#x27;s writings, &quot;Cabbalah Denudata&quot; (1677) and &quot;Opuscula philosophica&quot; (1690) are a mixture of theosophy, mysticism and alchemy.

Over and above the &quot;archeus&quot;, he believed that there is the sensitive soul which is the husk or shell of the immortal mind. Before the Fall the archeus obeyed the immortal mind and was directly controlled by it, but at the Fall men also received the sensitive soul and with it lost immortality, for when it perishes the immortal mind can no longer remain in the body.

Van Helmont described the &quot;archeus&quot; as &quot;aura vitalis seminum, vitae directrix&quot; (&quot;The chief Workman [Archeus] consists of the conjoyning of the vitall air, as of the matter, with the seminal likeness, which is the more inward spiritual kernel, containing the fruitfulness of the Seed; but the visible Seed is onely the husk of this.&quot;).

In addition to the archeus, van Helmont believed in other governing agencies resembling the archeus which were not always clearly distinguished from it. From these he invented the term &quot;blas&quot; (motion), defined as the &quot;vis motus tam alterivi quam localis&quot; (&quot;twofold motion, to wit, locall, and alterative&quot;), that is, natural motion and motion that can be altered or voluntary. Of&quot; blas&quot; there were several kinds, e.g. blas humanum (blas of humans), blas of stars and blas meteoron (blas of meteors); of meteors he said &quot;constare gas materiâ et blas efficiente&quot; (&quot;Meteors do consist of their matter Gas, and their efficient cause Blas, as well the Motive, as the altering&quot;).

Van Helmont &quot;had frequent visions throughout his life and laid great stress upon them&quot;. His choice of a medical profession has been attributed to a conversation with the angel Raphael, and some of his writings described imagination as a celestial, and possibly magical, force. Though Van Helmont was skeptical of specific mystical theories and practices, he refused to discount magical forces as explanations for certain natural phenomena. This stance, reflected in a 1621 paper on sympathetic principles, may have contributed to his prosecution, and subsequent house arrest several years later, in 1634, which lasted a few weeks. The trial, however, never came to a conclusion. He was neither sentenced nor rehabilitated.

== Disputed portrait ==
In 2003, the historian Lisa Jardine proposed that a portrait held in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London, traditionally identified as John Ray, might represent Robert Hooke. Jardine&#x27;s hypothesis was subsequently disproved by William B.

In 1875, he was honoured by Belgian botanist Alfred Cogniaux (1841–1916), who named a genus of flowering plants from South America, &quot;Helmontia&quot; (from the Cucurbitaceae family).

<text>There are 52 state parks in the U.S. state of Arkansas, as of 2025. The state parks division of the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage, and Tourism is the governing body and operator of all parks, although jurisdiction is shared with other state agencies in a few cases.

The first Arkansas state park, Petit Jean State Park, opened in 1923 following an unsuccessful attempt by a lumber company to donate the Seven Hollows and canyon areas to the federal government as a National Park. Stephen Mather deemed the parcel too small in 1921, but the Arkansas General Assembly passed Act 276, allowing the Commissioner of State Lands to accept donations of land for public use.

<doc id="334596" wikidata="Q770417" url="?curid=334596" title="Michael Foster (physiologist)">
<text>Sir Michael Foster (8 March 1836 – 29 January 1907) was an English physiologist. He was instrumental in organizing the Cambridge Biological School and acted as Secretary of the Royal Society.

==Biography==
Foster was born in Huntingdon, Huntingdonshire, in March 1836, the son of Michael Foster, FRCS. He was educated at Huntingdon Grammar school where he played cricket for the first eleven and was described as &quot;a capital cricketer&quot;, in his role as wicket-keeper batsman and University College School, London. After graduating in medicine in 1859, he began to practise in his native town, but in 1867 he returned to London as teacher of practical physiology at University College London, where two years afterwards he became professor. In 1870 he was appointed by Trinity College, Cambridge, to its praelectorship in physiology, and thirteen years later he became the first occupant of the newly created chair of physiology in the university, holding it till 1903. One of his most famous students at Cambridge was Charles Scott Sherrington who went on to win the Nobel Prize in 1932.

He married first, in 1864, Georgina Edmonds, daughter of Cyrus Read Edmonds. Following her death in 1869, he married secondly, in 1872, Margaret Rust, daughter of George Rust, JP, of Huntingdon. He lived at Nine Wells House, Great Shelford in the Gog Magog Hills opposite his friend and fellow physiologist W H Gaskell.

==Career==
He excelled as a teacher and administrator, and had a very large share in the organization and development of the Cambridge biological school. From 1881 to 1903 he was one of the secretaries of the Royal Society, and in that capacity exercised a wide influence on the study of biology in Britain. In the 1899 Birthday Honours, he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), and served as president of the British Association at its meeting at Dover in September 1899.

Foster was elected to represent the University of London in parliament in a by-election in February 1900, and returned unopposed in the 1900 general election held later the same year. He stood for the Liberal Unionist Party, and though returned as a Unionist, his political action was not to be dictated by party considerations, and he gravitated towards Liberalism. He played no prominent part in parliament and indicated a desire to resign in 1902, but stayed on until the next election of 1906, where he stood for re-election but was defeated.

He was joint editor with E. Ray Lankester of &quot;The Scientific Memoirs of Thomas Henry Huxley&quot;. His chief writings were a &quot;Textbook of Physiology&quot; (1876), which became a standard work, and &quot;Lectures on the History of Physiology during the 16th, 17th and 18th Centuries&quot; (1901), which consisted of lectures delivered at the Cooper Medical College, San Francisco, in 1900. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1902.

He died suddenly in London in 1907.

==Irises==
Foster was also the binomial author of many iris species. One of many irises he introduced includes &quot;Iris lineata&quot; (or ), which was originally described and published in &quot;Gartenflora&quot; (1887), and later cited in &quot;Curtis&#x27;s Botanical Magazine&quot; (1888).

The species &quot;Iris fosteriana&quot; was named after Foster by Aitchison, in 1881.

The British Iris Society recognised his significant contributions with the introduction of the Foster Memorial Plaque in 1926. This is a medal made of sterling silver, hallmarked by Toye &amp; Co., London, one side cast in bas relief with an oval portrait of Foster, within a bed of irises, a banner above inscribed &#x27;In Memory Sir Michael Foster 1836-1907&#x27;. The other side named the award winner. Early awardees included, in 1927 George Yeld VMH, American John Wister and Frenchman Seraphin Mottet. In 1936 it was given to painter William Caparne. This award has continued into the twenty-first century.

The fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, the five inhabited U.S. territories, and the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands have taken their names from a wide variety of languages. The names of 24 states derive from indigenous languages of the Americas and one from Hawaiian. Of those that come from Native American languages, eight come from Algonquian languages, seven from Siouan languages (one of those via Miami-Illinois, which is an Algonquian language), three from Iroquoian languages, two from Muskogean languages, one from a Caddoan language, one from an Eskimo-Aleut language, one from a Uto-Aztecan language, and one from either an Athabaskan language or a Uto-Aztecan language.

Twenty other state names derive from European languages: seven come from Latin (mostly from Latinized forms of English personal names, one of those coming from Welsh), five from English, five from Spanish, and three from French (one of those via English). The source language/language family of the remaining five states is disputed or unclear: Arizona, Idaho, Maine, Oregon, and Rhode Island.

Of the fifty states, eleven are named after an individual person. Six of those are named in honor of European monarchs: the two Carolinas, the two Virginias, Georgia, and Louisiana. In addition, Maryland is named after Queen Henrietta Maria, queen consort of King Charles I of England, and New York after the then-Duke of York, who later became King James II of England. Over the years, several attempts have been made to name a state after one of the Founding Fathers or other great statesmen of U.S. history: the State of Franklin, the State of Jefferson (three separate attempts), the State of Lincoln (two separate attempts), and the State of Washington; in the end, only Washington materialized (Washington Territory was carved out of the Oregon Territory and renamed Washington in order to avoid confusion with the District of Columbia, which contains the city of Washington).

Several of the states that derive their names from names used for Native peoples have retained the plural ending in &quot;s&quot;: Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, and Texas. One common naming pattern has been as follows:


==State names==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
| ||data-sort-value=&quot;January 1, 1743&quot;| 1743 || Spanish || &quot;colorado&quot; || &#x27;Ruddy&#x27; or &#x27;red&#x27;, originally referring to the Colorado River.
| || April 15, 1696 || Eastern Algonquian, Mohegan-Pequot || &quot;quinnitukqut&quot; || From some Eastern Algonquian language of southern New England (perhaps Mahican), meaning &#x27;at the long tidal river&#x27;, after the Connecticut River. The name reflects Proto-Eastern-Algonquian &quot;*kwən-&quot;, &#x27;long&#x27;; &quot;*-əhtəkw&quot;, &#x27;tidal river&#x27;; and &quot;*-ənk&quot;, the locative suffix).
| || January 31, 1680 || French via English || &quot;de la Warr&quot; || After the Delaware River, which was named for Lord de la Warr (originally probably Norman French &quot;de la guerre&quot; or &quot;de la werre&quot;, &#x27;of the war&#x27;). Lord de la Warr was the first Governor-General of the Colony of Virginia.
| || April 2, 1513 || Spanish || &quot;(pascua) florida&quot; || &#x27;Flowery (Easter)&#x27; (to distinguish it from Christmastide, which was also called &quot;Pascua&quot;), in honor of its discovery by the Spanish during the Easter season.
| Georgia || October 3, 1674 || Latin via English (ultimately from Greek)|| &quot;Georgius&quot; ||The feminine Latin form of &quot;George&quot;, named after King George II of Great Britain. It was also a reference to Saint George, who is also the supposed namesake of the Eurasian country also called Georgia, whose name was derived from the Greek word &quot;georgos&quot;, meaning &#x27;husbandman&#x27; or &#x27;farmer&#x27;, from &quot;ge&quot; &#x27;earth&#x27; + &quot;ergon&quot; &#x27;work&#x27;.
| || December 29, 1879 || Hawaiian || &quot;Hawaiʻi&quot; || Either from Hawaiki, legendary homeland of the Polynesians (Hawaiki is believed to mean &#x27;place of the gods&#x27;), or named for Hawaiʻiloa, legendary discoverer of the Hawaiian Islands.
| rowspan=2| || rowspan=2| June 6, 1864 || Germanic || &quot;Idaho&quot; || Probably made up by George M. &quot;Doc&quot; Willing as a practical joke; originally claimed to have been derived from a word in a Native American language that meant &#x27;Gem of the Mountains&#x27;. The name was initially proposed for the Territory of Colorado until its origins were discovered. Years later it fell into common usage, and was proposed for the Territory of Idaho instead.
|| Plains Apache || &quot;ídaahę́&quot; || Possibly from the Plains Apache word for &#x27;enemy&#x27; (&quot;ídaahę́&quot;), which was used to refer to the Comanches.
| || March 24, 1793 || Algonquian, Miami-Illinois via French || &quot;ilenweewa&quot; || The state is named for the French adaptation of an Algonquian language (perhaps Miami-Illinois) word apparently meaning &#x27;speaks normally&#x27; (cf. Miami-Illinois &quot;ilenweewa&quot;, Ojibwe &lt;ilinoüek&gt;, Proto-Algonquian &quot;*elen-&quot;, &#x27;ordinary&#x27;, and &quot;-we·&quot;, &#x27;to speak&#x27;), referring to the Illiniwek (Illinois).
| || December 2, 1794 || Latin (ultimately from Proto-Indo-Iranian) || &quot;indiāna&quot; || &#x27;Land of the Indians&#x27;. The names &quot;Indians&quot; and &quot;India&quot; come, via Latin, Greek, Old Persian and Sanskrit, from Proto-Indo-Iranian &quot;*sindhu-&quot;, which originally referred to the Indus River.
| || August 31, 1818 || Dakota, Chiwere via French || &quot;ayúxba&quot;/&quot;ayuxwe&quot; via &quot;Aiouez&quot; || Via French &quot;Aiouez&quot;, and named after the Iowa tribe. This demonym has no further known etymology, though some give it the meaning &#x27;sleepy ones&#x27;.
| || May 12, 1832 || Kansa via French || &quot;kką:ze&quot; via &quot;Cansez&quot; || Named after the Kansas River, which in turn was named after the Kaw or Kansas tribe. The name seems to be connected to the idea of &quot;wind&quot;.
| || April 28, 1728 || Iroquoian || (see &quot;Meaning and notes&quot;) || Originally referring to the Kentucky River. While some sources say the etymology is uncertain, most agree on a meaning of &#x27;(on) the meadow&#x27; or &#x27;(on) the prairie&#x27; (cf. Mohawk &quot;kenhtà:ke,&quot; Seneca &quot;gëdá’geh&quot; (phonemic ), &#x27;at the field&#x27;).
| || July 18, 1787 || French (ultimately from Frankish) || &quot;Louisiane&quot; || After King Louis XIV of France. The name Louis itself comes from Frankish &quot;hluda&quot;, &#x27;heard of, famous&#x27; (cf. loud) + &quot;wiga&quot;, &#x27;war&#x27;.
| rowspan=3| || rowspan=3| October 13, 1729 || English || &quot;main&quot; || A common historical etymology is that the name refers to the mainland, as opposed to the coastal islands.
|| French || &quot;Maine&quot;|| After the French province of Maine.
|| English || &quot;(Broad)mayne&quot; || A more recent proposal is that the state was named after the English village of Broadmayne, which was the family estate of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the colony&#x27;s founder.
| || January 18, 1691 || English (ultimately from Hebrew) || &quot;Myriam&quot; || After Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of King Charles I of England. The name &quot;Mary&quot; originally meant &#x27;bitterness&#x27; or &#x27;rebelliousness&#x27; in Hebrew, and could also have come from the Egyptian word for &#x27;beloved&#x27; or &#x27;love&#x27;.
| || June 4, 1665 || Eastern Algonquian, Massachusett || &quot;muhsachuweesut&quot; || Plural of &quot;muswachusut&quot;, meaning &#x27;near the great little-mountain&#x27; or &#x27;at the great hill&#x27;, which is usually identified as Great Blue Hill on the border of Milton and Canton, Massachusetts (cf. the Narragansett name &quot;Massachusêuck&quot;).
| || October 28, 1811 || Ojibwe via French || ᒥᔑᑲᒥ (&quot;mishigami&quot;) || &#x27;Large water&#x27; or &#x27;large lake&#x27; (in Old Algonquin, &quot;*meshi-gami&quot;).
| || April 21, 1821 || Dakota || &quot;mní sóta&quot; || &#x27;Cloudy water&#x27;, referring to the Minnesota River.
| || March 9, 1800 || Ojibwe via French || ᒥᓯᓰᐱ (&quot;misi-ziibi&quot;) || &#x27;Great river&#x27;, after the Mississippi River.
| || September 7, 1805 || Miami-Illinois via French || &quot;wimihsoorita&quot; || &#x27;Dugout canoe&#x27;. The Missouri tribe was noteworthy among the Illinois for their dugout canoes, and so was referred to as the &quot;wimihsoorita&quot;, &#x27;one who has a wood boat [dugout canoe]&#x27;.
| || November 1, 1860 || Spanish || &quot;montaña&quot; || &#x27;Mountain&#x27;.
| || June 22, 1847 || Chiwere via French || &quot;ñįbraske&quot; || &#x27;Flattened water&#x27;, after the Platte River, which used to be known as the Nebraska River. Due to the flatness of the plains, flooding of the river would inundate the region with a flat expanse of water.
| || February 9, 1845 || Spanish || &quot;nevada&quot; || &#x27;Snow-covered&#x27;, after the Sierra Nevada (&#x27;snow-covered mountains&#x27;).
| || August 27, 1692 || English (ultimately from Old English) || &quot;Hampshire&quot; || After the county of Hampshire in England, whose name is derived from the original name for its largest city, Southampton, that being &quot;Hamtun&quot;, which is an Old English word that roughly translates to &#x27;Village-Town&#x27;.
| || April 2, 1669 || English (ultimately from Old Norse) || &quot;Jersey&quot; || After Jersey, the largest of the British Channel Islands and the birthplace of one of the colony&#x27;s two co-founders, Sir George Carteret. The Latin name Caesarea was also applied to the colony of New Jersey as Nova Caesarea, because the Roman name of the island was thought to have been Caesarea. The name &quot;Jersey&quot; most likely comes from the Norse name &quot;Geirrsey&quot;, meaning &#x27;Geirr&#x27;s Island&#x27;. 
| || November 1, 1859 || Nahuatl via Spanish || &quot;Mēxihco&quot; via &quot;Nuevo México&quot; || From Spanish &quot;Nuevo México&quot;. The name Mexico comes from Nahuatl &quot;Mēxihca&quot; (), which referred to the Aztec people who founded the city of Tenochtitlan. Its literal meaning is unknown, though many possibilities have been proposed, such as that the name comes from the god Metztli.
| New York || October 15, 1680 || English || &quot;York&quot; || After the Duke of York (later King James II of England). Named by King Charles II of England, James II&#x27;s brother. The name &quot;York&quot; is derived from its Latin name &quot;Eboracum&quot; (via Old English &quot;Eoforwic&quot; and then Old Norse Jórvík), apparently borrowed from Brythonic Celtic &quot;*eborakon&quot;, which probably meant &#x27;Yew-Tree Estate&#x27;. 
| || June 30, 1686 || Latin via English (ultimately from Frankish) || &quot;Carolus&quot; via &quot;Carolana&quot; || After King Charles I of England and his son, King Charles II of England. The name Charles itself is derived from Frankish &quot;karl&quot;, &#x27;man, husband&#x27;.
| || November 2, 1867 || Sioux/Dakota || &quot;dakhóta&quot; || &#x27;Ally&#x27; or &#x27;friend&#x27;, after the Dakota tribe.
| || April 19, 1785 || Seneca via French || &quot;ohi:yo’&quot; || &#x27;Large creek&#x27;, originally the name of both the Ohio River and Allegheny River. Often incorrectly translated as &#x27;beautiful river&#x27;, due to a French mistranslation.
| || September 5, 1842 || Choctaw || &quot;okla&quot; + &quot;homa&quot; || Devised as a rough translation of &#x27;Indian Territory&#x27;. In Choctaw, &quot;okla&quot; means &#x27;people&#x27;, &#x27;tribe&#x27;, or &#x27;nation&#x27;, and &quot;homa-&quot; means &#x27;red&#x27;, thus &#x27;red people&#x27;.
| || 1765 || Unknown || Disputed || Disputed meaning. First named by Major Robert Rogers in a petition to King George III.
| || March 8, 1650 || Welsh and Latin || &quot;Penn&quot; + &quot;silvania&quot; || &#x27;Penn&#x27;s woods&#x27;, after Admiral William Penn, the father of its founder William Penn. Pennsylvania is the only state that shares part of its name with its founder. The name &quot;Penn&quot; comes from the Welsh word for &#x27;head&#x27;.
| rowspan=2 | || rowspan=2 | February 3, 1680 || Dutch || &quot;roodt eylandt&quot; || &#x27;Red island&#x27;, referring to Aquidneck Island. The Modern Dutch form of the phrase is &#x27;rood eiland&#x27;.
|| Greek || Ρόδος (&quot;Ródos&quot;) || For a resemblance to the island of Rhodes in the Aegean Sea.
| || November 12, 1687 || Latin via English (ultimately from Frankish) || &quot;Carolus&quot; via &quot;Carolana&quot; || After King Charles I of England and his son, King Charles II of England. The name Charles itself is derived from Frankish &quot;karl&quot;, &#x27;man, husband&#x27;.
| || November 2, 1867 || Sioux/Dakota || &quot;dakhóta&quot; || &#x27;Ally&#x27; or &#x27;friend&#x27;, after the Dakota tribe.
| || May 24, 1747 || Cherokee || ᏔᎾᏏ (&quot;tanasi&quot;) || Tanasi (in Cherokee: ᏔᎾᏏ) was the name of a Cherokee village; the meaning is unknown.
| || June 30, 1827 || Caddo via Spanish || &quot;táyshaʔ&quot; via &quot;Tejas&quot; || &#x27;Friend&#x27;, used by the Caddo to refer the larger Caddo nation (in opposition to enemy tribes). The name was borrowed into Spanish as &quot;texa&quot;, plural &quot;texas&quot;, and was used to refer to the Nabedache people (and later to the Caddo Nation in general). When the Spanish decided to convert the Nabedache to Catholicism, they constructed &quot;La Misión de San Francisco de los Texas&quot;, which later came to be used in naming the Viceroyalty of New Spain’s province.
| rowspan=2| || rowspan=2| December 20, 1877 || Apache via Spanish || &quot;yúdah&quot; via &quot;yuta&quot; || From the Spanish designation for the Ute people, &quot;yuta&quot;, in turn perhaps a borrowing from Western Apache &quot;yúdah&quot;, meaning &#x27;high&#x27;, sometimes incorrectly translated as &#x27;people of the mountains&#x27;.
|| Ute via Spanish|| &quot;noochee&quot; via &quot;yuta&quot; || From the Ute&#x27;s self-designation , plural , as suggested by J. P. Harrington, though this etymology is disputed.
|-
| || September 27, 1721 || French || &quot;vert&quot; + &quot;mont&quot; || &#x27;Green mount&#x27; or &#x27;green mountain&#x27;; &quot;vert&quot; in French means &#x27;green&#x27;, and &quot;mont&quot; means &#x27;mount&#x27; or &#x27;mountain&#x27;. However, in French, &#x27;green mountain&#x27; would actually be written &quot;mont vert&quot;.
| || 1584 || Latin || &quot;Virginia&quot; || &#x27;Country of the Virgin&#x27;, after Elizabeth I of England, who was known as the &quot;Virgin Queen&quot; because she never married.
| Washington || February 22, 1872 || English || &quot;Washington&quot; || After George Washington, whose surname was in turn derived from the town of Washington in historic County Durham, England. The etymology of the town&#x27;s name is disputed, but agreed to be ultimately Old English.
| || September 1, 1831 || Latin || &quot;Virginia&quot; || The western, transmontane counties of Virginia, which separated from Virginia during the American Civil War. See Virginia, above.
| || February 5, 1822 || Miami-Illinois via French || &quot;Meeskohsinki&quot; via &quot;Ouisconsin(k)&quot; || Originally spelled &quot;Mescousing&quot; by the French, and later corrupted to &quot;Ouisconsin&quot;. It likely derives from a Miami-Illinois word &quot;Meskonsing&quot;, meaning &#x27;it lies red&#x27; or &#x27;river running through a red place&#x27;. It may also come from the Ojibwe term &quot;miskwasiniing&quot;, &#x27;red-stone place&#x27;.
| || August 14, 1877 || Munsee/Delaware || &quot;xwé:wamənk&quot; || &#x27;At the big river flat&#x27;; the name was transplanted westward from the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania.

<text>Charles Stuart Calverley (; 22 December 1831 – 17 February 1884) was an English poet and wit. He was the literary father of what has been called &quot;the university school of humour&quot;.

==Early life==
He was born at Martley, Worcestershire, and given the name Charles Stuart Blayds. In 1852, his father, the Rev. Henry Blayds, resumed the old family name of Calverley, which his grandfather had exchanged for Blayds in 1807. Charles went up to Balliol College, Oxford, from Harrow School in 1850, and was soon known in Oxford as the most daring and high-spirited undergraduate of his time. He was a universal favourite, a delightful companion, a brilliant scholar and the playful enemy of all &quot;dons.&quot; In 1851 he won the Chancellor&#x27;s prize for Latin verse, but it is said that the entire exercise was written in an afternoon, when his friends had locked him into his rooms, refusing to let him out until he had finished what they were confident would prove the prize poem.

A year later, to avoid the consequences of a college escapade (he had been expelled from Oxford), like his father, he too changed his name to Calverley and moved to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Here he was again successful in Latin verse, the only undergraduate to have won the Chancellor&#x27;s prize at both universities. In 1856 he took second place in the first class in the Classical Tripos.

==Later life==
He was elected fellow of Christ&#x27;s (1858), published &quot;Verses and Translations&quot; in 1862, and was called to the bar in 1865. Injuries sustained in a skating accident prevented him from following a professional career, and during the last years of his life he was an invalid. He died of Bright&#x27;s disease.

==Works==

Nowadays he is best-known (at least in Cambridge, his adoptive home) as the author of the &quot;Ode to Tobacco&quot; (1862) which is to be found on a bronze plaque in Rose Crescent, on the wall of what used to be Bacon&#x27;s the tobacconist. It concludes:

:Cats may have had their goose
:Cooked by tobacco juice;
:Still, why deny its use
:Thoughtfully taken?
:We&#x27;re not as tabbies are;
:Smith, take a fresh cigar!
:Jones, the tobacco jar!
:Here&#x27;s to thee, Bacon!&quot;

His poem &quot;Beer&quot; is also notable, for its light mocking of Greek gods who, surprisingly, did not drink beer, and continues to extol:

:&quot;O Beer! O Hodgson, Guinness, Allsopp, Bass!
:Names that should be on every infant&#x27;s tongue!&quot;

His &quot;Translations into English and Latin&quot; appeared in 1866; his &quot;Theocritus translated into English Verse&quot; in 1869; &quot;Fly Leaves&quot; in 1872; and &quot;Literary Remains&quot; in 1885.

His &quot;Complete Works&quot;, with a biographical notice by Walter Joseph Sendall, a contemporary at Christ&#x27;s and his brother-in-law, appeared in 1901.

George W. E. Russell said of him:He was a true poet; he was one of the most graceful scholars that Cambridge ever produced; and all his exuberant fun was based on a broad and strong foundation of Greek, Latin and English literature.

<text>Hartley Coleridge, possibly David Hartley Coleridge (19 September 1796 – 6 January 1849), was an English poet, biographer, essayist, and teacher. He was the eldest son of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. His sister Sara Coleridge was a poet and translator, and his brother Derwent Coleridge was a scholar and author. Hartley was named after the philosopher David Hartley.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hartley was born in Clevedon, a small village near Bristol. His father mentions Hartley in several poems, including the well-known &quot;Frost at Midnight&quot;, where he addresses him as his &quot;babe so beautiful&quot;, and in his &quot;The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem&quot;, both of which are concerned with young Hartley&#x27;s future.

In the autumn of 1800 Samuel Taylor Coleridge moved his wife and young son Hartley to the Lake District. They took a home in the vale of Derwentwater, on the bank of the Greta River, about a mile away from Greta Hall, Keswick, the future home of the poet Robert Southey, which was then being built. Hartley spent his early years in the care of Robert Southey at Greta Hall, which possessed the best library in the neighbourhood.

Hartley&#x27;s brother Derwent wrote the following about Hartley&#x27;s time at Greta Hall:
&quot;The unlimited indulgence with which he was treated at Greta Hall, tended, without doubt, to strengthen the many and strong peculiarities of his nature, and may perhaps have contributed to that
waywardness and want of control, from which in later-life he suffered so deeply.&quot;

===Education===

Hartley received his early education from his father. In 1807 he was taken by his father and William Wordsworth to Coleorton in North West Leicestershire, and then to London. Here he visited the London theatres, and the Tower of London with Walter Scott. He was also introduced to the study of chemistry by Humphry Davy.

Hartley spent the next eight years in constant companionship with his younger brother Derwent, at home and at school. Beginning in the summer of 1808 they attended school as day-scholars at Ambleside, under the tutelage of the Rev. John Dawes. During their time at the school they resided in Clappersgate. Their fellow students included the sons of their father&#x27;s friend, the poet Charles Lloyd. Hartley and Derwent lived in the home of an elderly woman, and enjoyed total freedom in their after-school hours. Hartley, who had no aptitude for sports, spent much of his time reading and taking walks by himself, or telling stories. He had one close friend at the time, a boy named Robert Jameson, not a fellow student, to whom he afterwards addressed a series of sonnets.

Somewhere along the way, Hartley conceived the idea of an underground stream of water that would eventually erupt onto the surface, creating a mighty river that would soon attract merchants and land developers, leading to the formation of a new island-continent. He called this imaginary paracosm &quot;Ejuxria&quot;, and laid out its geography and history with great care, explaining everything to Derwent as he went along. Derwent believed that Hartley kept up Ejuxria into adulthood.

In his time at the school, Hartley was in constant contact with William Wordsworth and his family. He pursued his studies of English in Wordsworth&#x27;s library at Allan Bank in Grasmere. His privilege of studying in the Wordsworth library was continued after the Wordsworth family moved to Rydal Mount.

He went to Oxford in 1815, as a scholar of Merton College. From 1816 to 1820 he was in receipt of an exhibition funded from the bequest of James Wood administered by the Worshipful Company of Bowyers of the City of London. Derwent Coleridge made this comment about his brother&#x27;s time at Oxford:
Though far from a destructive in politics, he was always keenly alive to what he supposed to be the evils and abuses of the existing state of things both in Church and State, while he remained constant in his allegiance to what he believed to be the essentials of both... On all subjects he spoke his mind, often, through whim or impatience, more than his mind, freely, without regard to consequences.
On a vacation in 1818 Hartley met the poet Chauncy Hare Townshend, who said the following of him:
I cannot easily convey to you the impression of interest which he made on my mind at that time. There was something so wonderfully original in his method of expressing himself, that on me, then a young man, and only cognisant externally of the prose of life, his sayings, all stamped with the impress of poetry, produced an effect analogous to that which the mountains of Cumberland, and the scenery of the North, were working on my southern-born eye and imagination.

He had inherited much of his father&#x27;s character, and his lifestyle was such that, although he was successful in gaining a fellowship at Oriel College, at the close of the probationary year (1820) he was judged to have forfeited it, mainly on the grounds of intemperance. The authorities would not reverse their decision; but they awarded him a gift of £300. This incident deeply saddened his father, who did everything he could to try to get the decision reversed, but without success. Hartley suffered from a dependency on alcohol for the rest of his life.

===Career===
He then spent two years in London, where he wrote short poems for the &quot;London Magazine&quot;. It was around this time that he composed the fragment &quot;Prometheus&quot;, which his father regarded with much interest. His next step was to become a partner in a school at Ambleside, at the suggestion of his family and friends, a venture which he himself carried out with reluctance, but this scheme failed. After a struggle of four or five years, Hartley abandoned teaching, and moved to Grasmere.

From 1826 to 1831, he wrote occasionally in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, to which he was introduced by his friend, John Wilson. His contributions to this periodical form part of the general collection of his &quot;Essays&quot;.

In 1830 a Leeds publisher, F. E. Bingley, made a contract with him to write biographies of Yorkshire and Lancashire worthies. These were afterwards republished under the title of &quot;Biographia Borealis&quot; (1833) and &quot;Worthies of Yorkshire and Lancashire&quot; (1836). Bingley also printed a volume of his poems in 1833, and Coleridge lived in his house until the contract came to an end through the bankruptcy of the publisher.
From this time, except for two short periods in 1837 and 1838 when he acted as master at Sedbergh School, he lived quietly at Grasmere and (1840–1849) Rydal, spending his time in study and wanderings about the countryside. His figure was as familiar as Wordsworth&#x27;s, and he made many friends among the locals. In 1834 he lost his father. Hartley made the following comment about his father&#x27;s death in a letter to his mother:
... though I cannot say that I was much surprised, yet so little had I prepared my mind for the loss, that it fell upon me as the fulfilment of an unbelieved prophecy: and even yet, though I know it, I hardly believe it. I do not feel fatherless. I often find my mind disputing with itself—What would my father think of this? and when the recollection awakes, that I have no father, it appears more like a possible evil than an actual bereavement.

In 1839 he brought out his edition of Philip Massinger and John Ford, with biographies of both dramatists. The closing decade of Coleridge&#x27;s life was wasted in what he himself called &quot;the woeful impotence of weak resolve&quot;. On the death of his mother in 1845, he was placed, by means of an annuity on his life, on a footing of complete independence, but he lived for only three more years.

Hartley Coleridge&#x27;s literary reputation chiefly rests on his works of criticism, on his &quot;Prometheus&quot;, an unfinished lyric drama, and on his sonnets (a form which suited his particular skills). &quot;Essays and Marginalia, and Poems&quot;, with a memoir by his brother Derwent, appeared in 1851.

<text>Little Marvel was a United Kingdom record label which issued small (5 3/8 - 6 inch) gramophone records during the 1920s. The label was owned by the Vocalion record company (known in the United Kingdom as the Aeolian Co, Ltd.), and was part of a competitive market for small, inexpensive discs existing at the time in the United Kingdom and Germany. Little Marvel records were sold exclusively at UK Woolworth&#x27;s chain stores at a retail price of 6d (sixpence). The Woolworth&#x27;s logo appeared on the label of the discs.

The first issues appeared in 1921, at select Woolworth&#x27;s locations, but in 1923 the product became available at all Woolworth&#x27;s stores.

As with many records of this type, the recording artists are not credited. The labels on the records mention only the song title, the style of music (e.g. foxtrot, waltz), and in some cases the name of the songwriter or composer. The records were popular not only for their price, but also because of the peppiness of the performances. In addition to popular fare, some children&#x27;s discs were also issued. Most issues paired a popular number which was under copyright and for which royalties were paid, while the other side was a recording of a title under public domain, or with the copyright controlled by the record company.

<doc id="334626" wikidata="Q1143785" url="?curid=334626" title="Telephone booth">
<text>A telephone booth, telephone kiosk, telephone call box, telephone box or public call box is a tiny structure furnished with a payphone and designed for a telephone user&#x27;s convenience; typically the user steps into the booth and closes the booth door while using the payphone inside.

In the United States and Canada, &quot;telephone booth&quot; (or &quot;phone booth&quot;) is the commonly used term for the structure, while in the Commonwealth of Nations (particularly the United Kingdom and Australia), it is a &quot;phone box&quot;.

Such a booth usually has lighting, a door to provide privacy, and windows to let others know if the booth is in use. The booth may be furnished with a printed directory of local telephone numbers, and in a formal setting, such as a hotel, may be furnished with paper and pen and even a seat. An outdoor booth may be made of metal and plastic to withstand the elements and heavy use, while an indoor booth (known as a silence cabinet) may have more elaborate design and furnishings. Most outdoor booths feature the name and logo of the telephone service provider.

==History==


The world&#x27;s first telephone box called &quot;Fernsprechkiosk&quot;, was opened on 12 January 1881 at Potsdamer Platz, Berlin. To use it, one had to buy paper tickets called Telefonbillet which allowed for a few minutes of talking time. In 1899, it was replaced by a coin-operated telephone.

William Gray is credited with inventing the coin payphone in the United States in 1889, and George A. Long was its developer.

In the UK, the creation of a national network of telephone boxes commenced in 1920, beginning with the &quot;K1&quot; model which was made of concrete; however, the city of Kingston upon Hull is noted for having its individual phone service, Kingston Communications, with cream coloured phone boxes, as opposed to classic royal red in the rest of Britain. The Post Office was forced into allowing a less strident grey with red glazing bars scheme for areas of natural and architectural beauty. Ironically, some of these areas that have preserved their telephone boxes have now painted them red.

In the 1940, at military bases during WWII, outdoor booths started to appear. But in general they were most commonly placed indoors, as they were mostly made of wood and didn&#x27;t handle exposure to the elements well. This changed in 1954, when the Airlight outdoor telephone booth was introduced. Being made of glass and aluminium, they were designed especially for the outdoors and originally intended to serve motorists traveling on the highway.

==Design==

Starting in the 1970s, pay telephones were less commonly placed in booths in the United States. In many cities where they were once common, telephone booths have now been almost completely replaced by non-enclosed pay phones. In the United States, this replacement was caused, at least in part, by an attempt to make the pay telephones more accessible to disabled people. However, in the United Kingdom, telephones remained in booths more often than the non-enclosed setup. Although still fairly common, the number of phone boxes has declined sharply in Britain since the late 1990s due to the rise in use of mobile phones.

Many locations that provide pay-phones mount the phones on kiosks rather than in booths—this relative lack of privacy and comfort discourages lengthy calls in high-demand areas such as airports.

Special equipment installed in some telephone booths allows a caller to use a computer, a portable fax machine, or a telecommunications device for the deaf.

The Jabbrrbox, an enclosed structure for installation in open plan offices, was inspired by the telephone booth.

==Cultural impact==

The ubiquity of the phone booth led to its depiction in fiction. In comic books published by DC Comics, the telephone booth is occasionally the place where reporter Clark Kent discards his street clothing and transforms into the costumed superhero Superman. Some films and television series have reused or parodied this plot device. The 1965–1970 television series &quot;Get Smart&quot; used a phone booth, among other devices, as a secure means of entering CONTROL headquarters. The 2002 film &quot;Phone Booth&quot; takes place almost entirely in a telephone booth; a 2023 retrospective article notes that &quot;the obsolescence is to the film&#x27;s advantage.&quot;

The 1986 comedy film &quot;Clockwise&quot; features John Cleese&#x27;s character vandalising a phone in a booth in frustration after it malfunctions. The scene played on the public perception in Britain at the time that telephone booths were frequently out of order.

== Privacy ==
Phone booths have been subject to wireless surveillance by law enforcement. For example, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case of &quot;Katz v. United States&quot; involved the Constitutional question of whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) could install a listening device outside of the booth.

==Recent developments==


===Wireless services===
The increasing use of mobile phones has led to a decreased demand for payphones, while the increasing use of laptops is leading to a new kind of service: in 2003, service provider Verizon announced that it would begin offering wireless computer connectivity in the vicinity of its phone booths in Manhattan. In 2006, the Verizon Wi-Fi telephone booth service was discontinued in favor of the more expensive Verizon Wireless&#x27; EVDO system.

Wireless access is motivating telephone companies to place wireless stations at locations that have traditionally hosted telephone booths, but stations are also appearing in new kinds of locations such as libraries, cafés, and trains. Phone booths have been slowly disappearing with the growth in use of mobile phones.

===Vandalism===
A rise in vandalism has prompted several companies to manufacture simpler booths with extremely durable pay phones.

===Withdrawal of services===
Pay phones may still be used by mobile/cellular phone users if their phone become unusable, is stolen, or for other emergency uses. These uses may make the complete disappearance of pay phones in the near future less likely.

====Australia====
Under the Universal Service Obligation, the Government of Australia legally requires Telstra to ensure standard phone services and payphones are &quot;reasonably accessible to all people in Australia&quot;. Some communities, particularly in remote regional areas, rely on payphones, as well as people who do not have access to a mobile phone.

At their peak in the early 1990s, there were more than 80,000 public phone boxes across the country. By June 30, 2016, according to the Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority there were about 24,000 payphones across Australia. On August 3, 2021, with 15,000 public phones remaining across Australia, Telstra announced that all calls to fixed line and mobile phones within Australia from public phones would become free of charge, and that it had no plans to further eliminate public phones.

====Belgium====
In Belgium, majority state-owned telco Belgacom took the last remaining phone booths out of service in June 2015.

====Czechia====
In June 2021 the last phone booth in Czechia was closed and dismantled.

====Denmark====
In December 2017 the last three public telephone booths in Denmark had their telephones removed. They were situated in the town of Aarhus.

====Finland====

By 2007, Finnet companies and TeliaSonera Finland had discontinued their public telephones, and the last remaining operator Elisa Oyj did so early the same year.

====France====
According to Orange CEO, Stéphane Richard, there were only 26 public phone booths still operating in France as of 2021. The &quot;Macron law&quot; of 2015 ended Orange mandatory maintenance of a public phone booth network, its decline in use being caused by the cell phones era. These are, by law, maintained in rural area where there is no cell phone service. Consequently, they are removed once the area is properly covered by at least one mobile phone operator.
====Ireland====
Eir, the Universal Service Obligation carrier with regard to payphones, has been systematically removing payphones which fall under the minimum requirement for retention, of a rolling average of one minute of usage a day over six months. 

As of June 2019, 456 locations retained payphones (with none in the entirety of County Leitrim); this was down from 1,320 in March 2014.

====Italy====
In May 2023 AGCOM established that TIM no longer has the obligation to guarantee the availability of telephone booths, with the exception of &quot;places of social importance&quot;, such as hospitals (with at least ten beds), prisons, and barracks with at least fifty occupants. TIM will also be able to decommission booths in mountain refuges, while ensuring access to the mobile telephone network. AGCOM declared that 99.2% of public telephones are already covered by a mobile network with at least 2G technology (May 2023). In September 2023 over 90,000 booths which do not fall into the above-mentioned exceptions began being removed.

====Jordan====
In 2004, Jordan became the first country in the world not to have telephone booths generally available. The mobile/cellular phone penetration in that country has become so high that telephone booths had been rarely used for years. The two private payphone service companies, namely ALO and JPP, closed down.

====Norway====
The last functioning phone box in Norway was taken out of service in June 2016. However, 100 phone boxes have been preserved around the country and are protected under cultural heritage laws.

====Sweden====
The first telephone booth in Sweden was erected in 1890. In 1981 there were 44,000, but by 2013, only 1,200 remained, with the removal of the last one in 2015. A survey showed that in 2013, only 1% of the population in Sweden had used one during the previous year.

====United Kingdom====

The red telephone kiosk is recognised as a British icon and the BT Group still hold intellectual property rights in the designs of many of the telephone boxes, including registered trademark rights.
BT is steadily removing public telephone kiosks from the streets of the UK. It is permitted to remove a kiosk without consultation provided that there is another kiosk within walking distance. In other cases, it is required to comply with Ofcom rules in consultation with the local authority. Some decommissioned red telephone boxes have been converted for other uses with the permission of BT Group, such as housing small community libraries or automated external defibrillators.

====United States====

Beginning in the 1990s, many large cities began instituting restrictions on where pay phones could be placed, under the belief that they facilitated crime. In 1999, there were approximately 2 million phone booths in the United States. Only five percent of those remained in service by 2018. In 2008, AT&amp;T began withdrawing pay phone support citing profitability, and a few years later Verizon also left the pay phone market. In 2015, a phone booth in Prairie Grove, Arkansas was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. New phone booth installations do sometimes occur, including the installation of a phone booth at Eaton Rapid&#x27;s city hall.

In 2018, about a fifth of America&#x27;s 100,000 remaining pay phones were in New York, according to the FCC. Only four phone booths remain in New York City, all on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side; the rest have been converted into WiFi hotspots. Incoming calls are no longer available, and outgoing calls are now free. In February 2020, the city confirmed that despite a plan to remove dozens of pay phones, the iconic booths would continue to be maintained.

===Advertising===
Many telephone boxes in the United Kingdom are now used for advertisements, bearing posters, with the development of &quot;StreetTalk&quot; by JCDecaux. This is in addition to the ST6 public telephone introduced in 2007 which is designed to feature a phone on one side and a JCDecaux-owned advertising space on the otherside. The advertising pays for the cost of maintaining the phone.

In 2018, the UK Local Government Association drew attention to &quot;Trojan&quot; telephone boxes. These are telephone boxes whose main purpose is advertising. A loophole in planning law allows these to be erected without planning permission and the LGA is seeking to close this loophole.

<text>Eric Dwayne Collins (born October 8, 1967) better known by his stage name RBX (standing for &quot;Reality Born Unknown&quot;), is an American rapper from Long Beach, California.

==Early life and education==
Collins was born and raised in Long Beach, California. After graduating Long Beach Polytechnical High School, he received a scholarship to play college football for UNLV, alongside future Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight. His football career was cut short after sustaining a torn ACL, which helped push him to pursue a career in music. Contrary to popular belief, Collins is not related to funk legend Bootsy Collins, although the two are close friends. 

==Career==

===1992–1995: Death Row Records===
RBX joined Death Row Records in 1992 with his cousins Snoop Dogg and Daz Dillinger. A former college student and retail manager, Collins declined to sign blank contracts like his Death Row brethren. His tenure on the label would be brief but memorable. Having made commanding cameos on &quot;The Chronic&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Doggystyle&quot; in 1993. RBX left the label in 1994 and signed with the lesser known Premeditated Entertainment. He released &quot;The RBX Files&quot; in 1995, his debut solo album that was produced by former Chronic production team member Greg &quot;Gregski&quot; Royal.

The album abandoned the popular West Coast G-Funk style in favor of a &quot;gritty, dungeon-like&quot; sound more associated with New York. The single &quot;A.W.O.L.&quot; was an attack on Death Row, Suge Knight, Dre, and others, with X comparing the dubious business practices there to the days of Ruthless Records, Jerry Heller, and Eazy-E. In a YouTube interview with VladTV he talked about an altercation over food between him and Suge Knight, in which Knight pulled out a gun.

===1996–2000: Aftermath Entertainment===
In 1996, RBX visited Dr. Dre at home and apologized for his harsh words on record and in magazines and immediately signed to Dre&#x27;s new Aftermath label. He was featured on the 1996 compilation &quot;Dr. Dre Presents... The Aftermath&quot; on the solo song &quot;Blunt Time&quot; and the group track &quot;East Coast/West Coast Killaz&quot; with KRS-One, B-Real and Nas, with both songs produced by Dre. Lost in the infamous reshuffling of Aftermath in 1998, RBX once again went solo and released his follow up album &quot;No Mercy, No Remorse&quot; on an independent label in 1999. He reappeared with Aftermath to cameo on Eminem&#x27;s &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; in 2000.

===2022–present: &quot;Hibernation Shivers&quot;===
In 2022, RBX began work with Los Angeles based producers Sccit &amp; Siavash The Grouch on his comeback album &quot;Hibernation Shivers&quot;. The Labcabin Records release includes features from Spice-1, MC Eiht, Daz Dillinger, Fatlip, Project Pat, Ras Kass, Eligh, Cold 187um, Krayzie Bone, Butch Cassidy, Kurupt, Smoov-E &amp; more. On April 20, 2022, RBX assisted Fatlip with the release of a single for Fatlip’s album, “Torpor”, in the Sccit &amp; Siavash The Grouch produced song titled “Wake Up”. The single was accompanied by a music video, which was themed around the Los Angeles homeless epidemic. On July 7, 2023, RBX released the first single from “Hibernation Shivers”, titled “Nightstalker”. The single, which features Krayzie Bone, is a re-imagining of the infamous Los Angeles serial killer Richard Ramirez. On September 8, 2023, RBX released the second single from “Hibernation Shivers”, titled “Lets Ride”, which was led by a funky west coast groove reminiscent of golden era G-Funk. The single, featuring Sccit &amp; Klientel, got a video release on September 11, 2023. The “Hibernation Shivers” album was officially released on March 15, 2024 to critical acclaim, with AllHipHop referring to the album as a “masterpiece” while unveiling a new single &amp; video for the album titled “Hibernation” featuring Ras Kass.

<doc id="334634" wikidata="Q1825748" url="?curid=334634" title="Metasequoia">
<text>Metasequoia, or dawn redwood, is a genus of fast-growing coniferous trees, one of three species of conifers known as redwoods. The living species &quot;Metasequoia glyptostroboides&quot; is native to Lichuan county in Hubei province, China. Although the shortest of the redwoods, it grows to at least in height. Local villagers refer to the original tree from which most others derive as &quot;Shuǐshān&quot; (水杉), or &quot;water fir&quot;, which is part of a local shrine. Since its rediscovery in 1944, the dawn redwood has become a popular ornamental, with examples found in various parks in a variety of countries. 

Together with &quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot; (coast redwood) and &quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot; (giant sequoia) of California, &quot;Metasequoia&quot; is classified in the Cupressaceae subfamily Sequoioideae. &quot;M. glyptostroboides&quot; is the only living species in its genus, but three fossil species are known. Sequoioideae and several other genera have been transferred from the former family Taxodiaceae to Cupressaceae based on DNA analysis.

==Paleontology==
&quot;Metasequoia&quot; redwood fossils are known from many areas in the Northern Hemisphere; more than 20 fossil species have been named (some were even identified as the genus &quot;Sequoia&quot;), but are considered as just three species, &quot;M. foxii&quot;, &quot;M. milleri&quot;, and &quot;M. occidentalis&quot;. Fossils are known from the Cenomanian onwards. During the Paleocene and Eocene, extensive forests of &quot;Metasequoia&quot; occurred as far north as Strathcona Fiord on Ellesmere Island and sites on Axel Heiberg Island (northern Canada) at around 80° N latitude. &quot;Metasequoia&quot; was likely deciduous by this time. Given that the high latitudes in this period were warm and tropical, it is hypothesized that the deciduous trait evolved in response to the unusual light availability patterns, not to major seasonal variations in temperature. During three months in the summer, the sun would shine continuously, while three months of the winter would be complete darkness. It is also hypothesized that the change from evergreen to deciduous trait occurred before colonizing the high latitudes and was the reason &quot;Metasequoia&quot; was dominant in the north.

Large petrified trunks and stumps of the extinct &quot;Metasequoia occidentalis&quot; (formerly identified as &quot;Sequoia occidentalis&quot;) also make up the major portion of Tertiary fossil plant material in the badlands of western North Dakota.

The trees are well known from late Cretaceous to Miocene strata, but no fossils are known after that. Before its discovery, the taxon was believed to have become extinct during the Miocene; when it was discovered , it was heralded as a &quot;living fossil&quot;.

==Appearance==

The bark and foliage are similar to &quot;Sequoia&quot;, but &quot;Metasequoia&quot; is deciduous like &quot;Taxodium distichum&quot; (bald cypress), and, similarly, older specimens form wide buttresses on the lower trunk. It is a fast-growing tree to 130–150 feet (40–45 m) tall and 6 feet (2 m) in trunk diameter in cultivation so far (with the potential to grow even higher).

The leaves are opposite, 0.4–1.25 inches (1–3 cm.) long, and bright fresh green, turning foxy red-brown in fall. The pollen cones are 0.25 inch (6 mm) long, produced on long spikes in early spring; they are only produced on trees growing in regions with hot summers. The cones are globose to ovoid, 0.6–1.0 inches (1.5–2.5 cm.) in diameter with 16–28 scales, arranged in opposite pairs in four rows, each pair at right angles to the adjacent pair; they mature in about 8–9 months after pollination.

&quot;Metasequoia&quot; has experienced morphological stasis for the past 65 million years: the modern &quot;Metasequoia glyptostroboides&quot; appears identical to its late Cretaceous ancestors.

== History ==

The fossil of this genus was discovered by Shigeru Miki in 1939. In 1941, Miki published the description of the fossil plant which he gave the name &quot;Metasequoia&quot;. In the winter of the same year, a Chinese botanist Toh Gan (干铎) discovered an unusual big tree in Modaoxi (磨刀溪; presently, Moudao (谋道), in Lichuan County, Hubei). The locals called this tree shui-sha (水桫). Because it was winter, the tree already lost all its leaves, so no specimens were collected by Mr. Gan. In 1942, another botanist, Mr. Zhan Wang (王战) visited Modaoxi and collected living specimens. Mr. Wang believed this tree belonged to a known species &quot;Glyptostrobus pensilis&quot; (水松) and filed the specimens away. In 1945, Mr. Wang showed the specimens to botanist Wan Chun Cheng (郑万钧). Mr. Cheng determined that the tree did not belong to &quot;Glyptostrobus pensilis&quot;, but was a new species. Mr. Cheng then sent a specimen to prominent botanist Hu Xiansu, the director of Fan Memorial Institute of Biology. Hu, despite the chaos of war between China and Japan, was still keeping track of international botanic literature. Hu recognized the living specimen was of the same genus of Miki&#x27;s fossil genus &quot;&quot;Metasequoia&quot;&quot;. After more study, Hu and Cheng published the new species &quot;Metasequoia glyptostroboides&quot; (Hu et Cheng) in May 1948 in the Bulletin of Fan Memorial Institute of Biology. The discovery of a &quot;living fossil&quot; instantly attracted attention from botanists around the world. It was widely regarded as &quot;the greatest discovery of botany in 20th century&quot;. In 1948, the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, through the help of Hu and Cheng, funded an expedition by Chinese collectors to collect seeds. Soon after, seeds were distributed to various universities and arboreta worldwide for growth trials.

Presently, a number of natural &quot;Metasequoia&quot; populations exist in the hills and wetlands of Hubei&#x27;s Lichuan County. Most of them are small, with fewer than 30 trees each; however, the largest of them, in Xiaohe Valley, is estimated to consist of around 5,400 trees. A few trees are also said to exist in neighboring Hunan Province.

== &quot;Metasequoia&quot; in gardens, parks and streets ==

Dawn redwoods are fast-growing trees. They sometimes grow too large in smaller gardens under favorable conditions, but they can be a good choice for a wide range of larger gardens and parks. Although they live in wet sites in their native habitat they will also tolerate dry soils. Unlike most conifers, their deciduous habit means they do not cast much shade in winter. They are grown as street trees in London and elsewhere.

Strawberry Fields is a landscaped section in New York City&#x27;s Central Park dedicated to Beatle John Lennon. At the northern end of the lawns are three dawn redwood trees. There are several other dawn redwood trees in New York City, including one in the Liz Christy Garden, planted by Liz Christy herself in the 1970s, and a grove in the Brooklyn Botanical Garden.

<doc id="334639" wikidata="Q1967324" url="?curid=334639" title="Sluggish schizophrenia">
<text>Sluggish schizophrenia or slow progressive schizophrenia () was a diagnostic category used in the Soviet Union to describe what was claimed to be a form of schizophrenia characterized by a slowly progressive course; it was diagnosed even in patients who showed no symptoms of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, on the assumption that these symptoms would appear later. It was developed in the 1960s by Soviet psychiatrist Andrei Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, and was used exclusively in the USSR and several Eastern Bloc countries, until the fall of Communism starting in 1989. The diagnosis has long been discredited because of its scientific inadequacy and its use as a means of confining dissenters. It has never been used or recognized outside of the Eastern Bloc, or by international organizations such as the World Health Organization. It is considered a prime example of the political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union.

Sluggish schizophrenia was the most infamous of diagnoses used by Soviet psychiatrists, due to its usage against political dissidents. After being discharged from a hospital, persons diagnosed with sluggish schizophrenia were deprived of their civic rights, credibility and employability. The usage of this diagnosis has been internationally condemned.

In the Russian version of the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), which has long been used throughout present-day Russia, sluggish schizophrenia is no longer listed as a form of schizophrenia, but it is still included as a schizotypal disorder in section F21 of chapter V.

According to Sergei Jargin, the same Russian term &quot;vyalotekushchaya&quot; for sluggish schizophrenia continues to be used and is now translated in English summaries of articles not as &quot;sluggish&quot; but as &quot;slow progressive&quot;.

== Development of theory ==
The term &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot; was introduced in the Soviet Union in the 1930s by Dr. Grunia Sukhareva. Sukhareva first used the term in a 1933 article in which she described a type of schizophrenia that developed slowly in children beginning before puberty. Sukhareva&#x27;s term became a standard part of Soviet textbooks on schizophrenia in the 1940s. In the 1960s, Professor Andrei Snezhnevsky, the most prominent theorist of Soviet psychiatry and director of the Institute of Psychiatry of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, developed a novel classification of mental disorders postulating an original set of diagnostic criteria. Snezhnevsky and his colleagues who developed the concept were supported by Soviet psychiatrists Fedor Kondratev, Sergei Semyonov, and Yakov Frumkin. All were members of the &quot;Moscow school&quot; of psychiatry.

A majority of experts believe that the concept was developed under instructions from the Soviet secret service KGB and the Communist Party.

== Use against political dissidents ==

Psychiatric diagnoses such as sluggish schizophrenia were used in the USSR for political purposes; the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia was most frequently used for Soviet dissidents. Sluggish schizophrenia as a diagnostic category was created to facilitate the stifling of dissidents and was a root of self-deception among psychiatrists to placate their consciences when the doctors acted as a tool of oppression in the name of a political system. American psychiatrist Peter Breggin points out that the term &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot; was created to justify involuntary treatment of political dissidents with drugs normally used for psychiatric patients.

Critics implied that Snezhnevsky designed the Soviet model of schizophrenia (and this diagnosis) to make political dissent a mental illness.

St. Petersburg academic psychiatrist professor Yuri Nuller notes that the concept of Snezhnevsky&#x27;s school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors. The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders. It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia. Despite a number of its controversial premises, but in line with the traditions of then Soviet science, Snezhnevsky&#x27;s hypothesis immediately acquired the status of dogma, which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry. Snezhnevsky&#x27;s concept, with its dogmatism, proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis.

On the covert orders of the KGB, thousands of social and political reformers—Soviet dissidents—were incarcerated in mental hospitals after being labelled with diagnoses of sluggish schizophrenia. Snezhnevsky himself diagnosed, or was otherwise involved in, a series of famous dissident cases, and in dozens of cases he personally signed a commission decision on the legal insanity of dissidents who were in fact mentally healthy, including Vladimir Bukovsky, Natalya Gorbanevskaya, Leonid Plyushch, Mikola Plakhotnyuk, and Pyotr Grigorenko. Revaz Korinteli, a professor of the Grigol Robakidze University, says that Snezhnevsky broadened the borders of schizophrenia, and in this connection there was legal and theoretical justification for employing compulsory, involuntary treatment of dissenters in mental hospitals.

== Premises for using the diagnosis ==
According to the Global Initiative on Psychiatry chief executive Robert van Voren, the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR arose from the concept that people who opposed the Soviet regime were mentally ill (since there was no logical reason to oppose the sociopolitical system considered the best in the world). The diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia furnished a framework for explaining this behavior. This seemed to many Soviet psychiatrists a logical explanation for why someone would be willing to abandon his happiness, family, and career for a conviction so different from what most individuals seemed to believe.

== Popularity of diagnosis ==
Because of diagnoses of sluggish schizophrenia, Russia in 1974 had 5–7 cases of schizophrenia per 1,000 population, compared to 3–4 per 1,000 in the United Kingdom. In the 1980s, Russia had three times as many schizophrenic patients per capita as the US, twice as many schizophrenic patients as West Germany, Austria and Japan, and more schizophrenic patients than any Western country. The city with the highest diagnosed prevalence of schizophrenia in the world was Moscow.

Along with paranoia, sluggish schizophrenia was the diagnosis most frequently used for the psychiatric incarceration of dissenters. Darrel Regier of the National Institute of Mental Health, one of the U.S. experts who visited Soviet psychiatric hospitals in 1989, testified that a &quot;substantial number&quot; of political dissenters had been recognized as mentally sick on the basis of such symptoms as &quot;anti-Soviet thoughts&quot; or &quot;delusions of reformism&quot;.

According to Moscow psychiatrist Alexander Danilin, the nosological approach in the Moscow psychiatric school established by Andrei Snezhnevsky (whom Danilin considered a state criminal) boiled down to the ability to diagnose schizophrenia.

== Systematics by Snezhnevsky ==
The Soviet model of schizophrenia is based on the hypothesis that a fundamental characteristic (by which schizophrenia spectrum disorders are distinguished clinically) is its longitudinal course. The hypothesis implies three main types of schizophrenia:
* Continuous: unremitting, proceeding rapidly (&quot;malignant&quot;) or slowly (&quot;sluggish&quot;), with a poor prognosis
* Periodic (or recurrent): characterized by an acute attack, followed by full remission with little or no progression
* Mixed (; in German, means &quot;phase&quot; or &quot;attack&quot;): mixture of continuous and periodic types which occurs periodically and is characterized by only partial remission.

The classification of schizophrenia types attributed to Snezhnevsky is still used in Russia, and considers sluggish schizophrenia an example of the continuous type. The prevalence of Snezhnevsky&#x27;s theories has particularly led to a broadening of the boundaries of disease such that even the mildest behavioral change is interpreted as indication of mental disorder.

=== Conditions posed as symptoms ===
A carefully crafted description of sluggish schizophrenia established that psychotic symptoms were non-essential for the diagnosis, but symptoms of psychopathy, hypochondria, depersonalization or anxiety were central to it. Symptoms considered part of the &quot;negative axis&quot; included pessimism, poor social adaptation and conflict with authorities, and were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of &quot;sluggish schizophrenia with few symptoms&quot;.
According to Snezhnevsky, patients with sluggish schizophrenia could present as seemingly sane but manifest minimal (and clinically relevant) personality changes which could remain unnoticed by the untrained eye. Patients with non-psychotic mental disorders (or who were not mentally ill) could be diagnosed with sluggish schizophrenia.
Harold Merskey and Bronislava Shafran write that many conditions which would probably be diagnosed elsewhere as hypochondriacal or personality disorders, anxiety disorders or depressive disorders appear liable to come under the banner of slowly progressive schizophrenia in Snezhnevsky&#x27;s system.

The incidence of sluggish schizophrenia increased because, according to Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, patients with this diagnosis were capable of socially functioning almost normally. Their symptoms could resemble those of a neurosis or paranoia. Patients with paranoid symptoms retained insight into their condition, but overestimated their significance and had grandiose ideas of reforming society. Sluggish schizophrenia could have such symptoms as &quot;reform delusions&quot;, &quot;perseverance&quot; and &quot;struggle for the truth&quot;. As Viktor Styazhkin reported, Snezhnevsky diagnosed a reform delusion in every case where a patient &quot;develops a new principle of human knowledge, drafts an ideal of human happiness or other projects for the benefit of mankind&quot;.

During the 1960s and 1970s, theories which contained ideas about reforming society, struggling for the truth, and religious convictions were not considered delusional paranoid disorders in nearly any foreign classifications; however, Soviet psychiatry (for ideological reasons) considered critiques of the political system and proposals to reform it as delusional behavior. The diagnoses of sluggish schizophrenia and paranoid states with delusions of reform were used only in the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries.

An audience member at a lecture by Georgi Morozov on forensic psychiatry in the Serbsky Institute asked, &quot;Tell us, Georgi Vasilevich, what is actually the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia?&quot; Since the question was asked ironically Morozov replied ironically: &quot;You know, dear colleagues, this is a very peculiar disease. There are not delusional disorders, there are not hallucinations, but there is schizophrenia!&quot;

The two Soviet psychiatrists Marat Vartanyan and Andrei Mukhin in their interview to the Soviet newspaper &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; issued on 15 July 1987 explained how it was possible that a person might be mentally ill, while people surrounding him did not notice it, for example, in the case of &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot;. What was meant by saying that a person is mentally ill? Marat Vartanyan said, &quot;... When a person is obsessively occupied with something. If you discuss another subject with him, he is a normal person who is healthy, and who may be your superior in intelligence, knowledge and eloquence. But as soon as you mention his favourite subject, his pathological obsessions flare up wildly.&quot; Vartanyan confirmed that hundreds of people with this diagnosis were hospitalized in the Soviet Union. According to Mukhin, it took place because &quot;they disseminate their pathological reformist ideas among the masses.&quot; A few months later the same newspaper listed &quot;an exceptional interest in philosophical systems, religion and art&quot; among symptoms of sluggish schizophrenia from a &quot;Manual on Psychiatry&quot; of Snezhnevsky&#x27;s Moscow school.

== Recognizing method, treatment and study ==
Only specially instructed psychiatrists could recognize sluggish schizophrenia to indefinitely treat dissenters in a &quot;Special Psychiatric Hospital&quot; with heavy doses of antipsychotic medication. Convinced of the immortality of the totalitarian USSR, Soviet psychiatrists, especially in Moscow, did not hesitate to form &quot;scientific&quot; articles and defend dissertations by using the cases of dissidents. For example, Snezhnevsky diagnosed dissident Vladimir Bukovsky as schizophrenic on 5 July 1962 and on 12 November 1971 wrote to writer Viktor Nekrasov that the characteristics of Bukovsky&#x27;s mental disease were included in the dissertation by Snezhnevsky&#x27;s colleague. All the paper products were available in medical libraries. As Semyon Gluzman recollects, when he returned to Kiev in 1982 after his absence of ten years, he was amazed to see all this &quot;scientific&quot; literature in open storage at the Kiev medical library and was even more amazed to read all the &quot;ridiculous stuff&quot; hardly put into scientific psychiatric terminology. In their papers and dissertations on treatment for litigiousness and reformism, Kosachyov and other Soviet psychiatrists recommended compulsory treatment for persons with litigiousness and reformism, in the same psychiatric hospitals used for murderers:
== Western criticism ==
Westerners first became aware of sluggish schizophrenia and its political uses in the mid-1970s, as a result of the high reported incidence of schizophrenia in the Russian population. Snezhnevsky was personally attacked in the West as an example of psychiatric abuse in the USSR. He was charged with cynically developing a system of diagnosis that could be bent for political purposes. American psychiatrist Alan A. Stone stated that Western criticism of Soviet psychiatry focused on Snezhnevsky personally because he was responsible for the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia for &quot;reformism&quot; and other such symptoms.

== Recurrence in post-Soviet countries ==
In 2010, Yuri Savenko, the president of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, warned that Professor Anatoly Smulevich, author of the monographs &quot;Problema Paranoyi&quot; (&quot;The Problem of Paranoia&quot;) (1972) and &quot;Maloprogredientnaya Shizofreniya&quot; (&quot;Continuous Sluggish Schizophrenia&quot;) (1987), which had contributed to the hyperdiagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia, had again begun to play the same role. Under his influence, therapists have begun to widely use antidepressants and antipsychotics but often in inadequate cases and in inappropriate doses, without consulting psychiatrists. This situation has opened up a huge new market for pharmaceutical firms, and the flow of the mentally ill to internists.

In their joint book &quot;Sociodinamicheskaya Psikhiatriya&quot; (&quot;Sociodynamic Psychiatry&quot;), Doctor of Medical Sciences professor of psychiatry Caesar Korolenko and Doctor of Psychological Sciences Nina Dmitrieva note that Smulevich&#x27;s clinical description of sluggish schizophrenia is extremely elusive and includes almost all possible changes in mental status and conditions that occur in a person without psychopathology: euphoria, hyperactivity, unfounded optimism, irritability, explosiveness, sensitivity, inadequacy and emotional deficit, hysterical reactions with conversive and dissociative symptoms, infantilism, obsessive-phobic states and stubbornness. At present, the hyperdiagnosis of schizophrenia becomes especially negative due to a large number of schizophreniform psychoses caused by the increasing popularity of various esoteric sects. They practice meditation, sensory deprivation, special exercises with rhythmic movements which directly stimulate the deep subconscious and, by doing so, lead to the development of psychoses with mainly reversible course. Smulevich bases the diagnosis of continuous sluggish schizophrenia, in particular, on appearance and lifestyle and stresses that the forefront in the picture of negative changes is given to the contrast between retaining mental activity (and sometimes quite high capacity for work) and mannerism, unusualness of one&#x27;s appearance and entire lifestyle. In his 2014 interview, Anatoly Smulevich says, &quot;Now everything has slightly turned in a different way, sluggish schizophrenia has been transformed into schizotypal disorder, etc. I think it is not the end of his [Snezhnevsky&#x27;s] teaching, because after a while, everything will get back into a rut, but it will not be a simple repetition but will get some new direction.&quot;

In 2009, Tatyana Dmitrieva, the then director of the Serbsky Center, said to the BBC Russian Service, &quot;A diagnosis is now made only according to the international classification, so called ICD-10. In this classification, there is no sluggish schizophrenia, and therefore, even this diagnosis has not just been made for a long time.&quot; However, according to the 2012 interview by the president of the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association Semyon Gluzman to Radio Liberty, though the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia no longer exists in Ukraine, in Russia, as far as he knows, this diagnosis still exists, and was given to Mikhail Kosenko, one of the accused in the Bolotnaya Square case. The prosecution&#x27;s case for his forced hospitalization rested on confirmation of the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia that he has been treated for over the last 12 years, until 2013 when the diagnosis was changed to that of paranoid schizophrenia by the Serbsky Center experts who examined Kosenko and convinced the court to send him for compulsory treatment to a psychiatric hospital. Zurab Kekelidze (ru), who heads the Serbsky Center and is the chief psychiatrist of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation, confirmed that Kosenko was diagnosed with sluggish schizophrenia.

According to the commentary by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia on the 2007 text by Vladimir Rotstein, a doctrinist of Snezhnevsky&#x27;s school, there are sufficient patients with delusion of reformism in psychiatric inpatient facilities for involuntary treatment. In 2012, delusion of reformism was mentioned as a symptom of mental disorder in &quot;Psychiatry: National Manual&quot;. In the same year, Vladimir Pashkovsky in his paper reported that he diagnosed 4.7 percent of 300 patients with delusion of reform. As Russian sociologist Alexander Tarasov wrote, &quot;you will be treated in a hospital so that you and all your acquaintances get to learn forever that only such people as Anatoly Chubais or German Gref can be occupied with reforming in our country.&quot; According to Raimonds Krumgolds, a former member of the political party The Other Russia, he was examined because of his &quot;delusion of reformism&quot;, which gave rise to an assumption of slow progressive schizophrenia. In 2012, Tyuvina and Balabanova in their joint paper reported that they used sulpiride to treat slow progressive schizophrenia.

<text>In computing, a directory service or name service maps the names of network resources to their respective network addresses. It is a shared information infrastructure for locating, managing, administering and organizing everyday items and network resources, which can include volumes, folders, files, printers, users, groups, devices, telephone numbers and other objects. A directory service is a critical component of a network operating system. A directory server or name server is a server which provides such a service. Each resource on the network is considered an object by the directory server. Information about a particular resource is stored as a collection of attributes associated with that resource or object.

A directory service defines a namespace for the network. The namespace is used to assign a &quot;name&quot; (unique identifier) to each of the objects. Directories typically have a set of rules determining how network resources are named and identified, which usually includes a requirement that the identifiers be unique and unambiguous. When using a directory service, a user does not have to remember the physical address of a network resource; providing a name locates the resource. Some directory services include access control provisions, limiting the availability of directory information to authorized users.

== Comparison with relational databases ==
Several things distinguish a directory service from a relational database. Data can be made redundant if it aids performance (e.g. by repeating values through rows in a table instead of relating them to the contents of a different table through a key, which technique is called denormalization; another technique could be the utilization of replicas for increasing actual throughput).

Directory schemas are object classes, attributes, name bindings and knowledge (namespaces) where an object class has:
* &quot;Must&quot; - attributes that each instances must have
* &quot;May&quot; - attributes which can be defined for an instance but can be omitted, with the absence similar to NULL in a relational database

Attributes are sometimes multi-valued, allowing multiple naming attributes at one level (such as machine type and serial number concatenation, or multiple phone numbers for &quot;work phone&quot;). Attributes and object classes are usually standardized throughout the industry; for example, X.500 attributes and classes are often formally registered with the IANA for their object ID. Therefore, directory applications try to reuse standard classes and attributes to maximize the benefit of existing directory-server software.

Object instances are slotted into namespaces; each object class inherits from its parent object class (and ultimately from the root of the hierarchy), adding attributes to the must-may list. Directory services are often central to the security design of an IT system and have a correspondingly-fine granularity of access control.

== Replication and distribution ==
Replication and distribution have distinct meanings in the design and management of a directory service. Replication is used to indicate that the same directory namespace (the same objects) are copied to another directory server for redundancy and throughput reasons; the replicated namespace is governed by the same authority. Distribution is used to indicate that multiple directory servers in different namespaces are interconnected to form a distributed directory service; each namespace can be governed by a different authority.

== Implementations ==
Directory services were part of an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) initiative for common network standards and multi-vendor interoperability. During the 1980s, the ITU and ISO created the X.500 set of standards for directory services, initially to support the requirements of inter-carrier electronic messaging and network-name lookup. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is based on the X.500 directory-information services, using the TCP/IP stack and an X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP) string-encoding scheme on the Internet.

Systems developed before the X.500 include:
* &quot;Domain Name System (DNS):&quot; The first directory service on the Internet, still in use
* &quot;Hesiod:&quot; Based on DNS and used at MIT&#x27;s Project Athena
* &quot;Network Information Service (NIS):&quot; Originally Yellow Pages (YP) Sun Microsystems&#x27; implementation of a directory service for Unix network environments. It played a role similar to Hesiod.
* &quot;NetInfo:&quot; Developed by NeXT during the late 1980s for NEXTSTEP. After its acquisition by Apple, it was released as open source and was the directory service for Mac OS X before it was deprecated for the LDAP-based Open Directory. Support for NetInfo was removed with the release of 10.5 Leopard.
* &quot;Banyan VINES:&quot; First scalable directory service
* &quot;NT Domains:&quot; Developed by Microsoft to provide directory services for Windows machines before the release of the LDAP-based Active Directory in Windows 2000. Windows Vista continues to support NT Domains after relaxing its minimum authentication protocols.

=== LDAP implementations ===
LDAP/X.500-based implementations include:
* 389 Directory Server: Free Open Source server implementation by Red Hat, with commercial support by Red Hat and SUSE.
* Active Directory: Microsoft&#x27;s directory service for Windows, originating from the X.500 directory, created for use in Exchange Server, first shipped with Windows 2000 Server and supported by successive versions of Windows
* Apache Directory Server: Directory service, written in Java, supporting LDAP, Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol; LDAPv3 certified
* Apple Open Directory: Apple&#x27;s directory server for Mac OS X, available through Mac OS X Server
* eDirectory: NetIQ&#x27;s implementation of directory services supports multiple architectures, including Windows, NetWare, Linux and several flavours of Unix and is used for user administration and configuration and software management; previously known as Novell Directory Services.
* Red Hat Directory Server: Red Hat released Red Hat Directory Server, acquired from AOL&#x27;s Netscape Security Solutions unit, as a commercial product running on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as the community-supported 389 Directory Server project. Upstream open source project is called FreeIPA.
* Oracle Internet Directory: (OID) is Oracle Corporation&#x27;s directory service, compatible with LDAP version 3.
* Sun Java System Directory Server: Sun Microsystems&#x27; directory service
* OpenDS: Open-source directory service in Java, backed by Sun Microsystems
* Oracle Unified Directory: (OUD) is Oracle Corporation&#x27;s next-generation unified directory solution. It integrates storage, synchronization, and proxy functionalities.
* Windows NT Directory Services (NTDS), later renamed Active Directory, replaced the former NT Domain system.
* Critical Path Directory Server
* OpenLDAP: Derived from the original University of Michigan LDAP implementation (like Netscape, Red Hat, Fedora and Sun JSDS implementations), it supports all computer architectures (including Unix and Unix derivatives, Linux, Windows, z/OS and a number of embedded-realtime systems).
* Lotus Domino
* Nexor Directory
* OpenDJ - a Java-based LDAP server and directory client that runs in any operating environment, under license CDDL. Developed by ForgeRock, until 2016, now maintained by OpenDJ Community

Open-source tools to create directory services include OpenLDAP, the Kerberos protocol and Samba software, which can function as a Windows domain controller with Kerberos and LDAP back ends. Administration is by GOsa or Samba SWAT.

== Using name services ==

=== Unix systems ===
Name services on Unix systems are typically configured through nsswitch.conf. Information from name services can be retrieved with getent.

<text>William Drummond (13 December 15854 December 1649), called &quot;of Hawthornden&quot;, was a Scottish poet.

==Life==
Drummond was born at Hawthornden Castle, Midlothian, to John Drummond, the first laird of Hawthornden, and Susannah Fowler, sister of the poet and courtier William Fowler and daughter of Janet Fockart. Sir Robert Drummond of Carnock, one-time Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland, was his grandfather.

Drummond received his early education at the Royal High School of Edinburgh, and graduated in July 1605 as an M.A. of the recently founded University of Edinburgh. His father was a gentleman usher at the English court (as he had been at the Scottish court from 1590) and William, in a visit to London in 1606, describes the festivities in connection with the visit of King Christian IV of Denmark. Drummond spent two years at Bourges and Paris in the study of law; and, in 1609, he was again in Scotland, where, by the death of his father in the following year, he became laird of Hawthornden at the early age of 24.

The list of books he read up to this time is preserved in his own handwriting. It indicates a strong preference for imaginative literature, and shows that he was keenly interested in contemporary verse. His collection (now in the library of the University of Edinburgh) contains many first editions of the most famous productions of the age. On finding himself his own master, Drummond naturally abandoned law for the muses; &quot;for,&quot; says his biographer in 1711, &quot;the delicacy of his wit always run on the pleasantness and usefulness of history, and on the fame and softness of poetry&quot;. In 1612 began his correspondence with Sir William Alexander of Menstrie, afterwards Earl of Stirling, which ripened into a lifelong friendship after Drummond&#x27;s visit to Menstrie in 1614.

Drummond&#x27;s first publication appeared in 1613, an elegy on the death of Henry, Prince of Wales, called &quot;Teares on the Death of Meliades&quot; (&quot;Moeliades&quot;, 3rd edit. 1614). The poem shows the influence of Spenser&#x27;s and Sidney&#x27;s pastoralism. In the same year, he published an anthology of the elegies of Chapman, Wither and others, entitled &quot;Mausoleum&quot;, or &quot;The Choisest Flowres of the Epitaphs&quot;. In 1616, the year of Shakespeare&#x27;s death, appeared &quot;Poems: Amorous, Funerall, Divine, Pastorall: in Sonnets, Songs, Sextains, Madrigals&quot;, which for several centuries was thought to commemorate Drummond&#x27;s love for a fiancée who died young, a certain Cunningham of Barns, but the story is now considered unlikely, considering that Cunningham died in July 1616 and that Drummond omitted any reference to her when he compiled a list of important dates in his life many years later. 

The poems bear marks of a close study of Sidney, and of the Italian poets. He sometimes translates directly from the Italian, especially from Giambattista Marino. &quot;Forth Feasting: A Panegyricke to the King&#x27;s Most Excellent Majestie&quot; (1617), a poem written in heroic couplets of remarkable facility, celebrates James&#x27;s visit to Scotland in that year. In 1618 Drummond began a correspondence with Michael Drayton. The two poets continued to write at intervals for thirteen years, the last letter being dated in the year of Drayton&#x27;s death. The latter had almost been persuaded by his &quot;dear Drummond&quot; to print the later books of &quot;Poly-Olbion&quot; at Hart&#x27;s Edinburgh press. In the winter of 1618–1619, Drummond had included Ben Jonson in his circle of literary friends, and at Christmas 1618 was honoured with a visit of a fortnight or more from the dramatist.

The account of their conversations, long supposed to be lost, was discovered in the Advocates&#x27; Library, Edinburgh, by David Laing, and was edited for the Shakespeare Society in 1842 and printed by Gifford &amp; Cunningham. The conversations are full of literary gossip, and embody Jonson&#x27;s opinion of himself and of his host, whom he frankly told that &quot;his verses were too much of the schooles, and were not after the fancie of the time,&quot; and again that he &quot;was too good and simple, and that oft a man&#x27;s modestie made a fool of his witt&quot;. But the publication of what was obviously intended as a private journal has given Jonson an undeserved reputation for very harsh literary judgements, and has cast blame on Drummond for blackening his guest&#x27;s memory.

In 1623 appeared the poet&#x27;s fourth publication, entitled &quot;Flowers of Sion: By William Drummond of Hawthornedenne: to which is adjoyned his Cypresse Grove&quot;. From 1625 till 1630 Drummond was probably for the most part engaged in travelling on the Continent. On 29 September 1626 he received sixteen patents for diverse devices, mainly military. These included Glasses of Archimedes which could set ships afire at sea and an early form of machine gun &quot;in which a number of musket barrels are fastened together in such a manner as to allow one man to take the place of a hundred musketeers in battle. However, there is no evidence that he actually produced any of these devices. In 1627, however, he seems to have been home for a short time, as, in that year, he appears in the entirely new character of the holder of a patent for the construction of military machines, entitled &quot;Litera Magistri Gulielmi Drummond de Fabrica Machinarum Militarium, Anno 1627&quot;.

In 1630 Drummond again began to reside permanently at Hawthornden, and in 1632 he married Elizabeth Logan, by whom he had five sons and four daughters. In 1633 Charles made his coronation visit to Scotland; and Drummond&#x27;s pen was employed in writing congratulatory speeches and verses. He was involved in organising the King&#x27;s triumphal procession through Edinburgh. As Drummond preferred High Church Episcopalianism to Presbyterianism, and was an extremely loyal subject, he supported King Charles&#x27;s policy of spreading Laudianism, though he protested against some of the methods employed to enforce it. When Lord Balmerino was put on trial for the capital offence of retaining in his possession a petition regarded as a libel against the King, Drummond in an energetic &quot;Letter&quot; (1635) urged the injustice and folly of the proceedings. About this time a claim by the earl of Menteith to the earldom of Strathearn, which was based on the assertion that King Robert III, husband of Annabella Drummond, was illegitimate, roused the poet&#x27;s pride of blood and prompted him to prepare a historical defence of his house.

Partly to please his kinsman the earl of Perth, and partly to satisfy his own curiosity, the poet made researches in the genealogy of the family. This investigation was the real secret of Drummond&#x27;s interest in Scottish history; and so we find that he now began his &quot;History of Scotland during the Reigns of the Five Jameses&quot;, a work which did not appear till 1655, and is remarkable only for its good literary style. His next work was called forth by the king&#x27;s enforced submission to the opposition of his Scottish subjects. It is entitled &quot;Irene: or a Remonstrance for Concord, Amity, and Love amongst His Majesty&#x27;s Subjects&quot; (1638), and embodies Drummond&#x27;s political creed of submission to authority as the only logical refuge from democracy, which he hated. In 1639 Drummond grudgingly signed the Covenant solely for self-protection, but was uneasy under the burden, as several political squibs by him testify. In 1643 he published &quot;Σκιαμαχία: or a Defence of a Petition tendered to the Lords of the Council of Scotland by certain Noblemen and Gentlemen&quot;, a political pamphlet in support of Cavaliers in Scotland who wished to defend the king&#x27;s cause against the Rump Parliament. Its burden is an invective against the intolerance of the then dominant Presbyterian ministers.

His later works may be described briefly as royalist pamphlets, written with more or less caution, as the times required. Drummond took the part of Montrose; and a letter from the Royalist leader in 1646 acknowledged his services. He also wrote a pamphlet, &quot;A Vindication of the Hamiltons&quot;, supporting the claims of the Duke of Hamilton to lead the Scottish army which was to release Charles I. It is said that Drummond&#x27;s health received a severe shock when news was brought of the king&#x27;s execution.

He died on 4 December 1649. He was buried in a stone vault in his parish church of Lasswade. His tomb was restored in 1892 and a bronze relief was added over the entrance.
==Public memorials==

Drummond is one of the sixteen poets and writers whose heads appear on the Scott Monument on Princes Street in Edinburgh. He appears on the far right side on the north face.

==Works==
Drummond&#x27;s most important works are the &quot;Cypresse Grove&quot; and the poems. The &quot;Cypresse Grove&quot; exhibits great wealth of illustration, and an extraordinary command of musical English. It is an essay on the folly of the fear of death. &quot;This globe of the earth,&quot; says he, &quot;which seemeth huge to us, in respect of the universe, and compared with that wide pavilion of heaven; is less than little, of no sensible quantity, and but as a point.&quot; This is one of Drummond&#x27;s favourite moods; and he uses constantly in his poems such phrases as &quot;the All,&quot; &quot;this great All.&quot; Even in such of his poems as may be called more distinctively Christian, this philosophic conception is at work.

A noteworthy feature in Drummond&#x27;s poetry, as in that of his courtier contemporaries Aytoun, Lord Stirling and others, is that it manifests no characteristic Scottish element, but owes its birth and inspiration rather to the English and Italian masters. Drummond was essentially a follower of Spenser, but, amid all his sensuousness, and even in those lines most conspicuously beautiful, there is a dash of melancholy thoughtfulness. Drummond was called &quot;the Scottish Petrarch&quot;; and his sonnets, which are the expression of a genuine passion, stand far above most of the contemporary Petrarcan imitations. A remarkable burlesque poem &quot;Polemo Middinia inter Vitarvam et Nebernam&quot; (printed anonymously in 1684) has been persistently, and with good reason, ascribed to him. It is a mock-heroic tale, in macaronic Latin enriched with Scottish Gaelic expressions, of a country feud on the Fife lands of his old friends the Cunninghams.

English composer Gerald Finzi&#x27;s &quot;Three Short Elegies&quot; Op. 5 (1926) consists of musical settings for an unaccompanied chorus of three of Drummond&#x27;s poems: &quot;Life a Right Shadow Is&quot;, &quot;This World A Hunting Is&quot; and &quot;This Life, Which Seems So Fair&quot;.

==Archives==
Drummond, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh, was a prolific collector of books and manuscripts, who donated over 600 items to his former University from 1626. As well as treasures in the fields of literature, history, geography, philosophy and theology, science, medicine and law, Drummond also donated several, now &#x27;iconic&#x27;, Shakespeare quartos. These quartos included a copy of the first good quarto of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, published during Shakespeare’s lifetime, Drummond&#x27;s contemporary. Works by Jonson, Spenser, Drayton and Sir Philip Sidney were also donated.

A volume of memorials compiled by William Drummond and continued by his son (also William) is held at the University of Dundee as part of the archives of the Brechin Diocesan Library.

<doc id="334649" wikidata="Q1081181" url="?curid=334649" title="Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)">
<text>Romeo and Juliet is a 1936 American film adapted from the play by William Shakespeare, directed by George Cukor from a screenplay by Talbot Jennings. The film stars Leslie Howard as Romeo and Norma Shearer as Juliet, and the supporting cast features John Barrymore, Basil Rathbone, and Andy Devine.

Cukor&#x27;s 1936 adaptation stays largely faithful to Shakespeare&#x27;s text but makes use of the cinematic medium to enhance the drama and romance of the story. The film, set against lavish sets and costumes, was a grand production for its time and featured Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard in the titular roles.

==Plot==
In the Italian city of Verona, two noble families, the Montagues and the Capulets, are locked in a bitter feud. Despite the longstanding animosity between their families, Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet meet and fall deeply in love at a masquerade ball.

The two secretly marry with the help of Juliet&#x27;s nurse and Friar Laurence, hoping that their union might bring peace to their feuding families. However, the street brawls between the Montagues and Capulets intensify. Mercutio, Romeo&#x27;s close friend, is killed by Tybalt, Juliet&#x27;s cousin. In a fit of rage, Romeo avenges Mercutio&#x27;s death by killing Tybalt, leading to his banishment from Verona.

Juliet is devastated by both Tybalt&#x27;s death and Romeo&#x27;s banishment. Her parents, unaware of her secret marriage to Romeo, arrange for her to marry Paris. Desperate to avoid this fate and be with Romeo, Juliet takes a potion that makes her appear dead. Romeo, not knowing it is a ruse and believing Juliet to be truly dead, returns to Verona and takes poison beside her. Juliet awakens, finds Romeo dead, and kills herself.

The tragic deaths of the young lovers lead the Montagues and Capulets to reconcile, but it is a reconciliation born from great loss and sorrow.

==Production==

===Development===
Producer Irving Thalberg pushed MGM for five years to make a film of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, in spite of studio head Louis B. Mayer&#x27;s resistance. Mayer believed that the mass audience considered the Bard over their heads, and also he was concerned with the studio&#x27;s budget constraints during the early years of the Great Depression. It was only when Jack L. Warner announced his intention to film Max Reinhardt&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; at Warner Bros. that Mayer, not to be outdone, gave Thalberg the go-ahead. The success of a 1934 Broadway revival also encouraged the idea of a film version. It starred Katharine Cornell as Juliet, Basil Rathbone as Romeo, Brian Aherne as Mercutio, and Edith Evans as The Nurse. Rathbone is the only actor from the 1934 revival to appear in the film, albeit in the role of Tybalt rather than Romeo. On the stage Tybalt was played by nineteen year old Orson Welles.

Thalberg&#x27;s stated intention was &quot;to make the production what Shakespeare would have wanted had he possessed the facilities of cinema.&quot; He went to great lengths to establish authenticity and the film&#x27;s intellectual credentials: researchers were sent to Verona to take photographs for the designers; the paintings of Botticelli, Bellini, Carpaccio, and Gozzoli were studied to provide visual inspiration; and two academic advisers (John Tucker Murray of Harvard and William Strunk Jr. of Cornell) were flown to the set, with instructions to criticise the production freely.

===Production===

Thalberg had only one choice for director: George Cukor, who was known as &quot;the women&#x27;s director&quot;. Thalberg&#x27;s vision was that the performance of Norma Shearer, his wife, would dominate the picture. In addition to such noted Shakespearean actors as Howard and Barrymore, Thalberg cast many screen actors and brought in East Coast drama coaches (such as Frances Robinson Duff who coached Shearer) to teach them. In consequence, actors previously noted for naturalism were found to give more stage-like performances. The shoot extended to six months, and the budget reached $2 million, MGM&#x27;s most expensive sound film up to that time.

As in most Shakespeare-based screenplays, Cukor and his screenwriter Talbot Jennings cut much of the original play, using around 45% of it. Many of these cuts are common ones in the theatre, such as the second chorus and the comic scene of Peter with the musicians. Others are filmic: designed to replace words with action, or rearranging scenes in order to introduce groups of characters in longer narrative sequences. Jennings retained more of Shakespeare&#x27;s poetry for the young lovers than any of his big-screen successors. Several scenes are interpolated, including three sequences featuring Friar John in Mantua. In contrast, the role of Friar Laurence (an important character in the play) is much reduced. A number of scenes are expanded as opportunities for visual spectacle, including the opening brawl (set against the backdrop of a religious procession), the wedding and Juliet&#x27;s funeral. The party scene, choreographed by Agnes de Mille, includes Rosaline (an unseen character in Shakespeare&#x27;s script) who rebuffs Romeo. The role of Peter is enlarged, and played by Andy Devine as a faint-hearted bully. He speaks lines which Shakespeare gave to other Capulet servants, making him the instigator of the opening brawl. The film includes two songs drawn from other plays by Shakespeare: &quot;Come Away Death&quot; from &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and &quot;Honour, Riches, Marriage, Blessing&quot; from &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

Clusters of images are used to define the central characters: Romeo is first sighted leaning against a ruined building in an arcadian scene, complete with a pipe-playing shepherd and his dog; the livelier Juliet is associated with Capulet&#x27;s formal garden, with its decorative fish pond.

Herbert Stothart draws on Pyotr Ilyich Tschaikovsky&#x27;s Fantasy Overture “Romeo and Juliet” when creating the film&#x27;s score. Stothart also uses the stately Pavane from Peter Warlock&#x27;s Capriol suite. Neither of these sources are credited.

==Premiere==
On the night of the Los Angeles premiere of the film at the Carthay Circle Theatre, legendary MGM producer Irving Thalberg, husband of Norma Shearer, died at age 37. The stars in attendance were so grief-stricken that publicist Frank Whitbeck, standing in front of the theater, abandoned his usual policy of interviewing them for a radio broadcast as they entered and simply announced each one as he or she arrived.

==Reception==
According to MGM records, the film earned $2,075,000 worldwide but because of its high production cost lost $922,000.

Some critics liked the film, but on the whole, neither critics nor the public responded enthusiastically. Graham Greene wrote that he was &quot;less than ever convinced that there is an aesthetic justification for filming Shakespeare at all... the effect of even the best scenes is to distract.&quot; &quot;Ornate but not garish, extravagant but in perfect taste, expansive but never overwhelming, the picture reflects great credit upon its producers and upon the screen as a whole&quot;, wrote Frank Nugent in a rave review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;It is a dignified, sensitive and entirely admirable Shakespearean—not Hollywoodean—production.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the film a &quot;faithful&quot; adaptation with &quot;very beautiful&quot; costuming, but also found it &quot;not too imaginative&quot; and &quot;a long sit&quot; at over two hours. &quot;Film Daily&quot; raved that it was a &quot;superb and important achievement&quot; and &quot;one of the most important contributions to the screen since the inception of talking pictures.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;a very definite achievement&quot; but &quot;somewhat cumbersome&quot;, writing &quot;This is a good, sensible presentation of &#x27;Romeo and Juliet,&#x27; but it won&#x27;t be one you&#x27;ll hark back to when you are discussing the movies as great art, if you do ever discuss them as great art.&quot;

Many moviegoers considered the film too &quot;arty&quot;, staying away as they had from Warner&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; a year before and leading Hollywood to abandon the Bard for over a decade. The film nevertheless received four Oscar nominations and for many years was considered one of the great MGM classics. In his annual &quot;Movie and Video Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin gives both this film version and the popular 1968 Franco Zeffirelli version (with Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting) an equal rating of three-and-a-half stars.

More recently, scholar Stephen Orgel describes Cukor&#x27;s film as &quot;largely miscast ... with a preposterously mature pair of lovers in Leslie Howard and Norma Shearer, and an elderly John Barrymore as a stagey Mercutio decades out of date.&quot; Barrymore was in his fifties, and played Mercutio as a flirtatious tease. Orgel adds that Tybalt, often portrayed as a hot-headed troublemaker, is played by Basil Rathbone as stuffy and pompous.

Patricia Tatspaugh observes that subsequent film versions made use of &quot;younger, less experienced but more photogenic actors&quot; in the central roles. Cukor, interviewed in 1970, said of this film: &quot;It&#x27;s one picture that if I had to do over again, I&#x27;d know how. I&#x27;d get the garlic and the Mediterranean into it.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
In 2002, the American Film Institute nominated this film for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions.

The film is listed in the book &quot;The New York Times&#x27; Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made (&quot;1999 and 2004))&quot;.&quot;

==Legacy==
A colour roll of 16mm Kodachrome filmed by co-star Leslie Howard during the opening exterior sequence with Howard and Reginald Denny in costume as the crew set up is featured in the 2016 documentary &quot;Leslie Howard: The Man Who Gave a Damn&quot;.

<doc id="334651" wikidata="Q5236288" url="?curid=334651" title="David Laing (antiquary)">
<text>David Laing LLD (20 April 1793 – 18 October 1878) was a Scottish antiquary.

==Life==

Laing was born on 20 April 1793, the son of William Laing (1761–1831), a bookseller in Edinburgh, and his wife Helen Kirk. They lived and worked from the head of Chessels Court on the Canongate.

He was educated at Canongate Grammar School and then attended the University of Edinburgh. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed to his father. They formed W &amp; D Laing Booksellers at 49 South Bridge, living at Ramsay Lodge at 66 Lauriston in 1830. Shortly after the death of his father in 1837, Laing was elected to be Librarian of the Signet Library replacing Macvey Napier, a post he retained until his death. Apart from general bibliographical knowledge, Laing was best known as a student of the literary and artistic history of Scotland.

In 1864 he was awarded an honorary doctorate (LLD) by the University of Edinburgh.

Laing was struck with paralysis in October 1878 while in the Signet Library, and it is said that, on recovering consciousness, he looked about and asked if a proof of Wyntoun had been sent from the printers. He died a few days afterwards, aged 85, at his home, 68 Promenade in Portobello. He is buried in New Calton Burial Ground in east Edinburgh. The grave lies on the north wall near the northeast corner.

His library was sold at auction by Sotheby, Wilkinson &amp; Hodge over a period of 31 days, and realised £16,137. He bequeathed his collection of manuscripts to the University of Edinburgh.
==Works==
Laing published no original books but edited the works of others. Of these, the major ones are: William Dunbar&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; (2 vols., 1834), with a supplement added in 1865; Robert Baillie&#x27;s &quot;Letters and Journals&quot; (3 vols.; 1841–42); John Knox&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; (6 vols.; 1846–64); &quot;Poems and Fables of Robert Henryson&quot; (1865); Andrew of Wyntoun&#x27;s &quot;Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland&quot; (3 vols.; 1872–79); and &quot;Sir David Lyndsay&#x27;s Poetical Works&quot; (3 vols.; 1879).

For over 50 years, Laing was a member of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and contributed over 100 papers to its &quot;Proceedings&quot;. He was an original member of and the long-standing secretary to the Bannatyne Club, many of whose publications were edited by him.

Since 2016, her television appearances have primarily been made-for-TV movies on the Hallmark Channel.

==Early life==
Rachael Leigh Cook was born on October 4, 1979, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the daughter of Thomas Howard Cook, a social worker and former stand-up comedian, and JoAnn, a cooking instructor and weaver. She is of part English and Italian descent. Cook first appeared in a public service announcement for foster care at seven years of age and began working as a child print model at the age of 10, including nationwide advertisements for Target and appearing on the boxes of Milk-Bone dog biscuits. She attended Clara Barton Open School, Laurel Springs School, and Minneapolis South High School.

==Career==

Cook began auditioning for acting work at age 14. She made her screen debut as an actress in the 1995 film &quot;The Baby-Sitters Club&quot;. She also played a role in the adventure film &quot;Tom and Huck&quot;, released in December 1995. In 1996, her modeling agency sent her to star in a short film, &quot;26 Summer Street&quot;. In 1997, Cook appeared in a leading role in the film &quot;Country Justice&quot; as a 15-year-old rape victim who is impregnated by her rapist.

In 1999, Cook starred in her breakout role in the romantic comedy film &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot;, the most financially successful film of her career. In 2000, she starred opposite Elijah Wood in the well-received &quot;The Bumblebee Flies Anyway&quot;. She took the lead role in 2001&#x27;s &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;, which turned out to be a box office failure, although it has since become a cult classic.

In 2000, she was the cover girl for the U.S. March/April issue of &quot;FHM&quot;. She also starred in the music video for New Found Glory&#x27;s 2000 single &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;.

She had a role in the Western horror film &quot;Vampire&quot;, the English-language feature debut of Japanese director Iwai Shunji. In 2012, Cook signed on to play the female lead role in the TNT crime drama series &quot;Perception&quot; opposite Eric McCormack. She starred in the independent film &quot;Broken Kingdom&quot;, which was directed by her husband Daniel Gillies. She also appeared in a &quot;Funny or Die&quot; sketch with Chad Michael Murray.

Cook starred in the Hallmark Channel original film &quot;Summer Love&quot; in 2016. In the same year, she starred in another Hallmark film, &quot;Autumn In the Vineyard&quot;, followed by its sequel &quot;Summer in the Vineyard&quot; in 2017. 2017 also saw Cook develop, star and executive produce the Hallmark Channel film &quot;Frozen in Love&quot;, which was broadcast in January 2018 as part of the channel&#x27;s &#x27;Winterfest&#x27; season of programming.

Cook provided the voice for Chelsea Cunningham on the Kids&#x27; WB animated series &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; and in the animated film &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot;. Cook voiced Tifa Lockhart in the video games &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, &quot;Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy&quot;, as well as the film &quot;Final Fantasy VII Advent Children&quot;. In 2011, she voiced the character of Jaesa Willsaam in the MMO game, &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;. Cook&#x27;s latest voice-over role is for the video game &quot;Yakuza&quot; in which she voices the role of Reina. In 2020 Cook appeared in the fifteenth season of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; playing the role of Max in the final episodes of the series.

Cook owns her own production company, Ben&#x27;s Sister Productions (in reference to her younger brother Ben Cook). She produced and starred in the film &quot;Love, Guaranteed&quot;, which debuted on Netflix on September 3, 2020.

==Public service==
Cook first gained national attention in 1997, when she was featured in an updated &quot;This Is Your Brain on Drugs&quot; public service announcement (PSA) television advertisement, in which she proceeds to destroy a kitchen with a frying pan.

In 2011, she was selected by the Obama administration as a Champion of Change for Arts Education.

In June 2012, she began to award a small scholarship to students between ages 14 and 19. The scholarship helps pay for career classes, mentoring programs, and other school fees.

In 2017, Rachael Leigh Cook reprised her &quot;This Is Your Brain on Drugs&quot; role twenty years later for a PSA by the Drug Policy Alliance critiquing the War on Drugs and its contribution to mass incarceration, structural racism and poverty. The ad was posted to YouTube on April 20, 2017, in recognition of 4/20.

==Personal life==
Cook married New Zealand-Canadian actor Daniel Gillies on August 8, 2004, “We got engaged after dating for maybe five months and we got married a couple of months after that.” They have two children: a daughter born in September 2013 and a son born in April 2015. The couple separated in June 2019 and divorced in 2021. 

Cook is a vegetarian.

<doc id="334654" wikidata="Q734509" url="?curid=334654" title="Jayaprakash Narayan">
<text>Jayaprakash Narayan Srivastava (; 11 October 1902 – 8 October 1979), also known as JP and Lok Nayak (Hindi for &quot;People&#x27;s leader&quot;), was an Indian politician, theorist and independence activist. He is mainly remembered for leading the mid-1970s opposition against Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and calling for her overthrow in a &quot;total revolution&quot;. In 1999, Narayan was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian award, in recognition of his social service. His other awards include the Ramon Magsaysay Award for public service in 1965.

==Early life==
Jayprakash Narayan Srivastava was born on 11 October 1902 in the village of Sitabdiara, Saran district, Bengal Presidency, British India (present-day Ballia district, Uttar Pradesh, India). His house was near the banks of the flood-prone Ghaghara river; every time the river swelled, the house would be slightly damaged, eventually forcing the family to move a few kilometres away to a settlement that is now known as Jayprakash Nagar, Uttar Pradesh.

Narayan came from a Srivastava Kayastha family. He was the fourth child of Harsu Dayal and Phul Rani Devi. His father was a junior official in the canal department of the state government and often toured the region. When Narayan was nine years old, he left his village to enrol in the seventh class of the collegiate school at Patna. This was his first break from village life. Narayan stayed at Saraswati Bhawan, a student hostel in which most of the boys were older than him and included some of Bihar&#x27;s future leaders, such as its first chief minister Krishna Singh, his deputy Anugrah Narayan Sinha and several others who became politicians and academics.

In October 1918, Narayan married Braj Kishore Prasad&#x27;s elder daughter and independence activist Prabhavati Devi. After their wedding, because Narayan was working in Patna and it was difficult for his wife to stay with him, Mahatma Gandhi invited Prabhavati to become an inmate at Sabarmati Ashram (Ahmedabad). Jayaprakash, along with some friends, went to listen to Maulana Abul Kalam Azad speak about Gandhi&#x27;s non-cooperation movement against the passing of the Rowlatt Act of 1919. Azad was a brilliant orator and his call to give up English education was &quot;like leaves before a storm: Jayaprakash has swept away and momentarily lifted up to the skies. That brief experience of soaring up with the winds of a great idea left imprints on his inner being&quot;. Inspired by Azad&#x27;s words, Jayaprakash left Bihar National College with just 20 days remaining to his examinations. Jayaprakash joined the Bihar Vidyapeeth, a college founded by Rajendra Prasad, and became among the first students of Gandhian Anugraha Narayan Sinha.

== Higher education in the United States ==

After exhausting the courses at the Vidyapeeth, Narayan decided to continue his studies in the United States. At age 20, Jayaprakash sailed aboard the cargo ship &quot;Janus&quot; while Prabhavati remained at Sabarmati. Jayaprakash reached California on October 8, 1922, and was admitted to University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) in January 1923. To pay for his education, Narayan picked grapes, packed fruits at a canning factory, washed dishes, and worked as a garage mechanic and at a slaughterhouse, sold lotions and taught. These jobs gave Narayan an insight into the difficulties of the working class.

After a semester studying chemistry at UC Berkeley, his fees doubled and Narayan was forced to transfer to The University of Iowa and later to other universities. He pursued his favourite subject, sociology, and received much help from Professor Edward A. Ross.

In Wisconsin, Narayan was introduced to Karl Marx&#x27;s book &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. News of the success of the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War made Narayan conclude Marxism was the way to alleviate the suffering of the masses. He studied books by Indian intellectuals and Communist theoreticians M. N. Roy. Narayan&#x27;s paper on sociology &quot;Cultural Variation&quot; was declared the best of the year. Narayan graduated from University of Wisconsin with a MA in Sociology, and from Ohio State University with a BA in behavioural science. While in the United States, he met K. B. Menon, then teaching at Harvard, ultimately persuading him to return to India and join the independence movement there.

==Politics==
Having become a Marxist, Narayan returned from the US to India in late 1929. The same year, he joined the Indian National Congress (INC or Congress) on the invitation of Jawaharlal Nehru; Mahatma Gandhi became Narayan&#x27;s mentor in the Congress. Narayan shared a house at Kadam Kuan in Patna with his close friend and nationalist Ganga Sharan Singh (Sinha) with whom he shared a lasting friendship.

After being jailed in 1930 for civil disobedience against British rule, Narayan was imprisoned in Nasik Jail, where he met Rammanohar Lohia, Minoo Masani, Achyut Patwardhan, Asoka Mehta, Basawon Singh, Yusuf Desai, C K Narayanaswami and other national leaders. After his release, the Congress Socialist Party (CSP), a left-wing group within the Congress, was formed with Acharya Narendra Deva as president and Narayan as general secretary.

When Mahatma Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement in August 1942, Narayan, along with Yogendra Shukla, Suraj Narayan Singh, Gulab Chand Gupta, Pandit Ramnandan Mishra, Shaligram Singh and Shyam Barthwar, scaled the wall of Hazaribagh Central Jail with a goal of starting an underground movement for freedom. Many young socialist leaders like Rammanohar Lohia, Chhotubhai Puranik and Aruna Asaf Ali took part in the movement. Because Narayan was ill, Yogendra Shukla walked to Gaya with Narayan on his shoulders, a distance of about . Narayan also served as the chairman of &quot;Anugrah Smarak Nidhi&quot; (Anugrah Narayan Memorial Fund).

== After Independence ==
Between 1947 and 1953, Jayaprakash Narayan was President of All India Railwaymen&#x27;s Federation, the largest labour union in Indian Railways.

==Emergency==
In 1975, Allahabad High Court found Indira Gandhi guilty of violating electoral laws. Narayan called for Gandhi and the CMs to resign, and the military and police to disregard unconstitutional and immoral orders. He advocated a program of social transformation, which he termed &quot;Sampoorna kraanti&quot; (total revolution). Immediately afterwards, Gandhi proclaimed a national Emergency on the midnight of 25 June 1975. Desai, opposition leaders, and dissenting members of Gandhi&#x27;s own party were arrested that day.

Jayaprakash Narayan gathered a crowd of 100,000 people at Ramlila grounds and recited &quot;Rashtrakavi&quot; Ramdhari Singh &#x27;Dinkar&#x27; poem &quot;Singhasan Khaali Karo Ke Janata Aaati Hai&quot;.

Narayan was detained at Chandigarh; he asked for one month of parole to mobilise relief in flooded parts of Bihar. His health suddenly deteriorated on 24 October 1975, and he was released on 12 November the same year. At Jaslok Hospital, Bombay, Narayan was diagnosed with kidney failure; he would be on kidney dialysis for the rest of his life.

In the UK, Surur Hoda launched &quot;Free JP&quot;, a campaign for the release of Jayaprakash Narayan that was chaired by Nobel Peace Prize winner Philip Noel-Baker.

On 18 January 1977, Indira Gandhi revoked the emergency and announced elections. The Janata Party, a vehicle for the broad spectrum of the opposition to Gandhi, was formed under JP&#x27;s guidance. The Janata Party was voted into power and became the first non-Congress party to form a central government. In the 1977 Indian presidential election, Narayan was proposed as President of India by Janata Party leaders but he refused and Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, then Speaker of the Lok Sabha, became president.

==Private life==
At the age of 17, Jayaprakash was married to Prabhavati Devi, daughter of lawyer and nationalist Brij Kishore Prasad in October 1919. Prabhavati was very independent and on Gandhi&#x27;s invitation, went to stay at his ashram while Jayaprakash continued his studies. Prabhavati Devi died on 15 April 1973 after a long battle with cancer.

==Death==
In March 1979, while he was in the hospital, Narayan&#x27;s death was erroneously announced by the Indian prime minister Morarji Desai, causing a wave of national mourning, including the suspension of parliament and regular radio broadcasting, and the closure of schools and shops. When he was told about the mistake a few weeks later, Narayan smiled. Narayan died in Patna, Bihar, on 8 October 1979, three days before his 77th birthday, due to the effects of diabetes and heart disease.

<text>General Sir George Wentworth Alexander Higginson, (21 June 1826 – 1 February 1927) was a British Army officer and veteran of the Crimean War who served more than 30 years in the Grenadier Guards.

==Early life==
Higginson was born in 1826 in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England. He was the son of General George Powell Higginson, Grenadier Guards, who distinguished himself at the Battle of Corunna, and Lady Frances Elizabeth, daughter of Francis Needham, 1st Earl of Kilmorey. His paternal grandmother was the painter Martha Isaacs, wife of Alexander Higginson, of the East India Company, chief of the provincial council at Burdwan, West Bengal, and member of the Board of Trade. The Higginsons were a military family, and owned a large timber wharf on the Thames and land in Essex and at Marlow, Buckinghamshire. He spent his childhood in West London, which at that time consisted of villages and fields, and was educated at Eton College.

==Military career==
On 14 February 1845, Higginson was commissioned by purchase in the 1st Regiment of the Grenadier Guards with the regimental rank of ensign (army rank of lieutenant). He was promoted by purchase to regimental lieutenant (army rank of captain) on 12 July 1850. He was appointed as the regimental adjutant on 5 December 1851. As Adjutant of the 3rd Battalion, he served throughout the Crimean War. He participated in the battles of Alma, Balaclava and Inkerman, having his horse shot from under him at Inkerman. He was promoted to the brevet rank of major in the army on 12 December 1854. He was also present at the siege and fall of Sebastopol, following which he served as Brigade Major of his regiment, until the end of the war. He was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel in the army on 2 November 1855, and was promoted by purchase to lieutenant colonel on 10 April 1857. 
Higginson, throughout his career, travelled extensively on military affairs, to Ireland, Canada, France, Italy and Russia. He also spent time in the United States during the American Civil War, where he had family ties. He was promoted to the brevet rank of colonel on 30 September 1863, to regimental major (army rank of lieutenant colonel) on 10 July 1870 and to regimental lieutenant colonel (army rank of colonel) on 15 September 1877. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1871 Birthday Honours.

Promoted to major general on 1 October 1877, from 1879 to 1884 he was Major General commanding the Brigade of Guards and General Officer Commanding the Home District. As Commanding Officer of the Brigade of Guards, he was asked in 1882 to assist in the (now defunct) Royal Tournament. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 1 April 1883.

Higginson served as Lieutenant of the Tower of London from 1888 to 1893. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1889 Birthday Honours, promoted to general on 11 October 1890, and retired on 21 June 1893 after 38 years of service.

==Later life==
He was a personal friend of the Royal Family, and had close ties with King Edward VII. King George V and Queen Mary were regular visitors to Gyldernscroft, his home in Marlow. In 1923, aged 96, he became a godfather to George Lascelles, later 7th Earl of Harewood, the first grandson of King George V and Queen Mary, and elder son of Princess Mary and Viscount Lascelles.

On 24 June 1918, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Buckinghamshire. Higginson&#x27;s 100th birthday was celebrated with great splendour in his native Marlow. To mark that birthday, the inhabitants of Marlow organised a public collection and, with its proceeds, purchased Court Garden, Marlow and its grounds, alongside the River Thames, with the grounds becoming a public park called Higginson Park as a memorial to what they considered their town&#x27;s most famous son. Higginson himself contributed generously to the collection. At a ceremony in the town, Princess Mary, the Princess Royal, presented the deeds of the park to Higginson.

Higginson was associated for many years with the Gordon Boys&#x27; Home (now Gordon&#x27;s School) at West End near Woking, Surrey, which was founded as the national memorial to Major General Charles Gordon, who was killed at Khartoum, Sudan, in 1885.

Higginson wrote an autobiography in 1916, entitled &quot;71 Years of a Guardsman&#x27;s Life&quot;. Higginson died in February 1927, and his funeral, with full military honours, was described by observers as the grandest Marlow had seen, with hundreds lining the streets.

<text>Robert Henryson (Middle Scots: Robert Henrysoun) was a poet who flourished in Scotland in the period c. 1460–1500. Counted among the Scots &quot;makars&quot;, he lived in the royal burgh of Dunfermline and is a distinctive voice in the Northern Renaissance at a time when the culture was on a cusp between medieval and renaissance sensibilities. Little is known of his life, but evidence suggests that he was a teacher who had training in law and the humanities, that he had a connection with Dunfermline Abbey and that he may also have been associated for a period with Glasgow University. His poetry was composed in Middle Scots at a time when this was the state language. His writing consists mainly of narrative works. His surviving body of work amounts to almost 5000 lines.

==Works==

Henryson&#x27;s surviving canon consists of three long poems and around twelve miscellaneous short works in various genres. The longest poem is his &quot;Morall Fabillis,&quot; a tight, intricately structured set of thirteen fable stories in a cycle that runs just short of 3000 lines. Two other long works survive, both a little over 600 lines each. One is &quot;The Tale of Orpheus and Erudices his Quene,&quot; his dynamic and inventive version of the Orpheus story. The other is his &quot;Testament of Cresseid&quot;, a tale of moral and psychological subtlety in a tragic mode founded upon the literary conceit of &quot;completing&quot; Criseyde&#x27;s story-arc from Chaucer&#x27;s Troilus and Criseyde. Emily Wingfield has explored its significance in relation to the deployment of the Trojan Legend in political discourse between England and Scotland.

The range of Henryson&#x27;s shorter works includes &quot;Robene and Makyne,&quot; a pastourelle on a theme of love, as well as a bawdy passage of comic flyting which targets the medical practises of his day, a highly crafted and compressed poem of Marian devotion, some allegorical works, some philosophical meditations, and a prayer against the pest. As with his longer works, his outward themes often carry important subtexts. 

Constructing a sure chronology for Henryson&#x27;s writings is not possible, but his Orpheus story may have been written earlier in his career, during his time in Glasgow, since one of its principal sources was contained in the university library. Internal evidence has been used to suggest that the &quot;Morall Fabillis&quot; were composed during the 1480s.

==Biographical inferences==

There is no record of when or where Henryson was born or educated. The earliest found unconfirmed reference to him occurs on 10 September 1462, when a man of his name with license to teach is on record as having taken a post in the recently founded University of Glasgow. If this was the poet, as is usually assumed, then the citation indicates that he had completed studies in both arts and canon law.

Almost all early references to Henryson firmly associate his name with Dunfermline. He probably had some attachment to the city&#x27;s Benedictine abbey, the burial place for many of the kingdom&#x27;s monarchs and an important centre for pilgrimage close to a major ferry-crossing &quot;en route&quot; to St Andrews. Direct unconfirmed evidence for this connection occurs in 1478 when his name appears as a witness on abbey charters. If this was the poet, then it would establish that one of his functions was as notary for the abbey, an institution which possessed and managed a vast portfolio of territory across Scotland. 

The almost universal references to Henryson as schoolmaster are usually taken to mean that he taught in and had some duty to run the grammar school for Dunfermline&#x27;s abbatial burgh. A partial picture of what this meant in practice may be derived from a &quot;confirmatio&quot; of 1468 which granted provision to build a &quot;suitable&quot; house for the habitation of a &quot;priest&quot; (as master of grammar) and &quot;scholars&quot; in Dunfermline, including &quot;poor scholars being taught free of charge&quot;. 

Dunfermline, as a royal burgh with capital status, was routinely visited by the court with residences directly linked to the abbey complex. There is no record of Henryson as a court poet, but the close proximity makes acquaintance with the royal household likely. He was active during the reigns of James III and James IV, both of whom had strong interests in literature. 

According to the poet William Dunbar, Henryson died in Dunfermline. An apocryphal story by the English poet Francis Kynaston in the early 17th century refers to the flux as the cause of death, but this has not been established. The year of death also is unknown, although c.1498-9, a time of plague in the burgh, has been tentatively suggested. However, Dunbar gives the terminus ad quem in a couplet (usually considered to have been composed 1505) which simply states that Death &quot;in Dunfermelyne&quot; 

:&quot;...hes done roune&quot; (has whispered in private)
:&quot;with Maister Robert Henrysoun&quot;.
(William Dunbar, &quot;Lament for the Makaris&quot;, lines 81–2)

Almost nothing else is known of Henryson outside of his surviving writing. It is not known if he originated from Dunfermline and a suggestion that he may have been linked to the Fife branch of the Clan Henderson is not possible to verify, although his name is certainly of that ilk.

==General style==

Henryson generally wrote in a first-person voice using a familiar tone that quickly brings the reader into his confidence and gives a notable impression of authentic personality and beliefs. The writing stays rooted in daily life and continues to feel grounded even when the themes are metaphysical or elements are fantastic. His language is a supple, flowing and concise Scots that clearly shows he knew Latin, while scenes are usually given a deftly evocative Scottish setting which can only have come from close connection and observation. This detailed, intimate and realistic approach, at times, strongly suggests matters of personal experience and attitudes to actual contemporary events, yet the specifics remain elusive in ways that tantalise readers and critics. Some of this sense of intrigue may be in part accidental, but it is also heightened by his cannily controlled application of a philosophy of fiction, a frequently self-proclaimed feature of the work. 

No concrete details of his life can be directly inferred from his works, but there are some passages of self-reflection that appear to contain autobiographical implications, particularly in the opening stanzas of his &quot;Testament of Cresseid&quot;.

==Henryson&#x27;s Scots==

Henryson wrote using the Scots language of the 15th century. This was in an age when the use of vernacular languages for literature in many parts of Europe was increasingly taking the place of Latin, the long-established lingua franca across the continent.

==Legacy==
Poet Seamus Heaney adapted Henryson&#x27;s fables and they were published by Faber and Faber in 2010. The poems were made into a series of short, animated films, shortly before he died. Heaney worked with Scottish actor Billy Connolly in the production of the works, with a score composed for the project by pianist Barry Douglas. The films were broadcast on the BBC in 2014, shortly after Heaney&#x27;s death - one of the last creations of Heaney&#x27;s life. 

==Extant poems==

All known and extant writings attributed to Robert Henryson are listed here. In addition, the scholar Matthew P McDiarmid identified from an index a lost poem by Henryson which began: &quot;On fut by Forth as I couth found&quot; (not listed below).

<text>Blanche Lambert Lincoln (born Blanche Meyers Lambert; September 30, 1960) is an American politician who served as a United States Senator from Arkansas from 1999 to 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, she was first elected to the Senate in 1998; she was the first woman elected to the Senate from Arkansas since Hattie Caraway in 1932 and youngest woman ever elected to the Senate at age 38. She previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing from 1993 to 1997.

Lincoln was the first woman and the first Arkansan to serve as chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. She also served as the Chair of Rural Outreach for the Senate Democratic Caucus. In 2010, she ran for a third term, but was defeated in a landslide by Republican John Boozman, whose brother, Fay Boozman, she had defeated in 1998. She is the founder and a principal of Lincoln Policy Group, a consulting firm.

==Early life, education and private career==
A seventh-generation Arkansan, Blanche Lambert was born in Helena, Phillips County, the daughter of Martha (née Kelly) and Jordan Bennett Lambert. Her father was a rice and cotton farmer. Her older sister, Mary Lambert, is a film director. She received her early education at the local public schools in Helena, and was the student council president at Central High School from 1977 to 1978.

Lincoln attended the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, where she was a member of the Chi Omega sorority. She graduated from Randolph-Macon Woman&#x27;s College (now known as Randolph College) in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1982, earning a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in biology. She originally sought to go into nursing.

After graduating from college, Lincoln served as a staff assistant for U.S. Representative Bill Alexander, a Democrat from . She remained in Alexander&#x27;s office until 1984.

Her husband Steve Lincoln m. 1994, is a distant relative of former President Abraham Lincoln.

Lincoln is an Episcopalian.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 1992, Lincoln defeated Bill Alexander in the Democratic primary, by a margin of 60 to 40 percent. She subsequently won the general election, beating Republican Terry Hayes with 70% of the vote. Her election to the House coincided with the election of fellow Arkansan Bill Clinton as President of the United States.

She called herself a centrist Democrat and was among the minority of Democrats to support CAFTA. While in the House, she was one of only 17 Democrats to vote for the Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act of 1995 which sought to change federal employment laws. The law was vetoed by President Bill Clinton. She voted in favor restricting class action lawsuits and tightening rules on personal bankruptcy. Lincoln was also one of the few Democrats in Congress to vote in favor of Bush administration&#x27;s tax cuts and she supports the permanent elimination of the estate tax.

On April 5, 1995 she was one of only 27 Democrats in the House to vote in favor of the Contract With America Tax Relief Act, which was approved by the House. Lincoln also co-sponsored and supported legislation to amend the constitution to require a balanced-budget amendment. In 1996, she championed the Freedom to Farm Act.

She was reelected to a second term under her married name, Blanche Lincoln, and served in the House of Representatives until 1997. Lincoln chose not to run for reelection in 1996; she was pregnant at that time.

==U.S. Senate==

=== First term ===
In 1998, Lincoln returned to politics and ran for the Senate seat being vacated by incumbent Senator Dale Bumpers. She defeated her Republican opponent, Fay Boozman, a state senator and the brother of future U.S. Representative John Boozman, 55 percent to 42 percent.

Lincoln concentrated primarily on issues involving farmers and rural issues. She was one of the primary advocates of the Delta Regional Authority, which is designed to spur development in the lower Mississippi Delta region.

=== Second term ===
In 2004, Lincoln was re-elected, defeating Republican state Senator Jim Holt (R-Springdale) by 56% to 44%, even as President Bush carried the state with 54% of the vote.

In March 2007, Lincoln called for the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, claiming that the firing of eight federal prosecutors created a &quot;serious breach between the Justice Department and Congress, a breach that I&#x27;m not sure can be repaired with Mr. Gonzales at the helm.&quot; She and Senator Pryor were particularly upset that Gonzales reneged on a promise to have a replacement for Bud Cummins, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, go through a Senate confirmation. Gonzales resigned in August 2007.

In 2007, Lincoln played a key role in brokering the compromise that led to passage of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. Also known as the “farm bill,” this legislation provides resources for nutrition, conservation, rural development, and renewable energy. Lincoln led the charge against defeating an amendment to the pending Farm Bill which would have capped government Agricultural subsidy payments at $250,000 per year, per farm. According to Lincoln, it was unfair to some farmers in her state, notably cotton growers. Even though the amendment passed (56–43), Lincoln threatened a filibuster if any amendment did not get a 60-vote majority, so the amendment was withdrawn after passage.

Lincoln was in the 2007 documentary &quot;14 Women&quot;, directed by her older sister, Mary Lambert.

In September 2009, Lincoln pledged to filibuster any legislation containing a Public health insurance option, such as the Affordable Health Care for America Act (the Democratic-controlled, House of Representatives&#x27; preferred health care reform bill). This move came as a surprise to liberal Democrats, who largely interpreted the move as a betrayal of traditional Democratic values. Lincoln voted in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Senate bill that eventually became the Barack Obama administration&#x27;s health care reform law. However, she voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, a package of amendments to the Affordable Care Act—passed via reconciliation process, to circumvent united Republican attempts to block the bill&#x27;s passage—in the Senate.

Lincoln&#x27;s votes on health care appeared to be positioning her as a high-profile, &quot;conservative Democrat&quot;, to avoid being perceived as a &quot;liberal&quot; by an Arkansas voting public that had turned increasingly Republican. In 2009 she spoke out in opposition to the pro-labor union bill known as the Employee Free Choice Act; this garnering her the praise of conservative interest groups like Americans for Tax Reform, but also bitter criticisms from labor unions, who publicly threatened to discourage Arkansas&#x27; remaining Democratic-leaning voters from voting for her.

In November 2009, Lincoln voted against bringing Guantanamo Bay prisoners to the United States for trial.

On December 9, 2010, Lincoln missed, by three minutes, a critical vote to repeal Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell after a dental appointment. A supporter of the bill, Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT), told reporters: &quot;She was very frustrated and apologized to both of us.&quot; She said she would have voted for repeal had she made the vote. On December 18, she voted in favor of final passage of the bill.

=== 2010 re-election campaign ===
With the Obama administration having become hugely unpopular in her home state, Lincoln&#x27;s re-election strategy in 2010 was to depict herself to Arkansas voters as independent of the Democrats. After first narrowly surviving a primary challenge by the state&#x27;s then-Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter with an early endorsement from former President and Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton, Lincoln lost in November 2010 to Republican congressman John Boozman by a landslide, 58% to 37%.

=== Caucuses and committees ===

In 2004, Lincoln co-founded the Senate Hunger Caucus. The caucus was established to provide a bi-partisan forum for Senators and staff to discuss, advance and engage the Senate&#x27;s work on national and international hunger and food insecurity issues.

Lincoln also helped form the Moderate Dems Working Group, a coalition of moderate Senate Democrats whose stated goal is to work with Senate leadership and the administration toward finding bipartisan solutions to controversial political issues. In addition, she co-founded and currently co-chairs Third Way, a moderate think-tank whose self-described goals are &quot;an economic agenda that is focused on growth and middle class success; a culture of shared values; a national security approach that is both tough and smart; and a clean energy revolution.&quot;

Lincoln served on the Senate Finance Committee; Special Committee on Aging; Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources; Senate Social Security Task Force; Rural Health Caucus; Senate New Democrat Coalition and chair of the Rural Outreach for the Senate Democratic Caucus.

On September 9, 2009, she became Chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee. In the Committee’s 184-year history, she was the first Arkansan and the first woman to serve as Chairman.

==After Congress==
Lincoln remained in Washington after her re-election loss in November 2010, working as Special Policy Advisor at the firm of Alston &amp; Bird.

In 2011 Lincoln became chair of Small Business for Sensible Regulations, a project of the National Federation of Independent Business.

In July 2013, Lincoln founded her own political consulting firm called Lincoln Policy Group.

As of November 2020, Lincoln is an advisor of the RATE Coalition (Reforming America’s Taxes Equitably), which has lobbied for lower corporate tax rates during the Biden administration. She has since submitted many testimonies to congress for the organisation on the issue of corporate tax rates.

<text>Thomas Ruddiman (October 167419 January 1757) was a Scottish classical scholar.

==Life==
Ruddiman was born on a farm near Boyndie, three miles from Banff in Banffshire, where his father was a farmer.

He was educated locally and then studied at the University of Aberdeen. Initially from 1695, he was schoolmaster in Laurencekirk. Then in 1700, through the influence of Dr Archibald Pitcairne, he became an assistant in the Advocates&#x27; Library, Edinburgh. He founded (1715) a successful printing business, and in 1728 was appointed printer to the University of Edinburgh. He acquired the &quot;Caledonian Mercury&quot; in 1729, and in 1730 was appointed keeper of the Advocates&#x27; Library, resigning in 1752.

He is buried at Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh. The monument was erected in 1801 by his relative, Dr William Ruddiman. It stands in the north-west section of the graveyard.

==Family==

He was married to Anna Smith (1694–1769).

His nephew Walter Ruddiman (1719–1781) also from Banff, similarly established a successful business in Edinburgh as a printer and publisher.

==Works==
His main early writings were editions of Florence Wilson&#x27;s &quot;De Animi Tranquillitate Dialogus&quot; (1707), and the &quot;Cantici Solomonis Paraphrasis Poetica&quot; (1709) of Arthur Johnston (1587–1641), editor of the &quot;Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum&quot;. On the death of Dr Pitcairne he edited his friend&#x27;s Latin verses, and arranged for the sale of his valuable library to Peter the Great of Russia.

In 1714 he published &quot;Rudiments of the Latin Tongue&quot;, which was long used in Scottish schools. In 1715 he edited, with notes and annotations, the works of George Buchanan in two volumes folio. As Ruddiman was a Jacobite, Buchanan&#x27;s liberal views invited his criticism. A society of scholars was formed in Edinburgh to &quot;vindicate that incomparably learned and pious author from the calumnies of Mr Thomas Ruddiman&quot;; but Ruddiman&#x27;s remains the standard edition, though George Logan, John Love, James Man and others attacked him with vehemence.

Other works were: An edition of Gavin Douglas&#x27;s translation of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (1710), with an extensive Older Scots glossary; the editing and completion of James Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Selectus Diplomatum et Numismatum Scotiae Thesaurus&quot; (1739); Catalogue of the Advocates&#x27; Library (1733–42); and a famous edition of Livy (1751). He also helped Joseph Ames with his &quot;Typographical Antiquities&quot;.

Ruddiman was for many years the representative scholar of Scotland. Writing in 1766, Dr Johnson, after reproving James Boswell for some bad Latin, significantly adds--&quot;Ruddiman is dead.&quot; When Boswell proposed to write Ruddiman&#x27;s life, &quot;I should take pleasure in helping you to do honour to him&quot;, said Johnson.

<text>Julio Florencio Cortázar (26 August 1914 – 12 February 1984; ) was an Argentine and naturalised French novelist, short story writer, poet, essayist, and translator. Known as one of the founders of the Latin American Boom, Cortázar influenced an entire generation of Spanish-speaking readers and writers in America and Europe. 

He is considered to be one of the most innovative and original authors of his time, a master of history, poetic prose, and short stories as well as the author of many groundbreaking novels, a prolific author who inaugurated a new way of making literature in the Hispanic world by breaking classical molds. He is perhaps best known as the author of multiple narratives that attempt to defy the temporal linearity of traditional literature. 

Cortázar lived his childhood, adolescence, and incipient maturity in Argentina. In 1951, he settled in France for what would prove to be more than three decades. However, he also lived in Italy, Spain, and Switzerland.

==Early life==
Julio Cortázar was born on 26 August 1914, in Ixelles, a municipality of Brussels, Belgium. According to biographer Miguel Herráez, his parents, Julio José Cortázar and María Herminia Descotte, were Argentine citizens, and his father was attached to the Argentine diplomatic service in Belgium.

At the time of Cortázar&#x27;s birth, Belgium was occupied by the German troops of Kaiser Wilhelm II. After German troops arrived in Belgium, Cortázar and his family moved to Zürich where María Herminia&#x27;s parents, Victoria Gabel and Louis Descotte (a French national), were waiting in neutral territory. The family group spent the next two years in Switzerland, first in Zürich, then Geneva, before moving for a short period to Barcelona. The Cortázars settled outside of Buenos Aires by the end of 1919.

Cortázar&#x27;s father left when Julio was six, and the family had no further contact with him. Cortázar spent most of his childhood in Banfield, a suburb south of Buenos Aires, with his mother and younger sister. The home in Banfield, with its backyard, was a source of inspiration for some of his stories. Despite this, in a letter to Graciela M. de Solá on 4 December 1963, he described this period of his life as &quot;full of servitude, excessive touchiness, terrible and frequent sadness.&quot; He was a sickly child and spent much of his childhood in bed reading. His mother, who spoke several languages and was a great reader herself, introduced her son to the works of Jules Verne, whom Cortázar admired for the rest of his life. In the magazine &quot;Plural&quot; (issue 44, Mexico City, May 1975) he wrote: &quot;I spent my childhood in a haze full of goblins and elves, with a sense of space and time that was different from everybody else&#x27;s&quot;.

==Education and teaching career==

Cortázar obtained a qualification as an elementary school teacher at the age of 18. He would later pursue higher education in philosophy and languages at the University of Buenos Aires Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, but left for financial reasons without receiving a degree. According to biographer Montes-Bradley, Cortázar taught in at least two high schools in Buenos Aires Province, one in the city of Chivilcoy, the other in Bolivar. In 1938, using the pseudonym of Julio Denis, he self-published a volume of sonnets, &quot;Presencia.&quot; He later repudiated this work, saying in a 1977 interview for Spanish television that publishing it was his only transgression to the principle of not publishing any books until he was convinced that what was written in them was what he meant to say. 

In 1944, he became professor of French literature at the National University of Cuyo in Mendoza, but owing to political pressure from Peronists, he resigned the position in June 1946. He subsequently worked as a translator and as director of the Cámara Argentina del Libro, a trade organization. 

In 1949, he published a play, &quot;Los Reyes&quot; (&quot;The Kings&quot;), based on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. In 1980, Cortázar delivered eight lectures at the University of California, Berkeley.
==Years in France==
In 1951, Cortázar immigrated to France, where he lived and worked for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely. From 1952 onwards, he worked intermittently for UNESCO as a translator. He wrote most of his major works in Paris or in Saignon in the south of France, where he also maintained a home. In later years he became actively engaged in opposing abuses of human rights in Latin America, and was a supporter of the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua as well as Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuban revolution and Salvador Allende&#x27;s socialist government in Chile.

Cortázar had three long-term romantic relationships with women. The first was with Aurora Bernárdez, an Argentine translator, whom he married in 1953. They separated in 1968 when he became involved with the Lithuanian writer, editor, translator, and filmmaker Ugnė Karvelis, whom he never formally married, and who reportedly stimulated Cortázar&#x27;s interest in politics, although his political sensibilities had already been awakened by a visit to Cuba in 1963, the first of multiple trips that he would make to that country throughout the remainder of his life. In 1981 he married Canadian writer Carol Dunlop. After Dunlop&#x27;s death in 1982, Aurora Bernárdez accompanied Cortázar during his final illness and, in accordance with his longstanding wishes, inherited the rights to all his works.

===Death===
Cortázar died in Paris in 1984, and is interred in the cimetière du Montparnasse. The cause of his death was reported to be leukemia, though some sources state that he died from AIDS as a result of receiving a blood transfusion.
==Works==

Cortázar wrote numerous short stories, collected in such volumes as &quot;Bestiario&quot; (1951), &quot;Final del juego&quot; (1956), and &quot;Las armas secretas&quot; (1959). In 1967, English translations by Paul Blackburn of stories selected from these volumes were published by Pantheon Books as &quot;End of the Game and Other Stories&quot;; it was later re-titled &quot;Blow-up and Other Stories&quot;. Cortázar published four novels during his lifetime: &quot;Los premios&quot; (&quot;The Winners&quot;, 1960), &quot;Hopscotch&quot; (&quot;Rayuela&quot;, 1963), &quot;62: A Model Kit&quot; (&quot;62 Modelo para Armar&quot;, 1968), and &quot;Libro de Manuel&quot; (&quot;A Manual for Manuel&quot;, 1973). Except for &quot;Los premios&quot;, which was translated by Elaine Kerrigan, these novels have been translated into English by Gregory Rabassa. Two other novels, &quot;El examen&quot; and &quot;Divertimento&quot;, though written before 1960, only appeared posthumously.

The open-ended structure of &quot;Hopscotch&quot;, which invites the reader to choose between a linear and a non-linear mode of reading, has been praised by other Latin American writers, including José Lezama Lima, Giannina Braschi, Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel García Márquez, and Mario Vargas Llosa. Cortázar&#x27;s use of interior monologue and stream of consciousness owes much to James Joyce and other modernists, but his main influences were Surrealism, the French Nouveau roman and the improvisatory aesthetic of jazz. This last interest is reflected in the notable story &quot;El perseguidor&quot; (&quot;The Pursuer&quot;), which Cortázar based on the life of the bebop saxophonist Charlie Parker.

Cortázar also published poetry, drama, and various works of non-fiction. In the 1960s, working with the artist José Silva, he created two almanac-books or &quot;libros-almanaque&quot;, &quot;La vuelta al día en ochenta mundos&quot; and &quot;Último Round&quot;, which combined various texts written by Cortázar with photographs, engravings, and other illustrations, in the manner of the &quot;almanaques del mensajero&quot; that had been widely circulated in rural Argentina during his childhood. One of his last works was a collaboration with Carol Dunlop, &quot;The Autonauts of the Cosmoroute&quot;, which relates, partly in mock-heroic style, the couple&#x27;s extended expedition along the autoroute from Paris to Marseille in a Volkswagen camper nicknamed Fafner. As a translator, he completed Spanish-language renderings of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, Marguerite Yourcenar&#x27;s novel &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;Hadrien&quot;, and the complete prose works of Edgar Allan Poe.

==Influence and legacy==

Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s film &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966) was inspired by Cortázar&#x27;s story &quot;Las babas del diablo&quot;, which in turn was based on a photograph taken by Chilean photographer Sergio Larraín during a shoot outside of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Cortázar also made a cameo appearance in Antonioni’s film, playing a homeless man who has his photograph taken by David Hemmings&#x27; character. Cortázar&#x27;s story &quot;La autopista del sur&quot; (&quot;The Southern Thruway&quot;) influenced another film of the 1960s, Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Week End&quot; (1967). The filmmaker Manuel Antín has directed three films based on Cortázar stories, &quot;Cartas de mamá&quot;, &quot;Circe&quot; and &quot;Intimidad de los parques&quot;.

Chilean novelist Roberto Bolaño cited Cortázar as a key influence on his novel &quot;The Savage Detectives&quot;: &quot;To say that I&#x27;m permanently indebted to the work of Borges and Cortázar is obvious.&quot;

Puerto Rican novelist Giannina Braschi used Cortázar&#x27;s story &quot;Las babas del diablo&quot; as a springboard for the chapter called &quot;Blow-up&quot; in her bilingual novel &quot;Yo-Yo Boing!&quot; (1998), which features scenes with Cortázar&#x27;s characters La Maga and Rocamadour. Cortázar is mentioned and spoken highly of in Rabih Alameddine&#x27;s 1998 novel, &quot;&quot;.

North American novelist Deena Metzger cites Cortázar as co-author of her novel &quot;Doors: A Fiction for Jazz Horn,&quot; written twenty years after his death.

In Buenos Aires, a school, a public library, and a square in the Palermo neighbourhood carry Cortázar&#x27;s name.

<text>Morarji Ranchhodji Desai (29 February 1896 – 10 April 1995) was an Indian politician and independence activist who served as the prime minister of India between 1977 and 1979 leading the government formed by the Janata Party. During his long career in politics, he held many important posts in government such as the chief minister of Bombay State, the home minister, the finance minister, and the deputy prime minister.

Following the death of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, Desai was a strong contender for the position of Prime Minister, only to be defeated by Indira Gandhi in 1966. He was appointed as Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister in Indira Gandhi&#x27;s cabinet, until 1969. When Indian National Congress split in 1969 he became a part of the INC (O). After the controversial emergency was lifted in 1977, the political parties of the opposition fought together against the INC (I), under the umbrella of the Janata Party, and won the 1977 election. Desai was elected prime minister, and became the first non-Congress prime minister of India. Desai was the second and the last prime minister to have been born in the nineteenth century. 

On the international scene, Desai holds international fame for his peace activism and created efforts to initiate peace between India and rival Pakistan. After India&#x27;s first nuclear test in 1974, Desai helped restore friendly relations with China and Pakistan, and vowed to avoid armed conflict such as the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971. He was honoured with the highest civilian award of Pakistan, the Nishan-e-Pakistan on 19 May 1990.

He is the oldest person to hold the office of prime minister in the history of Indian politics, at the age of 81. He subsequently retired from all political posts, but continued to campaign for the Janata Party in 1980. He was conferred with India&#x27;s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna. He died at the age of 99 in 1995.

== Early life ==
===Birth===
Morarji Desai was born into a Gujarati Anavil Brahmin family. His father&#x27;s name was Ranchhodji Nagarji Desai and his mother&#x27;s name was Vajiaben Desai. He was born in Bhadeli village, Bulsar district, Bombay Presidency, British India (present-day Valsad district, Gujarat, India) on 29 February 1896, the eldest of eight children. His father was a school teacher.

===School education and early career===
Desai underwent his primary schooling in The Kundla School (now called J.V. Modi school), Savarkundla and later joined Bai Ava Bai High School, Valsad. Desai resigned as deputy collector of Godhra in May 1930 after being found guilty of going soft on Hindus during the riots of 1927–28 there.

===Freedom fighter===
Desai then joined the freedom struggle under Mahatma Gandhi and joined the civil disobedience movement against British rule in India. He spent many years in jail during the freedom struggle and owing to his sharp leadership skills and tough spirit, he became a favourite among freedom-fighters and an important leader of the Indian National Congress in the Gujarat region. When provincial elections were held in 1934 and 1937, Desai was elected and served as the Revenue Minister and Home Minister of the Bombay Presidency.

==In government==
===Chief Minister of Bombay and Partition into two state===

Before the independence of India, he became Bombay&#x27;s Home Minister and was later elected Chief Minister of Bombay state in 1952. It was a period when movements for linguistic states were on the rise, particularly in South India. Bombay was a bi-lingual state, home to Gujarati-speaking and Marathi-speaking people. Since 1956, activist organisation Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti led a movement for a Marathi-speaking state of Maharashtra. Desai was opposed to such movements, including the Mahagujarat Movement led by Indulal Yagnik demanding a new state of Gujarat. Desai proposed that the metropolitan Mumbai be made a Union territory. His logic was that a separate development region would suit the city&#x27;s cosmopolitan nature, with citizens from diverse settings across various linguistic, cultural, and religious backgrounds living there for generations. The movement led to violence across the city and state, and Desai ordered the police to open fire on the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti demonstrators who had gathered at Flora Fountain. The protesters were led by Senapati Bapat. In the carnage that followed, 105 protesters, were killed. The issue escalated and is believed to have forced the Central Government to agree to two separate states based on language. After the formation of the present State of Maharashtra, Bombay, now Mumbai became its state capital. Flora Fountain was renamed &quot;Hutatma Chowk&quot; (&quot;Martyrs&#x27; Square&quot; in English) to honour the people killed in the firing. Later Desai moved to Delhi when he was inducted as finance Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

===Nehru cabinet===
Desai was socially conservative, pro-business, and in favour of free enterprise reforms, as opposed to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s socialistic policies.

Rising in Congress leadership, as a fierce nationalist with anti-corruption leanings, Desai was at odds with Prime Minister Nehru and his allies, and with Nehru&#x27;s age and health failing, he was considered as a possible contender for the position of Prime Minister.

===Congress party leadership contest===
In 1964 after prime minister&#x27;s Nehru&#x27;s death, Desai was outflanked in the leadership contest by the Nehru&#x27;s protege, Lal Bahadur Shastri. Desai was invited but did not join the short lived Shastri cabinet.
In early 1966, the unexpected passing away of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri after only 18 months in power made Desai once again a contender for the top position. However, he was defeated by Nehru&#x27;s daughter, Indira Gandhi, in the Congress party leadership election by a big margin.

===Indira Gandhi cabinet===
Desai served as deputy prime minister and Finance Minister of India in the Indira Gandhi government until July 1969 when Prime Minister Gandhi took the finance portfolio from him but asked him to serve as the deputy prime minister. However, to save his self-respect, Desai tendered his resignation from the Gandhi cabinet. Gandhi also nationalised the fourteen largest banks in India at the same time. There was some difference of opinion between Mrs. Gandhi and Morarji Desai related to Congress candidate for Presidency in India. 

===In opposition===
When the Congress party split in 1969, Desai joined the Indian National Congress (Organisation) faction of the party, whereas Indira Gandhi formed a new faction called Indian National Congress (Requisitionists). Alternatively, the two factions of Desai and Indira were called Syndicate and Indicate respectively. The 1971 general elections to the Indian parliament were won by Indira Gandhi&#x27;s faction in a landslide. Desai, however, was elected as a member of the Lok Sabha or lower house of Parliament. Desai went on indefinite hunger strike on 12 March 1975 to support Nav Nirman movement of Gujarat.

In 1975, Indira Gandhi was convicted of electoral fraud by the Allahabad High Court, after opponents alleged she had used government civil servants and equipment during the campaign for the 1971 General Elections. During the subsequent Emergency rule in 1975–77, Desai and other opposition leaders were jailed by the Indira Gandhi government as part of a massive crackdown.

===Janata wave of 1977===
The popular anti-corruption movement led by Jayaprakash Narayan and the Janata-wave in 1977 led to the complete routing of the Congress party in Northern India, and a landslide victory for the opposition Janata alliance in the National elections held in March 1977. Desai was selected by the Janata alliance, later Janata Party as their parliamentary leader, and thus became the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India.

==Prime Minister of India (1977–1979)==



===As a Prime Minister===
In January 1977, Indira Gandhi advised the President dissolve the Lok Sabha, which he did, and Gandhi declared that elections to the body were to be held during March 1977. Opposition leaders were also released and promptly formed the Janata alliance to fight the elections. The alliance registered a landslide victory in the election. On the urging of Jayaprakash Narayan, the Janata alliance selected Desai as their parliamentary leader and thus the Prime Minister.

====Foreign policy====
Desai restored normal relations with China, for the first time since the 1962 war. He also communicated with the military ruler of Pakistan, General Zia-ul-Haq and established friendly relations. Despite his pacifist leanings, he refused to sign the non-nuclear proliferation treaty despite the threat of stopping supply of uranium for power plants by the USA Congress.

===Nuclear programme===
Domestically, Desai played a crucial role in the Indian nuclear program after it was targeted by major nuclear powers after India conducted a surprise nuclear test in 1974. Desai kept India&#x27;s nuclear reactors stating &quot;they will never be used for atomic bombs, and I will see to it if I can help it&quot;. Internationally, he reaffirmed India&#x27;s stand that it would not manufacture nuclear weapons and would refrain from conducting even peaceful nuclear explosions. In 1977, the Carter administration offered to sell heavy water and uranium to India for its nuclear reactors but required American on-site inspection of nuclear materials. Desai declined, seeing the American stance as contradictory, in light of its own nuclear arsenal.

===Decimation of R&amp;AW===
Desai had described the Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW), India&#x27;s external intelligence agency, as the praetorian guard of Indira Gandhi and had promised to stop all activities of the R&amp;AW after becoming prime minister. He closed down much of the agency, and reduced its budget and operations, such as closing its Information Division. B. Raman, the former head of the Counter-Terrorism Division of R&amp;AW and noted security analyst, revealed that in an informal discussion, Desai indiscreetly told Pakistan&#x27;s Chief Martial Law Administrator General Zia ul-Haq that his government was well aware of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear development.

===Intra-party squabbles and collapse of Janata government===
His government undid many amendments made to the constitution during emergency and made it more difficult for any future government to impose a national emergency. However, the Janata Party coalition was full of personal and policy friction and thus failed to achieve much, owing to continuous in-wrangling and much controversy. With no party in leadership of the coalition, rival groups vied to unseat Desai. Controversial trials of prominent Congress leaders, including Indira Gandhi over Emergency-era abuses worsened the fortunes of his administration.
In 1979, Raj Narain and Charan Singh pulled out of the Janata Party, forcing Desai to resign from office and retire from politics. The chief reason for the collapse was the demand by the duo and other left-leaning members, like Madhu Limaye, Krishan Kant, and George Fernandes that no member of the Janata party could simultaneously be a member of an alternative social or political organisation. This attack on &quot;dual membership&quot; was directed specifically at members of the Janata Party who had been members of the Jan Sangh, and continued to be members of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the Jan Sangh&#x27;s ideological parent.

==Retirement and death==
Desai campaigned for the Janata Party in 1980 General Election as a senior politician but did not contest the election himself. In retirement, he lived in Mumbai. When former French Prime Minister Antoine Pinay died on 13 December 1994, Desai became the world&#x27;s oldest living former head of government. He was much honoured in his last years as a freedom-fighter of his generation. On his 99th birthday, he was visited by Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, and soon after began to fall ill. He was treated in a hospital in Mumbai due to low blood pressure and a chest infection. He died on 10 April 1995, aged 99, after he underwent surgery for a blood clot in his brain.

Desai was a moralist. He was a vegetarian &quot;both by birth and by conviction.&quot;

==Social service==
Desai was a Gandhian follower, social worker, institution builder and a great reformer. He was the chancellor of Gujarat Vidyapith. Even during his term as the prime minister he used to visit and stay at Vidyapith during the month of October. He lived simply and used to write post cards himself even when he held the office of Prime Minister. Sardar Patel deputed him to conduct meetings of farmers in Kaira district which finally led to the establishment of the Amul Cooperative movement. During his rule, he withdrew intervention in Public Distribution System and rationing shops were literally lost due to cheap sugar and oil available in the market.

==Personal life==
Desai married Gujraben in 1911, at the age of 15. Gujraben lived to see her husband becoming prime minister. She died on 25 October 1981 at the age of 81. Out of his five children, only three survived infancy. Desai&#x27;s three surviving children were: his daughters Virumati, Indu and his son Kantilal.

Virumati, who was married to Ramanlal Desai, died in early 2000s. Indu, a medical student died by suicide in 1953. Kantilal Desai, who was married to Padma Kirloskar, died in 2014.

Desai has two grandsons, through his son Kantilal; Bharat Desai and Jagdeep Desai, and one granddaughter; Varsha Desai Naik. One of Desai&#x27;s great-grandsons, Madhukeshwar Desai is currently the National Vice-President of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, the youth wing of the BJP. Madhukeshwar is married to Sneha Menon, a celebrity talkshow host. Of his great-granddaughters; Kalayani is a celebrity stylist and designer. 

Desai&#x27;s eldest great-grandson, Vishaal Desai is a film director and editor known for his documentary on the renowned yoga guru B.K.S. Iyengar, titled &#x27;Yogacharya B.K.S. Iyengar: Uniting Through Yoga.&#x27; 

Desai, a teetotaler and longtime practitioner of &#x27;urine therapy&#x27;, spoke in 1978 to Dan Rather on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; about the benefits of drinking urine. He also attributed his longevity to drinking urine.

== Awards and honours ==
=== National honours ===
** Bharat Ratna (1991)

=== Foreign honours ===

&quot;Morarji&quot;, an Indian television series about the life of Desai from his days as an independence activist till his tenure as prime minister, aired on the national public broadcaster Doordarshan&#x27;s DD National channel. The Films Division of India made &quot;For Peace and Friendship&quot;, a 1978 short documentary film directed by C. Ramani about Desai&#x27;s campaign for nuclear disarmament. Govind Namdeo appeared as Desai in the 2019 conspiracy thriller film &quot;The Gandhi Murder&quot;, by Karim Traïdia and Pankaj Sehgal, which explores a British abetment in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. Avijit Dutt appears as Desai in Mission Majnu.

&quot;Pradhanmantri&quot; (), a 2013 Indian docudrama television series which aired on ABP News and covers the various policies and political tenures of Indian PMs, dedicated the thirteenth episode – &quot;Story of Morarji Desai and Janata Party&quot; – to his term as the country&#x27;s leader.

<doc id="334678" wikidata="Q4799282" url="?curid=334678" title="Arthur Johnston (poet)">
<text>Arthur Johnston (c.1579–1641) was a Scottish poet and physician. He was born in Caskieben (later renamed Keithhall) near Inverurie in Aberdeenshire. His father, Sir George Johnston, was an Aberdeenshire laird, and his mother Christian Forbes was the daughter of Lord Forbes.

Johnston is thought to have begun his university studies at one, or both, of the colleges at the University of Aberdeen, but around 1608 he went to Italy and received an M.D. at Padua in 1610. Afterwards he lived at Sedan, Principality of Sedan as professor at the Academy of Sedan, in the company of the exiled Andrew Melville, and in 1619 was in practice in Paris. He appears to have returned to Scotland about the time of James VI&#x27;s death in 1625, and to have been in Aberdeen in about 1628. He met William Laud in Edinburgh at the time of Charles I&#x27;s Scottish coronation (1633). In that year, he had published a volume entitled &quot;Cantici Salomonis paraphrasis poetica&quot;, which, dedicated to Charles I, brought him to Laud&#x27;s notice.

Johnston was encouraged by Laud in his literary efforts, possibly as a strike against George Buchanan&#x27;s reputation as a Latin poet. Johnston was appointed rector of King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen, in June 1637. Four years later he died at Oxford, on his way to London at Laud&#x27;s invitation.

Johnston left more than ten works, all in Neo-Latin. Only two of these, published in the same year, are notable: (a) his version of the Psalms (&quot;Psalmorum Davidis paraphrasis poetica et canticorum evangelicorum&quot;, Aberdeen, 1637), and (b) his anthology of contemporary Latin verse by Scottish poets (&quot;Deliciae poetarum Scotorum huius aevi illustrium&quot;, Amsterdam, 1637).

The full version of the Psalms was the result of Laud&#x27;s encouragement. It was for some time a strong rival of Buchanan&#x27;s work, though not superior to the latter. The &quot;Deliciae&quot;, in two small thick volumes of 699 and 575 pages, was a patriotic effort in imitation of the various volumes (under a similar title) which had been popular on the Continent during the second decade of the century. The volumes are dedicated by Johnston to John Scot of Scotstarvet, at whose expense the collected works were published after Johnston&#x27;s death, at Middelburg (1642). Selections from his own poems occupy pages 439-647 of the first volume, divided into three sections, Parerga, Epigrammata and Musae Aulicae.

He published a volume of epigrams at Aberdeen in 1632. In these pieces he shows himself at his best. His sacred poems, which had appeared in the &quot;Opera&quot; (1642), were reprinted by Lauder in his &quot;Poetarum Scotorum musae sacrae&quot; (1739). The earliest lives are by Lauder and Benson (in &quot;Psalmi Davidici&quot;, 1741). Ruddiman&#x27;s &quot;Vindication of Mr George Buchanan&#x27;s Paraphrase&quot; (1745) began a pamphlet controversy regarding the merits of the rival poets.

==Family==

His niece Isobel Johnston married Peter Blackburn, Bishop of Aberdeen.

<text>Eric Rücker Eddison, CB, CMG (24 November 1882 – 18 August 1945) was an English civil servant and author, writing epic fantasy novels under the name E. R. Eddison. His best-known works include &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; (1922) and the Zimiamvian Trilogy (1935–1958).

==Biography==
Born in Adel, Leeds, Eddison&#x27;s early education came from a series of private tutors, whom he shared with the young Arthur Ransome. Ransome recalls Eddison&#x27;s daring and Machiavellian methods of getting rid of unpopular teachers in his autobiography. Afterwards Eddison was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Oxford and joined the Board of Trade in 1906, retiring in 1938 to work full-time on his fiction. He was also a member of the Viking Society for Northern Research. During a distinguished career he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George in 1924 and a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1929 for public service with the Board of Trade. He and his wife, Winifred, had one child, a daughter. Their son-in-law, Kenneth Hesketh Higson, a Royal Air Force pilot, died in an air fight over Italy in the Second World War.

==Writing==

Eddison is best known for the early romance &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; (1922) and for three volumes set in the imaginary world Zimiamvia, known as the Zimiamvian Trilogy: &quot;Mistress of Mistresses&quot; (1935), &quot;A Fish Dinner in Memison&quot; (1941), and &quot;The Mezentian Gate&quot; (1958).

Eddison was an occasional member of the Inklings, an informal literary discussion group associated with the University of Oxford. His early works of high fantasy drew both praise and criticism from the Inkling J. R. R. Tolkien, who stated that he read Eddison &quot;with great enjoyment for their sheer literary merit&quot;, but &quot;disliked his characters&quot; and found his &quot;evil and indeed silly &#x27;philosophy&#x27;&quot; tending to &quot;arrogance and cruelty&quot;. He was praised, too, by C. S. Lewis, also an Inkling. When Lewis had to go into a nursing home, he asked his secretary to bring him two books: &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; and Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Later, Eddison&#x27;s early works were praised by Ursula K. Le Guin. Tolkien generally approved of Eddison&#x27;s literary style, but found the underlying philosophy unpleasant and unattractive; while Eddison in turn thought Tolkien&#x27;s views &quot;soft&quot;. Other admirers of Eddison&#x27;s work included James Stephens, who wrote the introduction to the 1922 edition; James Branch Cabell, who provided a foreword for the 1926 American edition; Robert Silverberg, who described &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; as &quot;the greatest high fantasy of them all&quot;; and Clive Barker.

Eddison&#x27;s books are written in a meticulously recreated Jacobean prose style, seeded throughout with fragments, often acknowledged but often directly copied from his favorite authors and genres: Homer and Sappho, Shakespeare and Webster, Norse sagas and French medieval lyric poems. Critic Andy Sawyer has noted that such fragments seem to arise naturally from the &quot;barbarically sophisticated&quot; worlds Eddison has created. The books exhibit a thoroughly aristocratic sensibility; heroes and villains alike maintain an Olympian indifference to convention. Fellow fantasy author Michael Moorcock wrote that Eddison&#x27;s characters, particularly his villains, are more vivid than Tolkien&#x27;s. Others have observed that while it is historically accurate to depict the great of the world trampling on the lower classes, Eddison&#x27;s characters often treat their subjects with arrogance and insolence, and this is depicted as part of their greatness. Indeed, at the end of &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot;, the heroes, finding peace dull, pray for – and get – the revival of their enemies, so that they may go and fight them again. The historian of fantasy Brian Attebery notes that &quot;Eddison&#x27;s fantasies uphold a code that is unabashedly Nietzschean; had he written after World War II, his enthusiasm for supermen and heroic conflict might perhaps have been tempered&quot;.

The Zimiamvia books were conceived not as a trilogy but as part of a larger work left incomplete at Eddison&#x27;s death. &quot;The Mezentian Gate&quot; itself is unfinished, though Eddison provided summaries of the missing chapters shortly before his death. C. S. Lewis wrote a blurb for the cover of &quot;The Mezentian Gate&quot; when it was published calling Eddison&#x27;s works &quot;first and foremost, of art.&quot;

Eddison wrote three other books: &quot;Poems, Letters, and Memories of Philip Sidney Nairn&quot; (1916), &quot;Styrbiorn the Strong&quot; (1926) and &quot;Egil&#x27;s Saga&quot; (1930). The first was his tribute to a Trinity College friend, a poet, who, according to this source, died May 18, 1914, age 30, in Malaya, where he was a colonial administrator. According to another, possibly less reliable source, he is said to have died in his youth during World War I. The other two relate to Scandinavian saga literature; the first is a historical novel which retells &quot;Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa&quot; (alluded to in &quot;Eyrbyggja Saga&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot;). The second is a direct translation from &quot;Egil&#x27;s saga&quot;, supplemented with extensive notes, some which explain Eddison&#x27;s aesthetic and philosophical outlook.

In the 1960s Eddison’s wife, Winifred, bequeathed many of his original manuscripts and notes to the Leeds Central Library.

<doc id="334684" wikidata="Q349771" url="?curid=334684" title="Andrew Melville">
<text>Andrew Melville (1 August 1545 – 1622) was a Scottish scholar, theologian, poet and religious reformer. His fame encouraged scholars from the European continent to study at Glasgow and St. Andrews.

He was born at Baldovie, on 1 August 1545, the youngest son of Richard Melville of Baldovie, and Geills, daughter of Thomas Abercrombie of Montrose. He was educated at the Grammar School, Montrose, and the University of St Andrews. He later went to France in 1564, and studied law at Poitiers. He became regent in the College of Marceon, and took part in the defence of Poitiers against the Huguenots. He then proceeded to Geneva, where he was appointed Professor of Humanity. He returned to Scotland in 1574 and was appointed Principal of the University of Glasgow in autumn of that year. He did much to establish the University on a proper footing and founded four chairs in Languages, Science and Philosophy. He was admitted as minister of Govan in conjunction 13 July 1577. Melville was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland on 24 April 1578. He opposed the Episcopal tendency in the Church, and did much to establish the Presbyterian form of government. He further did much to remodel the Scottish Universities, especially St Andrews; St Mary&#x27;s thereafter being devoted to Divinity, Melville being appointed Principal thereof in November 1580. He was again elected Moderator of the General Assembly 24 April and 27 June 1582, and 20 June 1587. In the Assembly of October 1581, he took an active part in the libel against Robert Montgomery, Bishop of Glasgow, for simoniacal practices.

Melville was appointed on a commission to wait upon James VI in 1582, with a remonstrance and petition which, notwithstanding the entreaties of his friends, he presented. On 15 February 1584 he was summoned before the Privy Council for alleged treason in a sermon preached at St Andrews the June previous, and ordered to be imprisoned at Blackness, but his friends assisted him to escape to England. On Arran&#x27;s fall he returned to Scotland and was restored by Parliament at Linlithgow in December 1585. In 1590 he became rector of the University of St Andrews, which office he held until 1597, and at the coronation of the Queen, 17 May 1590, he recited a Latin poem, the Stephaniskion. He was again appointed Moderator of the General Assembly, 7 May 1594, but on a visitation of the University by the King in June 1597, he was deprived of his rectorship. He attended the General Assembly at Dundee, March 1598, but was ordered to withdraw by the King.

In 1599 he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Theology. He caused the Synod of Fife in 1599 to censure certain propositions in the Basilikon Doron by the King. At the Assembly at Montrose in March 1600 he unsuccessfully claimed his right to sit, but was successful in that at Burntisland May 1601. He took part in that held at Aberdeen in 1605 and offered, with others, a protest to Parliament at Perth in 1606 in favour of the right of free Assembly. For this he was summoned with others to London, where he was cited before the English Privy Council for writing a bitter Latin epigram against the accessories of Anglican worship and placed under the custody of John Overal, D.D., Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, and afterwards of Bilson, Bishop of Winchester. Again brought before the Privy Council, he broke into a violent tirade against that Court and was committed to solitary confinement in the Tower. Henri de la Tour, Duke de Bouillon, having obtained his release, appointed him to the Chair of Biblical Theology in the University of Sedan, and Melville embarked for France 19 April 1611. He died unmarried after a series of illnesses at Sedan in 1622.

==Early life and early education==
He was born at Baldovie near Montrose, Angus, the youngest son of Richard Melville (brother to Melville of Dysart).

Andrew was the youngest of nine sons of Richard Melville of Baldovy, near Montrose, where he was born 1 August 1545. He is described as the ninth son, yet speaks in a letter of 1612 as having outlived his ‘fourteen brethren.’ His father lost his life in the battle of Pinkie, when Andrew was only two years old and, his mother dying soon after, he was brought up under the care of his eldest brother Richard (1522–1575), afterwards minister of Maryton, who, at a proper age, sent him to the grammar school of Montrose.

At an early age Melville began to show a taste for learning, and his brother did everything in his power to give him the best education. He learned the rudiments of Latin at the grammar school of Montrose, after leaving which he learned Greek for two years under Pierre de Marsilliers, a Frenchman whom John Erskine of Dun had persuaded to settle at Montrose; such was Melville&#x27;s proficiency that on going to the University of St Andrews he astonished the professors by using the Greek text of Aristotle, which no one else there understood. On completing his course, Melville left St Andrews with the reputation of &quot;the best poet, philosopher, and Grecian of any young master in the land.&quot;

==Travels and study in Europe==
In 1564, at nineteen years of age, he set out for France to complete his education at the University of Paris. Having graduated at St. Andrews, he repaired to France in the autumn of 1564, reaching Paris from Dieppe after a roundabout and stormy voyage. He now attained great fluency in Greek, made acquirements in oriental languages, studied mathematics and law, and came under the direct influence of Peter Ramus, whose new methods of teaching he subsequently transplanted to Scotland.

He also attended the last course of lectures delivered by Adrianus Turnebus, professor of Greek, as well as those of Petrus Ramus, whose philosophical method and plan of teaching Melville later introduced into the universities of Scotland. It was also in Paris where Melville studied Hebrew under Jean Mercier, one of the leading hebraists of that time. From Paris he went to Poitiers (1566) to study civil law, and though only twenty-one was apparently at once made a regent in the college of St Marceon. After three years, however, political troubles compelled him to leave France, and he went to Geneva, where he was welcomed by Theodore Beza, at whose instigation he was appointed to the chair of humanity in the academy of Geneva.

In addition to teaching, Melville continued to study Oriental literature, and in particular acquired from Cornelius Bertram, one of his brother professors, a knowledge of Syriac. At Geneva as early as 1572 he met Joseph Scaliger and Francis Hottoman, who in 1572, after the massacre on St. Bartholomew&#x27;s day, took up their abode in that city. While he lived at Geneva the massacre of St Bartholomew in 1572 drove immense numbers of Protestant refugees to that city, including several of the most distinguished French men of letters of the time. Among these were several men learned in civil law, and political science, and associating with them increased Melville&#x27;s knowledge and enlarged his ideas of civil and ecclesiastical liberty.

In 1574 Melville returned to Scotland, and almost immediately received the appointment of Principal of the University of Glasgow, and began its renewal. Besides his duties in the university, he officiated as minister of the church of Govan, in the vicinity.

Melville set himself to establish a good educational system. He enlarged the curriculum, and established chairs in languages, science, philosophy and divinity, which were confirmed by charter in 1577. His fame spread, and students flocked from all parts of Scotland and beyond. He assisted in the reconstruction of the University of Aberdeen in 1575, and to do for St Andrews what he had done for Glasgow, he was appointed Principal of St Mary&#x27;s College, St Andrews, in 1580. His duties there comprised the teaching of theology, Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac and Rabbinical languages.

As a member of the General Assembly, he took a prominent part in all the measures of that body against episcopacy; and as he was unflinching in his opposition to that form of church government, he received the name of Episcopomastix, or The Scourge of Bishops. A remarkable instance of his intrepidity occurred at an interview, which took place in October 1577, between him and the Regent Morton, when the latter, irritated at the proceedings of the Assembly, exclaimed, &quot;There will never be quietness in this country till half a dozen of you be hanged or banished!&quot; &quot;Hark! Sir&quot;, said Melville, &quot;threaten your courtiers after that manner! It is the same to me whether I rot in the air, or in the ground. The earth is the Lord&#x27;s. &quot;Patria est ubicunque est bene&quot;. I have been ready to give up my life where it would not have been half so well wared, at the pleasure of my God. I have lived out of your country ten years, as well as in it. Let God be glorified, it will not be in your power to hang or exile his truth.&quot; This bold language Morton did not venture to resent.

Melville created a fashion for the study of Greek literature. The reforms, however, which his new modes of teaching involved, and even some of his new doctrines, such as the non-infallibility of Aristotle, brought him into conflict with other teachers in the university.

==Moderator of the Church&#x27;s General Assembly==


Melville was moderator of the General Assembly which met at Edinburgh 24 April 1578, in which the second Book of Discipline was approved of. The attention of the Assembly was about this time directed to the reformation and improvement of the universities, and Melville was, in December 1580, removed from Glasgow, and installed principal of St. Mary&#x27;s college, St. Andrews. Here, besides giving lectures in divinity, he taught the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and Rabbinical languages, and his prelections were attended, not only by young students in unusual numbers, but also by some of the masters of the other colleges.

He was moderator of the Assembly which met at St. Andrews on 24 April 1582, and also of an extraordinary meeting of the Assembly, convened at Edinburgh on 27 June thereafter, in consequence of the arbitrary measures of the court, in relation particularly to the case of Robert Montgomery, the excommunicated Archbishop of Glasgow. He opened the proceedings with a sermon, in which he boldly inveighed against the absolute authority claimed by the government in ecclesiastical matters. A spirited remonstrance being agreed to by the Assembly, Melville and others were appointed to present it to the king, then with the court at Perth. When the remonstrance was read before his majesty in council, the king&#x27;s unworthy favourite, the earl of Arran, menacingly exclaimed, &quot;Who dare subscribe these treasonable articles?&quot; &quot;We dare&quot;, said the undaunted Melville, and taking a pen, immediately signed his name. His example was followed by the other commissioners, and so much were Lennox and Arran over-awed by their intrepidity, that they dismissed them peaceably.

For about three years Melville had preached, assisted by his nephew, in the parish church of St. Andrews. In February 1584 he was cited before the privy council, to answer a charge of treason, founded on some seditious expressions, which it was alleged he had made use of in a sermon on the 4th chapter of Daniel, on the occasion of a fast kept during the preceding month; particularly that he had compared the king&#x27;s mother to Nebuchadnezzar, who was banished from the kingdom, and would be restored again. At his appearance, he denied using these words, entered into a full defence of those he had actually used, and presented a protest and declinature, claiming to be tried by the ecclesiastical court. When brought before the king and council, he boldly told them that they had exceeded their jurisdiction in judging of the doctrine, or calling to account any of the ambassadors or messengers of a king and council greater than they, and far above them. Then loosing a little Hebrew bible from his belt, and throwing it on the table before them, he said, &quot;That you may see your weakness, oversight, and rashness, in taking upon you that which neither you ought nor can do, there are my instructions and warrant. Let me see which of you can judge of them or control me therein, that I have passed by my injunctions.&quot; Arran, finding the book in Hebrew, put it into the king&#x27;s hands, saying, &quot; Sir, he scorns your majesty and council.&quot; &quot;No, my lord&quot;, replied Melville, &quot; I scorn not, but with all earnestness, zeal, and gravity, I stand for the cause of Jesus Christ and his church.&quot; Not being able to prove the charge against him, and unwilling to let him go, the council declared him guilty of declining their jurisdiction, and of behaving irreverently before them, and sentenced him to be imprisoned in the castle of Edinburgh, and to be further punished in his person and goods at the pleasure of the king. Before, however, being charged to enter himself in ward, his place of confinement was ordered to be changed to Blackness Castle, which was kept by a dependant of Arran. While at dinner the king&#x27;s macer was admitted and gave him the charge to enter within 24 hours: but he avoided being sent there by secretly withdrawing from Edinburgh. After staying some time at Berwick, he proceeded to London, and in the ensuing July visited the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, at both of which he was received in a manner becoming his learning and reputation.

==From England to St Andrews==

He returned to Scotland in November 1585 after an absence of twenty months, and in March 1586 resumed his lectures in St Andrews, where he continued for twenty years; he became rector of the University in 1590.

On the disgrace of the earl of Arran, Melville returned to Scotland with the banished lords, in November 1585. Having assisted in re-organising the college of Glasgow, he resumed, in the following March, his duties at St. Andrews. The synod of Fife, which met in April, proceeded to excommunicate Patrick Adamson, Archbishop of St. Andrews, for his attempts to overturn the presbyterian form of government in the church; and, in return, that prelate issued a sentence of excommunication against Melville, and his nephew, James Melville, with others of their brethren. In consequence of this difference with the archbishop, Melville received a written mandate from the king to confine his residence to the north of the Tay, and he was not restored to his office in the university till the following August. Some time after, when Adamson had been deprived of his archbishopric, and was reduced to great poverty, finding himself deserted by the king, he addressed a letter to his former antagonist, Melville, expressing regret for his past conduct, and soliciting his assistance. Melville hastened to visit him, and not only procured contributions for his relief among his friends, but continued for several months to support him from his own resources.

In June 1587, Melville was again elected moderator of the Assembly, and nominated one of the commissioners for attending to the proceedings in parliament. He was present at the coronation of the queen, 17 May 1590, and recited a Latin poem composed for the occasion, which was immediately published at the desire of the king. In the same year he was elected rector of the university of St. Andrews, an office which, for a series of years, he continued to hold by re-election. In May 1594 he was again elected moderator of the Assembly. Shortly after, he appeared on behalf of the church before the lords of the articles, and urged the forfeiture of the popish lords, and along with his nephew and two other ministers, he accompanied the king, at his express request, on his expedition against them. In October 1594 he was with the king at Huntly Castle and argued for its demolition.

In the following year, when it was proposed to recall the popish nobles from exile, he went with some other ministers to the convention of estates at St. Andrews, to remonstrate against the design, but was ordered by the king to withdraw, which he did, after a most resolute reply. The commission of the Assembly having met at Cupar in Fife, they sent Melville and some other members to expostulate with the king. Being admitted to a private audience, James Melville began to address his majesty with great mildness and respect; but the king becoming impatient, charged them with sedition, on which Andrew took him by the sleeve, and calling him &quot;God&#x27;s silly vassal&quot;, said, This is not a time to flatter, but to speak plainly, for our commission is from the living God, to whom the king is subject. We will always humbly reverence your majesty in public, but having opportunity of being with your majesty in private, we must discharge our duty, or else be enemies to Christ: And now, Sire, I must tell you that there are two kingdoms—the kingdom of Christ, which is the church, whose subject King James VI. is, and of whose kingdom he is not a head, nor a lord, but a member; and they whom Christ hath called, and commanded to watch over his church, and govern his spiritual kingdom, have sufficient power and authority from him so to do, which no Christian king nor prince should control or discharge, but assist and support, otherwise they are not faithful subjects to Christ. The king listened patiently to this bold admonition, and dismissed them with many fair promises which he never intended to fulfil. For several years following King James made repeated attempts to control the church, according to his own arbitrary notions, but he invariably encountered a strenuous opponent in Andrew Melville; and he had recourse at last to one of those stratagems which he thought the very essence of &quot;king-craft&quot;, to secure the removal of this champion of presbyterianism from Scotland altogether.

During the whole time he protected the liberties of the Scottish Church against all encroachments of the government. That in the main he was fighting for the constitutionally guaranteed rights of the Church is generally accepted. The chief charge against Melville is that his fervour often led him to forget the reverence due to an &quot;anointed monarch&quot;. When the king acted in an arbitrary and illegal manner he needed the reminder that though he was king over men he was only &quot;God&#x27;s silly vassal.&quot; Melville&#x27;s rudeness (if it is to be called so) was the outburst of just indignation from a man zealous for the purity of religion and regardless of consequences to himself.

His nephew James Melville, who was present, records the famous statement he made in Falkland in private to King James VI of Scotland, later to become King James I of England. Calling him &quot;God&#x27;s sillie vassal&quot; and taking him by the sleeve, he said,Sir, we will humblie reverence your Majestie always, namlie in public, but sen we have this occasioun to be with your Majestie in privat, and the treuthe is, yie ar brought in extream danger bathe of your lyff and croun, and with yow, the country and Kirk of Christ is lyk to wrak, for nocht telling yow the treuthe, and giffen of yow fathfull counsall, we mon [must] discharge our dewtie thairin, or els be trators bathe to Christ and yow! And thairfor Sir, as divers tymes befor, sa now again, I mon tell yow, thair is twa Kings and twa Kingdomes in Scotland. Thair is Chryst Jesus the King, and his Kingdome the Kirk, whase subject King James the Saxt is, and of whose kingdome nocht a king, nor a lord, nor a heid, bot a member! And they whome Chryst hes callit and commandit to watch over his Kirk, and govern his spirituall kingdome, hes sufficient powar of him, and authoritie sa to do, bathe togidder and severalie; the quhilk na Christian King or Prince sould control and discharge, but fortifie and assist, utherwayes nocht fathfull subjects nor members of Chryst.

==King James and imprisonment==
In 1599 he was deprived of the rectorship, but was made dean of the faculty of theology. The close of Melville&#x27;s career in Scotland was at length brought about by James in characteristic fashion. In May 1606, Melville, with his nephew, and six of their brethren, were called to London by a letter from the king, on the specious pretext that his majesty wished to consult them as to the affairs of the church. Soon after their arrival they attended the famous conference held on 23 September, in presence of the king at Hampton Court, at which Melville spoke at great length, and with a boldness which astonished the English nobility and clergy. On St. Michael&#x27;s day, Melville and his brethren were commanded to attend the royal chapel, when, scandalized at the popish character of the service, on his return to his lodging he vented his indignation in a Latin epigram, for which, a copy having been conveyed to the king, he was brought before the council at Whitehall. Being by them found guilty of &quot;scandalum magnatum,&quot; he was committed first to the custody of the dean of St. Paul&#x27;s, and afterwards to the charge of the bishop of Winchester; but was ultimately sent to the Tower, where he remained a prisoner for four years.

* The following is the epigram: 
Cur stant clausi Anglis libri duo regia in ara,&lt;br&gt;
Lumina casca duo, pollubra sicca duo?&lt;br&gt;
Num sensum cultumque Dei tenet Anglia clausum,&lt;br&gt;
Lumine exca suo, sorde sepulta sua?&lt;br&gt;
Romano an ritu, dum regalem instruit aram,&lt;br&gt;
Purpuream pingit religiosa lupam ?&lt;br&gt;

*Thus rendered in an old translation: 
&lt;br&gt;
Why stand there on the altar high&lt;br&gt;
Two closed books, blind lights, two basins dry?&lt;br&gt;
Doth England hold God&#x27;s mind and worship close.&lt;br&gt;
Blind of her sight, and buried in her dross?&lt;br&gt;
Doth she, with chapel put in Romish dress,&lt;br&gt;
The purple whore religiously express?&lt;br&gt;

*And for this Melville was sent to the tower.

At first he was treated with the utmost rigour, and denied even the use of pen, ink, and paper; but his spirit remained unsubdued, and he beguiled his solitary hours by composing Latin verses, which, with the tongue of his shoe buckle, he engraved on his prison walls. By the interference of some friends at court, his confinement was, after the lapse of nearly ten months, rendered less 
severe. About the end of 1607 the Protestants of Rochelle endeavoured to obtain his services as professor of divinity in their college, but the king would not consent to his liberation. 

==Freed to France==
At length, in February 1611, at the intercession of the duke of Bouillon, he was released from confinement, on condition of his becoming professor of theology in the Protestant university of Sedan, in France, where he spent the remainder of his life, and died there in 1622, at the advanced age of 77. 
On being freed, but refused permission to return to his own country, he was invited to fill a professor&#x27;s chair in the Academy of Sedan, and there he spent the last eleven years of his life.

==Personal life==

His biographer, Dr. M&#x27;Crie, says that Andrew Melville &quot;was the first Scotsman who added a taste for elegant literature to an extensive acquaintance with theology.&quot; Although he sustained a conspicuous part in all the important public transactions of his time, he neither was nor affected to be the leader of a party. In private he was an agreeable companion, remarkable for his cheerfulness and kindliness of disposition. He was never married. Beyond the statement that he was of low stature there is no description of his personal appearance extant, nor is there any known portrait of him.

The greater part of his writings consists of Latin poems. Dr. M&#x27;Crie, whose Life of Andrew Melville was published in 1824, in 2 volumes, has given the names of all his works, printed and left in manuscript, and there is none of any great extent among them.

<text>Greek National Road 8a (, abbreviated as EO8a) was a toll road in the Attica, Peloponnese and West Greece regions. It connected Athens with the cities of Corinth and Patras. It was built in the 1960s as a replacement for the old National Road 8 as the major route to the Peloponnese, and bypasses most towns. The National Road 8a has gradually been upgraded to a motorway, the A8. Since April 2017, the complete length of the A8 motorway has been operational.

The EO8a started east of Eleusis, where it branched off the old EO8 as a limited-access dual carriageway. Between Megara and Kineta the motorway passed through several tunnels. Its western end was the interchange with the A5 Ionia Odos, near Rio, northeast of Patras.

The total length of the route was 215 km. The eastern section, between Eleusis and Corinth, was part of European route E94. The western section, between Corinth and Rio, was part of European route E65.

==Construction==
The total length of the EO8a was delivered gradually between 1962 and 1973, replacing the older EO8. The section which first opened in November 1962, was the Athens–Corinth route, forming part of European route E94 (although the section Megara–Kineta (Kakia Skala pass) opened in late 1964, with motorway characteristics). The section Corinth–Patras was the next to follow in 1969, as a 14m width undivided road (except for the Aigio bypass, which opened in 1973 also with motorway characteristics).

Throughout the 1990s, the E94 part of the route was upgraded to motorway standards; while between 1999 and 2006, further upgrades took place at the Kakia Skala pass, converting a rather narrow and hazardous section of motorway into a state-of-the-art modern motorway, with 3 lanes per direction and a network of five tunnels and several bridges. Between 1997 and 2015, the expanded section ended near Corinth, from which it continued as a limited-access single carriageway. In 2015 the upgraded section ended near Zevgolateio and in 2016 it ended at Kiato. The remainder, between Kiato and Rio, was opened in April 2017, and the EO8a has ceased to exist.

<doc id="334687" wikidata="Q7094680" url="?curid=334687" title="Ontario Health Insurance Plan">
<text>The Ontario Health Insurance Plan (French: &quot;Assurance-Santé de l&#x27;Ontario&quot;), commonly known by the acronym OHIP (pronounced ), is the government-run health insurance plan for the Canadian province of Ontario. OHIP is funded by a payroll deduction tax by residents who are gainfully employed, by businesses in the province of Ontario, and by transfer payments from the Government of Canada.

== Covered services==

Every Ontario resident with his or her primary and permanent home in Ontario is entitled to access emergency and preventive care under OHIP free of charge. Ontario residents may go to a participating doctor—essentially every doctor practising in the province—any time they wish (subject to the consent of the doctor) and the services are billed through OHIP to the government. 

In 2018, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan announced a new program designed to assist individuals struggling with food addiction. 

=== Prescription drug ===
OHIP does not generally cover prescription drugs outside of hospitals or dental care. However, 
* the Ontario Drug Benefit program pays for prescription drugs for seniors covered by OHIP. 
* the Trillium Drug Program covers households with high prescription drug costs. 
*as of 1 January 2018, prescription drugs for those under 25 years of age are covered by OHIP through OHIP+.

As of 1 April 2019, the Ontario government will no longer offer free prescriptions to children and young adults with private coverage.

=== Physiotherapy ===
OHIP coverage for physiotherapy was restricted to those 65 years of age and over, those 19 years of age and under, residents of long-term care homes (regardless of age), individuals who had been hospitalized (regardless of age) and individuals on the Ontario Disability Support Program, Family Benefits and Ontario Works (regardless of age).

=== Optometry (eye-health services) ===
OHIP covers the cost of one major eye exam (for vision and general eye health) every 12 months, plus any minor assessments you need, but only if you are 19 years and younger, or 65 years and older. If you are 20 to 64 years old, and you have a specific medical condition affecting your eyes that requires regular monitoring, OHIP will cover a major eye exam for you once every 12 months and any follow-up appointments related to the condition. 

=== Dental care for low-income seniors ===
It provides free, routine dental services for low-income seniors who are 65 years of age or older, with the income requirements of an annual net income of $22,200 or less for a single senior, or a combined annual net income of $37,100 or less for a couple (for year 2022). 

=== OHIP Out of Country Travel Insurance ===
OHIP will only cover a very limited amount of the costs if you receive emergency health services while you’re travelling outside Canada, including the following OOC emergency services: doctor services (e.g. medical assessments, emergency surgery), emergency outpatient services (e.g. MRIs, CT scans), emergency inpatient services (e.g. hospital stays, nursing services). 

==Funding==
While Ontario receives transfer payments from the Government of Canada to partially fund health care, OHIP is also supported by general provincial tax revenues and premiums (taxes) paid by employers and individuals. Employers are charged a payroll health care tax (with an exemption for small businesses), and residents of the province pay a health premium (introduced in 2004) as part of their income taxes. Similarly, Ontario publicly funds hospitals.

The Ontario Health Premium (OHP) is a component of Ontario&#x27;s Personal Income Tax system. The OHP is based on taxable income for a taxation year. As of May 2010, an Ontario resident with taxable income (i.e., income after subtracting allowable deductions) of $21,000 pays $60 per year. With a taxable income of $22,000, the premium doubles to $120. With a taxable income of $23,000, the premium is $180. With a taxable income of $24,000, the premium is $240. The premium increases at a decreasing rate thereafter for taxable incomes up to $200,600 at which point the maximum premium of $900 is reached.

==Delisted care==
Until 2004, OHIP also paid for an eye examination every two years and limited chiropractic and physical therapy/physiotherapy services. The May 2004 budget, however, announced that most eye exams and all chiropractic and physical therapy would be &quot;delisted&quot; (removed) from coverage, by the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty. Physiotherapy ended up never being delisted from OHIP. Instead, effective April 1, 2005, OHIP coverage for physiotherapy was restricted to those 65 years of age and over, those 19 years of age and under, residents of long-term care homes (regardless of age), individuals who had been hospitalized (regardless of age) and individuals on the Ontario Disability Support Program, Family Benefits and Ontario Works (regardless of age). OHIP covers up to 50 visits per year post-hospitalization and up to 100 visits per year for residents of long-term care homes. The McGuinty government at the time promised to expand OHIP coverage for residents of long-term care homes and for residents of rural and remote areas. The provision continues to be made for free coverage to minors. Annual eye examinations are free for children (19 or younger), seniors (65 or older), adults ages 20–64 with certain ocular health conditions (including glaucoma, cataracts, and diabetes), as well as those receiving ODSP or Ontario Works (every two years).

==Eligibility==
In order to be eligible for coverage under OHIP, a person must normally be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident or a holder of a work permit as set out in Ontario&#x27;s Health Insurance Act, must have a permanent and principal home in Ontario, and must be physically present in Ontario 153 days in any 12-month period. Canadian citizens or permanent residents returning to Canada from another country are not normally covered by OHIP until they have been resident in Ontario for three months. In 2009, applicants for permanent residence from within Canada were added to the plan, following the &quot;Approval In Principle&quot; (AIP) stage of the process. Applicants from outside Canada continue to be ineligible for OHIP until they have completed the landing process and have actually become permanent residents, when the usual three-month waiting period begins. It is recommended to obtain private health insurance to cover the waiting period. For Canadian citizens or permanent residents moving to Ontario from another province, the province of the previous residency continues to cover them during the three-month waiting period.

==Waiting period==
*Transfer from another province, territory, or country: the waiting period used to be three months, but as of March 19, 2020, that has been temporarily removed because of the COVID pandemic.
*Military spouses: immediate regardless of origin.
*Applicants for permanent residence from inside Canada: obtaining of permanent residence 
*Applicants for permanent residence from outside Canada: obtaining of permanent residence (15–24 months as of April 2014)

==Precursors==
Ontario&#x27;s first government-run health plan, known as OMSIP (Ontario Medical Services Insurance Plan), was established and enacted on 1 July 1966. On 1 October 1969, it was replaced by OHSIP, the Ontario Health Services Insurance Plan, as a provincially-run and federally-assisted plan under the federal Medical Care Insurance Act for the establishment of a national medical plan. In 1972, its name was shortened to simply OHIP.

<text>Garnet Hercules Mackley (9 December 1883 – 24 April 1986) was a New Zealand businessman, railways manager and politician.

==Career==
Mackley was born in Port Chalmers. He became general manager of New Zealand Railways in 1933. During his tenure, Mackley worked hard to improve the standard and range of services provided by the railways. He won approval for the construction of an inspection car known as the &quot;Red Terror&quot; in which he travelled the entire system inspecting stations and meeting staff. The car&#x27;s success encouraged him to order the construction of railcars that were to serve the railways for many years, specifically the Midland, Wairarapa, Standard, and Vulcan classes.

He also wanted to improve the comfort of passengers and initiated a local building programme which provided the basis of passenger carriage stock for many years.

In the 1938 New Year Honours, Mackley was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. In 1940 he retired, and was made managing director of the Whakatane Paper Mills.

== Member of Parliament ==


Mackley then entered politics, becoming a Member of Parliament for the New Zealand National Party. He was elected as the MP for Masterton (1943–1946) and then for Wairarapa (1946–1949), after which he retired.

In 1950 he was appointed to the Legislative Council by National, as a member of the so-called suicide squad charged with voting for the abolition of the Council (or Upper House).

<text>John Erskine of Dun (1509–1591) was a Scottish religious reformer.

==Biography==
The son of Sir John Erskine, Laird of Dun, he was educated at King&#x27;s College, University of Aberdeen. At the age of twenty-one Erskine was the cause – probably by accident – of a priest&#x27;s death, and was forced to go abroad, where he came under the influence of the new learning. It was through him that Greek was first taught in Scotland by Pierre de Marsilliers, whom he brought to live at Montrose. This was a factor in the progress of the Reformation. Erskine was also drawn towards the new faith, being a close friend of George Wishart, the reformer, from whose fate he was saved by his wealth and influence, and of John Knox, who advised him to discountenance the mass openly.

Erskine was a supporter of Mary of Guise during the war of the Rough Wooing and she wrote to him in March 1548 to thank him for his support of Mary, Queen of Scots, and recommended him to Henri II of France. Erskine built a fort to defend the harbour of Montrose, and defeated an English landing force. In August 1549, Erskine objected to the appointment of Captain Beauchastell and a French garrison to the fort at Montrose. Guise wrote that he was still technically in command, and that, &quot;Otherwise it is not best that such thing should be done, considering we have written so much good of your part to the king, and that now any thing should be shown of you in the contrary&quot;.

In the stormy controversies of the time of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her son, James VI, Erskine was a conspicuous figure and a moderating influence. He was able to soothe the queen when her feelings had been outraged by Knox&#x27;s denunciations – being a man &quot;most gentill of nature&quot; – and frequently acted as mediator both between the Roman Catholic and reforming parties, and among the reformers themselves. In 1560 he was appointed – though a layman – superintendent of the reformed church of Scotland for Angus and Mearns, and in 1572 he gave his assent to the modified episcopacy proposed by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton at the Leith convention.

Following his ordination to the ministry in 1561, because he was held in such high esteem by the leaders of the church that he was elected moderator of the general assembly several times (first in 1564), and he was amongst those who in 1588 drew up the &quot;Second Book of Discipline&quot;. From 1579 he was a member of the king&#x27;s council. Erskine owed his peculiar influence among the Scottish reformers to his personality; Queen Mary described him as &quot;a mild and sweet-natured man, with true honesty and uprightness&quot;.

Erskine married Agnes Ogilvy, daughter of Katherine Campbell (d. 1578) and James Ogilvy, Master of Ogilvy.

== Witch hunt in 1568 ==
John Erskine of Dun obtained a commission to hold a judiciary court in April 1568 to hold trials for nearly 40 people in Angus and the Mearns suspected of &quot;crimes of sorcery and witchcraft&quot;.

<text>Victor Frederick Snyder (born September 27, 1947) is an American physician, lawyer, and politician who was the U.S. representative for from 1997 to 2011. He is a member of the Democratic Party. He served in the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam War at the rank of corporal.

==Early life, education and career==
Vic Snyder was born in Medford, Oregon. He is a graduate of Medford High School (1965) and attended college at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon, where he was a member of Kappa Sigma. In 1967, after two years of college, Snyder volunteered for the United States Marine Corps. He served in South Vietnam with Headquarters Company of the US 1st Marine Division during the Vietnam War. He served for two years and attained the rank of corporal. Snyder earned a degree in Chemistry in 1975 from Willamette and earned his M.D. degree from the University of Oregon Health Sciences Center (now Oregon Health &amp; Science University) in Portland, Oregon in 1979.

Snyder moved to Little Rock, Arkansas and served his residency at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. In 1982 after completing his residency he worked as a family practice physician for 15 years. During this time he travelled overseas to volunteer his medical services at Cambodian refugee camps in Thailand, Salvadoran refugee camps in Honduras, and Ethiopian refugee camps in Sudan, as well as a Catholic mission hospital in Sierra Leone. From 1985 to 1988 Snyder attended the University of Arkansas at Little Rock School of Law to obtain his J.D. degree while still maintaining his medical practice.

==Arkansas Legislature==
In 1990, Snyder successfully ran for a seat in the Arkansas legislature and served in that body until 1996. In the Arkansas legislature, Snyder stepped into one of his earliest legislative controversies when he attempted to repeal the state&#x27;s aged &quot;Sodomy Laws&quot;. Ultimately, however, his efforts failed, and the sodomy laws stayed in effect until the state Supreme Court struck it down in &quot;Jegley v. Picado&quot; in March 2001. He also challenged the power of the Arkansas Highway Commission.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Armed Services
**Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (Chairman)
**Subcommittee on Military Personnel
*Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs
**Subcommittee on Health
*Joint Economic Committee

Snyder focuses on many traditionally liberal issues, including a particular interest in support for veteran&#x27;s and military families. He has a fairly liberal voting record for being an elected politician from the South and otherwise conservative-leaning Arkansas. Snyder voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, restrictions on abortion, banning lawsuits against gun manufacturers and distributors, bankruptcy reform, drilling in ANWR, and on October 10, 2002, he was among the 133 members of the House who voted against authorizing the invasion of Iraq; despite this, he regularly voted to fund the needs of soldiers stationed in Iraq. In addition, Snyder was one of only two Congressmen to vote against prosecuting Saddam Hussein.

On issues of free and expanded trade, Snyder differs with his party, especially his Southern populist colleagues. He has also opposed legislation cracking down on Wal-Mart, which is headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas.

==Political campaigns==

Snyder was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996 and was reelected in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008.

Snyder announced on January 15, 2010 that he would retire at the conclusion of his term which ended in 2010. A SurveyUSA poll released January 15, 2010 showed him trailing his Republican challenger, Tim Griffin, by 17 points, although this was early in the polling cycle.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, like most Arkansas Democrats, Snyder endorsed former U.S. Senator and former First Lady of Arkansas Hillary Clinton (D-New York) for President.

==Electoral history==












==Personal life==
Snyder’s congressional papers are housed at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock’s Center for Arkansas History and Culture.

<doc id="334697" wikidata="Q1367426" url="?curid=334697" title="George Wishart">
<text>George Wishart (also Wisehart; c. 15131 March 1546) was a Scottish Protestant Reformer and one of the early Protestant martyrs burned at the stake as a heretic.

George Wishart was the son of James and brother of Sir John of Pitarrow, both ranking themselves on the side of the Reformers. He was educated at the University of Aberdeen, then recently founded, and travelled afterwards on the Continent. It is thought that it was while he was abroad that he first turned attention to the study of the Reformed doctrines. He engaged for some time in teaching Greek at Montrose. Wishart afterwards proceeded to Cambridge and resided there for about six years, from 1538 to 1543. He returned to Scotland in the train of the Commissioners who had been appointed to arrange a marriage with Prince Edward and the Queen of Scots. He preached to the people with much acceptance at Montrose, Dundee, and throughout Ayrshire. On passing East to the Lothians, Wishart, who spoke latterly as in near prospect of death, was apprehended by Bothwell in the house of Cockburn, of Ormiston. He was carried captive to St. Andrews, where he was tried by a clerical Assembly, found guilty, and condemned as an obstinate heretic. The following day he was executed at the stake on Castle Green, his persecutor, Cardinal David Beaton or Bethune, looking on the scene from the windows of the castle, where he himself would be assassinated within three months.

==Life==
He belonged to a younger branch of the Wisharts of Pitarrow near Fordoun, Kincardineshire. His mother was Elizabeth, sister of Sir James Learmonth, married James Wishart of Pitarrow in April 1512. He was probably called George after his maternal grandfather of granduncle Prior George Leirmont, the name was certainly derived from his mother&#x27;s family. George&#x27;s father, James Wishart, died in May 1525, therefore, his mother, Elizabeth together with her brother, Sir James Learmonth of Balcomie, were the two people who were responsible for George&#x27;s upbringing. Some have suggested that he may have graduated M.A., probably at King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen, though others, including Wishart biographer Rev. Charles Rogers says that his name does not occur on the records of any Scottish college. He was certainly a student at the University of Leuven, from which he graduated in 1531. Around this time he translated the First Helvetic Confession into English from the Latin. He taught the New Testament in Greek as schoolmaster at Montrose in Angus, until investigated for heresy by the Bishop of Brechin in 1538. He fled to England, where a similar charge was brought against him at Bristol in the following year by Thomas Cromwell. Under examination by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer he recanted some utterances. In 1539 or 1540 he may have visited Germany and Switzerland, but by 1542 he had entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he studied and taught.

In 1543 he returned to Scotland, in the train of a Scottish embassy which had come to London to consider the treaty of marriage between Prince Edward (later Edward VI of England) and the infant Mary, Queen of Scots. He returned to Montrose, where again he taught Scripture.

He may have been the &quot;Scottish man called Wishart&quot; acting as a messenger to England for Alexander Crichton of Brunstane in a 1544 plot against Cardinal David Beaton. Some historians such as Alphons Bellesheim and Richard Watson Dixon have accepted this identification; others are sceptical. Other possibilities include a George Wishart, Baillie of Dundee, who allied himself with Beaton&#x27;s murderers; and Sir John Wishart (died 1576), afterwards a Scottish judge.

His career as an itinerant preacher began in 1544, from when he traveled Scotland from east to west. The story has been told by his disciple John Knox. He went from place to place, in danger of his life, denouncing the errors of the Papacy and the abuses in the churches of Montrose, Dundee (where he escaped an attempt on his life), Ayr, Perth, Edinburgh, Leith, Haddington (where Knox accompanied him) and elsewhere.

At Ormiston in East Lothian, in January 1546, he was seized by Lord Bothwell on the orders of Cardinal Beaton, taken to Elphinstone Castle, and transferred by order of the privy council to Edinburgh castle on 19 January 1546. Thence he was handed over to Beaton, who had a &quot;show trial&quot;, with John Lauder prosecuting Wishart. He was hanged on a gibbet and his body burned at St Andrews on 1 March 1546. Foxe and Knox attribute to him a prophecy of the death of the Cardinal, who was assassinated on 29 May following, partly in revenge for Wishart&#x27;s death.

Wishart&#x27;s preaching in 1544–45 helped popularise the teachings of Calvin and Zwingli in Scotland. He translated into English the first &quot;Helvetic Confession of Faith&quot; in 1536. At his trial he refused to accept that confession was a sacrament, denied free will, recognised the priesthood of all believing Christians, and rejected the notion that the infinite God could be &quot;comprehended in one place&quot; between &quot;the priest&#x27;s hands&quot;. He proclaimed that the true Church was where the Word of God was faithfully preached and the two dominical sacraments rightly administered.


==Memorials==
The Martyrs Memorial at St Andrews was erected to the honour of George Wishart, Patrick Hamilton, and other martyrs of the Reformation era.

Dundee&#x27;s East Port (also known as Cowgate Port), the remains of a gateway in the town&#x27;s walls, is known as the Wishart Arch. The Arch is the only surviving portion of the town&#x27;s walls, and probably survived owing to a story that George Wishart preached from it in 1544 to plague victims. However the connection of the Arch with Wishart has been described as &#x27;probably-mythical&#x27; and the structure is thought to have been built around 1590, long after Wishart&#x27;s death. Wishart was also commemorated in Dundee with a United Presbyterian church being named after him. Wishart church was built in Dundee&#x27; Cowgate in 1841 and could seat over 700 people. It was this church that the missionary Mary Slessor was a member of when she lived in Dundee. It was renamed Wishart Memorial Church in 1901, a year after it had become part of the United Free Church of Scotland, and 1929 became part of the Church of Scotland. In 1975 the church congregation was united with Dundee church and the building was sold to Dundee Cyrenians who turned it into a hostel for people with alcohol problems called the Wishart Centre. There is a house at Saint Kentigern College in Auckland, New Zealand, named after him. A lodge of the Scottish Orange Order, formed with a warrant in Dundee but often meeting in near by Forfar, is named The Wishart Arch Defenders in his honour.

<text>The Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (), commonly shortened to ERT (), is the state-owned public radio and television broadcaster of Greece.

==History==
===Overview===
ERT began broadcasting in 1938 as the Radio Broadcasting Service or YRE ().

Following a government decision, the original company was abolished on 11 June 2013, with its 2,656 employees protesting against the closure and continuing broadcasting via a satellite transmission using European Broadcasting Union equipment. The EBU also began providing Internet streaming of the ERT broadcast.

On 12 June 2013, the Greek government proposed a successor organization, New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television (), shortened to NERIT (), which launched in August 2013 as &quot;Public Television&quot; (). As protests against the decision of the government (Coalition of New Democracy, PASOK, DIMAR) continued, on 15 June Prime Minister Samaras proposed returning ERT to service immediately, by having an emergency committee rehire selected employees. This offer was rejected by the ERT employees and Samaras&#x27; coalition partners.

On 17 June 2013, following an appeal by ERT&#x27;s employees to the Council of State (Greece&#x27;s highest administrative court), the Council suspended the government&#x27;s decision to interrupt broadcasting and shut down ERT&#x27;s frequencies and ordered the Finance Minister and the minister responsible for media, signing the decision, to take &quot;all necessary organisational measures for the continuation of transmission of broadcasting services and operation of internet websites by a public broadcaster for the period until the establishment and operation of a new operator that will serve the public&#x27;s interest&quot;. In his ruling, the Council&#x27;s President found that the government&#x27;s decision violated Law 1730/1987 which requires &quot;the contribution by a public broadcaster to informing, educating and entertaining the Greek people and the diaspora&quot;. The Council&#x27;s appellate division upheld the original Temporary Injunction three days later.

Until 24 October 2013, ERT&#x27;s employees were able to offer the television programmes of NET (also simulcast in HD as ERT-HD) and ET3, and the radio programmes of ERA Athens-Thessaloniki and Third Programme through conventional means (analogue and digital TV, FM, medium and shortwave radio broadcasts) as well as over the Internet. At approximately 18:11 EEST, ERT lost their satellite capacity on the Astra 23.5°E satellite after successful lobbying by the Greek government to the capacity provider SES. That halted most conventional TV and radio broadcasts that received the feed from the satellite but did not affect the regional ERA affiliates that produced their programming locally, nor a large part of Athens which is served by a DVB-T transmitter located within the ERT HQ in Ayia Paraskevi. Web streaming was not affected at all.

, more than nine months after the decision to close down ERT, the striking workers still ran 17 radio stations (15 regional, two national) and a single TV channel (ET3), from the regional radio studios, and the ET3 Television Building in Thessaloniki. FM and AM transmissions continued throughout Greece with some interruptions and shortwave transmissions continued with weaker transmission power. All radio stations were also available as web streams. The TV channel was sporadically transmitted by conventional means (analogue transmitters in Thessaloniki) and was always available as a web stream.

In April 2015, the Hellenic Parliament approved the draft of re-opening ERT S.A. and also voted and approved the draft of re-opening this broadcaster.

As of 11 June 2015, ERT again started broadcasting, replacing NERIT.

===1938–2013===
ERT began broadcasting in 1938 as the Radio Broadcasting Service or YRE (), initially limited to radio services from Athens, with the Athens Radio Station based in the Zappeion. During the Axis occupation of Greece, the service was renamed as the Limited Hellenic Radio Company or AERE (). After Liberation, in 1945 the service was reorganized as the National Radio Foundation or EIR (), still based at Zappeion. The radio services were expanded to three national radio services as well as international radio services for emigrant Greeks. EIR was one of 23 founding broadcasting organizations of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950.

Test television broadcasts began in 1965 and full TV service began in 1966. In 1970, the company was renamed National Radio and Television Foundation or EIRT (). In 1966, the Hellenic Armed Forces began their own TV station, the Armed Forces Television or TED (), renamed in 1970 as the Armed Forces Information Service or YENED (). Television was prominently used as a propaganda medium by the Greek junta. YENED kept its name and military orientation until the early 1980s, when it was renamed ERT2 by the then PASOK government. On 1 September 1987, a third station was added – ET3, based in Thessaloniki, with mostly regional programming focused on Macedonia and the rest of Northern Greece.

During the first 20 years of TV services in Greece, ERT broadcasting was limited, starting at around 5pm to between midnight and 2am. Since 1997 the three ERT TV channels are known as ET1, NET and ET3, and broadcast round the clock. ET1 is an entertainment channel whereas NET is focused on news services. ET3 is still focused on Northern Greece issues, although it broadcasts nationwide.

ERT was a major national sponsor and the official broadcaster of the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. It has been broadcasting the Olympic Games in Greece since the Mexico City Games of 1968. It also broadcasts IAAF games while it is shown on privately owned channels mainly in the United States. Today it broadcasts documentaries, some from the private sector, and a few animated shows. With the introduction of independent privately owned channels in Greece in the late 1980s, programme quality changed to a more commercial variety, in order to survive the fierce competition for ratings. This was a major shift in the network&#x27;s principles that was dominated by wider variety, alleged &quot;higher quality&quot; programmes including documentaries and World Cinema.

On 19 August 2011 the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation announced a planned restructuring of the company; ERT&#x27;s main channels became NET and ET3, while ET1 was incorporated into the program of NET and ET3. Additionally the digital channels Cine+ and Sport+ ceased broadcasting, and their programming were again incorporated into that of the company&#x27;s two major domestic channels. ERT World also saw changes in its programming to reflect the needs of the Greek diaspora as identified by a survey conducted by ERT. The Minister of State also said that the company would become &quot;public&quot; but no longer &quot;state-owned&quot;.

===Closure===
At 17:45 EEST (UTC+3) on 11 June 2013, the Greek spokesperson, Simos Kedikoglou, announced ERT would close by the end of the day. ERT shutdown caused the loss of jobs for 2,500 employees.

ERT was dissolved by a Common Ministerial Decision that was enacted by virtue of Article 14B of Law 3429/2005 (regarding the dissolution, merger and restructuring of public companies) as amended by an urgent government Legislative Ordinace (FEK 139/11.06.2013, Issue A&#x27;). Despite running a budget surplus on income from a license fee outside the state budget, in a televised statement, Simos Kedikoglou, the minister responsible for media and the government&#x27;s spokesperson, said that the ERT was a &quot;haven of waste&quot; that cost more and had fewer viewers than private stations.

Later in the evening, some of ERT workers managed to continue the broadcasting via Ustream. Police forced their way into at least one of the transmitting stations, and all ERT transmitters were closed down around Greece, as was eventually the worldwide ERT World feed. Using satellite offices and other spaces that had not been closed down, ERT journalists continued to broadcast to the Internet. The nearest ERT Transmitters to Athens closed at approximately 23:17 local time. 20 seconds later, channel 902TV (the communist party channel) retransmits the ERT signal, although a few minutes later, the Greek government called Digea, the digital television service, to close the signal [902&#x27;s] due to rebroadcasting the signal without permission, and so 902 was closed for a period of time. This action was deemed unacceptable by most Greek citizens due to the Greek Government shutting down ERT without consulting the National Council of Radio and Television, the official body of Radio and Television in Greece.

On 12 June at noon local time, the AS and IP range of ERT, the official domain names &quot;ert.gr&quot;, &quot;ert3.gr&quot;, and &quot;voiceofgreece.gr&quot; were cancelled in the Greek Internet registry, meaning that live broadcasts on the Internet (ERT LIVE) have stopped, as well as the publication of all news articles. Emails sent to the broadcasters are no longer delivered. Other Internet assets registered by ERT are at risk of being closed (because their owner and contact address are no longer valid), notably the official Facebook page and Twitter account. ERT LIVE is relayed by other sites, such as the University of Greece.

The European Broadcasting Union was quick to criticise the closure, issuing a statement the same evening where they expressed &quot;profound dismay on behalf of Europe&#x27;s entire public service media&quot; and urged the prime minister to reverse the decision. The EBU made the ERT stream available on satellite to its members, declaring as well that &quot;to be in the EBU, you must be a broadcaster, and so we will continue keeping ERT on the EBU council&quot; as said by the director, Ingrid Delterne.

Alexis Tsipras, the leftwing opposition leader, who would later become Prime Minister, expressed dismay in regards of ERT&#x27;s shutdown and described it as &quot;illegal&quot;.

===NERIT===

On 12 June 2013 a Greek government spokesperson, Simos Kedikoglou, announced the formation of a new public service broadcaster, New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television. The company&#x27;s services were expected to launch on 29 August 2013. The service provider employed between 1,000 and 1,200 and was funded by advertising and tax contributions.

Prior to its launch on television, a temporary state television broadcaster known as Dimosia Tileorasi (English: Public Television) launched on 10 July 2013 on the frequencies of ERT, launching as Elliniki Dimosia Tileorasi (English: Greek Public Television). It was closed on 4 May 2014, in order for it to be replaced by NERIT.

===Relaunch of ERT===
In 2015, the government, under Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, restored ERT as Greece&#x27;s public broadcaster and NERIT ceased broadcasting on 11 June 2015, at 6:00 EEST.

==Programming==
==Funding==
ERT is mainly funded by a license fee, which is also paid with the electricity bill (along with other applicable taxes) which represents the vast majority of resources in the public group. The fee was 4.74 euros per month in 2013, equal to 56.88 euros annually, but was reduced to 3 euros per month upon the launch of ERT. It is not connected with actual ownership of a TV set.

There are modest grants from the government for contributing to educational public missions. However, since 2008, some commercial resources from advertisers (even though the channels have lost significant parts of audiences) and the economic crisis in Greece has severely impacted the profitability of advertising and of commercial cooperation for the joint production of programs, as well as the collection of license fees on electricity bills.

==Corporate identity==
The opening bars of &quot;Tsopanakos Imouna&quot; () is ERT&#x27;s corporate theme music, as well as their interval signal on radio.

ERT is the holder of the biggest audiovisual archive in Greece, which includes also significant moments of modern Greek history.

<text>William Lewis Morton (13 December 1908 – 7 December 1980) was a Canadian historian who specialized in the development of the Canadian west. Along with Arthur R. M. Lower and Donald Creighton he is regarded as one of the dominant Canadian historians of his generation.

== Biography ==
Morton was born on 13 December 1908 in Gladstone, Manitoba. He won a Rhodes Scholarship and attended the University of Oxford, where he studied history. He returned to Canada to teach at Brandon College, the University of Manitoba, and then at Trent University. W. L. Morton served as head of the Department of History and Provost of University College of the University of Manitoba. He helped initiate the Canadian Centenary Series project and served as the Executive Editor for the nineteen-volume authoritative history of Canada. He served as president of the Canadian Historical Association from 1959 to 1960. Morton was one of the most prominent early faculty members of Trent University at Peterborough, Ontario, and was the first Master of the university&#x27;s Champlain College.

Morton was a strong supporter of the Progressive Conservative Party and was very much a Red Tory. In 1969, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada &quot;for his contributions as an historian, teacher and author of several books on Canadian History.&quot;

Morton was a passionate nationalist and a conservative who fought against the liberal ideas that dominated Canadian thought after 1960, when the younger generation focused more on race, class, and gender as opposed to the national themes that intrigued Morton.

Morton died on 7 December 1980 in Medicine Hat, Alberta.

<text>The following is a list of numbered [[state highway]]s in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Signed state highways in New York, referred to as &quot;touring routes&quot; by the New York State Department of Transportation, are numbered from 1 to 899. A large number of unsigned state highways, known as &quot;reference routes&quot;, are numbered from 900 to 999 and carry a suffix. Four reference routes have been signed as touring routes and as such are listed on this page.

The first set of routes in New York were assigned in 1924, replacing a series of unsigned legislative routes that had existed since 1908. Initially, there were only 29 routes; by the late 1920s, there were several dozen highways. In the 1930 state highway renumbering, some of these routes were reconfigured or renumbered while hundreds of other, smaller routes were assigned. Since that time, routes have been added and removed from the state highway system at various times for reasons ranging from the construction and/or removal of highways to the result of &quot;maintenance swaps&quot;, or transfers of highway maintenance from the state of New York to lower levels of government and vice versa. State-maintained portions of routes have reference markers, small, green signs that are posted approximately every one-tenth mile along the side of the roadway.


==Current routes==

<doc id="334703" wikidata="Q1173680" url="?curid=334703" title="David Beaton">
<text>David Beaton (also Beton or Bethune; 29 May 1546) was Archbishop of St Andrews and the last Scottish cardinal prior to the Reformation.

==Life==
David Beaton was said to be the fifth son of fourteen children born to John Beaton (Bethune) of Balfour (d. 1532) in the county of Fife, and his wife Isobel Monypenny (d. 1541). The Bethunes of Balfour were part of Clan Bethune, the Scottish branch of the noble French House of Bethune. The Cardinal is said to have been born in 1494. He was educated at the universities of St Andrews and Glasgow, and in his sixteenth year was sent to Paris, where he studied civil and canon law. In 1519 King James V of Scotland named him ambassador in France.

In 1520, his uncle, James Beaton, Archbishop of Glasgow, named David Beaton Rector and Prebendary at Cambuslang. After his uncle became Archbishop of St. Andrews in 1522, he resigned the position of Commendator of Arbroath in favour of his nephew. In 1525 David Beaton returned from France and took a seat as Lord Abbot of Arbroath Abbey in the Scottish Parliament. In 1528 the King named him Lord Privy Seal.

Between 1533 and 1542 he acted several times as King James V of Scotland&#x27;s ambassador to France. He took a leading part in the negotiations connected with the King&#x27;s marriages, first with Madeleine of France, and afterwards with Mary of Guise. In 1537 he was made coadjutor to his uncle at St. Andrews, with right of succession.

In December 1537 Beaton was made Bishop of Mirepoix in Languedoc on the recommendation of King Francis I, and consecrated the following summer. Presumably he was ordained around that time. Also in 1538 he was appointed a Cardinal by Pope Paul III, under the title of St Stephen in the Caelian Hill. In February 1539 Cardinal Beaton succeeded his uncle as Archbishop of St. Andrews. In 1544, he was made Papal legate in Scotland.

Politically, Beaton was preoccupied with the maintenance of the Franco-Scottish alliance, and opposing Anglophile political attitudes, which were associated with the clamour for Protestant reform in Scotland.

Relations became strained between James V and his uncle, Henry VIII of England, who sought to detach the Catholic Church in Scotland from its allegiance to the Holy See and bring it into subjection to himself. Henry sent two successive embassies to Scotland to urge James to follow his example in renouncing the authority of the Pope in his dominions. King James declined to be drawn into Henry&#x27;s plans and refused to leave his kingdom for a meeting with Henry. Hostilities broke out between the two kingdoms in 1542. The Cardinal was blamed by many for the war with England that led to the defeat at Solway Moss in November 1542.

==During Mary&#x27;s reign==

James V died at Falkland Palace on 14 December 1542. Beaton tried to become one of the regents for the infant sovereign Mary, Queen of Scots. He based his claim on an alleged will of the late King; but the will was generally regarded as forged, and The 2nd Earl of Arran, heir presumptive to the throne, was declared regent. A copy of the alleged will was preserved by Regent Arran. Dated 14 December 1542 in the King&#x27;s bedchamber at Falkland Palace, it was witnessed by James Learmonth of Dairsie, Master Household; Henry Kemp of Thomastoun, Gentleman of the Chamber; Michael Durham, the King&#x27;s doctor; John Tennent, William Kirkcaldy of Grange, Master Michael Dysart, Preceptor of St Anthony&#x27;s at Leith; John Jordan, Rector of Yetham; Francis Aikman, perfumerer, and others at the bedside. However, the clerk who wrote the instrument, Henry Balfour, a canon of Dunkeld, was not a recognised notary.

By order of the Regent, Beaton was committed to the custody of Lord Seton, and imprisoned at Dalkeith Palace and then Blackness Castle. A papal interdict followed the arrest of the Cardinal Primate, according to which all churches of the country should be closed and administering the sacraments should be suspended.

With Beaton out of power, the Anglophile party persuaded Regent Arran to make a marriage treaty with England on behalf of the infant Queen, and to appoint a number of Protestant preachers. The treaties signed at Greenwich in July 1543 stipulated that Mary would be accompanied by an English nobleman/gentleman (and his wife) until she was ten years old and afterwards would reside in England until the time of her marriage. The union of the thrones of England and Scotland which the treaty envisaged was controversial from the start. Its Anglo-centric policy was resisted by many who preferred to continue the Auld Alliance with France. Resistance to the treaty resulted in a surge in the popularity of the French faction and the release of Beaton from prison. The Treaty of Greenwich was rejected by the Scottish Parliament on 11 December 1543, leading to eight years of Anglo-Scottish conflict known as the Rough Wooing. In 1543 Beaton regained power, having earlier drawn up the &quot;Secret Bond&quot; against the marriage. Two English invasions followed – and for these many blamed Beaton.

In December 1545 Beaton arranged for the arrest, trial and execution of Protestant preacher George Wishart, who on 1 March 1546 was strangled and afterwards burned. Wishart had many sympathisers, and this led to the assassination of the Cardinal soon afterwards.

==Death==

Plots against Cardinal Beaton had begun circulating as early as 1544.
The conspirators were led by Norman Leslie, master of Rothes, and William Kirkcaldy of Grange. The Leslies had suffered from the expansion of Beaton&#x27;s interest in Fife; while Kirkcaldy&#x27;s uncle, James Kirkcaldy of Grange, held Protestant sympathies and had been removed in 1543 as treasurer of the realm, through Beaton&#x27;s influence. They were joined by John Leslie of Parkhill, one of the Fife lairds angered at the murder of Wishart. Leslie and Kirkcaldy managed to obtain admission to St Andrews Castle at daybreak of 29 May 1546, killing the porter in the process. Leslie, Kirckcaldy, and Peter Carmichael of Balmadie used their daggers to stab the cardinal to death, mutilated the corpse, and hung it from a castle window. 

At the time it was widely believed that his death was in the interests of Henry VIII of England, who regarded Beaton as the chief obstacle to his policy in Scotland; the cardinal&#x27;s murder was certainly a significant point in the eventual triumph of Protestantism north of the Border.

At the time of his death, Beaton was Lord Chancellor of Scotland, Archbishop of St Andrews, and Cardinal Legate in Scotland. He was succeeded as Archbishop of Saint Andrews by Dr. John Hamilton.

==Marion Ogilvy==
Cardinal Beaton&#x27;s mistress, Marion Ogilvy, was born in 1500, the youngest daughter of James Ogilvy, 1st Lord Ogilvy of Airlie. After the deaths of her parents, she managed the family estates in Angus. Around 1520 she met and fell in love with David Beaton. They lived together in Ethie Castle and produced eight children. According to Margaret H.B. Sanderson, their relationship, which appeared little different from marriage, deeply offended fellow Catholics who desired the Counter-Reformation. Furthermore, the double standard, under which the Cardinal prosecuted Protestants who advocated the marriage of the clergy for heresy, yet lived in blatant violation of his own vow of clerical celibacy, proved highly damaging in the long run to the Catholic Church in Scotland.

Cardinal Beaton&#x27;s oldest surviving son, David Beaton of Melgund, converted to Protestantism, and later became master of the household to James VI and to Anne of Denmark. His daughter Margaret married David Lindsay, 10th Earl of Crawford, and Agnes married Alexander Gordon of Gight.

<text>Henry Wardlaw (died 6 April 1440) was a Scottish church leader, Bishop of St Andrews and founder of the University of St Andrews.

==Ancestors==
He was descended from an ancient Saxon family which came to Scotland with Edgar Atheling, and was hospitably received by Malcolm Canmore. His grandfather, Sir H. Wardlaw of Torry, Fifeshire, married a niece of Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland, and had by her Andrew, his successor, and Walter Wardlaw (d. 1390), Bishop of Glasgow, who is said to have been made a cardinal by the antipope Clement VII in 1381. Sir Andrew married the daughter and heiress of James de Valoniis, and had Walter and Henry, the bishop. In 1378 Cardinal Wardlaw petitioned the pope for a canonry of Glasgow with expectation of a prebend for his nephew, who must have been then a mere boy, as he lived for sixty-two years afterwards.

==Early life==
He was educated at the universities of Oxford and of Paris. In the book of the procurators of the English nation in the latter university his name appears among the &#x27;determinantes&#x27; of 1383. In a petition to the pope of 1388 he is described as &#x27;a licentiate in arts who has studied civil law for two years at Orleans.&#x27; He afterwards studied the canon law, and took the degree of doctor. During the papal schism Scotland was on the side of the anti-popes, and, through the favour of Antipope Clement VII and Antipope Benedict XIII (Peter de Luna), Wardlaw held simultaneously canonries and prebends in Glasgow, Moray, and Aberdeen, the precentorships of Glasgow and Moray, and the church of Cavers.

==Bishop==
He passed some time at Avignon, and it was while at the papal court that he was chosen Bishop of St Andrews; he was consecrated in 1403. Returning to Scotland, he acted as tutor to the future King James I of Scotland, and finished the work of restoring the cathedral at St Andrews. He greatly improved the interior and enriched it with encaustic tiles and stained-glass windows. He also built the Gare bridge at the mouth of the Eden, which was then considered one of the finest in Scotland. Having helped to bring about the release of James from his captivity in England, he crowned the king in May 1424, and afterwards acted as one of his principal advisers. He appears to have been an excellent bishop. The chief blot on his episcopate was the burning of John Resby, an English priest, at Perth in 1407, and of Pavel Kravař, a Bohemian, at St. Andrews in 1432, for teaching the tenets of Wycliffe. He does not appear to have been himself an active promoter of persecution. Resby was apprehended by Lawrence of Lindores, and the king conferred the abbey of Melrose on John Fogo for his zeal in convicting Kravař. It is no excuse that the spirit of persecution then raged throughout Christendom, and that the Scottish parliament in 1425 enacted that all bishops should make inquisition of Lollards and others considered by Rome to be heretics in their dioceses.

==University of St Andrews==
Wardlaw&#x27;s chief claim to fame is the fact that he was the founder of the University of St Andrews, the first university in Scotland. He issued the charter of foundation in February 1411, and the privileges of the new seat of learning were confirmed by a bull of the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII, dated 28 August 1413. The university was to be &quot;an impregnable rampart of doctors and masters to resist heresy.&quot;

<text>Schlitterbahn is an American brand of water parks and resorts owned by Six Flags Entertainment Corporation. It was previously a company family owned and operated by the Henry family that was based in New Braunfels, Texas. Schlitterbahn opened its first location, Schlitterbahn Waterpark Resort, in 1979. At its peak, the company consisted of five outdoor waterparks, two indoor waterparks, and three resorts.

Schlitterbahn&#x27;s outdoor water parks are seasonally operated, typically open from late April through mid-September, while its indoor locations operate year-round. Two parks are located in Texas.

On June 13, 2019, Cedar Fair entered an agreement to acquire two of Schlitterbahn&#x27;s properties in Galveston and New Braunfels for $261 million. The deal, which closed in early July 2019, gave Cedar Fair the option to purchase Schlitterbahn Waterpark Kansas City for $6 million within 120 days of the transaction, which they declined to do. Additionally, the rights to the Schlitterbahn name were included in the acquisition. Cedar Fair merged with Six Flags in 2024.

==Current parks==

===New Braunfels, Texas===

The first of the parks was in New Braunfels and opened in 1979. The park was named Schlitterbahn (&quot;slippery road&quot; in German) because of the local area&#x27;s German heritage. It originally consisted of four waterslides. The park expanded three times. Surfenberg was the first part of the expansion and had the world&#x27;s first inland surfing ride, the Boogie Bahn, in 1992, created the first uphill water coaster, the Dragon Blaster in 1994. In 1996 the next section opened - Blastenhoff - and featured the world&#x27;s first wave river, the Torrent, and the world&#x27;s most award-winning uphill water coaster, the Master Blaster. In 2011, the park expanded again, adding The Falls, the world&#x27;s longest tubing river, featuring rapids and tube chutes.

As of 2022, the park has won Amusement Today&#x27;s Golden Ticket Award for Best Waterpark for 24 years straight; the streak began with the inception of the award. In total, Schlitterbahn New Braunfels has received 42 Golden Ticket Awards. As of 2014, the park employed 2,000 seasonal workers.

===Galveston, Texas===

The 26-acre Schlitterbahn park in Galveston opened in 2006. The park features the most thrill rides of any of the Schlitterbahn parks and is home to the world&#x27;s former record holder of the world&#x27;s tallest water coaster, MASSIV, as it lost its record to Tsunami Surge at Hurricane Harbor Chicago at 86 feet tall. MASSIV opened in 2016 and features the most current technology including water and power saving features never used before. Although it had lost its record for the tallest water coaster, MASSIV still holds the Guinness Book of World Records title for the Tallest Water Coaster and is tall.

==Former parks==

===South Padre Island, Texas===
The park in South Padre Island opened in 2001. An indoor section opened in 2012. The park featured Transportainment - a system where guests can ride through the majority of the park&#x27;s attractions while floating in their tubes. In fact, this park had floating queue lines for three of the four uphill water coasters. When the Henrys sold the company to Cedar Fair, they retained the ownership of this property and rebranded it. The park was rebranded as Beach Park at Isla Blanca in December 2019.

===Corpus Christi, Texas===
In May 2012, Schlitterbahn announced that it would move forward with plans to begin construction of a new water park in the Corpus Christi-Padre Island area. It was announced that it would open during the summer of 2013, but due to various delays, groundbreaking didn&#x27;t take place until February 2013. A plan for the city included a marina, the Schlitterbahn water park with lodging, and a golf course. Vendors complained, and then sued, Schlitterbahn over $500,000 in unpaid bills on the Corpus Christi project. After several months, Schlitterbahn paid the vendors and threw them a party.
Schlitterbahn Corpus Christi opened on June 20, 2015, with a full-service restaurant, the Veranda, two kids&#x27; areas, the Krystal river system, the Sky Blaster, and the Aquaveyer. In 2016 the southern end of the park opened along with a resort. Christened Schlitterbahn Riverpark - Corpus Christi, the park featured nearly of river and multiple blasters. In 2017, Padre&#x27;s Plunge, a SkyTrans Manufacturing Shoot the Chute, opened in the southern end of the park. It had previously operated as &quot;Buzzsaw Falls&quot; at Alabama Splash Adventure. This park featured four types of rivers, two children&#x27;s areas, a massive swim-up bar, a stage for concerts, a resort with several event spaces, and a full-service restaurant.

On May 1, 2018, IBC Bank took over ownership of the park at foreclosure auction. Schlitterbahn continued to operate it while a new owner was sought. The property was rebranded as Waves Resort Corpus Christi. After not operating during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the park was closed. In 2021, the park was demolished.

===Kansas City, Kansas===

The first phase of the park opened in July 2009. The park opened each year in May. After a fatal accident in 2016, Cedar Fair elected not to purchase the property along with the other Schlitterbahn parks. The park did not open in the 2019 season and was razed in 2021.

==Proposed projects==

===Fort Lauderdale, Florida===
A long-stalled project in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Schlitterbahn received final approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to construct a 64-acre water park at the old Fort Lauderdale Stadium. The initial project would have used portions of the old stadium to construct a castle-like entrance to include lodging, dining and shopping facilities. Other projects included incorporating the neighboring Lockhart Stadium into the plan by expanding the park around that stadium.

A lawsuit between Fort Lauderdale and nearby Rapids Water Park delayed the project. On March 29, 2017, federal U.S. District Judge Jose Martinez ruled against the City of Fort Lauderdale in the case stating they &quot;did not follow their own charter&quot; in awarding the property lease to Schlitterbahn without conducting a competitive bid process and declared the lease &quot;invalid, null and void.&quot;

Premier Parks, LLC eventually won the bid for the project with plans to build a Wet&#x27;n&#x27;Wild brand water park on the site. However, in September 2018, the CEO of Premier, Kieran Burke, cancelled the deal.

===Cedar Park, Texas===
While the Henry Family owned and operated the chain, there were plans for a waterpark in Cedar Park, Texas.
==Appearance in TV/Movies==

* Schlitterbahn New Braunfels appeared in Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over as a fictional water park named &#x27;Agua Park.&#x27; In the film, the main character, Juni Cortez, helps a girl, played by Selena Gomez, figure out why the water in her park was shut off but she discovers that the real owners were the reason.

==Incidents==

*On March 6, 2013, Nicolas &quot;Nico&quot; Benavidez, a 20-year-old seasonal employee at Schlitterbahn South Padre Island, was fatally injured and a maintenance supervisor seriously injured when a wave generation machine they were inside for maintenance was activated, crushing them between the gate of the machine and the wall. Benavidez was left on life support for organ donation and later died from the injuries on March 11. OSHA investigated and fined Schlitterbahn $96,000 for six safety violations related to the fatal incident.
*On August 7, 2016, 10-year-old Caleb Thomas Schwab, son of Kansas representative Scott Schwab, was decapitated while riding the Verrückt, a water raft ride touted as the world&#x27;s tallest water slide. He died before reaching the bottom. Two other unrelated riders in the same raft sustained injuries. The ride was decommissioned and later demolished. The park settled with all parties in 2016, with the Schwab family receiving nearly $20 million. In March 2018, a Wyandotte County grand jury filed indictments against the park and three employees, including the co-owner, Verrückt&#x27;s designer and a former park executive. The indictment accused the park and its employees of negligence, as well as concealing design flaws and other issues with the ride. On February 22, 2019, all charges were dropped by Judge Robert Burns against the construction company and Schlitterbahn owners due to prosecutorial misconduct.

==Autoroutes==

The Autoroute system in Quebec is a network of expressways which operate under the same principle of controlled access as the Interstate Highway System in the United States or the 400-Series Highways in neighbouring Ontario.

==Trans-Canada==
The Trans-Canada Highway through Quebec does not have a distinct number, but rather piggybacks over the provincial highway system, mainly autoroutes, and is signed with a numberless TCH shield next to the numbered provincial highway shield. As no single provincial highway crosses the entire province between Ontario and New Brunswick, the main Trans-Canada route follows (from east to west) Autoroutes 40, 25, 20 and 85; with A-85 being interspersed with Route 185 as construction to upgrade the latter to autoroute standards progresses.

<doc id="334716" wikidata="Q149405" url="?curid=334716" title="Bearded seal">
<text>The bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), also called the square flipper seal, is a medium-sized pinniped that is found in and near to the Arctic Ocean. It gets its generic name from two Greek words (&quot;eri&quot; and &quot;gnathos&quot;) that refer to its heavy jaw. The other part of its Linnaean name means bearded and refers to its most characteristic feature, the conspicuous and very abundant whiskers. When dry, these whiskers curl very elegantly, giving the bearded seal a &quot;raffish&quot; look.

Bearded seals are the largest northern phocid. They have been found to weigh as much as with the females being the largest. However, male and female bearded seals are not very dimorphic.

The only member of the genus Erignathus, the bearded seal is unique in that it is an intermediate. Bearded seals belong to the family Phocidae which contains two subfamilies: Phocinae and Monachinae. The bearded seal possesses characteristics of both of these subfamilies.

Fossils first described in 2002 indicate that, during the Pleistocene epoch, bearded seals ranged as far south as South Carolina.

==Description==
Distinguishing features of this earless seal include square fore flippers and thick bristles on its muzzle. Adults are greyish-brown in colour, darker on the back; rarely with a few faint spots on the back or dark spots on the sides. Occasionally the face and neck are reddish brown. Bearded seal pups are born with a greyish-brown natal fur with scattered patches of white on the back and head. The bearded seal is unique in the subfamily Phocinae in having two pairs of teats, a feature it shares with monk seals.

Bearded seals reach about in nose-to-tail length and from in weight. The female seal is larger than the male, meaning that they are sexually dimorphic.

Bearded seals, along with ringed seals, are a major food source for polar bears. They are also an important food source for the Inuit of the Arctic coast. The Inuit language name for the seal is &quot;ugjuk&quot; (plural: &quot;ugjuit&quot;) or &quot;oogrook&quot; or &quot;oogruk&quot;. The Inuit preferred the ringed seal for food and light; the meat would be eaten and the blubber burnt in the &quot;kudlik&quot; (stone lamp). The skin of the bearded seal is tougher than regular seal and was used to make shoes, whips, dog sled harnesses, to cover a wooden frame boat, the &quot;Umiak&quot; and in constructing summer tents known as &quot;tupiq&quot;.

The body fat content of a bearded seal is about 25–40%.

== Distribution ==
Bearded seals are extant in Arctic and subarctic regions. In the Pacific region, they extend from the Chukchi Sea in the Arctic, south into the Bering Sea where they span from Bristol Bay on the Alaskan coast to the Sea of Okhotsk on the Russian coast, up to but not including the northern coast of Japan. In the Arctic Ocean, they are found along the northern coasts of Russia, Norway, Canada, and Alaska, including the Norwegian Archipelago of Svalbard and Canadian Arctic Archipelago. In the Atlantic, Bearded seals are found along the northern coast of Iceland, the east and west coasts of Greenland and the Canadian mainland as far south as Labrador.

Although the range typically only extends down into subarctic areas bearded seals have been seen in Japan and China as well as extremely far south of their range in Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, Spain and Portugal.

==Hunting and diet==
Primarily benthic, bearded seals feed on a variety of small prey found along the ocean floor, including clams, squid, and fish. Their whiskers serve as feelers in the soft bottom sediments. Adults tend not to dive very deep, favoring shallow coastal areas no more than deep. Pups up to one year old, however, will venture much deeper, diving as deep as . In a study conducted during the summer months, the seals have been found to feed on invertebrates such as anemones, sea cucumbers, and polychaete worms. The same study found that sculpins and Arctic cod made up most of their summer diet. Sculpin were also found to be the largest fish consumed by the seals. Bearded seals are capable of preying on pelagic and demersal fish in addition to their benthic prey.

==Reproduction and lifecycle==

Bearded seals give birth in the spring. In the Canadian Arctic, seal pupping occurs in May. In Svalbard, bearded seals reach sexual maturity at 5 or 6 years of age. Further south, in Alaska, most pups are born in late April. Pups are born on small drifting ice floes in shallow waters, usually weighing around . They enter the water only hours after they are born, and quickly become proficient divers. Mothers care for the pups for 18–24 days, during which time the pups grow at an average rate of per day. During this time, pups consume an average of of milk a day. By the time they are weaned, the pups have grown to about .

Just before the pups are weaned, a new mating cycle takes place. Females ovulate at the end of their lactation period, but remain close to their pups, ready to defend them if necessary. During the mating season, male seals will &quot;sing&quot;, emitting a long-drawn-out warbling note that ends in a sort of moan or sigh. This sound may attract females, or may be used by the males to proclaim their territory or their readiness for breeding. Males occupy the same areas from one year to the next.

Like many Arctic mammals, bearded seals employ a reproductive strategy known as delayed implantation. This means that the blastocyst is not implanted for two months after fertilization, most often becoming implanted in July. Thus, the seal&#x27;s total gestation period is around eleven months, though its active gestation period is nine months.

Natural predators of the bearded seal include polar bears, who rely on these seals as a major food source. Killer whales also prey on these seals, sometimes overturning ice floes to reach them. Walruses also eat these seals, mainly pups, but such predation is rare.

Bearded seals are believed to live up to 31 years.

== Vocalization ==
The vocalizations produced by the bearded seal are unique, possibly because their trachea is different from that of other Northern Pacific phocids. A majority of the rings in the trachea are incomplete with only a membrane attaching the two ends.

The sounds of the bearded seal usually consist of a long oscillating trill lasting for a minute or more followed by a short, deep moan. This &quot;song&quot; is often repeated frequently. The number of call types within a population can vary geographically, with four types found in Svalbard and eleven in the Western Canadian Arctic. The most frequent sounds are trills, moans, and sweeps. A sweep can be compared to a short trill.

Bearded seals produce distinct trills from late March to late June, with a decline in rhythmicity in late May and June. This timeline coincides with their breeding and pupping season, which is from April to May. The repetitive and transmittable nature of bearded seal trills leads researchers to believe that they are utilized for communication, likely during courtship and breeding. Males use these sounds to establish mating territories and communicate their fitness, but it is likely that females produce these sounds as well.

Underwater, bearded seal trills can be heard from a distance of over , with some types of sounds traveling farther than others. This makes it possible for one animal to communicate with another animal that is far away, although acoustic degradation does occur as the sound passes through the environment. A seal must produce a trill with a sound-pressure of at least 100 dB at 1 m in order for the sound to propagate 30 km, meaning that bearded seals can likely produce sounds at this level.

==Conservation status==
On March 28, 2008, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service initiated a status review under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to determine if listing this species under the ESA is warranted. All bearded seals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and determined by the IUCN to be classified as a &quot;least concern&quot; for extinction. This classification was determined due to various factors including, widespread distribution, stable population size, as well as alternating prey resources. NOAA determined that the factors influencing any change in conservancy status of the bearded seal may include: loss of sea ice by climate change, bycatch from commercial fishing gear, and hunting. Their main predators include polar bears; however, typically pups around age 2 are attacked within birthing lairs, leaving older juveniles and adults commonly unharmed. Due to climate change, factors such as loss of sea ice, as well as decrease in prey population may create negative results on the bearded seal population in the future. Therefore, monitoring of the species as well as influences of human activity, will be vital to ensure species stability.

==Subspecies==
There are two recognized subspecies of this seal:

While the validity of these subspecies has been questioned, and is not yet supported by any molecular data, analysis of the animals&#x27; calls does indicate a differentiation between different populations.
== Evolutionary history ==
Bearded seal fossils have been found to be as old as the early to mid Pleistocene. These early fossils were found in northern regions like England, Alaska, and Sweden, as well as the North Sea and the Champlain Sea.

Bearded seals, like all true seals, belong to the family Phocidae which is one of the three families in the clade Pinnipedia, along with Otariidae and Odobenidae. Pinnipeds are thought to have originated 27 to 25 million years ago during the late Oligocene period. One hypothesis for the evolution of pinnipeds is that pinnipeds are a diphyletic group and otariids and odobenids are more closely related to bears, and phocids are more closely related to mustelids like weasels. Another hypothesis suggests that pinnipeds are a monophyletic group that descended from a single ancestor. This has been more supported by phylogenetic analysis than the diphylectic hypothesis. One such study suggests that phocids are sister taxa to the common ancestor to both otariids and odobenids.

Bearded seals belong to the subfamily Phocinae (Northern Hemisphere seals). Phocinae can be further divided into three clades: Erignathini (bearded seals), Cystophorini (hooded seals), and Phocini (all remaining genera). Bearded seals are the sister taxa to the common ancestor of Cystophorini and Phocini.

<doc id="334717" wikidata="Q2303581" url="?curid=334717" title="Volvo PV444/544">
<text>The Volvo PV is a series of two-door, four-passenger car models — the PV444 and the PV544 — made by Volvo from 1947 to 1965. During World War II&#x27;s early stages, Volvo decided that a new, smaller car that could deliver good fuel economy would assure the company&#x27;s future. A raw materials shortage during the war drove home the point that an automobile should be smaller, and also complicated Volvo&#x27;s ability to mass-produce the product. In 1944, when the car was finally introduced to a car-hungry public, response was very positive and orders poured in from the Swedish population. It was another three years though, until 1947, before series production began.

The PV quickly earned a reputation for being strong and rugged, although the design was considered outdated from early on. The PV also competed successfully, in the American SCCA class but also internationally, with a second-hand PV544 memorably winning the Safari Rally in 1965.

No PV 544 were produced in 1966. Last production was October 1965, some were sold in 1966 and titled as such, but last model year is 1965.

==PV444==

The PV444 was Volvo&#x27;s first unibody car. Its body structure was influenced by the 1939 Hanomag 1.3 litre, which was purchased and studied by Volvo engineers. It was also the first Volvo in almost 20 years to come with a four-cylinder engine (earlier models had used side-valve straight sixes). The first PV444s were powered by 40 PS 1.4 L inline-four engines designated &quot;B4B&quot;, with three main bearings, overhead valves, and a single downdraft carburettor. The power of this engine increased to in October 1950, and to in October 1955. US models, beginning to appear in early 1956, received an up-rated version called the &quot;B14A&quot;, which was given twin side-draft 1½ in SU carburetors for a total of 70 hp. Most early US sales were limited to Texas and southern California. American customers also had the option of European delivery, in which case they could also get a cheaper model with the basic B4B engine.

By the 1957 model year, engine displacement was increased to 1.6 L and both single downdraft- &quot;B16A&quot; and twin side-draught carburetted &quot;B16B&quot; versions were offered.

==PV544==
In 1958, the PV544 was phased in. Subtle differences with the PV444 included the introduction of a curved one-piece windshield to replace the two panes of flat glass, larger taillights, and a ribbon-type speedometer. The 444&#x27;s three-speed manual transmission was also supplanted by a four-speed unit in the 544. The interior was modified to accommodate five people instead of four by increasing the width of the back seat and using thinner backrests on the front seats. 

The next significant change occurred in 1962, when the B16 was replaced by Volvo&#x27;s new B18 engine, initially developed for the P1800 sports car introduced the previous year. This 1.8 L engine had five main bearings. Again single and twin carburettor versions were offered, designated &quot;B18A&quot; and &quot;B18D&quot;, respectively. The B18A was a slow seller in the US market since the United States&#x27; public prioritised performance over fuel economy. Also in 1962, Volvo changed from 6- to 12-volt electrical systems. In 1963 Volvo began producing the 544 at their new Canadian Dartmouth/Halifax plant, the first Volvo plant to be located outside of Sweden.

The PV544 was also made as an estate (wagon), the Duett, initially designated the &quot;P445&quot; and later the &quot;P210&quot;.

The 544 received incremental mechanical revisions and trim changes until its final production year of 1965. Exactly 440,000 units were built during the 18-year run. The car had so endeared itself to its owners that Volvo ran self-deprecating advertisements in late 1965 and early 1966 imploring PV owners not to be angry with the company.

The Duett&#x27;s utility allowed Volvo to continue the wagon&#x27;s production through the 1969 model year. These were then replaced in some markets by a high-roof version of the Volvo 145, called the &quot;Express&quot;.

<text>Thomas Dempster (23 August 1579 – 6 September 1625) was a Scottish scholar and historian. Born into the aristocracy in Aberdeenshire, which comprises regions of both the Scottish highlands and the Scottish lowlands, he was sent abroad as a youth for his education. The Dempsters were Catholic in an increasingly Protestant country and had a reputation for being quarrelsome. Thomas&#x27; brother James, outlawed for an attack on his father, spent some years as a pirate in the northern islands, escaped by volunteering for military service in the Low Countries and was drawn and quartered there for insubordination. Thomas&#x27; father lost the family fortune in clan feuding and was beheaded for forgery.

For these and political and religious reasons in these often violent Elizabethan times Thomas was unable to come home except for visits. Of uncommon and impressive height and intellectual ability he became an itinerant professor in France and Italy, driven from place to place by a series of colourful personal incidents in which he fought duels or opposed officers of the law. He eventually found refuge and patronage under Grand Duke Cosimo II of Tuscany, who commissioned a work on the Etruscans. Three years later Thomas handed the duke a &quot;magnum opus&quot;, the manuscript of &quot;De Etruria Regali Libri Septem&quot;, &quot;Seven Books about Royal Etruria&quot;, in the Latin language, the first detailed study of every aspect of Etruscan civilisation, considered a brilliant work. In 1723 Thomas Coke finally undertook to publish an enhanced edition of it. The original manuscript remains in Coke&#x27;s library at Holkham.

==Biography==

===Early life===

====Family background and education====
Thomas Dempster, according to his own account, was born at Cliftbog, Aberdeenshire near Turriff). to Thomas Dempster, Laird of Muiresk or Muresk, and Jean Leslie, a daughter of Willam Lesley, 9th Baron of Balquhain, Auchterless and Killesmont, and sheriff (until 1586) of Banff and Buchan. A 1592 charter from James VI confirms the lands owned by Thomas Dempter and his wife Jean Leslie and designates his heirs Robert (2nd son), Thomas (3rd son), and George, who are called &quot;legitimate offspring&quot;, with John, Archibald and Charles Dempster. Girls could not inherit, so they are not listed. The oldest son, James, is not included from this record.

By birth Jean Leslie was connected to the Clan Forbes, her mother, Janet Forbes, was a daughter of John Forbes, 6th Lord Forbes. Her marriage seems to have taken place a few years before Clan Leslie joined with Clan Gordon in their feud against Clan Forbes. The Leslies were supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots, a Catholic, a history which may or may not be connected with later accusations that Thomas was an intelligencer for James I.

Andrew Ogston was appointed as Thomas Dempster&#x27;s tutor. Dempster wrote that he learned the alphabet from Ogston in a single hour at age three. He may have been older; in any case, Andrew recognised talent in his pupil. He sent him to Grammar School in Aberdeen, and in 1588 at the age of ten (or 14) Thomas left home to enter Pembroke Hall, Cambridge.

====Family feud====
Meanwhile, his father Thomas Dempster of Muresk had taken a mistress, Isabella, from Clan Gordon, which must have been a bitter blow to Jean Leslie. Apparently Isabella charmed not only Thomas but his eldest son James Dempster, who married her. Thomas Dempster disinherited him. James Dempster and a band of Gordons waylaid Thomas and his party on the road between his estates. Thomas was shot several times in the legs and suffered a sword blow to the head, as a result of which James became an outlaw, surviving by banditry in Shetland and Orkney. The younger Thomas&#x27; uncle, John Dempster, an Edinburgh lawyer, insisted he be educated abroad to remove him from the environment.

The elder Dempster continued to make decisions that were the ruin of the family. Clan feuding was an expensive activity from which every clan suffered. The elder Thomas had already lost much of his estate to pay for feuds with Clan Currer and Clan Grant. He decided now to sell the estate at Muiresk to the Earl of Erroll to prevent his eldest son from ever inheriting it. The earl took advantage of some fine print in the law, now obscure, to evade payment.

===Education abroad===

====Scots College of Paris====
Thomas and tutor started out for Paris. He was ten in the most precocious dating scheme, possibly as old as 14 in others. They had no sooner reached the continent when they were robbed of all their possessions and probably beaten as well, as Ogston died not long after. Their assailants remain unknown except that they were French soldiers. However, a good Samaritan stepped forward: Walter Brus, an officer in the French army, who was of Scottish descent, and judging from the name, perhaps not of the humblest birth. Walter sent him on to Paris, where other officers of Scottish descent in the French army took up a subscription to place him at the University of Paris.

According to the structure of the university at the time, Thomas would have entered the Scots College there; the fact that the subscription was of Scottish officers indicates that that is the most likely possibility. If true, it shows that Brus&#x27; motivations were not entirely altruistic. The Scots Colleges abroad were being used as training and staging areas for Scottish priests intended to enter Scotland in the wake of the invading army and play the most significant role in its reconversion. The failure of the invasion left them in place (without much work to do other than intelligence and conspiracy).

====Diversions to Belgium and Rome====
At the University of Paris Thomas became deathly ill with &quot;the plague&quot; and on recovering was sent by someone in charge of his destiny to the University of Louvain in the Southern Netherlands (now Belgium), to study under Justus Lipsius. Thomas himself gives that as a reason, but otherwise does not have a clear explanation for the change, stating only that Belgium was a &quot;safe refuge&quot;. Instead he was diverted from this plan by William Crichton, Jesuit, then Superior of the Scots College, Douai, which is a good indication that forces unknown to young Thomas were at work in his life. He did not matriculate at Louvain.

The University of Douai was founded by Philip II of Spain as part of his military build-up against England and was at first identical to the English College there. This college was a refuge and rallying point for English Catholics fleeing the re-establishment of Protestantism after the death of Mary I and the accession of Elizabeth I. Mary had won for herself the popular title &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; for her methods in attempting to reimpose Catholicism on England. Philip II, who had been married to Mary 1554–1558, used the seminarians from Douai openly as agents. They were often in England illegally to establish contacts and maintain a bridgehead, so to speak, for reconversion.

The mastermind in the strategy to reconquer Great Britain for Catholicism and Spain was that of Philip II. He was supported in this effort by a long series of short-term popes (some very short-term), such as Innocent IX (1591), Gregory XIV (1590–1591), etc., who basically followed his strategy. Clement VIII (1592–1605), Cardinal Aldobrandini since 1585, changed the policy and stood against Philip, after his military defeat by the English.

In the latter part of the 16th century, deeming that the reconversion structure needed strengthening, the popes established a number of Scots Colleges, typically through the Jesuits. One of these was the Scots College at Douai, founded by its first Superior, Father William Crighton (P. Gulielmus Creighton), who held the office 1581–1597, according to the records of the college.

Apparently Crighton had been asked by &quot;the pope&quot;: perhaps Pope Sixtus V (1585–1590) to provide Scottish students for seminary study at Rome. The Scots College at Rome did not receive its foundation bull from Clement VIII until 1600, but the request specifically for Scotsmen evidences an early interest in that direction. How Crighton got Dempster&#x27;s name remains as unknown as why he was deported from Paris, but Thomas was one of four selected and did not enroll at Louvain, but journeyed straight to Rome. He mentions that Cardinal Aldobrandini was raising an army there and calls him also Clement VIII, perhaps in anticipation of later events. Dempster says that he was in a &quot;seminarium Romanum&quot; with &quot;the choicest nobility of Italy&quot;, which he would not have been if the Scots College had existed then.

====Scots College of Douai====
The Roman plan came to nothing when, as Dempster says, &quot;the lethal disease recurred.&quot; Acting on medical advice the church authorities returned him to Belgium for a change of climate. After an arduous and dangerous journey north of the Alps he connected at Tournai with James Cheyne, a member of his network of Scottish patrons. Securing funding from &quot;the king of Spain&quot;, who must have been Philip II, and &quot;Archduke Albert&quot;, Cheyne sent him to the Scottish College, Douai, from which, after a few years, he graduated.

The name of Thomas Demster appears as Item Number 64 in the Register of Alumni for the college, applying to the year 1593, with a very brief entry next to his name, &quot;etiam seminarii alumnus.&quot; Apparently the college accepted both seminarians and seculars, and this notification identified Thomas as a seminarian. If the 1579 birthdate is true, Thomas would have been 14. Of his stay there he had little to say, only that he took first prize in poetry and second in philosophy.
He showed such ability that, when still in his teens, he became lecturer on the Humanities at the University of Douai. After a short stay, he returned to Paris, to take his degree of doctor of Canon law.

===Itinerant professor===

Dempster&#x27;s first position as a doctor was a regent, or full professor, of the Collège de Navarre, at age 17. He soon left Paris for Toulouse, which in turn he was forced to leave by the hostility of the city authorities, aroused by his violent assertion of university rights. He was than elected professor of eloquence at the academy of Nîmes. A murderous attack upon him by one of the defeated candidates and his supporters was followed by a libel case, which, though he ultimately won, forced him to leave the town.

A short stay in Spain, as tutor to the son of Marshal de Saint Luc, was terminated by another quarrel; and Dempster returned to Scotland in 1608 with the intention of claiming his father&#x27;s estates. Finding his relatives unsympathetic, and falling into heated controversy with the Presbyterian clergy, he returned to Paris in 1609, where he remained for seven years, becoming professor in several colleges.

In the end, his temporary connection with the Collège de Beauvais was ended by a fight, in which he defeated officers of the king&#x27;s guard, forcing him once again to change his place of residence. The story is told in Latin by Gian Vittorio Rossi, a contemporary. He begins with a characterisation of Dempster that has been much repeated: &quot;But, I don&#x27;t know by what pact, those most mild-mannered sisters (the Muses) ... have embraced Thomas Dempster, a Scot, a man made for war and contention ... he allowed almost no day to go by empty of strife ... but that he should fight another by sword, or, if he had no sword, with fists ...&quot; In the story, Dempster whips a student on the bare back for dueling, but the student, unable to bear the insult, brings in three relatives who happen to belong to the &quot;custodes corporis Regis&quot;, the king&#x27;s own bodyguard. In response Dempster arms the other students, surrounds the guardsmen and puts them in chains in the bell tower. In the resulting inquiry, &quot;such a storm arose&quot; that Thomas departed for England. The story says distinctly that England was a &quot;safe refuge&quot;, meaning between the lines that Catholic prosecutors could not extradite him or threaten him with agents.

The story goes on to say that in England he met a woman (Susanna Valeria) &quot;so abundant, so favored by Venus that nothing else would do but that he have her to wife.&quot; At this point the story skips over a small matter, intentionally or not, that might well explain Thomas&#x27; future apparent inability to settle in one place, even as a renowned and successful scholar. The dedication of his edition of Rosinus&#x27; &quot;Antiquitatum romanarum corpus absolutissimum&quot; to King James I, a Protestant (the king of the King James Bible), even though he, Dempster, was a Catholic, had won him an invitation to the English court; and in 1615 he went to London. There James I appointed him historiographer royal.

===&quot;Escape&quot; to Italy===
He was not there long. Even though England was totally safe for him, and he had already been preferred by a king who admired him, and had married an English girl, complaining that he was not accepted by the Protestants and could not find advancement because of them he set sail for Rome with his wife. Pope Paul V immediately drew what may have been the correct conclusion and threw him into prison as a spy. However, the good pope changed his mind shortly, perhaps still hoping to reconvert the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and decided accept the matter graciously, placing Thomas in Italy. He used his influence with Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, to get Thomas appointed to the professorship of the &quot;Pandects&quot; at Pisa. The Grand Duke commissioned him also to write a definitive work on the Etruscans.

In 1619 his daughter died shortly after birth, the only child he was to have. In 1620 after the execution of his father he began to call himself the Baron of Muiresk, which in Scotland was considered an illegitimate claim. His brother James, though disinherited from the estate, still had a claim to the title, which was considered to end with his death, as he had no heir. In any case Thomas was not the second son but the third. The second (Robert) had no heirs, either, which did not strengthen the case of the Dempsters. They were forced to accept the end of their clan; that is, there were no further charters to Dempsters from the king, nor was anyone entitled to be called Baron Dempster or use the coat of arms. Modern Dempsters, of course, may do as they please in accordance with the laws of the countries in which they reside.

At Pisa Thomas worked very hard on his commission, sometimes 14 hours per day. The strain was too much for his wife, perhaps depressed also by her loss. She ran off with an Englishman, but later returned. The issue of adultery came up again. Violent accusations followed, indignantly repudiated; a diplomatic correspondence ensued, and a demand was made, and supported by the grand duke, for an apology, which the professor refused to make, preferring to lose his chair. He set out once more for Scotland, but was intercepted by the Florentine cardinal Luigi Capponi, who persuaded him to remain at Bologna as professor of Humanity. This was the most distinguished post in the most famous of continental universities, and Dempster was at the height of his fame. Though his &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot; and &quot;Scotia ilustrior&quot; had been placed on the &quot;Index&quot; pending correction, Pope Urban VIII made him a knight and gave him a pension.

It was in Bologna that Thomas made friends with Matteo Pellegrini, who was to complete his autobiography posthumously and described &quot;Dempsterus&quot; as a man &quot;outstanding in body and mind: his height was above the average height of the common man: his hair was nearly black and the colour of his skin not far from that: his head was huge and the carriage of his body completely regal; his strength and ferocity were as outstanding as that of a soldier ...&quot;

===End===
Thomas was not to enjoy his honours long. His wife ran off again, this time with a student. He pursued them as far as Vicenza. Becoming ill with a fever he returned to Bologna, where he died on 6 September at age 46 (or 50).

His associates in the Accademia della Notte gave him a splendid funeral, attended by the papal legate, and one of the academicians, Ovidio Montalbani, delivered an elaborate funeral eulogy, which was published in the course of the following year.

Thomas Dempster is buried in Bologna

==Publications==
Dempster was equally at home in philology, criticism, law, biography, and history. He was a master of the Latin language and wrote in Latin, as was still the academic custom of the times. His works are:

*An edition of Rosinus&#x27; &quot;Antiquitatum Romanarum corpus absolutissimum&quot; &quot;The Most Complete Body of Roman Antiquities&quot; (Paris, 1613). Dedicated to James I. This is the work that came to the attention of the king.
*&quot;Panegyricus Jacobo M.&quot; (Magnae) &quot;Britanniae Regi&quot;, &quot;Panegyric to James, King of Great Britain (London, 1616)&quot;
*Poetic contributions &quot;In Obitum Aldinae Catellae: lachrymae poeticae&quot;, &quot;On the Death of the Puppy Aldina: Poetic tears&quot; (Paris, 1622).
*An edition of Benedetto Accolti&#x27;s &quot;De bello a Christianis contra barbaros&quot;, &quot;Of the Christian War against the Barbarians&quot; (1623).
*&quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Scotorum&quot;, &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the Scottish Nation&quot; (Bologna, 1627). Morér asserts that this &quot;is one of the most discredited works ever written in the field of Scottish history.&quot; The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica says: &quot;In this he tries to prove that Bernard (Sapiens), Alcuin, Saint Boniface and Johannes Scotus Eriugena were all Scots, and even Boadicea becomes a Scottish author.&quot; The last chapter was intended as his autobiography, which Matteo Pellegrini, a friend at Bologna, completed posthumously. Much of what it says about him; for example, that his mother had 29 children and that he himself was one of triplets, is counted as prevarication. The low quality of this work after so much brilliance remains unexplained.
*Some of his Latin verse is printed in the first volume (pp. 306–354) of &quot;Delitiae poetarum Scotorum&quot; (Amsterdam, 1637).

==The rescue of &quot;De Etruria Regali&quot;==
Dempster&#x27;s major work was rescued from oblivion by Thomas Coke (1697–1759) later Earl of Leicester. Aged 15, he started on the Grand Tour, and in Etruria befriended the Grand Duke Cosimo II. Through him he discovered the existence of Dempster&#x27;s manuscript, which he purchased from its then owner, Antonio Maria Salvini. This he published apparently at his own expense; however, the publication was not exactly of the original. Filippo Buonarroti of Florence emended the text and added a critical apparatus. The duke had his own engravers enhance Dempster&#x27;s illustrations with new ones drawn from artefacts in various collections. In all the work came to contain about 100 copperplate engravings. It came out in two volumes, folio, at Florence, 1723–1724, under the comprehensive title:
:&quot;Thomae Dempsteri a Muresk Scoti Pandectarum in Pisano Lyceo Professoris Ordinarii de Etruria Regali libri septem, opus posthumum, in duas partes divisum, nunc primum editi curante Tho. Coke&quot;

A Latin dedication to Cosimo III, dated 1725, London, was added in 1726 by Coke. A folio supplement was published by Passeri, 1767. The publication of the book sparked the first public wave of interest in the Etruscans throughout academic Italy.

<text>Benedetto Accolti (1415 in Arezzo26 September 1464 in Florence) was an Italian jurist, humanist and historian.
He was born at Arezzo in Tuscany, of a prominent family, several members of which were distinguished like himself for their attainments in law. He was for some time professor of law in the University of Florence, and after the dismissal in 1456 from the Florentine chancellorship of the renowned humanist Poggio Bracciolini for incompetence and an interregnum of two years, Accolti himself became Chancellor of the Florentine Republic in 1458.

Accolti&#x27;s memory was prodigious. Having, one day, heard a speech delivered by an ambassador from the king of Hungary to the Florentine government, he afterwards repeated it, word for word.

Accolti wrote in Latin a history of the First Crusade, entitled &quot;De Bello a Christianis contra Barbaros gesto pro Christi Sepulchro et Judaea recuperandis libri IV&quot; (1464), or &quot;On the War carried on by the Christians against the Barbarians, for the Recovery of Christ&#x27;s Sepulchre, and of Judea&quot;, which is said to have furnished Torquato Tasso with the historical basis for his &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;. Another work of Accolti&#x27;s, a &quot;Dialogue&quot; (1461–63), was published at Parma in 1689; in this work, the author compares the achievements of the moderns to the ancients, in order to prove that the former are in no respect inferior to the latter. Both works were dedicated to members of the Medici family, the &quot;Dialogue&quot; to Cosimo &quot;il vecchio&quot;, the history to his son Piero.

Accolti&#x27;s younger brother Francesco was also a distinguished jurist. His son Pietro became a cardinal, while another son Bernardo was a notable vernacular poet. Benedetto Accolti the Younger, the chancellor&#x27;s grandson, also became a cardinal.

<text>Bernardo Accolti (September 11, 1465March 1, 1536) was an Italian poet.

He was born at Arezzo, the son of Benedetto Accolti.

Known in his own day as &quot;l&#x27;Unico Aretino&quot;, he acquired great fame as a reciter of impromptu verse. He was listened to by large crowds, composed of the most learned men and the most distinguished prelates of the age. Among others, Cardinal Pietro Bembo left on record a testimony to his extraordinary talent. He was so highly regarded and received such lavish remuneration by Pope Leo X that he was able to buy the Duchy of Nepi.

It is probable that he succeeded better in his extemporaneous productions than in those which were the fruit of deliberation. His works, under the title &quot;Virginia&quot;, &quot;Comedia&quot;, &quot;Capitoli e Strambotti di Messer Bernardo Accolti Aretino&quot;, were published at Florence in 1513, and have been reprinted several times.

<doc id="334725" wikidata="Q1752703" url="?curid=334725" title="Problem of Hell">
<text>The problem of Hell is an ethical problem in the Abrahamic religions of Christianity and Islam, in which the existence of Hell or Jahannam for the punishment of souls in the afterlife is regarded as inconsistent with the notion of a just, moral, and omnipotent, omnibenevolent, omniscient supreme being. Also regarded as inconsistent with such a just being is the combination of human free will—on which the justification for eternal damnation for sinners is predicated—and the divine qualities of omniscience (being all-knowing) and omnipotence (being all-powerful), as this would mean God (not humans) would determine everything that has happened and will happen in the universe—including sinful human behavior. 

C. P. Ragland of Saint Louis University writes in the &quot;Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; that the problem of hell is &quot;a version of&quot; the problem of evil. He defines the problem of hell: &quot;If there is an omniperfect God—one that necessarily has the perfection of Goodness—then no one will be damned.&quot;

The problem of hell derives from four key propositions: Hell exists; it is for the punishment of people whose lives on Earth are judged to have been sinful; some people go there; and there is no escape.

==Issues and criticisms==
There are several major issues within the problem of Hell.
* The definition of Hell.
* Whether the existence of Hell is compatible with the existence of a just God.
* Whether Hell is compatible with God&#x27;s mercy, especially as articulated in Christianity.
* Whether Hell is compatible with the concept of an all-loving God.
* Whether any sin or combination of sins could warrant never-ending punishment or eternal torture.
* Whether free will is compatible with God&#x27;s omnipotence and omniscience.

Traditionally Hell is defined in Christianity and Islam as one of two abodes of Afterlife for human beings (the other being Heaven or Jannah), and the one where sinners suffer torment eternally. There are several words in the original languages of the Bible that are translated into the word &#x27;Hell&#x27; in English. There are also a number of names in the Quran that translate as hell, perhaps the most common one being &quot;Jahannam&quot;. In at least some versions of Christianity there is a question of whether or not Hell is actually populated forever. If it is not, one must suppose that those populating Hell may eventually die, or that God will ultimately restore all immortal souls in the World to Come, i.e. Heaven, which would at least lessen the issue of divine injustice and deal with one of the key propositions of there being &quot;no escape&quot;. This is known as the universal reconciliation doctrine. In Islam it is commonly thought that Muslim sinners will not spend eternity in Hell but spend time there to be purified of their sins before being allowed into Heaven.

The question of compatibility of free will on the one hand, and God&#x27;s omnipotence and omniscience on the other, can be framed as:
An early Islamic school of thought known as Muʿtazila could not accept the orthodoxy of determinism since it meant that a person &quot;could be punished for acts which God himself had commanded him to perform&quot;. Muʿtazila were then accused of the heresy of &quot;dualism&quot; because they gave human beings &#x27;power&#x27; over their actions (free will), which made them the &#x27;creator&#x27; of their works, and &quot;thus encroached on the almighty power of God, for there would be two creators of actions&quot;.

In some respects, the problem of Hell is similar to the problem of evil, with the suffering in Hell equivalent to the suffering of victims of evil in the temporal world. Framed this way, the suffering of Hell is caused by free will and something God could not have prevented; or worse still is caused by the lack of free will, as God&#x27;s omniscience—His knowing/determining all that will ever happen in His creation, including human acts of good and evil—makes free will impossible and souls predestined, but God still decrees punishment in hell. The problem of Hell could be viewed as the worst and most intractable instance of the problem of evil.

If one believes in the idea of eternal Hell, unending suffering, or the idea that some souls will perish (whether destroyed by God or otherwise), author Thomas Talbott says that one has to either let go of the idea that God wishes to save all beings (suggesting that God is not omnibenevolent), or accept the idea that God wants to save all, but will not &quot;successfully accomplish his will and satisfy his own desire in this matter&quot; (suggesting that He is not omnipotent and omniscient).

==Judaism==

Judaism teaches that the soul continues to exist after death, and that it is subject to both reward and punishment after death. However, this punishment is held to be temporary, normally only lasting up to 12 months after death. After this period, the soul is able to enjoy the light of God in the afterlife. Because the punishment is temporary, the problem of Hell in the Christian sense is less applicable to Judaism. Both non-Jews and Jews have a share in the World to Come, if they are righteous.

==Christianity==

In Christianity, Hell has traditionally been regarded as a place or state of punishment for wrongdoing or sin in the mortal life, as a manifestation of divine justice. Nonetheless, the extreme severity and/or infinite duration of the punishment might be seen as incompatible with justice. However, Hell is not seen as strictly a matter of retributive justice even by the more traditionalist churches. For example, the Eastern Orthodox see it as a condition brought about by, and the natural consequence of, free rejection of God&#x27;s love.

In some ancient Eastern Christian traditions, (such as 7th century Syriac Christianity), Hell and Heaven are distinguished not spatially, but by the relation of a deceased person to God&#x27;s love.

In terms of the Bible itself, issues of salvation and access to heaven or to hell are mentioned frequently. Examples include John 3:16
&quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; which tends to show the wicked perish and the saints have everlasting life or (NIV), &quot;Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God&#x27;s wrath remains on them&quot;, and (NIV), &quot;Those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus, they will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might.&quot;

The minority Christian doctrine that sinners perish and are destroyed rather than punished eternally such as is found in John 3:16 &quot;That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.&quot;, is referred to as Christian mortalism; annihilation for those not awarded immortal life, conditional immortality for those who are. This Christian view is found in very early Christianity, resurfaced in the Reformation, and since 1800 has found increasing support among Protestant theologians.

===Justice===
Some opponents of the traditional doctrine of Hell claim that the punishment is disproportionate to any crimes that could be committed. Because human beings have a finite lifespan, they can commit only a finite number of sins, yet Hell is an infinite punishment. In this vein, Jorge Luis Borges suggests in his essay &quot;La duración del Infierno&quot; that no transgression can warrant an infinite punishment on the grounds that there is no such thing as an &quot;infinite transgression&quot;. Philosopher Immanuel Kant argued in 1793 in &quot;Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason&quot; that since morality lies ultimately in a person&#x27;s disposition, and as disposition is concerned with the adoption of universal principles, or as he called them: &quot;maxims&quot;, every human being is guilty of, in one sense, an infinite amount of violations of the law, and he consequently an infinite punishment is not unjustified.

===Divine mercy===
Another issue is the problem of harmonizing the existence of Hell with God&#x27;s infinite mercy or omnibenevolence which is found in scripture.

Some modern critics of the doctrine of Hell (such as Marilyn McCord Adams) claim that, even if Hell is seen as a choice rather than as punishment, it would be unreasonable for God to give such flawed and ignorant creatures as ourselves the responsibility of our eternal destinies. Jonathan Kvanvig, in &quot;The Problem of Hell&quot; (1993), agrees that God would not allow one to be eternally damned by a decision made under the wrong circumstances. One should not always honor the choices of human beings, even when they are full adults, if, for instance, the choice is made while depressed or careless. On Kvanvig&#x27;s view, God will abandon no person until they have made a settled, final decision, under favorable circumstances, to reject God, but God will respect a choice made under the right circumstances. Once a person finally and competently chooses to reject God, out of respect for the person&#x27;s autonomy, God allows them to be annihilated.

===Catholicism===
====Official teaching====
The Catholic Church does not believe in the problem of hell, but believes - as dogma - that because God is all-good he condemns the impenitent to eternal punishment in hell at death and at the Last Judgment. This dogma was defined by the Council of Trent based on Jesus&#x27; teaching of the same during his public ministry and when &quot;he descended into hell.&quot;

The church also teaches that hell is a place of punishment brought about by a person&#x27;s self-exclusion from communion with God. Hell is the free and continual rejection of God&#x27;s forgiveness of sins. This rejection takes the form of the committing of a mortal sin without repentance. (This does not include original sin, since it is not an evil deed, since no one is predestined to hell, and since Feeneyism is the heresy that non-Catholics and excommunicated Catholics cannot be saved) A sinner, once in hell, will inevitably refuse to turn away from his mortal sin to God&#x27;s forgiveness. Accordingly, hell must endure as chief punishment for this continuing lack of repentance.

====Unofficial teaching====
Some theologians speculate about the reason for the creation and eternity of hell. A common argument made is from divine justice: as the righteous receive an eternal reward (God) for a temporary good deed, so the wicked receive an eternal punishment (loss of God) for a temporary evil deed. Another common argument is that the loss of God includes the loss of one&#x27;s good inclinations and desires, so that all that remains is evil inclinations and desires (whereby the demons and the damned refuse to repent). 

Thomas Aquinas said that not all punishment is remedial or temporary, such as capital punishment, and that hell fits this exception. He further said that, by being confined to hell, the wicked cannot commit sin among the righteous in heaven.

According to Catherine of Siena, Jesus told her of the righteous in heaven: &quot;Their will is so one with mine that even if a father and mother saw their child in hell, or a child its parent, it would not trouble them: They would even be content to see them punished, since they are my enemies.&quot;

==Islam==

In Islam, Jahannam (hell) is the final destiny and place of punishment in Afterlife for those guilty of disbelief and (according to some interpretations) evil doing in their lives on earth.
Hell is regarded as necessary for Allah&#x27;s (God&#x27;s) divine justice and justified by God&#x27;s absolute sovereignty, and an &quot;integral part of Islamic theology&quot;. In addition to the question of whether divine mercy (one of Names of God in Islam is &quot;The Merciful&quot; &quot;ar-Raḥīm&quot;) is compatible with consigning sinners to hell, is whether &quot;predestination&quot; of souls to hell by God is just. One of six articles of faith in Sunni Islam is God&#x27;s control over everything that has happened and will happen in the universe—including sinful human behavior and who will go to Jahannam. This introduces the question, (or at least the paradox), where sinners are said to be punished in Jahannam for their decision to sin of their own free will, but everything that happens in the world is determined by an all powerful and all knowing God.

===The inhabitants of Hell===
Muslims and Islamic scholars disagree over who will be consigned to Jahannam. A common concern is the fate of non-Muslims and if they will be punished for not belonging to the &quot;right&quot; religion. An often-recited Quranic verse implies that righteous non-Muslims will be saved on Judgement Day:
:Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabians—those who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness—will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve. 
However some scholars hold this verse may be set aside as only applying before the arrival of Muhammad,
as there &quot;exists a strong exegetical tradition&quot; that claims that verse and others suggesting non-Muslims may be saved, were abrogated by a later verse indicating a much less pleasant hereafter:
:&quot;... .whoever desires a religion other than Islam, it shall not be accepted from him, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers.&quot; (Q.3:85)
Some non-pluralist scholars like Ibn Arabi state that every human will receive a proper message and will not be doomed for ignorance, while others claim non-Muslims are judged by their own moral standards, because of God&#x27;s all-embracing mercy.

Another criterion to determine the justice of Hell&#x27;s punishment derives from its duration, on which Islamic scholars disagree. The orthodox view holds that Hell is eternal, others hold that Hell exists to purify rather than inflict pain, and may even cease to exist after a while.

With the increasing urgency of pluralism, modern writers such as Edip Yüksel and Mouhanad Khorchide hold Hell to be finite rather than eternal: Yüksel argues that evildoers will be punished in Hell for an appropriate period then cease to exist, so that their suffering (which is described in the Quran and is balanced with descriptions of heaven) will be only a just amount.

===Concerning predestination===
Approximately 87–90% of Muslims are Sunni, and one of six articles of faith in Sunni Islam is belief in the existence of God&#x27;s predestination due to God&#x27;s omniscience, whether it involves good or bad. Based on Sunni traditions, God wrote everything that will happen (in all of his creation) on a &quot;tablet&quot; before creating the world. Thus it is asked: how can humans be punished for what God has determined they do? In this tradition, in Ashari thought, God created good and evil deeds, which humans decide upon—humans have their own possibility to choose, but God retains sovereignty of all possibilities. This still leaves the question of why God set out those people&#x27;s lives (or the negative choice of deeds) which result in Hell, and why God made it possible to become evil. In Islamic thought, evil is considered to be movement away from good, and God created this possibility so that humans are able to recognize good. In contrast, angels are unable to move away from good, therefore angels generally rank lower than humans as they have reached heaven because they lack the ability to perceive the world as humans do.

==Proposed answers==
===Annihilationism===

As with other Jewish writings of the Second Temple period, the New Testament text distinguishes two words, both translated &quot;Hell&quot; in older English Bibles: &quot;Hades&quot;, &quot;the grave&quot;, and &quot;Gehenna&quot; where God &quot;can destroy both body and soul&quot;. A minority of Christians read this to mean that neither Hades nor Gehenna are eternal but refer to the ultimate destruction of the wicked in the Lake of Fire in a consuming fire, but which because of the Greek words used in translating from the Hebrew text has become confused with Greek myths and ideas. From the sixth century BC onward, the Greeks developed pagan ideas for the dead, and of reincarnation and even transmigration of souls. Christians picked up these pagan beliefs inferred by the Greek of immortality of the soul, or spirit being of a mortal individual, which survives the death of the body of this world and this lifetime, which is at odds and in contrast to the scriptural teaching that the dead go to the grave and know nothing and then at the end, an eternal oblivion of the wicked and an eternal life for the saints. Scripture makes clear that the dead are awaiting resurrection at the last judgment, when Christ comes and also when each person will receive his reward or are part of those lost with the wicked.

The Greek words used for those Bibles written in Greek, came loaded with ideas not in line with the original Hebrew, but since at the time, Greek was used as basically English is used today to communicate between people across the world, it was translated into these Greek words, and giving an incorrect understanding of the penalty of sin. In the Hebrew text when people died they went to Sheol, the grave and the wicked ultimately went to Gehenna which is the consuming by fire. So when the grave or the eternal oblivion of the wicked was translated into Greek, the word Hades was sometimes used, which is a Greek term for the realm of the dead. Nevertheless, the meaning depending on context was the grave, death, or the end of the wicked in which they are ultimately destroyed or perish. So we see where the grave or death or eventual destruction of the wicked, was translated using Greek words that since they had no exact ones to use, became a mix of mistranslation, pagan influence, and Greek myth associated with the word, but its original meaning was simple death or the destruction of the wicked at the end.

Christian mortalism is the doctrine that all men and women, including Christians, must die, and do not continue and are not conscious after death. Therefore, annihilationism includes the doctrine that &quot;the wicked&quot; are also destroyed rather than tormented forever in traditional &quot;Hell&quot; or the lake of fire. Christian mortalism and annihilationism are directly related to the doctrine of conditional immortality, the idea that a human soul is not immortal unless it is given eternal life at the Second Coming of Christ and the resurrection of the dead. Such a belief is based on the many texts which state that the wicked perish:
:&quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; (KJV).
:&quot;For the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.&quot; (KJV).

Annihilationism asserts that God will eventually destroy or annihilate the wicked when they are consumed in the Lake of Fire at the end, leaving only the righteous to live on in immortality.
Conditional immortality asserts that souls are naturally mortal, and those who reject Christ are separated from the sustaining power of God, thus dying off on their own.

This is seen in the texts making clear the alternatives at the end are to perish or to have eternal, everlasting life:
:&quot;For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot; (KJV)

And that the consequence for sin at the day of judgment when God will judge both the living and the dead when He appears is death, not burning forever. God&#x27;s gift is eternal life, very different from the penalty of sin:
:&quot;The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished.&quot; . (KJV).
:&quot;As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.&quot; (KJV).
:&quot;So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.&quot; (KJV).

The mortality of the soul has been held throughout the history of both Judaism and Christianity, with many biblical scholars looking at the issue through the Hebrew text, have denied the teaching of innate immortality. Rejection of the immortality of the soul, and advocacy of Christian mortalism, was a feature of Protestantism since the early days of the Reformation with Martin Luther himself rejecting the traditional idea, though his view did not carry into orthodox Lutheranism. One of the most notable English opponents of the immortality of the soul was Thomas Hobbes who describes the idea as a Greek &quot;contagion&quot; in Christian doctrine. Modern proponents of conditional immortality include as denominations the Seventh-day Adventists, Bible Students, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Christadelphians, and some other Protestant Christians.

===Free will===
Some apologists argue that Hell exists because of free will, and that Hell is a choice rather than an imposed punishment. Jonathan L. Kvanvig writes:

Similarly, Dave Hunt (1996) writes:

Popular culture, for instance, the graphic novel series &quot;The Sandman&quot;, sometimes proposes the idea that souls go to Hell because they &quot;believe&quot; that they deserve to, rather than being condemned to it by God or Satan.

===Universal reconciliation===
Universal reconciliation is the doctrine or belief of some Christians that all will eventually receive salvation because of the love and mercy of God. Universal reconciliation does not commit one to the position that one can be saved apart from Christ. It only commits one to the position that all will eventually be saved through Christ. Neither does universal reconciliation commit one to the position that there is no Hell or damnation—Hell can well be the consuming fire through which Christ refines those who turn from him (Matthew 3:11). Universal reconciliation only claims that one day Death and Hades themselves will be destroyed and all immortal souls will be reconciled to Him.

It was traditionally claimed by some western scholars such as the Universalist historian George T. Knight (1911) and Pierre Batiffol (English translation 1914) that a form of universal salvation could be found among some theologians in early Christianity. Origen interpreted the New Testament&#x27;s reference (Acts 3:21) to a &quot;restoration of all things&quot;, (Greek: apocatastasis of all things), as meaning that sinners &quot;might&quot; be restored to God and released from Hell, returning the universe to a state identical to its pure beginnings. This theory of apocatastasis could be easily interpreted to imply that even devils would be saved, as was the case during the later Origenist controversies. Some Greek Orthodox scholars do not count Gregory of Nyssa (AD 331–395) as a believer in Universal Salvation, although many do, given that multiple passages in his writings appear to explicitly affirm apocatastasis.

In the 17th century, a belief in Christian universalism appeared in England and traveled over to what has become the present-day US Christian Universalists such as Hosea Ballou argued that Jesus taught Universalist principles including universal reconciliation and the divine origin and destiny of all souls. Ballou also argued that some Universalist principles were taught or foreshadowed in the Old Testament. Critics of universalism maintain that the Bible does not teach universal salvation, while proponents insist that it does.

Recent examples of advocates for the position are Kallistos Ware, a Greek Orthodox bishop and retired University of Oxford theologian who states that many of the &#x27;Fathers of Church&#x27; postulated the idea of salvation for all, and Saint Silouan of Mount Athos, who argued that the compassion and love of those in heaven and on earth will extend to eliminating suffering even in hell. In terms of Biblical citations, Father David A. Fisher, Pastor of St. Anthony of Padua
Maronite Church and professor of philosophy at Ohio Central State University, has argued that total reconciliation seems to arise from the First Epistle to the Corinthians such as , &quot;As all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ&quot;, and , &quot;God will be all in all.&quot; Verses that seem to contradict the tradition of complete damnation and come up in arguments also include (NIV), &quot;For no one is cast off by the Lord forever. Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love, For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to anyone.&quot;, (NIV), &quot;We have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe.&quot;, and , &quot;And all people will see God’s salvation.&quot;

=== Theodicy ===
With regards to the problem of hell, as one that can be traced to the more fundamental theological dilemma of God and the existence of good and evil, theodicy offers its own answers. The main issue holds that if God is all good, powerful, and perfect, then how can he allow evil and, by extension, hell to exist? For some thinkers, the existence of evil and hell could mean that God is not perfectly good and powerful or that there is no God at all. Theodicy tries to address this dilemma by reconciling an all-knowing, all-powerful, and omnibenevolent God with the existence of evil and suffering, outlining the possibility that God and evil can coexist. There are several thoughts or theodicies such as biblical theodicy, the theodicy attributed to Gottfried Leibniz, Plotinian, Irenean, and Augustinian, among others. These differ in their respective arguments but, overall, these theodicies—as opposed to a defense that demonstrates the existence of God and evil or hell—seek to demonstrate a framework where God&#x27;s existence is plausible. It is, therefore, a logical instead of evidential answer to the problem. A theodicy explains God&#x27;s reason for allowing evil, that there is a greater good that justifies such permission.

==Empty Hell theory==
Some Roman Catholic theologians prominent around the time of the Second Vatican Council, such as Karl Rahner, Gisbert Greshake, and Cardinal Hans Urs von Balthasar have at length discussed the possibility that any man may be led by a final grace to freely willed repentance if necessary at least at some point in the process of dying. This possible process is described thus by the late Munich dogmatic Prof. Michael Schmaus:
If in terms of theology death is a meeting of a man with God in so far as God calls man and he answers obedience, readiness and love, it would be surprising if in the moment of dying the chances of taking position never were given, even contrary to the outward look. ... One cannot apply to experience as counter-argument, because ... what happens then in the interior and behind the physiological processes is only known by someone who experiences dying itself, and this unto its very end. We may assume that in the dissolving process of the earthly union of body and soul and with the progressing breakaway from earthly entanglements, a special awakeness accrues to man ... in which he can say yea or nay to God.

Balthasar was careful to describe his opinion that Hell might be empty as merely a hope, but even this claim was rejected by most conservative Catholics, including Cardinal Avery Dulles. The Syllabus says in no. 17 that we may not (even) hope for the salvation of all non-Catholics; this seems to mean conversely that there is at least one non-Catholic in all history who will not be saved. seems to say that &quot;many&quot; will be reproved, which may imply hell (not some lesser purgatory). On the other hand, error no. 17 in question only speaks of those &quot;in the true Church of Christ&quot;, which need not imply the visible Church. Roman Catholicism not only allows for the possibility that non-Catholics can be saved, and even rejected the view known as Feeneyism, which held that only people in visible communion with the Catholic Church could be saved.

<text>Patrick Hamilton (1504 – 29 February 1528) was a Scottish Roman Catholic priest and an early Protestant Reformer in Scotland. He travelled to Europe, where he met several of the leading reformed thinkers, before returning to Scotland to preach the doctrines of Lutheranism. Hamilton began preaching in Scotland in 1527 and was invited as a friend by Archbishop James Beaton to a conference in St. Andrews. Instead, he was tried for heresy by an Ecclesiastical tribunal led by Archbishop Beaton. He was found guilty, handed over to the secular executioner, and burnt at the stake in St Andrews. 

Hamilton&#x27;s judges considered themselves to be defending the Catholic Church in Scotland and enforcing the traditional principle of Canon law that &quot;error has no rights&quot;; Hamilton&#x27;s calm demeanor in the face of death won the admiration of those present and his death was widely publicized using the new technologies of the Gutenberg Revolution. Hamilton&#x27;s trial and execution accordingly backfired dramatically, as still often happens during religious persecution of any kind. After Hamilton&#x27;s death, others who had Lutheran New Testaments or who professed Protestant doctrines were also burned or sentenced to severe punishments, while others fled the country. Since the Scottish Reformation Parliament of 1560, the site of Hamilton&#x27;s execution has been treated with enormous respect, even by the students and faculty of the University of St Andrews.

==Early life==
Hamilton was the second son of Sir Patrick Hamilton of Kincavil and Catherine Stewart, daughter of Alexander, Duke of Albany, second son of James II of Scotland. He was born in the diocese of Glasgow, probably at his father&#x27;s estate of Stanehouse in Lanarkshire, and was most likely educated at Linlithgow. In 1517 he was appointed titular Abbot of Fearn Abbey, Ross-shire. The income from this position paid for him to study at the University of Paris, where he became a Master of the Arts in 1520. It was in Paris, where Martin Luther&#x27;s writings were already exciting much discussion, that he first learnt the doctrines he would later uphold. According to sixteenth century theologian Alexander Ales, Hamilton subsequently went to Leuven, attracted probably by the fame of Erasmus, who in 1521 had his headquarters there.

==Return and flight==
Returning to Scotland, Hamilton selected St Andrews, the capital of the Catholic Church in Scotland and of education, as his residence. On 9 June 1523 he became a member of St Leonard&#x27;s College, part of the University of St Andrews, and on 3 October 1524 he was admitted to its faculty of arts, where he was first a student of, and then a colleague of the Renaissance humanist and logician John Mair. At the university Hamilton attained such influence that he was permitted, as precentor, to conduct a Solemn High Mass based on music of his own composition at the St. Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral.

The reforming doctrines, however, 
had obtained a firm hold on the young abbot, and he was eager to communicate them to his fellow-countrymen.
Early in 1527 the attention of James Beaton, Archbishop of St Andrews, was directed to the heretical preaching of the young priest, whereupon he ordered that Hamilton should be formally tried. Hamilton fled to Germany, enrolling himself as a student, under Franz Lambert of Avignon, in the new University of Marburg, opened on 30 May 1527 by Philip of Hesse. Among those he met there were Hermann von dem Busche, one of the contributors to the &quot;Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum&quot;, John Frith and William Tyndale.

Late in the autumn of 1527, Fr. Hamilton returned to Scotland, speaking openly of his convictions. He went first to his brother&#x27;s house at Kincavel, near Linlithgow, where he preached frequently, and, soon afterwards, he renounced clerical celibacy and married a young lady of noble rank; her name is unrecorded. David Beaton, the Abbot of Arbroath, avoiding open violence through fear of Hamilton&#x27;s powerful protectors, invited him to a conference at St Andrews. The Young minister, predicting that he was going to &quot;confirm the pious in the true doctrine&quot; by his death, accepted the invitation, and for nearly a month was allowed to preach and to debate.

With the publication of &quot;Patrick&#x27;s Places&quot; in 1528, he introduced into Scottish theology Martin Luther&#x27;s emphasis of the distinction of Law and Gospel.

==Trial and execution==
At length, he was summoned before a council of bishops and clergy presided over by the archbishop. There were thirteen charges, seven based on the doctrines in Philip Melanchthon&#x27;s &quot;Loci Communes&quot;, the first theological exposition of Martin Luther&#x27;s scriptural study and teachings in 1521. On examination Hamilton expressed a belief in their truth and the council sentenced him to death on all thirteen charges. Hamilton was seized and allegedly surrendered to the soldiery based on an assurance that he would be restored to his friends without injury. However, after a debate with Friar Campbell, the council handed him over to the secular power to be burned at the stake outside the front entrance to St Salvator&#x27;s Chapel in St Andrews. The sentence was carried out on the same day to avoid rescue by his uncle and preclude any attempted rescue by friends. He burned from noon to 6 p.m. and his last words were &quot;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit&quot;. The spot is today marked with a monogram of his initials (PH) set into the cobblestones of the pavement of North Street, which students avoid stepping on to this day out of respect and to prevent poor marks on their exams.

==Legacy==
Hamilton&#x27;s execution attracted more interest than ever before to Lutheranism and greatly contributed to the Reformation in Scotland. It was said that the &quot;reek of Master Patrick Hamilton infected as many as it blew upon&quot;. Hamilton&#x27;s fortitude during his execution persuaded Alexander Ales, who had been appointed to convince Hamilton of his errors, to enter into the Lutheran Church. His martyrdom is unusual in that he was almost alone in Scotland during the Lutheran stage of the Reformation. His only known writings, based upon &quot;Loci communes&quot; and known as &quot;Patrick&#x27;s Places&quot;, echoed the doctrine of justification by faith and the contrast between the gospel and the law in a series of clear-cut propositions.&#x27;&quot;Patrickes Places&quot;&#x27; was not Hamilton&#x27;s own title, but was given in the translation into English by John Fryth in 1564, and are presented in Book 8 of the 1570 edition of John Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Acts and Monuments&quot;.&quot;&quot;.

Students at the University of St Andrews traditionally avoid stepping on the monogram of Hamilton&#x27;s initials outside St Salvator&#x27;s Chapel for fear of being cursed and failing their final exams. To lift the curse students may participate in the annual May dip where they traditionally run into the North Sea at 05.00 to wash away their sins and bad luck.

A school in Auckland, New Zealand called &#x27;Saint Kentigern College&#x27; has a house named after Patrick Hamilton

==Katherine Hamilton==
Patrick&#x27;s sister, Katherine Hamilton, was the wife of the Captain of Dunbar Castle and also a committed Protestant. In March 1539 she was forced in exile to Berwick upon Tweed for her beliefs. She had been in England before and met the Queen, Jane Seymour.

According to the historian John Spottiswood, Katherine was brought to trial for heresy before James V at Holyroodhouse in 1534, and her other brother James Hamilton of Livingston fled. The King was impressed by her conviction shown in her short answer to the prosecutor. He laughed and spoke to her privately, convincing her to abandon her profession of faith. The other accused also recanted for the time.

A play about Katherine, with Patrick as a secondary character, was written by Rona Munro, and performed on tour in 2024.

<doc id="334730" wikidata="Q4539002" url="?curid=334730" title="Alfred Yarrow">
<text>Sir Alfred Fernandez Yarrow, 1st Baronet, (13 January 1842 – 24 January 1932) was a British shipbuilder who started a shipbuilding dynasty, Yarrow Shipbuilders.

== Origins ==
Yarrow was born of humble origins in East London, the son of Esther (Lindo) and Edgar William Yarrow. His mother was of Spanish Sephardic Jewish background and his father was from an English Christian family; Yarrow was raised a Christian. He was educated at University College School.

== Shipbuilding ==
After serving an apprenticeship in nearby Stepney, he opened a yard – Yarrow and Hedley (a partnership) – at Folly Wall, Poplar on the Isle of Dogs in 1865 to build steam river launches. Yarrow&#x27;s stern wheel steamers, designed with a shallow draft suitable for river navigation, were used in the early stages of the 1884 Nile Expedition.

Yarrow ventured into military vessels from the early 1870s, building torpedo boats for the Argentine and Japanese navies, among other customers. Then in 1892 he built the first two destroyers for the Royal Navy: &quot;Havock&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; of the &quot;Havock&quot; class. He struck up a strong friendship and correspondence with Lord Fisher (&quot;Jackie Fisher&quot;), and subsequently Yarrow Shipbuilders became a lead contractor for the Royal Navy for smaller, but almost always fast, boats.

By this time, the Hedley partnership had been dissolved (1875), and the company was known as Yarrow &amp; Co, and around 1898 moved out of Folly shipyard to the nearby London Yard. It was to be a short-lived move, for less than 10 years later (1906–1908) Yarrow gradually moving his yard northwards to Scotstoun on the banks of the River Clyde on the west coast of Scotland, closing the London shipyard in 1908. An operation in Esquimalt, Canada, was purchased in 1913, renamed Yarrows Ltd., and after the Second World War sold to Burrard Dry Dock.

Yarrow&#x27;s strong naval engineering capabilities and inventive mind were behind a number of inventions designed to drive ships ever faster, and in 1912 he was appointed to the Royal Commission on Fuel and Engines. Long after he died, the shipyard remained famous throughout navies of the world for building smaller fast vessels.

== Personal life ==
He lived in Greenwich, London for some years, occupying Woodlands House in Mycenae Road, Westcombe Park for some years from 1896. In 1899, Yarrow encouraged a young engineer who lived nearby in Greenwich, Alexander Duckham, to specialise in lubricants, leading to the establishment of the Duckhams oil company.

Created a baronet in 1916, Sir Alfred displayed extensive philanthropic tendencies throughout his later years, donating towards: a convalescent home on the Isle of Dogs for the benefit of children; residences for soldiers&#x27; widows in Hampstead Garden Suburb (the Barnett Homestead, Erskine Hill); a school, the Royal Merchant Navy College, in Berkshire; a home and hospital for children in Broadstairs, Kent; a scholarship at University College London; fellowships for research in natural science at Girton College, Cambridge; a gallery at Oundle School in Northamptonshire; and medical research at the Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, among other noble causes. He also left a bequest to the Institution of Civil Engineers.

His first wife, married in 1875, was Minnie Florence Franklin, daughter of Theodosia (née Balderson; daughter of Major G. R. Balderson) and Frank Franklin. Frank&#x27;s family were Jewish emigrants from Germany. Yarrow&#x27;s daughter Minnie Ethel Yarrow was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE); she married on 18 December 1900 Dr Bertrand Dawson physician to King George V. The actor Damian Lewis is their great-grandson.

Yarrow married his second wife Eleanor Cecilia Barnes on 2 December 1922.

He was succeeded by his son Harold (1884–1962). His younger son, 2/Lt Eric Fernandez Yarrow (born 5 January 1895), was killed in action, aged 20, on 8 May 1915, whilst serving with the Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders. In 1918, he donated an Art Gallery to Oundle School in Eric&#x27;s memory which is known as the Yarrow Gallery. Son Norman Alfred Yarrow (10 July 1891 – 1956) ran Yarrows shipyards in Victoria, British Columbia.

Yarrow had two other daughters, Florence Yarrow (d. 8 March 1948) and Evelyn Yarrow (d. 13 January 1963).

He died on 24 January 1932 and is buried in Highgate Cemetery.

==Honours and recognition==

In addition to his Baronetcy he was further honoured in 1922 as a Fellow of the Royal Society, and received an honorary degree of LLD from Glasgow University in 1924. 

He was inducted into the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame in 2024.

<text>Alexander Ales or Alexander Alesius (; born Alexander Alane; 23 April 150017 March 1565) was a Scottish theologian who emigrated to Germany and became a Lutheran supporter of the Augsburg Confession.

== Life ==
Originally Alexander Alane, he was born at Edinburgh. He studied at St Andrews in the newly founded college of St Leonard&#x27;s, where he graduated in 1515. Some time afterwards he was appointed a priest at the University&#x27;s church, where he preached vigorously in favor of scholastic theology, Renaissance humanism, and anti-Protestantism. His views entirely changed, however, upon witnessing the 1528 execution by burning of Rev. Patrick Hamilton, a Lutheran Pastor and former abbot of Fern. Fr. Ales was chosen to meet Hamilton in a theological debate, with a view to convincing him of the errors of Lutheranism, but the theological arguments of the Scottish minister and, above all, his fortitude at the stake impressed Alesius so powerfully that he immediately embraced Lutheran theology.

A sermon he preached before the Synod at St Andrews against the dissoluteness of the clergy offended the provost, who placed him in prison, and might have carried his resentment further if Alesius had not escaped to Germany in 1532. After travelling through northern Europe, he settled down at Wittenberg, where he befriended Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon and signed the Augsburg confession. Meanwhile, he was tried by the Bishops of the Catholic Church in Scotland for heresy and condemned to death &quot;in absentia&quot;. In 1533 a decree by the Scottish Bishops, prohibiting the reading of the New Testament by the laity, drew from Alesius a defence of the right of the people, in the form of an open letter to King James V of Scotland.

A reply to this by German Roman Catholic priest and Renaissance humanist Johann Cochlaeus was also addressed to the Scottish king and occasioned a second letter from Alesius, in which he amplified his argument with greater force and entered into more general questions. In August 1534 he and a few others were excommunicated at Holyrood by the deputy of the Archbishop of St Andrews. When King Henry VIII of England (1509–47) declared himself Supreme Head of the Church of England, Alesius was persuaded to go to England, where he was cordially received (August 1535) by the king and his pro-Protestant advisers, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer and Thomas Cromwell. He briefly attended the court of Henry&#x27;s queen, Anne Boleyn, of whom he thought very highly and he was actually in London during her downfall, trial, and execution by beheading, although it was Alesius&#x27; belief that Boleyn was not guilty of adultery or any of the other crimes for she was put to death. Later, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, Anne Boleyn&#x27;s daughter, Alesius wrote a letter to the new Queen detailing his memories of her mother.

After a short stay at Lambeth Palace he was appointed, through the influence of Cromwell, then chancellor of the university, to lecture on theology at the Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge; but when he had delivered a few expositions of the Hebrew psalms, he was prevented from continuing by the anti-Protestant party. 

Returning to London he supported himself for some time by practising as a physician. In 1537 he attended a convocation of the clergy, and at the request of Cromwell Alesius debated with John Stokesley, Bishop of London, on the nature of the sacraments. His argument was published in 1544 under the title 

In 1539 Alesius was compelled to flee for a second time to Germany, as a result of Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s fall from the King&#x27;s favour and the enactment of the statute of the Six Articles. He was appointed to a theological chair at the university of Frankfurt an der Oder, where he was the first professor to teach Lutheran theology. He was in England again for a short time during Edward VI&#x27;s reign, and was commissioned by Cranmer to make a Latin translation of the &quot;First Prayer-Book (1549) for the use of Martin Bucer, whose opinion was desired.

Returning to Leipzig he passed the remainder of his days in peace and honour, and was twice elected Rector of the University.

== Works ==
His writings were both exegetical and controversial, but chiefly the latter. They include &quot;Expositio Libri Psalmorum Davidis&quot; (1550). His controversial works refer to such subjects as the translation of the Bible into the vernacular, against Servetus, etc.

Alesius published a large number of exegetical, dogmatic and polemical works, of which over twenty are mentioned by Bale in his &quot;List of English Writers&quot;. In his controversial works he upholds the synergistic views of the Scottish theologian John Major. He displayed his interest in his native land by the publication of a &quot;Cohortatio ad Concordiam Pietatis, missa in Patriam suam&quot; (1544), which had the express approval of Luther, and a &quot;Cohortatio ad Pietatis Concordiam ineundam&quot; (1559).

<text>Johann Cochlaeus (Cochläus) (1479 – 10 January 1552) was a German humanist, music theorist, and controversialist.

==Life==
Originally Johann Dobneck, he was born of poor parents at Wendelstein (near Nuremberg), from which he obtained the punning surname Cochlaeus, for which he occasionally substituted Wendelstinus. Educated at Nuremberg by the humanist Heinrich Grieninger, he entered the University of Cologne in 1504, and there associated with Hermann von Neuenahr, Ulrich von Hutten, and other humanists. He also knew well Carl von Miltitz, who later became papal chamberlain. In 1507 he graduated; he left Cologne in May 1510 to become schoolmaster at Nuremberg, where he brought out several school manuals.

During the years 1515 to 1519 he traveled in Italy as tutor to three nephews of Willibald Pirkheimer. In 1515 he was at Bologna, hearing (with disgust) Eck&#x27;s disputation on the subject of usury, and associating with von Hutten among the humanists. He took his doctor&#x27;s degree at Ferrara (1517), and spent some time in Rome, where he was ordained priest.

In 1520 he became dean of the Liebfrauenkirche at Frankfurt. He maintained good relations with the episcopal court of Mainz and with Hieronymus Aleander of Worms, who applied to him for the purpose of a discussion on the best means of opposing Martin Luther. Cochlaeus became a controversialist against the Lutherans. He was present at the Diets of Worms (1521), and later at Speyer (1526 and 1529), Augsburg (1530) and Regensburg (1541).

In the autumn of 1523 he went to Rome as he did not feel safe at Frankfurt, but returned early in 1524. Meanwhile, his patrons and friends at Frankfurt had joined the reformers. Cochlaeus accompanied Lorenzo Campeggio, the papal nuncio in Holy Roman Empire, to the Convention of Regensburg as interpreter and member of the commission which discussed the reform of the clergy. His position at Frankfurt becoming untenable during the German Peasants&#x27; War, he fled to Cologne in 1525, and in 1526 received a canonry at St. Victor&#x27;s in Mainz. He attended the Diet of Speyer in 1526, but his hope of holding a disputation with Luther was not fulfilled. In 1529 he became secretary to George, Duke of Saxony, at Dresden and Meissen. The death of his patron (1539) compelled him to take flight. In September 1539 he became canon at Breslau, where he died.

==Works==

Cochlaeus was a prolific writer and a feared opponent, who attracted very little sympathy from any side. Though he himself was Catholic, his humanist ideas raised the suspicion of many Catholics, and his polemical writings won him the hatred of the Reformers.

He published under the name of Wendelstein his first piece, &quot;Musica&quot; (1507). His first theological works were &quot;De Utroque Sacerdotio&quot; (1520) and some smaller writings published in rapid succession. In During the following years he wrote tracts against Luther&#x27;s principal theses on the doctrine of justification, on the freedom of the will, and on Catholic teaching in &quot;De Gratia Sacramentorum&quot;, 1522; &quot;De Baptismo parvulorum&quot;, 1523; &quot;A commentary on 154 Articles&quot; and others. Luther engaged with Cochlæus only in a single work, &quot;Adversus Armatum Virum Cocleum&quot;.

In his &quot;Colloqium Cochlaei cum Luthero&quot;, Cochlaeus reported on his discussion with Luther on 24 April 1521 about issues, such as the origin of Luther&#x27;s doctrine of predestination, the Eucharist, and the authority of the Bible. (See Plowboy trope.) After writing a series of pamphlets discussing the main themes of Luther&#x27;s theology, Cochlaeus became convinced that any further argumentation with Luther was futile. Accordingly, instead of convincing Luther, Cochlaeus attempted to come to an agreement with Melanchthon at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, but without much success.

His historical biography of Luther was popular and influential. It became a model and source for later 
polemics, and the view expounded in it that the Protestant Reformation was nothing but an incidental jealousy between the Dominican and Augustinian orders had a wide circulation.
He left one of the few contemporary notices of the young Michael Servetus as well as notes on Tyndale&#x27;s abortive attempt to print his New Testament at Cologne in 1525.

<doc id="334738" wikidata="Q935885" url="?curid=334738" title="Maris (mythology)">
<text>Maris (or Mariś) was an Etruscan god often depicted as an infant or child and given many epithets, including &quot;Mariś Halna&quot;, &quot;Mariś Husrnana&quot; (&quot;Maris the Child&quot;), and &quot;Mariś Isminthians&quot;. He was the son of Hercle, the Etruscan equivalent of Heracles. On two bronze mirrors, Maris appears in scenes depicting an immersion rite presumably to ensure his immortality. Massimo Pallottino noted that Maris might have been connected to stories about the centaur Mares, the legendary ancestor of the Ausones, who underwent a triple death and resurrection.

Some scholars think he influenced Roman conceptions of the god Mars, but this is not universally held; more likely he was the god of fertility and love, similar to the greek Eros.

In the Lead Plaque of Magliano, he is called &quot;Maris Menita &quot; &quot;Maris the Maker&quot;, the full dedicatory line translated: 

::For Maris Menita (=&quot;the Maker&quot;), for the ancestors, also this previously mentioned annually appointed village-priest must make a dedication in the &quot;ciala,&quot; and in addition in the place of offering, and in the &quot;ichu&quot; house

<text>Stefan Czarniecki ( of the Łodzia coat of arms, 1599 – 16 February 1665) was a Polish nobleman, general and military commander. In his career, he rose from a petty nobleman to a magnate holding one of the highest offices in the Commonwealth, something that was unprecedented in the Commonwealth&#x27;s history. On 22 July 1664 he received the office of the Voivode of Kijów and on 2 January 1665, a few weeks before his death, he was given the office of Field Hetman (one of top military commanders) of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom. He is remembered as an accomplished military commander, and regarded as a Polish national hero. His status in Polish history is acknowledged by a mention of his name in the Polish national anthem.

Czarniecki made significant contributions fighting the Khmelnytsky Uprising, during the Russo-Polish War, and during the Polish–Swedish War (The Deluge). His use of guerrilla warfare against the Swedes is credited as one of the main reasons for the eventual Polish victory in this war.

== Biography ==

=== Early career ===

Stefan Czarniecki was born in 1599 on the family estate of Czarnca near Włoszczowa in southern Poland, into the szlachta (nobility) Czarniecki family. The date of his birth is only an assumption, as no documents exist to prove it without a doubt; most historians, as noted by historians Leszek Podhorodecki and Adam Kersten, accept the 1599 date, although historian Zdzisław Spieralski argued for 1604. His father, Krzysztof Czarniecki, was a soldier who participated in several wars in the late 16th and early 17th century, and eventually became a courtier to Polish queen Constance of Austria. Whereas historian Mirosław Nagielski notes that the Czarniecki family was not well off, which limited some of Stefan&#x27;s life chances, Podhorecki points out that they owned several villages and even a small town, and the family wealth was &quot;not small&quot;. However, Stefan had ten siblings (he himself was the sixth out of nine brothers), and divided into that many parts, the family resources would be stretched rather thinly. However, involvement with the queen&#x27;s court allowed Krzysztof to boost his sons&#x27; careers with his court influence, where they were often able to serve as young courtiers themselves.

Nothing is known about Stefan&#x27;s childhood. His family could not afford to send him to a university abroad (only one of his brothers would do so); therefore he embarked on a military career at an early age. Before that, he attended a Jesuit college, either in Kraków or Sandomierz, achieving a solid secondary education. After finishing his schooling, he became a courtier to then-royal prince and future king of Poland John II Casimir Vasa. As Stefan could not afford the equipment needed to join a hussar unit, he learned the art of war serving with the Lisowczycy mercenaries, joining them as towarzysz (companion, a junior cavalry officer) in the spring of 1621. Already an officer at the age of eighteen, he took part in the battle of Chocim (Khotyn) in 1621, where the Commonwealth army stopped the Ottomans and ended the Polish–Ottoman War (1620–21). His years with the brutal Lisowczycy mercenaries would impact his strategy in the latter years, where he would not hesitate to use any means necessary – including mistreatment of civilians – to achieve victory.

The next time he took arms was in 1623, when his brother Paweł received a nomination as a rotmistrz of light (cossack) cavalry of the regular army (wojsko kwarciane), and recruited some of his siblings, including Stefan, into his unit. They served under hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski in the campaigns against the Tatars in 1624 (participating in the battle of Martynów). In 1625 they took part in the quelling of a Cossack Zhmaylo Uprising. He fought later against Gustavus Adolphus (1626–1629) (part of the Polish–Swedish War). His light cavalry was used in reconnaissance, diversion, and raiding the enemy territory. In 1627 Stefan, serving in his brother&#x27;s chorągiew, was promoted to chorąży. On 6–7 August that year he participated in the battle of Tczew, where Gustavus Adolphus was nearly killed. During those years, he learned much from observing a master of military arts, hetman Koniecpolski, who often commanded the Polish army in which he served, and from Poland&#x27;s Swedish opponents, and earlier from the Cossacks and Tatars they fought.

As the Polish–Swedish war ended, in 1630, Czarniecki enlisted in the Habsburg forces and continued to fight against the Swedes, participating in the battle of Breitenfeld. In 1633 he joined the Commonwealth forces again, to fight under the new Polish king, Władysław IV, in the Smolensk War against Muscovy that lasted until 1634. During the Smolensk War he learned Western tactics used by the foreign mercenary troops. In December 1633 he commanded a raiding unit that successfully raided and pillaged behind the Russian lines, spreading terror, disrupting supply lines, and burning down the town of Kozelsk. For his achievements in that war, in which he advanced to a porucznik rank in the light &quot;cossack&quot; cavalry unit under hetman Marcin Kazanowski, he received some land in the Smolensk Voivodeship near Starodub.

After that war, he moved to a more prestigious hussar unit (rota), and likely due to a reduction of the royal army, he served in the private formation of Władysław Myszkowski and later, voivode Stanisław Lubomirski. In 1635 he might have served as a military adviser to John II Casimir Vasa, and possibly accompanied the king to Vienna. In 1637 he married Zofia Kobierzycka, and later that year he fought in the Pawluk Uprising against the rebellious Cossacks under Pavel Mikhnovych, participating in the battle of Kumejki. He led a cavalry charge at Kumejki which was instrumental in the Polish victory there. Earlier that year he served as a military delegate to the Sejm (parliament) in Warsaw.

=== Struggles against the Cossacks ===

For the next several years he would serve on the hostility-plagued south-eastern border, where he made his home in the city of Illńce. In 1644 under Koniecpolski he took part in the battle of Ochmatów where Commonwealth forces dealt a crushing defeat to Toğay bey&#x27;s (Tuhaj Bej) Tatars. He served as one of seven pułkowniks in Koniecpolski&#x27;s army, and once again his cavalry unit charge proved to be a decisive moment of the battle, bringing him much fame. That year he also became a regimentarz in his own light cavalry unit, but he still held the rank of a porucznik of hussars.

He took an active part in the battles against the Cossacks in the Khmelnytsky Uprising. On 16 May 1648 he was one of the many noble Polish prisoners who fell into the hands of Bohdan Khmelnytsky at the battle of Zhovti Vody, but he was quickly ransomed. He participated in the defense of the Kudak Fortress, which surrendered on 26 September; he was once again captured and not released until the autumn of 1649, in the aftermath of the Treaty of Zboriv. He served as a porucznik in the hussar chorągiew of hetman Mikołaj Potocki, a military judge deputized by the hetman, and a member of his staff, meeting with the new king of Poland, John Casimir Vasa. He was part of the fighting at the battle of Berestechko and battle of Bila Tserkva in 1651. He received the title of chorąży of Sandomierz, and was elected the military deputy for the Sejm in January 1652. According to Nagielski, Czarniecki, while returning from the Sejm, witnessed the massacre of Polish prisoners in the aftermath of the battle of Batoh; This scene made him reject the notions that a compromise with the enemies of the Commonwealth was a likely or desired outcome. Podhorodecki however notes that another historian, Wojciech Jacek Długołęcki, questions Czarniecki&#x27;s presence there, and concludes that we have no conclusive proof whether Czarniecki was present at Batoh, The massacre further escalated the hostilities and the surrounding hatred; illustrating that in a letter Czarniecki wrote soon after the battle, in which he promised that if enough military forces are gathered and given to him, he will leave few Ruthenians alive.

Later that year Czarniecki received territories from the king, along with the office of Crown oboźny. In 1653 he led a unit to Ukraine, ransacking much of the Cossack-held lands, although the attrition among the troops was high. During that campaign Czarniecki was wounded at Monastyryshsche. He continued his suppression campaign in 1654, and the following January took part in the battle of Okhmativ. In May 1655 he was called from Ukraine to Warsaw, as the king John Casimir Vasa, respected his experience and requested his presence at a new war council, convened to discuss the looming thread of the war with Sweden. At that time his reputation was significant; Sejm often passed resolutions applauding him for his efforts to reclaim Ukraine, and he was even held in much consideration by the Ottomans, then temporarily allied with the Commonwealth. On 14 May 1655 he received the office of the castellan of Kiev, a position that made him a member of the Senate of Poland.

From Autumn of 1654 to Spring of 1655 during the &quot;Bracław Campaign&quot; Stefan Czarniecki&#x27;s army with the support of Crimean Tatars murdered 100,000 Ukrainians.

=== The Swedish Deluge ===
When Charles X of Sweden invaded Poland in 1655, Czarniecki distinguished himself by his defence of Kraków, which he eventually surrendered on good terms, retreating with his army. He remained loyal to the Polish king, even when much of the army, including most of the senators and the hetmans, temporarily joined the Swedes. His vocal support for the wavering king, who at that time found refuge abroad, and was considering abdication, was decisive. For his continuing support, the Polish king rewarded him with more lands, and the office of regimentarz of the royal army.

He led guerrilla warfare against Swedish troops of Charles X, a type of a campaign he authored, despite the objections of the hetmans, who by that time returned to serve under John Casmimir Vasa. The mobile Swedish forces, even with their significant firepower, proved to be rather vulnerable to Czarniecki&#x27;s guerrilla-style warfare. Czarniecki was defeated at the battle of Gołąb in mid-February 1656, but later inflicted serious defeats upon the Swedes, notably at the Battle of Warka in April that year. The tide of the war turned several times that year, and he was again defeated at the battle of Kłecko and battle of Kscynia. His defeats, however, were limited, and in most cases he was able to retreat with most of his army in good order. Under his direction the popular rising against the Swedish troops in Greater Poland proved highly successful. It was against his advice that the battle of Warsaw was fought, and his subsequent strategy neutralized the ill effects of this defeat. Despite support from the king, Czarniecki was seen by many older, established noble family as an arrogant newcomer, and they prevented him from getting the hetman office that year; instead early next year he received the office of the voivode of Ruthenia, and an extraordinary title of the &quot;general and vice commander of the royal forces&quot;, which put him in a position of an unofficial hetman-like authority. The Field Crown Hetmanship went to Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, also an accomplished commander, if not so much as Czarniecki – but from a magnate Lubomirski family; Czarniecki commented famously that &quot;Not of salt, or fields, I am, but from what hurts me&quot;, alluding to the fact that Lubormirski family built its fortune on salt trade and agriculture, whereas his smaller one was built through military service – yet it was money and politics, not military experience, that decided who was to get the hetman&#x27;s office.

=== Final battles ===
In 1657 he was instrumental in defeating the forces of George II Rákóczi at the battle of Magierów. In 1658 and 1659 he aided Danes during the Danish–Swedish War, fighting at Als and at the battle of Kolding.

On the conclusion of the Peace of Oliwa, which adjusted the long outstanding differences between Poland and Sweden, Czarniecki was transferred to the eastern frontier where the war with Russia reignited. He distinguished himself in the campaign of 1660, where he won the victories of the battle of Połonka and battle of Kuszliki. This campaign, however, marked the zenith of his popularity. King John II Casimir Vasa attempted to involve him in the unpopular plan of &quot;vivente rege&quot; – to bypass the traditions of the royal elections in Poland and instead chose the next successor to the Polish throne (John II Casimir favored Louis, Grand Condé) still during the life of the previous king. His reputation among the unpaid and dissenting military took a dive; and many criticized him for appropriating the entire ransom that the Russians paid for their prisoners from Połonka. During the Sejm of 1662 some military representatives demanded sanctions and punishments to be levied on him.

His last campaign took place at the end of 1664. He led an army against the Russians, but the Siege of Hlukhiv was not successful, and a new Cossack uprising of Ivan Sirko forced the Polish troops to fall back.

On 22 July 1664 he received the office of the voivode of Kiev, and on 2 January 1665 he was appointed Field Crown Hetman. Before receiving the news of the nomination he desired for years, he was wounded at Lysianka. Called back by the king, who feared that magnate Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski that he just banished might start a rebellion, his recent wound became infected, and he died on 16 February 1665 in Sokołówka (now Sokolívka) near Lwów, six weeks after receiving this supreme distinction.

== Legacy ==

Czarniecki received a state funeral in Warsaw, and has been interred in the tomb chapel of the church founded by him in Czarnca. He left his estates to a nephew, Stefan Stanisław Czarniecki, but the Czarniecki name did not last long, and the wealth he gathered became instead the foundation of the Branicki family of magnates.

Czarniecki is remembered as one of the most able Polish commanders of all times. Podhorecki called him the greatest Polish military expert in &quot;hit-and-run tactics&quot;, and notes that he was the longest-serving of the major Polish military commanders of his era, that he participated in 27 large battles, commanding 17 of them. He is seen as instrumental in defeating the Swedes during the Deluge, although he was even more successful in his battles against the Russians. His career, rising from a simple noble family to the rank of a hetman and a wealthy magnate, was unprecedented in the Commonwealth&#x27;s history.

His legend had begun growing even during his lifetime, as he became a hero of poems and songs. Few negative rumors about him, popular in the last few years of his life, survived after his death. During the period of Enlightenment in Poland he was written about by poets and writers such as Stanisław Potocki, Franciszek Karpiński, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Franciszek Ksawery Dmowski. A biography by Michał Krajewski cemented his legend of a hero rescuing Poland from anarchy and invasion. That legend that became even stronger during the times of the partitions of Poland in the 19th century, where the artists of the Polish romanticism period used him as a symbol of patriotism, and a reminder of military successes. He appears in the poem &quot;Przedświt&quot; of Zygmunt Krasiński, but much more significant was his portrayal in The Trilogy of Henryk Sienkiewicz, particularly the second book, &quot;The Deluge&quot;.
It was during that time that his pursuit of the retreating Swedes to Pomerania and Denmark (1658–1659), particularly his crossing with his entire army to the Danish isle of Alsen, was commemorated in the song of the Polish Napoleonic Legions that would eventually become the Polish national anthem, the &quot;Dąbrowski&#x27;s Mazurka&quot;, with the words commemorating his marine excursion to the island of Als: It was only during the time of the Second Polish Republic when more modern, serious historical work begun analyzing his history that a less hagiographic account begun emerging; Władysław Czapliński wrote that Czarniecki was &quot;first and foremost a soldier&quot;, and noted his faults such as brutality and greed. Modern historiography of Czarniecki includes works of Czapliński, Stanisław Herbst, Adam Kersten and Zdzisław Spieralski; however Podhorecki notes that while he has been a major figure in the Polish history, and is discussed extensively in Polish historiography, he has never been a subject of much interest to foreign historians, concluding that he was a major persona in Polish, but not European, history.

<text>The , commonly abbreviated as , is an early anthology of the &quot;waka&quot; form of Japanese poetry, dating from the Heian period. An imperial anthology, it was conceived by Emperor Uda () and published by order of his son Emperor Daigo () in about 905. Its finished form dates to 920, though according to several historical accounts the last poem was added to the collection in 914.

The compilers of the anthology were four court poets, led by Ki no Tsurayuki and also including Ki no Tomonori (who died before its completion), Ōshikōchi no Mitsune, and Mibu no Tadamine.

==Significance==
The &quot;Kokinshū&quot; is the first of the , the 21 collections of Japanese poetry compiled at Imperial request. It was the most influential realization of the ideas of poetry at the time, dictating the form and format of Japanese poetry until the late nineteenth century; it was the first anthology to divide itself into seasonal and love poems. The primacy of poems about the seasons pioneered by the &quot;Kokinshū&quot; continues even today.

The Japanese preface by Ki no Tsurayuki is also the beginning of Japanese criticism as distinct from the far more prevalent Chinese poetics in the literary circles of its day. The anthology also included a Classical Chinese preface authored by Ki no Yoshimochi. The idea of including old as well as new poems was another important innovation, one which was widely adopted in later works, both in prose and verse. The poems of the &quot;Kokinshū&quot; were ordered temporally; the love poems, for instance, though written by many different poets across large spans of time, are ordered in such a way that the reader may understand them to depict the progression and fluctuations of a courtly love-affair. This association of one poem to the next marks this anthology as the ancestor of the &quot;renga&quot; and &quot;haikai&quot; traditions.

==Structure==
The exact number of poems in the collection varies depending on the textual tradition. One online edition, which follows the Date Family text based on a manuscript prepared by Fujiwara no Teika, contains 1,111 poems. The collection is divided into twenty parts, reflecting older models such as the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; and various Chinese anthologies. The organization of topics is however different from all earlier models, and was followed by all later official collections, although some collections like the &quot;Kin&#x27;yō Wakashū&quot; and &quot;Shika Wakashū&quot; scaled the model down to ten parts.

The following divisions of the &quot;Kokinshū&quot; mention the Japanese names of the parts, their modern readings, and their English translations.

The compilers included the name of the author of each poem, and the or inspiration of the poem, if known. Major poets of the &quot;Kokinshū&quot; include Ariwara no Narihira, Ono no Komachi, Henjō and Fujiwara no Okikaze, apart from the compilers themselves. Inclusion in any imperial collection, and particularly the &quot;Kokinshū&quot;, was a great honour.

==Manuscripts==
On October 20, 2010, Kōnan Women&#x27;s University announced the discovery of a complete manuscript dating to . It is the oldest manuscript to contain both the Chinese and Japanese prefaces. It is split into two volumes, 15.9 cm tall by 14.6 cm wide, totaling 429 pages containing all 1111 poems. It is thought to be a copy of a manuscript made by Fujiwara no Teika, but the identity of the copier is unknown. The manuscript was purchased from a used book store in 1982 for 4,280,000 yen.

==Translations==
A translation by Laurel Rasplica Rodd titled &quot;Kokinshū: A Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern&quot; was published in 1984 by Princeton University Press. Torquil Duthie translated a selection of one-third of the anthology under the title &quot;The Kokinshū: Selected Poems&quot;, published in 2023 by Columbia University Press. Both translations won the Japan–U.S. Friendship Commission Prize for the Translation of Japanese Literature: Rodd&#x27;s in 1982 and Duthie&#x27;s in 2023.

<text>Volvo&#x27;s first overhead valve passenger car engine was the inline-four B4B of 1944 and its descendants, the B14A and B16. These were cast iron engines, and used just three main bearings.

==B4B==

Introduced in 1944, the B4B displaced and powered the Volvo PV444. It was a departure for Volvo who had not produced an automobile with a four-cylinder engine in nearly 20 years. The B4B was equipped with a single down-draught carburetor. Suppliers of ancillaries included Autolite (ignition distributors and generators), Zenith and Carter Carburetors, and Bosch (ignition distributors, generators and starter motors.)

==B14A==

The B14A was essentially a twin carb version of the B4B. These two engines were nearly identical, except for the induction systems. The B14A carb system was supplied by the British SU Carburettor concern and the carbs used were designated HS2. These diminutive carbs, familiar to any English sports car fan, improved the acceleration and overall performance of the B4B which in turn accomplished Volvo&#x27;s corporate desire to make the PV444 cars powered by these engines more attractive to the American audience, whose attention Volvo hoped to gain.

While B14A engines are considered rare in the US setting, they were even rarer in Europe. The production run lasted for one year. Some of the earliest P1900 roadsters were built with B14s but many of the short production of 67 of these open fiberglass cars received the replacement for the B14 — the B16.

==B16==

The B16A and B16B (single carb and twin carbs respectively) were a bored out development of the B14A which in turn was sired by the B4B. These engines were fitted to the PV444 in its final two years (1957 and 1958), the Volvo PV544 in its 1958 introduction, as well as the companion estate and van versions known as Volvo P445, Volvo P210, and Volvo Duett. A new Volvo automobile introduced in 1956, known in some markets as the Volvo Amazon or Volvo 122 was the first production Volvo to sport this engine in any significant number although some of the later examples of the short-lived Volvo P1900 were also fitted with them. Other applications of this engine found use in marine, industrial and agricultural settings. The Volvo BM T425 tractor is one such example of a non-automotive use for the B16.

The exterior of the B16 resembled that of the B14, which it replaced. The block and the cylinder heads appeared to be similar at first glance. The B16B sported twin SU HS4 carbs, notably larger than the B14A&#x27;s HS2 carbs. Also, the remote oil filter attached next to the water pump on the ignition distributor side of the engine on the B14 had been relocated to a housing under the intake and exhaust manifold side on the B16. The exhaust manifold which dumped centrally on the B14 now was made to exit towards the rear of the B16 manifold.

In automotive applications, the B16 was featured from 1957 to 1961 model years although in marine and industrial applications it was used for a number of years after. It was replaced in 1962 model year cars by the 5 main-bearing B18 engine of 1.8 litres which had been first seen by the automotive public in the 1961 Volvo P1800 sports car. With the discontinuation of the B16 also came the end of 6 volt electrical systems in Volvo cars.
