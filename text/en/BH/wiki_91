<text>The Time Tunnel is an American color science-fiction television series written around a theme of time travel adventure; it starred James Darren and Robert Colbert. The show was creator-producer Irwin Allen&#x27;s third science-fiction television series and was released by 20th Century Fox Television and broadcast on ABC. The show ran for one season of 30 episodes from 1966 to 1967. A new pilot was produced in 2002, but failed to proceed to a series.
==Premise==
Project Tic-Toc is a top-secret U.S. government effort to build an experimental time machine, known as &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; due to its appearance as an elliptical passageway. The base for Project Tic-Toc is a huge, hidden underground complex in Arizona, 800 floors deep and employing more than 12,000 specialized personnel. The directors of the project are Dr. Douglas Phillips (Colbert), Dr. Anthony Newman (Darren), and Lt. General Heywood Kirk (Whit Bissell). The specialists assisting them are Dr. Raymond Swain (John Zaremba), a foremost expert in electronics, and Dr. Ann MacGregor (Lee Meriwether), an electrobiologist supervising the unit that determines how much force and heat a time traveler is able to withstand. The series is set in 1968, two years into the future from the actual broadcast season, 1966–1967.

Project Tic-Toc is in its 10th year when United States Senator Leroy Clark (Gary Merrill) comes to investigate to determine whether the project, which has cost $7.5 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ), is worth continuing. Senator Clark feels the project is a waste of government funds. When speaking to Phillips, Kirk, and Newman in front of the Time Tunnel, he delivers an ultimatum – either they send someone into time and return him during the course of his visit or their funding will cease. Tony volunteers for this endeavor, but he is turned down by project director Doug Phillips. Defying this decision, Tony sends himself into time. Doug follows shortly after to rescue him, but they both continue to be lost in time. Senator Clark returns to Washington with the promise that funding will not be cut off to the project, leaving General Kirk in charge.

The stage is set for the progress of the series as Tony and Doug are now &quot;switched&quot; from one period in history to another, allowing episodes to be set in the past and future. Episodes two through 23 begin with the following narration (voiced by Dick Tufeld):

Tony and Doug become participants in past events such as the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, the attack on Pearl Harbor, the eruption of Krakatoa, Custer&#x27;s Last Stand, and the Battle of the Alamo, among others. General Kirk, Ray, and Ann in the control room are able to locate them in time and space, observe them, occasionally communicate with them through voice contact, and send help. The series was abruptly cancelled in the summer of 1967 by ABC, before they were able to film the episode in which Tony and Doug are safely returned to the Time Tunnel complex.

==Possibility of time travel==

According to the plot, time travel is facilitated by time being portrayed as a static continuum, accessible at any point through the Time Tunnel as a corridor spanning its infinite reaches. When Senator Clark sees an image of the &quot;Titanic&quot; on the image screen in the course of episode one, he is told by Dr. Swain that he is seeing &quot;the living past&quot;, and Althea Hall is told by Tony Newman that the past and the future are the same. The Time Tunnel is also a portal connecting the Time Tunnel &quot;complex&quot; with the same time periods in which Doug and Tony are located. Other people can also be relocated by the Time Tunnel from their time to another time as Machiavelli is switched from his own time to the time of the Gettysburg Campaign of 1863. Bringing people (other than Tony and Doug) to the present happens often in the series, but the only occasion in which Tony and Doug return to their own time occurs in &quot;Merlin the Magician&quot;, when the great wizard uses magic to bring them home in suspended animation so he can instruct them to perform a mission for him.

In the course of the series, Doug, Tony, and the Time Tunnel personnel discover that events of the past can be altered to some extent by the intrusion of the time travelers, and in a few cases, their historical research allows for it. Episode 26 (&quot;Attack of the Barbarians&quot;) explores the scenario of one of the time travelers falling in love with someone from the past: Tony and the Princess Serit, daughter of Kublai Khan. Marco Polo tells Doug, &quot;Can they not touch each other?&quot; History itself hints at the possibility of Serit marrying Tony as Ann informs General Kirk. The historical information on Billy the Kid&#x27;s victims alarms Ann, Ray, and the General, as it records that he killed two strangers near Lincoln, New Mexico, in April 1881—just when Tony, Doug, and Billy the Kid are brought together.

==Production==
The production used sets, stock footage, and props left over from the large number of period dramas made by the 20th Century Fox film company. Even black-and-white shots purporting to show the &quot;Titanic&quot; sinking were tinted for use in this color production. Only a few actors were costumed for a given episode, interspersed with cuts of great masses of people similarly dressed from original features. Only one set was constructed for the show, that of the Time Tunnel&#x27;s main control room. For the pilot episode, a large control-room set was built, and a longer Time Tunnel was created using optical matte shots. After the pilot episode, location changes occurred for the production of the series; Colbert and Darren shot their scenes in another studio, on the 20th Century Fox backlot, or on location, while those who portrayed the Time Tunnel personnel filmed all their scenes on a revised and smaller Time Tunnel control-room set (due to the production having to use a smaller sound stage than used during the pilot filming). Some episodes featured space aliens who wore costumes and carried props originally created for other Irwin Allen television and film productions. Prop sets were similarly reused. The prop computer, however, had an unusual degree of verisimilitude because it was an array of memory modules from the Air Force&#x27;s recently decommissioned SAGE computer.

Continuity errors and errors in historical fact occurred in the series. In the premiere episode, &quot;Rendezvous with Yesterday&quot;, Captain Smith of the &quot;Titanic&quot; is called Malcolm, when historically, his name was Edward. The names of the secondary officers are also fictitious, though Walter Lord&#x27;s best-selling nonfiction book about the event, &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, had been released nine years earlier. Tony states that he was born in 1938. A few episodes later in &quot;The Day the Sky Fell in&quot;, he states he was seven when Pearl Harbor was attacked on 7 December 1941, which would make the year of his birth 1934, or possibly 1933, if later than 7 December. For comparison, Darren&#x27;s birthdate is June 8, 1936, about midway between 1934 and 1938.

The music for the opening and closing credits heard in each episode of the series was composed by John Williams (credited, as in &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, as &quot;Johnny Williams&quot;). GNP Crescendo later released an album featuring Williams&#x27; work and the score composed by George Duning for the episode &quot;The Death Merchant&quot;.

The series won an Emmy Award in 1967, for Individual Achievements in Cinematography. The award went to L. B. &quot;Bill&quot; Abbott, for his photographic special effects.

==Recurring elements==
* A short &quot;teaser&quot; from the following week&#x27;s episode was shown at the end of each episode as Doug and Tony arrived at their next destination, with one exception: episode three&#x27;s ending teaser has a scene where Tony lands 10 years before 1968 in the desert, at the Time Tunnel complex. He tries to tell Doug that he works there, and he knows him. This was not to be seen in the following episode.
* The impressive introduction to the scale of the project (over 36,000 people and huge underground buildings) is never seen after the first episode except for two clips of the giant power generator flashing, and tunnel security running across a walkway. New matte paintings and models were created specifically for &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; pilot episode.
* Most episodes involved the capture or detention of Doug, Tony, or both, their escape, their recapture, and their escape &quot;again&quot;, before their move to the next episode.
* Nearly all location shooting was filmed in and around Southern California. This caused scenes set in different parts of the country (or the world) to have the same general hilly landscape with arid-type trees and brush typical to the local region where filming occurred.
* The majority of episodes placed Tony and Doug in stories set in past historical contexts.
* Aliens and people from the future were similarly dressed, often in metallic silver clothing, like other Irwin Allen television series of the same era.
* Many episodes used stock footage from previous 20th Century-Fox and Irwin Allen productions. These shots ran the gamut from episodes on General Custer, to the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, and many other historical events.

==Episodes==
While the episodes were first shown in 1966, the show&#x27;s setting begins in 1968, two years into the then-future.
==Cancellation==
Although &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; was scheduled on Fridays (often considered the &quot;Friday night death slot&quot; for TV programs), the ratings for the series were solid. ABC pointed to &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; as one of the few successes in a disastrous schedule.

A series titled &quot;The Legend of Custer&quot; was lobbied to drop &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; in favor of &quot;Custer&quot;. The network headquarters gave green light for &quot;Custer&quot;, and &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; was cancelled.

&quot;The Legend of Custer&quot; was itself cancelled after airing 17 low-rated episodes, skewered by critics and performed worse than &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;.

==In other media==
=== Tie-in novels ===
In January 1967 a promotional novel, &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;, was published by Pyramid Books. Its author Murray Leinster, had written a novel of the same name in 1964 entirely unrelated to the television series. 

Leinster used four of the main characters: Tony Newman, Doug Phillips, General Kirk, and Ann MacGregor and initial antagonist Senator Clark. Unlike in the television series, Project Tic-Toc is secretly founded and financed through the Defense Department without the consent of Congress. General Kirk is a retired Air Force General rather than an active duty Army General. Also differing form the series, Senator Clark, here demands the end of Project Tic-Toc out of fear of [grandfather paradox]] which could result in the erasure of the current timeline. THe action takes place during the Johnstown Flood of May 31, 1889, where the traveler&#x27;s save Clark&#x27;s grandmother, Julie Bowen., the Texas prairie near Adobe Walls, Texas, June 26, 1874, prior to the historic battle on June 27. Lastly, they visit Saint Louis, Missouri sometime in the distant future. during an alien invasion . In the Saint Louis library Doug discovers that he will marry Ann MacGregor. They then return to the present.

This was followed , also in 1967, by&quot;Timeslip: Time Tunnel Adventure&quot; #2, written again by Murray Leinster. The front and back covers feature photos from the series. Here, an experimental nuclear missile is sent through the Time Tunnel, but lands up at the bottom of a pond in Mexico City, in the 1840s. Newman and Phillips are sent out to make the event &quot;unhappen&quot;.

===Comic books===
A short-lived comic book was published by Gold Key Comics (Western Publishing Co.) in 1966–1967. These were reprinted by Hermes Press in 2012. In the first issue, the travelers meet Abraham Lincoln on the day of his assassination, then visit Pompeii in 79 A.D, then visit 1980 when a trip Mars takes place. In the second issue, the travelers visit D-Day 1944 and discover Nazis armed with weapons from the future, then visit Custer in 1876 on the day of his death.

===DVD releases===
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the entire series on DVD in Region 1 in 2006 in two volumes. Volume Two includes the unaired 2002 pilot and the made-for-TV film &quot;Time Travelers&quot; as special features. The DVD box sets include nearly all full-length, uncut and unedited original network prints, but one episode, &quot;Chase Through Time&quot;, was edited.

In Region 2, Revelation Films released the entire series on DVD in the UK in one complete series box set.

In Region 4, Madman Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Australia on August 20, 2014.

=== Blu-ray releases ===
In Region B, Revelation Films has released the entire series on Blu-ray in the UK in one set. Though made for the UK, the Blu-ray set is in fact all-region and plays in US players.

===Record album===
&quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; ABC-TV Japanese book with record album was released in 1967. 33⅓ RPM record was licensed and manufactured for exclusive release in Japan by Asahi Sonorama company and was released during the show&#x27;s original airing. The record is pressed in blue-vinyl and contains the time-travel drama &quot;Adventure in the Lost World&quot;. The highlight of this package is the colorful 12-page booklet which showcases original storybook artwork of the record&#x27;s episode with the intrepid time travelers being terrorized by rampaging dinosaurs and angry cavemen.

===Soundtrack album===
An album of music from the series, featuring the episodes &quot;Rendezvous With Yesterday&quot; (tracks 2-4) and &quot;The Death Merchant&quot; (tracks 5 and 6) was released by GNP Crescendo as part of the collection &quot;The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen&quot;.

==After the original run==
In 1982, five feature-length television films were assembled from 10 complete individual episodes with portions of the first episode as introductory material. &quot;Aliens from Another Planet&quot;, was produced using episodes 24 (&quot;Chase Through Time&quot;) and 18 (&quot;Visitors from Beyond the Stars&quot;). &quot;Revenge of the Gods&quot; was a compilation of episodes 7 (&quot;Revenge of the Gods&quot;) and 20 (&quot;The Walls of Jericho&quot;). &quot;Old Legends Never Die&quot; edited together episodes 27 (&quot;Merlin the Magician&quot;) and 16 (&quot;The Revenge of Robin Hood&quot;). &quot;Kill or Be Killed&quot; comprised episodes 4 (&quot;The Day the Sky Fell In&quot;) and 17 (&quot;Kill Two by Two&quot;). &quot;Raiders from Outer Space&quot; was compiled from episodes 28 (&quot;The Kidnappers&quot;) and 2 (&quot;One Way to the Moon&quot;). The five &quot;films&quot; were made available to tv stations to fit either a 2-hour slot (100 minutes) or a 90-minute slot (75 minutes), with different edits for time.

==Remakes==
To date, three attempts have been made to resurrect the show. Two produced a pilot episode, and another got no further than a script.

===1976 remake===
===2002 remake===
In 2002, Fox showed interest in remaking this series. A pilot was produced by Twentieth Century Fox Television, Fox Television Studios, and Regency Television in association with Irwin Allen Properties. Kevin Burns and Jon Jashni were executive producers. Sheila Allen was credited as one of the producers. The series was not ordered by Fox so as to make room in its schedule for Joss Whedon&#x27;s &quot;Firefly&quot;.

The pilot had a darker and more serious tone than the original 1966 series. Doug Phillips (David Conrad) is the main character, and the other is Toni Newman (Andrea Roth). The unaired pilot episode is available on DVD from Fox Home Entertainment on &quot;The Time Tunnel: Volume Two&quot;.

In this remake, the 2002 Time Tunnel is a Department of Energy research project into nuclear fusion, which produces nearly limitless energy. When the reactor was initiated (not shown in the episode), that caused an unintended &quot;time storm&quot; which uncontrollably changed history. The DOE was able to anchor one end of the storm by using the Tunnel like a lightning rod.

On their way into the tunnel complex, Flynn tells Doug Phillips, a former friend, that the latter has been recruited because he has a detailed knowledge of the Battle of Hürtgen Forest. The head of the Time Tunnel project likens their team to FEMA—they don&#x27;t send a team back for a rain storm but they do for hurricanes. However, they can only go through time to where the other end of the storm is at the current moment, so they have a limited period to fix what is wrong and to be retrieved by the Time Tunnel.

The team (Doug, Toni, Flynn, J.D., and Wix) must travel to the Battle of Hürtgen Forest in 1944 Germany during World War II. They plan to retrieve a person moved there by the time storm from 1546. During the mission, Doug Phillips meets his grandfather, a soldier who will be killed in the battle. Doug knows this, but cannot tell his ancestor and save his life because it would change history. Toni Newman tells Doug she used to have three brothers and two sisters before the time storm accident but is now an only child. The time travelers learn the displaced person is a now-confused medieval monk who carries bubonic plague. When the team is almost captured, two members switch to German uniforms and pretend to be Colonel Klink and (Sergeant) Schultz, complete with fake documents. Everyone who came in contact with the monk is given an antibiotic injection and the time ripples stop, but Flynn has been fatally stabbed, so he reveals Phillips was a lonely single man before the time storm, but he now has a family. Flynn tells Phillips this information to give him an incentive to keep the timeline intact.

===2006 remake===
The SciFi Channel announced in 2005 to create a new pilot for its 2006/07 season. Allen&#x27;s wife, Sheila, and two producers of the 2002 FOX remake (Kevin Burns and Jon Jashni) began work on the new pilot. John Turman (&quot;Hulk&quot;) wrote the script. The series never went beyond a pilot script.

==Parodies==
A recurring sketch called &quot;Drunk In Time&quot; starred Alexei Sayle and Peter Capaldi as two men so inebriated that they weren&#x27;t aware they were time travellers. Featuring a mock up of the original Project Tic-Toc set and animated Time Tunnel-style title sequence, the main characters are also called Doug and Tony. The six sketches featured in &quot;The All New Alexei Sayle Show&quot; in 1995.

<text>The Bernoulli Box (or simply Bernoulli, named after Bernoulli&#x27;s principle) is a high-capacity (at the time of release) removable disk storage system that was Iomega&#x27;s first widely known product. It was first released in 1982.

==Overview==
The original Bernoulli Box &quot;Alpha-10&quot; is a 10 MB removable disk drive that spins a disk made of PET film at about 1500 rpm, 1 μm above a read-write head. Utilizing Bernoulli&#x27;s principle, the rotation of the disk pulls the flexible disk media down towards the read/write head, and will continue to do so for as long as the disk is spinning. This was in an attempt to make the Bernoulli drive more reliable than a contemporaneous hard disk drive, since a head crash is made physically impossible: should the disk stop spinning for any reason, it immediately pulls away from the read/write head, preventing damage.

The Bernoulli Box was released in capacities of 10 and, later, 20 MB, and its cartridges measure 8.23 x 11.02 x 0.71 inches, about the size of a standard piece of letter paper (albeit thicker). Bernoulli Boxes could be configured at time of purchase for either one or two drives within a single enclosure. A drive subsystem can be connected to a host computer via a proprietary interface card that utilizes a 37-pin SCSI connector.

In 1985, a 5 MB, RS-422 serial version of the Bernoulli Box, specific to the original Macintosh and Macintosh 512K, was released. The cartridges for this Macintosh-only version have a smaller capacity of just 5 MB. However, they are also physically smaller than their predecessors, measuring just 5.5 x 7.4 x 0.53 inches. With the release of the Macintosh Plus in 1986 (and its on-board SCSI interface), the 5MB Bernoulli Box was quickly discontinued, and the 10 and 20 MB versions were adapted for the Macintosh Plus&#x27;s 25-pin SCSI connector.

The most popular system was the Bernoulli Box II, whose cartridges are 13.6 cm wide, 14 cm long, and 0.9 cm thick, somewhat resembling a 5¼-inch standard floppy disk. The Bernoulli Box II was initially released with just a 20 MB capacity, but was quickly followed up by drives with capacities of 44 MB, then 90 MB (with varying levels of backwards compatibility). Eventually, a so-called &quot;MultiDisk&quot; drive was released which sported a maximum capacity of 150 MB, but which could also read and write without penalty to other &quot;MultiDisk&quot; cartridges, specifically: 35 MB, 65 MB, and 105 MB, in addition to 150 MB.

By 1993, a 230 MB Bernoulli Box was released which boosted the maximum possible capacity, and which was also backwards compatible with most previous capacities (albeit at a performance penalty).

Bernoulli Box II drives were sold as either internal units which fit into standard 5¼-inch drive bays, or as external units, with either one or two drives within a self-contained enclosure, similar to the original Bernoulli Box, and which connected to the host computer via the external SCSI connector.

All versions of the Bernoulli Box II use a SCSI interface, but external drives can also be converted for use with a Parallel port interface using a special adapter.

Cartridges for both the original Bernoulli Box, as well as the Bernoulli Box II, have a physical switch on them, analogous to that of a standard 3½-inch floppy disk, in order to enable and disable write protection.

==Reception==
&quot;PC Magazine&quot; in 1984 stated that the Bernoulli Box &quot;... combines the advantages of [standard] floppy- and hard-disk systems without their drawbacks.&quot; It reported no software-compatibility problems and cited the box&#x27;s durable design. Bruce Webster of &quot;BYTE&quot; wrote favorably of the peripheral in February 1986, reporting that &quot;I have not had a single glitch or lost file&quot; in nine months of constant use.

==Successors==
Iomega&#x27;s later removable-storage products such as the Zip drive and Jaz and Rev removable hard disks did not use the Bernoulli technology.

<text>A ganglion cyst is a fluid-filled bump associated with a joint or tendon sheath. It most often occurs at the back of the wrist, followed by the front of the wrist.
The cause is unknown. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve an outpouching of the synovial membrane. Diagnosis is typically based on examination. The ability to shine through the bump or any past decrease in size supports the diagnosis of the bump as a ganglion cyst. Ganglion cysts are usually obvious upon observation. Medical imaging may be considered on infrequent occasions to rule out another diagnosis.
Treatment is not necessary. Options for treatment include needle aspiration or surgery. About half the time, they resolve on their own. About three per 10,000 people newly develop ganglion of the wrist or hand a year.

==Presentation==
The average size of these cysts is , but excised cysts of more than have been reported. The size of the cyst may vary over time. Between 50 and 70% of all masses on the hand and wrist are ganglion cysts.

=== Wrist ===
They commonly are found near the wrist joint, especially at the scapholunate area.

Common wrist ganglions include:
* dorsal wrist ganglion
* volar wrist ganglion
* extensor retinaculum ganglion
* occult ganglion
* intraosseous ganglion
* mucous cyst

=== Foot ===
In a 2007 study of patients in Glasgow whose foot lumps were removed surgically, 39 of 101 cases were ganglion cysts. The study replicated earlier findings that no ganglion cysts were found on the sole or heel. The authors wrote, &quot;Although lumps in these areas may be ganglia, the surgeon should probably consider other diagnoses in the first instance.&quot; The researchers noted a preponderance of occurrence among females (85%) and that 11 of the other cases had been misdiagnosed as ganglion cysts before surgery.

Ganglion cysts are not limited to the hands and feet. They may occur near the knee, commonly near the cruciate ligaments, but they may occur at the origins of the gastrocnemius tendon, and anteriorly on Hoffa&#x27;s infrapatellar fat pad. At the shoulder, they typically occur at the acromioclavicular joint or along the biceps tendon.

=== Other ===
From their common origin at a joint or tendon, ganglion cysts may form in a wide range of locations. Rarely, intraosseous ganglion cysts occur, sometimes in combination with a cyst in the overlying soft tissue. Rare cases of intramuscular ganglion cysts in the gastrocnemius muscle of the calf have been reported. It is possible for a cyst to be considerably displaced from the joint. In one extreme case, a ganglion cyst was observed to propagate extensively via the conduit of the common peroneal nerve sheath to a location in the thigh; in such cases surgery to the proximal joint to remove the articular connection may remove the need for a riskier, more extensive surgery in the neural tissue of the thigh. The cysts may intrude into the spine, which may cause pain and dysesthesia in distant extremities.

Cystic adventitial disease, in which a cyst occurs within the popliteal artery near the knee, has been proposed recently to occur by an articular mechanism, with a conduit leading from the joint, similar to the development of ganglion cysts, that spreads within the peroneal nerve.
One uncommon location of the cysts are in the muscle tendons of the hand, such as the extensor digitorum superficialis.

Cysts that were compressing one or more nerves and causing bone erosions have been reported to occur near the shoulder joint.

==Causes==
The most commonly accepted probable cause of ganglion cysts is the &quot;herniation hypothesis,&quot; by which they are thought to occur as an out-pouching or distention of a weakened portion of a joint capsule or tendon sheath. This description is based on the observations that the cysts occur close to tendons and joints. The microscopic anatomy of the cyst resembles that of tenosynovial tissue. The fluid is similar in composition to synovial fluid. Dye injected into the joint frequently ends up in the cyst. Dye injected into the cyst rarely enters the joint, however, which has been attributed to the apparent formation of an effective and one-way &quot;check valve&quot;, allowing fluid out of the joint, but not back in.

In synovials, post-traumatic degeneration of connective tissue and inflammation have been considered as causes. Other possible mechanisms for the development of ganglion cysts include repeated mechanical stress, facet arthrosis, myxoid degeneration of periarticular fibrous tissues and liquefaction with chronic damage, increased production of hyaluronic acid by fibroblasts, and a proliferation of mesenchymal cells.

==Diagnosis==
Ganglion cysts are diagnosed easily, as they are visible and pliable to touch.

Ultrasonography (US) may be used to increase diagnostic confidence in clinically suspected lesions or to view smaller &quot;&quot; cysts as a cause of dorsal wrist pain with forceful extension.

==Treatment==
At least 33% resolve without treatment within six years, and 50% within 10 years.

Surgical excision is the primary discretionary, elective treatment option for ganglion cysts. Alternatively, a hypodermic needle may be used to drain the fluid from the cyst (via aspiration). The recurrence rate is about 50% following aspiration of a ganglion cyst.

===Complications===
Complications of treatment may include joint stiffness and scar formation. Recurrence of the lesion is more common following excision of a volar ganglion cyst in the wrist. Incomplete excision that fails to include the stalk or pedicle also may lead to recurrence, as will failing to execute a layered closure of the incision.

==Prognosis==
Recurrence rate is higher in aspirated cysts than in excised ones. Ganglion cysts have been found to recur following surgery in 12% to 41% of patients.

A six-year outcome study of the treatment of ganglion cysts on the dorsal wrist compared excision, aspiration, and no treatment. Neither excision nor aspiration provided long-term benefit better than no treatment. Of the untreated ganglion cysts, 58% resolved spontaneously; the postsurgery recurrence rate in this study was 39%. A similar study in 2003 of ganglion cysts occurring on the palmar surface of the wrist states: &quot;At 2- and 5-year follow-up, regardless of treatment, no difference in symptoms was found, regardless of whether the palmar wrist ganglion was excised, aspirated, or left alone.&quot;

==Etymology==
Being a misnomer that has persisted into modern times, the ganglion cyst is unrelated to the neural ganglion or ganglion cell; traces back to the ancient Greek , a &#x27;knot&#x27; or &#x27;swelling beneath the skin&#x27;, which extends to the neural masses by analogy. Generally, Hippocrates is credited with the description of these cysts.

== &quot;Bible bump&quot; ==
A historical method of treatment for a ganglion cyst was to strike the lump with a large, heavy book, causing the cyst to rupture and drain into the surrounding tissues. Historically, a Bible, usually the largest (or only) book in a household, was employed for this treatment. This practice led to the nickname of &quot;Bible bumps&quot; or &quot;Gideon&#x27;s disease&quot; for the cysts. This treatment risks injuring the person and thus is not recommended.

<text>The West Australian Football League (WAFL &quot;waffle&quot; or &quot;W-A-F-L&quot;) is an Australian rules football league based in Perth, in Western Australia. The league currently consists of ten teams, which play each other in a 20-round season usually lasting from April to September, with the top five teams playing off in a finals series, culminating in a Grand Final. The league also runs reserves, colts (under-19) and women&#x27;s competitions.

The WAFL was founded in 1885 as the West Australian Football Association (WAFA), and has undergone a variety of name changes since then, re-adopting its current name in 2001. For most of its existence, the league was considered one of the traditional &quot;big three&quot; Australian rules football leagues, along with the Victorian Football League and South Australian National Football League. However, since the introduction of two Western Australia-based clubs into the Victorian Football League (later renamed the Australian Football League) – the West Coast Eagles in 1987 and the Fremantle Dockers in 1995 – the popularity and standard of the league has decreased to the point where it is considered a feeder competition to the Australian Football League.

Although payments are made to players, it is generally considered to be a semi-professional competition, with a salary cap of A$245,000 per club. The league is currently affiliated with the two Western Australia-based AFL clubs. The competition is governed by the West Australian Football Commission.

== Clubs ==
The West Australian Football League operates on a single table system, with no divisions, conferences nor promotion and relegation from other leagues.

===Former clubs===
Eleven other clubs formerly competed in the competition:
: Claremont known as Claremont-Cottesloe from 1926 to 1934.
: Fremantle Football Club (II) was known as Unions Football Club from 1886 to 1889.
: Peel have been aligned with Fremantle since 2014.
: Perth was known as Victoria Park from 1934 to 1935.
: Up until the turn of the century, there were a limited number of grounds available for use by the clubs, with all clubs sharing the different grounds. As such, the Esplanade Park, Fremantle and Fremantle Park in Fremantle, and the Old Recreation Ground (Wellington Square) and the New Recreation Ground (Esplanade Reserve) in Perth were all used as &quot;home&quot; grounds by the above teams.
: Rovers were a &quot;wandering&quot; team – they had no home ground and had drawn players from all over the metropolitan area.
: West Australian (1887–88) merged with Victorians (1885–88) in 1889 to form the Metropolitan Football Club (1889–90), which in turn became the West Perth Football Club in 1891

===Competition timeline===
==Venues==

==Salary cap==
Although players are paid, the WAFL is considered a semi-professional competition with a salary cap in place and Total Player Payments (TPP) equating to around $245,000. This is the third highest Australian rules football salary cap after the AFL and SANFL. Each WAFL club has 2 squads of 22 players. In 2023, this equates to approximately $5,000AUD on average for a player per season, however some players may be paid much more than this. 

==Audience==

===Media===

====Television====

In 2022, the WAFL signed a deal that will see 26 games including all finals matches broadcast on the Seven Network, with the remaining 72 matches to be available for streaming on the AFL&#x27;s official app and AFL On Demand service.

Previously in January 2015, the WAFL announced a deal struck with the Seven Network, where under the arrangement, Seven agreed to a three-year deal involving the telecast of 18 home and away matches as well as all Finals matches, broadcast throughout Western Australia. Before this, the WAFL match of the round was broadcast on ABC throughout Western Australia every Saturday afternoon during the regular home and away season. Matches were replayed nationwide on-demand from the ABC iView service and re-broadcast on the ABC2 channel early Friday morning at 2.30 am local time.

====Radio====
Radio stations which cover the competition include ABC Radio Perth, ABC Radio Grandstand Digital, 91.3 SportFM, 107.3 HFM and KIX Country Digital.

===Sponsorship===
Since the 2025 season, the WAFL has been sponsored by WA based logistics service provider Sullivan Logistics, who signed a four year deal to be naming rights sponsor of the competition. This ended a three year period where there no naming rights sponsor which were previously held by Optus (2019–2021), And before that McDonald&#x27;s (2015–2018) and earlier still AAMI (2010–2014).

===Attendance===
Attendance at WAFL matches dropped when each of the two Western Australian based AFL teams entered the league. In recent years, however the attendances have increased slightly, with 2009 recording the first combined annual attendance of more than 200,000 since 1994.

The largest recent crowd was 29,879 at the 2021 WAFL Grand Final between Subiaco and South Fremantle at Optus Stadium. The all-time attendance record is 52,781 in 1979 for East Fremantle v South Fremantle at Subiaco Oval.

== History ==
===Pre–1900: Formation and early years===
Organised football in the Perth/Fremantle region of Western Australia dates back to 1881. Back then though rugby union was the dominant football code, with only one senior club, &quot;Unions&quot;, playing Australian Rules.

In 1883 a second club, &quot;Swans&quot;, emerged, but Australian Rules&#x27; growth remained much subdued compared to that of Victoria and South Australia.

However, in those days many young men of Perth&#x27;s wealthier families were educated in Adelaide, the capital of South Australia.

On returning home from there they naturally wished to play the sport they&#x27;d grown up with and no doubt exerted some influence on their less affluent peers as to such. Coincidentally, the press at the time reported there was a growing dissatisfaction with rugby as a spectacle.

During the 1880s, the discoveries of gold, firstly in the Kimberley, Pilbara and Murchison regions, led to a dramatic increase in WA&#x27;s population, including many players and supporters of Australian Rules from the eastern colonies.

In 1885 one of the leading rugby clubs, Fremantle, decided to change to Australian Rules. It was quickly joined by three other clubs – &quot;Rovers&quot;, &quot;Victorians&quot;, and a team of schoolboys from Perth High. The schoolboy side lasted just two matches, but the three other sides went on to contest what in retrospect was viewed as the first-ever official Western Australian Football Association (WAFA) premiership, won by Rovers. And virtually overnight Australian Rules football became the dominant code for the spectator as well.

However progress of Australian rules in Western Australia still lagged behind the big football cities of Melbourne, Adelaide and Geelong and is evidenced by the unstable nature of the clubs that participated in the early years.

In 1886 a new club Fremantle-based club Unions joined.

In 1887 Fremantle left the WAFA and the West Australian Football Club joined but they would only play two seasons before they disappeared.

In 1890 Unions would rename themselves Fremantle as those involved in the game saw the need to identify themselves with the region they were located in.

1891 saw two new clubs arrive, Centrals and East Perth, but they would be gone after one season and two seasons respectively.

1898 saw the entry of East Fremantle to the league.

1899 would be the last season Fremantle would take part. Despite Unions/Fremantle being the most dominant club in the WAFA up to this point winning the competition 10 times in its 13 years of existence, problems with debt saw the club disappear and some people involved with the old entity formed South Fremantle Football Club in its place. Despite the fact that many involved with Fremantle moved onto South Fremantle the new club is not seen as a continuation of the old and did not lay claim to its proud records to that date.

1899 was also the last time Rovers would take part. The move to regionalisation which saw Unions take on the old Fremantle&#x27;s name and colours made it difficult for this club that didn&#x27;t represent a particular area to attract players. They folded and were immediately replaced by Perth Football Club who were promoted from the Perth First Rate Association.

===Early 1900s===
Major gold discoveries at Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie in 1892, coupled with a major international economic depression, caused immigration from the eastern colonies to accelerate not only to the Goldfields but also onto Perth. These migrants came from a climate where Australian Rules football was more popular and included a large number of footballers including some celebrated players.

The Goldfields competition (later known as the Goldfields Football League) was hence comparable in status and standard to the Perth competition for many years. (This was shown by the fact that it had a separate seat on the Australian National Football Council until 1919.)

The higher standard of play that followed helped to increase the game&#x27;s popularity and increased the professionalism of the WAFA which in turn saw a more stable look come to the league which to this point saw teams frequently coming and going, not to mention problems with frequent crowd violence.

By 1901, the WAFA had grown to have six teams. Up to this point, five sides at most had been in the competition, and this number had invariably changed from year to year, as clubs came and went. And by 1906 there were eight teams: West Perth, East Perth, East Fremantle, South Fremantle, North Fremantle, Subiaco, Perth and Midland Junction.

Recent arrivals East Fremantle became the dominant force in the league winning 11 premierships from 1900 to 1918.

On 27 March 1907, the WAFA was renamed the West Australian Football League (WAFL).

The West Australian State Premiership was awarded to the winner of a contest played between the GNFL premiers and the WAFL premiers. The contest was played intermittently between 1903 and 1924 and the winning team accorded the title &quot;Champions of Western Australia&quot;.

Unlike many other sporting competitions, the WAFL didn&#x27;t go into recess during World War I, although two teams – North Fremantle and Midland Junction – were &quot;casualties&quot; of the war, competing for the last time in 1915 and 1917 respectively.

===Between the wars===
1919 saw East Perth win their first premiership, and they would go on to win 5 in a row.

In 1921, the WAFL followed the idea of the SANFL&#x27;s Magarey Medal and introduced the Sandover Medal, for the fairest and best player over a season, as voted by the field umpires. The medal has been awarded annually ever since.

Claremont/Cottesloe entered the league in 1926, bringing the number of teams back to seven. They would rename the club to simply Claremont a few years later.

On Wednesday 12 October 1927, the WAFL was renamed the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL) – the &quot;national&quot; concept in the name being adopted by the SANFL, TANFL and other leagues when the Australian Football Council became the Australian National Football Council earlier in the year.

Swan Districts entered the league in 1934. The eight competing sides at this point still remain today and are often referred to as the &quot;traditional eight clubs&quot; as opposed to Peel who would join much later on.

Because of World War II, the league only ran an &quot;under age&quot; competition between 1942 and 1944. However, the three premierships won during this time are given equal status to any other, in official records (East Perth however do not give their 1944 premiership win equal status). All clubs competed, with the exception of Swan Districts who could not form a team in 1942, although they were back in 1943. The Sandover Medal was also presented each year.

===Post-war===

Western Australian football was particularly strong during the years immediately following World War II. The state side enjoyed unparalleled success, downing Victoria in each of the first three post war meetings as well as enjoying the better of their encounters with South Australia.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, there were several attempts at expansion of the league. WANFL secretary Billy Orr supported the admission of teams from Inglewood and South Perth. In 1951 the league established a separate recruiting district in Inglewood in anticipation of a new club being established at Inglewood Oval. The Inglewood Football Club was established in 1953, with support from three local amateur clubs and former East Perth player Herbie Screaigh. In the same year it applied for admission to the WANFL reserves competition from the following season. However, by 1954 the league had instead announced that it would expand East Perth&#x27;s zone to include the Inglewood district.

In 1952, the Avon Valley Football Association applied to enter a team in the WANFL, following concerns about its players being poached by Perth-based teams. It would have been based at Northam&#x27;s Jubilee Oval. The proposal was raised again in 1954 but did not proceed.

South Fremantle were without dispute one of the strongest teams in Australia during much of the period 1947 to 1954, not only winning 6 premierships but also defeating many touring sides from Victoria and South Australia.

From 1956 to 1961 it would be East Perth&#x27;s turn to dominate the WAFL with them featuring in all 6 Grand Finals of this period and coming out with 3 victories. Their team featured Graham Farmer who would leave at the end of the &#x27;61 season and carve out a reputation in the VFL as one of the game&#x27;s greatest ever players.

The 1960s saw crowds get bigger and bigger, as WAFL football captured the hearts and minds of the WA public like never before, and in the 1970s and early 1980s it was easily the biggest show in town.

However, during this period more and more star WAFL players were looking to head to the Victorian Football League (VFL), enticed by the bigger money and the fact that it was more and more gaining a reputation as the &quot;big&quot; league.

This is perhaps best evidenced in that Victoria (i.e. the VFL representative team) had by far the best record in interstate games for a long time. But in 1977, when the first proper State of Origin match was played, it saw Western Australia inflict its biggest defeat on a Victorian team.

East Perth&#x27;s 1961 loss to Swan Districts would see that side&#x27;s first-ever premiership. Captain/coached by Haydn Bunton, Jr., they became the team of the early 1960s when they followed it up in 1962 and 1963 to make it three in a row.

The dominating sides of the late 1960s and early 1970s were the three Perth teams. Perth won 3 in a row from 1966 to 1968, and West Perth won in 1969 and 1971 captain/coached by Graham Farmer who had returned from over east. All 5 of these grand final wins came at the expense of East Perth who earned the bridesmaid tag in this era. However East Perth finally won through in the 1972 grand final.

After 1972 the competition was more evenly matched with every team winning a grand final over the next 10 years.

At this time crowds were as big as they ever were. The 1979 grand final was played before a record crowd of 52,781 and saw East Fremantle defeat archrivals South Fremantle.

===1980s===
In 1980, the WANFL dropped the &quot;N&quot; and the &quot;ern&quot; and reverted to being called the WAFL.

At the end of the 1980 season East Perth put in an application to join the VFL. The offer was withdrawn.

Crowds had been buoyed by State of Origin football that saw Western Australia&#x27;s best players return home briefly, but this effect was short lived. Interest in the WAFL began a slow decline, as it became increasingly obvious that even larger numbers of the WAFL&#x27;s best players were going to head east.

By 1983 the management of the WAFL itself acknowledged that economic crisis loomed. They approached the state government for financial aid, and were rewarded with a grant of $1.9 million. In response, the government wanted a full-scale investigation into the likely future financial demands of football.

This led to the formation of the West Australian Football Commission who functioned independently of the WAFL.

In 1986 the decision had been made that the WAFL needed to become involved in helping the VFL, where several clubs were also struggling financially, to become national.

Against a backdrop in which several WAFL clubs were looking to enter the VFL or in which a struggling Victorian club may be relocated to Perth, the WAFL decided to hastily form a new club to enter the VFL such that they could retain control of a West Australian presence in the situation.

Meanwhile, in the league Swan Districts won another hat-trick of premierships from 1982 to 1984. East Fremantle, the WAFL&#x27;s most successful club, won the centenary premiership in 1985 and in 1986 Subiaco had the honour to be the last club to win the premiership prior to Western Australia&#x27;s participation in the national league.

===Effect of VFL expansion and the AFL===

The West Coast Eagles were formed and competed in the VFL for the first time in 1987 (the VFL was renamed the AFL in 1990).

With many of Western Australia&#x27;s best players now competing in a team that represented Western Australia on a national scale, it was suddenly apparent that the WAFL was not the prime focus of the football public as crowds and media attention centred on the &#x27;national&#x27; league.

In 1990 the league was renamed the Western Australian State Football League, but it had reverted to WAFL by 1991.

Another locally based AFL team, the Fremantle Football Club were formed in 1994, and this cemented the position of WAFL as a second-class competition. (Indeed, the 1991 introduction of the Adelaide Crows to the VFL/AFL meant that the SANFL was experiencing a similar decline to the WAFL.)

WAFL clubs have struggled ever since with their sudden demise from being technically equal to any VFL club, to feeder club status. However, they have enjoyed some benefits, such as the funds flowing from the WA-based AFL teams and the influx of talented players from other states, attempting to make a name for themselves.

In 1997, Peel Thunder – somewhat controversially – became the ninth WAFL club. Throughout their brief history, they struggled to compete with the traditional eight clubs, which were generally opposed to their presence. This was partly because having an odd number of teams forced one team to have a bye each week.

Also in 1997, the WAFL was renamed Westar Rules, in an attempt to revamp the league&#x27;s image. The name again reverted to WAFL in 2001 although retained the logo.

Recent years have seen the WAFL stabilise itself as a league a step down from the AFL. Having the best football players all playing in the AFL has lessened the standard of play; however this has recovered somewhat, with retired or delisted AFL players returning and young players coming through. It is becoming fairly common, however, for young players to be drafted as 17- or 18-year-olds directly to the AFL and not play in the WAFL football for more than a few games.

Attendances have recovered slightly and in 2004, the league posted a total attendance of 202,797. The total attendance, including AFL games was a record 1,030,000.

In 2019 the WAFL expanded to a 10-club competition, with the introduction of West Coast Eagles Reserves.

===Future===
While the WAFL has not been as keen as the SANFL to include teams from other states, there have been proposals to include teams from regions unwanted by the AFL, and even to serve as a second-tier national league.

The most pushed for expansion team was to be from Darwin, Northern Territory, formed as a representative club of the Northern Territory Football League, however the NT team opted to join the Queensland Australian Football League for the 2009 season, and moved to the newly created North East Australian Football League in 2011 after the top divisions of the Queensland AFL and AFL Canberra merged. 

In 2019, the WAFL partnered with the West Australian Women&#x27;s Football League to create a new women&#x27;s state league, the WAFL Women&#x27;s. The league is run adjacent to the WAFL premiership.

<doc id="337381" wikidata="Q15137935" url="?curid=337381" title="Greenwich Hospital, London">
<text>Greenwich Hospital was a permanent home for retired sailors of the Royal Navy, which operated from 1692 to 1869. Its buildings, initially Greenwich Palace, in Greenwich, London, were later used by the Royal Naval College, Greenwich and the University of Greenwich, and are now known as the Old Royal Naval College. The word &quot;hospital&quot; was used in its original sense of a place providing hospitality for those in need of it, and did not refer to medical care, although the buildings included an infirmary which, after Greenwich Hospital closed, operated as Dreadnought Seaman&#x27;s Hospital until 1986.

The foundation which operated the hospital still exists, for the benefit of former Royal Navy personnel and their dependants. It now provides sheltered housing on other sites.

==History==
The hospital was created as the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich on the instructions of Queen Mary II, who had been inspired by the sight of wounded sailors returning from the Battle of La Hogue in 1692. She ordered the King Charles wing of the palace—originally designed by architect John Webb for King Charles II in 1664—to be remodelled as a naval hospital to provide a counterpart for the Chelsea Hospital for soldiers. Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor gave their services free of charge as architects of the new Royal Hospital. Sir John Vanbrugh succeeded Wren as architect, completing the complex to Wren&#x27;s original plans.

An early controversy arose when it emerged that the original plans for the hospital would have blocked the riverside view from the Queen&#x27;s House. Queen Mary II therefore ordered that the buildings be split, providing an avenue leading from the river through the hospital grounds up to the Queen&#x27;s House and Greenwich Hill beyond. This gave the hospital its distinctive look, with its buildings arranged in a number of quadrants. Its four main buildings (the &quot;Courts&quot;) are bisected north–south by a Grand Square and processional route, and east–west by an internal road from the East Gate (and gate-house) to the West Gate (and gate-house) by Greenwich Market in Greenwich town centre. The Grand Square and processional route running north–south maintained access to, and a river view from, the Queen&#x27;s House and Greenwich Park beyond.


Construction was financed through an endowment, financed through the transfer of £19,500 in fines paid by merchants convicted of smuggling in 1695, a public fundraising appeal which brought in £9,000, and a £2,000 annual contribution from Treasury. Parliament passed the Greenwich Hospital, etc. Act 1695 (7 &amp; 8 Will. 3. c. 21), long titled &quot;An Act for the Increase and Encouragement of Seamen&quot;, which established the basic rules of use and benefits for seamen, and amended it the following year by the Greenwich Hospital, etc. Act 1696 (8 &amp; 9 Will. 3. c. 23). In 1705 an additional £6,472 was paid into the fund, comprising the liquidated value of estates belonging to the recently hanged pirate Captain William Kidd.

The first of the principal buildings constructed was the King Charles Court (the oldest part dating back to the restoration), completed in March 1705.

The other principal buildings constructed included:
*Queen Mary Court (planned by Wren and Hawksmoor, but not built until after Wren&#x27;s death, by Thomas Ripley), completed in 1742, 
*Queen Anne Court (architects: Wren and Hawksmoor)
*King William Court (designed by Wren, but completed by Hawksmoor and Sir John Vanbrugh)
Queen Mary Court houses the hospital&#x27;s chapel (designed by Wren but not completed until 1742). Its present appearance dates from 1779 to 1789, when it was rebuilt to a design by James &quot;Athenian&quot; Stuart after a devastating fire. The ornate plasterwork was created by John Papworth. 

King William Court is famous for its baroque Painted Hall, which was painted by Sir James Thornhill in honour of King William III and Queen Mary II (the ceiling of the Lower Hall), of Queen Anne and her husband, Prince George of Denmark (the ceiling of the Upper Hall) and George I (the north wall of the Upper Hall). The Painted Hall was deemed too magnificent for the pensioned seamen&#x27;s refectory and was never regularly used as such. It became a tourist destination, opened for viewing. On 5 January 1806, Lord Nelson&#x27;s body lay in state in the Painted Hall of the Greenwich Hospital before being taken up the river Thames to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral for a state funeral. Nelson&#x27;s Pediment in the William Courtyard was sculpted in Coade stone in 1813 as a public memorial, and was regarded by the Coade workers as the finest of all their work. In 1824 a National Gallery of Naval Art was created in the Painted Hall, where it remained until 1936, when the collection was transferred to the National Maritime Museum, newly established in the Queen&#x27;s House and adjacent buildings.
On the riverside front of the north-east corner of King Charles Court is an obelisk, designed by Philip Hardwick and unveiled in 1855, erected in memory of the Arctic explorer Joseph René Bellot, who died in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue the members of John Franklin&#x27;s ill-fated expedition to open a Northwest Passage in northern Canada.

The first governor, Sir William Gifford, took up office in 1708. In 1774, the then Lieutenant Governor, Captain Thomas Baillie made allegations of mismanagement of the hospital&#x27;s affairs, which led to a celebrated court case.

A Royal Hospital School opened on the site in 1712 to provide assistance and education to the orphans of seafarers in the Royal and Merchant Navies. In the 1820, the school incorporated the Royal Naval Asylum. In 1933 it moved to Holbrook, Suffolk (where it remains today); the old school buildings were reopened the following year as the National Maritime Museum.

The Greenwich Hospital buildings included an infirmary, constructed in the 1760s to a design also by James Stuart, where pensioners were attended by trained medical staff (Sir John Liddell was for a time senior medical officer). After some adaptation and rebuilding this became the Dreadnought Seamen&#x27;s Hospital in 1870 (taking its name from a hospital ship moored off Greenwich). The treatment for tropical diseases moved in 1919 to the Seamen&#x27;s Hospital Society hospital near Euston Square, in central London, to form the Hospital for Tropical Diseases. The Dreadnought Seaman&#x27;s Hospital closed in 1986, with special services for seamen and their families then provided by the Dreadnought Unit at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital in Lambeth.

Greenwich Hospital closed in 1869, with the buildings being taken over by the Royal Naval College, Greenwich in 1873.

Due to railway construction, the remains of thousands of sailors and officers, including many of those who had fought in the Battle of Trafalgar, were removed from the hospital site in 1875 and reinterred in East Greenwich Pleasaunce also called Pleasaunce Park (named after the former Palace of Placentia which had been on the site of the hospital).

==Governors==
Governors included:
* Vice-Admiral Thomas Hopsonn (1704–1708)
* Captain Sir William Gifford (1708–1714)
* Vice-Admiral Lord Aylmer (1714–1720)
* Admiral Sir John Jennings (1720–1743)

* Admiral Sir Houston Stewart (1869–1872)
* Admiral Sir Sydney Dacres (1872–1884)
* Admiral Sir Lewis Jones (1884–1895)

==Greenwich Hospital: the charity==
The charitable foundation of Greenwich Hospital still exists, although it is no longer based at the original site. It is now a Crown Charity for the benefit of seafarers and their dependants, with the Secretary of State for Defence acting as The Crown&#x27;s sole trustee. The charity now funds sheltered housing for former Royal Navy personnel and the school the hospital spawned, the Royal Hospital School, now at Holbrook in Suffolk. The charity&#x27;s head office is located in the City of London.

The charity derives some of its funds from properties in and around the hospital site. The core hospital buildings are let on a 150-year lease to the University of Greenwich and Trinity Laban College of Music. Greenwich Promenade is let to the Port of London Authority, while retail and residential properties in central Greenwich, including Greenwich Market, form the charity&#x27;s core investment portfolio.

In August 2020, several market traders warned they might have to cease trading after Greenwich Hospital&#x27;s managing agent Knight Frank informed them of steep rent increases during the COVID-19 pandemic. After complaints, it was reported in September 2020 that the rent hikes would be reversed.

<doc id="337386" wikidata="Q4184222" url="?curid=337386" title="Foreign-language influences in English">
<text>The English language descends from Old English, the West Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons. Most of its grammar, its core vocabulary and the most common words are Germanic. However, the percentage of loans in everyday conversation varies by dialect and idiolect, even if English vocabulary at large has a greater Romance influence.

Many loanwords have entered into English from other languages. English borrowed many words from Old Norse, the North Germanic language of the Vikings, and later from Norman French, the Romance language of the Normans, which descends from Latin. Estimates of native words derived from Old English range up to 33%, with the rest made up of outside borrowings. These are mostly from Norman/French, but many others were later borrowed directly from Latin or Greek. Some of the Romance words borrowed into English were themselves loanwords from other languages, such as the Germanic Frankish language.

==Loanwords ==
A computerized survey of about 80,000 words in the third edition of the &quot;Shorter Oxford Dictionary&quot;, published by Finkenstaedt and Wolff in 1973 estimated the origin of English words to be as follows:
* French: 28.30%;
* Latin, including modern scientific and technical Latin: 28.24%;
* Germanic languages, as inherited from Old English, from Proto-Germanic, or a more recent borrowing from a Germanic language such as Old Norse, excluding Germanic words borrowed from a Romance language: 25%;
* Greek: 5.32%;
* no etymology given: 4.04%;
* derived from proper names: 3.28%; and
* all other languages: less than 1%.

A 1975 survey of 10,000 words taken from several thousand business letters by Joseph M. Williams suggested this set of statistics:

* French (langue d&#x27;oïl): 41%;
* &quot;Native&quot; English (derived from Old English): 33%;
* Latin: 15%; 
* Old Norse: 5%;
* Dutch: 1%; and
* Other: 5%.

However, he found considerable discrepancy between the most common and least common words. The top thousand words were 83% of English origin, while the least common were only 25% of English origin.

However, due to the variability of vocabulary of individuals, dialects, and time periods, exact percentages cannot be taken at face value.

==Languages influencing the English language==

Here is a list of the most common foreign language influences in English, where other languages have influenced or contributed words to English.

===Celtic===

Celtic words are almost absent but do exist, such as the word galore which came about in the 17th century and stems from the Irish, &quot;go leor&quot; which means plenty, or to sufficiency. There are also dialectal words, such as the Yan Tan Tethera system of counting sheep. However, hypotheses have been made that English syntax was influenced by Celtic languages, such as the system of continuous tenses was a calque of similar Celtic phrasal structures. This is controversial, as the system has clear native English and other Germanic developments.

===French===

The French contributed legal, military, technological, and political terminology. French was the prestige language during the Norman occupation of the British Isles, causing many French words to enter English vocabulary. Their language also contributed common words, such as how food was prepared: &quot;boil&quot;, &quot;broil&quot;, &quot;fry&quot;, &quot;roast&quot;, and &quot;stew&quot;, as well as words related to the nobility: &quot;prince&quot;, &quot;duke&quot;, &quot;marquess&quot;, &quot;viscount&quot;, &quot;baron&quot;, and their feminine equivalents. Nearly 30 percent of English words (in an 80,000-word dictionary) are of French origin.

===Latin===

Most words in English that are derived from Latin are scientific and technical words, medical terminology, academic terminology, and legal terminology.

===Greek===

English words derived from Greek include scientific and medical terminology (for instance s and ), Christian theological terminology.

===Norman===
&quot;Castle&quot;, &quot;cauldron&quot;, &quot;kennel&quot;, &quot;catch&quot;, &quot;cater&quot; are among Norman words introduced into English. The Norman language also introduced (or reinforced) words of Norse origin such as &quot;mug&quot;.

===Dutch===

There are many ways through which Dutch words have entered the English language: via trade and navigation, such as &quot;&quot; (from ), &quot;freebooter&quot; (from ), &quot;keelhauling&quot; (from ); via painting, such as &quot;landscape&quot; (from ), &quot;easel&quot; (from ), &quot;still life&quot; (from ); warfare, such as &quot;forlorn hope&quot; (from )&quot;, &quot;beleaguer (from ), &quot;to bicker&quot; (from ); via civil engineering, such as &quot;dam&quot;, &quot;polder&quot;, &quot;dune&quot; (from ); via the New Netherland settlements in North America, such as &quot;cookie&quot; (from ), &quot;&quot; from , &quot;Santa Claus&quot; (from &quot;Sinterklaas&quot;); via Dutch/Afrikaans speakers with English speakers in South Africa, such as &quot;wildebeest&quot;, &quot;apartheid&quot;, &quot;boer&quot;; via French words of Dutch/Flemish origin that have subsequently been adopted into English, such as &quot;boulevard&quot; (from ), &quot;mannequin&quot; (from ), &quot;buoy&quot; (from ).

===Spanish===

Words from Iberian Romance languages (&quot;aficionado&quot;, &quot;albino&quot;, &quot;alligator&quot;, &quot;cargo&quot;, &quot;cigar&quot;, &quot;embargo&quot;, &quot;guitar&quot;, &quot;jade&quot;, &quot;mesa&quot;, &quot;paella&quot;, &quot;platinum&quot;, &quot;plaza&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;rodeo&quot;, &quot;salsa&quot;, &quot;savvy&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;siesta&quot;, &quot;tilde&quot;, &quot;tornado&quot;, &quot;vanilla&quot; etc.). Words relating to warfare and tactics, for instance &quot;flotilla&quot;, and &quot;guerrilla&quot;; or related to science and culture. 

===Italian===

There are many Italian words used in the English language relating to music such as piano, &quot;fortissimo,&quot; and &quot;legato&quot;, and Italian culture and politics, such as &quot;piazza&quot;, &quot;pizza&quot;, &quot;gondola&quot;, &quot;balcony&quot;, &quot;fascism&quot;. The English word &quot;umbrella&quot; comes from Italian .

===Turkic Languages===

English contains many Turkish loanwords, which are still part of the modern vernacular, including &quot;bosh&quot;, balkan, &quot;bugger&quot;, sofa, coffee, &quot;doodle&quot;, &quot;Hungary&quot;, &quot;lackey&quot;, &quot;mammoth&quot;, q&quot;uiver&quot;, yogurt, and yataghan.

===South Asian languages===
English contains words relating to culture originating from the colonial era in India, e.g., &quot;atoll&quot;, &quot;avatar&quot;, &quot;bandana&quot;, &quot;bangles&quot;, &quot;buddy&quot;, &quot;bungalow&quot;, &quot;calico&quot;, &quot;candy&quot;, &quot;cashmere&quot;, &quot;chit&quot;, &quot;cot&quot;, &quot;curry&quot;, &quot;cushy&quot;, &quot;dinghy&quot;, &quot;guru&quot;, &quot;juggernaut&quot;, &quot;jungle&quot;, &quot;karma&quot;, &quot;khaki&quot;, &quot;lacquer&quot;, &quot;lilac&quot;, &quot;loot&quot;, &quot;mandarin&quot;, &quot;mantra&quot;, &quot;polo&quot;, &quot;pyjamas&quot;, &quot;shampoo&quot;, &quot;thug&quot;, &quot;tiffin&quot;, and &quot;veranda&quot;.

===German===

English is a Germanic language. As a result, many words are distantly related to German. Most German words relating to World War I and World War II found their way into the English language, words such as &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;, &quot;Anschluss&quot;, &quot;Führer&quot;, and &quot;Lebensraum&quot;; food terms, such as &quot;bratwurst&quot;, &quot;hamburger&quot; and &quot;frankfurter&quot;; words related to psychology and philosophy, such as &quot;gestalt&quot;, &quot;Übermensch&quot;, &quot;zeitgeist&quot;, and &quot;realpolitik&quot;. From German origin are also: &quot;wanderlust&quot;, &quot;schadenfreude&quot;, &quot;kaputt&quot;, &quot;kindergarten&quot;, &quot;autobahn&quot;, &quot;rucksack&quot;.

===Old Norse===

Words of Old Norse origin have entered English primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and northern England between the mid 9th to the 11th centuries (see also Danelaw). Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as &quot;they&quot;, &quot;egg&quot;, &quot;sky&quot; or &quot;knife&quot;.

===Hebrew and Yiddish===
Words used in religious contexts, like Sabbath, kosher, hallelujah, amen, and jubilee or words that have become slang like &quot;schmuck&quot;, &quot;shmooze&quot;, &quot;nosh&quot;, &quot;oy vey&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

=== Frankish ===

Words such as warden and guardian are hypothesized to come from a proto-Romance loan from Frankish &quot;*wardōn&quot; &#x27;to direct one&#x27;s gaze&#x27;.

===Arabic===

Trade items such as &quot;borax&quot;, &quot;coffee&quot;, &quot;cotton&quot;, &quot;hashish&quot;, &quot;henna&quot;, &quot;mohair&quot;, &quot;muslin&quot;, &quot;saffron&quot;; Islamic religious terms such as &quot;jihad&quot;, &quot;Assassin&quot;, &quot;hadith&quot;, and &quot;sharia&quot;; scientific vocabulary borrowed into Latin in the 12th and 13th centuries (&quot;alcohol&quot;, &quot;alkali&quot;, &quot;algebra&quot;, &quot;azimuth&quot;, &quot;zenith, cipher&quot;, &quot;nadir&quot;); plants or plant products originating in tropical Asia and introduced to medieval Europe through Arabic intermediation (&quot;camphor&quot;, &quot;jasmine&quot;, &quot;lacquer&quot;, &quot;lemon&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;sugar&quot;); Middle Eastern and Maghrebi cuisine words (&quot;couscous&quot;, &quot;falafel&quot;, &quot;hummus&quot;, &quot;kebab&quot;, &quot;tahini&quot;).

==Counting==
Cardinal numbering in English follows two models, Germanic and Italic. The basic numbers are zero through ten. The numbers eleven through nineteen follow native Germanic style, as do twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, and ninety.

Standard English, especially in very conservative formal contexts, continued to use native Germanic style as late as World War I for intermediate numbers greater than 20, viz., &quot;one-and-twenty,&quot; &quot;five-and-thirty,&quot; &quot;seven-and-ninety,&quot; and so on. But with the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the Latin tradition of counting as &quot;twenty-one,&quot; &quot;thirty-five,&quot; &quot;ninety-seven,&quot; etc., which is easier to say and was already common in non-standard regional dialects, gradually replaced the traditional Germanic style to become the dominant style by the end of nineteenth century.

== Opposition ==
Linguistic purism in the English language is the belief that words of native origin should be used instead of foreign-derived ones (which are mainly Romance, Latin and Greek). &quot;Native&quot; can mean &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; or it can be widened to include all Germanic words. In its mild form, it merely means using existing native words instead of foreign-derived ones (such as using &quot;begin&quot; instead of &quot;commence&quot;). In its more extreme form, it involves reviving native words that are no longer widely used (such as &quot;ettle&quot; for &quot;intend&quot;) and/or coining new words from Germanic roots (such as word stock for vocabulary). This dates at least to the inkhorn term debate of the 16th and 17th century, where some authors rejected the foreign influence, and has continued to this day, being most prominent in Plain English advocacy to avoid Latinate terms if a simple native alternative exists.

<text>The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a suite of extension specifications by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for securing data exchanged in the Domain Name System (DNS) in Internet Protocol (IP) networks. The protocol provides cryptographic authentication of data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality.

==Overview==
The original design of the Domain Name System did not include any security features. It was conceived only as a scalable distributed system. The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) attempt to add security, while maintaining backward compatibility. of 2004 documents some of the known threats to the DNS, and their solutions in DNSSEC.

DNSSEC was designed to protect applications using DNS from accepting forged or manipulated DNS data, such as that created by DNS cache poisoning. All answers from DNSSEC protected zones are digitally signed. By checking the digital signature, a DNS resolver is able to check if the information is identical (i.e. unmodified and complete) to the information published by the zone owner and served on an authoritative DNS server. While protecting IP addresses is the immediate concern for many users, DNSSEC can protect any data published in the DNS, including text records (TXT) and mail exchange records (MX), and can be used to bootstrap other security systems that publish references to cryptographic certificates stored in the DNS such as Certificate Records (CERT records, ), SSH fingerprints (SSHFP, ), IPSec public keys (IPSECKEY, ), TLS Trust Anchors (TLSA, ), or Encrypted Client Hello (SVCB/HTTPS records for ECH ).

DNSSEC &quot;does not&quot; provide confidentiality of data; in particular, all DNSSEC responses are authenticated but not encrypted. DNSSEC &quot;does not&quot; protect against DoS attacks directly, though it indirectly provides some benefit (because signature checking allows the use of potentially untrustworthy parties).

Other standards (not DNSSEC) are used to secure bulk data (such as a DNS zone transfer) sent between DNS servers. As documented in , some users and developers make false assumptions about DNS names, such as assuming that a company&#x27;s common name plus &quot;.com&quot; is always its domain name. DNSSEC cannot protect against false assumptions; it can only authenticate that the data is truly from or not available from the domain owner.

The DNSSEC specifications (called &quot;DNSSEC-bis&quot;) describe the current DNSSEC protocol in great detail. See , , and . With the publication of these new RFCs (March 2005), an earlier RFC, has become obsolete. The full set of RFCs that specify DNSSEC are collected in , which is also BCP 237.

It is widely believed that securing the DNS is critically important for securing the Internet as a whole, but deployment of DNSSEC specifically has been hampered () by several difficulties:
* The need to design a backward-compatible standard that can scale to the size of the Internet
* Prevention of &quot;zone enumeration&quot; where desired
* Deployment of DNSSEC implementations across a wide variety of DNS servers and resolvers (clients)
* Disagreement among implementers over who should own the top-level domain root keys
* Overcoming the perceived complexity of DNSSEC and DNSSEC deployment

==Operation==
DNSSEC works by digitally signing records for DNS lookup using public-key cryptography. The correct DNSKEY record is authenticated via a chain of trust, starting with a set of verified public keys for the DNS root zone which is the trusted third party. Domain owners generate their own keys, and upload them using their DNS control panel at their domain-name registrar, which in turn pushes the keys via secDNS to the zone operator (e.g., Verisign for .com) who signs and publishes them in DNS.

===Resource records===
DNS is implemented by the use of several resource records. To implement DNSSEC, several new DNS record types were created or adapted to use with DNSSEC:
;RRSIG (resource record signature): Contains the DNSSEC signature for a record set. DNS resolvers verify the signature with a public key, stored in a DNSKEY record.
;DNSKEY: Contains the public key that a DNS resolver uses to verify DNSSEC signatures in RRSIG records.
;DS (delegation signer): Holds the name of a delegated zone. References a DNSKEY record in the sub-delegated zone. The DS record is placed in the parent zone along with the delegating NS records.
;NSEC (next secure record): Contains a link to the next record name in the zone and lists the record types that exist for the record&#x27;s name. DNS resolvers use NSEC records to verify the non-existence of a record name and type as part of DNSSEC validation.
;NSEC3 (next secure record version 3): Contains links to the next record name in the zone (in hashed name sorting order) and lists the record types that exist for the name covered by the hash value in the first label of the NSEC3 record&#x27;s own name. These records can be used by resolvers to verify the non-existence of a record name and type as part of DNSSEC validation. NSEC3 records are similar to NSEC records, but NSEC3 uses cryptographically hashed record names to avoid the enumeration of the record names in a zone.
;NSEC3PARAM (next secure record version 3 parameters): Authoritative DNS servers use this record to calculate and determine which NSEC3 records to include in responses to DNSSEC requests for non-existing names/types.

When DNSSEC is used, each answer to a DNS lookup contains an RRSIG DNS record, in addition to the record type that was requested. The RRSIG record is a digital signature of the answer DNS resource record set. The digital signature is verified by locating the correct public key found in a DNSKEY record. The NSEC and NSEC3 records are used to provide cryptographic evidence of the non-existence of any Resource Record (RR). The DS record is used in the authentication of DNSKEYs in the lookup procedure using the chain of trust. NSEC and NSEC3 records are used for robust resistance against spoofing.

====Algorithms====

DNSSEC was designed to be extensible so that as attacks are discovered against existing algorithms, new ones can be introduced in a backward-compatible fashion as described in . The following table defines, as of June 2019, the security algorithms that are or were most often used:

===The lookup procedure===
From the results of a DNS lookup, a security-aware DNS resolver can determine whether the authoritative name server for the domain being queried supports DNSSEC, whether the answer it receives is secure, and whether there is some sort of error. The lookup procedure is different for recursive name servers such as those of many ISPs, and for stub resolvers such as those included by default in mainstream operating systems. Microsoft Windows uses a stub resolver, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 in particular use a non-validating but DNSSEC-aware stub resolver.

====Recursive name servers====
Using the chain of trust model, a Delegation Signer (DS) record in a parent domain (DNS zone) can be used to verify a DNSKEY record in a subdomain, which can then contain other DS records to verify further subdomains. Say that a recursive resolver such as an ISP name server wants to get the IP addresses (A record and/or AAAA records) of the domain &quot;www.example.com&quot;.

# The process starts when a security-aware resolver sets the &quot;DO&quot; (&quot;DNSSEC OK&quot;) flag bit in a DNS query. Since the DO bit is in the extended flag bits defined by Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS), , all DNSSEC transactions must support EDNS. EDNS support is also needed to allow for the much larger packet sizes that DNSSEC transactions require.
# When the resolver receives an answer via the normal DNS lookup process, it then checks to make sure that the answer is correct. Ideally, the security-aware resolver would start with verifying the DS and DNSKEY records at the DNS root. Then it would use the DS records for the &quot;com&quot; top-level domain found at the root to verify the DNSKEY records in the &quot;com&quot; zone. From there, it would see if there is a DS record for the &quot;example.com&quot; subdomain in the &quot;com&quot; zone, and if there were, it would then use the DS record to verify a DNSKEY record found in the &quot;example.com&quot; zone. Finally, it would verify the RRSIG record found in the answer for the A records for &quot;www.example.com&quot;.

There are several exceptions to the above example.

First, if &quot;example.com&quot; does not support DNSSEC, there will be no RRSIG record in the answer and there will not be a DS record for &quot;example.com&quot; in the &quot;com&quot; zone. If there is a DS record for &quot;example.com&quot;, but no RRSIG record in the reply, something is wrong and maybe a man in the middle attack is going on, stripping the DNSSEC information and modifying the A records. Or, it could be a broken security-oblivious name server along the way that stripped the DO flag bit from the query or the RRSIG record from the answer. Or, it could be a configuration error.

Next, it may be that there is not a domain name named &quot;www.example.com&quot;, in which case instead of returning a RRSIG record in the answer, there will be either an NSEC record or an NSEC3 record. These are &quot;next secure&quot; records that allow the resolver to prove that a domain name does not exist. The NSEC/NSEC3 records have RRSIG records, which can be verified as above.

Finally, it may be that the &quot;example.com&quot; zone implements DNSSEC, but either the &quot;com&quot; zone or the root zone do not, creating an &quot;island of security&quot; which needs to be validated in some other way. , deployment of DNSSEC to root is completed. The .com domain was signed with valid security keys and the secure delegation was added to the root zone on 1 April 2011.

====Stub resolvers====
Stub resolvers are &quot;minimal DNS resolvers that use recursive query mode to offload most of the work of DNS resolution to a recursive name server.&quot; A stub resolver will simply forward a request to a recursive name server, and use the Authenticated Data (AD) bit in the response as a &quot;hint to find out whether the recursive name server was able to validate signatures for all of the data in the Answer and Authority sections of the response.&quot; Microsoft Windows uses a stub resolver, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 in particular use a non-validating but AD-bit-aware stub resolver.

A &quot;validating stub resolver&quot; can also potentially perform its own signature validation by setting the Checking Disabled (CD) bit in its query messages. A validating stub resolver uses the CD bit to perform its own recursive authentication. Using such a validating stub resolver gives the client end-to-end DNS security for domains implementing DNSSEC, even if the Internet service provider or the connection to them is not trusted.

Non-validating stub resolvers must rely on external DNSSEC validation services, such as those controlled by the user&#x27;s Internet service provider or a public recursive name server, and the communication channels between itself and those name servers, using methods such as DNS over TLS.

===Trust anchors and authentication chains===
To be able to prove that a DNS answer is correct, one needs to know at least one key or DS record that is correct from sources other than the DNS. These starting points are known as trust anchors and are typically obtained with the operating system or via some other trusted source. When DNSSEC was originally designed, it was thought that the only trust anchor that would be needed was for the DNS root. The root anchors were first published on 15 July 2010.

An &quot;authentication chain&quot; is a series of linked DS and DNSKEY records, starting with a trust anchor to the authoritative name server for the domain in question. Without a complete authentication chain, an answer to a DNS lookup cannot be securely authenticated.

===Signatures and zone signing===
To limit replay attacks, there are not only the normal DNS TTL values for caching purposes, but additional timestamps in RRSIG records to limit the validity of a signature. Unlike TTL values which are relative to when the records were sent, the timestamps are absolute. This means that all security-aware DNS resolvers must have clocks that are fairly closely in sync, say to within a few minutes.

These timestamps imply that a zone must regularly be re-signed and re-distributed to secondary servers, or the signatures will be rejected by validating resolvers.

===Key management===
DNSSEC involves many different keys, stored both in DNSKEY records, and from other sources to form trust anchors.

In order to allow for replacement keys, a key rollover scheme is required. Typically, this involves first rolling out new keys in new DNSKEY records, in addition to the existing old keys. Then, when it is safe to assume that the time to live values have caused the caching of old keys to have passed, these new keys can be used. Finally, when it is safe to assume that the caching of records using the old keys have expired, the old DNSKEY records can be deleted. This process is more complicated for things such as the keys to trust anchors, such as at the root, which may require an update of the operating system.

Keys in DNSKEY records can be used for two different things and typically different DNSKEY records are used for each. First, there are key signing keys (KSK) which are used to sign other DNSKEY records containing zone signing keys (ZSK), which are used to sign other records. Since the ZSKs are under complete control and use by one particular DNS zone, they can be switched more easily and more often. As a result, ZSKs can be much shorter than KSKs and still offer the same level of protection while reducing the size of the RRSIG/DNSKEY records.

When a new KSK is created, the DS record must be transferred to the parent zone and published there. The DS records use a message digest of the KSK instead of the complete key in order to keep the size of the records small. This is helpful for zones such as the .com domain, which are very large. The procedure to update DS keys in the parent zone is also simpler than earlier DNSSEC versions that required DNSKEY records to be in the parent zone.

A closely related principle is that of Algorithm rollover, this involves migrating a zone from one signing Algorithm to another. A good example of this would be migrating from Algorithm 8 (RSA/SHA-256) to Algorithm 13 (ECDSA/SHA-256). Several ccTLD&#x27;s have already migrated including .at, .br, .cz, .ch, .fr, .ie, .nl and .ph. Verisign migrated .com, .net and .edu to Algorithm 13 in late 2023. The migration of the root domain from Algorithm 8 to Algorithm 13 is currently in planning as of early 2024.

===DANE Working Group===
DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) is an IETF working group with the goal of developing protocols and techniques that allow Internet applications to establish cryptographically secured communications with TLS, DTLS, SMTP, and S/MIME based on DNSSEC.

The new protocols will enable additional assurances and constraints for the traditional model based on public key infrastructure. They will also enable domain holders to assert certificates for themselves, without reference to third-party certificate authorities.

Support for DNSSEC stapled certificates was enabled in Google Chrome 14, but was later removed. For Mozilla Firefox, support was provided by an add-on while native support is currently awaiting someone to start working on it.

==History==
DNS is a critical and fundamental Internet service, yet in 1990 Steve Bellovin discovered serious security flaws in it. Research into securing it began, and progressed dramatically when his paper was made public in 1995. The initial RFC 2065 was published by the IETF in 1997, and initial attempts to implement that specification led to a revised (and believed fully workable) specification in 1999 as IETF RFC 2535. Plans were made to deploy DNSSEC based on RFC 2535.

Unfortunately, the IETF RFC 2535 specification had very significant problems scaling up to the full Internet; by 2001 it became clear that this specification was unusable for large networks. In normal operation DNS servers often get out of sync with their parents. This isn&#x27;t usually a problem, but when DNSSEC is enabled, this out-of-sync data could have the effect of a serious self-created denial of service. The original DNSSEC required a complex six-message protocol and a lot of data transfers to perform key changes for a child (DNS child zones had to send all of their data up to the parent, have the parent sign each record, and then send those signatures back to the child for the child to store in a SIG record). Also, public key changes could have absurd effects; for example, if the &quot;.com&quot; zone changed its public key, it would have to send 22 million records (because it would need to update all of the signatures in all of its children). Thus, DNSSEC as defined in RFC 2535 could not scale up to the Internet.

The IETF fundamentally modified DNSSEC, which is called &quot;DNSSEC-bis&quot; when necessary to distinguish it from the original DNSSEC approach of RFC 2535. This new version uses &quot;delegation signer (DS) resource records&quot; to provide an additional level of indirection at delegation points between a parent and child zone. In the new approach, when a child&#x27;s master public key changes, instead of having six messages for every record in the child, there is one simple message: the child sends the new public key to its parent (signed, of course). Parents simply store one master public key for each child; this is much more practical. This means that a little data is pushed to the parent, instead of massive amounts of data being exchanged between the parent and children. This does mean that clients have to do a little more work when verifying keys. More specifically, verifying a DNS zone&#x27;s KEY RRset requires two signature verification operations instead of the one required by RFC 2535 (there is no impact on the number of signatures verified for other types of RRsets). Most view this as a small price to pay, since it makes DNSSEC deployment more practical. The new version is published in RFC4033-4035.

In January 2024, a &quot;KeyTrap&quot; denial-of-service attack was announced for all specification-respecting DNSSEC resolvers. The DNSSEC specification (RFC4033-4035) specifies that a resolver, when receiving a signed packet from the upstream, should try &quot;all&quot; keys with the correct &quot;tag&quot; on &quot;all&quot; signatures until one of the combinations successfully verifies. By putting many keys with the same &quot;tag&quot; and many signatures corresponding to that &quot;tag&quot; in a packet, the researchers can slow down a resolver by a factor of 2 million. In response, resolvers began to place limits on the amount of verification errors, key tag collisions, and hash calculations.

==Authenticating NXDOMAIN responses and NSEC==
Cryptographically proving the absence of a domain requires signing the response to every query for a non-existent domain. This is not a problem for online signing servers, which keep their keys available online. However, DNSSEC was designed around using offline computers to sign records so that zone-signing-keys could be kept in cold storage. This represents a problem when trying to authenticate responses to queries for non-existent domains since it is impossible to pre-generate a response to every possible hostname query.

The initial solution was to create NSEC records for every pair of domains in a zone. Thus if a client queried for a record at the non-existent codice_1, the server would respond with an NSEC record stating that nothing exists between codice_2 and codice_3. However, this leaks more information about the zone than traditional unauthenticated NXDOMAIN errors because it exposes the existence of real domains.

===Preventing domain walking===
The NSEC3 records (RFC 5155) were created as an alternative which hashes the name instead of listing them directly. Over time, advancements in hashing using GPUs and dedicated hardware meant that NSEC3 responses could be cheaply brute forced using offline dictionary attacks. NSEC5 has been proposed to allow authoritative servers to sign NSEC responses without having to keep a private key that can be used to modify the zone. Thus stealing an NSEC5KEY would only result in the ability to more easily enumerate a zone.

Due to the messy evolution of the protocol and a desire to preserve backwards compatibility, online DNSSEC signing servers return a &quot;white lie&quot; instead of authenticating a denial of existence directly. The technique outlined in RFC 4470 returns a NSEC record in which the pairs of domains lexically surrounding the requested domain. For example, request for codice_1 would thus result in an NSEC record proving that nothing exists between the (fictitious) domains codice_5 and codice_6. This is also possible with NSEC3 records.

CloudFlare pioneered a pair of alternative approaches, which manage to achieve the same result in one third of the response size. The first is a variation on the &quot;white lies&quot; approach, called &quot;black lies&quot;, which exploits common DNS client behavior to state the nonexistence more compactly. The second approach instead chooses to prove that &quot;the record exists but the requested record type does not&quot;, which they call &quot;DNS shotgun&quot;.

==Deployment==
The Internet is critical infrastructure, yet its operation depends on the fundamentally insecure DNS.
Thus, there is strong incentive to secure DNS, and deploying DNSSEC is generally considered to be a critical part of that effort.
For example, the U.S. &quot;National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace&quot; specifically identified the need to secure DNS.
Wide-scale deployment of DNSSEC could resolve many other security problems as well, such as secure key distribution for e-mail addresses.

DNSSEC deployment in large-scale networks is also challenging. Ozment and Schechter observe that DNSSEC (and other technologies) has a &quot;bootstrap problem&quot;: users typically only deploy a technology if they receive an immediate benefit, but if a minimal level of deployment is required before &quot;any&quot; users receive a benefit greater than their costs (as is true for DNSSEC), it is difficult to deploy. DNSSEC can be deployed at any level of a DNS hierarchy, but it must be widely available in a zone before many others will want to adopt it. DNS servers must be updated with software that supports DNSSEC, and DNSSEC data must be created and added to the DNS zone data. A TCP/IP-using client must have their DNS resolver (client) updated before it can use DNSSEC&#x27;s capabilities. What is more, any resolver must have, or have a way to acquire, at least one public key that it can trust before it can start using DNSSEC.

DNSSEC implementation can add significant load to some DNS servers. Common DNSSEC-signed responses are far larger than the default UDP size of 512 bytes. In theory, this can be handled through multiple IP fragments, but many &quot;middleboxes&quot; in the field do not handle these correctly. This leads to the use of TCP instead. Yet many current TCP implementations store a great deal of data for each TCP connection; heavily loaded servers can run out of resources simply trying to respond to a larger number of (possibly bogus) DNSSEC requests. Some protocol extensions, such as TCP Cookie Transactions, have been developed to reduce this loading. To address these challenges, significant effort is ongoing to deploy DNSSEC, because the Internet is so vital to so many organizations.

===Early deployments===
Early adopters include Brazil (.br), Bulgaria (.bg), Czech Republic (.cz), Namibia (.na) Puerto Rico (.pr) and Sweden (.se), who use DNSSEC for their country code top-level domains; RIPE NCC, who have signed all the reverse lookup records (in-addr.arpa) that are delegated to it from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). ARIN is also signing their reverse zones. In February 2007, TDC became the first Swedish ISP to start offering this feature to its customers.

IANA publicly tested a sample signed root since June 2007. During this period prior to the production signing of the root, there were also several alternative trust anchors. The IKS Jena introduced one on January 19, 2006, the Internet Systems Consortium introduced another on March 27 of the same year, while ICANN themselves announced a third on February 17, 2009.

On June 2, 2009, Afilias, the registry service provider for Public Interest Registry&#x27;s .org zone signed the .org TLD. Afilias and PIR also detailed on September 26, 2008, that the first phase, involving large registrars it has a strong working relationship with (&quot;friends and family&quot;) would be the first to be able to sign their domains, beginning &quot;early 2009&quot;. On June 23, 2010, 13 registrars were listed as offering DNSSEC records for .ORG domains.

VeriSign ran a pilot project to allow .com and .net domains to register themselves for the purpose of NSEC3 experimentation. On February 24, 2009, they announced that they would deploy DNSSEC across all their top-level domains (.com, .net, etc.) within 24 months, and on November 16 of the same year, they said the .com and .net domains would be signed by the first quarter of 2011, after delays caused by technical aspects of the implementation. This goal was achieved on-schedule and Verisign&#x27;s DNSSEC VP, Matt Larson, won InfoWorld&#x27;s Technology Leadership Award for 2011 for his role in advancing DNSSEC.

===Deployment at the DNS root===
DNSSEC was first deployed at the root level on July 15, 2010. This is expected to greatly simplify the deployment of DNSSEC resolvers, since the root trust anchor can be used to validate any DNSSEC zone that has a complete chain of trust from the root. Since the chain of trust must be traced back to a trusted root without interruption in order to validate, trust anchors must still be configured for secure zones if any of the zones above them are not secure. For example, if the zone &quot;signed.example.org&quot; was secured but the &quot;example.org&quot; zone was not, then, even though the &quot;.org&quot; zone and the root are signed, a trust anchor has to be deployed in order to validate the zone.

Political issues surrounding signing the root have been a continuous concern, primarily about some central issues:
* Other countries are concerned about U.S. control over the Internet, and may reject any centralized keying for this reason.
* Some governments might try to ban DNSSEC-backed encryption key distribution.

====Planning====
In September 2008, ICANN and VeriSign each published implementation proposals and in October, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) asked the public for comments. It is unclear if the comments received affected the design of the final deployment plan.

On June 3, 2009, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced plans to sign the root by the end of 2009, in conjunction with ICANN, VeriSign and the NTIA.

On October 6, 2009, at the 59th RIPE Conference meeting, ICANN and VeriSign announced the planned deployment timeline for deploying DNSSEC within the root zone. At the meeting it was announced that it would be incrementally deployed to one root name server a month, starting on December 1, 2009, with the final root name server serving a DNSSEC signed zone on July 1, 2010, and the root zone will be signed with a RSA/SHA256 DNSKEY. During the incremental roll-out period the root zone will serve a &quot;Deliberately Unvalidatable Root Zone&quot; (DURZ) that uses dummy keys, with the final DNSKEY record not being distributed until July 1, 2010. This means the keys that were used to sign the zone use are deliberately unverifiable; the reason for this deployment was to monitor changes in traffic patterns caused by the larger responses to queries requesting DNSSEC resource records.

The .org top-level domain was signed with DNSSEC in June 2010, followed by .com, .net, and .edu later in 2010 and 2011. Country code top-level domains were able to deposit keys starting in May 2010. more than 25% of top-level domains are signed with DNSSEC.

====Implementation====
On January 25, 2010, the L (ell) root server began serving a &quot;Deliberately Unvalidatable Root Zone&quot; (DURZ). The zone uses signatures of a SHA-2 (SHA-256) hash created using the RSA algorithm, as defined in . As of May 2010, all thirteen root servers began serving the DURZ. On July 15, 2010, the first root full production DNSSEC root zone was signed, with the SOA serial 2010071501. Root trust anchors are available from IANA.

===Deployment at the TLD level===
Underneath the root there is a large set of top-level domains that must be signed in order to achieve full DNSSEC deployment. The List of Internet top-level domains provides details about which of the existing top-level domains have been signed and linked to the root.

===DNSSEC Lookaside Validation - historical===
In March 2006, the Internet Systems Consortium introduced the DNSSEC Lookaside Validation registry. DLV was intended to make DNSSEC easier to deploy in the absence of a root trust anchor. At the time it was imagined that a validator might have to maintain large numbers of trust anchors corresponding to signed subtrees of the DNS. The purpose of DLV was to allow validators to offload the effort of managing a trust anchor repository to a trusted third party. The DLV registry maintained a central list of trust anchors, instead of each validator repeating the work of maintaining its own list.

To use DLV, a validator that supports it was needed, such as BIND or Unbound, configured with a trust anchor for a DLV zone. This zone contained DLV records; these had exactly the same format as DS records, but instead of referring to a delegated sub-zone, they referred to a zone elsewhere in the DNS tree. When the validator could not find a chain of trust from the root to the RRset it is trying to check, it searched for a DLV record that could provide an alternative chain of trust.

Gaps in the chain of trust, such as unsigned top-level domains or registrars that did not support DNSSEC delegations, meant administrators of lower-level domains could use DLV to allow their DNS data to be validated by resolvers which had been configured to use DLV. This may have hindered DNSSEC deployment by taking pressure off registrars and TLD registries to properly support DNSSEC. DLV also added complexity by adding more actors and code paths for DNSSEC validation.

ISC decommissioned its DLV registry in 2017. DLV support was deprecated in BIND 9.12 and completely removed from BIND 9.16. Unbound version 1.5.4 (July 2015) marked DLV as decommissioned in the example configuration and manual page. Knot Resolver and PowerDNS Recursor never implemented DLV.

In March 2020, the IETF published , retiring DLV as a standard and moving RFC 4432 and RFC 5074 to &quot;Historic&quot; status.

===DNSSEC deployment initiative by the U.S. federal government===
The Science and Technology Directorate of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sponsors the &quot;DNSSEC Deployment Initiative&quot;.
This initiative encourages &quot;all sectors to voluntarily adopt security measures that will improve security of the Internet&#x27;s naming infrastructure, as part of a global, cooperative effort that involves many nations and organizations in the public and private sectors.&quot;
DHS also funds efforts to mature DNSSEC and get it deployed inside the U.S. federal government.

It was reported that on March 30, 2007, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security proposed &quot;to have the key to sign the DNS root zone solidly in the hands of the US government.&quot; However no U.S. Government officials were present in the meeting room and the comment that sparked the article was made by another party. DHS later commented on why they believe others jumped to the false conclusion that the U.S. Government had made such a proposal: &quot;The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is funding the development of a technical plan for implementing DNSSec, and last October distributed an initial draft of it to a long list of international experts for comments. The draft lays out a series of options for who could be the holder, or &quot;operator,&quot; of the Root Zone Key, essentially boiling down to a governmental agency or a contractor. &quot;Nowhere in the document do we make any proposal about the identity of the Root Key Operator,&quot; said Maughan, the cyber-security research and development manager for Homeland Security.&quot;

===DNSSEC deployment in the U.S. federal government===

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published NIST Special Publication 800-81 Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide on May 16, 2006, with guidance on how to deploy DNSSEC. NIST intended to release new DNSSEC Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements in NIST SP800-53-R1, referencing this deployment guide. U.S. agencies would then have had one year after final publication of NIST SP800-53-R1 to meet these new FISMA requirements. However, at the time NSEC3 had not been completed. NIST had suggested using split domains, a technique that is known to be possible but is difficult to deploy correctly, and has the security weaknesses noted above.

On 22 August 2008, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a memorandum requiring U.S. Federal Agencies to deploy DNSSEC across .gov sites; the .gov root must be signed by January 2009, and all subdomains under .gov must be signed by December 2009. While the memo focuses on .gov sites, the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency says it intends to meet OMB DNSSEC requirements in the .mil (U.S. military) domain as well. NetworkWorld&#x27;s Carolyn Duffy Marsan stated that DNSSEC &quot;hasn&#x27;t been widely deployed because it suffers from a classic chicken-and-egg dilemma... with the OMB mandate, it appears the egg is cracking.&quot;

===Deployment in resolvers===
Several ISPs have started to deploy DNSSEC-validating DNS recursive resolvers. Comcast became the first major ISP to do so in the United States, announcing their intentions on October 18, 2010 and completing deployment on January 11, 2012.

According to a study at APNIC, the proportion of clients who exclusively use DNS resolvers that perform DNSSEC validation rose to 8.3% in May 2013. About half of these clients were using Google&#x27;s public DNS resolver.

In September 2015, Verisign announced their free public DNS resolver service, and although unmentioned in their press releases, it also performs DNSSEC validation.

By the beginning of 2016, APNIC&#x27;s monitoring showed the proportion of clients who exclusively use DNS resolvers that perform DNSSEC validation had increased to about 15%.

====DNSSEC support====

Google&#x27;s public recursive DNS server enabled DNSSEC validation on May 6, 2013.

BIND, the most popular DNS management software, enables DNSSEC support by default since version 9.5.

The Quad9 public recursive DNS has performed DNSSEC validation on its main 9.9.9.9 address since it was established on May 11, 2016. Quad9 also provides an alternate service which does not perform DNSSEC validation, principally for debugging.

===Deployment in infrastructure===

In September 2023, Microsoft announced it would utilize DNSSEC (via DANE) to verify the authenticity of certificates during SMTP communications.

==Tools==

DNSSEC deployment requires software on the server and client side. Some of the tools that support DNSSEC include:

* Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 include a &quot;security-aware&quot; stub resolver that is able to differentiate between secure and non-secure responses by a recursive name server. Windows Server 2012 DNSSEC is compatible with secure dynamic updates with Active Directory-integrated zones, plus Active Directory replication of anchor keys to other such servers.
* BIND, the most popular DNS name server (which includes dig), incorporates the newer &quot;DNSSEC-bis&quot; (DS records) protocol as well as support for NSEC3 records.
* Unbound is a DNS name server that was written from the ground up to be designed around DNSSEC concepts.
* mysqlBind, the GPL DNS management software for DNS ASPs, now supports DNSSEC.
* OpenDNSSEC is a designated DNSSEC signer tool using PKCS#11 to interface with hardware security modules.
* Knot DNS has added support for automatic DNSSEC signing in version 1.4.0.
* PowerDNS fully supports DNSSEC as of version 3.0 in pre-signed and live-signed modes.

<text>The National Socialist Movement (NSM) was a British neo-Nazi group active during the late 1990s. The group is not connected to the earlier National Socialist Movement of Colin Jordan.

==Origins==
The roots of the NSM lay in a split that developed in Combat 18 in the mid to late 1990s. In early 1997 it was claimed on ITV&#x27;s &quot;World in Action&quot; that the original leader of Combat 18 Charlie Sargent, who at the time was on remand for the murder of fellow C18 member Chris Castle, had acted as a paid informant for the police, although no evidence for this allegation was provided. Whilst Sargent was disowned by some of the rank and file membership of C18, his brother Steve, also a C18 member, supported Sargent and together with David Myatt led away fifty or so like-minded members to form a separate group, the National Socialist Movement, in June 1997.

==Development==
David Myatt was the first leader of the NSM until his resignation in March 1998 following his arrest by detectives from Scotland Yard on charges relating to incitement to racial hatred and incitement to murder when Tony Williams, a former member of the International Third Position, assumed the position of leader. Williams, who had also been involved with the National Front since the 1970s, had been the person chosen to escort the ashes of Savitri Devi to Arlington, Virginia where they were given to the American Nazi Party. As leader, the duties of Williams included overseeing membership inquiries and levying the £10 annual fee from registered supporters.

Mike Whine of the Board of Deputies of British Jews described the NSM as a &quot;very small but very violent neo-Nazi group. Their whole programme is one of terrorism ... against Jews, against blacks and against Asians.&quot; Myatt, who was the architect of the NSM, denied that NSM supported racial hatred but admitted that they intended to accomplish their aim of &quot;an entirely new society, based upon personal honour&quot; through revolutionary activity. The group&#x27;s own mission statement claimed that the NSM was &quot;formed in June 108 yf [&quot;Year of the Führer&quot; - a system of measuring the years from Adolf Hitler&#x27;s birth also employed by the National Alliance and similar groups] for the purpose of championing the cause of Aryan identity and Aryan freedom&quot; whilst also committing the group to the establishment of a &quot;National Socialist State&quot;, and although the NSM claimed to be a political party, much of its literature advocated violent revolution.

Steve Sargent served as propaganda director of the new group and produced their magazine &quot;White Dragon&quot;, which, although a neo-Nazi publication, garnered a following due to its often humorous style of reporting and Sargent&#x27;s propensity to fill its pages with his take on events at his favourite football club, Arsenal. A further magazine was also published in support of the NSM, sharing the name &quot;Column 88&quot; with an earlier neo-Nazi paramilitary group, although this was as much a personal concern of Williams as &quot;White Dragon&quot; was of Sargent.

==Nail bomber==
The NSM was not widely known until 1999 when David Copeland, the London nail-bomber, received six life sentences for his April 1999 bombing campaign against London&#x27;s black, Asian, and gay communities, which killed three people, including a pregnant woman, and injured 129, some of whom lost limbs. Copeland, who had joined the NSM after becoming disillusioned with the British National Party, served as Hampshire organiser for the group.

David Myatt would claim that the attacks had been the work of Copeland on his own and could not be blamed on the NSM. Nonetheless the arrest of Copeland saw the other members of the NSM go to ground.

<text>The Stations of the Cross or the Way of the Cross, also known as the Way of Sorrows or the , are a series of images depicting Jesus Christ on the day of his crucifixion and accompanying prayers. The stations grew out of imitations of the in Jerusalem, which is a traditional processional route symbolising the path Jesus walked to Mount Calvary. The objective of the stations is to help the Christian faithful to make a spiritual pilgrimage through contemplation of the Passion of Christ. It has become one of the most popular devotions and the stations can be found in many Western Christian churches, including those in the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist traditions.

Commonly, a series of 14 images will be arranged in numbered order along a path, along which worshippers—individually or in a procession—move in order, stopping at each station to say prayers and engage in reflections associated with that station. These devotions are most common during Lent, especially on Good Friday, and reflect a spirit of reparation for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during his passion. As a physical devotion involving standing, kneeling and genuflections, the Stations of the Cross are tied with the Christian themes of repentance and mortification of the flesh.

The style, form, and placement of the stations vary widely. The typical stations are small plaques with reliefs or paintings placed around a church nave. Modern minimalist stations can be simple crosses with a numeral in the centre. Occasionally, the faithful might say the stations of the cross without there being any image, such as when the pope leads the stations of the cross around the Colosseum in Rome on Good Friday.

== History ==


The Stations of the Cross originated from the pilgrimage to Jerusalem in Roman Judaea and a desire to reproduce the Via Dolorosa. Imitating holy places was not a new concept. For example, the religious complex of Santo Stefano in Bologna, Italy, replicated the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and other religious sites, including the Mount of Olives and the Valley of Josaphat.

Following the siege of 1187, Jerusalem fell to the forces of Saladin, the first sultan of Egypt and Syria. Forty years later, members of the Franciscan religious order were allowed back into the Holy Land. Their founder, Francis of Assisi, held the Passion of Christ in special veneration and is said to have been the first person to receive stigmata. In 1217, Francis also founded the Custody of the Holy Land to guard and promote the devotion to Christian holy places. The Franciscans&#x27; efforts were recognized when Pope Clement VI officially proclaimed them the custodians of holy places in 1342. Although several travelers who visited the Holy Land during the 12–14th centuries (e.g. Riccoldo da Monte di Croce, Burchard of Mount Sion, and James of Verona), mention a &quot;Via Sacra&quot;, i.e. a settled route that pilgrims followed, there is nothing in their accounts to identify this with the Way of the Cross, as we understand it. The earliest use of the word &quot;stations&quot;, as applied to the accustomed halting-places along the Via Sacra at Jerusalem, occurs in the narrative of an English pilgrim, William Wey, who visited the Holy Land in the mid-15th century and described pilgrims following the footsteps of Christ to Golgotha. In 1521, a book called &quot;Geystlich Strass&quot; (German: &quot;spiritual road&quot;) was printed with illustrations of the stations in the Holy Land.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, the Franciscans began to build a series of outdoor shrines in Europe to duplicate their counterparts in the Holy Land. The number of stations at these shrines varied between seven and thirty; seven was common. These were usually placed, often in small buildings, along the approach to a church, as in a set of 1490 by Adam Kraft, leading to the Johanniskirche in Nuremberg. A number of rural examples were established as attractions in their own right, usually on attractive wooded hills. These include the Sacro Monte di Domodossola (1657) and Sacro Monte di Belmonte (1712), and form part of the Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy World Heritage Site, together with other examples on different devotional themes. The sculptures at these sites are very elaborate and often nearly life-size. Remnants of these sites are often referred to as calvary hills.

In 1686, in answer to their petition, Pope Innocent XI granted to the Franciscans the right to erect stations within their churches. In 1731, Pope Clement XII extended to all churches the right to have the stations, provided that a Franciscan father erected them, with the consent of the local bishop. At the same time the number of stations was fixed at fourteen. In 1857, the bishops of England were allowed to erect the stations by themselves, without the intervention of a Franciscan priest, and in 1862 this right was extended to bishops throughout the church.

==Stations==


The early set of seven scenes was usually numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11 and 14 from the list below. From the late 16th century to the present, the standard complement has consisted of 14 pictures or sculptures depicting the following scenes:
# Jesus is condemned to death
# Jesus takes up his Cross
# Jesus falls the first time
# Jesus meets his Mother
# Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry the Cross
# Veronica wipes the face of Jesus
# Jesus falls for the second time
# Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem
# Jesus falls for the third time
# Jesus is stripped of his garments (sometimes called the &quot;Division of Robes&quot;)
# Jesus is nailed to the Cross
# Jesus dies on the Cross
# Jesus is taken down from the Cross
# Jesus is laid in the tomb

Although not traditionally part of the Stations, the Resurrection of Jesus is sometimes included as an unofficial fifteenth station. One very different version, called the Via Lucis (&quot;Way of Light&quot;), comprising the Fourteen &quot;Stations of Light&quot; or &quot;Stations of the Resurrection&quot;, starts with Jesus rising from the dead and ends with Pentecost.

===Scriptural form===

Out of the fourteen traditional Stations of the Cross, only eight have a clear scriptural foundation. Station 4 appears out of order from scripture; Jesus&#x27;s mother is present at the crucifixion but is only mentioned after Jesus is nailed to the cross and before he dies (between stations 11 and 12). The scriptures contain no accounts whatsoever of any woman wiping Jesus&#x27;s face nor of Jesus falling as stated in Stations 3, 6, 7 and 9. Station 13 (Jesus&#x27;s body being taken down off the cross and laid in the arms of his mother Mary) differs from the gospels&#x27; record, which states that Joseph of Arimathea took Jesus down from the cross and buried him.

To provide a version of this devotion more closely aligned with the biblical accounts, Pope John Paul II introduced a new form of devotion, called the Scriptural Way of the Cross, on Good Friday 1991. He celebrated that form many times but not exclusively at the Colosseum in Italy, using the following sequence (as published by the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops):

# Jesus prays in the Garden of Gethsemane;
# Jesus is betrayed by Judas and arrested;
# Jesus is condemned by the Sanhedrin;
# Jesus is denied by Peter three times;
# Jesus is judged by Pilate;
# Jesus is scourged and crowned with thorns;
# Jesus takes up his cross;
# Jesus is helped by Simon of Cyrene to carry his cross;
# Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem;
# Jesus is crucified;
# Jesus promises his kingdom to the repentant thief;
# Jesus entrusts Mary and John to each other;
# Jesus dies on the cross; and
# Jesus is laid in the tomb.
In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI approved this set of stations for meditation and public celebration.

===The New Way of the Cross (Philippines)===
Another set of stations is used by the Catholic Church in the Philippines. Filipinos use this set during &quot;Visita Iglesia&quot;, which is usually undertaken during Holy Week:

# The Last Supper
# The Agony in Gethsemane
# Jesus Before the Sanhedrin
# Jesus is scourged and crowned with thorns
# Jesus Receives His Cross
# Jesus Falls under the weight of the Cross
# Simon of Cyrene Helps Jesus carry the Cross
# Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem
# Jesus is nailed to the Cross
# The Repentant Thief
# Mary and John at the Foot of the Cross
# Jesus dies on the Cross
# Jesus is laid in His Tomb
# Jesus rises from the Dead

==Modern usage==
In the Roman Catholic Church, the devotion may be conducted personally by the faithful, making their way from one station to another and saying the prayers, or by having an officiating celebrant move from cross to cross while the faithful make the responses. The stations themselves must consist of, at the very least, fourteen wooden crosses—pictures alone do not suffice—and they must be blessed by someone with the authority to erect stations.

Pope John Paul II led an annual public prayer of the Stations of the Cross at the Roman Colosseum on Good Friday. Originally, the pope himself carried the cross from station to station, but in his last years when age and infirmity limited his strength, John Paul presided over the celebration from a stage on the Palatine Hill, while others carried the cross. Just days prior to his death in 2005, Pope John Paul II observed the Stations of the Cross from his private chapel. Each year a different person is invited to write the meditation texts for the Stations. Past composers of the Papal Stations include several non-Catholics. The pope himself wrote the texts for the Great Jubilee in 2000 and used the traditional Stations.

The celebration of the Stations of the Cross is especially common on the Fridays of Lent, especially Good Friday. Community celebrations are usually accompanied by various songs and prayers. Particularly common as musical accompaniment is the Stabat Mater of which a few verses are sung between each station. At the end of each station the Adoramus Te is sometimes sung. The Alleluia is also sung, except during Lent.

Structurally, Mel Gibson&#x27;s 2004 film, &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, follows the Stations of the Cross.

==Debates==
===Place of Christ&#x27;s resurrection===
Some modern liturgists say the traditional Stations of the Cross are incomplete without a final scene depicting the empty tomb and the resurrection of Jesus because Jesus&#x27; rising from the dead was an integral part of his salvific work on Earth. Advocates of the traditional form of the Stations ending with the body of Jesus being placed in the tomb say the Stations are intended as a meditation on the atoning death of Jesus, and not as a complete picture of his life, death, and resurrection. Another point of contention, at least between some ranking liturgists and traditionalists, is (the use of) the &quot;New Way of the Cross&quot; being recited exclusively in the Philippines and by Filipinos abroad.

The Stations of the Resurrection (also known by the Latin name of &quot;Via Lucis,&quot; Way of Light) are used in some churches at Eastertide to meditate on the Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus Christ.

==Music==
Franz Liszt wrote a &quot;Via Crucis&quot; for choir, soloists and piano or organ or harmonium in 1879. In 1931, French organist Marcel Dupré improvised and transcribed musical meditations based on fourteen poems by Paul Claudel, one for each station.
Peter Maxwell Davies&#x27;s &quot;Vesalii Icones&quot; (1969), for male dancer, solo cello and instrumental ensemble, brings together the Stations of the Cross and a series of drawings from the anatomical treatise &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot; (1543) by the Belgian physician Andreas van Wesel (Vesalius). In Davies&#x27;s sequence, the final &quot;station&quot; represents the Resurrection, but of Antichrist, the composer&#x27;s moral point being the need to distinguish what is false from what is real.
David Bowie regarded his 1976 song &quot;Station to Station&quot; as &quot;very much concerned with the stations of the cross&quot;. Polish composer Paweł Łukaszewski wrote &quot;Via Crucis&quot; in 2000 and it was premiered by the Podlaska Opera and Orchestra on March 8, 2002. Stefano Vagnini&#x27;s 2002 modular oratorio, &quot;Via Crucis&quot;, is a composition for organ, computer, choir, string orchestra and brass quartet. Italian composer Fabio Mengozzi released his electronic album Via crucis in 2022.

As the Stations of the Cross are prayed during the season of Lent in Catholic churches, each station is traditionally followed by a verse of the Stabat Mater, composed in the 13th century by Franciscan Jacopone da Todi. James Matthew Wilson&#x27;s poetic sequence, &quot;The Stations of the Cross&quot;, is written in the same meter as da Todi&#x27;s poem.

==Literature==
Dimitris Lyacos&#x27; third part of the Poena Damni trilogy, &quot;The First Death&quot;, is divided into fourteen sections in order to emphasise the &quot;Via Dolorosa&quot; of its marooned protagonist during his ascent on the mount of the island which constitutes the setting of the work.

<text>The 1999 London nail bombings were a series of bomb explosions in London, England. Over three successive weekends between 17 and 30 April 1999, homemade nail bombs were detonated in Brixton in South London; at Brick Lane, Spitalfields, in the East End; and at the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho in the West End. Each bomb contained up to 1,500 100 mm nails, in duffel bags that were left in public spaces. The bombs killed three people and injured 140 people, four of whom lost limbs.

On 2 May 1999, the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch charged 22-year-old David Copeland with murder. Copeland, who became known as the &quot;London nail bomber&quot;, was a Neo-Nazi militant and a former member of two political groups, the British National Party and then the National Socialist Movement. The bombings were aimed at London&#x27;s black, Bengali, and LGBT communities. Copeland was convicted of murder in 2000 and given six life sentences.

==Overview==
===Electric Avenue bomb===

The first bombing, on Saturday, 17 April 1999, was in Electric Avenue, Brixton, an area of south London with a large black population. The bomb was made using explosives from fireworks, taped inside a sports bag, primed and left at Brixton Market. The Brixton Market traders became suspicious, and one of them, Gary Shilling, moved the bag to a less crowded area after seeing perpetrator Copeland acting suspiciously. Two further moves of the bomb occurred by unconvinced traders, including the bomb being removed from the bag, which is when it ended up next to the Iceland supermarket. Concerned traders called the police, who arrived at the scene just as the bomb detonated at 5:25 pm. Forty-eight people were injured, many of them seriously because of the nails that were packed around the bomb. The explosion was strong, sending nails in all directions, blowing windows and blasting a parked car across the street.

===Brick Lane bomb===
The second bomb, on the following Saturday, 24 April, was aimed at Brick Lane in the East End of London, which has a large Bangladeshi community. There is a street market on Sundays, but perpetrator Copeland mistakenly tried to plant the bomb on Saturday when the street was less busy. Unwilling to change the timer on the bomb, he instead left it in a black Reebok bag on Hanbury Street. There it was picked up by a man who brought it to the police station on Brick Lane, which was shut. The man had placed it in the boot of his Ford Sierra car which was parked outside number 42 Brick Lane, where it exploded. Thirteen people were injured, and surrounding buildings and cars were severely damaged.

===Admiral Duncan bomb===
The third and final bomb was planted and detonated on the evening of Friday, 30 April at The Admiral Duncan pub on Old Compton Street in Soho, the heart of London&#x27;s gay community. At the time the pub and the street outside were crowded because the evening was the start of a bank holiday weekend. The unattended sports bag containing the bomb, which was taped inside, was noticed by patrons of the Admiral Duncan; however, the bomb exploded at 6:37 pm just as the bag was being investigated by the pub manager, Mark Taylor. Three people were killed and a total of seventy-nine were injured, many of them seriously. Four of the survivors had to have limbs amputated.
==Victims==
At the pub bombing in Soho, Andrea Dykes, 27, four months pregnant with her first child, died along with her friends and hosts for the evening, Nik Moore, 31, and John Light, 32, who was to be the baby&#x27;s godfather. Andrea&#x27;s husband, Julian, whom she married in August 1997, was seriously injured. The four friends from Essex had met up in the Admiral Duncan to celebrate Andrea&#x27;s pregnancy.

==Investigation and arrest==
Following the Brixton bombing, officials initially emphasised that IRA involvement was unlikely and that it was more likely to be the work of right-wing terrorists following the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry that was released at the time, or a &#x27;copycat&#x27; of Edgar Pearce. On 19 April, Combat 18, a neo-Nazi terrorist organisation, claimed responsibility via telephone. By the time of the Brick Lane bombing a week later, which the police linked with the Brixton bombing, it was clear that a racist entity was behind the attacks. It also ignited fears of racial tensions, particularly after the release of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry in February, and as Brixton was the scene of race riots in 1981.

Although these had been described by the police as specifically race-hate attacks, they had issued a warning that a gay bar could potentially be the bomber&#x27;s next target, and The Yard – a pub in the Soho area – had displayed a poster warning customers to be alert. On Thursday, 29 April, CCTV footage from the Brixton attack was given wide publicity after an image of the suspected bomber was identified on it. This caused Copeland to bring forward his planned bombing of the Admiral Duncan to Friday evening. Paul Mifsud, a colleague of Copeland, recognised him from the footage and alerted the police about an hour and twenty minutes before the third bombing.

The Admiral Duncan bombing was linked to the previous ones by police, with far-rightists once again the prime suspects. Two hours after the bomb, the neo-Nazi White Wolves organisation claimed responsibility for the attack. It was feared other ethnic minorities, such as Jews and Asians, would be targeted next. Some synagogues increased security as a result.

Copeland was arrested that night once the police obtained his address, a rented room in Sunnybank Road, Cove, Hampshire. He admitted carrying out the three bombings as soon as he opened the door to the police, telling them, &quot;Yeah, they were all down to me. I did them on my own.&quot; He showed them his room, where two Nazi flags were hanging on a wall, along with a collection of photographs and newspaper stories about bombings.

In May 2021 the informant &#x27;Arthur&#x27; who identified Copeland spoke to &quot;The Guardian&quot; about David Copeland and the contemporary threat from the extreme right.

==Perpetrator==

David James Copeland was born on 15 May 1976, in Hanworth in the London Borough of Hounslow, to a working-class couple. His father was an engine driver and his mother was a housewife. Copeland lived for most of his childhood with his parents and two brothers in Yateley in Hampshire, attending Yateley School, where he obtained seven GCSEs before leaving in 1992. Journalist Nick Ryan wrote that, as a teenager, Copeland feared he was homosexual; when his parents sang along to &quot;The Flintstones&quot; theme on television—&quot;we&#x27;ll have a gay old time&quot;—he reportedly believed they were sending him a message. As an older teenager, he began listening to heavy metal bands and earned himself the nickname &quot;Mr Angry&quot;. Ryan wrote that the staff at his school have no recollection of him during this period, as if he had become invisible.

After his arrest following the bombings, Copeland told psychiatrists that he had started having sadomasochistic dreams when he was about twelve years old, including dreams or fantasies that he had been reincarnated as an SS officer with access to women as slaves. He left school for a series of failed jobs, reportedly blaming immigrants for the difficult job market. Copeland became involved in petty crime, drinking and drug abuse. His father was eventually able to get him a job as an engineer&#x27;s assistant on the London Underground.

Copeland&#x27;s father called him &quot;fairly intelligent&quot; as a child. His parents separated when he was aged 19, and his mother told lawyers and psychiatrists after the arrest that he was a &quot;happy lad&quot; and showed no sign of what was to come. According to psychiatrists, Copeland also had a higher than average IQ. One of the doctors believed his behaviour started to change around 1995 when he was 19, isolating himself from friends and family.

===Political views===
Copeland joined the far-right British National Party (BNP) in May 1997, at the age of 21. He acted as a steward at a BNP meeting, in the course of which he came into contact with the party&#x27;s senior members and was photographed standing next to John Tyndall, the leader of the party at the time. During this period Copeland read &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;, and first learnt how to make bombs using fireworks with alarm clocks as timers after downloading the &quot;Anarchist Cookbook&quot; from the Internet. Copeland left the BNP in 1998, regarding it as insufficiently hardline because it was not willing to engage in paramilitary action, and joined the smaller National Socialist Movement, becoming its regional leader for Hampshire just weeks before the start of his bombing campaign. It was around this time that he visited his family doctor and was prescribed anti-depressants after telling the doctor he felt he was losing his mind.

===Motivation===
Copeland maintained he had worked alone and had not discussed his plans with anyone. During police interviews, he admitted holding neo-Nazi views and talked of his desire to spread fear and trigger a race war. He told police, &quot;My main intent was to spread fear, resentment and hatred throughout this country; it was to cause a racial war.&quot; He said, &quot;If you&#x27;ve read &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;, you know the year 2000 there&#x27;ll be the uprising and all that, racial violence on the streets. My aim was political. It was to cause a racial war in this country. There&#x27;d be a backlash from the ethnic minorities, then all the white people will go out and vote BNP.&quot;

After his arrest, Copeland wrote to BBC correspondent Graeme McLagan, denying that he had schizophrenia, and telling McLagan that the &quot;Zog&quot; or Zionist Occupation Government was pumping him full of drugs in order to sweep him under the carpet. He wrote, &quot;I bomb the blacks, Pakis, degenerates. I would have bombed the Jews as well if I&#x27;d got a chance.&quot; Ryan writes that Copeland&#x27;s first idea had been to bomb the Notting Hill Carnival after seeing images of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing. When asked by police why he had targeted ethnic minorities, he replied, &quot;Because I don&#x27;t like them, I want them out of this country, I believe in the master race.&quot; Whilst on remand, Copeland also wrote to crime writer Bernard O&#x27;Mahoney, who posed as a woman called Patsy Scanlon in the hope of duping Copeland into confessing. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, the letters helped secure a conviction by giving prosecutors evidence about Copeland&#x27;s state of mind. In one letter to &quot;Scanlon&quot;, Copeland wrote about how he was faking mental illness and was amazed by how many experts accepted his lies; the letter was included in the trial and greatly damaged the hopes of his defence team getting a manslaughter conviction based on extenuating circumstances.

===Conviction===
Copeland&#x27;s mental state was assessed at Broadmoor Hospital. He was diagnosed by five psychiatrists as having paranoid schizophrenia, while one diagnosed a personality disorder not serious enough to avoid a charge of murder. There was no dispute that he was mentally ill, but the extent of this, and whether he was unable to take responsibility for his actions, became a matter of contention. At the Old Bailey, Copeland&#x27;s plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was not accepted by the prosecution or jury.

On 30 June 2000, Copeland was convicted of three counts of murder and planting bombs and given six life sentences. The trial judge doubted that it would ever be safe to release Copeland.

On 2 March 2007, the High Court decided that Copeland should remain in prison for at least fifty years, ruling out his release until 2049 at the earliest, when he would be 73. Copeland appealed; on 28 June 2011, the Court of Appeal upheld the ruling.

===Further conviction===
In June 2014, Copeland attacked a fellow inmate at HM Prison Belmarsh with a shiv, an improvised weapon made from razor blades attached to a toothbrush handle. In October 2015, he pleaded guilty to wounding with intent and was sentenced to a further three years in prison, of which he will serve eighteen months.

==Media==
The events of the 1999 bombings were the topic of several media investigations. In 2000, Nick Lowles wrote &quot;Mr. Evil: The Secret Life of Pub Bomber and Killer David Copeland&quot; (John Blake, 2000; ).

In early 2021, Netflix released the documentary &quot;Nail Bomber: Manhunt&quot;.

<text>Longyearbyen (, , &quot;Longyear Town&quot;) is the world&#x27;s northernmost settlement with a population greater than 1,000, and the largest inhabited area of Svalbard, Norway. It stretches along the foot of the left bank of the Longyear Valley and on the shore of Adventfjorden, the short estuary leading into Isfjorden on the west coast of Spitsbergen, the island&#x27;s broadest inlet. As of 2002 Longyearbyen Community Council became an official Norwegian municipality. It is the seat of the Governor of Svalbard. As of 2024, the town&#x27;s mayor is Leif Terje Aunevik.

Known as Longyear City until 1926, the town was established by and named after American John Munro Longyear, whose Arctic Coal Company started coal-mining there in 1906. Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani (SNSK) took over the mining operations in 1916, and still conducts mining. The German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; almost completely destroyed the town on 8 September 1943, but rebuilding took place after the Second World War. Historically, Longyearbyen was a company town, but most mining operations moved to Sveagruva during the 1990s, and production ceased in 2017 due to immense financial losses suffered by SNSK since 2014 due to market conditions. Meanwhile, the town has seen a large increase in tourism and research. This includes the arrival of institutions such as the University Centre in Svalbard, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault and Svalbard Satellite Station. Svalbard Airport, Svalbard Church and the Svalbardbutikken department store serve the community.

==History==


In 1896, Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab started tours to Hotellneset. To accommodate tourists, they built a prefabricated hotel, but it was not profitable and was closed after the 1897 season. However, two families overwintered in 1898–99, and Norway Post operated a post office at Hotellneset from 1897 to 1899. The first commercially viable coal on Svalbard was harvested by Søren Zakariassen in 1899. In 1901, Bergen-Spitsbergen Kullgrube-kompani started mining coal in Adventtoppen.

The American industrialist John Munro Longyear visited Spitsbergen as a tourist in 1901, and met with an expedition prospecting for coal. In 1903, he returned to Spitsbergen, where he met Henrik B. Næss in Adventfjorden, who gave him samples and information on coal fields. Along with his associate Frederick Ayer, Longyear bought the Norwegian claims on the west side of Adventfjorden, and expanded the claims significantly the following year. In 1906, the Boston-based Arctic Coal Company, with Ayer and Longyear as the main shareholders, started mining in Mine 1a, after building docks and housing. The company had American administration, but mostly Norwegian labourers, and named the town Longyear City. Coal was transported the from the mine to the port using an aerial tramway built by the aerial cableway company Adolf Bleichert &amp; Co. of Leipzig, Germany. In 1913, the company started preliminary work to open Mine 2a.

Following financial difficulties during the First World War, the mining operations were bought by Store Norske, which was incorporated in Oslo on 30 November 1916. That year, SNSK built five new barracks, including one that was made into a hospital. SNSK introduced its own money with the approval of Norges Bank, consisting entirely of banknotes at par with Norwegian krone. The American community buried their dead at Hotellneset. In 1918, eleven people were killed by the Spanish flu and a graveyard was established in Longyear City. Two years later, 26 men were killed in a coal dust explosion in Mine 1. This resulted in the mine being closed and the electrification of Mine 2. The same year, the first truck was delivered for use in the mining operations.

The Church of Norway appointed Thorleif Østenstad as Svalbard&#x27;s first vicar and teacher in 1920. A school was established jointly by the church and SNSK and had an inaugural eight pupils. The first church in Svalbard opened on 28 August 1921, and the church&#x27;s reading room was from then on used as a school. Longyear City was renamed Longyearbyen in 1926.

The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration established a coast radio station, Svalbard Radio, at Finneset in 1911, which was moved to Longyearbyen in 1930. The town&#x27;s tourist industry started in 1935, when SS &quot;Lyngen&quot; started calling regularly during the summer season. In 1937, SNSK established Sverdrupbyen to house workers for Mine 1b, and operation of the mine started in 1939. In 1938, Longyearbyen&#x27;s first road was completed, between the town centre and Sverdrupbyen. Operations at Mine 2b, a different entrance to Mine 2a, started in 1939.

Svalbard remained unaffected by the German occupation of Norway in 1940. However, from 1941 the archipelago became of strategic importance in the supply chain between the Allied powers, as well as a source of badly needed coal. The Norwegian government-in-exile rejected a Soviet–British occupation; instead the British Army started Operation Gauntlet to evacuate Spitsbergen. On 29 August 1941, the entire population of Ny-Ålesund was evacuated to Longyearbyen, and on 3 September 765 people were evacuated from Longyearbyen to Scotland. Later, the last 150 men were also evacuated. With Longyearbyen depopulated, a small German garrison and air strip were established in Adventdalen, mostly to provide meteorological data. After the British Operation Fritham regained control of Barentsburg, the German forces left Longyearbyen without combat.

In September 1943, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; dispatched two battleships, &quot;Tirpitz&quot; and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, and nine destroyers to bombard Longyearbyen, Barentsburg and Grumant. Only four buildings in Longyearbyen survived: the hospital, the power station, an office building, and a residential building. Longyearbyen remained unsettled until the end of the war, with the first ship from the mainland leaving on 27 June 1945.

===Post-Second World War===
Plans were laid during the war to ensure a quick reconstruction and restarting of mining. By 1948, coal production had reached the pre-war level of per year. Nybyen was established in 1946 and consisted of five barracks, each housing 72 people. The first issue of &quot;Svalbardposten&quot; was published in November 1948. Until then, various wall newspapers had been published irregularly. In 1949, Longyearbyen received a telephone connection with the mainland via a radio connection between Svalbard Radio and Harstad. In 1949, a farm was built in Longyearbyen to hold cattle (for milk), pigs, and hens. A local radio station started broadcasting in 1950. The burial ground remained in use until 1950, with 44 people buried. However, it was discovered that the bodies were failing to decompose because of the permafrost, and that they could be preserving various microorganisms. Bodies have since been sent to the mainland for burial. The community centre Huset opened in 1951.

Mining in Mine 1b was terminated in 1958, but operation in Mine 5 started the following year. Preliminary work on Mine 4 started in 1954, and from 1960 it was used as a reserve mine. The Norwegian Air Force started serving Longyearbyen with postal flights in the 1950s. In 1959, a man fell seriously ill, so a landing strip was prepared in Adventdalen. From the same year, Braathens SAFE started serving the tundra airport with irregular winter flights. In 1957, a principal was hired at the primary school and a new church was opened on 24 August 1958. From 1961, the primary school was supplemented by a private middle school. A branch of Tromsø Sparebank opened in 1959.

In the 1960s, the town&#x27;s farm was closed and replaced by industrial liquefaction of powdered milk. The first serial-produced snowmobile was taken into use in 1961. By 1969, there were 140 registered snowmobiles and only 33 registered cars. From 1962 to 1984, a recreational centre was run at Sverdrupbyen. Ordinary operation in Mine 4 started in 1966 but was terminated by 1970, two years after Mine 2b closed. Operations in Mine 6 commenced in 1969. Television broadcasting equipment was installed in 1969, with the schedule of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation being aired with a two-week delay.

In 1971, a new school building, with a combined primary and lower secondary school, was opened, along with a new gymnasium and a swimming pool. The Svalbard Council was established on 1 November 1971. It consisted of 17 non-partisan members who were elected or appointed in three different groups: SNSK employees, government employees and others, although the ratio changed several times. Operations of Mine 3 started in March 1971 and operations in Mine 7 commenced the following year. In 1973, the Ministry of Trade and Industry bought a third of SNSK. It continued buying additional shares until it reached a 99.94 per cent ownership in 1976. The airport was opened in 1975 and initially provided four weekly services to mainland Norway and semi-weekly services to Russia. In 1978, the community received satellite communications with the mainland. The same year, an upper secondary program was introduced at the public school. From 1984, television programmes were broadcast live via satellite.

Store Norske underwent a gradual change during the 1980s. Since 1980, Spitsbergen money has been taken out of circulation and replaced with ordinary Norwegian currency. Mine 6 closed the following year. From 1982, SNSK permitted private individuals to own and operate cars. By 1990, there were 353 registered cars and 883 snowscooters. On 1 July 1983, SNSK moved its head office from Bergen to Longyearbyen. Svalbard Samfunnsdrift (SSD), a limited company that was responsible for public infrastructure and services, was established by SNSK on 1 January 1989. Responsibilities included healthcare, the fire brigade, the kindergarten, roads, rubbish disposal, power production, the water and sewer system, the cinema, cultural activities and the library. Ownership was taken over by the Ministry of Trade and Industry on 1 January 1993.

During the 1990s, the authorities started a process to &quot;normalise&quot; Longyearbyen by abolishing the company town scheme and introducing a full range of services, a varied economy and local democracy. Commercial enterprises included a shopping mall replacing SNSK&#x27;s provision store in 1992. Similarly, Esso opened a commercial fuel station in 1994. The Svalbard Council changed its regulations from 1993 and allowed parties to run for election. In a step to increase tourism, Svalbard Polar Hotel opened in 1995, and a year later mining of Mine 3 terminated. Longyearbyen Community Council was established in 2002, replacing the Svalbard Council and assimilating SSD, and took on many of the responsibilities and the structure of a municipality.

This period also saw the rise of a number of scientific establishments. The Agricultural University of Norway had established a primitive seed bank in 1984. The University Centre in Svalbard opened on 6 September 1993 and had 30 students in its inaugural semester. Telenor Mobil established GSM coverage in 1995, and in 2004 the Svalbard Undersea Cable System opened, providing fiber-optic cable connection to the mainland. The European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) opened a radar in 1996, followed by Svalbard Satellite Station in 1999 and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in 2008.

==Geography==

Longyearbyen is in the lower portion of the Longyear Valley, along the Longyear River. The lower parts of the town lie along the southwestern shore of the bay of Adventfjorden, a branch of Isfjorden. Longyearbyen is on the Nordenskiöld Land peninsula of Spitsbergen, the largest island of the Svalbard archipelago. Across the bay lie the ghost towns of Advent City and Hiorthhamn. It is the world&#x27;s second northernmost town, with all settlements further north (excluding Ny-Ålesund) being research or meteorological outposts. The northernmost permanent settlement in the world is Alert, Canada, in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, while the true northernmost settlement in the world is Camp Barneo in April.

Longyearbyen is divided into several neighbourhoods. On the west side of the river, along the bay, lies the port and affiliated utility and industrial services. The western part of this area is called Bykaia and the eastern part Sjøområdet. Above lies Skjæringa, the site of the Governor&#x27;s offices. Slightly up the valley on the west side lies Gamle Longyearbyen (&quot;Old Longyearbyen&quot;) and the church. Even further up lies the graveyard, then Huset and the cinema, and finally Sverdrupbyen. Most of the residential, commercial and cultural institutions are on the east side of the river. Along the bay the area is called Sjøskrenten. Further up lies the university centre and Gruvedalen, the largest residential area. Southwards from there is the main shopping area as well as the town hall. To the east is the residential area Lia and further up Haugen, which is also the location of the school. Furthest up in the valley is Mine 2b and Nybyen, which is mostly used as student housing. Westwards out of town towards Hotellneset is the airport and Mine 3. The remaining mines are in Adventdalen, to the east of town.

=== Climate ===

Svalbard&#x27;s climate is a polar tundra climate (Köppen: ET) tempered by the North Atlantic Current. The west coast of Svalbard is the warmest and wettest part of the archipelago (except for Bear Island). This is caused by the convergence of mild and humid air from the south and cold air from the north. Longyearbyen generally has lower humidity than other settlements within the Arctic Circle. Longyearbyen experiences midnight sun from between 18 April and 23 August (127 days), polar night from 27 October to 15 February (111 days), and civil polar night from 13 November to 29 January. However, due to shading from mountains, the sun is not visible in Longyearbyen until around 8 March. Snow typically covers the town from November to March. The warmest temperature ever recorded in Longyearbyen was in July 2020 and the coldest was in March 1986. Svalbard and Longyearbyen are among the places in the world that have warmed fastest in the latest decades. The 1991–2020 averages show that mean annual temperature in Longyearbyen has increased by since 1961–1990. With the sea surface temperatures warming, ice formation takes longer in the surrounding waters and thus especially early winter under the polar night warms the fastest due to the shorter ice season.

, Longyearbyen is the fastest-warming town in the world. Since 1971, temperatures on Svalbard have risen five times faster than the global average, by roughly four degrees Celsius. Winters now are more than seven degrees C warmer than they were in the 1970s. In 2020, Svalbard recorded its hottest ever temperature, , following 111 months of above-average heat. According to the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, annual precipitation on Svalbard has increased by 30 to 45 per cent over the past 50 years, mostly in the form of winter rain. Since 2009, deep permafrost temperatures have increased at rates between 0.06 and 0.15-degree C per year.

Although Alert, Canada likely has a lower average UV index, Longyearbyen has the lowest recorded average UV index for any current or previously inhabited place on Earth. Between April and September, the UV index typically ranges from 1 to 2, with May, June, and July having the highest UV index of 2. All other months average at 0, giving Longyearbyen a mean UV index of 0.75 over 12 months.

==Demographics==

, Longyearbyen had a population of 1,753 people. The largest regional group of Norwegians are from Northern Norway, particularly Nordland and Troms, who make up more than 40% of the population (2012). Roughly 300 people (16%) are non-Norwegian citizens, with the largest nationalities being from Thailand, Sweden, Russia and Ukraine (2009). Because of the dominance of the mining industry, the gender distribution is skewed, with 60% of adults being males. Longyearbyen has an over-average share of its population between 25 and 44 years old, but nearly no residents over 66. The number of children in relation to the population is at the national average, but Longyearbyen has significantly fewer teenagers than the national average.

As of 2014, Thai people, numbering 120, were the second largest group of residents after Norwegians; there were 60 in 2006. Thais first came to Svalbard when men brought their wives from Thailand during the 1970s. In 2006, most of the Thai residents worked as cleaners, and as of 2011 most stay for terms of two to three years to save funds. In 2007, 10 students at the Longyearbyen School were Thai. The Thai community is active in numerous cultural events annually and motivated the establishment of a Thai supermarket.

Longyearbyen experiences a very high turnover; in 2008, 427 people (23%) moved away from the town. The average person lived in Longyearbyen for 6.3 years, although it is 6.6 years for Norwegians and 4.3 years for foreigners. In 2009, about a quarter of the population had lived in the town since before 2000, and can thus be regarded as its permanent population. The longest-residing people tend to work in the mining industry, followed by local government employees. The shortest tenures are held by students and employees in higher education, tourism and the state. The turnover has created what the Norwegian government calls a &quot;revolving door society&quot;. Most young newcomers leave within seven years, a turnover rate far greater than in any municipality on the mainland.

70% of households consist of a single person, compared to 41% on the mainland, giving an average 1.6 people per household. The difference is largely caused by persons working on Svalbard while their family remains on the mainland. Longyearbyen&#x27;s population is more highly educated than the national average: 54% compared to 43% have upper secondary education and 30% compared to 26% have tertiary education. Among women, 40% have higher education.

==Politics and government==

Longyearbyen Community Council has many of the same responsibilities as a municipality. It is organised with a 15-member council that since 2015 has been led by Mayor Arild Olsen of the Labour Party. The council&#x27;s main responsibilities are infrastructure and utilities, including power, land-use and community planning, education from kindergarten to upper secondary level and child welfare. It operates three kindergartens in addition to the 13-grade Longyearbyen School.
No care or nursing services and welfare payments are available. Norwegian residents retain pension and medical rights through their mainland municipalities. The University Hospital of North Norway operates a clinic, Longyearbyen Hospital. Other public offices with a presence on Longyearbyen are the Norwegian Directorate of Mining, the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Tax Administration and the Church of Norway. Longyearbyen is subordinate to Nord-Troms District Court and Hålogaland Court of Appeal, both in Tromsø.

The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 established full Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago. The treaty came into effect in 1925, following the &quot;Svalbard Act&quot; that established the institution of the Governor of Svalbard. The governor holds responsibility as both county governor and chief of police, as well as holding other authority granted from the executive branch. Duties include environmental policy, family law, law enforcement, search and rescue, tourism management, information services, contact with foreign settlements and judge in some areas of maritime inquiries and judicial examinations—albeit never in the same cases as acting as police. Kjerstin Askholt has been governor since 2015; she is assisted by a staff of 26 professionals. The institution is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and the Police, but reports to other ministries in matters within their portfolio.

 Because of the special treaty status of Svalbard, Longyearbyen is subject to Norwegian legislation, but citizens of any signatory country may conduct commercial activities and live in town. However, people without a source of income can be rejected by the governor. The treaty limits Norway&#x27;s right to collect taxes to that of financing services on Svalbard. Therefore, Longyearbyen has a lower income tax than mainland Norway, and there is no value added tax. The treaty has resulted in Longyearbyen being a demilitarized zone and it is not part of the European Economic Area nor of the Schengen Area like the rest of Norway.

Starting with the 2023 Norwegian local elections, voters for the Longyearbyen community council must have previously resided in mainland Norway for at least 3 years. Previously, foreign citizens who had lived in Longyearbyen itself for 3 years had also been allowed to vote, with the rule change disenfranchising a significant percentage of the settlement&#x27;s population.

=== Unique laws ===
Due to its remoteness, Longyearbyen has laws that are found in few, if any, other places in the world. Notable examples of such laws include a ban on cats, a restriction on the amount of alcohol an individual can purchase each month, and a requirement that any individuals venturing outside carry a rifle for protection against polar bears. While it is popularly claimed that it is illegal to die in Longyearbyen, the wording of this claim is misleading. While it is not actually illegal to die in the town, there are no options for burial of bodies there (ashes can be buried with permission from the government) and residents considered terminally ill are typically required to move to the mainland. The decision to disallow burials came in 1950, when it was discovered that the bodies of residents who had died as a result of the 1918 flu pandemic had not begun to decompose. Today, scientists are concerned that these corpses, preserved by permafrost may still harbor live strains of the virus responsible for killing between 1% and 6% of the world&#x27;s population during the early 20th century.

==Culture==
The community council runs a number of cultural activities, such as a cinema, a youth club, a library and a gallery. Svalbard Church of the Church of Norway has the entire archipelago as its parish. The congregational hall is while the sitting room is . The church is built in half-timber. There are two museums in town, Svalbard Museum and the Spitsbergen Airship Museum. Solfestuka (&quot;Sun Festival Week&quot;) takes place each year during the week surrounding 8 March, the date sunlight is first visible in most of the town after the polar night that began the previous October (the first official sunrise is usually 16 February, but most of the town is still in shadow due to the surrounding mountains). Dark Season Blues has been held annually in October since 2003. Polarjazz has been held in late January/early February since 1998. Twenty residents of the town are members of the Liverbirds Svalbard and regularly meet in the Svalbar on match days during the winter months. Arctic Film Festival is a film festival held annually in the city&#x27;s screening venue, Kulturhuset.
===Sports===
The town&#x27;s sole known organised sports club is Svalbard Turn. Svalbardhallen is an indoor sport centre that includes a multi-sport hall large enough for handball or three badminton courts, a shooting range, a climbing wall and a swimming pool.

The town has no outdoor sports fields, and there are no known cases of a senior team in any indoor or outdoor sport participating in a national Norwegian competition (e.g. Norwegian Cup). An under-16 boys futsal team representing Svalbard Turn, played in the small 2-day &quot;Per Bredesen Cup&quot; in Horten in March 2020.

Beyond the walls of Svalbardhallen, the websites of Svalbard Turn claim they host the Spitsbergen Marathon, the Svalbard Skimaraton (42.0km freestyle, though many participants use classic style), and an annual orienteering race.
===Media===
&quot;Svalbardposten&quot; is a weekly newspaper published on Friday. Printing takes place in Tromsø and the majority of subscribers live on the mainland. &quot;Icepeople&quot;, an alternative newspaper in English, is also published weekly.

For television, an edited feed of NRK1 began airing in 1969 on a 2-week delay; the broadcasts did not accomplish live broadcasting until 22 December 1984, which in turn resulted in Svalbard being added to the national newscasts&#x27; weather reports. Allente pay-TV satellite signals have effectively been receivable since the Canal Digital signals became publicly available in mainland Norway.

For radio, NRK P1 (most likely the Troms and Finnmark opt-out), P4 (Norway), and Radio Norge have been known to be available. As of July 2020, the Skjæringa mast was the only known remaining medium wave AM (or any AM range) broadcaster of an NRK station. DAB radio broadcasting began in August or September 2016, followed by FM radio shutting down in December 2017. Only the NRK DAB network with 13 stations was planned to be set up as of February 2016; the status for the commercial stations&#x27; DAB network (incl. P4 and Radio Norge) is unclear.

Fiber broadband is provided by the Svalbard Undersea Cable System.

===Popular culture===
&quot;Arctic Outpost Radio AM1270&quot; is an internet station since 2016 by the persona &quot;Cal Lockwood&quot; playing 78 rpm records, who claims to broadcast to the town on the medium wave 1270 kHz, whose website and its old hosting website are registered at Kansas City, Missouri. Only one individual claimed to have actually received the AM broadcast when he was in Longyearbyen in 2019.

==Economy==

Coal production peaked in 2007 at 4.1 million tonnes, and reduced to 1.1 million tonnes in 2015. The only mining still taking place in Longyearbyen is at Mine 7, up Adventdalen. In 2012 it produced of coal annually, of which is used to fuel Longyear Power Station, Norway&#x27;s only coal-fueled power station. The power station was scheduled for a NOK 60 million maintenance work, and the local authorities decided a NOK 40 million upgrade of the diesel power plant instead.

Most of Store Norske&#x27;s production was done at Sveagruva, on Van Mijenfjorden, south of Longyearbyen. No roads connect the communities; instead, workers lived in dormitories in Svea until it closed in 2017. Seventy per cent commute home to the mainland while thirty per cent commute to Longyearbyen. Mining has not been profitable and Store Norske relies on state subsidies to retain production.

Svalbard fisheries have witnessed an unforeseen consequence of global warming: Atlantic cod, mackerel, and snow crabs, fleeing warmer waters to the south, are heading north to Svalbard, swelling the local catch. In the decade of the 2020s, Norway values its Svalbard fishing trade at about US$94 million annually.

The University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) has 350 students and a permanent faculty of 40 professors and assistants and 120 guest lecturers. UNIS does not offer degrees, but instead offers semester courses in biology, physics and geology. Student housing is at Nybyen. The college is part of the Svalbard Science Centre, which also features the Norwegian Polar Institute, EISCAT and Svalbard Science Forum. In 2006, about 9,000 research days were spent in Longyearbyen, most of which were by Norwegians. This made Longyearbyen the second-largest research outpost on Svalbard, marginally below Ny-Ålesund. In contrast, Longyearbyen has almost only Norwegian research, while Ny-Ålesund is roughly evenly split between Norwegian and foreign.

Svalbard Satellite Station was built because of Longyearbyen&#x27;s excellent location to download data from satellites in polar orbit. At Platåberget above Hotellneset, it was built as a cooperation between NASA and the Norwegian Space Centre, but has since 2001 been operated by Kongsberg Satellite Services. EISCAT operates an incoherent scatter radar to study the northern lights. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, administered by the Global Crop Diversity Trust, is a secure underground facility capable of storing millions of crop seeds. The facility has been designed to protect against natural and human disasters, including global warming, floods and fires and nuclear holocaust. The site was chosen for a number of factors including its remoteness, sound geology and the ambient temperature of the permafrost.

Longyearbyen is the centre of tourism on the archipelago, although most tourism is generated based on natural experiences rather than visiting the town itself. However, Longyearbyen does provide supplies (including Svalbardbutikken, the area&#x27;s only grocery store), accommodation and several museums. In 2008, Longyearbyen experienced 89,000 guest-nights, up from 30,000 in 1995. The average guest stayed 2.2 nights and 60 per cent of the capacity was used by tourists. About 40,000 tourists flew into Longyearbyen. Two-thirds of the tourists come from Norway. In 2007, the tourism industry had a revenue of NOK 291 million and produced 200-man-years. The Svalbard society received NOK 380 million in public funding in 2008, which increased to 650 million in 2015.

== Education ==


Longyearbyen School serves ages 6–18. It is the northernmost primary and secondary school in the world. Once pupils reach ages 16 or 17 many families move to mainland Norway. There is a non-degree-offering tertiary educational institution in Longyearbyen, University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS), co-located with the Norwegian Polar Institute, Svalbard Museum, Svalbard Science Forum.

The Czech Arctic Research Station is also based in Longyearbyen and provides facilities for researchers and students not only from the Czech Republic but from all over the world.

==Transport==
Longyearbyen has a road network stretching , but the network does not extend to any other communities. In 2008 there were 1,481 registered road vehicles and 49 percent of all households had a car. Cars are registered with ZN registration plates. There is a single dealer who sells Toyotas, Svalbard Auto, which is also one of two businesses providing repairs.

Snowmobiles are a popular mode of transport, and there are more snowmobiles than residents. In 2008, there were registered 2,672 snowmobiles, and 69 per cent of households owned at least one in Longyearbyen. Off-road motorised transport is prohibited on bare ground, but snowmobiles are used extensively during winter—both for commercial and recreational activities. Transport from Longyearbyen to Barentsburg () and Pyramiden () is possible by snowmobile in winter, or by ship year round.

Svalbard Airport, Longyear is at Hotellneset, northwest of town. It has a long runway and is the only airport that is permitted to serve aircraft from the archipelago. Scandinavian Airlines operates daily flights to Oslo and Tromsø, and there are irregular flights to Russia. Lufttransport operates regular charter services to Svea Airport and Ny-Ålesund Airport, Hamnerabben. Arktikugol operates helicopters to Barentsburg and Pyramiden. There are two quays in Longyearbyen, one for the export of coal and one for general goods. From 1907 to 1987, the mining companies operated a network of aerial tramways to transport coal from the mines to the port. In the years 1907–1908 the then worldwide leading German wire ropeways company, Adolf Bleichert &amp; Co. from Lipsia, built a material cableway from mine 1 to the ship&#x27;s loading station, which was later supplemented by a cableway to mine 2. The remains of these wire ropeways and later successors to other mines are still visible today.

<text>Markus Johannes Wolf (19 January 1923 – 9 November 2006), also known as Mischa, was an East German spy who served as the head of the Main Directorate for Reconnaissance (), the foreign intelligence division of East Germany&#x27;s Ministry for State Security (, , commonly known as the ). He was the Stasi&#x27;s number two for 34 years, which spanned most of the Cold War. He is often regarded as one of the best-known spymasters during the Cold War. In the West he was known as &quot;the man without a face&quot; due to his elusiveness.

==Early life and education==

Wolf was born 19 January 1923, in Hechingen, Province of Hohenzollern (now Baden-Württemberg), to a German-Jewish father and a non-Jewish German mother. His father was the writer, communist activist and physician Friedrich Wolf (1888–1953) and his mother was the nursery teacher Else Wolf ( Dreibholz; 1898–1973). He had one brother, the film director Konrad Wolf (1925–1982). His father was a member of the Communist Party of Germany, and after the anti-communist and anti-Semitic Nazi Party gained power in 1933, Wolf emigrated to Moscow with his father, via Switzerland and France, because of their communist convictions and because Wolf&#x27;s father was Jewish.

During his exile, Wolf first attended the German Karl Liebknecht School and later a Russian school. In 1936, at the age of 13, he obtained Soviet identity documents. He was a citizen of Germany, the Soviet Union (USSR) and, later, East Germany (GDR).

==Career==

After finishing school, Wolf entered the Moscow Institute of Airplane Engineering (now Moscow Aviation Institute) in 1940, which was evacuated to Alma Ata after Nazi Germany&#x27;s attack on the Soviet Union. There he was told to join the Comintern in 1942, where he among others was prepared for undercover work behind enemy lines. He also worked as a newsreader for German People&#x27;s Radio after the dissolution of the Comintern, from 1943 until 1945.

After the war he was sent to Berlin with the Ulbricht Group, led by Walter Ulbricht, to work as a journalist for a radio station in the Soviet Zone of occupation. He was among those journalists who observed the entire Nuremberg trials against the principal Nazi leaders. Between 1949 and 1951 Wolf worked at the East German embassy in the Soviet Union. That same year he joined the Ministry for State Security (Stasi).

===HVA and MfS (Stasi)===

In December 1952, at the age of 29, Wolf was among the founding members of the foreign intelligence service within the Ministry for State Security. As intelligence chief, he achieved great success in penetrating the government, political and business circles of West Germany with spies. The most notable individual in this regard was Günter Guillaume, who was secretary to and close friend of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, and whose exposure as an East German agent led to Brandt&#x27;s resignation in 1974.

For most of his career in the HVA, Wolf was known as &quot;the man without a face&quot; due to his elusiveness. It was reported that Western agencies did not know the true appearance of the East German spy chief until 1978, when he was photographed by , Sweden&#x27;s National Security Service, during a visit to Stockholm, Sweden. An East German defector, Werner Stiller, then identified Wolf to West German counter-intelligence as the man in the picture. It has also been suggested that elements within the CIA had identified him by 1959 from photographs of attendees at the Nuremberg trials.

===Support for terrorism===
Until 1986, Wolf was responsible for Department III which allegedly supported terrorism in what the GDR considered the non-socialist economic area (NSW) (), which were countries that were not a member of Comecon, especially in the Arab world and had all information about terrorism sent directly to him. Terrorists who received training from Stasi at training camps in the GDR were from countries which were supportive of the GDR including Nicaragua, Angola, Mozambique, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Ethiopia, South Yemen and Palestinians and all of whom stored very large caches of arms and explosives at their embassies in the GDR. 

Although the GDR provided direct support to these main countries, the Soviet Union&#x27;s KGB required Wolf&#x27;s Stasi to coordinate its efforts with the KGB and beginning in the 1970s they worked together as equals using data from all the Eastern European intelligence services stored at a center in Moscow to unify all the information about international terrorism from all GDR and USSR friendly security services. Wolf&#x27;s Stasi trained the security brigade of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in counterintelligence and briefed PLO trainees about U.S. intelligence services and also protected terrorists from countries allied with the GDR from arrest through the Stasi&#x27;s monitoring of western intelligence services. 

While the Red Army Faction (RAF) conducted terrorism in West Germany, Wolf&#x27;s Stasi provided safe havens in GDR for the RAF. Wolf&#x27;s Stasi provided direct training to intelligence services from Nicaragua, Angola, Mozambique, South Yemen and Ethiopia. Although Wolf&#x27;s Stasi supported the pro Soviet Union Najibullah from Afghanistan during his stay in the GDR, all Afghan mujahideen organizations in West Germany that operated in Afghanistan during the Soviet Union&#x27;s War in Afghanistan were infiltrated and high ranking KGB officers controlled operations against mujahideen centers in West Germany because the Soviet intelligence services, including the GRU and the KGB, allegedly considered operations in Afghanistan too sensitive to trust to Wolf&#x27;s Stasi. 

Other terrorism related individuals, groups and events that Wolf&#x27;s Stasi directly supported include Yasser Arafat, who headed the PLO, George Habash, who headed the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Venezuelan Illich Ramirez Sanchez, whose code name was &quot;Separat&quot; but was known as &quot;Carlos the Jackal&quot; and often visited East Berlin and the GDR, the terrorists involved with the April 1986 La Belle discothèque bombing in West Berlin, Abu Nidal and Abu Daoud, who organized the Munich massacre during September 1972 at the Munich Olympics.

==Retirement==

Wolf retired in 1986 with the rank of Generaloberst, being succeeded by Werner Grossmann as head of the East German foreign intelligence service. He continued the work of his late brother Konrad in writing the story of their upbringing in Moscow in the 1930s. The book &quot;Troika&quot; came out on the same day in East and West Germany.

During the Peaceful Revolution, Wolf distanced himself from the hardline position taken by Erich Honecker, favouring reform. He spoke at the November 1989 Alexanderplatz demonstration, where he was both booed and applauded by a highly divided crowd during his speech. Calls to &quot;stop&quot; the speech, even to &quot;hang&quot; Wolf could be heard. The dissident Bärbel Bohley would later say: 

In September 1990, shortly before German reunification, Wolf fled the country, and sought political asylum in Russia and Austria. When denied, he returned to Germany, where he was arrested by German police. Wolf claimed to have refused an offer of a large amount of money, a new identity with plastic surgery to change his features, and a home in California from the Central Intelligence Agency to defect to the United States.

In 1993, he was convicted of treason by the Düsseldorf and sentenced to six years&#x27; imprisonment. This was later quashed by the German supreme court, because West Germany was a separate country at the time. In 1997, he was convicted of unlawful detention, coercion, and bodily harm, and was given a suspended sentence of two years&#x27; imprisonment. He was additionally sentenced to three days&#x27; imprisonment for refusing to testify against when the former West German (SPD) politician was accused in 1993 of atomic espionage. Wolf said that Flämig was not the agent that he had mentioned in his memoirs.

Markus Wolf died in his sleep at his Berlin home on 9 November 2006. He was cremated and buried in his brother&#x27;s grave in the &quot;Pergolenweg&quot; Ehrengrab section of Berlin&#x27;s Friedrichsfelde Cemetery.

In 2011, the State Social Court of Berlin-Brandenburg ruled that the widow Andrea Wolf was not entitled to a &quot;compensation pension&quot; that her husband had been stripped of as a &quot;fighter against fascism&quot;.

==Cultural impact==

John le Carré&#x27;s fictional spymaster Karla, a Russian, who appears in &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&quot;, &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot;, and &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; was believed by some readers to be modeled on Wolf. However, the writer has repeatedly denied it, and did so once again when interviewed on the occasion of Wolf&#x27;s death. Le Carré has also stated that it is &quot;sheer nonsense&quot; to claim that Wolf was the inspiration for the character Fiedler in &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;. Although Fiedler is a German Jew who spent World War II in exile and then gained a senior position in East Germany&#x27;s Intelligence Service, Carré said he had no idea who Markus Wolf was at the time of the writing of the book. He added that he considered Wolf to be the moral equivalent of Albert Speer. He maintained that a character&#x27;s code name &quot;Wolf&quot; in an early draft of the book was a coincidence and that the name came from the brand of his lawn mower. He renamed the character after being told that there was an actual &quot;Wolf&quot; in East German intelligence.

Conversely, Wolf stated that &quot;The Spy Who Came In From the Cold&quot; was the only book he read for a period in the early 1960s, and was surprised how accurately it presented the reality within the East German security services. He wondered if le Carré had had special information about the situation within the Ministry of State Security.

Wolf appears as a character in Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s novel &quot;The Deceiver&quot;. In the section titled &quot;Pride and Extreme Prejudice&quot;, a KGB officer liaises with East German intelligence while tracking down a British agent in East Germany. Forsyth also mentions Wolf in his earlier novel &quot;The Fourth Protocol&quot;, describing him, and the East German intelligence service as a whole, as masters of the false flag recruitment technique.
==Personal life==
Wolf was married three times. 

In 1944, he married his first wife Emmy Stenzer, the daughter of the German Communist Franz Stenzer, and who was the curator of the archives of Friedrich Wolf, Markus Wolf&#x27;s father. His second wife was Christa Heinrich and they were married from 1976 to 1986. His third wife was Andrea Stingl and they married in 1986. He had two daughters Tanja Trögel and Claudia Wall and a son .

Tanja Trögel continued her family passion supporting leftist activities. She is the director of the Friedrich Wolf Memorial in Lehnitz.

Claudia Wall (b. 1969 or 1970), a step daughter of Markus Wolf, was married from autumn 1997 until late 2008 to Hans Wall, the founder of an outdoor and street furniture firm Wall AG. She had two daughters Elisabeth (b. 1996 or 1997) from her first marriage and Johanna (b. 1997 or 1998) from her second marriage which was to Hans Wall.

Franz Wolf (b. May 1953, Berlin) is a Gibraltar-based manager of a network of companies owned by Mikhail Fridman.

<doc id="337411" wikidata="Q35703" url="?curid=337411" title="Gertrude B. Elion">
<text>Gertrude &quot;Trudy&quot; Belle Elion (January 23, 1918 – February 21, 1999) was an American biochemist and pharmacologist, who shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with George H. Hitchings and Sir James Black for their use of innovative methods of rational drug design for the development of new drugs. This new method focused on understanding the target of the drug rather than simply using trial-and-error. Her work led to the creation of the anti-retroviral drug AZT, which was the first drug widely used against AIDS. Her well known works also include the development of the first immunosuppressive drug, azathioprine, used to fight rejection in organ transplants, and the first successful antiviral drug, acyclovir (ACV), used in the treatment of herpes infection.

==Early life and education==
Elion was born in New York City on January 23, 1918, to parents Robert Elion, a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant and a dentist, and Bertha Cohen, a Polish Jewish immigrant. Her family lost their wealth after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Elion was an excellent student who graduated from Walton High School at the age of 15. When she was 15, her grandfather died of stomach cancer, and being with him during his last moments inspired Elion to pursue a career in science and medicine in college. She was Phi Beta Kappa at Hunter College, which she was able to attend for free due to her grades, graduating summa cum laude in 1937 with a degree in chemistry. Unable to find a paying research job after graduating because she was a woman, Elion worked as a secretary and high school teacher before working in an unpaid position at a chemistry lab. Eventually, she saved up enough money to attend New York University and she earned her M.Sc. in 1941, while working as a high school teacher during the day. In an interview after receiving her Nobel Prize, she stated that she believed the sole reason she was able to further her education as a young woman was because she was able to attend Hunter College for free. Her fifteen financial aid applications for graduate school were turned down due to gender bias, so she enrolled in a secretarial school, where she attended only six weeks before she found a job.

Unable to obtain a graduate research position, she worked as a food quality supervisor at A&amp;P supermarkets and for a food lab in New York, testing the acidity of pickles and the color of egg yolk going into mayonnaise. She moved to a position at Johnson &amp; Johnson that she hoped would be more promising, but ultimately involved testing the strength of sutures. In 1944, she left to work as an assistant to George H. Hitchings at the Burroughs-Wellcome pharmaceutical company (now GlaxoSmithKline) in Tuckahoe, New York. Hitchings was using a new way of developing drugs, by intentionally imitating natural compounds instead of through trial and error. Specifically, he was interested in synthesizing antagonists to nucleic acid derivatives, with the goal that these antagonists would integrate into biological pathways. He believed that if he could trick cancer cells into accepting artificial compounds for their growth, they could be destroyed without also destroying normal cells.Elion synthesized anti-metabolites of purines, and in 1950, she developed the anti-cancer drugs tioguanine and mercaptopurine.

She pursued graduate studies at night school at New York University Tandon School of Engineering (then Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute), but after several years of long-range commuting, she was informed that she would no longer be able to continue her doctorate on a part-time basis, but would need to give up her job and go to school full-time. Elion made a critical decision in her life, and stayed with her job and give up the pursuit of her doctorate. She never obtained a formal Ph.D., but was later awarded an honorary Ph.D. from New York University Tandon School of Engineering (then Polytechnic University of New York) in 1989 and an honorary S.D. degree from Harvard University in 1998.

== Personal life ==
Soon after graduating from Hunter College, Elion met Leonard Canter, an outstanding statistics student at City College of New York (CCNY). They planned to marry, but Leonard became ill. On June 25, 1941, he died from bacterial endocarditis, an infection of his heart valves. In her Nobel interview, she stated that this furthered her drive to become a research scientist and pharmacologist.

Elion never married or had children. However, her brother, whom she was close with, married and had three sons and a daughter that she took pride in being able to watch grow. She listed her hobbies as photography, travel, opera and ballet, and listening to music. After Burroughs Wellcome moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, Elion moved to nearby Chapel Hill. She retired in 1983 from Burroughs Wellcome to spend more time traveling and attending the opera. She continued to make important scientific contributions after her retirement. One of her passions during this time was encouraging other women to pursue careers in science.

Gertrude Elion died in North Carolina in 1999, aged 81.

== Career and research ==
While Elion had many jobs to support herself and put herself through school, Elion had also worked for the National Cancer Institute, American Association for Cancer Research, and World Health Organization, among other organizations. From 1967 to 1983, she was the head of the department of experimental therapy for Burroughs Wellcome. She officially retired from Burroughs and Wellcome in 1983.

She was affiliated with Duke University as adjunct professor of pharmacology and of experimental medicine from 1971 to 1983 and research professor from 1983 to 1999. During her time at Duke, she focused on mentoring medical and graduate students. She published more than 25 papers with the students she mentored at Duke.

Even after her retirement from Burroughs Wellcome, Gertrude continued almost full-time work at the lab. She played a significant role in the development of AZT, one of the first drugs used to treat HIV and AIDS. She also was crucial in the development of nelarabine, which she worked on until her death in 1999.

Rather than relying on trial and error, Elion and Hitchings discovered new drugs using rational drug design, which used the differences in biochemistry and metabolism between normal human cells and pathogens (disease-causing agents such as cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria, and viruses) to design drugs that could kill or inhibit the reproduction of particular pathogens without harming human cells. The drugs they developed are used to treat a variety of maladies, such as leukemia, malaria, lupus, hepatitis, arthritis, gout, organ transplant rejection (azathioprine), as well as herpes (acyclovir, which was the first selective and effective drug of its kind). Most of Elion&#x27;s early work came from the use and development of purine derivatives.
Elion&#x27;s research contributed to the development of:

* Mercaptopurine (Purinethol), the first treatment for leukemia, also used in organ transplantation.
* Azathioprine (Imuran), the first immuno-suppressive agent, used for organ transplants.
* Allopurinol (Zyloprim), for gout.
* Pyrimethamine (Daraprim), for malaria.
* Trimethoprim (Proloprim, Monoprim, others), for meningitis, sepsis, and bacterial infections of the urinary and respiratory tracts.
* Acyclovir (Zovirax), for viral herpes.
* Nelarabine for cancer treatment.
== Selected works by Gertrude B. Elion ==
* “Interaction of Anticancer Drugs with Enzymes.” In &quot;Pharmacological Basis of Cancer Chemotherapy&quot; (1975).
* 

==Awards and honors==
In 1988 Elion received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, together with Hitchings and Sir James Black for discoveries of &quot;important new principles of drug treatment&quot;. Elion was the fifth woman Nobel laureate in Medicine and the ninth in science in general, and one of only a handful of laureates without a doctoral degree. She was the only woman honored with a Nobel Prize that year. She was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1990, 
a member of the Institute of Medicine in 1991 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences also in 1991.

Her awards include the Garvan-Olin Medal (1968), the Sloan-Kettering Institute Judd Award (1983), the American Chemical Society Distinguished Chemist Award (1985), the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award (1989), the American Association for Cancer Research Cain Award (1985), the American Cancer Society Medal of Honor (1990), the National Medal of Science (1991), and the Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award (1997). In 1991 Elion became the first woman to be inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. She was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame also in 1991. In 1992, she was elected to the Engineering and Science Hall of Fame. She was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1995.

<doc id="337415" wikidata="Q110974" url="?curid=337415" title="James Black (pharmacologist)">
<text>Sir James Whyte Black (14 June 1924 – 22 March 2010) was a Scottish physician and pharmacologist. Together with Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings, he shared the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1988 for pioneering strategies for rational drug-design, which, in his case, led to the development of propranolol and cimetidine. Black established a Veterinary Physiology department at the University of Glasgow, where he became interested in the effects of adrenaline on the human heart. He went to work for ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958 and, while there, developed propranolol, a beta blocker used for the treatment of heart disease. Black was also responsible for the development of cimetidine, an H2 receptor antagonist, a drug used to treat stomach ulcers.

== Early life and education ==
Black was born on 14 June 1924 in Uddingston, Lanarkshire, the fourth of five sons of a Baptist family which traced its origins to Balquhidder, Perthshire. His father was a mining engineer. He was brought up in Fife, educated at Beath High School, Cowdenbeath, and, at the age of 15, won a scholarship to the University of St Andrews. His family had been too poor to send him to university and he had been persuaded to sit the St Andrews entrance exam by his maths teacher at Beath.

Until 1967, University College, Dundee was the site for all clinical medical activity for the University of St Andrews. He matriculated at University College (which eventually became the University of Dundee) in 1943 and graduated from University of St Andrews School of Medicine with an MB ChB in 1946.

After graduating, he stayed at University College to join the physiology department as an assistant lecturer before taking a lecturer position at King Edward VII College of Medicine in Singapore that later became part of the University of Malaya. Black had decided against a career as a medical practitioner as he objected to what he considered the insensitive treatment of patients at the time.

== Career ==
Black had large debts upon his graduation from university, so he took a teaching job in Singapore for three years, before moving to London in 1950 and then on to join the University of Glasgow (Veterinary School) where he established the Veterinary Physiology Department and developed an interest in the way adrenaline affects the human heart, particularly in those suffering from angina. Having formulated a theory of an approach by which the effects of adrenaline might be annulled, he joined ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958, remaining with the company until 1964, during which time he invented propranolol, which later became the world&#x27;s best-selling drug. During this time Black pioneered a method of research whereby drug molecules were purposefully built instead of being synthesised first and then investigated for their potential medical uses. The discovery of propranolol was hailed as the greatest breakthrough in the treatment of heart disease since the discovery of digitalis.

At the same time, Black was developing a similar method of inventing drugs for treatment of stomach ulcers, but ICI did not wish to pursue the idea so Black resigned in 1964 and joined Smith, Kline and French where he worked for nine years until 1973. While there, Black developed his second major drug, cimetidine, which was launched under the brand name Tagamet in 1975 and soon outsold propranolol to become the world&#x27;s largest-selling prescription drug.

Black was appointed professor, and head of department, of pharmacology at University College London in 1973 where he established a new undergraduate course in medicinal chemistry but he became frustrated by the lack of funding for research and accepted the post of director of therapeutic research at the Wellcome Research Laboratories in 1978. However he did not agree with his immediate boss there, Sir John Vane, and resigned in 1984. Black then became Professor of Analytical Pharmacology at the Rayne Institute of King&#x27;s College London medical school, where he remained until 1992. He established the James Black Foundation in 1988 with funding from Johnson &amp; Johnson and led a team of 25 scientists in drugs research, including work on gastrin inhibitors which can prevent some stomach cancers.

Black contributed to basic scientific and clinical knowledge in cardiology, both as a physician and as a basic scientist. His invention of propranolol, the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist that revolutionised the medical management of angina pectoris, is considered to be one of the most important contributions to clinical medicine and pharmacology of the 20th century. Propranolol has been described as the greatest breakthrough in heart disease treatments since the 18th century discovery of digitalis and has benefited millions of people. Black&#x27;s method of research, his discoveries about adrenergic pharmacology, and his clarification of the mechanisms of cardiac action are all strengths of his work.

He was greatly involved in the synthesis of cimetidine, at the time a revolutionary drug for the treatment and prevention of peptic ulcers. Cimetidine was the first of a new class of drugs, the H2-receptor antagonists.

=== Chancellor of the University of Dundee ===
In 1980, Black&#x27;s association with the University of Dundee was renewed when the institution recognised his many achievements by conferring him with the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws. In 1992 he accepted an offer to succeed the 16th Earl of Dalhousie as Chancellor of the University and was installed as Chancellor at the award ceremony held in Dundee Repertory Theatre on 29 April 1992. Appropriately the first degree he conferred was to Professor Robert Campbell Garry, who had been responsible for his original appointment at University College Dundee. Sir James remarked at this ceremony that by returning to Dundee he was &quot;in a real sense, coming home&quot;.

As Chancellor, Sir James Black did much to promote the University of Dundee and was a popular figure within the University. He was awarded a second honorary degree, that of Doctor of Science, in 2005. He retired from his post the following year, and his association with the University of Dundee was marked with launching of the £20 million Sir James Black Centre. The centre, intended to promote interdisciplinary research in the life sciences, was opened by Sydney Brenner in 2006. Sir James Black himself visited the centre in October 2006 and was reportedly excited and pleased by what he saw.

A portrait of Black in his chancellor&#x27;s robes, by Helene Train, is held as part of the University&#x27;s fine art collection. The portrait is currently displayed in the foyer of the Sir James Black Centre. 

== Honours and awards ==
Black was made a Knight Bachelor on 10 February 1981 for services to medical research, receiving the honour from the Queen at Buckingham Palace. On 26 May 2000 he was appointed to the Order of Merit, of which there are only 24 members at any one time, by Queen Elizabeth II.

Black was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1976 and the same year he was awarded the Lasker award. His certificate of election to the Royal Society reads: Has made outstanding contributions, based on fundamental considerations of receptor theory, to the development of new drugs of clinical importance. Introduced the first effective beta blockers and analysed their cardiovascular effects. These drugs have opened up new perspectives for the treatment of angina pectoris, cardiac irregularities and hypertension. More recently, in a concerted drive carried out with great vision, he has developed a new type of histamine antagonist capable of inhibiting gastric acid secretion induced by histamine or pentagastrin. Apart from its practical implications this work has considerable fundamental importance since it provided evidence for the existence of a new type of histamine receptor. This work has also provided experimental support for the hypothesis that endogenous histamine may be involved in the secretion of acid in the stomach. In 1979, he was awarded the Artois-Baillet Latour Health Prize. Black was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh in 1980. In 1982 Black was awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine, and the year after the Scheele Award. He was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine along with Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings for their work on drug development. In 1994 he received the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine and in 2004 the Royal Medal from the Royal Society. In 2008, he was Awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Medical Futures Innovation Awards, accompanied by his wife Professor Rona Mackie Black, in front of a distinguished audience of one thousand guests.

In the town of Lochgelly, Fife, there is a street called Sir James Black Gait.

On 23 November 2018, the University of Glasgow renamed the West Medical Building in honour of Black. Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Glasgow, said: “Sir James was undoubtedly one of the greatest scientists of the modern age. Through his commitment, intellect and insight he achieved a global impact and his discoveries continue to improve the lives of many.” The unveiling of a plaque was attended by Sir James Black’s wife, Professor Rona Mackie Black, Emeritus Professor and Senior Research Fellow in Public Health within the University&#x27;s Institute of Health and Wellbeing.

James Black Place at Ninewells Hospital is named in his honour.

==Personal life==
Black met Hilary Joan Vaughan (1924–1986) at a university ball in 1944 and the couple married in 1946 upon his graduation. He described her as the &quot;mainspring&quot; of his life until she died aged 61 in Surrey. The couple had a daughter, Stephanie, born in 1951. Black remarried in 1994, to Professor Rona MacKie. Black was a very private man who was averse to publicity and was horrified to discover he had won the Nobel Prize.

Black died, aged 85, on the morning of 22 March 2010 after a long illness. His death was announced by the University of Dundee, where Black served as Chancellor from 1992 to 2006. His funeral was held on 29 March at St. Columba&#x27;s Church, London. He is buried at the Ardclach cemetery, a parish established in 1655, near Nairn, Scotland. Upon hearing of Black&#x27;s death, Professor Pete Downes, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dundee said Black &quot;was a great scientist, but he was also a great man to know&quot; while the BBC said he was &quot;hailed as one of the great Scottish scientists of the 20th Century&quot;. He was described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as the man who earned the most for the pharmaceutical industry through his drug development, though he received little personal financial gain from his work.

Shortly after his death the Bute Medical School of the University of St Andrews, where Black had studied for his initial degree in medicine, announced that an honorary &#x27;Sir James Black Chair of Medicine&#x27; would be created. In September 2010 the first Chair of Medicine at the University was given to Professor Stephen H Gillespie MD, DSc, FRCP (Edin), FRC Path, who left his post as Professor of Medical Microbiology at UCL.

<doc id="337416" wikidata="Q44370" url="?curid=337416" title="Eephus pitch">
<text>An eephus pitch (also spelled ephus) in baseball is a very high-arcing off-speed pitch. The delivery from the pitcher has very low velocity and often catches the hitter off-guard. The eephus pitch is thrown overhand like most pitches, but is characterized by an unusual, high-arcing trajectory. The corresponding slow velocity bears more resemblance to a slow-pitch softball delivery than to a traditional baseball pitch. It is considered a trick pitch because, in comparison to normal baseball pitches, which run from , an eephus pitch appears to move in slow motion at or less, sometimes as low as 35 mph ().

Its invention is attributed to Rip Sewell of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1940s, although according to historians John Thorn and John Holway, the first pitcher to throw a big blooper pitch was Bill Phillips, who played in the National League on and off from 1890 through 1903. The practice then lay dormant for nearly 40 years until Sewell resurrected it. According to manager Frankie Frisch, the pitch was named by outfielder Maurice Van Robays. When asked what it meant, Van Robays replied, &quot;&#x27;Eephus ain&#x27;t nothing, and that&#x27;s a nothing pitch.&quot; Although the origin is not known for certain, &quot;eephus&quot; may come from the Hebrew word (pronounced ), meaning &quot;zero&quot;.

== Development and use in Major League Baseball ==
Sewell&#x27;s earliest recorded use of the pitch came in a game against the Boston Braves at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh on June 1, 1943, although as early as the spring training season of 1942 Sewell may have been experimenting with the pitch. Sewell went on to win 20 games with the pitch in 1943.

After appearing in over 300 major-league games, Rip Sewell gave up only one career home run off the eephus, to Ted Williams in the 1946 MLB All-Star Game. Williams challenged Sewell to throw the eephus. Sewell obliged, and Williams fouled off the pitch. However, Sewell then announced that he was going to throw the pitch again, and Williams clobbered it for a home run. When describing the mechanics of the pitch and why he was able to succeed where others had failed, Williams remarked &quot;A little girl could hit that pitch, but you had to provide all the power yourself.&quot; Years later, however, Williams admitted that he had been running towards the pitcher&#x27;s mound as he hit the ball, and photographs reveal that he was in fact a few feet in front of the batter&#x27;s box when he made contact. Since under Rule 6.06(a) of the Official Baseball Rules, a batter is out for illegal action when he hits a ball with one or both feet on the ground entirely outside the batter&#x27;s box, Williams could have been ruled out had it been spotted by the home plate umpire.

Bill &quot;Spaceman&quot; Lee threw an eephus referred to as the &quot;Leephus&quot;, &quot;spaceball&quot; or &quot;moon ball&quot;. Pitching for the Boston Red Sox against the Cincinnati Reds in Game 7 of the 1975 World Series, the Red Sox were up 3–0 when, on a 1–0 count, Lee threw an eephus pitch to Tony Pérez with a runner on base. The pitch resulted in a towering two-run home run over the Green Monster that Lee often said afterward &quot;is still rising&quot;. The Red Sox went on to lose the game, 4–3, costing them the chance for their first World Series championship since 1918.

Utility player Brock Holt used a few eephus pitches during a relief appearance for the Texas Rangers on August 7, 2021, one registering the slowest MLB pitch for a called strike since at least 2008 (the pitch-tracking era) at .

Other pitchers known to have employed the eephus pitch include: Fernando Abad (the &quot;super changeup&quot;), Al McBean (the McBean ball), Luis Tiant, Pedro Borbón, Yu Darvish, Casey Fossum (called the &quot;Fossum Flip&quot;), Steve Hamilton (the folly floater), Liván Hernández, Phil Niekro, Orlando Hernández, Dave LaRoche (LaLob), Carlos Zambrano, Vicente Padilla (dubbed the &quot;soap bubble&quot; by Vin Scully), Satchel Paige, Pascual Pérez (the Pascual Pitch), Kazuhito Tadano, Bob Tewksbury, Carlos Villanueva, Alfredo Simón, Clayton Kershaw, Rich Hill, Zack Greinke and unique wind-mill windup 1930s to 1950s pitcher Bobo Newsom.

The eephus pitch has also been employed by various position players on the rare occasion that they take the mound. Examples include Chicago Cubs catcher Tucker Barnhart, who threw a 39-mph eephus pitch for a strike during a one-inning appearance to close the game against the Boston Red Sox on July 16, 2023, and threw only six pitches — all of them eephus pitches, ranging from 34 to 42 mph—for a single and three outs when he pitched the ninth inning of the Cubs&#x27; 8–0 loss to the Atlanta Braves on August 4, 2023.

Other nicknames for the eephus pitch include the balloon ball, blooper ball, gondola, parachute, rainbow pitch—distinct from the rainbow curve—gravity curve, The Monty Brewster (a reference to the titular character in &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot;), and the Bugs Bunny curve, a reference to the 1946 Bugs Bunny cartoon &quot;Baseball Bugs&quot; in which several batters in a row swing and miss at a very slow pitch before the ball reaches the plate.

The eephus is sometimes used as part of strategy to confuse batters. On September 20, 2022, Philadelphia Phillies position player Garrett Stubbs, on a rare pitching assignment, used a series of four eephus pitches to put Toronto Blue Jays catcher Danny Jansen behind in the count. The last Stubbs eephus registered 36.9 mph and his next pitch was an 83.8 mph fastball which earned a strikeout against the unready Jansen, who saw four consecutive pitches at slow speeds before the faster pitch that struck him out.

<doc id="337417" wikidata="Q2157144" url="?curid=337417" title="Almere Haven">
<text>Almere Haven is the oldest borough of Almere (although the first houses of Almere were built in the neighborhood now known as Oostvaardersdiep in Almere Buiten). Although Almere Haven does not have its own railway station, it is well-connected to Amsterdam and the rest of Almere by a good bus rapid transit system.

Almere Haven has a small harbour, as well as a marina and is surrounded by large forests of poplars containing buzzards, foxes, small deer, and owls. The closest forests are Beginbos and Waterlandsebos.

Almere Haven features a mall that, for the most part, closely resembles the downtown area of a small town. Along the moat called Kerkgracht (inside the mall), it also features canal houses, which resemble old canal houses found in Downtown Amsterdam. This was done to make the first citizens (in 1975) feel at home, as they were people who had previously lived in Amsterdam.

The first permanent building inside the mall was the multifunctional building De Roef, which closed down a long time ago. The building is still actively used; currently it is home to a Vögele Mode store.

The first permanent school of Almere (Haven) was built in 1978 in the neighborhood De Werven. Its name was &quot;De Bijenkorf&quot;. As more schools were built in Almere and younger people and families settled in other parts of the city, De Bijenkorf became less important and eventually ended up with just a handful of teachers. Therefore, it was up for closure. However, instead of closing, the building burned down in December 1993 because people threw firecrackers through the mailbox. The police found out who those people were, but they never prosecuted them. The building was never restored. No trace of the building remains today because in the early 2000s, houses were built on top of the former school site.

The first neighborhood of Almere Haven is De Werven. Among other houses and other things, it features a lot of greenery, a big park called Stadswerfpark, a sports center with an external playground (&quot;Playground Stadswerfpark&quot;) specifically for sports (like a soccer field and basketball court) and a public pool building. It also features a big supervised playground called De Speelhaven.

Almere Haven features the most idealistic architecture in Almere, when the goal was to build a model city on the newly reclaimed land of Flevoland. The city was planned before increasing population pressure in Almere and rising property prices caused compromises on the original vision.

Almost all housing developments are built to provide views of greenery and open spaces, and each group of houses is clustered around a little park (although this concept has changed in newer areas), usually with easy access to the surrounding forests, so most residents of Almere Haven do not have the sense of living in a crowded urban area.

The urban area of Almere Haven does not have the inconveniences of busy traffic, car pollution, and road noise because all roads are cul-de-sacs connecting to a well-hidden ring road that provides the only car access in and out of Almere Haven, although there are sometimes traffic jams in rush hours on said ring roads (especially on the ring road Noorderdreef). The bus rapid transit system contains a large loop throughout the borough with a bus stop in almost every neighborhood.

<text>Basemath (, Arabic: بسمة; &quot;Sweet-smile&quot;), in the Hebrew Bible, is the name of two different wives of Esau. See Wives of Esau.

In , Basemath is the name of the first wife of Esau. She was the daughter of Elon the Hittite (). Because Basemath was a Canaanite, Esau’s marriage to Basemath (as well as to his second wife, Judith) ignored God&#x27;s wishes that Abraham’s descendants keep themselves separate from the Canaanites in marriage. Esau’s marriage to Basemath, therefore, brought bitterness to Isaac and Rebekah. Esau is then said to have taken as his third wife a daughter of his uncle Ishmael, Mahalath.

In , on the other hand, Esau&#x27;s three wives are differently named; his family is mentioned as composed of two Canaanite wives, Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah, and a third: &quot;Bashemath&quot;, Ishmael&#x27;s daughter. 

Some scholars equate the three wives mentioned in Genesis 26 and 28 with those in Genesis 36, the following way:

* Basemath () = Adah (), the daughter of Elon the Hittite;
* Judith () = Aholibamah (), also a Canaanite;
* Mahalath () = &quot;Bashemath&quot; (), Esau&#x27;s cousin and third wife, daughter of Ishmael.

* In , Basemath is also the name of a daughter of King Solomon.

<text>Studio glass is the modern use of glass as an artistic medium to produce sculptures or three-dimensional artworks in the fine arts. The glass objects created are intended to make a sculptural or decorative statement, and typically serve no useful function. Though usage varies, the term is properly restricted to glass made as art in small workshops, typically with the personal involvement of the artist who designed the piece. This is in contrast to art glass, made by craftsmen in factories, and glass art, covering the whole range of glass with artistic interest made throughout history. Both art glass and studio glass originate in the 19th century, and the terms compare with studio pottery and art pottery, but in glass the term &quot;studio glass&quot; is mostly used for work made in the period beginning in the 1960s with a major revival in interest in artistic glassmaking.

Pieces are often unique, or made in a small limited edition. Their prices may range from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands of dollars (US). For the largest installations, the prices are in the millions.

Modern glass studios use a great variety of techniques in creating glass artworks, including:
* Glassblowing,
* Flameworking,
* Glass casting,
* Coldworking,
* Glass fusing,
* Pâte de verre,
* Stained glass.

==History==

From the 19th century, various types of fancy glass started to become significant branches of the decorative arts. Cameo glass was revived for the first time since the Romans, initially mostly used for pieces in a neo-classical style. The Art Nouveau movement in particular made great use of glass, with René Lalique, Émile Gallé, and Daum of Nancy important names in the first French wave of the movement, producing colored vases and similar pieces, often in cameo glass, and also using lustre techniques. Louis Comfort Tiffany in America specialized in secular stained glass, mostly of plant subjects, both in panels and his famous lamps. From the 20th century, some glass artists began to class themselves as sculptors working in glass and as part of the fine arts.

In the early 20th century, most glass production happened in factories. Even individual glassblowers making their own personalized designs would do their work in those large shared buildings. The idea of &quot;art glass&quot; grew – small decorative works in small production runs, often with designs or objects inside.

By the 1970s, there were good designs for smaller furnaces, and in the United States this gave rise to the &quot;studio glass&quot; movement of glassblowers, who worked outside of factories, often in their own buildings or studios. This coincided with a move towards smaller production runs of particular styles. This movement spread to other parts of the world as well.

===Techniques used in modern studios===
Modern glass studios use a great variety of techniques in creating their pieces. The ancient technique of blown glass, where a glassblower works at a furnace full of molten glass using metal rods and hand tools to blow and shape almost any form of glass, is one of the more popular ways to work. Most large hollow pieces are made this way, and it allows the artist to be improvisational as they create their work.

Another type is flame-worked glass, which uses torches and kilns in its production. The artist generally works at a bench using rods and tubes of glass, shaping with hand tools to create their work. Many forms can be achieved this way with little investment into money and space. Though the artist is somewhat limited in the size of the work that can be created, a great level of detail can be achieved with this technique. The paperweights by Paul Stankard are good examples of what can be achieved with flame-working techniques. In the 21st century, flame-worked glass became commonly used as adornments on functional items. The glass conductor&#x27;s baton, commissioned by Chandler Bridges for Dr. Andre Thomas, is a clear example of flame-working being used to transform a traditional item into an artistic statement.

Cast glass can be done at the furnace, at the torch or in a kiln. Generally the artist makes a mold out of refractory, sand, or plaster and silica which can be filled with either clear glass or colored or patterned glass, depending on the techniques and effects desired. Large scale sculpture is usually created this way. Slumped glass and fused glass is similar to cast glass, but it is not done at as high of a temperature. Usually the glass is only heated enough to impress a shape or a texture onto the piece, or to stick several pieces of glass together without a glue.

The traditional technique of stained glass is still employed for the creation of studio glass. The artist cuts the glass into shapes and sets the pieces into lead cames which are soldered together. They artist can also use hot techniques in a kiln to create texture, patterns, or change the overall shape of the glass.

Etched glass is created by dipping glass that has an acid resistant pattern applied to its surface into an acid solution. Also an artist can engrave it by hand using wheels. Sandblasting can create a similar effect.

Cold glass is any glass worked without the use of heat. Glass may be cut, chiseled, sandblasted, and glued or bonded to form art objects ranging from small pieces to monumental sculpture.

== The studio glass movement ==
The international studio glass movement originated in America, spreading to Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and Asia. The emphasis of this movement was on the artist as the designer and maker of one-of-a-kind objects, in a small studio environment. This movement enabled the sharing of technical knowledge and ideas among artists and designers that, in industry, would not be possible.

With the dominance of Modernism in the arts, there was a broadening of artistic media throughout the 20th century. Indeed, glass was part of the curriculum at art schools such as the Bauhaus. Frank Lloyd Wright produced glass windows considered by some as masterpieces not only of design, but of painterly composition as well. During the 1950s, studio ceramics and other craft media in the U.S. began to gain in popularity and importance, and American artists interested in glass looked for new paths outside industry. Harvey Littleton, often referred to as the &quot;Father of the Studio Glass Movement&quot;, was inspired to develop studio glassblowing in America by the great glass being designed and made in Italy, Sweden and many other places, and by the pioneering work in ceramics of the California potter Peter Voulkos. Harvey Littleton and Dominick Labino held the now-famous glass workshop at the Toledo Museum of Art in 1962. The goal was to melt glass in a small furnace so individual artists could use glass as an art medium in a non-industrial setting. This was the workshop that would stimulate the studio glass movement that spread around the world. Instead of the large, industrial settings of the past, a glass artist could now work with a small glass furnace in an individual setting and produce art from glass.

==Modern regional glass art==

===Australia===

The early glass movement (studio glass) in Australia was spurred on by a visit to Australia by American artist Bill Boysen, who toured the country in the early seventies with a mobile studio. Boysen traveled to Australia in 1974, where he promoted glass artistry by presenting a &quot;revolutionary demonstration of glass blowing&quot; to a gathering of around 250 attendees. Boysen&#x27;s mobile studio &quot;successfully toured eight eastern states’ venues in ’74, thus greatly enhancing the credibility of hand crafted glass.&quot; Boysen&#x27;s visit is credited with helping &quot;inspire a generation of [Australian] artists to work with glass and eventually led to the creation of the national glass art collection&quot; in Wagga Wagga, Australia. This important collection includes over 450 works of art and is &quot;the most comprehensive public collection of Australian studio glass anywhere.&quot; Since that time Australian glass has gained worldwide recognition with Adelaide in South Australia, hosting the International Glass Art Society Conference in 2005 on only its third occasion outside of the U.S. The Ranamok Glass Prize, presented every year from 1994 to 2014, promotes contemporary glass artists living in Australia and New Zealand.

===Belgium===
Daniël Theys en Chris Miseur from the glass factory Theys &amp; Miseur in , Belgium, which represent Belgian artistic glass work concerning the entire world. In 2015, John Moran (winner of Blown Away Season 3) co-founded Gent Glas, a public glass studio focused on introducing glass as an artistic medium to the general public. The studio has gone on to invite over 40 visiting artists from 13 different countries.

===China===
Although China has a very long tradion of glass art, studio glass was arguably first made by Loretta H. Yang and Chang Yi in 1987 at the first contemporary Chinese liuli art studio Liuligongfang. In 1997, Yang and Chang released their technique and procedure to the public. The Liuligongfang technique has since become a key cornerstone upon which contemporary Chinese liuli is built with Yang and Chang widely recognized as the pioneers and founders of contemporary Chinese liuli.

===Italy===
Glass blowing began in the Roman Empire, and Italy has refined the techniques of glass blowing ever since. Until the very recent explosion of glass shops in Seattle (US), there were more on the Island of Murano (Italy) than anywhere else in world. The majority of the refined artistic techniques of glassblowing (e.g., incalmo, reticello, zanfirico, latticino) were developed there. Moreover, generations of blowers passed on their techniques to family members. Boys would begin working at the &quot;fornace&quot; (actually &quot;furnace&quot;—called &quot;the factory&quot; in English).

===Japan===
Japanese glass art which was inspired by the studio glass movement of the 1960s has a short history. The first independent glass studios of this period were built by Saburo Funakoshi and Makoto Ito, and Shinzo Kotani in separate places. Yoshihiko Takahashi and Hiroshi Yamano show their works at galleries throughout the world and are arguably Japan&#x27;s glass artists of note. Yoichi Ohira has worked with great success in Murano with Italian gaffers. The small Pacific island Niijima, administered by Tokyo, has a renowned glass art center, built and run by Osamu and Yumiko Noda, graduates of Illinois State University, where they studied with Joel Philip Myers. Every autumn, the Niijima International Glass Art Festival takes place inviting top international glass artists for demonstrations and seminars. Emerging glass artists, such as Yukako Kojima and Tomoe Shizumu, were featured at the 2007 Glass Art Society exhibition space at the Pittsburgh Glass Center. Toshichi Iwata and Kyohei Fujita were noteworthy Japanese studio glass artists who worked before and after the studio glass movement of the 1960s. Both were active studio glass artists by the late 1940s. Fujita got his start working in the production part of Toshichi Iwata&#x27;s studio which was founded in 1947.

===Mexico===
Mexico was the first country in Latin America to have a glass factory in the early sixteenth century brought by the Spanish conquerors. Although traditional glass in Mexico has prevailed over modern glass art, since the 1970s there have been a List of glass artists#Mexico that have given a place to that country in international glass art.

===The Netherlands===
Glass art in the Netherlands is mainly stimulated by the glass designing and glass blowing factory Royal Leerdam Crystal. Such notable designers as H.P. Berlage, Andries Copier and Sybren Valkema, Willem Heesen (Master Glassblower as well) had a major influence on Dutch glass art. Later the studio glass movement, inspired by the American Harvey Littleton and the new Workgroup Glass founded by Sybren Valkema at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam led to a new generation of glass artists.

=== United Kingdom ===
Notable centres of glass production in the UK have been St. Helens in Merseyside (the home of Pilkington Glass and the site on which lead crystal glass was first produced by George Ravenscroft), Stourbridge in the Midlands and Sunderland in the North East. Sunderland is now home to the National Glass Centre which houses a specialist glass art course. St. Helens boasts a similar establishment but without the educational body attached. Perthshire in Scotland was known internationally for its glass paperweights. It has always hosted the best glass artists working on small scales, but closed its factory in Crieff, Scotland in January 2002.

Glass artists in the UK have a variety of exhibitions. The Scottish Glass Society hosts a yearly exhibition for members, the Guild of Glass Engravers exhibit every two years and the British Glass Biennale, begun in 2004 is now opening its third show.

British Glass Art owes much to the long history of craft. The majority of its glass blowers who operate small studio furnaces produce aesthetically beautiful though primarily functional objects. Technical skill as a blower is given as much importance as the artistic intent.

The Glasshouse, one of the first artist run UK studios, was established in 1967. Artists such as Jane Bruce, Steven Newell, Catherine Hough, Annette Meech, Christopher Williams and Simon Moore spent time working there until it closed its doors in the late 1990&#x27;s.

There are now a growing number of glass studios in the UK. Many specialize in production glassware while others concentrate on one off or limited edition pieces. An Arts Council funded, non-profit making organisation, the Contemporary Glass Society, founded in 1976 as &quot;British Artists in Glass&quot;, exists to promote and support the work of glass artists in the UK.

Other glass organisations in the UK are The Guild of Glass Engravers, the Scottish Glass Society and Cohesion. Cohesion is a different sort of entity to the other organisations in that it was specifically founded to promote and develop glass art as a commercial concern. It organises trade events in and around the UK and at the international level. Originally it focused only on artists based the north east of England but has since expanded its remit to cover the whole of the UK.

An internationally renown center for glass, NorthLands Creative Glass, was established in late 1990s in the far north of Scotland by Dan Klein, Ian &amp; Bunty Gunn and Robert McClennan as a center of excellence for the exploration of glass. It offered residencies and masterclasses to arts students and established artists both within and outside of the glass field. Sadly, after 27 years, in 2023, NorthLands Creative Glass permanently closed its doors.

In November 2007 the glass sculpture &quot;Model for a Hotel&quot; was unveiled as an exhibit on the fourth plinth of Trafalgar Square, London.

===United States===

The United States has had two phases of development in glass. The first, in the early and mid-1900s, started in the cities of Toledo, Ohio, and Corning, New York, where factories such as Fenton and Steuben were making both functional and artistic glass pieces. Toledo&#x27;s rich history in glass goes back to the turn of the century when Libbey Glass, Owens-Illinois and Johns Manville led the world in the manufacturing of glass products. Their reputations earned Toledo the title of the &quot;Glass Capital of the World.&quot; These industry leaders, along with the Toledo Museum of Art, sponsored the first glass workshop in 1961. This workshop would lead to a new movement in American studio glass.
====The American Studio Glass Movement====
The second, and most prominent, phase in American glass began in 1962, when then-ceramics professor Harvey Littleton and chemist Dominick Labino began the contemporary glassblowing movement. The impetus for the movement consisted of their two workshops at the Toledo Museum of Art, during which they began experimenting with melting glass in a small furnace and creating blown glass art. Littleton and Labino were the first to make molten glass feasible for artists in private studios. Harvey Littleton extended his influence through his own important artistic contributions and through his teaching and training, including many of the most important contemporary glass artists, including Marvin Lipofsky, Sam Herman (Britain), Fritz Dreisbach and Dale Chihuly.

In 1964, Tom McGlauchlin started one of the first accredited glass programs at the University of Iowa, and Marvin Lipofsky founded the university-level glass program at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1964, Dr. Robert C. Fritz founded a university-level glass program at San Jose State University in San Jose, California. As a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under Harvey Littleton, Bill H. Boysen built the first glass studio at Penland School of Crafts, in Penland, North Carolina, in 1965. After graduating in 1966, he started the graduate glass program at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, Illinois. Dale Chihuly initiated the glass program at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1969. Tom McGlauchlin joined the Toledo Museum of Art as Professor and Director of Glass in conjunction with the University of Toledo&#x27;s Art program in 1971.

====American Glass Schools and Studios====

The growth of studio glass led to the formation of glass schools and art studios located across the country. The largest concentrations of glass artists are located in Seattle, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles/Orange County and Corning, New York also have sizable concentrations of artists working in glass.

The Pilchuck Glass School near Seattle has become a mecca for glass artists from all over the world. Those who attend Pilchuck, either college students or established artists, have the opportunity to attend master classes and exchange skills and information in an environment dedicated solely to glass based arts.

Pittsburgh Glass Center in Pittsburgh has residency programs for artists working in glass, as well as a facility for artists to make use of for their works. Pittsburgh Glass Center offers classes to the public on glassblowing and many other forms of glass art. Philadelphia hosts a small array of glass studios for artists that use glass. Home to the National Liberty Museum (featuring all exhibits by international glass artists), Philadelphia hosts the non-profit P.I.P.E. program, with residencies for artists that use glass as well as metal, electroforming on glass, and bronze casting. The state of Pennsylvania has a long tradition of the production of industrial glass and its influence has quickly been absorbed by artists working in glass.

The Studio of The Corning Museum of Glass, established in 1996, is an internationally renowned teaching facility in Corning, NY. Classes and workshops are held for new and experienced glassworkers and artists. The Studio&#x27;s residency program brings artists from around the world to Corning for a month to work in The Studio facilities, where they can explore and develop new glassblowing techniques or expand on their current bodies of work; recipients of the Specialty Glass Residency include Beth Lipman, Mark Peiser, Karen LaMonte, and Anna Mlasowsky. Artists working in The Studio have access to the collections of The Corning Museum of Glass, and benefit from the resources of the Rakow Research Library, whose holdings cover the art and history of glass and glassmaking.

Wheaton Arts and Cultural Center, located in the historic glass industry capital of Millville, New Jersey, is a nonprofit art and history education center that is home to the Museum of American Glass, which houses the largest collection of American glass objects in the world. The collection includes historical glass as well as contemporary work from some of the glass world&#x27;s biggest names. In addition to the museum, WheatonArts operates a world-class glass studio under the creative direction of Hank Murta Adams. The Creative Glass Center of America, which is funded by WheatonArts and crucial to its mission of continuing Millville&#x27;s legacy in the glass world, hosts a fellowship program exclusively for up-and-coming and mid-career artists working in glass. Well-known alumnae of the CGCA fellowship include Steve Tobin (1983) Kait Rhoads (1997 and 2008), Lino Tagliapietra (1989), Beth Lipman (2001), Gregory Nangle (2006), Deborah Czeresko (2006 and 2010), Angus Powers (2003), and Stephen Paul Day (1992, 1997, 2004, and 2009).

San Jose State University glass program was started by Dr. Robert Fritz in 1964 and is the oldest educational studio glass program in California. Dr. Fritz died suddenly in 1986 and Mary B. White ran the program from 1986 to 2005.

==Techniques and processes==

=== Stained glass ===

Stained glass, such as the windows that are seen in churches, are windows that contain an element of painting in them. The window is designed. After the glass has been cut to shape, paint that contains ground glass is applied, so that, when it is fired in a kiln, the paint fuses onto the glass surface. Following this process, the sections of glass are placed together and held in place with lead came that is then soldered at the joints.

Leadlights and stained glass are manufactured in the same way, but leadlights do not contain any sections of glass that have been painted.

=== Blown glass ===
Glassblowing is one of the most used technique for creating &quot;art glass&quot; and is still favoured by most of today&#x27;s studio glass artists. This is because of the artist&#x27;s intimacy with the material, and an almost infinite opportunity for creativity and variation at almost every stage of the process. Glassblowing can be used to create a multitude of shapes and can incorporate color through a wide range of techniques. Coloured glass can be gathered out of a crucible, clear glass can be rolled in powdered colored glass to coat the outside of a bubble, it can be rolled in chips of glass, it can be stretched into rods and incorporated through caneworking, or it can be layered, cut and fused into tiles, and incorporated into a bubble of glass for intricate patterns through murrine. &quot;Blown glass&quot; refers only to individually hand-made items but can include the use of moulds for shaping, ribbing, and spiking to produce decorative bubbles. Glass blown articles must be made of compatible glass or the stress in the piece will cause a failure.

===Lampworking===
Similar to glassblowing, Lampworking (also called &quot;flameworking&quot; or &quot;torchworking&quot;) is a style in which the artist manipulates glass with the use of a torch – rather than a blowpipe or blow tube – on a smaller scale. Once in a molten state, the glass is formed by blowing and shaping with tools and hand movements. Though typical lampworking art takes the form of beads, figurines, marbles, small vessels, Christmas tree ornaments, and other such things, it is also used to create scientific instruments as well as glass models of animals and botanical subjects.

=== Kiln-formed glass ===

Kiln formed glass is usually referred to as &quot;warm glass&quot;, and can be either made up from a single piece of glass that is slumped into or over a mould or different colours and sheets of glass fused together. The process of hot glass is highly scientific in that the types of glass and temperatures that they must be fired at is quite complicated operation to undertake correctly. Art glass that is kiln formed usually take the form of dishes, plates or tiles. Glass that is fused in a kiln must be of the same co-efficient of expansion (CoE). If glass that does not have the same CoE is used for fusing, the differing rates of contraction will cause minute stress fractures to form and, over time, these fractures will cause a piece to crack. The use of polarizing filters to inspect the work will determine if stress fractures are present.

===Cold glass===
Cold glass is worked by any method that does not use heat. Processes include sandblasting, cutting, sawing, chiseling, bonding and gluing.

==== Sandblasting ====
Glass can be decorated by sandblasting the surface of a piece in order to remove a layer of glass, thereby making a design stand out. Items that are sandblasted are usually thick slabs of glass into which a design has been carved by means of high pressure sandblasting. This technique provides a three-dimensional effect but is not suitable for toughened glass as the process could shatter it.

=== Copperfoil technique ===
The technique of using copperfoil is mainly used in the construction of smaller pieces such as Tiffany style lamps, and it was, in fact, frequently used by Louis Comfort Tiffany. It consists of wrapping cut sections of glass in a self-adhesive tape that is made out of thin copper foil. This technique requires a great deal of dexterity and is also very time-consuming. After the sections have been foiled, they are soldered together in order to form the item.

<text>Mahalath was, according to the Bible, the third wife of Esau, daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth. Esau took Mahalath from the house of Ishmael to be his wife, after seeing that his Canaanite wives (Basemath and Judith) displeased his father, Isaac ().

Esau sought this union with a non-Canaanite, in an effort to reconcile his relationship with his parents, namely with his father Isaac whose blessing he sought (). However, there is no record of his parents&#x27; approval for the union of Esau and Mahalath. She bore a son, Reuel, to Esau. ()

In , on the other hand, Esau&#x27;s three wives are differently named; his family is mentioned as consisting of two Canaanite wives, Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah, and a third: Bashemath, Ishmael&#x27;s daughter. Some scholars equate the three wives mentioned in Genesis 26 and 28 with those mentioned in Genesis 36, in the following way:
* Basemath () = Adah (), the daughter of Elon the Hittite;
* Judith () = Aholibamah (), also a Canaanite;
* Mahalath () = Bashemath (), Esau&#x27;s cousin and third wife, daughter of Ishmael
Nonetheless, other scholars dispute these connections. See Wives of Esau.

<doc id="337426" wikidata="Q1248126" url="?curid=337426" title="The $64,000 Question">
<text>The $64,000 Question is an American game show broadcast in primetime on CBS-TV from 1955 to 1958, which became embroiled in the 1950s quiz show scandals. Contestants answered general knowledge questions, earning money which doubled as the questions became more difficult. The final question had a top prize of $64,000 (), hence the &quot;$64,000 Question&quot; in the show&#x27;s title.

The $64,000 Challenge (1956–1958) was its spin-off show, where contestants played against winners of at least $8,000 on &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot;.

==Origins==

&quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; was largely inspired by the earlier CBS and NBC radio program &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot;, which ran on CBS radio from 1940 to 1947, and then on NBC radio from 1947 to 1952. After 1950, the radio show was renamed &quot;The $64 Question&quot;. The format of the show remained largely the same through its 12-year run; a contestant was asked a series of progressively more difficult questions which began at $1 and ended at a top prize of $64.

==Show creation==
&quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; was created by Louis G. Cowan, formerly known for radio&#x27;s &quot;Quiz Kids&quot; and the television series &quot;Stop the Music&quot; and &quot;Down You Go&quot;. Cowan drew the inspiration for the name from &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot;, and its $64 top prize offering. He decided to expand the figure to $64,000 for the new television program.

Finally, Cowan convinced Revlon. The key: Revlon founder and chieftain Charles Revson knew top competitor Hazel Bishop had fattened its sales through sponsoring the popular &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, and he wanted a piece of that action if he could have it. Revlon first signed a deal to sponsor Cowan&#x27;s brainchild for 13 weeks with the right to withdraw when they expired.

&quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; premiered June 7, 1955 on CBS-TV, sponsored by cosmetics maker Revlon and originating from the start live from CBS-TV Studio 52 in New York (later the disco-theater Studio 54).

To increase the show&#x27;s drama and suspense, and because radio host Phil Baker had bombed earlier in the decade with his lone television effort &quot;Who&#x27;s Whose&quot;, it was decided to use an actor rather than a broadcaster as the host. Television and film actor Hal March, familiar to TV viewers as a supporting regular on &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; and &quot;My Friend Irma&quot;, found instant fame as the quiz show&#x27;s host, and Lynn Dollar stood nearby as his assistant. Author and TV panelist Dr. Bergen Evans was the show&#x27;s expert authority, and actress Wendy Barrie did the &quot;Living Lipstick&quot; commercials. To capitalize on the initial television success, the show was also simulcast for two months on CBS Radio where it was heard from October 4, 1955, to November 29, 1955.

==Gameplay==
Contestants first chose a subject category (such as &quot;Boxing&quot;, &quot;Lincoln&quot;, &quot;Jazz&quot; or &quot;Football&quot;) from the Category Board. Although this board was a large part of the set, it was seen only briefly, evidently to conceal the fact that categories were sometimes hastily added to match a new contestant&#x27;s subject. The contestant was then asked questions only in the chosen category, earning money which doubled ($64, $128, $256, $512; then $1,000, $2,000, $4,000, $8,000, $16,000, $32,000, and finally $64,000) as the questions became more difficult. At the $4,000 level, a contestant returned each week for only one question per week. The contestant could quit at any time and retire with their money, but until they won $512, they lost all winnings for answering a question incorrectly. Missing a $1,000, $2,000, or $4,000 question left the contestant with $512. If a contestant missed a question after winning $4,000 they received a consolation prize of a new Cadillac. Starting with the $8,000 question, the contestant was placed in the Revlon &quot;isolation booth&quot;, where they could hear nothing but the host&#x27;s words. As long as the contestant kept answering correctly, they stayed on the show until they had won $64,000.

==Public reception==
Almost immediately, &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; beat every other program on Tuesday nights in ratings. Broadcast historian Robert Metz, in &quot;CBS: Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye&quot;, claimed U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower himself did not want to be disturbed while the show was on and that the nation&#x27;s crime rate, movie theater, and restaurant patronage dropped dramatically when the show aired. It earned the #1 rating spot for the 1955–56 season, holding the distinction of being the only television show to knock &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; out of the #1 spot, and finished at #4 in the 1956–57 season and #20 in 1957–58. Among its imitators or inspirations were &quot;The Big Surprise&quot;, &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot;, and &quot;Twenty-One&quot;.

===&quot;The $64,000 Challenge&quot;===
Not only did Charles Revson not exercise his withdrawal right, but he wanted another way to take advantage of &quot;Question&quot;&#x27;s swollen audience. April 8, 1956 saw the debut of &quot;The $64,000 Challenge&quot; (initially co-sponsored by Revlon and Lorillard Tobacco Company&#x27;s Kent cigarettes), hosted through August 26 by future children&#x27;s television star Sonny Fox and then, for the remainder of the show&#x27;s life, Ralph Story.

It pitted contestants against winners of at least $8,000 on &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; in a new, continuing game where they could win another $64,000. The contestants took turns answering questions from the same category starting at the $1,000 level. If they each answered a question correctly, they advanced to the $2,000 level. Starting at the $4,000 level, both contestants answered the same question while each standing in their own isolation booth. If, at any given level, a contestant answered correctly with the other contestant missing a question, the winning contestant either kept the money and faced a new player, or continued playing against the same opponent at the next money level.

In time, the sister show came to include various celebrities, including bandleader Xavier Cugat and child star Patty Duke, as well as former &quot;Question&quot; champions.

The J. Fred &amp; Leslie W. MacDonald Collection of the Library of Congress contains one kinescoped episode featuring Capt. Richard McCutchen as a contestant, broadcast July 1, 1956.

===Everyday celebrities===

&quot;Question&quot; contestants sometimes became celebrities themselves for a short while, including 11-year-old Robert Strom (who won $192,000) and Teddy Nadler ($252,000 across both shows), the two biggest winners in the show&#x27;s history. Other such newly made celebrities included Italian-born Bronx shoemaker Gino Prato, who won $32,000 for his encyclopedic knowledge of opera. The longest enduring of these newly made celebrities was psychologist Joyce Brothers. Answering questions about boxing, she became, after McCutchen, the second top winner, and went on to a career providing psychological advice in newspaper columns and TV shows for the next four decades. Another winner, Pennsylvania typist Catherine Kreitzer, read Shakespeare on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; kept a running tally of the money won on the show, which hit $1 million by the end of November 1956.

The &quot;American Experience&quot; (PBS) episode probing the scandal noted:
===Merchandising and parodies===
One category on the Revlon Category Board was &quot;Jazz&quot;, and within months of the premiere Columbia Records issued a 1955 album of various jazz artists under the tie-in title &quot;$64,000 Jazz&quot; (CL 777, also EP B-777), with the following tracks: &quot;The Shrike&quot; (Pete Rugolo), &quot;Perdido&quot; (J.J. Johnson, Kai Winding), &quot;Laura&quot; (Erroll Garner), &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot; (Benny Goodman), &quot;Tawny&quot; (Woody Herman), &quot;One O&#x27;Clock Jump&quot; (Harry James), &quot;How Hi the Fi&quot; (Buck Clayton), &quot;I&#x27;m Comin&#x27;, Virginia&quot; (Eddie Condon), &quot;A Fine Romance&quot; (Dave Brubeck, Paul Desmond), &quot;I Let A Song Go Out of My Heart&quot; (Duke Ellington), and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot; (Louis Armstrong).

Other musical tie-ins included the 1955 song &quot;The $64,000 Question (Do You Love Me)&quot;, recorded by Bobby Tuggle (Checker 823), Jackie Brooks (Decca 29684), and the Burton Sisters (RCA Victor 47-6265). &quot;Love Is the $64,000 Question&quot; (1956), which used the show&#x27;s theme music by Norman F. Leyden with added Fred Ebb lyrics, was recorded by Hal March (Columbia 40684), Karen Chandler (Decca 29881), Jim Lowe (Dot 15456), and Tony Travis (RCA Victor 47-6476).

When the show was revived in 1976 as The $128,000 Question, its theme music and cues were performed (albeit with a new disco-style arrangement for the theme) by Charles Randolph Grean, who released a three-and-a-half-minute single, &quot;The $128,000 Question&quot; (the show&#x27;s music and cues as an instrumental), with the B-side (&quot;Sentimentale&quot;) on the Ranwood label (45rpm release R-1064). For the show&#x27;s second season, Grean&#x27;s music package was re-recorded by Guido Basso.

There were numerous parodies of the program, including in the Foghorn Leghorn cartoon &quot;Fox-Terror&quot;, Bob and Ray&#x27;s &quot;The 64-Cent Question&quot;. &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; featured Hal March as a contestant in an October 20, 1957 spoof with Benny asking the questions. As a gag, Benny actually appeared as a contestant on &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; on October 8, 1957, but insisted on walking away with $64 after answering the first question. Hal March finally gave him $64 out of his own pocket.

At the height of its popularity, &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; was referenced in the scripts of other CBS shows, usually but not exclusively through punch lines that included references to &quot;the isolation booth&quot; or &quot;reaching the first plateau&quot;. Typical of these was spoken by &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;&#x27; Ed Norton (Art Carney), who identified three times in a man&#x27;s life when he wants to be alone, with the third being &quot;when he&#x27;s in the isolation booth of &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot;&quot;. At least three other &quot;Honeymooners&quot; episodes referenced &quot;Question&quot;: In &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Work Is Never Done&quot; Ralph proposes to Alice that he go on the show because he&#x27;s an expert in the &quot;Aggravation&quot; category. In &quot;Hello, Mom&quot; Norton tells Ralph that his mother-in-law&#x27;s category on the show would be &quot;Nasty&quot;. In &quot;The Worry Wart&quot;, Ralph advises Alice to become a contestant because she&#x27;s an expert in the &quot;Everything&quot; category.

Another episode of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, delivered one of the best known &quot;Question&quot; references – a parody of the show itself, in one of the so-called &quot;Original 39&quot; episodes of the timeless situation comedy. In that episode, blustery bus driver Ralph Kramden becomes a contestant on the fictitious &quot;$99,000 Answer&quot;. Regarded as one of the Golden Age of Television&#x27;s best quiz show parodies, the &quot;Honeymooners&quot; episode depicted Kramden spending a week intensively studying popular songs, only to blow the first question on the subject when he returned to play on the show. The host of the fictitious &quot;$99,000 Answer&quot; was one Herb Norris, played by former &quot;Twenty Questions&quot; emcee and future &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot; host Jay Jackson.

The show has been referenced on other game shows. On the U.S. version of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, an episode aired January 15, 2007, in which the banker&#x27;s offer was $64,000. Host Howie Mandel said, &quot;This is the $64,000 question&quot;.

In many money trees of most variations of the television series &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, the amount of $64,000 is often included as the prize money awarded for correctly answering the 11th question.

==Scandal and cancellation==

In mid-August 1958, while both &quot;Question&quot; and &quot;Challenge&quot; had already been announced as part of CBS&#x27;s fall lineup, the network&#x27;s quiz show &quot;Dotto&quot; was cancelled without explanation. A federal investigation was launched by the end of August on the allegation that a &quot;Dotto&quot; contestant had been given answers in advance. The probe soon included NBC&#x27;s &quot;Twenty-One&quot;, and was expected to expand further.

In the first week of September, a contestant of &quot;Challenge&quot;, Rev. Charles Jackson, came forward to say he had been given answers in advance. On September 13, Lorillard Tobacco Company pulled its sponsorship of the show; this made the previous airing on September 7 the last for &quot;Challenge&quot;. &quot;The $64,000 Challenge&quot; was replaced on CBS with &quot;a special news program&quot; on September 14.

&quot;The $64,000 Question&quot;, which had not yet begun airing for the new season, assumed &quot;Challenge&quot;&#x27;s Sunday time slot on September 21. After the federal probe of quiz shows surfaced, quiz shows suffered badly in the Fall 1958 Nielsen ratings. In late October, strong rumors had surfaced that &quot;Question&quot; was slated for movement to a less desirable time slot, or cancellation. Cancellation was made official after &quot;Question&quot;&#x27;s November 2 airing.

The game show ceased operations for good on November 21, 1958.

===Scandal===
&quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; was closely monitored by its sponsor&#x27;s CEO, Revlon&#x27;s Charles Revson, who often interfered with production, especially attempting to bump contestants he himself disliked, regardless of audience reaction. Revson&#x27;s brother, Martin, was assigned to oversee production, including heavy discussions of feedback the show received.

According to &quot;Question&quot; producer Joe Cates, an IBM sorting machine was used to present lower dollar value questions, to give the illusion that the questions were randomly selected – in fact, all of the cards were identical.

Nadler&#x27;s victory was called into question when he failed a civil service exam in 1960 applying a job for the United States Census Bureau. Producers eventually acknowledged he had been shown questions beforehand but not answers, noting that he already knew the answers beforehand; he was exonerated of wrongdoing.

The most prominent victim may have been the man who initially launched the franchise. Louis Cowan, made CBS Television president as a result of &quot;Question&quot;&#x27;s fast success, was forced out of the network as the quiz scandal ramped up, even though it was NBC&#x27;s quiz shows bearing most of the brunt of the scandal – and even though CBS itself, with a little help from sponsor Colgate-Palmolive, had moved fast in cancelling the popular &quot;Dotto&quot; at almost the moment it was confirmed that that show had been rigged. Cowan had never been suspected of taking part in any attempt to rig either &quot;Question&quot; or &quot;Challenge&quot;; later CBS historians suggested his reputation as an administrative bottleneck may have had as much to do with his firing as his tie to the tainted shows. Cowan may have been a textbook sacrificial lamb, in a bid to preempt any further scandal while the network scrambled to recover, and while president Frank Stanton accepted complete responsibility for any wrongdoing committed under his watch.

===Aftermath===
By the end of 1959, all first generation big-money quizzes were gone, with single-sponsorship television following and a federal law against fixing television game shows (an amendment to the 1960 Communications Act) coming. Over the course of the early 1960s, the networks wound down their five-figure jackpot game shows; &quot;Jackpot Bowling&quot; (1959–1961) and &quot;Make That Spare&quot; (1960–1964), which both escaped the fallout due to bowling being harder to fix, a period on &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; (1960) when its Bonus Stunt grew in $100 increments past the $10,000 mark until finally being won for $20,100 on September 23, &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; (ended 1961) and the more lavish prize offerings on &quot;The Nighttime Price Is Right&quot; (1957–1964) were the few remaining shows offering large prizes. Only one traditional big-money quiz show, the short-lived ABC quiz &quot;100 Grand&quot; (1963), was attempted in the subsequent years; the networks stayed away from awarding five-figure cash jackpots until the premiere of &quot;The $10,000 Pyramid&quot; and &quot;Match Game 73&quot; in 1973. The disappearance of the quiz shows gave rise to television&#x27;s next big phenomenon–Westerns.

The scandals also resulted in a shift of the balance of power between networks and sponsors. The networks used the scandals to justify taking control of their programs away from sponsors, thereby eliminating any potential future manipulation in prime-time broadcasting, and giving the networks full autonomy over program content.

None of the people directly involved in rigging any of the quiz shows faced any penalty more severe than suspended sentences for perjury before the federal grand jury that probed the scandal, even if many hosts and producers found themselves frozen out of television for many years. One &quot;Question&quot; contestant, Doll Goostree, sued both CBS and the producers in a bid to recoup $4,000 she said she might have won if her match of &quot;Question&quot; had not been rigged. Neither Goostree nor any other quiz contestant who similarly sued won their cases.

*Louis Cowan – In addition to &quot;Quiz Kids&quot; (1949–1951) and &quot;Stop the Music&quot; (1949–1952, 1954–1956), Cowan also created &quot;Down You Go&quot; (1951–1956) and the short-lived &quot;Ask Me Another&quot; (1952). Cowan briefly served as CBS Television Network president before leaving in the wake of the quiz show scandals. He later joined the faculty of the Columbia University school of journalism. He and his wife Polly were killed in an apartment fire in New York City in 1976. Lou Cowan&#x27;s son Geoffrey later produced brief revivals of &quot;Quiz Kids&quot; in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and is currently dean of the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication.
*Hal March – The former comic actor who became an overnight star on &quot;Question&quot; continued to appear as an actor in television and movies throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Shortly after he signed on as host of &quot;It&#x27;s Your Bet&quot; in 1969, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and died in 1970, four months short of his 50th birthday.
*Irwin &quot;Sonny&quot; Fox – The first &quot;Challenge&quot; host was also known at the time for co-hosting the CBS children&#x27;s travelogue &quot;Let&#x27;s Take a Trip&quot; (Fox described it as &quot;Taking two children on sort of an electronic field trip every week–live, remote location, no audience, no sponsors&quot;), but his fame rests predominantly on his eight-year (1959–1967) tour as the suave, congenial and dryly witty fourth host of New York&#x27;s Sunday morning children&#x27;s learn-and-laugh marathon, &quot;Wonderama&quot;. Fox hosted &quot;Way Out Games&quot; (1976–1977), a Saturday-morning series for CBS, then later spent a year (1977–1978) running children&#x27;s programming for NBC and eventually became a chairman of the board for Population Communications International, a nonprofit dedicated to &quot;technical assistance, research and training consultation to governments, NGOs and foundations on a wide range of social marketing and communications initiatives&quot;. Fox had also been a board chairman for the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. He died in 2021.
*Patty Duke – A child star (thanks to her Broadway portrayal of Helen Keller) when she appeared on &quot;Challenge&quot;, she eventually testified to Congressional investigators – and broke to tears when she admitted she had been coached to speak falsely, an incident Sonny Fox described when interviewed for the PBS program reviewing the quiz scandals. Duke survived to become a television star (&quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;) in the early-to-mid-1960s, before moving on to more film and television work (including a memorable role in &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;), becoming an activist in the Screen Actors Guild, writing two memoirs (&quot;Call Me Anna&quot; and &quot;A Brilliant Madness&quot;) describing her troubled child acting career and her lifelong battle with manic depression, and becoming an advocate for better protection and benefits for child actors. She died on March 29, 2016, from sepsis, resulting from a ruptured intestine.
*Charles Revson – Inspired by cosmetics competitor Hazel Bishop (whose sponsoring of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; provided big sales to Bishop) to think about television sponsorship in the first place, Revson was never investigated in his own right for his role in the quiz show scandals despite testifying (as did his brother, Martin) before Congress when the scandals broke in earnest. The cosmetics empire he founded, however, continued its success – and continued to sponsor television programming – for many years after the scandals faded away. Known as a hard-driving, hard-driven perfectionist whose overbearing manner usually alienated even his closest business partners, Revson&#x27;s success left him a billionaire when he died in 1975. His charitable foundation has since given over $145 million in grants to schools, hospitals, and service organizations in various Jewish communities.
*Dr. Joyce Brothers – Only the second contestant to win the show&#x27;s big prize (after expertly thwarting numerous attempts to bump her from the show because Martin Revson was said to have disliked her and doubted her credibility as a boxing expert), Brothers has enjoyed the most enduring fame and media success among anyone who rose to prominence by way of &quot;Question&quot;. Her championship as a boxing expert led to an invitation to become a commentator for CBS&#x27; telecast of a championship boxing match between Sugar Ray Robinson and Carmen Basilio. In August 1958, shortly after she earned her license to practice psychology in New York, Brothers was given her own television program, first locally in New York and then in national syndication. Making numerous television and radio appearances as a psychologist, not to mention numerous television comedy roles, Brothers has also written a long-running syndicated advice column in newspapers and magazines, which was used as a source for some questions on the 1998–2004 revival of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;. She is still considered, arguably, the first media psychologist. She died from respiratory failure on May 13, 2013, at age 85.
*Ralph Story – He became the much-loved host of &quot;Ralph Story&#x27;s Los Angeles&quot; (1964–1970), still considered the highest-rated, best-loved local show in Los Angeles television history. Story has also hosted &quot;A.M. Los Angeles&quot; and was the narrator for the ABC series &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; in 1972–1973. He died on September 26, 2006, at the age of 86.

==Revivals==
Selected PBS outlets showed surviving kinescopes of the original &quot;Question&quot; in Summer 1976, as a run-up to a new version of the show called &quot;The $128,000 Question&quot;, which ran for two years. The first season was hosted by Mike Darrow and produced at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City, while the second was produced at Global Television Network in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and hosted by Alex Trebek.

In 1999, television producer Michael Davies attempted to revive &quot;Question&quot; as &quot;The $640,000 Question&quot; for ABC, before abandoning that project in favor of producing an American version of the British game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;. &quot;Millionaire&quot; has a format very similar to &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; – 15 questions in which the contestant&#x27;s money roughly doubles with each correct question until reaching the top prize. However, the questions in &quot;Millionaire&quot; are of a broader variety than &quot;Question&quot;&#x27;s one-category line of questioning and have a different category for each question, all questions are multiple choice, contestants are allowed to leave the game with their money after a question is revealed but before it is answered, and &quot;Millionaire&quot; offers three chances for help (called &quot;lifelines&quot;), which were not present in &quot;Question&quot;.

In 2000, responding to the success of &quot;Millionaire&quot;, CBS bought the rights to the property in a reported effort to produce another revival attempt, called &quot;$64,000 Question&quot; (with a top prize of $1,024,000), to be hosted by sportscaster Greg Gumbel. Because of format issues similar to those encountered by Davies for ABC, a pilot was taped on April 19, 2000 but was never broadcast. Wink Martindale uploaded that full pilot as part of his ongoing &quot;Wink&#x27;s Vault&quot; series his &quot;YouTube&quot; page as a tribute to Gumbel shortly after his death in December 2024.on December 29, 2024.

==International versions==
===Australia===
A similar version of &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; was successful in Australia from 1960 to 1971 on Seven Network. Initially called &quot;Coles £3000 Question&quot;, the show changed its name to &quot;Coles $6000 Question&quot; on February 14, 1966 (the date Australia converted to decimal currency) and was sponsored for most of its run by Coles Stores. In July 1971, Coles dropped its sponsorship and the show became &quot;The $7000 Question&quot;. It was hosted by Malcolm Searle (1960–1963) and Roland Strong (1963–1971).

===Denmark===
A Danish version of the show called was made in Denmark. The show originally aired from 1957 to 1959, with a top prize of 10,000 Danish kroner. It was revived in 1984, then again in 1990 and again in 1999. The latest revival in 2013 was aimed at kids and also included kids as participants.

===Italy===
The Italian version of this quiz was (1955–1959). The prize money doubled from 2,560,000 lire to 5,120,000 lire.

===Mexico===
The Mexican version, , lasted from 1956 to 1994 with some interruptions, changes of name to compensate peso devaluation, and changes of TV network. Most of the time it was hosted by Pedro Ferriz. A movie was made in which Ferriz asks questions to a character played by Sara García, known then as &quot;Mexican Cinema&#x27;s Granny&quot;.

===Poland===
The Polish version of this quiz was (&quot;The Great Game&quot;, 1962–2006). Initially the rules and the studio set-up matched the original&#x27;s, but in 1975 both were changed by Wojciech Pijanowski, creator, producer, writer, and/or host of many quiz shows in Poland in the late 20th century, as the isolation booth was abandoned and a large turntable was added in the center of the studio floor, displaying the prize amount for each round, upon which the envelopes containing the questions were placed. The categories became more specific (e.g., Mozart—life and compositions, Muslim conquests in the 7th–8th centuries), were limited to art, history (most categories), geography, and zoology, and were now chosen by players during the elimination rounds.

After 1975, the game had the following rounds: 
*The first round was a duel between two players; it consisted of up to 20 questions and lasted until one player had gotten two questions wrong. Players wore headphones playing loud music in order not to hear during each other&#x27;s turns.
*The second round was an &quot;exam&quot;, in which the player who had won the duel now had to answer three questions from each of three experts in a category. The player could make up to two mistakes. If successful, the player then received a prize.
*In the third, fourth, and final rounds, the player drew envelopes with questions from the big turntable, with the prize doubling each round. The grand prize changed over the years: primarily it was 25,000 złoty (about equal to the average annual wage); later it was 40,000 zlotys (c. $12,000). The hosts were Ryszard Serafinowicz (1962–1969), Joanna Rostocka (1969–1973, previously Serafinowicz&#x27;s co-host), Janusz Budzyński (1973–1975) and Stanisława Ryster (1975–2006).

Although the show was cancelled due to low viewership, the cancellation was controversial because of how highly regarded it was by many people, especially those who were still watching it, and because some games that were planned or already in progress were not completed.

There were plans to revive the show in 2016 as (&quot;The Greater Game&quot;) in an altered format, but eventually those plans were cancelled.

===Sweden===
The Swedish version of this quiz was (1957–1994).

===United Kingdom===
There were three derived versions in the UK: earlier, &quot;The 64,000 Question&quot;, &quot;The 64,000 Challenge&quot; (both with no dollar sign), and later, &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The phrase &quot;the $64,000 question&quot; is an idiom and is routinely used as a way of saying &quot;the most important question&quot;. It is derived from the fact that the ultimate question on the show was indeed, the $64,000 question.

<text>Alvin Goldstein (January 10, 1936December 19, 2013) was an American pornographer best known for helping normalize hardcore pornography in the United States.

==Background==
Goldstein was born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn to a Jewish family. He attended Boys High. He captained the debate team at Pace College and interviewed Allen Ginsberg for the college newspaper. He served in the Army in the Signal Corps as a photographer , He worked as a photojournalist, taking pictures of Jacqueline Kennedy on a 1962 state trip to Pakistan and spent several days in a Cuban jail for taking unauthorized photos of Fidel Castro&#x27;s brother, Raúl. He also sold insurance, wrote freelance articles, ran a dime pitch game at the 1964-65 New York World&#x27;s Fair, sold encyclopedias, rugs and his own blood, drove a taxi (he kept his taxi license active until his death), and landed a job as an industrial spy infiltrating a labor union, an experience that so appalled him he wrote an exposé about it for the radical newspaper &quot;New York Free Press&quot;, a weekly periodical.

==Print publications==
===&quot;Screw&quot;===
In November 1968, Goldstein and his partner Jim Buckley, investing $175 each (equivalent to $ today), founded &quot;Screw&quot;, a weekly New York City tabloid. It featured reviews of porn movies, peep shows, erotic massage parlors, brothels, escorts and other local offerings of the adult entertainment industry. Such items were interspersed with news concerning sexual topics, critical reviews of sexual books, and hardcore &quot;gynecological&quot; pictorials. Goldstein regularly ran, without permission, photos and drawings of celebrities.

&quot;&quot;Screw&quot; grew from a combination of many factors, chief of which was my own dissatisfaction with the sex literature of 1968 and my yearning for a publication that reflected my sexual appetites,&quot; Goldstein wrote. &quot;I may be making a lot of money, but I really believe I&#x27;m doing some good by demythologizing a lot about sexuality&quot;, he said in a Playboy Interview. It was described as &quot;raunchy, obnoxious, usually disgusting and sometimes political.&quot; The initial price was 25¢. At its peak, &quot;Screw&quot; sold 140,000 copies weekly.

Arrested 19 times on obscenity charges, he spent millions of dollars on First Amendment lawsuits, ultimately scoring a major victory when a federal judge dismissed an obscenity case in 1974. (Goldstein believed that the case began as a result of &quot;Screw&quot; article, &quot;Is J. Edgar Hoover a Fag?&quot;, the first published comment on Hoover&#x27;s sexuality.) Venue-shopping prosecutors selected conservative Wichita, Kansas, to prosecute Goldstein for obscenity; when he was found not guilty, he flew the jury to New York to attend a party at the swing club Plato&#x27;s Retreat. His long-term attorney was Herald Price Fahringer.

According to Will Sloan, &quot;Goldstein was the first journalist to seriously review porn films. Had he not written a rave review of a low-budget film called &quot;Deep Throat&quot; (&#x27;I was never so moved by any theatrical performance since stuttering through my own bar mitzvah&#x27;), it would never have become a hit at New York&#x27;s World Theater, would never have been targeted by the vice squad, would never have spawned a First Amendment cause célèbre, and might not have led to the modern porn industry.&quot;

===&quot;Bitch&quot; magazine===
In the March 11, 1974 issue of &quot;Screw&quot;, Goldstein ran an ad seeking subscribers to a new magazine, &quot;Bitch&quot;, which &quot;brings women&#x27;s sexuality out of the closet for the first time&quot; and also &quot;takes women out of politics and puts them back on their back where they belong.&quot; (Note: there have been several other magazines also called &quot;Bitch&quot;.) The first issue &quot;contain[ed] an explosive symposium about blowjobs by four women who talk about giving head and what they like and don&#x27;t like about it&quot;. Also included in the premiere issue was an interview with actor James Caan, and a centerfold of a man shot by a female photographer.

===&quot;Smut&quot; Magazine===
In the same March 11, 1974 issue of &quot;Screw&quot;, Goldstein also ran an ad seeking subscribers to &quot;Smut&quot;, a magazine &quot;so filthy that not only do you have to wash after every page, but every reader must disinfect after reading! SMUT is so dirty, so scummy, that once you have it on your hands you can&#x27;t get it off!&quot; The magazine offered pornography in images and words, without the news articles found in &quot;Screw&quot;.

===&quot;National Screw&quot;===
In 1976-1977 &quot;National Screw&quot; was published; the place of publication was given as Secaucus, New Jersey. The June 1977 issue of the magazine contained, according to its cover, a new story by William Burroughs and an interview with Allen Ginsberg. It is known to have published at least nine issues (76–77), also containing original adult comic strip work from comic artist legends Wally Wood and Will Eisner.

===&quot;Death&quot; magazine===
In 1979, Goldstein began &quot;Death&quot; magazine. It lasted four issues. The February, 1980 issue had a picture of Elvis Presley on the cover, &quot;Grim Reaper Awards&quot;, &quot;Eulogy to a War Lover&quot;, &quot;Death by Hanging&quot;, &quot;Femme Fatales&quot;, and other articles.

===&quot;Screw West&quot;===
In 1979-1980 Goldstein&#x27;s company, Milky Way Productions, published &quot;Screw West&quot; out of an office in Hollywood, California. According to an advertisement, it was intended to answer such questions as, &quot;Where can I get laid in San Francisco? What&#x27;s the best swinger&#x27;s club in Los Angeles? How do I find all those out-of-the-way Pacific Coast nude beaches? And what are those bawdy brothels outside Las Vegas really like?&quot; It is known to have published 54 issues.

==Movies and television==
===&quot;It Happened in Hollywood&quot;===
In 1973, &quot;Screw Magazine present[ed]&quot; &quot;It Happened in Hollywood&quot;, a pornographic movie, produced by Goldstein&#x27;s partner Jim Buckley. Goldstein played a character in the movie, and is also credited as &quot;fourth unit director.&quot; At the 2nd Annual New York Erotic Film Festival it won awards for Best Picture, Best Female Performance, and Best Supporting Actor.

===&quot;Midnight Blue&quot;===
In 1974 Goldstein began &quot;Screw Magazine of the Air&quot;, soon renamed &quot;Midnight Blue&quot;, a thrice weekly hour-long adult-oriented public access television program that ran for nearly 30 years on Manhattan Cable Television&#x27;s Channel J; federal regulations regarding public access to cable TV systems made it impossible for the cable system to refuse his program. (Similarly, Goldstein used a legal prohibition on the censorship of political advertisements to force television broadcast of pornography, under a transparent, but legal, veil of &quot;political candidacy&quot;.) In it, he regularly interviewed porn stars, other adult industry figures, and sympathetic celebrities and &quot;freaks&quot;, and ran advertisements for brothels, phone sex services, and Sammy&#x27;s Roumanian Steakhouse.

In the later years, after departure of original director Alex Bennett, Goldstein featured on each program a &quot;Fuck You&quot; segment, a few minutes in which he viciously attacked celebrities, politicians, the judge who presided over his latest trial, the New York County District Attorney, and businesses he felt had wronged him.

&quot;In its early years, &quot;Midnight Blue&quot; captured porn star Georgina Spelvin doing her nude tap-dance act at the Melody Burlesque; Tara Alexander attempting the world&#x27;s biggest gang bang at Plato&#x27;s Retreat, the New York swing club; the 10th anniversary &quot;Screw&quot; party, where Buck Henry and Melvin Van Peebles hobnob with Goldstein&#x27;s jurors; and an early look at the S&amp;M community in New York. Throughout its run, Midnight Blue interviewed almost every major porn star, and regularly tested the limits of what was acceptable for cable television.&quot; Seven volumes of excerpts from the show have been issued on DVD.

===SOS: Screw on the Screen===
In 1975, Goldstein issued &quot;SOS: Screw on the Screen&quot;, a stridently unsexy attempt at a cinematic newsmagazine that included a lot of goofy comedy, a gay scene, and several minutes of Goldstein ranting about America&#x27;s sexual hypocrisy. Also appearing was Honeysuckle Divine (who often appeared in &quot;SCREW&quot;). A poster of her was on sale in the same issue. Honeysuckle Divine was a Times Square stripper whose specialty was inserting objects such as pickles in her vagina, shooting out many of them. She put the pickles in baggies and sold them to patrons. Goldstein said that her act &quot;was unbelievably disgusting, so naturally, we made her our symbol.&quot;

==Other business ventures==
===The Screw Store===
In the May 17, 1976, issue of &quot;Screw&quot; Goldstein ran an ad for the &quot;Screw Store&quot;, which offered dildos, including a &quot;Bicentennial Dildo&quot;, vibrating Ben wa eggs, and a vibrating cock ring. Selling dildos brought one of Goldstein&#x27;s many arrests.

===Al Goldstein&#x27;s Cinema===
The October 17, 1977, issue of &quot;Screw&quot; contained an advertisement for &quot;Al Goldstein&#x27;s Cinema&quot;, located at 8th Avenue and 46th Street near Times Square. Admission was 99¢. In the same issue, in the movie listings, it is described as &quot;a large, comfortable porn house which shows average hardcore features. Some of these are first-run features, some have already played theaters in the city.&quot; The theater is not found in a listing of porn theaters from 1979.

===Rabbit Ranch===
In 2001, on Saint Martin, an island in the Lesser Antilles, Goldstein planned to open the Rabbit Ranch, the first of what he hoped would be a chain of 10 to 30 bordellos that would flourish wherever prostitution is legal. He intended to use the profits to finance his second run for sheriff. The brothel never opened; authorities refused to give him a license because he was not a citizen of that nation. &quot;We didn&#x27;t bribe the right people or something,&quot; he said.

== Political and religious views ==

===Views on the Iranian regime===
In April 1989, Goldstein ran a full-page ad in &quot;Screw&quot; offering $1 million for the assassination of the Ayatollah Khomeini, in response to Khomeini&#x27;s February 1989 fatwa against novelist Salman Rushdie for allegedly blaspheming Islam. (Khomeini died of natural causes in June 1989.)

===Views on religion===
In his 2004 book &quot;XXX-Communicated: A Rebel Without a Shul&quot;, Luke Ford wrote about a conversation with Goldstein, in which Ford asked Goldstein why Jews were dramatically overrepresented in the porn industry. He answered, &quot;The only reason that Jews are in pornography is that we think that Christ sucks. Catholicism sucks. We don&#x27;t believe in authoritarianism. Pornography thus becomes a way of defiling Christian culture and, as it penetrates to the very heart of the American mainstream (and is no doubt consumed by those very same WASPs), its subversive character becomes more charged.&quot; Ford then asked, &quot;What does it mean to you to be a Jew?&quot; To which Goldstein responded, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t mean anything. It means that I&#x27;m called a kike.&quot; Ford also asked, &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot; Goldstein said, &quot;I believe in me. I&#x27;m God. Screw God. God is your need to believe in some super being. I am the super being. I am your God, admit it. We&#x27;re random. We&#x27;re the flea on the butt of the dog.&quot;

==Personal life==

===Friendship with Larry Flynt===
One of Goldstein&#x27;s best friends was Larry Flynt. Goldstein said that Flynt&#x27;s &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine, founded seven years after &quot;Screw&quot;, stole the &quot;Hustler&quot; format from &quot;Screw&quot;, but that he was not angry. According to Goldstein, Flynt succeeded in creating a national publication, at which he had failed.

===Family===
Goldstein married five times and had a son, Jordan Ari Goldstein, with his third wife, Gina. According to Goldstein, he and Jordan had a close relationship until the Goldsteins&#x27; divorce. They became estranged after Al called Gina &quot;a contemptible vagina&quot;.

==Life in Florida==
While mostly associated with the city of New York, Goldstein was also a well-known figure in Broward County, Florida, making the cover of a local alternative tabloid, &quot;New Times&quot;. He owned a 10,000-square-foot mansion in Pompano Beach, famous for its statue, high, of a raised middle finger on the back lawn, visible to boaters on the Intracoastal Waterway.

In 1992, he filed to run for sheriff against Nick Navarro, who had gained Goldstein&#x27;s enmity by arresting on obscenity charges 2 Live Crew members and a record dealer who sold their album &quot;As Nasty As They Wanna Be&quot;. (The accused were convicted, but won on appeal.) Goldstein withdrew before the election took place. In 2001 he spoke publicly of his intent to run a second time, against Ken Jenne, on a platform of &quot;leaving folks the hell alone&quot;. He never filed, saying that he could not afford the campaign.

==Final years==

===Legal issues and financial woes===
In 2002, Goldstein was found guilty of harassing a former employee, having published her telephone number and place of employment in &quot;Screw&quot; and encouraging readers to call her and tell her &quot;to stop being such a cunt.&quot; Goldstein was sentenced to 60 days in jail. He served six days before the charges were overturned on appeal. Goldstein apologized as part of a plea bargain. Unable to make payroll, &quot;Screw&quot; folded in 2003; only 600 copies were sold of the final issue.
Goldstein&#x27;s company, Milky Way Productions, which published &quot;Screw&quot; and &quot;Midnight Blue&quot;, entered bankruptcy in 2004, having lost sales and subscribers as a result of the proliferation of internet pornography, abetted by Goldstein&#x27;s financial mismanagement.

Goldstein lost his Florida mansion and his townhouse on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side. Jobless and penniless, he ended up living briefly in a Manhattan homeless shelter. He was fired from New York&#x27;s well-known Second Avenue Deli for sleeping in the basement, after a brief stint there as a greeter.

Goldstein was arrested for shoplifting four health-related books from Barnes &amp; Noble. He worked in 2005 as a commissioned salesman for New York City Bagels. Between 2005 and 2008, he blogged for booble.com, a pornographic search engine (defunct as of 2023); he then continued on his own website until 2009.

Goldstein was financially supported in his last years by his friend the illusionist Penn Jillette, on whose floor he once slept, and who admired Goldstein for his First Amendment activism. His final residence, prior to a nursing home, was a small apartment in the Far Rockaway neighborhood of Queens, paid for by Jillette.

===Death===
Goldstein died on December 19, 2013, aged 77, from renal failure at a nursing home in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.

==Legacy==
=== Obituary ===
Goldstein was described in his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a cartoonishly vituperative amalgam of Borscht Belt comic, free-range social critic and sex-obsessed loser who seemed to embody a moment in New York City&#x27;s cultural history: the sleaze and decay of Times Square in the 1960s and ‘70s.&quot;

===Documentary===
In 2003, Lancaster Pictures produced a documentary on Goldstein entitled &quot;Goldstein: The Trials of the Sultan of Smut&quot;. It focused on his legal troubles. Larry Flynt, Ron Jeremy, and Jimmy Breslin appeared in the movie. He claimed to have had 7,000 sexual partners. Another writer called him &quot;a hairy, sweaty, cigar-chomping, eczema-ridden fatso&quot;.

===Retrospective===
In his 2011 book &quot;Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! – of Playboys, Pigs, and Penthouse Paupers, an American Tale of Sex and Wonder&quot;, former &quot;Screw&quot; writer and editor Mike Edison documents Goldstein&#x27;s rise and fall against the successes of his peers Larry Flynt of &quot;Hustler&quot;, Bob Guccione of &quot;Penthouse&quot;, and Hugh Hefner of &quot;Playboy&quot;. Edison also lauds Goldstein as a staunch fighter for the First Amendment, quoting Gay Talese, who referred to Goldstein in his book &quot;Thy Neighbor&#x27;s Wife&quot;, saying, &quot;We need a free society, and freedom is not won by literary tea parties and well-meaning, virtuous publishers, it is won by disreputable people like Al Goldstein.&quot; Edison also quotes the New York reporter Jimmy Breslin as saying, &quot;Al Goldstein is one of four people in the last 35 years who has effectively protected the First Amendment rights of reporters who bring the news to you. The others are Ralph Ginzburg, Larry Flynt, and Lenny Bruce. I know you don’t want to meet them, but you owe them.”

<doc id="337428" wikidata="Q1779527" url="?curid=337428" title="Studentenverbindung">
<text> or studentische Korporation (; often referred to as Verbindung) is the umbrella term for many different kinds of fraternity-type associations in German-speaking countries, including Corps, , , , and Catholic fraternities. Worldwide, there are over 1,600 , about a thousand in Germany, with a total of over 190,000 members. In them, students spend their university years in an organized community, whose members stay connected even after graduation. A goal of this lifelong bond () is to create contacts and friendships over many generations and to facilitate networking. The is very important for the longevity of these networks.

Their autonomous and grassroots democratic is also an important similarity of all student corporations. Apart from the and the , every Studentenverbindung also has a so-called (borrowed French for &#x27;how&#x27;). The is a body of rules that organize various different aspects of fraternity life such as the , academic fencing (), and general rules of conduct.

Fraternities of this particular type are present in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Hungary, Latvia, Estonia, (formerly) German or German-speaking areas and other smaller communities in Europe, and Chile. Less than 1% of all current students and living alumni in Germany are active members of a .

== Organization ==

Studentenverbindungen consist of active members who are students currently enrolled at a university, and the graduated &quot;Alte Herren,&quot; &quot;Altherren&quot; or &quot;Philister&quot; (Elder Gentlemen or alumni) / &quot;Hohe Damen&quot; (High Ladies) that were once active in these corporations and now provide guidance and the necessary financial backing.

The active students are commonly divided into four groups: the new, first year , the loose associate , the &quot;Burschen&quot; (German for &quot;fellow&quot;, full members), and the inactive &quot;Burschen&quot; (having been members for a set time limit, usually three or four semesters) forming the fraternity&#x27;s active core.

The fourth group, the &quot;Chargen&quot; are &quot;Burschen&quot; elected by the former groups&#x27; democratic vote and entitled to decide over certain situations of everyday fraternity life. Common &quot;Chargierte&quot; are the &quot;Senior&quot; (signing his name with an &quot;x&quot; at the end e.g. &quot;Mustermann Z! x&quot;), &quot;Consenior&quot; (xx) and the &quot;Drittchargierter&quot;, or often also called &quot;Scriptor&quot; (xxx). The &quot;Senior&#x27;s&quot; task is mainly to represent the fraternity to the outside and to lead it. The &quot;Consenior&quot; assists the &quot;Senior&quot; but mainly focuses on imparting the fencing practice, the organization of fraternity events and the constant contact to fellow female students. Whilst the &quot;Drittchargierter&quot; is in charge of mail correspondence, finance and diplomacy. Another &quot;Function&quot; often referred to as a Charge (Chargierter) is the so-called &quot;Fuchsmajor&quot; (FM). He is in charge of the and teaches them everything they need to know in fraternity life, except for fencing.

Studentenverbindungen, specially older ones, often possess large mansions, the , in which active members live. It usually consists of a dormitory and common rooms for festivities, most notably the (pub), celebrations on a regular basis involving student songs and other traditions.

One of the many benefits of joining a fraternity in Germany is the especially low pricing of the often high-quality rooms. Because &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot; are much less prevalent in campus life in comparison to US fraternities, some actively try to recruit new members through these low-priced rooms. After a certain period, the &quot;Fuchsenzeit&quot;, these new members have the opportunity to learn the traditions. After successful completion of all necessary tests and examinations they are usually accepted as full members.

Once finished with higher education and having started a career, the inactive &quot;Burschen&quot; are asked to resign from the fraternity&#x27;s core members and become &quot;Alte Herren&quot; or &quot;Philister&quot;. This involves losing influence in active fraternity life and in voting in the core fraternity&#x27;s democratic process, allowing younger generations to take their place. Major decisions, though, are still made by an annual Convent where every member, student or not, has at least one vote; the &quot;Alte Herren Commission&quot; (short &quot;AHC&quot;) which represent all &quot;Alte Herren&quot; usually have double votes and veto rights. They also take care of the financial overview and supervising the &quot;Verbindungshaus&quot;.

Furthermore, all &quot;Alte Herren&quot; are commonly asked to pay a certain annual sum to help sustain the fraternity fiscally, to actively participate in democratic decisions concerning only &quot;Alte Herren&quot;, and to pay regular visits to the fraternity&#x27;s festivities.

A notable characteristic of this structure is that the relationship between active members and &quot;Alte Herren&quot; is usually so close that even the youngest members are asked to address even their most decorated &quot;Alte Herren&quot; by &quot;Du&quot;, the intimate form of addressing someone in German, or even by their first names. This commonly includes referring to one another as &quot;Verbindungsbruder&quot; (&quot;Brother&quot;). As it is possible for any &quot;Verbindung&quot; to forge treaties with another, this may also be extended to members of other fraternities. This relationship between the old and the young allows young members to learn how to bear responsibilities themselves.

== Mensur ==
To laymen, the most well-known tradition of &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot; is the &quot;Mensur&quot;, a special form of very strictly regulated, fixed-stance fencing ritual. The &quot;Mensur&quot; is practised with sharp blades, and although the body is well-protected, it allows for deep (cosmetic) facial and cranial wounds, which often result in a scar which is called Schmiss. The &quot;Schmiss&quot; was once regarded as the passport to a better future, because the &quot;Mensur&quot; strives to educate physical and mental strength by exposing the combatants to a rare and extreme situation. In modern times, opinions differ, although the principle stays the same: whereas one would formerly engage in a &quot;Mensur&quot; to be hit, many fencing students of today will rather engage in combat in order to prove their competence by not being wounded, instead focusing on reinforcing the bond between members of the fraternity. Some fraternities that do not practice academic fencing have other rituals that are meant to substitute this ritual of group dynamics, such as extreme hiking.

While the &quot;Mensur&quot; is the most central principle to some &quot;Verbindungen&quot;, especially of the &quot;Corps&quot;, &quot;Burschenschaften&quot; and Landsmannschaften, these organizations require their members to fence as their representative. Other &quot;Verbindungen&quot; allow their members to fence voluntarily, but the majority of these now forbid their members to fence. In particular, Christian fraternities decline the &quot;Mensur&quot; from general ethical perspectives, with Catholic fraternities even being formally restricted on the ground of the 5th commandment &quot;You shall not kill&quot;, which includes the integrity of the God-given body in general.

== Hallmarks ==
=== Couleur ===
Visually, the most discerning characteristic of many Studentenverbindungen is the so-called &quot;Couleur&quot;, which can consist of anything from a small piece of ribbon worn over the belt, to elaborate uniforms with riding boots, sabers, and colorful cavalry jackets, depending on circumstances and tradition. Most commonly, a thin sash displaying (usually) three distinctive colors is worn in everyday life; this is called &quot;Band&quot;. Although this display was common in the past (Wilhelmine Period) it is not as common at German universities any more.

Color-wearing (&quot;farbentragend&quot;) Studentenverbindungen are those whose members wear a &quot;Band&quot; and headwear with their fraternity&#x27;s colors.
Many Burschenschaften wear the color combination Black-Red-Gold as a historical symbol for German unity. These colors were first worn by the Urburschenschaft in 1815.
There are also color-carrying or -bearing (&quot;farbenführend&quot;) Verbindungen: while their members do not wear a sash their colors are often represented in their uniforms and other Couleur, like flags.

Another visual hallmark is the , a monogram containing the fraternity&#x27;s initials and the letters &quot;v&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;f&quot; for the Latin words (&#x27;live, grow, flourish&#x27;) or (&#x27;long live the circle of brothers&#x27;). In fraternity documents, members sign their names with a after their signature.
 have their origin in abbreviations, by student orders of the 18th century, to show their affiliation in written documents. Today, are often used on clothing or other personal items. Sometimes, the fraternity&#x27;s coat of arms is also incorporated into objects, such as headgear or the (fencing rapier).

Many fraternity members can be identified through their , or by less obvious codes such as a certain style of dressing, e.g. Timberland boots and polo shirts. Furthermore, rare figures of speech can give the hint that a person is a member of a .

=== Coat of arms ===
Studentenverbindungen&#x27;s coats of arms do not strictly follow heraldic rules, their use started around the year 1800.
The escutcheon is often divided in four, Burschenschaften&#x27;s most commonly by a cross. These fields are filled with various non heraldic symbols, for example with the fraternity&#x27;s colors, the Zirkel, allusions to their university or city and other regional heraldic elements, also symbols for friendship and eternity, that are taken from Freemasons and antiquity.

=== Kneipe ===

More elaborate uniforms are usually worn at a &quot;Kneipe&quot; or, more formally, &quot;Commers&quot;, a kind of gathering only still preserved at &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot;. Such events can happen regularly but specially during holidays, for example to celebrate Christmas, to commemorate a deceased Verbindungs-brother (&quot;Trauerkneipe&quot;), or in remembrance of historic events or important dates in the fraternity&#x27;s history e.g. the founding day of the fraternity (&quot;Stiftungstagskneipe&quot;). During these gatherings, the crowd of members and guests present are presided over by the &quot;Chargierte&quot; (see above), with the &quot;Senior&quot; conducting the gathering, executing certain rituals, from as simple as welcoming guests, holding speeches to performing the so-called &quot;Landesvater&quot; (&quot;father of the country&quot;). The latter is a ceremonial where a sabre is pierced through the &quot;Couleur&quot;-bearing headgear of the participants in a complex ritual, accompanied by a ceremonial chant. While such rituals are only performed on the most solemn of occasions and thus very rare, a &quot;Kneipe&quot; commonly involves the lighter sides of life, such as rampant beer consumption and uninhibited singing of traditional student songs, of which some can be bawdy for the standards of time. Thus, this allows to get to know otherwise daunting members on a personal level due to the relaxed atmosphere at these gatherings.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
When the first universities formed in Paris, Bologna, and Salerno around the 12th century, Europe was divided into a large number of small states, which reflected itself in the composition of the student body. To ensure an equal influence on the university&#x27;s decisions, the students and teachers began to form &quot;nationes&quot;, with one &quot;nation&quot; for each native state of its members. This basic tradition was continued for a long time and still survives in Sweden and Finland to the present day.

When the first universities of the Holy Roman Empire were founded in Prague (1348), Vienna, and Heidelberg in the 14th century, they established a similar system, the &quot;&quot; (From Latin &quot;bursa&quot; meaning &quot;coin purse&quot;, from which &quot;Bursche&quot; stems, for the Burse&#x27;s collective funds). Students were forced to live in a dorm assigned by their native state and soon started taking up formal signs, often colorful clothing, to display their membership in a &quot;Burse&quot;. This continues in the colored sashes worn by modern &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot;. When the first duels were fought is not known exactly, because students were allowed to carry épées or sabers to be able to protect themselves and to deal with confrontations between rival groups (&quot;Raufduell&quot;).

In the 17th century, the respective sovereigns gained increasing control over &quot;their&quot; &quot;Burse&quot;, and the first fraternities were formally formed, calling themselves &quot;Landsmannschaften&quot;, giving themselves Latin names according to their country of origin (&quot;Borussia&quot; for Prussia, &quot;Guestphalia&quot; for Westphalia, etc.) and introducing &quot;Fuchs&quot; and &quot;Bursche&quot; as status designations. Lifelong membership, though, was not known. During this period, the regulated duel was developed, accompanied by the idea to defend one&#x27;s honor with a weapon and a strict code to guide the confrontation. This potentially lethal tradition continued until 1933 in Germany, with being so strict at some points, that e.g. a Prussian officer could be expelled if he was not willing to demand or give satisfaction.

As the &quot;Landsmannschaften&quot; faded during the early 1700s, secret organizations known as &quot;Studentenorden&quot; (student orders) took their place and introduced elaborate rituals, formal oaths of membership, a strict &quot;constitutio&quot; to regulate internal behavior, and cryptic symbols to identify members. All of these traditions are still known and actively practised in today&#x27;s fraternities. The &quot;Studentenorden&quot;, though, were heavily monitored by the then-absolutist government, as many of their traditions were derived from freemason or Illuminati lodges, and were subsequently banned in 1793.

=== Early 19th century ===
As &quot;Studentenorden&quot; were dissolved and their former members sought a possibility to continue their traditions, they began rebuilding a similar form of community under the then-common and insuspicious French word &quot;Corps&quot;. Symbols, oaths, regulations and rituals were continued from &quot;Studentenorden&quot; tradition (although the secrecy was omitted for longevity&#x27;s sake), and the Latin names, status designations and affiliation with a country of origin were copied from the now-extinct &quot;Landsmannschaften&quot;.

A new characteristic was the heavy influence of German idealism, in particular the works of Kant and Fichte. This resulted in a strong focus on forming young members to be strong, upright and honorable, in order for the nation&#x27;s &quot;best and brightest&quot; to spread these ideas throughout society. Political, especially geopolitical activities of &quot;Corps&quot; as a whole were actively discouraged, as social commitment was seen as more promising and less controversial. Another characteristic was to unify all of a city&#x27;s, and ultimately Germany&#x27;s, &quot;Corps&quot; under an umbrella organization and to vote on common rules and principles for each &quot;Corps&quot; to abide by. Hence the KSCV was created in 1848. The oldest, still existing &quot;Studentenverbindung&quot;, Corps Guestphalia Halle established in 1789, was a founding member.

=== &quot;Burschenschaft&quot; and rebellion against aristocracy ===

The &quot;Corps&quot; soon saw themselves heavily confronted by the &quot;Burschenschaft&quot;, which was first founded in 1815. Sparked by the nationalist sentiment after the Napoleonic Wars, the members of the latter perceived the traditional forms of fraternities, who were still heavily affiliated with their state of origin, to be reactionary and elitist. Thus, they organized themselves into what was pictured as a single fraternity spanning all states of German language, allowing the students to coordinate a nationalist revolution; i.e. a revolution to unify Germany and to abolish all princedoms. From the beginning, they were a dedicated political organization, in contrast to the &quot;Corps&quot;.

This early attempt failed in 1819 when the &quot;Burschenschaft&quot; was fragmented, but the sentiment prevailed. At this occasion, the modern German colors are mentioned for the first time in popular culture, in the seventh verse of August Daniel von Binzer&#x27;s song &quot;Wir hatten gebauet ein stattliches Haus&quot;, citing the colors of the Burschenschaft:
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Das Band ist zerschnitten,
war schwarz, rot und gold,
und Gott hat es gelitten,
wer weiß was er gewollt!&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;The ribbon is cut,
t&#x27;was black, red and gold,
and God suffer&#x27;d it,
who knows what his intent!&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Karlsbad Decrees ===
In the same year, due to general antisemitism prevalent in any social class, massive antisemitic protests, mainly fueled by students, craftsmen and traders, (see Hep-Hep riots) swept the German-speaking states, injuring and killing many. As a result, by the Karlsbad Decrees, any self-regulating student body was forcibly dissolved, severe censorship and punishments were instituted, and government authority was significantly increased.

This resulted in secret gatherings and smaller revolutionary acts, many of which are seen as the foundation for a German nation in today&#x27;s world, such as the Hambach festival in 1832, where the German colors flew as a flag for the first time, and the Frankfurter Wachensturm in 1833, a failed attempt to take a large city&#x27;s treasury to fund a revolution.

=== Revolution of 1848 and subsequent diversification ===

Tensions started to build, with short lived, illegal fraternities forming, being dissolved and reforming at all universities, peaking in the German revolution of 1848 in which many members of &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot; took part. Although the unification of Germany, according to the principles of the &quot;Burschenschaft&quot; soon failed violently, the &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot; had emancipated themselves, and many of the members of the first Frankfurt parliament were in fact &quot;Corps&quot; students or &quot;Burschenschaft&quot; members.

Thus, the general concept flourished quickly, and soon, the &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot; were no longer seen as clubs of young rowdies and revolutionaries, but as a valuable school for the future. This allowed &quot;Alte Herren&quot; to identify with the active members of their fraternities, and the idea of a lifelong commitment arose (&quot;Lebensbundprinzip&quot;). Soon, the first &quot;Stiftungsfeste&quot;, annual festivities in celebration of the fraternity&#x27;s founding, were celebrated, further cementing their standing. As increased liberty allowed it, a more regulated form of duel was conceived: The modern &quot;Mensur&quot;, which strived to reduce lethality rates while still being able to fence. The former objective, though, was greatly impaired by treatment possibilities, with infected wounds posing a substantial risk.

During this time, the first Christian fraternities were established by religious students missing belief as a basic principle of unity. Although some of them still took up weapons, many refused to do so from an ethical and religious standpoint. They often carried generic names, unifying themselves under an umbrella organization such as the oecumenical &quot;Wingolf&quot; (with &quot;Wingolf Bonn&quot; being the first in 1841).

When the Catholic religion was beginning to be repressed during the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;, a large number of fraternities of Catholic belief were formed as a reaction. The first organization of decidedly Catholic origin was the &quot;Schweizerische Studentenverein&quot; (&quot;Swiss students&#x27; union&quot;) in 1841. These catholic fraternities understood themselves as an important network to counteract the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;.

In 1848, a Germany-wide association of Corps was founded in Bad Kösen, the so-called &quot;Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband&quot;, KSCV, (roughly, &quot;the Kösen association of the committees of the first men in charge&quot;). It consisted solely of the old &quot;Corps&quot; present at traditional liberal arts colleges and excluded those at technical colleges. In reaction, the &quot;Weinheimer Senioren Convent&quot;, WSC, was established, which unified the latter. Today, the two umbrella organizations are tightly linked by a cooperation treaty, known as &quot;Die Corps&quot;.

The types of fraternities soon diversified, and formerly informal clubs, such as sports clubs influenced by the political ideas of Turnvater Jahn (&quot;Turnerschaften&quot;), academic choirs (&quot;Sängerschaften&quot;), and groups influenced by the progressive movement (&quot;Landsmannschaften&quot; after the 17th century organizations) were reorganized. Each with their namesake as their central principle and idea of character building. Landsmannschaft Sorabia-Westfalen Münster is the oldest &quot;Studentenverbindung&quot; of modern constitution. It was founded in 1716 in the City of Leipzig.

A notable exception from these self-centered principles is the VVDSt (&quot;Verband der Vereine Deutscher Studenten&quot;, &quot;union of associations of German students&quot;), which had a strict antisemitic policy and was formed in 1881 as a decidedly political group. As a reaction, the first Jewish fraternities were established in the 1880s, prevailing until the National Socialist regime. Theodor Herzl, the founder of zionism and a former &quot;Burschenschaft&quot; student, was soon made an honorary member in many of these fraternities. Furthermore, Jewish fraternities were heavily focused on emancipating themselves through duel and &quot;Mensur.&quot;

Finally, around the break of the century, women were admitted to visit universities, unifying to sororities in 1899. The first such organization was the &quot;Club der Namenlosen&quot; (&quot;club of the nameless&quot;), that was soon renamed to &quot;Verein Studierender Frauen Deutschlands Hilaritas&quot; (&quot;association of female students of Germany Hilaritas&quot;).

This diversification progressed to the point that the formerly despised students&#x27; culture heavily influenced society, especially affecting the language. During the Wilhelminian Era, this development peaked, with the largest part of the academic community (active or alumni) being member in one or more of the over 1300 fraternities and even non-members cutting themselves with razors to simulate the appearance of the characteristic fencing wounds. As of today, Bismarck and Kaiser Wilhelm II still remain the most well-known of &quot;Corps&quot; students and German fraternity students in general.

=== First World War, Weimar Republic and National Socialist rule ===
This lasted until the first World War, which called all of the active students to serve their country, which many welcomed euphorically. Fatalities substantially reduced the number of fraternity students and students in general. When the war was lost and the Kaiser was forced to step down and hand over the power of state to a democratic government, the fraternities&#x27; world shook in its foundations.

The violence the students had experienced at war, the uncertainty of the Weimar Republic times and the deeply felt humiliation of the harsh conditions of the Peace of Versailles caused many fraternity members to enlist in the newly founded Freikorps, paramilitary organizations thought to protect democracy. As open battles between &quot;Freikorps&quot; members and communist activists began, many quickly radicalized throughout society, resulting in formerly non-political fraternities developing an extreme nationalist, anti-communist and antisemitic standpoint. As this was a fertile ground for the newly founded NSDAP to flourish on, many soon committed themselves to its principles, with some, such as the &quot;Burschenschaft&quot;, expelling Jews as early as 1920.

When the NSDAP seized power in 1933, many rejoiced, although it was soon made clear that &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot; would not be allowed to persist. There are several exceptions, though, most notably the &quot;Corps Saxo-Borussia&quot;, whose members loudly discussed on different occasions if &quot;the fuehrer were to eat his asparagus with his knife, his fork, or his paws&quot;, coming to the conclusion that he had &quot;so large a gab, he would be able to eat it crosswise&quot;.

This led to all &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot; being classified as &quot;reactionary&quot;, and most of them either dissolved themselves or were forcibly closed during 1934 to 1938. The former members were then reorganized in &quot;Kameradschaften&quot; (&quot;comradeships&quot;) and forced to omit their principles of democratic vote, lifelong cooperation, honor and tradition. In secrecy, though, many of the former customs were still practised, although with the outbreak of World War II, few remained to do so during the war.

=== Post-war times ===
After the war, the remaining former members soon tried to reorganize themselves, often fusing two or more &quot;Verbindungen&quot; to allow for greater impact, such as Guestphalia Bonn (West Germany) and Guestphalia Greifswald (East Germany). Although this was at first made illegal by the occupation forces and universities, they slowly gained a foothold in society again (see Corps Suevia). Special influences on this include several court decisions, amongst which are the decision that the &quot;Mensur&quot; does not violate moral code in 1951, that public display of fraternity colors can not be punished by expulsion from the university (1958, so called &quot;Freiburg color dispute&quot;) and the forced acceptance of the last fencing fraternity in Berlin in 1968, and the formal obligation to head of state Theodor Heuss to abolish duels for honor.

One side effect is that, due to this persistent struggle back to acceptance through legal action and sheer will of survival, post war fraternities in Germany, unlike their pre-war selves, did not receive any university funding, but had also become completely free and independent of University regulation or oversight.

While this allowed for progress and such was achieved during the 1950s and early 1960s, the &quot;Verbindungen&quot; again took a hard hit in 1968 with the general socialist sentiment amongst the student movement and their desire to abolish anything deemed reactionary. As of today, many of the prejudices then expressed still form the base of what little is known to the public about &quot;Verbindungen&quot;, resulting in a slow and steady decline in membership count since. A notable upswing was only delivered by the recent Bologna process, depriving students of long known means of studying and thus increasing the demand for assistance by experienced alumni. , a bit less than 1% of German university students are active members of a &quot;Studentenverbindung&quot;.

The most prospering &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot; can still be found in cities and towns with traditional liberal arts colleges and universities like Göttingen, Bonn and Heidelberg in Germany, with Munich being an exception. Traditional structures have mostly been preserved, with rituals, codes of honor, symbols and principles still intact. Most &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot; still are restricted to only one gender, with the male varieties actively practising the &quot;Mensur&quot;. However, many have formally repented their presumed mistakes, with memorials of unjustly excluded Jews, for instance, being a common sight in a &quot;Verbindungshaus&quot;.

== Controversy ==
There are numerous points of critique which are usually discussed without result. The most common include accusations of nationalism, racism, sexism, homophobia, and elitism.
* Nationalism: Based on the historical background of many &quot;Verbindungen&quot;, especially Burschenschaften, having either a strong link to a former princedom or having displayed strong nationalism before these were abolished, the accusation of nationalism is the most frequent, to the harm of the other &quot;Verbindungen&quot;.
* Racism: With long histories of German supremacy and antisemitism, today&#x27;s &quot;Verbindungen&quot; are often said to be prone to structural racism. Supporters, on the other hand, often argue that the evidence is largely anecdotal. The &quot;Burschenschaft&quot;″s criterion of only admitting males &quot;of German culture&quot; often draws criticism, as well. However, the majority of &quot;Verbindungen&quot;, especially Corps, define themselves as tolerant in general, regardless of race, ethnicity or national origin.
* Sexism: As the majority of &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot; are male-only, left-wing student organizations in particular often raise allegations of sexism. This is often combined with the accusation of being elitist, as it restricts women from making use of the same lucrative career networks as males. There is a long list of female-only &quot;Verbindungen&quot; however, with a historic background reaching to 1898, whilst the oldest still active &quot;Verbindung&quot; was founded in 1976.
* Elitism: &quot;Alte Herren&quot; are said to take care of the students&#x27; careers, helping them in their subjects of study and in other areas of life, up to organizing good jobs and opportunities after graduation. This networking is seen as problematic by other students and most students&#x27; unions. Today&#x27;s fraternities dismiss this as a stereotype stemming from the Wilhelminian Era, when fraternities were much more common and a career was near-impossible without their help.

Apart from debate, these accusations have led to numerous acts of politically motivated violence, with over 100 cases in 2010 alone, ranging from simple vandalism such as destroying windows and spraying graffiti, through aggravated assault, to arson endangering fraternity members.

== Common types ==
Despite a wide variety of &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot;, certain kinds are more common:
Symbols: wc=wearing couleur; nc=not wearing couleur in hat or ribbon; pF=practicing academic fencing; fo=academic fencing optional; nF=not practicing academic fencing

Uncommon, but influential are the academical-technical engineering clubs (&quot;Akademischer Verein&quot;) of the &quot;Hütte&quot; and &quot;Miltenberg-Wernigeroder Ring&quot;; the &quot;Hütte&quot; is the publisher of one of the major engineering compendiums in Germany.

<text>Coburger Convent der akademischen Landsmannschaften und Turnerschaften an deutschen Hochschulen (abbreviation: CC) is an association of German and Austrian studentenverbindungen. Its membership includes 91 student associations who all participate in academic fencing. 

== History ==
Coburger Convent was founded in Coburg, Bavaria, Germany on May 12, 1951 as a trade association for studentenverbindungen or student fraternal corporations. It formed from the merger of the German Regional Association and the Representative Convention; these were Landsmannschafter and Turnerschafter gymnastics associations at German universities. 

Coburger Convent held its first nationwide conference in Berlin in 1952; this was held jointly with the German Sängerschaft (now Austrian Landsmannschafter-und Turnerschafter-Convent which is a CC member corporation). This conference continues as the annual Greifenstein Conference held in Bad Blankenburg, Germany. 

As of 2024, Coburger Convent includes 91 corporations in Germany and Austria, consisting of 1,500+ male students and 9,500+ alumni members. It consists of both Landsmannschaften and Turnerschaften student corporations. Each member corporation has a meeting house. Their only membership requirement is to be a student of the corporation&#x27;s university. Alumni members of the corporations belong to the Association of Old Gentlemen of the Coburger Convent. 

Coburger Convent&#x27;s headquarters are located in Munich, Germany. Its publication is &quot;CC Das Magazin&quot;.

== Symbols and traditions ==
Coburger Convent&#x27;s principles or pillars of the association are honor, freedom, friendship, and fatherland. One of the main tradition of the CC studentenverbindungen is participation in compulsory academic fencing.

<doc id="337435" wikidata="Q1771963" url="?curid=337435" title="Naphtali">
<text>According to the Book of Genesis, Naphtali (; ) was the sixth son of Jacob, the second of his two sons with Bilhah. He was the founder of the Israelite tribe of Naphtali.

Some biblical commentators have suggested that the name &quot;Naphtali&quot; may refer to the struggle between Rachel and Leah for the favours of Jacob. Bilhah was the handmaid of Rachel, who was infertile at the time, and had persuaded Jacob to have a child with Bilhah as a proxy for having one with herself.

==Biblical references==
According to the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Naphtali was a swift runner, though this appears to have been inferred from the Blessing of Jacob, which equates Naphtali to a hind. However, Biblical scholars believe this to actually be a description of the tribe of Naphtali.

Naphtali is listed in Deuteronomy 34.2 when God takes Moses up to the mountain of Nebo and shows him the extent of the land which he had promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. See article on Tribe of Simeon for a map of the twelve tribes of Israel.

==Family==
According to , Naphtali had four sons: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. The name of his wife/wives are not given. He and his family migrated to Egypt, with the rest of the clan, where they remained until the Exodus.

According to the apocryphal &quot;Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs&quot;, he died at age 137 and was buried in Egypt.

=== Testament of Naphtali ===

In this apocryphal material, Naphtali gave his sons no commandment except regarding the fear of God, that they should serve Him and follow after Him, also admonished them not to join themselves unto the sons of Joseph but join the sons of Levi and Judah. He also had a vision about the division of tribes of Israel and told to them that Abraham was chosen by God for his faith.

<text>The Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (PAR, Antarctic Pacific Ridge, South Pacific Rise, South Pacific Ridge) is a divergent tectonic plate boundary located on the seafloor of the South Pacific Ocean, separating the Pacific plate from the Antarctic plate. It is regarded as the southern section of the East Pacific Rise in some usages, generally south of the Challenger fracture zone which is associated with a triple junction between the Juan Fernández microplate, the Pacific plate and the Antarctic plate. It stretches from there in a general southwesterly direction to the Macquarie Triple Junction south of New Zealand.

== Tectonics ==
The divergence rate between the two plates along the ridge is believed to vary from about near 65°S to near the Udintsev fracture zone at 55°S. This area of transition in sea floor spreading rate has been mapped by multiple techniques and occurs near the Heirtzler fracture zone.

The ridge is related to the Late Cretaceous breakup of Gondwana. To the southeast the historic Bellingshausen plate separated the Pacific and Antarctic plates between about 84 to 61 million years ago. Until about 33 million years ago, the Proto-Antipodes fracture zone well to the south separated two independent spreading centers, now merged, being the Antarctic–Pacific Ridge and that of the Antarctic–Campbell Plateau.

=== Fracture zones ===
Fracture zones are generally areas of low gravity on the seafloor parallel to a spreading center. The named fracture zones going southwest along the rise, include:
* Challenger fracture zone 
* Menard fracture zone
* Raitt fracture zone
* Heezen fracture zone – northern part of Eltanin fault system which appears continuous to the north with the Louisville Ridge
* Tharp fracture zone – southern part of Eltanin fault system
* George V fracture zone
* Udintsev fracture zone
* Le Géographe fracture zone
* Astronome fracture zone
* Antipodes fracture zone
* Le Petit Prince fracture zone
* Saint-Exupéry fracture zone
* Le Renard fracture zone
* La Rose fracture zone
* Heirtzler fracture zone
** Endeavour fracture zone (offset from Heirtzler fracture zone poorly defined more recently than about 43.5 Ma – Chron 20)
** Pahemo fracture zone (not defined more recently than about 43.5 Ma – Chron 20)
* Pitman fracture zone (initiated as an offset of Kohiku and Pahemo fracture zones around 62.5 Ma – Chron 27)
** Kohiku fracture zone (amalgamates with Pitman more recently than 31 Ma – Chron 12)
* Erebus fracture zone
* Terror fracture zone
* Emerald fracture zone
* Hjort fracture zone

== The Louisville Ridge ==

Stretching for north-west from the Eltanin fault system which intersects the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge to the Osbourn Seamount at Tonga and Kermadec Junction is a long line of seamounts called the Louisville Ridge – the longest such chain in the Pacific – thought to have formed from the Pacific Plate sliding over a long-lived center of upwelling magma called the Louisville hotspot.

<text>A Landsmannschaft (; Latin &quot;natio&quot;, plural nationes) is a German fraternity of several fraternity forms called &quot;Studentenverbindung&quot;.

The older forms of &quot;Landsmannschaften&quot; were part of corporations and are closely aligned with the beginnings of universities in medieval times of the 12th and 13th centuries.

The newer forms of &quot;Landsmannschaften&quot; are a kind of reform corps and most &quot;Landsmannschaften&quot; are members of the Coburger Convent.

This is also the term for a Jewish burial society: landsmanshaft

== History ==

In order to understand the history of German fraternities, it needs to be known that the first universities in Europe were established in the 12th and 13th century in Paris (France), Bologna and Padua (Italy), and later also in Oxford and Cambridge (England). Students joined groups in regards to region in order to have protection as well as support in being heard in their interests. The two early forms were called nations (Nationes) or colleges (Collegien) and organized not only the work but also social life and had major influence in universities as they elected the head of a university (magister) in some areas.

&quot;Landsmannschaften&quot; formerly had the character of guilds. They were loosely organized bodies of students from the same region or nation naturally enough drawn together by their longings for companionship. A good example is the &quot;Mosellanerlandsmannschaft&quot; of the University of Jena. It contained members from the Rhineland, Palatinate, Swabia, and Alsace. The purposes of the organizations in general were:
# to encourage friendship;
# to compel the adjustment of difficulties arising among members;
# to protect a &quot;brother member&quot; against slander or other attack from outsiders;
# to share in social enjoyments;
# to perform friendly services for one another;
# to yield to the will of the majority;
# to obey the president as long as he directs for the best interests of the organization.
By 1786, this code had grown to 86 paragraphs.

<text>Coitus reservatus (from &#x27;, &quot;[[sexual intercourse]]&quot; and&#x27;, &quot;reserved&quot;), also known as sexual continence, is a form of sexual intercourse in which a male does not attempt to ejaculate within his partner, avoiding the seminal emission. It is distinct from death-grip syndrome, wherein a male has no volition in his emissionless state.

Alice Stockham coined the term &quot;karezza&quot;, derived from the Italian word &quot;carezza&quot; meaning &quot;caress&quot;, to describe &quot;coitus reservatus&quot;, but the idea was already in practice at the Oneida Community. Alan Watts erroneously believed that &quot;karezza&quot; was a Persian word. The concept of karezza is loosely akin to &quot;maithuna&quot; in Hindu Tantra and &quot;sahaja&quot; in Hindu Yoga.

Ejaculation control was important for both genders, called Chinese &quot;caiyin buyang&quot; ()( &quot;collect &quot;yin&quot; and replenish &quot;yang&quot;&quot;) for men and &quot;caiyang buyin&quot; () (&quot;collect &quot;yang&quot; and replenish &quot;yin&quot;) for women, and was involved in Taoist sexual practices such as &quot;huanjing bunao&quot;
(), as well as Indian Tantra (where it is known as &quot;asidhārāvrata&quot;&quot;) and Hatha Yoga (see vajroli mudra), although conventional ejaculation is also endorsed.

== Practice of karezza and sexual continence ==
Stockham writes, &quot;Karezza signifies &#x27;to express affection in both words and action&#x27;, and while it fittingly denotes the union that is the outcome of deepest human affection, love&#x27;s consummation, it is used technically throughout this work to designate a controlled sexual union.&quot; So that, in practice, according to Stockham, it is more than just self-control, but mutual control where the penetrative partner helps the receptive partner and vice versa. According to Stockham, this is the key to overcoming many difficulties in controlling sexual expression individually.

Stockham&#x27;s contribution was to apply this same philosophy of orgasm control to women as much as to men. A form of birth control, the technique also prolongs sexual pleasure to the point of achieving mystical ecstasy. In this practice, orgasm is separated from ejaculation, making possible enjoyment of the pleasure of sexual intercourse without experiencing seminal ejaculation, while still experiencing orgasm.

Some would have the principles of karezza applied to masturbation, whereby a person attempts to delay orgasm as long as possible to prolong pleasure in a process known as &quot;orgasmic brinkmanship&quot;, &quot;surfing&quot;, or &quot;edging&quot;, but this is different from the practice of &quot;karezza&quot; in partnered intercourse. In Latin literature, this is known as .

One purpose of karezza is the maintenance and intensification of desire and enjoyment of sexual pleasure within relationships. According to Stockham, it takes from two weeks to a month for the body to recover from ejaculation: &quot;Unless procreation is desired, let the final propagative orgasm be entirely avoided&quot;. Stockham advocated that the &#x27;honeymoon period&#x27; of a relationship could be maintained in perpetuity by limiting the frequency of ejaculations, or, preferably avoiding them entirely.

Kalman Andras Oszlar writes, &quot;Inasmuch as sexual togetherness is not limited into the physical world and does not mean quick wasting of sexual energies, by this we give free way to higher dimensions in the relationship.&quot; Affected by this, we may get into the state of flow, and in the course of this, the couple charges up with energy, while – with focused attention (Dhāraṇā) – the couple is submerging in that in which they are having pleasure. This state of mind is connected with the beneficial effects of tantric restraint and transformation. At first, Mihály Csíkszentmihályi defined positive philosophy, and since then, it has been referred to beyond the professional line. According to the professor, the flow experience is an entirely focused and motivationally intensified experience where people can entirely focus and properly command their feelings for the best performance or learning.

There is a slight difference between karezza and coitus reservatus. In coitus reservatus, unlike karezza, a woman can enjoy a prolonged orgasm while a man exercises self-control.

Like coitus interruptus, coitus reservatus is not a reliable form of preventing a sexually transmitted infection, as the penis leaks pre-ejaculate before ejaculation, which may contain all of the same infectious viral particles and other microbes as the semen. Although studies have not found sperm in pre-ejaculate fluid, the method is also unreliable for contraception because of the difficulty of controlling ejaculation beyond the point of no return. Additionally, pre-ejaculate fluid can collect sperm from a previous ejaculation, leading to pregnancy even when performed correctly.

== Controversy ==

Alice Stockham was taken to court and forced to give up teaching the practice of karezza in the United States. Like many other sex reformers, Dr. Stockham was arrested by Anthony Comstock, who prosecuted a variety of sexual freedom reformers. Ida Craddock committed suicide after being repeatedly jailed for peddling pornography. The press attacked the Oneida Community and Noyes fled to Canada due to a warrant being issued for his arrest on a statutory rape charge on June 22, 1879. From there, he advised others to follow St. Paul&#x27;s plan of either marriage or celibacy, and to obey the commandments against adultery and fornication.

== Views of the Catholic Church ==
Many theologians within the Catholic tradition approve of &quot;coitus reservatus&quot; with precise guidelines.
* In 6.918 of &quot;Moral Theology&quot;, St. Alphonsus Liguori allows it in marriage, if mutual (when both spouses restrain themselves from orgasm), according to citation by author Peter Gardella.
*In 1952, the Holy See warned that:
** John F. Harvey OSFS expressed this to mean that &quot;confessors and spiritual directors should not presume that there is nothing objectionable&quot; with it. This indicates it could become sinful under certain circumstances, for example, if ending in masturbation.
* Masturbation is defined by Fr. John Hardon SJ as:
* In the article hosted on the US Conference of Catholic Bishops website, John F. Harvey OSFS confirmed and explained &quot;coitus reservatus&quot;. The spouses should avoid undue frustration. They must not intend orgasm for either of them. If unintentionally one of them reaches the climax, then they must try to stimulate the other spouse to reach the climax, too.
This differs from non-penetrative, rubbing-only sex (mutual masturbation or manual sex) and differs from &quot;coitus interruptus&quot; because &quot;coitus reservatus&quot; ends with no orgasm at all for both spouses if practiced within guidelines from John F. Harvey OSFS referenced above.

== Oneida Community ==
The Oneida Community, founded in the 19th century by John Humphrey Noyes, experimented with coitus reservatus, which was then called male continence in a religiously Christian communalist environment. The experiment lasted for about a quarter of a century, and then Noyes created Oneida silverware and established the Oneida Silver Co., which grew into Oneida Limited. Noyes identified three functions of the sexual organs: the urinary, the propagative (reproductive), and the amative (sexual love). Noyes believed in the separation of the amative from the propagative, and he put amative sexual intercourse on the same footing as other ordinary forms of social interchange. Sexual intercourse as Noyes defines it is the insertion of the penis into the vagina; ejaculation is not a requirement for sexual intercourse.

== Western esotericism ==
=== Ida Craddock, C. F. Russell, and Louis T. Culling ===

Inspired by Ida Craddock&#x27;s work Heavenly Bridegrooms, American occultist C. F. Russell developed a curriculum of sex magick. In the 1960s, disciple Louis T. Culling published these in two works entitled &quot;The Complete Magickal Curriculum of the Secret Order G.&#x27;.B.&#x27;.G.&#x27;.&quot; and &quot;Sex Magick&quot;. The first two degrees are &quot;Alphaism and Dianism&quot;. Culling writes that Dianism is &quot;sexual congress without bringing it to climax&quot; and that each participant is to regard their partner, not as a &quot;known earthly personality&quot; but as a &quot;visible manifestation of one&#x27;s Holy Guardian Angel.

=== Rosicrucian groups ===
AMORC does not recommend engaging in sexual practices of an occult nature. This has been so since their First Imperator H. Spencer Lewis, Ph.D. made it public knowledge. 

The &quot;Fraternitas Rosae Crucis&quot; led by Dr. R. Swinburne Clymer engages in sexual practices for the sake of race regeneration. Dr. Clymer is completely opposed to the practice of karezza or &quot;coitus reservatus&quot; and advocates instead a form of sexual intercourse in which the couple experiences the orgasm at the same time. 

The Secretary of the FUDOSI instead approved the practice of karezza to establish harmony in the family and the world by preventing the waste and misuse of sex energy.

Dr. Arnold Krumm-Heller established the &quot;Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua&quot; (FRA), a Rosicrucian school in Germany with branches in South America, having the following formula of sexual conduct: &quot;Immissio Membri Virile In Vaginae Sine Ejaculatio Seminis&quot; (Introduce the penis in the vagina without ejaculating the semen). Samael Aun Weor experimented with that formula and developed the doctrine of &quot;The Perfect Matrimony&quot;.

== 20th-century Western writers ==
English novelist Aldous Huxley, in his last novel &quot;Island&quot;, wrote that Maithuna, the Yoga of Love, is &quot;the same as what Roman Catholicism means by &quot;coitus reservatus&quot;.&quot; Getting to the point by discussing &quot;coitus reservatus&quot;, Alan W. Watts in &quot;Nature, Man and Woman&quot; notes: &quot;I would like to see someone make a case for the idea that the Apostles really did hand down an inner tradition to the Church, and that through all these centuries the Church has managed to guard it from the public eye. If so, it has remained far more secret and &#x27;esoteric&#x27; than in any of the other great spiritual traditions of the world, so much so that its existence is highly doubtful&quot;. The Welsh writer Norman Lewis, in his celebrated account of life in Naples in 1944, claimed that San Rocco was the patron saint of coitus reservatus: &quot;I recommended him to drink – as the locals did – marsala with the yolk of eggs stirred into it, and to wear a medal of San Rocco, patron of coitus reservatus, which could be had in any religious-supplies shop&quot;. The psychologist Havelock Ellis writes: &quot;&quot;Coitus Reservatus&quot;, – in which intercourse is maintained even for very long periods, during which a woman may orgasm several times while the penetrative partner succeeds in holding back orgasm – so far from being injurious to a woman, is probably the form of coitus which gives her the maximum gratification and relief&quot;.

==Modern practice of Karezza==
Marina Robinson and her husband Gary Wilson promoted Karezza through books, websites, and media interviews. Robinson&#x27;s book, which she claimed was &quot;researched&quot; by Wilson, was &quot;Peace Between the Sheets&quot;, later renamed &quot;Cupid&#x27;s Poisoned Arrow&quot;. When asked whether Karezza was science-based or spiritual, Robinson claimed Karezza was purely a spiritual practice for transferring sexual &quot;energy&quot;. Robinson described Karezza sex as superior to conventional sex, claiming beliefs that orgasm was an important part of sex reflected brainwashing. Wilson claimed the practice cured his lifelong alcoholism and depression. Another prominent modern Karezza practitioner, Mary Sharpe, claimed the time after orgasm was a time of increased violence, even leading to terrorism, making it necessary to avoid orgasm.

Claims of the semen retention community and those of the NoFap community are among the least accurate concerning men&#x27;s health.

<doc id="337447" wikidata="Q1541137" url="?curid=337447" title="Eastern towhee">
<text>The eastern towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), also known as chewink, joree, or joree bird, is a large New World sparrow. The taxonomy of the towhees has been under debate in recent decades, and formerly this bird and the spotted towhee were considered a single species, the rufous-sided towhee.

Their breeding habitat is brushy areas across eastern North America. They nest either low in bushes or on the ground under shrubs. Northern birds migrate to the southern United States. There has been one record of this species as a vagrant to western Europe: a single bird in Great Britain in 1966.

The song is a short &quot;drink your teeeeea&quot; lasting around one second, starting with a sharp call (&quot;drink!&quot;) and ending with a short trill &quot;teeeeea&quot;. The name &quot;towhee&quot; is onomatopoeic description of one of the towhee&#x27;s most common calls, a short two-part call rising in pitch and sometimes also called a &quot;chewink&quot; call.

==Taxonomy==
The eastern towhee was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; and given the binomial name &quot;Fringilla erythrophthalma&quot;. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Pipilo&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The specific name &quot;erythrophthalmus/erythrophthalma&quot; combines the Ancient Greek words ερυθρος &quot;eruthros&quot; &quot;red&quot; and οφθαλμος &quot;ophthalmos&quot; &quot;eye&quot;.

Four subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. e. erythrophalmus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758), found south-central and southeast Canada to the eastern United States
* &quot;P. e. canaster&quot; (Howell, AH, 1913), found in the interior southeast United States
* &quot;P. e. rileyi&quot; (Koelz, 1939), found in the coastal southeast United States except for central and southern Florida
* &quot;P. e. alleni&quot; (Coues, 1871) found in south and central Florida

==Description==
The eastern towhee is a large and striking species of sparrow. The total length ranges from and the wingspan is . The body of mass of this species ranges from , with an average of . Adults have rufous sides, a white belly, and a long dark tail with white edges. The eyes are red for most populations, though populations in the southeastern U.S. have yellow eyes – often referred to as the &quot;white-eye morph.&quot; Males have a black head, upper body, and tail; these parts are brown in the female. Juveniles are brown overall. Eastern towhees of all ages and both sexes generally are unmistakable. In the Great Plains, eastern towhees will occasionally overlap in range with their sister species, the spotted towhee, which has resulted in rare hybrids between the two species.

==Distribution==
The eastern towhee occurs throughout the eastern United States and southeast Canada. Occurrences from southern Saskatchewan, southwest Ontario and Quebec south to Florida, and west to eastern Texas are noted in a literature review. Populations north of southern New England through northern Indiana and Illinois to southern Iowa primarily are summer residents.

&quot;Pipilo e. erythrophthalmus&quot; occurs in the most northerly part of the eastern towhee&#x27;s distribution in the summer, and in winter migrates to the southern and eastern portion of the range of the species. The other subspecies are largely residents. &quot;Pipilo e. canaster&quot; occurs from south-central Louisiana, north to northeastern Louisiana east through Mississippi, extreme southwestern Tennessee, northern Alabama and Georgia, central South Carolina to western North Carolina, and south to northwestern Florida and east along the Gulf Coast. The range of &quot;P. e. rileyi&quot; extends from northern Florida through southern Georgia and coastal South Carolina to east-central North Carolina. &quot;Pipilo e. alleni&quot; occurs in peninsular Florida.

The eastern towhee occurs in vegetation of disturbed areas, such as old-field successional vegetation and shrubby areas of power line right-of-ways. In northwestern Arkansas, eastern towhees occurred in old-field vegetation where dwarf sumac (&quot;Rhus copallina&quot;) occurred at a frequency of 28.6%, winged elm (&quot;Ulmus alata&quot;) at a frequency of 21%, and black cherry (&quot;Prunus serotina&quot;) at a frequency of 19.2%. Shrubby vegetation along power lines is commonly used by eastern towhees. For example, in Maryland, eastern towhee territories along a power line right-of-way corresponded with shrubby areas containing species such as Allegheny blackberry (&quot;Rubus allegheniensis&quot;) and blueberry (&quot;Vaccinium&quot; spp.). Other species included hawthorn (&quot;Crataegus&quot; spp.), red maple (&quot;Acer rubrum&quot;), black cherry, and black locust (&quot;Robinia pseudoacacia&quot;).

From 1966 to 2015, the eastern towhee experienced a greater than 1.5% annual population decrease throughout the Atlantic seaboard and the northern part of its breeding range.

==Timing of major life events==
Arrival and departure of eastern towhees into summer breeding grounds varies with location. According to a literature review, eastern towhees typically arrive in New York in early April and leave by the middle of November. A review of eastern towhees in New Hampshire describes arrival in late April to May with the majority departing in September. Further south, on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, migration to high-elevation areas within the Great Smoky Mountains begins as early as March. Eastern towhees typically leave these sites in October. The &quot;Pipilo e. erythrophthalmus&quot; subspecies is the most migratory of the subspecies.

Breeding begins in spring and continues to late summer. Reports of eastern towhees nesting as early as late March in Florida and Georgia, in mid- to late April in some midwestern states, and as late as mid-May in northern New England were summarized in a literature review. Literature reviews also report nest construction by the female, which takes about three to five days. Egg laying typically occurs until August. For example, a review of eastern towhees in Indiana notes nesting from 15 April to 20 August. However, a literature review of eastern towhees in Florida included a report of a nest observed on 2 September 1983 that contained two eggs. According to several literature reviews, eastern towhees may renest after failed nesting attempts and can raise two, and in the south sometimes three, broods per season.

In a literature review, Greenlaw reports mean breeding territory size of (range , n=24) in a mesic oak (&quot;Quercus&quot; species) forest where eastern towhees occurred at a density of 21 males/40 ha. In a xeric pine (&quot;Pinus&quot; species)-oak woodland where the eastern towhee density was 32 males/40 ha, mean eastern towhee territory size was (range , n=20). In Massachusetts, mean male eastern towhee territory size was about , and female eastern towhee territory size was . Territory size changed over the course of the breeding season and was not significantly (p&gt;0.05) affected by reductions in food availability of 30% or less. During the winter eastern towhees are not as territorial and may be seen in mixed species flocks. Daily movement of eastern towhees in loblolly (P. taeda) and longleaf pine (P. palustris) forests and clearcuts in South Carolina averaged per day. Only 2 females, out of 11 females and 9 males, stayed within the stand where they were captured for the duration of a 10-week study.

Eastern towhees have fairly strong fidelity to breeding territories. In an oak forest in New Jersey, adult eastern towhee return rates were 20% the 1st year after banding and 43% in subsequent years. Between 1960 and 1967, the maximum number of eastern towhee returns to the site was 5. In a Pennsylvania woodlot observed between 1962 and 1967, an eastern towhee returned to the site for 4 consecutive years.

Several reviews report eastern towhee clutch sizes from 2 to 6 eggs, with means ranging from 2.45 to 3.6 eggs per nest. All 5 eastern towhee nests on Sanibel Island, Florida, contained 3 eggs. Eastern towhees in 2 pitch pine (&quot;P. rigida&quot;) barrens sites in New Jersey and New York had a later median egg laying date (mid-June) and significantly (p&lt;0.05) smaller average early nest clutch sizes (NJ=2.67, NY=3.25) than those in an oak-hickory (&quot;Carya&quot; spp.) site, which had a median egg-laying date in early June and an average early nest clutch size of 3.88. Food availability likely explains at least some of the differences between the 2 habitat types. Eggs are incubated by the female for 12 or 13 days. After hatching both parents feed the young, which fledge 10 to 12 days later and are dependent on parental care for about another month.

A wide range of eastern towhee nest success values have been reported. On Sanibel Island, 1 of the 5 eastern towhee nests observed was successful. In Louisiana, average daily nest success rate was 95.3% on a bottomland hardwood forest site. The same study found a 92.6% average daily nest success rate in a 6-year-old managed cottonwood (&quot;Populus&quot; spp.) plantation in Alabama. Average eastern towhee nest success across mixed bigtooth (&quot;P. grandidentata&quot;) and quaking aspen (&quot;P. tremuloides&quot;) stands of varying ages in Pennsylvania was 48.1%. In South Carolina, only 1 of 10 nests was successful, and the mean daily nest survival rate was 62.9%. This low value was explained by high levels of predation. Due to lower nest success rates of Bachman&#x27;s sparrow (&quot;Aimophila aestivalis&quot;) than the previous year, it is suggested that eastern towhee nest success may have been measured during a comparatively poor year.

Compared to nests, adult towhee survival rates are high. Average weekly adult survival rate of eastern towhees in a South Carolina study area was 99.3%. This rate was obtained from radio-marked eastern towhees and represented the pooled survival of both sexes and from 2 South Carolina sites, young and mature stands of loblolly and longleaf pine. Between 1962 and 1967 in Pennsylvania, annual survival of breeding eastern towhees calculated from mistnetting recaptures was 58%. According to a literature review, both males and females become reproductively mature in their second year. Eastern towhees of over 12 years old have been reported in the wild.

==Preferred habitat==
Eastern towhees range from near sea level to as high as along the border of Tennessee and North Carolina during the summer. A literature review reports eastern towhees up to in New Hampshire.

Eastern towhees spend the majority of their time near the ground. For instance, in Pennsylvania in spring, observations of eastern towhees below from the ground occurred significantly (p&lt;0.05) more than expected based on random spatial distribution, and observations above occurred significantly (p&lt;0.05) less than would be expected. In a Louisiana bottomland forest 62% of eastern towhee observations were within of the ground, and only 4% were observed above . In the spring this changed, with detections of eastern towhees below declining from 70% to 65% and detections in the canopy (&gt;) increasing from 4% to 7%.

Eastern towhees occur in many habitats, from tallgrass prairies and marshes to mature forests. However, eastern towhees are most common in early successional stands, habitat edges, and areas with similar vegetation structure throughout eastern forests.

In most communities eastern towhees are more abundant in young successional stands. Several studies found increased eastern towhee abundance on early successional sites compared to later-successional sites. Mean number of breeding eastern towhees (0.70 bird/50-m radius) and nest success rate (58%) were higher in a 15-year-old clearcut in West Virginia, than in other treatments, including a stand of yellow-poplar (&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;), black cherry, red maple, sugar maple (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot;), and white ash (&quot;Fraxinus americana&quot;) that was not harvested. In a southern Missouri oak-hickory forest, eastern towhees were not present before clearcutting or in the nearby uncut forest after cutting, but occurred at a mean density of 9.3 birds/10 ha in a 3-year-old clearcut. A study of stands of varying ages in central New York found that eastern towhee density peaked in early successional stands.

Although eastern towhees generally prefer young successional sites, variation between habitat types and years has been observed. Krementz and Powell found higher relative abundance of eastern towhee in young (2–6 years old) stands of loblolly and longleaf pine than mature (32–98 years old) stands when investigated in 1995. However, in stands compared in 1996, the 95% confidence intervals of eastern towhee relative abundance on the 2 sites had a substantial degree of overlap. The degree to which eastern towhee responds to succession is influenced by habitat. For example, in Pennsylvania there was a significant (p&lt;0.05) difference between eastern towhee densities (number/10 ha) between mature mixed-oak forest and stands that had been clearcut about 5 years previously. However, eastern towhee densities did not differ significantly between a 1-year-old mixed aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides, P. grandidentata&quot;) clearcut, a 5-year-old aspen clearcut, and a mature aspen stand. Eastern towhee abundance has been shown to peak at different times in different habitats. For instance, although in central hardwood forests eastern towhees were most abundant in regenerating stands, in loblolly and shortleaf pine forest they were most common in pole timber and mature stands. In addition, Bell and Whitmore concluded that early successional is likely too broad a term for describing optimal towhee habitat, since high density of small trees was negatively associated with eastern towhee density in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia.

Eastern towhees seem to prefer sites with characteristics generally associated with early successional vegetation, such as low canopy cover and dense understory. Negative correlations between eastern towhee abundance and various measurements of overstory density have been found in several studies. Average density of eastern towhees across 6 habitat types in Pennsylvania was significantly (p&lt;0.05) negatively correlated with density of overstory trees and basal area of overstory trees. Number of eastern towhees in a western Virginia hardwood forest was also significantly (p&lt;0.05) inversely correlated with total percent canopy cover. In a loblolly pine forest in South Carolina, the average number of eastern towhee breeding territories per experimental unit was significantly (p≤0.008) negatively correlated with mid-story () pine (&quot;Pinus&quot; spp.) and deciduous volume.

Many studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between eastern towhee abundance and understory density. In a loblolly pine forest in South Carolina, understory () pine volume was significantly (p&lt;0.001) positively correlated with the average number of eastern towhee territories per experimental unit. Yahner found the average density of eastern towhees over 6 habitat types was significantly (p&lt;0.05) positively correlated with density of short (2–5-foot (0.5–1.5 m)) shrubs. In east-central Florida slash pine (&quot;P. elliottii&quot;) flatwoods with understories dominated by myrtle oak (&quot;Q. myrtifolia&quot;) and sand live oak (&quot;Q. geminata&quot;) and in scrub sites with scattered slash pine and cabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto), eastern towhee densities were significantly (p=0.01) negatively correlated with mean shrub height.

Eastern towhees may associate with and avoid certain plants. In Nevada, Towhees seem to prefer a habitat in which they are camouflaged such as flowering quince which matches their rufous coloration. In riparian vegetation in Iowa, eastern towhee density was significantly (p≤0.01) positively associated with total plant and vine species richness and negatively correlated with forb and deciduous tree species richness. In West Virginia, eastern towhees were associated with plant species that occurred on drier ridgetops, such as blackberry (p&lt;0.02), black cherry (p&lt;0.002), and black locust (p&lt;0.04). These sites tended to have open canopies and low tree density. Eastern towhee density was negatively associated with plants of the moister parts of this study area, such as black tupelo (&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot;, p&lt;0.006), red maple (p&lt;0.001), and witch hazel (p&lt;0.03). In central New Jersey eastern towhees were significantly (p=0.03) more abundant in gray dogwood (&quot;Cornus racemosa&quot;) shrubland than either eastern redcedar (&quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot;) or multiflora rose (&quot;Rosa multiflora&quot;) shrublands.
Nesting habitat: Eastern towhees typically nest on or near the ground. Several literature reviews note the predominance of eastern towhee nests below . In a study of cowbird parasitism on Sanibel Island, all 5 eastern towhee nests located were within of the ground. Nests as high as have been reported in literature reviews. Nests higher off the ground in mixed aspen stands of varying ages in Pennsylvania had significantly (p&lt;0.001) lower nest success. Of 13 unsuccessful eastern towhee nests, 11 were greater than above the ground.

In West Virginia, there were no significant (p&gt;0.05) differences in habitat surrounding successful and unsuccessful nests. Large snags (≥9 inches diameter at breast height (≥22.9 cm)) did not have an effect on nesting success. Nesting success was not significantly (p&gt;0.05) affected by stand age or distance to edge in even-aged mixed-aspen stands in Pennsylvania.

Eastern towhees nest in a variety of species including grape and blueberry (&quot;Vaccinium&quot; spp.). The majority of nests observed in South Carolina loblolly and longleaf pine forests and clearcuts were located in grape, tree sparkleberry (&quot;V. arboreum&quot;), and oak (&quot;Quercus&quot; spp.). On an oak-hickory site in West Virginia, 27% of 41 eastern towhee nests were found in grape, 17% in blackberry (&quot;Rubus&quot; spp.), 12% in greenbrier (&quot;Smilax&quot; spp.), and 12% in mountain-laurel (&quot;Kalmia latifolia&quot;). Nests also occurred in Virginia creeper (&quot;Parthenocissus quinquefolia&quot;), spice bush (&quot;Lindera benzoin&quot;), and azalea (&quot;Rhododendron&quot; spp.). In a power line right-of-way in Pennsylvania, the 6 eastern towhee nests observed occurred in Allegheny blackberry, witch-hazel (&quot;Hamamelis virginiana&quot;), blueberry (&quot;Vaccinium&quot; spp.), white oak (&quot;Q. alba&quot;), eastern hayscented fern (&quot;Dennstaedtia punctilobula&quot;) and sweetfern (&quot;Comptonia peregrina&quot;) combined, and on ground level. According to literature reviews, eastern towhee nests located on the ground are embedded in litter in dry areas and typically occur at the base of grasses, forbs, low shrubs, or small trees.

Foraging habitat: Selection of foraging habitat by eastern towhees has been investigated in Massachusetts and New Jersey. When gleaning in a southeastern Massachusetts pitch pine barren, eastern towhees preferred species such as pitch pine, bear oak (&quot;Q. ilicifolia&quot;), and other deciduous trees, mainly oaks. Ericaceous species were avoided. Use differed significantly (p&lt;0.001) from availability. On 2 New Jersey sites, eastern towhee foraging preference switched over the course of the breeding season. On a site dominated by oaks, primarily black oak (&quot;Q. velutina&quot;), eastern towhees used oaks in May, as would be expected due to their density. However, in June and July, as relative arthropod biomass declined in oaks, use of oaks was less than would be expected. On a pitch pine-dominated site, use of oaks (primarily bear oak and blackjack oak, &quot;Q. marilandica&quot;) was greater than would be expected in May, but was proportionate to availability in June and July. These negative correlations between date and oak use were significant (p&lt;0.025) for both sites. Use of the oak-dominated site also decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) through the summer.

Effects of spatial area: Eastern towhees appear to prefer edge habitats in many areas. For instance, the mean abundance of eastern towhees in a baldcypress (&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;) in northern Florida was 18, while eastern towhees did not occur in either the baldcypress forest or the clearcut. At the interface of the baldcypress stand and a 13-year-old planted slash pine stand, mean abundance of eastern towhees was 22 breeding birds, while in the planted slash pine stand the average abundance was 15 breeding birds. Density of eastern towhees was found to decline with distance from the edge of a power line right-of-way and an oak-hickory forest in eastern Tennessee. At the edge, eastern towhees occurred at a density of just over 10 pairs/40 ha, while from the edge eastern towhee density had dropped to 1 pair/40 ha. In addition, in experimentally clearcut Pennsylvanian forests composed of white oak, northern red oak (&quot;Q. rubra&quot;), chestnut oak (&quot;Q. prinus&quot;), scarlet oak (&quot;Q. coccinea&quot;), red maple, quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen, and pitch pine, male towhees were detected significantly (p&lt;0.05) more often than expected in the areas where the spatial arrangement of clearcuts was most patchy.

Several studies have addressed the effect of the size of habitat patches on eastern towhees. In mixed-oak forest in New Jersey, eastern towhee frequency generally increased with patch size, although eastern towhees were detected in all plot sizes () except 0.02–acre (0.01 ha) plots. On a site in South Carolina, eastern towhee frequency of occurrence increased as clearcut size increased from &lt; to clearcut sizes from 21 to about 32 acres (8.5–12.8 ha). On another site eastern towhee frequency declined as clearcut size increased from . Eastern towhees bred in only those riparian vegetation patches in Iowa that were at least wide. In southern and eastern Pennsylvania eastern towhee nest success was not significantly (p≥0.10) different on sites with gradual edges and those with more distinct edges between &quot;wildlife habitat openings&quot; and oak-hickory forest.

==Food habits==
Eastern towhees primarily eat on the ground, although they also glean from vegetation. In a southeastern Massachusetts pitch pine barren, 73.5% of male and 80.4% of female foraging observations were on the ground. When foraging on the ground eastern towhees use a scratching technique where both feet kick back simultaneously. In a laboratory study 4 eastern towhees used this method to successfully obtain seed buried almost deep. When foraging above ground the majority of time is spent gleaning foliage. In Massachusetts, 22.5% of male and 16.3% of female foraging observations were of food being gleaned from foliage. Eastern towhees were also observed gleaning from twigs, branches, and trunks. When gleaning, eastern towhees occurred significantly (p&lt;0.01) more often on the distal half of tree branches compared to using distal and proximal portions equally. In 0.5% of male and 0.3% of female foraging observations, eastern towhees hovered. Eastern towhees were never observed catching food out of the air.

Eastern towhees eat a variety of plant and animal matter. In literature reviews, eastern towhees are reported to eat seeds and fruits, several invertebrates, and occasionally small amphibians, snakes, and lizards. Reviews report eastern towhees foraging at feeders. Reviews show that animal matter makes up a larger proportion of the diet in the breeding season. In fall and winter, plants make up 79% and 85% of the diet, respectively. This drops to 53% in spring and 43% in summer. Insects such as beetles (Coleoptera), grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera), ants, wasps, and bees (Hymenoptera), and moths and caterpillars (Lepidoptera) are common prey items. Eastern towhees eat other invertebrates such as spiders (Araneae), millipedes (Diplopoda), centipedes (Chilopoda), and snails (Gastropoda) to a lesser extent. Plants that comprise at least 5% of the eastern towhee diet include ragweed (&quot;Ambrosia&quot; spp.), oak, smartweed (&quot;Polygonum&quot; spp.), and corn (Zea mays) in the Northeast and blackberry, oak, panicgrass (&quot;Panicum&quot; spp.), ragweed, and wax-myrtle (&quot;Morella cerifera&quot;) in the Southeast.

==Predators==
Many animals prey on eastern towhees and their eggs, including reptiles, mammals, and birds. A literature review summarizes several reports demonstrating that predators are a major cause of nest failure. The highest nest predation rate noted was 88% in a New York study. Mammals that are likely nest predators include northern raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), domestic cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), and eastern chipmunks (&quot;Tamias striatus&quot;). Snakes such as bullsnakes (&quot;Pituophis catenifer&quot;), rat snakes (&quot;Elaphe&quot; spp.) and garter snakes (&quot;Thamnophis&quot; spp.) have been reported eating eastern towhee eggs. Weasels (&quot;Mustela&quot; spp.) and blue jays (&quot;Cyanocitta cristata&quot;) are also likely nest predators. Several birds are known to prey on both young and adult eastern towhees, including northern goshawk (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;), Broad-winged (&quot;Buteo platypterus&quot;), short-tailed (&quot;Buteo brachyurus&quot;), sharp-shinned (&quot;Accipiter striatus&quot;) and Cooper&#x27;s hawks (&quot;Accipiter cooperii&quot;). Other predators include barred (&quot;Strix varia&quot;), short-eared (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;) and eastern screech-owls (&quot;Megascops asio&quot;) and even the loggerhead shrike (&quot;Lanius ludovicianus&quot;), which is scarcely larger than a towhee. At least some mammals also feed on adult eastern towhees. In Maryland, an eastern towhee was found in the stomach contents of a red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;).

Brown-headed cowbirds (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;) parasitize eastern towhee nests. In a South Carolina old field, 5 of 19 eastern towhee nests were parasitized. Each parasitized nest contained 1 Brown-headed Cowbird egg. The desertion rate for parasitized nests was 20%, which was similar to nests that had not been parasitized (21%). Two of the five Brown-headed Cowbird eggs produced fledglings. The study did not determine if there was a difference in nest success between parasitized and nonparasitized nests. In West Virginia, only 3 of 41 eastern towhee nests were parasitized by the Brown-headed Cowbird. Average number of fledged young in nonparasitized nests was 2.8, which was similar to the average of 2.7 fledglings per parasitized nest. In a Pennsylvania study site, only 2 of 36 nests were parasitized and both produced eastern towhee fledglings. In a study of nest parasitism on Sanibel Island, none of 5 eastern towhee nests found were parasitized.

<text>Giuseppe Henry &quot;Pino&quot; Palladino (born 17 October 1957) is a Welsh musician, songwriter, and record producer. A session bassist, he has played bass for a number of acts such as the Who, the John Mayer Trio, Gary Numan, Paul Young, Don Henley, David Gilmour, Go West, Tears for Fears, Nine Inch Nails, Jeff Beck, Adele and D&#x27;Angelo.

== Early life ==
The son of a Welsh mother and Italian father (from Campobasso), Giuseppe Henry Palladino was born in Cardiff on 17 October 1957. He attended a Catholic school. He began playing guitar at age 14 and bass guitar at 17. He bought his first fretless bass one year later, playing mostly R&amp;B, funk and reggae with a rock and roll backbeat.

==Career==
Pino Palladino was drawn to Motown and jazz at an early age, and took classical guitar lessons. He liked Led Zeppelin and Yes and started a rock band.

In 1982, Palladino recorded with Gary Numan on the album &quot;I, Assassin&quot;. Following this, he was asked to contribute to Paul Young&#x27;s debut album. Young&#x27;s cover version of &quot;Wherever I Lay My Hat (That&#x27;s My Home)&quot; by Marvin Gaye became a hit in Europe, and Palladino subsequently joined Young&#x27;s band, the Royal family. He received offers to record with Joan Armatrading, Go West, and David Gilmour. He cites as early influences James Jamerson, Danny Thompson, and Norman Watt-Roy and also admires Jaco Pastorius, Stanley Clarke, Bootsy Collins, Larry Graham, Michael Henderson, Anthony Jackson, Marcus Miller, and Rocco Prestia.

In 1988/89, Palladino played on the Don Henley album &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot; on three tracks, including the single &quot;New York Minute&quot;. In 1989 he participating in the recording of Ryuichi Sakamoto&#x27;s album &quot;Beauty&quot;, and was part of the lineup who played with the Japanese musician at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1991.

In 1990, he played on Mike Lindup&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Changes&quot;, with Dominic Miller on guitar and Manu Katché on drums. In 1991, he joined the Law with Paul Rodgers, formerly of Bad Company, and drummer Kenney Jones, who succeeded Keith Moon in the Who after Moon died, and recorded the album &quot;The Law.&quot;

In the 1990s, Palladino alternated between fretless bass and fretted 4-string and 6-string bass. He played with Melissa Etheridge, Richard Wright, Elton John, and Eric Clapton. 

In 1999, he began working with Richard Ashcroft of the Verve on Ashcroft&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Alone With Everybody&quot;. 

Also in the late 1990s, Palladino and the neo-soul artist D&#x27;Angelo developed a connection over their mutual love of Motown and other classic soul music. Palladino then became active in the Soulquarians, playing on the majority of their discography and serving as a member of the Soultronics touring band that supported D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s &quot;Voodoo&quot; tour.

Palladino played with Simon and Garfunkel on their Old Friends reunion tour from 2003 to 2004.

After the Who&#x27;s bassist John Entwistle died the night before the start of their first tour in two years, Palladino became the band&#x27;s bass guitarist on tour. In 2006, he joined the remaining band members on their first album in twenty-four years, &quot;Endless Wire&quot;. He played with the Who at the Super Bowl XLIV half-time show in 2010 with Simon Townshend on guitar, Zak Starkey on drums, and John &quot;Rabbit&quot; Bundrick on keyboards. In 2012, he toured with the Who on their &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; revival. He stopped touring with the Who in 2016, but is still occasionally involved in studio sessions, appearing on their 2019 album titled &quot;Who&quot;.

Palladino met Steve Jordan in the mid-1980s while both were working as session musicians, which blossomed into a friendship. Jordan credits Palladino&#x27;s apparent ability to &quot;feel&quot; changes in music, through melodies, basslines, and an embrace of genres of nearly every kind. According to Jordan, he had planned to meet up with John Mayer and Willie Weeks in January 2005 to perform &quot;Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope&quot; for victims of the tsunami that struck southeast Asia. Weeks was unable to make the performance, and Jordan suggested Palladino, who had heard some of Mayer&#x27;s work and was willing to come. Beginning a set that included the Jimi Hendrix song &quot;Bold as Love&quot;, the three found a chemistry together. They recorded an album and toured as a trio. 

Palladino and Jordan released the album &quot;Try!&quot;, on 22 November 2005. The eleven-track live album includes cover versions of &quot;Wait Until Tomorrow&quot; by Jimi Hendrix and &quot;I Got a Woman&quot; by Ray Charles, two songs from Mayer&#x27;s album &quot;Heavier Things&quot;, and new songs by Mayer. In addition, Mayer, Palladino, and Jordan are credited as songwriters on three songs: &quot;Good Love Is on the Way&quot;, &quot;Vultures&quot;, and &quot;Try!&quot;. Palladino appeared on Mayer&#x27;s third album &quot;Continuum&quot;, fourth album &quot;Battle Studies&quot; and seventh album &quot;The Search for Everything&quot;.

In March and April 2006, Palladino toured with Jeff Beck and played with J. J. Cale, and Eric Clapton on their 2006 album &quot;The Road to Escondido&quot;. In 2009, he formed a trio with keyboardist Philippe Saisse and Simon Phillips.

In January 2011, he entered the studio with D&#x27;Angelo to finish recording &quot;Black Messiah&quot;. In 2013, he played on the Nine Inch Nails album &quot;Hesitation Marks&quot; and was a member of the touring band. Additionally, he co-produced José James&#x27; album &quot;No Beginning No End&quot; (2013).

In 2024, he appeared on II Most Wanted, the third single off of Beyoncé&#x27;s album, &quot;Cowboy Carter&quot;, additionally featuring Miley Cyrus.

==Technique and equipment==
Palladino is noted for his use of the fretless bass on many albums. While it was typical for a bass in a commercial track to have a rather generic sound and stay &quot;playing the low notes&quot;, Palladino preferred a different sound, combining fretless tone with an octaver effect, and basslines that frequently added chords, lead lines, and counter-melodies in the higher range of the instrument. Typical of this style was his playing on Paul Young&#x27;s &quot;Wherever I Lay My Hat&quot;. His equipment at that time included a fretless 1979 Music Man StingRay Bass and Boss octave pedal (OC-2).

From the 1990s onward, Palladino has leaned mainly towards a Fender Precision Bass. He used his 1963 Sunburst Fender Precision on &quot;Voodoo&quot;, using heavy gauge LaBella strings (tuned down to DGCF), a foam mute, and an Ampeg B-15 amplifier. He has also played Fender Jaguar Bass, Lakland Jazz Bass, and Larry Graham Signature JJ-4B Bass.

The Fender Pino Palladino Signature Precision Bass is modeled after two of Pino&#x27;s Fender Precision Basses. The body features faded fiesta red paint over desert sand paint, based on Palladino&#x27;s 1961 Precision Bass, while the neck shape and round-lam rosewood fretboard are based on his 1963 sunburst Precision Bass.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Pino married Marilyn &quot;Maz&quot; Roberts, a member of Paul Young&#x27;s vocal group, the Fabulous Wealthy Tarts. They have three children: Fabiana, Giancarla, and Rocco, who are all involved in the music industry.

<text>More Than You Think You Are is the third studio album by American rock band Matchbox Twenty, released on November 19, 2002. The album is again a departure for the band as it has more of a focus on harder rock than the band&#x27;s two previous albums. Five singles were released from the album: &quot;Disease&quot;, &quot;Unwell&quot;, &quot;Bright Lights&quot;, &quot;Downfall&quot;, and &quot;All I Need&quot;. &quot;Downfall&quot; was released only in the United States while &quot;All I Need&quot; was issued only in Australia.

==Recording==
Produced by the band&#x27;s longtime studio collaborator Matt Serletic, &quot;More Than You Think You Are&quot; was recorded at Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York and at The Hit Factory in New York City.

Rob Thomas was pleased with the album, saying: &quot;This is probably the most rockin&#x27; record we&#x27;ve ever done, because we&#x27;ve been working with Greg Collins, who&#x27;s engineered bands like System of a Down and Red Hot Chili Peppers, and mixer Jim Scott, who&#x27;s worked with people like Wilco and Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers. But at the same time, there&#x27;s a warmness to the record, a real organic quality that I just love.&quot;

==Release==
The album debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 178,000 copies sold. Although not as commercially successful as the band&#x27;s two earlier records, &quot;Yourself or Someone Like You&quot; and &quot;Mad Season&quot;, it had a large radio presence and produced three consecutive singles in the United States, all of them charting onto the top 30 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The album was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 2004 Grammy Awards, losing to the Foo Fighters&#x27; &quot;One by One&quot;. Following the album&#x27;s release, the group took a hiatus to allow the members to focus on other projects, like Thomas&#x27;s solo career. The following year, rhythm guitarist Adam Gaynor left the band in 2005.

<text>Academic fencing () or  is the traditional kind of fencing practiced by some student corporations () in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Latvia, Estonia, and, to a minor extent, in Belgium, Lithuania, and Poland. It is a traditional, strictly regulated épée fight between two male members of different fraternities with sharp weapons. The German technical term (from Latin meaning &#x27;dimension&#x27;) in the 16th century referred to the specified distance between each of the fencers.

== Technique ==

Modern academic fencing, the , is neither a duel nor a sport. It is a traditional way of training and educating character and personality; thus, in a bout, there is neither winner nor loser. In contrast to sports fencing, the participants stand their ground at a fixed distance. At the beginning of the tradition, duelers wore only their normal clothing (as duels sometimes would arise spontaneously) or light-cloth armor on the arm, torso, and throat. In recent years, fencers are protected by mail or padding for the body, fencing arm, fencing hand (gauntlet) and the throat, completed by steel goggles with a nose guard. In Austria and Switzerland, a nose guard is uncommon. Opponents fence at arm&#x27;s length and stand more or less in one place, while attempting to hit the unprotected areas of their opponent&#x27;s face and head. Flinching or dodging is not allowed, the goal being less to avoid injury than to endure it stoically. Two physicians are present (one for each opponent) to attend to injuries and stop the fight if necessary.

The participants, or , use specially developed swords. The so-called (or simply ) exists in two versions. The most common weapon is the with a basket-type guard. Some universities use the so-called (), which is equipped with a bell-shaped guard. These universities are Leipzig, Berlin, Greifswald, Dresden, Tharandt (in the Forestry College, which is now part of Technische Universität Dresden), Halle on the Saale, Frankfurt-an-der-Oder, and Freiberg. In Jena, both and are used. from some western cities use because their tradition had its origin in one of the eastern universities but moved to West Germany after World War II.

The scar resulting from a hit is called a &quot;smite&quot; (), and was seen as a badge of honour, especially in the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th. Nowadays the presence of scars usually indicates a mistake and therefore are no longer considered especially dignified. Today, it is not easy for an outsider to identify Mensur scars due to better medical treatment. Also, the number of mandatory Mensuren was reduced in the second half of the 20th century. Most Mensur scars are located on the left temple of the forehead. Scars on the cheek and chin are rather uncommon today and sometimes due to accidents.

==History==


Starting in Spain at the end of the 15th century, the dueling sword (rapier) became a regular part of the attire of noblemen throughout Europe. In the Holy Roman Empire, this became usual among students, as well. Brawling and fighting were regular occupations of students in the German-speaking areas during the early modern period. In line with developments in the aristocracy and the military, regulated duels were introduced to the academic environment, as well. The basis of this was the conviction that being a student meant being something different from the rest of the population. Students wore special clothes, developed special kinds of festivities, sang student songs, and fought duels, sometimes spontaneously (so-called , French &quot;meeting&quot; or &quot;combat&quot;), sometimes according to strict regulations called (French &quot;how&quot;). The weapons used were the same as those employed in civilian dueling, being at first the rapier and later the smallsword (court sword, dress sword, , ), which was seen as part of the dress and always at hand as a side arm.

Student life was quite unsafe in these years, especially in the 16th and 17th centuries during the Reformation wars and the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), when a major part of the German population was killed. Public life was brutal and students killing each other in the street was not uncommon.

A major step towards civilization was the introduction of the &quot;regulated&quot; duel, of which the first recordings exist from the 17th century. The fight was not decided on the spot, but the time and location were appointed and negotiations were done by officials. A so-called did the arrangements and a &quot;second&quot; represented the interests of the fighter during the duel and could even give physical protection from illegal actions. A kind of referee was present to make decisions, and eventually, the practice of having an attending doctor became normal so as to give medical help in case of an injury.

At the end of the 18th century (after the French Revolution), wearing weapons in everyday life fell out of fashion and was more and more forbidden, even for students. This certainly reduced the number of spontaneous duels dramatically. The regulated duel remained in use, though still forbidden.

The foil was invented in France as a training weapon in the middle of the 18th century to practice fast and elegant thrust fencing. Fencers blunted the point by wrapping a foil around the blade or fastening a knob on the point (&quot;blossom&quot;, ). In addition to practising, some fencers took away the protection and used the sharp foil for duels. German students took up that practice and developed the (&quot;Parisian&quot;) thrusting small sword for the (&quot;thrusting mensur&quot;). After the dress sword was abolished, the became the only weapon for academic thrust fencing in Germany.

Since fencing on thrust with a sharp point is quite dangerous, many students died from their lungs being pierced (), which made breathing difficult or impossible. However, the counter-movement had already started in Göttingen in the 1760s. Here the was invented, the predecessor of the modern , a new weapon for cut fencing. In the following years, the was invented in east German universities for cut fencing as well.

Thrust fencing (using ) and cut fencing (using or ) existed in parallel in Germany during the first decades of the 19th century—with local preferences. Thrust fencing was especially popular in Jena, Erlangen, Würzburg, and Ingolstadt/Landshut, two towns where the predecessors of Munich University were located. The last thrust is recorded to have taken place in Würzburg in 1860.

Until the first half of the 19th century, all types of academic fencing can be seen as duels, since all fencing with sharp weapons was about honour. No combat with sharp blades took place without a formal insult. Compared to pistol duels, these events were relatively harmless. The fight regularly ended when a contestant received a wound at least one inch long that produced at least one drop of blood. It was not uncommon for students to have fought approximately 10 to 30 duels of that kind during their university years. The German student Fritz Bacmeister is the 19th-century record holder, due to his estimated 100 mensur bouts fought in Göttingen, Jena, and Würzburg between 1860 and 1866.
In the 20th and 21st century it was Alexander Kliesch (Landsmannschaft Brandenburg Berlin) with 70.

For duels with nonstudents, e.g., military officers, the &quot;academic sabre&quot; became usual, apparently derived from the military sabre. It was a heavy weapon with a curved blade and a hilt similar to the .

During the first half of the 19th century and some of the 18th century, students believed the character of a person could easily be judged by watching him fight with sharp blades under strict regulations. Academic fencing was more and more seen as a kind of personality training by showing countenance and fairness even in dangerous situations. Student corporations demanded their members fight at least one duel with sharp blades during their university time. The problem was that some peaceful students had nobody to offend them. The solution was a kind of formal insult that did not actually infringe honour, but was just seen as a challenge for fencing. The standard wording was (German for &quot;stupid boy.&quot;)

In the long term, this solution was unsatisfying. Around 1850, the (German means &quot;ascertain&quot;, &quot;define&quot; or &quot;determine&quot;) was developed and introduced throughout Germany. This meant the opponents of a were determined by the fencing official of their corporations. These officials were regularly vice-chairmen () and responsible for arranging bouts in cooperation with their colleagues from other corporations. Their objective was to find opponents of equal physical and fencing capabilities to make the event challenging for both participants. That is the way it is still done today and is the concept of the in the modern sense of the word.

Before the Communist revolution in Russia and before World War II, academic fencing was known in most countries of Eastern Europe, as well.

==Modern mensur==
By the end of the 19th century, the dueling form evolved into the modern Mensur. In 1884, the British &quot;Saturday Review&quot; described the dueling as follows:

During the times of the Third Reich, the national socialist leadership chose to forbid academic fencing. They had recognized that fencing was an integral part of the internal strength of the last still-existing independent fraternities during the later 1930s. As Nazi pressure increased and fraternities were forced to officially suspend their activities, so-called comradeships were founded. These provided means for practicing and organising the among former fraternities while remaining undetected to the Nazi secret police. One such example was the SC-Comradeship &quot;Hermann Löns&quot; initiated by members of the Corps Hubertia Freiburg and other fraternities in Freiburg, Germany. There, fencing Mensur &quot;duels&quot; continued and even intensified from 1941 on, with over 100 of such duels happening during World War II in Freiburg alone. Following the war, most of the formerly suspended fraternities were reactivated and resumed the traditions of Mensur fencing if they had not continued throughout the time of Nazi occupation.

Today, the Mensur is practiced by about 400 traditional fraternities in Germany, several of the , , , , and . , as the is known in Poland, is still practiced, although its popularity has declined since the end of World War II. It is also still known in a few other European countries, though there, protective equipment use is extensive and dueling scars are almost unheard of.

==In popular culture==

=== Literature ===

American traveller Mark Twain devoted several chapters of &quot;A Tramp Abroad&quot; (1880) to Heidelberg students&#x27; fencing.

In &quot;Three Men on the Bummel&quot; (1900), Jerome K. Jerome devoted a chapter to German student life, and describes the &quot;German &quot; in detail. While much of the book has a tone of admiration for the German people, he expressed extreme disapproval for this tradition.

In George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s &quot;Royal Flash&quot; (1970), the protagonist Harry Flashman is scarred with a as part of his disguise as a Danish prince.

 is featured in Heinrich Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;Man of Straw&quot; ().

 scars are repeatedly noted and described as a sign of beauty and manliness by German characters in Katherine Anne Porter&#x27;s novel &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;.

 scars are mentioned in passing in Robert Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; when two German recruits are asked at the beginning of boot camp where they got their scars. The drill sergeant even uses the term (as spelled in modern German). E. C. Gordon, the hero of Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Glory Road&quot;, mentions his desire for a degree from Heidelberg and the dueling scars to go with it.

In the James Bond books by Ian Fleming, the supervillain Ernst Stavro Blofeld has a dueling scar below his eye.

=== Film ===
The is featured in a number of German films, notably:
* (&quot;Hans Westmar – One of Many&quot;), 1933
*, 1951

and less commonly in films outside Germany, such as
*&quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot;, 1943

=== Television ===
* In episode 77 of Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;, &quot;The Vorpal Blade&quot;, the story revolves around duelling of this kind
* In &quot;Freud&quot;, dueling is shown and many characters have scars from dueling.

<doc id="337453" wikidata="Q1759920" url="?curid=337453" title="Retrograde ejaculation">
<text>Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen which would be ejaculated via the urethra is redirected to the urinary bladder. Normally, the sphincter of the bladder contracts before ejaculation, inhibiting urination and preventing a reflux of semen into the bladder. The semen is forced to exit via the urethra, the path of least resistance. When the bladder sphincter does not function properly, retrograde ejaculation may occur. It can also be induced deliberately by a male as a primitive form of male birth control (known as &quot;coitus saxonicus&quot;) or as part of certain alternative medicine practices. The retrograde-ejaculated semen is excreted from the bladder during the next urination.

==Signs and symptoms==
Retrograde ejaculation is sometimes referred to as a &quot;dry orgasm.&quot; Retrograde ejaculation is one symptom of male infertility. A man may notice that no semen is produced during masturbation despite the occurrence of orgasm. Another underlying cause for this phenomenon may be ejaculatory duct obstruction.

During a male orgasm, sperm are released from the epididymides and travel via small tubes called the vasa deferentia. The sperm mix with seminal fluid in the seminal vesicles, prostate fluid from the prostate gland, and lubricants from the bulbourethral gland. During climax, muscles at the end of the bladder neck tighten to prevent retrograde flow of semen. In retrograde ejaculation, these bladder neck muscles are either very weak or the nerves controlling the muscles have been damaged.

==Causes==
A malfunctioning bladder sphincter, leading to retrograde ejaculation, may be a result either of:
* Autonomic nervous system dysfunction. (Dysautonomia)
* Operation on the prostate. It is a common complication of transurethral resection of the prostate, a procedure in which prostate tissue is removed, slice by slice, through a resectoscope passed along the urethra.
It can also be caused by a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for testicular cancer if nerve pathways to the bladder sphincter are damaged, with the resulting retrograde ejaculation being either temporary or permanent. Modern nerve-sparing techniques seek to reduce this risk; however, it may also occur as the result of Green Light Laser prostate surgery. 
Surgery on the bladder neck accounted for about ten percent of the cases of retrograde ejaculation or anejaculation reported in a literature review.

Retrograde ejaculation is a common side effect of medications, such as tamsulosin, that are used to relax the muscles of the urinary tract, treating conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. By relaxing the bladder sphincter muscle, the likelihood of retrograde ejaculation is increased.

The medications that mostly cause it are antidepressant and antipsychotic medication, as well as NRIs such as atomoxetine; patients experiencing this phenomenon tend to quit the medications.

Retrograde ejaculation can also be a complication of diabetes, especially in cases of diabetics with long term poor blood sugar control. This is due to neuropathy of the bladder sphincter. Post-pubertal males (aged 17 to 20 years) who experience repeated episodes of retrograde ejaculation are often diagnosed with urethral stricture disease shortly after the initial complaint arises. It is currently not known whether a congenital malformation of the bulbous urethra is responsible, or if pressure applied to the base of the penis or perineum immediately preceding ejaculatory inevitability may have inadvertently damaged the urethra. This damage is most often seen within 0.5 cm of the ejaculatory duct (usually distal to the duct).

===Conditions which can affect bladder neck muscle===
Medications to treat high blood pressure, benign prostate hyperplasia, mood disorders, surgery on the prostate and nerve injury (which may occur in multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or diabetes).

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is usually determined after a medical professional performs a urinalysis on a urine specimen that is obtained shortly after ejaculation. In cases of retrograde ejaculation, the specimen will contain an abnormal level of sperm. Especially in case of &quot;orgasmic anejaculation&quot;, anejaculation can often be confused with retrograde ejaculation, and they share some fundamental aspects of the cause. Urinalysis is used to distinguish between them.

===Tests===
The genitals are physically examined to ensure that there are no anatomical problems. The urine will be tested for the presence of semen. If there are no sperm in the urine, it may be due to damage to the prostate as a result of surgery or prior radiation therapy.

== Treatments ==
The treatment depends on the cause. Medications may work for retrograde ejaculation but only in a few cases. Surgery rarely is the first option for retrograde ejaculation and the results have proven to be inconsistent. Medications do not help retrograde ejaculation if there has been permanent damage to the prostate or the testes from radiation. Medications also do not help if prostate surgery has resulted in damage to the muscles or nerves. Medications only work if there has been mild nerve damage caused by diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or mild spinal cord injury.

===Medications===
* Tricyclic antidepressants like imipramine.
* Antihistamines like chlorphenamine.
* Decongestants like ephedrine and phenylephrine.

These medications tighten the bladder neck muscles and prevent semen from going backwards into the bladder. However, the medications do have many side effects and they have to be taken at least 1–2 hours prior to sexual intercourse. In many cases, the medications fail to work at the right time because most men are not able to predict when they will have an orgasm.

=== Infertility treatments ===
If a couple is experiencing infertility as a result of retrograde ejaculation and medications are not helping, the collection of the semen collection may undergo a special procedure. First, the patient alkalinizes his urine by intake of sodium bicarbonate (3g dissolved in water in the evening before bed, and then another dose after complete bladder emptying right before going to the laboratory). Before semen collection the patient must empty his bladder. The patient then has to masturbate in one container and immediately after has to urinate in another container. The male&#x27;s ejaculate may be centrifuged from urine voided, and the isolated sperm injected directly into the woman through the use of intrauterine insemination. In more severe cases, in-vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection may be used.

==Intentional induction==
Retrograde ejaculation can be deliberately induced by squeezing the urethra at the base or applying pressure to the perineum during orgasm. The retrograde-ejaculated sperm goes into the bladder and is excreted with the next urination.

===Contraception===
In certain cultures, such as in the Oneida Community, retrograde ejaculation is performed as a form of primitive male birth control (&quot;coitus saxonicus&quot;). However, the practice is not considered a reliable method compared to most modern types of birth control. Besides the lack of protection from STDs, the technique itself can be hard to execute correctly during the act of coitus, especially if the male does not fully understand the anatomy involved. Many doctors also do not recommend &quot;coitus saxonicus&quot; due to the risk of putting pressure on the pudendal nerve, which can cause numbness in the penis.

===Taoism===

Taoists and some fields of alternative medicine recommend and teach deliberate retrograde ejaculation as a way of &quot;conserving the body&#x27;s energy&quot;. It was believed that retrograde ejaculation caused the sperm to travel into the head and nourish the brain, or that energy is conserved physically by keeping the sperm (and thereby, the &quot;intelligence&quot; that created it) in the body. However, there are other Taoist perspectives on the general subject of ejaculation and techniques that do not involve retrograde ejaculation (see Taoist sexual practices).

<text>Shabbir Banoobhai (born 23 October 1949) is a South African poet.

==Biography==

He was born in Durban and, after school wanted to study at University. The costs were prohibitive, and instead he studied to become a teacher at Springfield College. He was elected President of the Student&#x27;s Representative Council in 1970, and became assistant editor of the college newspaper, &quot;Aspect&quot;, which was occasionally banned for its protests against the apartheid state.

At college, he met Fatima Meer, who, after finding out he wrote poetry, suggested he meet with the prominent poet Douglas Livingstone.

While still at college, he successfully studied for a Bachelor of Commerce Degree through Unisa, the correspondence university, and after a short stint of teaching, he began work as an accountant.

In his own words, his work aims &quot;to promote a vision of a more humane society – a society that not only respects all its members as human beings but which considers them as spiritual beings and essentially divine&quot;.

<text>Riesa-Großenhain was a district in Saxony, Germany. It was bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of 
Elbe-Elster and Oberspreewald-Lausitz in Brandenburg, Kamenz, Meißen, Döbeln and Torgau-Oschatz.

== History ==
The district was created in 1994 by merging the two previous districts Riesa and Großenhain. In August 2008, it was incorporated into the district of Meißen.

== Geography ==
The district is situated in the plain countryside north of the virtual line connecting Leipzig and Dresden. The main river is the Elbe which runs through the district from south to northwest.

<doc id="337457" wikidata="Q441185" url="?curid=337457" title="Raoul Bott">
<text>Raoul Bott (September 24, 1923 – December 20, 2005) was a Hungarian-American mathematician known for numerous foundational contributions to geometry in its broad sense. He is best known for his Bott periodicity theorem, the Morse–Bott functions which he used in this context, and the Borel–Bott–Weil theorem.

==Early life==
Bott was born in Budapest, Hungary, the son of Margit Kovács and Rudolph Bott. His father was of Austrian descent, and his mother was of Hungarian Jewish descent; Bott was raised a Catholic by his mother and stepfather in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, now the capital of Slovakia. Bott grew up in Czechoslovakia and spent his working life in the United States. His family emigrated to Canada in 1938, and subsequently he served in the Canadian Army in Europe during World War II.

==Career==
Bott later went to college at McGill University in Montreal, where he studied electrical engineering. He then earned a PhD in mathematics from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh in 1949. His thesis, titled &quot;Electrical Network Theory&quot;, was written under the direction of Richard Duffin. Afterward, he began teaching at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Bott continued his study at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was a professor at Harvard University from 1959 to 1999. In 2005 Bott died of cancer in San Diego.

With Richard Duffin at Carnegie Mellon, Bott studied existence of electronic filters corresponding to given positive-real functions. In 1949 they proved a fundamental theorem of filter synthesis. Duffin and Bott extended earlier work by Otto Brune that requisite functions of complex frequency &quot;s&quot; could be realized by a passive network of inductors and capacitors. The proof relied on induction on the sum of the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and denominator of the rational function.
In his 2000 interview with Allyn Jackson of the American Mathematical Society, he explained that he sees &quot;networks as discrete versions of harmonic theory&quot;, so his experience with network synthesis and electronic filter topology introduced him to algebraic topology.

Bott met Arnold S. Shapiro at the IAS and they worked together.
He studied the homotopy theory of Lie groups, using methods from Morse theory, leading to the Bott periodicity theorem (1957). In the course of this work, he introduced Morse–Bott functions, an important generalization of Morse functions.

This led to his role as collaborator over many years with Michael Atiyah, initially via the part played by periodicity in K-theory. Bott made important contributions towards the index theorem, especially in formulating related fixed-point theorems, in particular the so-called &#x27;Woods Hole fixed-point theorem&#x27;, a combination of the Riemann–Roch theorem and Lefschetz fixed-point theorem (it is named after Woods Hole, Massachusetts, the site of a conference at which collective discussion formulated it). The major Atiyah–Bott papers on what is now the Atiyah–Bott fixed-point theorem were written in the years up to 1968; they collaborated further in recovering in contemporary language Ivan Petrovsky on Petrovsky lacunas of hyperbolic partial differential equations, prompted by Lars Gårding. In the 1980s, Atiyah and Bott investigated gauge theory, using the Yang–Mills equations on a Riemann surface to obtain topological information about the moduli spaces of stable bundles on Riemann surfaces. In 1983 he spoke to the Canadian Mathematical Society in a talk he called &quot;A topologist marvels at Physics&quot;.

He is also well known in connection with the Borel–Bott–Weil theorem on representation theory of Lie groups via holomorphic sheaves and their cohomology groups; and for work on foliations. With Chern he worked on Nevanlinna theory, studied holomorphic vector bundles over complex analytic manifolds and introduced the Bott-Chern classes, useful in the theory of Arakelov geometry and also to algebraic number theory.

He introduced Bott–Samelson varieties and the Bott residue formula for complex manifolds and the Bott cannibalistic class.

==Awards==
In 1964, he was awarded the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry by the American Mathematical Society. In 1983, he was awarded the Jeffery–Williams Prize by the Canadian Mathematical Society. In 1987, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.

In 2000, he received the Wolf Prize. In 2005, he was elected an Overseas Fellow of the Royal Society of London.

==Students==
Bott had 35 PhD students, including Stephen Smale, Lawrence Conlon, Daniel Quillen, Peter Landweber, Robert MacPherson, Robert W. Brooks, Robin Forman, Rama Kocherlakota, Susan Tolman, András Szenes, Kevin Corlette, and Eric Weinstein. Smale and Quillen won Fields Medals in 1966 and 1978 respectively.

<text>Douglas Livingstone (5 January 1932 – 19 February 1996) was a South African poet.

He was born in Kuala Lumpur, but his family moved to Natal after his father was taken prisoner during the Japanese invasion of Malaya. He attended Kearsney College and in 1964, he started work as a marine biologist in Durban. He gained two doctorates from the University of Natal; one for his scientific work and an honorary one for his poetry.

This fire, known as the Peshtigo fire, was the deadliest in American history. Unidentifiable remains of hundreds of residents were buried in a mass grave at the Peshtigo Fire Cemetery.

<text>Walter Jurmann (October 12, 1903 – June 17, 1971) was an Austrian-born composer of popular music renowned for his versatility who, after immigrating to the United States, specialized in film scores and soundtracks.

==Biography==
Born in Vienna, Jurmann received a classical education, taking his &quot;Matura&quot; exams in 1921. For some time he studied medicine but in 1924, after working as a lounge pianist in a posh hotel in the Semmering area of Lower Austria, abandoned his studies altogether in order to pursue a career in music. He moved to Berlin and soon became successful with tunes such as &quot;Du bist nicht die Erste&quot;. Probably his most famous 1920s song is &quot;Veronika, der Lenz ist da&quot;, popularized by the all-male a cappella ensemble, the Comedian Harmonists. With the arrival of sound movies Jurmann also began writing film music, starting with &quot;Ihre Majestät, die Liebe&quot; (&quot;Her Majesty, Love&quot;) (1930). Jurman&#x27;s melodies were so charming and easy to remember that a contemporary paper reported that cinemagoers were humming the new tunes already on the morning following the release of a new film.

In 1933, after the Nazis had come to power, Jurmann left Berlin for Paris, France, where he continued writing songs, occasionally incorporating elements of the French &quot;chanson&quot;. In 1934 he met Louis B. Mayer, who offered him a seven-year contract with MGM. Subsequently, Jurmann and his partner, Polish-born composer Bronisław Kaper (1902 - 1983), went to Hollywood. Jurmann&#x27;s successful films include &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1935) (&quot;Love Song of Tahiti&quot;), the 1936 movie &quot;San Francisco&quot; (&quot;Theme from San Francisco&quot;), the Marx Brothers films &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (&quot;Cosi Cosa,&quot; 1935) and &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (&quot;All God&#x27;s Chillun Got Rhythm,&quot; 1937), and &quot;Presenting Lily Mars&quot; (1943) starring Judy Garland.

In the early 1940s Jurmann, who had settled down in Los Angeles, withdrew from the film business although he continued writing &quot;Ohrwürmer&quot; up to his death. In 1953 he married Yvonne Jellinek, a Hungarian fashion designer whom he had met at a party in the U.S. In 1971, during a trip to Europe, he died unexpectedly of a heart attack in Budapest, his wife&#x27;s home town. He is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California.

<text>Berthold Bartosch (29 December 1893 – 13 November 1968) was a film-maker, born in Polaun, in the Bohemia region of Austria-Hungary (now part of the Czech Republic).

==Work with Lotte Reiniger==
He moved to Berlin in 1920 and collaborated with Lotte Reiniger on her paper silhouette animations:
*&quot;The Ornament of the Loving Heart&quot;
*&quot;The Battle of Skagerrak&quot;
*&quot;The Adventures of Prince Achmed&quot;
*&quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;

Bartosch created what some consider the first multiplane camera in order to achieve some of the effects for these films.

==Early career==
In 1911, Berthold Bartosch studied architecture in Vienna, where he met Erwin Hanslick, a teacher at the Fine Art School that was a crucial influence for Bartosch. Hanslick proposed Bartosch collaborate in educational animated films &quot;for the masses&quot;, and Bartosch accepted. They created geographical and politically oriented films, which were the only apprenticeship that Bartosch received.

In 1919, Bartosch opened a branch of Hanslick&#x27;s production company in Berlin, where he met other artists including Berthold Brecht and Jean Renoir. At that time, he collaborated with Lotte Reiniger on &quot;Prince Achmed&quot;.

==Work in Paris==
In 1930 Bartosch moved to Paris and created the 30 minute film entitled &#x27;L&#x27;Idée&#x27; (&quot;The Idea&quot;) for which he is most remembered. The film is described as the first serious, poetic, tragic work in animation. The film&#x27;s characters and backdrops were composed of several layers of different types of paper from semi-transparent to thick cardboard. Special effects like , smoke and fog were made with lather spread on glass plates and lit from behind. Bartosch based the film on a wordless novel of woodcuts by Frans Masereel, &quot;The Idea&quot; (1920).

&quot;L&#x27;idee&quot;, when released in 1933, featured a score by composer Arthur Honegger, including an ondes Martenot, which is believed to be the very first use of an electronic musical instrument in film history. The following year, Franz Waxman&#x27;s score for &quot;Liliom&quot; (1934) used a theremin.

From 1933 to 1938, Bartosch worked on an anti-war film, &quot;St. Francis&quot; or &quot;Nightmare and Dreams&quot;, a 25-minute piece being financed by Thorold Dickinson. When the Nazis invaded Paris, he deposited the film at the Cinémathèque Française. The film was destroyed during the Nazi occupation, and only a few still images exist.

In 1948, he spent a year working for UNESCO in Paris mentoring George Dunning, a Canadian-born animator known for his involvement with the Beatles&#x27;s animated feature, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; (1968).

<doc id="337489" wikidata="Q1255650" url="?curid=337489" title="Karpman drama triangle">
<text>The Karpman drama triangle is a social model of human interaction proposed by San Francisco psychiatrist, Stephen B. Karpman in 1968. The triangle maps a type of destructive interaction that can occur among people in conflict. The drama triangle model is a tool used in psychotherapy, specifically transactional analysis. The triangle of actors in the drama are persecutors, victims, and rescuers.

Karpman described how in some cases these roles were not undertaken in an honest manner to resolve the presenting problem, but rather were used fluidly and switched between by the actors in a way that achieved unconscious goals and agendas. The outcome in such cases was that the actors would be left feeling justified and entrenched, but there would often be little or no change to the presenting problem, and other more fundamental problems giving rise to the situation remaining unaddressed.

==Use==
Through popular usage, and the work of Stephen Karpman and others, Karpman&#x27;s triangle has been adapted for use in structural analysis and transactional analysis.

==Theory==
Karpman used triangles to map conflicted or drama-intense relationship transactions. The Karpman Drama Triangle models the connection between personal responsibility and power in conflicts, and the destructive and shifting roles people play. He defined three roles in the conflict; Persecutor, Rescuer (the one up positions) and Victim (one down position). Karpman placed these three roles on an inverted triangle and referred to them as being the three aspects, or faces of drama.

# The Victim: The Victim in this model is not intended to represent an actual victim, but rather someone feeling or acting like one. The Victim seeks to convince him or herself and others that he or she cannot do anything, nothing can be done, all attempts are futile, &quot;despite trying hard&quot;. One payoff for this stance is avoiding real change or acknowledgement of one&#x27;s true feelings, which may bring anxiety and risk, while feeling one is doing all one can to escape it. As such, the Victim&#x27;s stance is &quot;Poor me!&quot; The Victim feels persecuted, oppressed, helpless, hopeless, powerless, ashamed, and seems unable to make decisions, solve problems, take pleasure in life or achieve insight. The Victim will remain with a Persecutor or, if not being persecuted, will set someone else up in the role of Persecutor. The Victim will also seek help, creating one or more Rescuers to save the day, who will in reality perpetuate the Victim&#x27;s negative feelings and leave the situation broadly unchanged.
# The Rescuer: The Rescuer&#x27;s line is &quot;Let me help you.&quot; A classic enabler, the Rescuer feels guilty if they do not go to the rescue, and ultimately becomes angry (and becomes a Persecutor) as their help fails to achieve change. Yet the Rescuer&#x27;s rescuing has negative effects: it keeps the Victim dependent and doesn&#x27;t allow the Victim permission to fail and experience the consequences of his or her choices. The rewards derived from this rescue role are that the focus is taken away from the Rescuer, who can also feel good for having tried, and justified in their negative feelings (to the other actor/s) upon failing. When one focuses one&#x27;s energy on another, it enables one to ignore one&#x27;s own anxiety and troubles. This rescue role is also pivotal because one&#x27;s actual primary interest is really an avoidance of one&#x27;s own problems disguised as concern for the Victim&#x27;s needs.
# The Persecutor: (a.k.a. Villain) The Persecutor insists, &quot;It&#x27;s all your fault.&quot; The Persecutor is controlling, blaming, critical, oppressive, angry, authoritarian, rigid and superior. But if blamed in turn, the Persecutor may become defensive and may switch roles to become a Victim if attacked forcefully by the Rescuer and/or Victim, in which case the Victim may also switch roles to become a Persecutor.

Initially a drama triangle arises when a person takes on the role of a victim or persecutor. This person then feels the need to enlist other players into the conflict. As often happens, a rescuer is encouraged to enter the situation. These enlisted players take on roles of their own that are not static, and therefore various scenarios can occur. The victim might turn on the rescuer, for example, while the rescuer then switches to persecution.

The reason that the situation persists is that each participant has their (frequently unconscious) psychological wishes/needs met without having to acknowledge the broader dysfunction or harm done in the situation as a whole. Each participant is acting upon his or her own selfish needs, rather than acting in a genuinely responsible or altruistic manner. Any character might &quot;ordinarily come on like a plaintive victim; it is now clear that the one can switch into the role of Persecutor providing it is &#x27;accidental&#x27; and the one apologizes for it&quot;.

The motivations of the rescuer are the least obvious. In the terms of the triangle, the rescuer has a mixed or covert motive and benefits in some way from being &quot;the one who rescues&quot;. The rescuer has a surface motive of resolving the problem and appears to make great efforts to solve it, but also has a hidden motive to not succeed, or to succeed in a way in which he or she benefits. The rescuer may get a self-esteem boost, for example, or receive respected rescue status, or derive enjoyment by having someone depend on or trust him or her and act in a way that ostensibly seems to be trying to help, but at a deeper level plays upon the victim in order to continue getting a payoff.

The relationship between the victim and the rescuer may be one of codependency. The rescuer keeps the victim dependent by encouraging his or her victimhood. The victim gets his or her needs met by being taken care of by the rescuer.

Participants generally tend to have a primary or habitual role (victim, rescuer, persecutor) when they enter into drama triangles. Participants first learn their habitual roles in their respective families of origin. Even though participants each have a role with which they most identify, once on the triangle, participants rotate through all the three positions.

Each triangle has a &quot;payoff&quot; for those playing it. The &quot;antithesis&quot; of a drama triangle lies in discovering how to deprive the actors of their payoff.

==Historical context==
===Family therapy movement===
After World War II, therapists observed that while many battle-torn veteran patients readjusted well after returning to their families, some patients did not; some even regressed when they returned to their home environment. Researchers felt that they needed an explanation for this and began to explore the dynamics of family life – and thus began the family therapy movement. Prior to this time, psychiatrists and psychoanalysts focused on the patient&#x27;s already-developed psyche and downplayed outside detractors. Intrinsic factors were addressed and extrinsic reactions were considered as emanating from forces within the person.

===Transactions analysis===
In the 1950s, Eric Berne developed transactional analysis, a method for studying interactions between individuals. This approach was profoundly different from that of Freud. While Freud relied on asking patients about themselves, Berne felt that a therapist could learn by observing what was communicated (words, body language, facial expressions) in a transaction. So instead of directly asking the patient questions, Berne would frequently observe the patient in a group setting, noting all of the transactions that occurred between the patient and other individuals.

===Triangles/triangulation===
The theory of triangulation was originally published in 1966 by Murray Bowen as one of eight parts of Bowen&#x27;s family systems theory. Murray Bowen, a pioneer in family systems theory, began his early work with schizophrenics at the Menninger Clinic, from 1946 to 1954. Triangulation is the “process whereby a two-party relationship that is experiencing tension will naturally involve third parties to reduce tension”. Simply put, when people find themselves in conflict with another person, they will reach out to a third person. The resulting triangle is more comfortable, as it can hold much more tension, because the tension is being shifted around three people instead of two.

Bowen studied the dyad of the &quot;mother and her schizophrenic child&quot; while he had them both living in a research unit at the Menninger clinic. Bowen then moved to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), where he resided from 1954 to 1959. At the NIMH Bowen extended his hypothesis to include the &quot;father-mother-child&quot; triad. Bowen considered &quot;differentiation&quot; and &quot;triangles&quot; the crux of his theory, Bowen Family Systems Theory. Bowen intentionally used the word &quot;triangle&quot; rather than &quot;triad&quot;. In Bowen Family Systems Theory, the triangle is an essential part of the relationship.

Couples left to their own resources oscillate between closeness and distance. Two people having this imbalance often have difficulty resolving it by themselves. To stabilize the relationship, the couple often seek the aid of a third party to help re-establish closeness. A triangle is the smallest possible relationship system that can restore balance in a time of stress. The third person assumes an outside position. In periods of stress, the outside position is the most comfortable and desired position. The inside position is plagued by anxiety, along with its emotional closeness. The outsider serves to preserve the inside couple&#x27;s relationship. Bowen noted that not all triangles are constructive – some are destructive.

===Pathological/perverse triangles===
In 1968, Nathan Ackerman conceptualized a destructive triangle. Ackerman stated &quot;we observe certain constellations of family interactions which we have epitomized as the pattern of family interdependence, roles those of destroyer or persecutor, the victim of the scapegoating attack, and the family healer or the family doctor.&quot; Ackerman also recognized the pattern of attack, defense, and counterattack, as shifting roles.

===Karpman triangle and Eric Berne===
In 1968, Stephen Karpman, who had an interest in acting and was a member of the Screen Actors Guild, chose &quot;drama triangle&quot; rather than &quot;conflict triangle&quot; as, here, the Victim in his model is not intended to represent an actual victim, but rather someone feeling or acting like one. He first published his theory in an article entitled &quot;Fairy Tales and Script Drama Analysis&quot;. His article, in part, examined the fairy tale &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; to illustrate its points. Karpman was, at the time, a recent graduate of Duke University School of Medicine and was doing post post-graduate studies under Berne. Berne, who founded the field of transactional analysis, encouraged Karpman to publish what Berne referred to as &quot;Karpman&#x27;s triangle&quot;. Karpman&#x27;s article was published in 1968. In 1972, Karpman received the Eric Berne Memorial Scientific Award for the work.

==Transactional analysis==
Eric Berne, a Canadian-born psychiatrist, created the theory of transactional analysis, in the middle of the 20th century, as a way of explaining human behavior. Berne&#x27;s theory of transactional analysis was based on the ideas of Freud but was distinctly different. Freudian psychotherapists focused on talk therapy as a way of gaining insight to their patients&#x27; personalities. Berne believed that insight could be better discovered by analyzing patients’ social transactions.

&quot;Games&quot; in transactional analysis refers to a series of transactions that is complementary (reciprocal), ulterior, and proceeds towards a predictable outcome. In this context, the Karpman Drama Triangle is a &quot;game&quot;.

Games are often characterized by a switch in roles of players towards the end. The number of players may vary. Games in this sense are devices used (often unconsciously) by people to create a circumstance where they can justifiably feel certain resulting feelings (such as anger or superiority) or justifiably take or avoid taking certain actions where their own inner wishes differ from societal expectations. They are always a substitute for a more genuine and full adult emotion and response which would be more appropriate. Three quantitative variables are often useful to consider for games:
: Flexibility: &quot;The ability of the players to change the currency of the game (that is, the tools they use to play it). &#x27;Some games...can be played properly with only one kind of currency, while others, such as exhibitionistic games, are more flexible&quot;, so that the focus of power may shift from words, to money, to parts of the body.
: Tenacity: &quot;Some people give up their games easily, others are more persistent&quot;, referring to the way people stick to their games and their resistance to breaking away from them.
: Intensity: &quot;Some people play their games in a relaxed way, others are more tense and aggressive. Games so played are known as easy and hard games, respectively&quot;.

The consequences of games may vary from small paybacks to paybacks built up over a long period to a major level. Based on the degree of acceptability and potential harm, games are classified into three categories, representing first degree games, second degree games, and third degree games:
* socially acceptable,
* undesirable but not irreversibly damaging 
* may result in drastic harm.

The Karpman triangle was an adaptation of a model that was originally conceived to analyze the play-action pass and the draw play in American football and later adapted as a way to analyze movie scripts. Karpman is reported to have doodled thirty or more diagram types before settling on the triangle. Karpman credits the movie &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; as being a testbed for refining the model into what Berne coined as the Karpman Drama Triangle.

Karpman now has many variables of the Karpman triangle in his fully developed theory, besides role switches. These include space switches (private-public, open-closed, near-far) which precede, cause, or follow role switches, and script velocity (number of role switches in a given unit of time). These include the &quot;Question Mark triangle, False Perception triangle, Double Bind triangle, The Indecision triangle, the Vicious Cycle triangle, Trapping triangle, Escape triangle, Triangles of Oppression, and Triangles of Liberation, Switching in the triangle,&quot; and &quot;the Alcoholic Family triangle.&quot;

While transactional analysis is the method for studying interactions between individuals, one researcher postulates that drama-based leaders can instill an organizational culture of drama. &quot;Persecutors&quot; are more likely to be in leadership positions and a &quot;persecutor culture&quot; goes hand in hand with cutthroat competition, fear, blaming, manipulation, high turnover and an increased risk of lawsuits. There are also &quot;victim cultures&quot; which can lead to low morale and low engagement as well as an avoidance of conflict, and &quot;rescuer cultures&quot; which can be characterized as having a high dependence on the leader, low initiative and low innovation.

==Therapeutic models==
The Winner&#x27;s Triangle was published by Acey Choy in 1990 as a therapeutic model for showing patients how to alter social transactions when entering a triangle at any of the three entry points. Choy recommends that anyone feeling like a victim think more in terms of being &quot;vulnerable and caring&quot;, that anyone cast as a persecutor adopt an &quot;assertive&quot; posture, and anyone recruited to be a rescuer should react by being &quot;caring&quot;.

* &quot;Vulnerable&quot; – a victim should be encouraged to accept their vulnerability, problem solve, and be more self-aware.
* &quot;Assertive&quot; – a persecutor should be encouraged to ask for what they want, be assertive, and cultivate self-compassion.
* &quot;Caring&quot; – a rescuer should be encouraged to show concern and be caring, but not over-reach and problem solve for others.

The Power of TED*, first published in 2009, recommends that the &quot;victim&quot; adopt the alternative role of &quot;creator&quot;, view the persecutor as a &quot;challenger&quot;, and enlist a &quot;coach&quot; instead of a rescuer.

* &quot;Creator&quot; – victims are encouraged to be outcome-oriented as opposed to problem-oriented and take responsibility for choosing their response to life challenges. They should focus on resolving &quot;dynamic tension&quot; (the difference between current reality and the envisioned goal or outcome) by taking incremental steps toward the outcomes they are trying to achieve.
* &quot;Challenger&quot; – a victim is encouraged to see a persecutor as a person (or situation) that forces the creator to clarify their needs, and focus on their learning and growth.
* &quot;Coach&quot; – a rescuer should be encouraged to ask questions that are intended to help the individual to make informed choices. The key difference between a rescuer and a coach is that the coach sees the creator as capable of making choices and of solving their own problems. A coach asks questions that enable the creator to see the possibilities for positive action, and to focus on what they do want instead of what they don&#x27;t want.

<doc id="337492" wikidata="Q4162115" url="?curid=337492" title="Murder of Jesse Dirkhising">
<text>Jesse William Dirkhising (May 24, 1986 – September 26, 1999), also known as Jesse Yates, was an American teenager from Prairie Grove, Arkansas. He was staying with two men (with his parents’ permission) who bound, drugged, tortured, and repeatedly raped him. He died from drugging and positional asphyxia during the ordeal.

Despite his being at their home with approval from his parents, the defense argued he was complicit in the sexual acts, and therefore the death was accidental. Considering how he was a minor and the men were adults, this was considered unlikely. Further details revealed in the court case depicted a gruesome death.

Dirkhising&#x27;s death received only regional media coverage until a &quot;Washington Times&quot; article ran a story nearly a month after his death, noting the lack of national coverage in contrast to that given to the 1998 death of Matthew Shepard. The Shepard murder was approaching its first anniversary and was getting renewed national attention, coupled with updates on pending hate crime legislation. Prompted by coverage in &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, the Dirkhising case gained notoriety as conservative commentators compared media coverage of the two cases and explored the issues of what was considered a hate crime. The added attention resulted in mainstream media also reporting the Dirkhising case in relation to the coverage of the Shepard case, with many attempting to explain why the two were handled differently by the media, and perhaps received differently by readers.

The media coverage of the Dirkhising case was repeatedly and consistently contrasted with that of the high-profile Shepard case, although the cases were dissimilar in several important details. While both victims died as the result of assaults by two men, Dirkhising was a minor and the victim of a sex crime, while the adult Shepard was ostensibly murdered as part of a hate crime. While both heterosexuality and homosexuality have been cited as issues in both cases, the circumstances were different and in contrast: Shepard was an openly gay man who was attacked by two heterosexual men, while Dirkhising was raped by two men who were described as lovers in a police affidavit.

== Background ==
Dirkhising was the son of Tina and Miles Yates Jr. from the small town of Prairie Grove, Arkansas. At the time of his death he was 13 and in seventh grade. Davis Carpenter, who was charged with his murder, was then 38, and lived about away in Rogers, a &quot;small but booming northwest Arkansas town.&quot; 22-year-old Joshua Macave Brown shared Carpenter&#x27;s apartment. Carpenter, who managed a beauty salon, was a friend of Dirkhising&#x27;s parents. Dirkhising had stayed with the two men at their apartment on weekends only to work at the salon to make money to rebuild his car for two months prior to his death. Brown had been sexually molesting Dirkhising for two months before his death; he claimed that the boy was a willing participant, even though Jesse was dating a girl so this is unlikely and something only the defense tried to use. Jesse&#x27;s family had been told that he was helping out at the salon.

== Death and investigation ==
On September 26, 1999, Dirkhising&#x27;s murder was discovered by police of Rogers, Arkansas, when they responded to a 911 call. They went to the home of Davis Carpenter, where Joshua Brown was also present. Police found that Dirkhising had been tied to a mattress and that his ankles, knees, and wrists had been bound with duct tape and belts. Dirkhising had been gagged with his own underwear, a bandana and duct tape. Brown told police they had given Dirkhising an enema of urine dosed with amitriptyline, an antidepressant and a sedative. Police determined that Dirkhising had been repeatedly raped over a period of several hours. It was later revealed that over a two-day period Dirkhising had been repeatedly raped and sodomized with various objects. After the men took a break to eat, Brown noticed Dirkhising was not breathing and alerted Carpenter, who attempted to resuscitate the boy, then called 911. Dirkhising later died in the hospital, his death hastened apparently as the result of positional asphyxia.

Police found in Carpenter&#x27;s home material of a pedophile nature, including instructions on how to sedate a child, and a diagram of how to tie up and position the boy, as well as other notes of fantasies of molesting children. It was speculated that one of the men planned the assault and the other carried it out. The Arkansas State Police recorded in their affidavit a statement by Brown that he had been molesting Dirkhising for at least two months prior to Dirkhising&#x27;s death. Brown called the molestation &#x27;&#x27; and claimed that Dirkhising was a willing participant. According to age of consent laws in Arkansas, Dirkhising was incapable of giving informed consent for sexual activity. 
Brown also later claimed he himself was &quot;under the influence of methamphetamine&quot; when talking with his arresting officers.

== Media coverage ==
Dirkhising&#x27;s case initially was reported regionally by &quot;news organizations in Arkansas and also covered by newspapers in Oklahoma and Tennessee,&quot; yet almost no national press. The Associated Press ran the story on its local wires but not nationally until a month later when the story was focused on the lack of coverage rather than the crime itself. A LexisNexis search revealed only a few dozen articles that appeared only after &quot;The Washington Times&quot; story on the lack of coverage on October 22, 1999, a month after Dirkhising&#x27;s death.

=== Accusations of liberal media bias ===
On October 22, 1999, approximately one month after his death, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; ran a story with the headline &quot;Media tune out torture death of Arkansas boy.&quot; The story contrasted the lack of coverage of the Dirkhising case with the treatment the murder of Matthew Shepard received. The story quoted Tim Graham, director of media studies at Media Research Center, a conservative media watchdog group that frequently criticizes liberal bias, as saying, &quot;Nobody wants to say anything negative about homosexuals. Nobody wants to be seen on the wrong side of that issue.&quot; Brent Bozell, media critic and director of the Media Research Center, accused the media of deliberately spiking the story. Bozell wrote, &quot;Had he been openly gay and his attackers heterosexual, the crime would have led all the networks. But no liberal media outlet has as its villains two gay men.&quot;

After &quot;The Washington Times&quot; article, the lack of coverage of Dirkhising&#x27;s case was noted by conservative commentators and was attributed to the homosexuality of the perpetrators as well as the nature of the crimes. Conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan noted that showing gay men as sadistic barbarians does not fit the &quot;villain-victim script of our cultural elite.&quot;

The Dirkhising case was repeatedly compared with the media coverage of the murder of Matthew Shepard although Dirkhising was a minor in a sex crime and Shepard&#x27;s murder was a hate crime involving adults. Also the sexualities of the victims and attackers differed somewhat with Shepard being an openly gay man attacked by two heterosexual men, while Dirkhising&#x27;s attackers were lovers and presumed to be gay.

Jonathan Gregg wrote in &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Matthew Shepard died not because of an all-too-common sex crime, but because of prejudice. Essentially, Shepard was lynched; taken from a bar, beaten and left to die because he was the vilified &quot;other&quot; whom society has often cast as an acceptable target of abuse; Dirkhising was just &quot;another&quot; to a pair of deviants. And while child abuse is unfortunately no big news, lynching still is.&quot;

In the month after Shepard&#x27;s murder, LexisNexis recorded 3,007 stories about his death compared with only 46 in the month after the Dirkhising murder. However, once the media seized on the story, this count rapidly rose into the thousands. Many of the articles justified the lack of coverage, citing that the death did not justify national attention; initial reports failed to mention that the two perpetrators were gay, whereas the Shepard reports identified Shepard as gay and the crimes as hate crimes from the beginning. In a November 4, 1999, &quot;Time&quot; magazine article, Jonathan Gregg opined that accusations of liberal media bias were not justified because the two cases varied with the Dirkhising murder offering &quot;no lessons,&quot; whereas the Shepard murder &quot;touches on a host of complex and timely issues: intolerance, society&#x27;s attitudes toward gays and the pressure to conform, the use of violence as a means of confronting one&#x27;s demons.&quot;

=== Accusations of homophobia ===
Commentator Andrew Sullivan wrote an article in &quot;The New Republic&quot; accusing the liberal media of political correctness and using Dirkhising&#x27;s death to attack the Human Rights Campaign for its support of hate-crime legislation. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), however, complained that &quot;The Washington Times&quot; &quot;omitted a key piece of information&quot; for its front-page story on Dirkhising: The HRC had provided a statement strongly condemning the crime and called for the perpetrators to be punished &quot;to the fullest extent of the law.&quot; Sullivan also criticized some aspects of the conservative coverage of the Dirkhising case equating gay sex with child molestation as &quot;ugly nonsense&quot;. Sullivan squarely summed up the differences in media coverage as being due to political interests. Sullivan stated that whereas the Shepherd case was used to support including LGBTQ people in federal hate-crime law the Dirkhising case was ignored for concerns of inciting anti-gay prejudice. In November 1999, E. R. Shipp, ombudsman at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, noted that &quot;readers, prodded by commentators who are hostile to LGBTQ people and to what they view as a &#x27;liberal&#x27; press&quot; had raised questions about the Dirkhising case. Shipp said, however, that she &quot;made a clear distinction&quot; between the Dirkhising and Shepard cases: &quot;Matthew Shepard&#x27;s death sparked public expressions of outrage that themselves became news. . . . That Jesse Dirkhising&#x27;s death has not done so is hardly the fault of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.&quot; Shipp also noted that the Shepherd story was newsworthy because of the debate it fostered on hate crimes and the level of intolerance towards LGBT people in the United States.

The story of the September 26 death was transmitted by Associated Press national news wires on October 29, and the &quot;Post&quot; ran a news brief the following day.

Jonathan Gregg, in a November 9 &quot;Time&quot; magazine editorial, asserted that &quot;[the killing of Dirkhising] was the kind of depraved act that happens with even more regularity against young females and, indeed if the victim had been a 13-year-old girl, the story would probably never have gotten beyond Benton County, much less Arkansas. The same editorial also said: &quot;A red herring worth addressing at the outset is the failure to distinguish between homosexuality and pedophilia, which creates a false parallel at the core of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; argument. But sex with children is a crime regardless of the sexes involved, and is not synonymous with homosexuality. . . . &quot;The reason the Dirkhising story received so little play is [that] it offered no lessons. Shepard&#x27;s murder touches on a host of complex and timely issues: intolerance, society&#x27;s attitudes toward gays and the pressure to conform, the use of violence as a means of confronting one&#x27;s demons. &quot;Jesse Dirkhising&#x27;s death gives us nothing except the depravity of two sick men.&quot;

== Trials and convictions ==
Davis Don Carpenter and Joshua Brown were each charged with capital murder and six counts of rape, and they faced the death penalty in Arkansas for the crimes. Neither man had any known prior convictions. The two men were tried separately, as it was believed &quot;each of them will blame the other for the murder.&quot; The Arkansas state prosecutor &quot;maintained that the older man had mapped out the assault and watched a portion of it&quot; so chose to send Brown to trial first. Carpenter&#x27;s court-appointed attorney, criminal defense lawyer Tim Buckley, sought a change of venue from Benton County citing excessive pretrial publicity. &quot;It&#x27;s been on everyone&#x27;s lips down here for a month and a half,&quot; Buckley stated. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was &quot;almost alone among national newspapers&quot; reporting on Brown&#x27;s trial and Fox News was the only network to cover the murder trial and conviction. The prosecutors &quot;argued that Jesse suffocated to death during the sexual assault because of a combination of the drugs and the way he was trussed up.&quot; In March 2001, Brown was found guilty of first-degree murder and rape. He was sentenced to life in prison, and this sentence was upheld on appeal by the Arkansas Supreme Court in September 2003. In April 2001, Carpenter pleaded guilty to similar charges and was also sentenced to life. Subsequently, Carpenter said on the Fox News Channel that Brown was solely responsible for the rape and murder of Dirkhising while Brown said that Carpenter was the director.

 Carpenter, Arkansas Department of Corrections (ADC)#120443 is in the Tucker Maximum Security Unit. He entered the state prison system on April 26, 2001. Joshua Macave Brown, ADC#120142, is located in the East Arkansas Regional Unit. He had been received into the state prison system on April 4, 2001.

<text>The SVD (СВД; ), GRAU index 6V1, is a semi-automatic designated marksman rifle/sniper rifle chambered in the 7.62×54mmR cartridge, developed in the Soviet Union.

==History==
The SVD was designed to serve in a squad support role to provide precise long-range engagement capabilities to ordinary troops following the Warsaw Pact adoption of the 7.62×39mm intermediate cartridge and assault rifles as standard infantry weapon systems. At the time, NATO used battle rifles chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO fully powered cartridge as standard infantry weapon systems and had not yet adopted an intermediate cartridge and assault rifle of their own, allowing them to outrange their Warsaw Pact counterparts.

The SVD was developed through 1958–1963 and selected as the winner of a contest that included three competing groups of designers, led by Sergei Simonov (prototype rejected in April 1960), Aleksandr Konstantinov, and Yevgeny Dragunov. Extensive field testing of the rifles conducted in a wide range of environmental conditions (Konstantinov&#x27;s competing 2B-W-10 prototype was simpler and cheaper but tested less accurate, durable and reliable) resulted in Dragunov&#x27;s proposal chambered for the 7.62×54mmR fully powered cartridge being accepted into service in July 1963. An initial pre-production batch consisting of 200 rifles was assembled for evaluation purposes, and from 1964 serial production was carried out by Izhmash, later called Kalashnikov Concern.

Since then, the SVD has become the standard squad support weapon of several countries, including those of the former Warsaw Pact. China produced a copy of the SVD through reverse-engineered samples captured during the Sino-Vietnamese War as the Type 79 and 85. Iran also produced a clone, the Nakhjir 3, which was a direct copy of the Chinese Type 79.

In Russian service, the SVD is to be replaced with the Chukavin SVCh sniper/designated marksman rifle. In February 2023 it was reported that the Chukavin SVCh began to be mass-produced by Kalashnikov Concern. When chambered for the 7.62×54mmR the Chukavin SVCh uses SVD compatible box magazines.

In Ukrainian service, the SVD was largely replaced in the sniping role with Western sniper rifles chambered in .338 Lapua Magnum or 7.62×51mm NATO cartridges and anti-materiel rifles such as the Barrett M107A1. The domestically produced UAR-10 sniper rifle is also replacing the SVD in Ukrainian military and law enforcement units. According to McNab, the SVD remains in service with Ukrainian forces in the designated marksman rifle role.

==Design==
The SVD bears a number of cosmetic similarities to the AK family of rifles but these similarities are for the purpose of standardizing manual of arms. This has occasionally led to misidentification of the SVD as an AK variant, and vice versa.

=== Operating mechanism ===
The barrel breech is locked through a rotating bolt (left rotation) and uses three locking lugs to engage corresponding locking recesses in the barrel extension. The rifle has a hammer-type striking mechanism and a manual lever safety selector. In addition to the trigger disconnect, the fire control mechanism has a second disconnector which does not allow the hammer to fall until the bolt has been closed, similar to a sear in a select-fire weapon. However, the SVD was only designed for semi-automatic fire. The firing pin in the SVD is not retained, i.e. &quot;free-floating&quot;, and it is therefore possible for accidental discharge to occur as the bolt pushes an unfired cartridge into the chamber, should there be an obstruction in the firing pin channel resulting from poor maintenance or extreme cold.

The firearm is operated by a short-stroke gas piston system with a two-position gas regulator. The gas regulator can be set with the help of the rim of a cartridge. Position #1 leaves a gas escape port opened, whereas position #2 closes the gas escape port and directs extra gas to the piston, increasing the recoil velocity of the gas-piston system and is used for resolving reliability issues which arise from fouling in the gas port/action, extreme cold, high altitude, or using under-powered ammunition.

The rifle is fed from a detachable curved box magazine with a 10-round capacity and the cartridges are double-stacked in a staggered zigzag pattern. After discharging the last cartridge from the magazine, the bolt carrier and bolt are held back on a bolt catch that is released by pulling the cocking handle to the rear.

The rifle&#x27;s receiver is machined to improve precision by adding torsional strength.

=== Barrel ===
The barrel profile is relatively thin to save weight. Its bore is chrome-lined for increased corrosion resistance and features four right-hand grooves. Originally, the twist rate was 320 mm (1:12.6 in), as it had been designed for use with heavier civilian ammunition. In 1975 the twist rate was increased to the standard 240 mm (1:9.4 in), which reduced the precision with the 7N1 sniper cartridge by 19% but allowed for the use of standard &quot;light&quot; ball steel core LPS Gzh (57-N-323S), as well as its variations (incendiary, tracer, armour-piercing) with acceptable precision. The front part of the barrel features the front sight assembly and a bayonet lug. The muzzle is equipped with a permanently affixed long-slotted flash hider.

In order to pass inspections at the factory, these rifles must not produce more than a 0.7 MOA median deviation from the expected point of impact in three 10-shot groups using 7N1 (approximately 3 MOA).

=== Ammunition ===
To enable the desired precision of the SVD, new 7.62×54mmR &quot;sniper&quot; ammunition, designated 7N1, was designed by V. M. Sabelnikov, P. P. Sazonov and V. M. Dvorianinov in 1966 to meet the new standards. 7N1 sniper cartridges should not produce more than 1.24 MOA extreme vertical spread with 240 mm twist rate barrels and no more than 1.04 MOA extreme vertical spread with 320 mm twist rate barrels in a 5-shot group. The precision requirements demanded of the SVD with 7N1 is similar to the American M24 Sniper Weapon System with M118SB cartridges (1.18 MOA extreme vertical spread) and the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System with M118LR ammunition (1.27 MOA extreme vertical spread).

7N1 differed from the standard LPS Gzh (57-N-323S) cartridge in its use of finely extruded propellant and a modified projectile containing a void inside of the jacket at the tip which improved terminal ballistics and a bimetal lead and mild steel core. With standard 57-N-323S cartridges, the precision of the SVD is reduced to 2.21 MOA extreme vertical spread. This ammunition was later replaced by 7N14 in 1999, which replaced the mild steel penetrator with a hardened steel penetrator in response to the development of infantry body armour.

=== Sights ===
The rifle features adjustable iron sights with a sliding tangent rear sight, graduated from in increments. The iron sights can be used with or without the standard-issue optical sight in place. This is possible because the scope mount does not block the area between the front and rear sights.

The SVD was originally issued with a detachable PSO-1 optical sight (now PSO-1M2) which mounts to a Warsaw Pact rail on the left side of the receiver. 
The PSO-1 elevation turret features bullet drop compensation (BDC) in or increments for engaging point and area targets at ranges from up to . At longer distances the shooter must use the chevrons that would shift the trajectory by per each chevron. The BDC feature must be tuned at the factory for the particular ballistic trajectory of a particular combination of rifle and cartridge at a predefined air density. With increasing range, inevitable BDC-induced errors will occur when the environmental and meteorological circumstances deviate from the predefined circumstances for which the BDC was calibrated. Marksmen can be trained to understand the main forces acting on the projectile and their effect on their particular gun and ammunition, and the effects of external factors at longer ranges to counter these errors. The PSO-1 sight enables area targets to be engaged at ranges upwards of ; effective ranges in combat situations have been stated at between , depending on the nature of the target (point or area target) quality of ammunition and skill of the shooter.

Several military issue alternative telescopic sights with varying levels of magnification and reticles are available for the SVD. Rifles designated SVDN come equipped with a night sight, such as the NSP-3, NSPU, PGN-1, NSPUM or the Polish passive PCS-5. Rifles designated SVDN-1 can use the passive night sight NSPU-3 (1PN51) and rifles designated SVDN2 can use the passive night sight NSPUM (1PN58).

Commercial non military issue mounts that attach to the Warsaw Pact rail mount can allow use of Picatinny rail-mounted optics.

=== Stock ===
The original SVD had a birch plywood laminate two-piece handguard/gas tube cover and a skeletonized thumbhole stock equipped with a detachable cheek rest; the latter is removed when using iron sights. Beginning in the 80&#x27;s, wooden parts were replaced with synthetic parts made of a black polymer – the handguard and gas tube cover are more or less identical in appearance, while the thumbhole stock is of a different shape.

=== Accessories ===
A number of accessories are issued with the rifle, including a blade-type bayonet (AKM clipped point or the AK-74 spear point bayonet), four spare magazines, a leather or nylon sling, magazine pouch, cleaning kit and an accessory/maintenance kit for the telescopic sight. 

Also included is a cold weather battery case with a &quot;shirt clip&quot;, with a permanently attached cord [approximately 24&quot; long] ending with another battery case cap that has an extension to press against the internal contact in lieu of the battery to complete the circuit. Placing the external battery case into the shooters&#x27; clothing close to the body keeps it from freezing; using the clip ensures it remains in place. 

The clamp-style bipod attaches to machined-out reliefs near the front of the receiver, it literally grabs the two cut out areas and securely mounts with a large round sized head on the clamp bolt able to tightly attach the bipod. The legs are individually adjustable [as opposed to fixed length found on many rifles and LMGs] and can be folded and stowed in a forward position negating the need to remove the bipod before placing the rifle into the canvas carrying case. The two legs are held close together with a J-shaped clamp attached to one leg and swung over the other leg. Original Soviet/Russian SVD bipods fetch a very high price when they rarely appear on the market.

==Variants==


SVDN (6V1N) – A series of variants of the original SVD which were issued with various night vision optics.

SVDS (6V3) – Attempts to reduce the length of the rifle for use by marines, mechanised infantry, and paratroopers began in 1978 by adding a folding buttstock and a separate pistol grip. Initially, pre-existing stock designs were used (such as the one from the AKS-74), but ergonomic problems necessitated the design of a unique folding stock. The final design was chosen out of a variety of prototypes and adopted in 1995, which had a metal stock which folded to the right as to not be interfered by the optic mount and also had a shortened barrel. The stock included a rubber shoulder pad and cheek riser. The barrel was also given a heavier profile, the receiver housing was strengthened, the gas cylinder block was improved and a ported, and a shorter conical flash suppressor was adopted. The SVDSN (6V3N) variants, much like the SVDN variants, are simply equipped with various night vision devices.

SVD-1990 (SVD-90) – A variant of the SVD with the stock and handguard made from black polymers.

SVDM – A modernised variant of the SVDS which entered service in 2018. Compared to its predecessor, the SVDM was notably designed with a thicker (and 550 mm long) barrel, new furniture, and a picatinny rail mount on the new, hinged, dust cover. The variable power 1P88-4 (1П88-4) telescopic sight is used as the standard day optic. The SVDM rifle can be used with a detachable bipod, and with a quick-detachable suppressor. The iron sight line features a simplified rear sight element and a new front sight element located above the gas block. The SVDM has a length of ( with the stock folded) and weighs .

OTs-03 SVU – A variant of the TKB-0172 which began serial production in 1991 for the MVD. The rifle was also equipped with an improved muzzle brake as well as a rear aperture sight, much like the original SVD prototype. Many were not new production rifles, but instead, retrofitted SVDs. A select-fire variant (OTs-03A(S) SVU-A) was also produced in small quantities to serve as an automatic rifle, but the automatic fire capability was later removed from the design. The original shortened barrel was also later replaced with a full-length barrel in the design.

=== Prototypes ===
SSV-58 – The prototype submitted to trials by Dragunov. The design lacked the fixed flash hider and bayonet lug which was added to the rifle prior to adoption. The rear sights were mounted to the dust cover and were aperture sights instead of the standard notch sight.

TKB-0172 – An early bullpup design of the SVD developed by the Tula Sporting and Hunting Weapons Design Bureau in the 80&#x27;s. This rifle also had a significantly shortened barrel to reduce length.

V-70 – A prototype automatic rifle developed in 1968. It involved the development of a new bipod, a thicker and shorter barrel with a new muzzle device, and 15/20-round magazines. The detachable bipod designed for this project would be used in subsequent models of SVD.

AF – A prototype automatic rifle developed in the mid 70&#x27;s. The prototypes were chambered in 5.45×39mm and made compatible with AK-74 magazines (specifically, the 45-round magazine also compatible with the RPK-74).

SVDG (6V1-10) – A smoothbore SVD with a 10 mm bore developed alongside the modern intermediate cartridge program to use the experimental 3 mm APFSDS projectile, originally designed for use in standard machine guns. The design was not implemented due to the poor terminal ballistics of the projectile and the complexity of the new weapon.

SSV-6 (6V1-6) – Chambered in the experimental 6mm cartridge developed in the 80&#x27;s. The weapon was not adopted due to the poor effectiveness of the cartridge.

SVDK (6V9) – An experimental Russian variant chambered for the 9.3×64mm 7N33 cartridge, based on the civilian Tigr-9 design.

=== Civilian variants ===
Tigr – A civilian variant of the SVD, lacking a bayonet lug, first produced in the 1970s. Serial production for began in 1992 For export into the United States, the sear which prevented out-of-battery discharge had to be removed to comply with the National Firearms Act. Tiger rifles were available with shortened (520 mm) and full length (620 mm) barrels, different stocks (including an SVDS-style folding stock), and are chambered in 7.62×54mmR, .308 Winchester, .30-06 Springfield or 9.3×64mm Brenneke.

Kalashnikov TG3 – Civilian variant of the SVD from Kalashnikov Concern, chambered in 9.6×53mm Lancaster, first revealed in 2018. TG3 rifle weighs 3.9 kilograms (8 lb 9.5 oz). The overall length is 1,225 mm (48 inches) with a barrel length of 620 mm (24.4 inches). The TG3 uses 5-round single-stack detachable box magazines. The Tg3 is an oval-bore (Lancaster rifling) firearm. Although legally a shotgun, the TG3 is designed to offer rifle-like performance, at least at shorter distances. Russian gun laws restrict rifle ownership for newer gun owners but have far fewer restrictions on shotguns. The TG3 is similar to .366 tkm Ak platform weapons common in the Russian gun market.

=== Foreign variants ===
SWD-M – A modernised Polish variant of the SVD adopted in 1998 which uses a heavy barrel, bipod (mounted to the forearm) and LD-6 (6×42) telescopic sight.

Al-Kadesih – An Iraqi variant of the SVD, not to be confused with the Tabuk rifle. Although the design is very similar to the SVD, many parts are not interchangeable due to its unique dimensions and design characteristics. For example, the receiver is not milled and is slightly longer than that of the SVD, and the barrel is pinned to the receiver instead of being threaded. The rifle is also issued magazines with an ornamental palm tree relief.

Type 79/85 – A Chinese variant of the SVD. Although the design is nearly identical to the original SVD, some parts are not interchangeable, as the dimensions are slightly different from Soviet production rifles. A small quantity were also chambered in .308 Winchester for export. Exported rifles are often referred to as the NDM-86 or EM-351.

CS/LR19 or NSG-85 – A modernised Chinese variant of the Type 85 adopted by the PLA in 2014.

==Doctrine==
The SVD was used by designated marksmen designated in the Soviet Army as snipers at the basic motorized infantry rifle platoon level. For this purpose, the rifle was designed to be much lighter than more conventional precision rifles, making it better suited for use by infantry, and the rifle is autoloading in order to prioritize volume of fire over precision. It was thought that a relatively small number of marksmen armed with 7.62×54mmR fully powered cartridge chambered arms could assist conventional troops armed with 7.62×39mm intermediate cartridge chambered arms by suppressing/harassing valuable targets and assets (such as officers, radio operators, vehicle crews, other marksmen, machine gun teams, anti-tank warfare teams, etc.) with greater precision and at much greater ranges.

Once the rifle had been produced in sufficient numbers, every infantry platoon of Warsaw Pact troops included at least one SVD-equipped marksman. In the German Democratic Republic arsenals, there were almost 1,750. The marksmen were often chosen from personnel who displayed exceptional rifle marksmanship while members of DOSAAF. Such marksmen were estimated to have a 50% probability of hitting a standing, man-sized target at , and an 80% probability of hitting a standing, man-sized target at . To attain this level of accuracy the sniper could not engage more than two such targets per minute. For distances not exceeding the probability was estimated to be well above 90% regardless of time taken.

<text>Friedrich Robert Volkmann (6 April 1815 – 30 October 1883) was a German composer.

==Life==
Robert Volkmann was born in Lommatzsch near Meißen in the Kingdom of Saxony. His father, a music director for a church, trained him in music to prepare him as a successor. Thus, Volkmann learned to play the organ and the piano with his father, studied violin and cello with Friebel, and by age 12, he was playing the cello part in string quartets by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. In 1832, he entered the Freiberg Gymnasium for the purpose of becoming a teacher. There he studied music with August Ferdinand Anacker, who encouraged him to devote himself to music more fully. From there he went on to Leipzig in 1836 to study with Carl Ferdinand Becker. In Leipzig, he met Robert Schumann who encouraged him in his studies. They met again several times after that.

When he finished his studies, he began working as voice teacher at a music school in Prague. He did not stay there long, and in 1841 he moved to Budapest, where he was employed as a piano teacher and a reporter for the &quot;Allgemeine Wiener Musik-Zeitung&quot;.

After a short period of freelance work, he became the choirmaster and organist of a Reform synagogue in 1848. He composed in virtual obscurity until 1852, when his Piano Trio in minor caught the ears of Franz Liszt and Hans von Bülow, who proceeded to play it several times all over Europe. In 1854, Volkmann moved to Vienna, only to return to Budapest in 1858.

Thanks to the publisher Gustav Heckenast, who in 1857 bought the rights to publish all Volkmann&#x27;s works in exchange for regular income regardless of sales, Volkmann was able to fully dedicate himself to composition, until Heckenast closed down his Budapest publishing house in the early 1870s.

While visiting Vienna in 1864, Volkmann became acquainted with Johannes Brahms, and they became close friends. In letters they addressed each other as &quot;lieber Freund&quot; (&quot;dear friend&quot;).

From the 1870s Volkmann slowed down and composed very little. From 1875 until his death, he was professor of harmony and counterpoint at Budapest&#x27;s National Academy of Music, where Liszt was the director.

Volkmann died in Budapest aged 68.

<text>Harry Edwin Heilmann (August 3, 1894 – July 9, 1951), nicknamed &quot;Slug&quot;, was an American baseball player and radio announcer. He played professional baseball for 19 years between 1913 and 1932, including 17 seasons in Major League Baseball with the Detroit Tigers (1914, 1916–1929) and Cincinnati Reds (1930, 1932). He was a play-by-play announcer for the Tigers for 17 years from 1934 to 1950.

Heilmann won four American League batting championships, securing the honors in 1921, 1923, 1925 and 1927. He appeared in 2,147 major league games, including 1,525 games as a right fielder and 448 as a first baseman and compiled a career batting average of .342, the 12th highest in major league history, and third highest among right-handed batters. At the time of his retirement in 1932, Heilmann ranked sixth in major league history with 542 doubles and eighth with 1,543 RBIs. He remains one of only six players in American League history to hit .400 for a season, having accomplished the feat in 1923 with a .403 batting average. He also hit .394 in 1921. At his peak from 1921 to 1927, Heilmann compiled a .380 batting average, .452 on-base percentage, .583 slugging percentage, and averaged 116 RBI, 41 doubles, 11 triples, and 104 runs scored per season. From 1919 through 1930, Heilmann hit over .300 for 12 consecutive seasons.
He also compiled six 5-hit games and 49 4-hit games in his 17-year major league career.

After retiring from baseball, Heilmann ran unsuccessfully for the office of Detroit City Treasurer and operated a semipro baseball team in 1933 and, in 1934, began a career as a radio broadcaster. From 1934 to 1941, he was play-by-play announcer for the Tigers on station WXYZ and the Michigan Radio Network, covering parts of Michigan located outside metropolitan Detroit, while rival Ty Tyson called games for station WWJ in Detroit exclusively. From 1942 to 1950, Heilmann was the exclusive radio voice of the Tigers throughout the state. Heilmann died from lung cancer in July 1951; he was posthumously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame six months later in January 1952 after garnering 86.75% of the votes.

==Early years==
Heilmann was born in San Francisco in 1894. His father, Richard W. Heilmann, was born in 1860 at Sacramento, California, the son of an Irish mother and a father from Saxony. His mother, Mary (McVoy) Heilmann, sometimes referred to as Mollie, was born in 1864 in County Roscommon, Ireland. Harry was the couple&#x27;s fourth surviving child, having an older sister, May, and two older brothers, Richard Jr., and Walter. Heilmann&#x27;s father operated a soap business, ran as a Republican for the office of Supervisor of San Francisco&#x27;s Ninth Ward in 1896, and died in June 1897 at age 36. As a boy in the 1890s and continuing at least through the time of the 1900 Census, Heilmann lived with his family at 708A Brannan Street in what is now the South of Market district of San Francisco.

Heilmann&#x27;s older brother, Walter, was a gifted athlete who attended Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory (then &quot;Sacred Heart College&quot;) in San Francisco. On June 3, 1908, a year after the city&#x27;s devastation by earthquake, Walter died at age 16 while on a sailboat excursion with three schoolmates to visit the battleship &quot;USS Connecticut&quot; in drydock at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, near the present site of Candlestick Park. The boat capsized in a squall, and Walter drowned while trying to swim to shore; the other three boys were rescued.

As of 1910, Heilmann was living with his mother at 112 Sixteenth Street in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco. Heilmann followed his older brother to what is now Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory, where he played baseball, track and field, and basketball. He graduated from Sacred Heart in 1912 at age 17 with a collegiate certificate. After graduating from Sacred Heart, Heilmann worked as a bookkeeper for the Mutual Biscuit Company.

==Professional baseball career==

===Minor leagues===
Heilmann appeared in a semipro baseball game in 1913 for a team from Hanford, California. While playing for Hanford, he was signed by a scout for the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). After being signed by the Beavers, Heilmann was assigned to the Portland Colts of the Northwestern League. He compiled a .305 batting average in 122 games for the Colts.

===Detroit Tigers===

====1914 to 1920 seasons====

In September 1913, Heilmann was drafted by the Detroit Tigers. He made his major league debut with the Tigers on May 16, 1914, and played in 68 games that year, batting .225 and committing six errors in 31 games in the outfield (29 games in center field) for an .870 fielding percentage.

For the 1915 season, the Tigers sent Heilmann to the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). Heilmann missed the latter portion of the season after suffering from dizzy spells. Before the health problems sidelined him, Heilmann appeared in 98 games for the Seals and compiled a .364 batting average and .544 slugging percentage with 23 doubles and 12 home runs. His .364 batting average led the PCL for the 1915 season.

Heilmann returned to the Tigers in 1916 and appeared in 136 games, including 30 games at first base and 77 as an outfielder. Although his .282 batting average was low by the standards he would set later, he ranked among the American League leaders with 30 doubles (seventh best), 77 RBIs (sixth best) and 43 extra base hits (eighth). He also became a favorite in Detroit for his actions off the field. On July 25, 1916, he saved a woman whose vehicle had rolled into the Detroit River, diving into the water to rescue her, although two others died in the accident. His heroic act was reported in the national press, and he was loudly applauded at the next day&#x27;s game.

He continued to improve at the plate in 1917, once again ranking among the American League leaders with 85 RBIs (fourth), five home runs (seventh) and 11 triples (eighth); but he was called &quot;Slug&quot; due to his notoriously slow running and difficulties in the field. In 1917, the Tigers tried playing him in right field (95 games), center field (28) and first base (27), but he was not particularly good at any of those positions.

In 1918, Heilmann appeared in 79 games for the Tigers, 40 in right field and 37 at first base, compiling a .276 batting average. In mid-July 1918, he left the Tigers to enlist in the United States Navy during World War I. He served as a quartermaster on submarines off the West Coast of the United States.

He returned to the Tigers in 1919 and had his best season to date, ranking among the American League leaders with a .320 batting average (10th best), .477 slugging percentage (seventh), 92 RBIs (fourth), 53 extra base hits (fourth again), 15 triples (second), 256 total bases (fifth), 172 hits (sixth) and eight home runs (eighth). He had another strong year in 1920 with a .309 average, 41 extra base hits and 89 RBIs, but he continued to fall short in the field in those two years. Detroit manager Hughie Jennings made him the Tigers&#x27; starting first baseman, and he led the league in errors at that position both years, including 31 in 1919 for a .979 fielding percentage.

Heilmann was married on October 5, 1920, to Mary H. Maynes, commonly known as Mae. They had a daughter, Mary Ellen, and a son, Harry Jr., and lived in Detroit.

====1921 season====

In 1921, Heilmann appeared in 149 games, including 145 as the Tigers&#x27; starting right fielder. He won his first batting title, compiling a .394 batting average to outpace his manager and teammate Ty Cobb who hit .389. Unofficial figures released in October showed Cobb as the batting champion, but official figures released in December showed Heilmann to be the champion. He was the first right-handed batter to win the American League batting title since Nap Lajoie in 1905. Heilmann also led the American League in 1921 with 237 hits and ranked second behind Babe Ruth with 139 RBIs, 365 total bases, a .606 slugging percentage, 292 times on base, a 7.3 offensive wins above replacement (WAR) rating, and 159 runs created. He also ranked among the league leaders with a .444 on-base percentage (third behind Ruth and Cobb), 43 doubles (third behind Tris Speaker and Ruth), and 76 extra base hits (third behind Ruth and Bob Meusel).

Heilmann&#x27;s batting average in 1921 was 85 points higher than his 1920 average and 101 points higher than his career average prior to 1921. Some attributed Heilmann&#x27;s dramatic improvement to the tutelage of Ty Cobb, who took over as the Tigers&#x27; manager in 1921. Others attributed Heilmann&#x27;s improvement to the &quot;live-ball era&quot; that started in 1920 and forced outfielders to spread out and play deeper, allowing more of Heilmann&#x27;s line drives to fall into the wider gaps. However, Frank G. Menke attributed his improvement to having learned the game, noting that the &quot;lively ball&quot; failed to account for the fact that those who outhit Heilmann from 1914 to 1920 were no longer outhitting him. Menke observed:

There is nothing picturesque, nothing highly colored, nothing bombastic or spectacular about his methods. He is not a grandstander -- not theatrical. And because he isn&#x27;t, he does not get the acclaim and the plaudits which men, less wonderful, but better showmen, achieve for themselves.

Though primarily a line-drive hitter, Heilmann could also hit for power. His 19 home runs in 1921 ranked fifth in the American League, and he ranked among the league leaders in home runs 11 times. On July 8, 1921, Heilmann hit a home run off &quot;Bullet Joe&quot; Bush that traveled over the center field fence in Detroit and &quot;actually made the patrons gasp in astonishment.&quot; Heilmann&#x27;s home run was widely reported to have traveled 610 feet, eclipsing Babe Ruth&#x27;s longest home run of 465 feet. Detroit&#x27;s grounds keeper was more conservative, reporting that no measurement was made, but estimating that it traveled more than 500 feet. In a column published after the 1921 season, Grantland Rice rated Heilmann as the premier scholar in the American League&#x27;s School of Swat, ahead of Cobb and Ruth.

The entire Tiger lineup hit remarkably well in 1921. In addition to Heilmann and Cobb&#x27;s 1–2 finish for the batting title, Detroit&#x27;s third outfielder, Bobby Veach, was also among the league&#x27;s best at .338. The 1921 Tigers finished the season with a team batting average of .316, the highest in American League history and second highest in major league history. However, true to the baseball adage that good pitching beats good hitting, the 1921 Tigers lacked good pitching and finished in sixth place, 27 games behind the pennant-winning Yankees.

The 1921 season marked the start of a seven-year stretch in which Heilmann compiled a .380 batting average, .452 on-base percentage, .583 slugging percentage, and averaged 116 RBIs, 41 doubles, 11 triples, 15 home runs, and 104 runs scored.

====Batting style and speed====

Heilmann was known as a line drive hitter who clubbed the ball harder than any batter of his era with the exception of Babe Ruth. His one major handicap as a player was a lack of speed that led to his being known by the nickname &quot;Slug&quot;. He was long known as &quot;one of the slowest men in baseball.&quot; Hall of Fame sportswriter Tommy Holmes noted: &quot;Heilmann was never much faster than an ice wagon on the base paths. Without doubt, he is the slowest moving great hitter who ever lived.&quot; According to Holmes, Ty Cobb&#x27;s speed added 50 hits a year to his output, while Heilmann&#x27;s lack of speed robbed him of infield hits. Sportswriter Harry Grayson later wrote that Heilmann&#x27;s inability to beat out infield hits was the one thing that kept Heilmann from matching Rogers Hornsby as the greatest right-handed batter in baseball history.

====1922 season====

In February 1922, Heilmann refused to sign his contract, demanding to be paid $15,000. On March 3, 1922, Heilmann signed a contract for $12,500 with the Tigers, agreeing to report to spring training the following week. His spring training was then interrupted again in late March when he returned to Detroit to be with his wife for the birth of their son on March 28, 1922.

By late June, Heilmann was batting .387 and battling George Sisler for the American League batting championship. On August 26, 1922, Heilman&#x27;s season came to an end when he sustained a complete break of his collarbone when he crashed into Frank Brower while trying to beat out an infield hit. Heilmann had to have his collarbone rebroken and reset, and it was then discovered that Heilmann had also broken his shoulder. The injuries were so severe that Heilmann remained hospitalized until a week before the end of the season, and even after leaving the hospital, he feared he might never play again. Despite missing the last five weeks of the season, Heilmann hit a career-high 21 home runs, fourth in the American League, and also ranked among the league leaders with a .356 batting average (fourth), a .432 on-base percentage (fifth) and a .598 slugging percentage (fourth).

====1923 season====
In January 1923, while preparing for spring training and recuperating from his collar and shoulder injuries, Heilmann took up handball and quickly developed a reputation as one of the best players in the country. Heilmann&#x27;s efforts at handball also helped him shed excess weight, reporting in spring training at 200 pounds, 30 pounds less than he had reported in 1922.

During the 1923 season, Heilmann won his second batting title, hitting .403 for the season, edging out Babe Ruth who hit .393. Heilmann in 1923 became the fourth American League player to hit .400 or more for a season, joining Ty Cobb, Nap Lajoie and George Sisler. Only one other American League player, Ted Williams in 1941, has accomplished the feat since 1923.

In addition to winning the 1923 batting crown, Heilmann had one of his best seasons as a slugger. He finished second to Ruth in on-base percentage (.481), slugging percentage (.632) and wins above replacement (9.3). He also ranked among the American League leaders with 115 RBIs (third), 211 hits (third), 18 home runs (third), 121 runs scored (fourth), 331 total bases (fourth), 44 doubles (fourth), and 73 extra base hits (fourth). Despite hitting over .400, he finished third in the 1923 American League Most Valuable Player voting behind Ruth and Eddie Collins.

Heilmann in 1923 denied Ruth a Major League Baseball Triple Crown for the second time; Ruth led the league in home runs and RBIs in both 1921 and 1923, but was edged out in batting average in both years by Heilmann. In 1926, another Tiger, Heinie Manush, won the batting title to deny Ruth the triple crown a third time. Heilmann worked as a life insurance agent during the off-season in the 1920s. On October 16, 1923, after Ruth had received his World Series winner&#x27;s share‚ Heilmann‚ who was friends with Ruth despite having beaten him for the batting title‚ sold Ruth a $50‚000 life insurance policy.

====1924 season====
In 1924, Heilmann&#x27;s batting average dropped by 56 points to .346, which ranked sixth in the American League. Despite the &quot;slump&quot; in batting average, Heilmann led the league with 45 doubles and ranked second behind Babe Ruth with a .533 slugging percentage, a 6.4 wins above replacement rating among position players, and 130 runs created. He also ranked among the league leaders with 304 total bases (third), 71 extra base hits (third), 16 triples (third), 107 runs scored (fourth), 278 times on base (fourth), a .428 on-base percentage (fifth), and 114 RBIs (fifth). He appeared in 145 games as the Tigers&#x27; starting right fielder in 1924 and had his best defensive season, leading the league with 31 outfield assists; he never had more than 18 in any other season. He also led the league&#x27;s right fielders with 263 putouts. Heilmann finished ninth in the voting for the 1924 American League Most Valuable Player award.

====1925 season====
In 1925, Heilmann appeared in 150 games, 147 as Detroit&#x27;s starting right fielder, and won his third batting title, this time in a close race with Tris Speaker. Going into the final day of the season, Heilmann trailed Speaker and needed a strong performance to pass him. On the last day, the Tigers played a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns, and Heilmann had six hits, including a home run, in nine at bats. Heilmann finished with a .393 average, four points higher than Speaker. He was again among the American League leaders in most offensive categories, with 293 times on base (first), a 7.1 offensive wins above replacement rating (first), 134 RBIs (tied for first), 225 hits (third), a .457 on-base percentage (fourth), 326 total bases (fourth), a .569 slugging percentage (fifth), 40 doubles (fifth), and 64 extra base hits (fifth). Despite his accomplishments, the 1925 American League MVP award went to Roger Peckinpaugh, who hit almost 100 points below Heilmann and had 70 fewer RBIs than Heilmann but whose Senators repeated as pennant winners.

====1926 season====
In 1926, Heilmann appeared in 141 games, 133 as the Tigers&#x27; starting right fielder, and compiled a .367 batting average, .445 on-base percentage, and .534 slugging percentage. Heilmann ranked fourth in batting average in the American League, and the Detroit outfield took three of the top four spots in the batting race, as center fielder Heinie Manush won the batting crown with a .378 average, and left fielder Bob Fothergill finished third with a .367 average. Heilmann&#x27;s .445 on-base percentage was second best in the American League, and he once again hit more than 100 RBIs (had 101 RBIs) and finished fifth in American League MVP voting. On August 8, 1926, the Tigers held a Harry Heilmann Day at which Detroit Mayor John W. Smith presented Heilmann with a $5,000 Cadillac sports sedan, donated by Lawrence Fisher of Fisher Body, in front of a crowd of 40,000 spectators at Briggs Field.

====1927 season====
In 1927, Heilmann again appeared in 141 games, 135 as the starter in right field. He won his fourth and final batting crown with a .398 batting average in a close race with Al Simmons who hit .392. On August 13, Simmons led Heilmann by 26 points, .393 to .367, but Heilmann took the lead after totaling 27 hits in 11 games in the latter half of August. He then slumped in early September to fall behind Simmons and trailed by one point going into the last day of the season. On the final day of the season, in a doubleheader at Cleveland, Heilmann had seven hits in nine at bats, including two home runs and three doubles, to add seven points to his average and overtake Simmons to win the batting championship. He also ranked among the league leaders with a .475 on-base percentage (second), 120 RBIs (third), 201 hits (third), 50 doubles (third), 73 extra base hits (third), .616 slugging percentage (fourth), 311 total bases (fourth) and 106 runs scored (fifth). Despite winning his fourth batting title, Heilmann still finished second in the American League MVP voting, this time behind Lou Gehrig of the Murderers&#x27; Row 1927 Yankees.

When a reporter reminded him that he had won batting titles every odd-numbered year from 1921 to 1927, Heilmann replied: &quot;Mr. Navin [Detroit owner] gives me contracts on a two-year basis. I always bear down real hard when a new contract is coming up.&quot;

====1928 and 1929 seasons====
In 1928, Heilmann appeared in 151 games for the Tigers, 125 as the team&#x27;s starting right fielder and 24 as the starting first baseman. He compiled a .328 batting average, 70 points lower than his 1927 average of .398, but still seventh best in the American League. He also ranked among the American League leaders with 107 RBIs (fifth), 62 extra base hits (fifth), 283 total bases (fifth), 14 home runs (sixth), a .507 slugging percentage (eighth), 183 hits (eighth), and 38 doubles (eighth).

In 1929, Heilmann was suspended in the spring for &quot;indifferent training&quot; and then finished the season on the bench. He ended up appearing in 125 games, 111 as the team&#x27;s starting right fielder, and compiled a .344 batting average, ninth best in the American League. He again ranked among the league leaders with 120 RBIs (fifth), a .565 slugging percentage (seventh), 41 doubles (seventh), and a .412 on-base percentage (ninth).

===Cincinnati Reds===
In October 1929, the Tigers offered Heilmann on waivers to the other American League teams, but he went unclaimed, as no team was willing to pay the waiver price of $7,500. He was then sold by the Tigers to the Cincinnati Reds for a sum reported to be somewhat under $25,000. During the 1930 season, Heilmann appeared in 142 games with the Reds, 106 as the team&#x27;s starting right fielder and 19 at first base. He compiled a .333 batting average and .416 on-base percentage, the highest on the Cincinnati club in 1930. He also totaled 68 extra base hits, 19 home runs and 91 RBIs and ranked among the National League leaders with 43 doubles (seventh) and 64 bases on balls (eighth). While not previously known for his fielding, his 2.78 range factor in 1930 remains the second highest in major league history for a right fielder.

In March 1931, Heilmann was incapacitated by arthritis in his right wrist. The arthritis was so severe that he was hospitalized for a time in the spring. He ended up missing the entire 1931 season.

In January 1932, Heilmann was reported by the Reds to be in &quot;great shape&quot;. He trained himself in Hot Springs and reported in late February that he believed himself ready. However, he appeared in only 15 games for the Reds, primarily as a pinch hitter and in five games as the team&#x27;s starting first baseman. He compiled a .258 batting average in 31 at bats and appeared in his last major league game on May 31, 1932. He was released by the Reds on June 6, 1932. It was reported at the time that his arthritic wrist had &quot;lost its snap, and the power of his bat and throwing arm was gone.&quot;

==Radio career==
Heilmann worked in the insurance business in Cincinnati while he played for the Reds. After retiring from baseball in 1932, Heilmann returned to Detroit and continued there in the insurance business. He also ran in 1933 for the office of Detroit City Treasurer, losing decisively to Charles L. Williams by a margin of 138,478 votes for Williams to 68,695 for Heilmann. He also played sandlot baseball briefly for the Tool Shop team in the Detroit Amateur Baseball Federation. On June 4, 1933, a crowd of more than 20,000 spectators watched Heilmann&#x27;s return to baseball, as Heilmann had an RBI single in the first inning and made a &quot;big league catch&quot; in right field before a thunderstorm forced the cancellation of the game in the second inning. After a few games with Tool Shop, Heilmann organized his own team, known as Harry Heilmann&#x27;s All-Stars and consisting of former major league players, including Bobby Veach, Oscar Stanage, &quot;Leaping Mike&quot; Menosky, Marty Kavanagh, and Frank Fuller, which played games throughout Michigan and Ohio in July, August and September 1933, including a game against an African-American team from Akron.
In 1934, Heilman was hired by WXYZ to handle the play-by-play responsibility on broadcasts of Detroit Tigers games for the Michigan Radio Network. At the start of the 1934 season, he was paired with Harold True, but became a solo broadcaster by the end of the season and thereafter. During the Tigers&#x27; 1935 championship season, Heilmann broadcast all home games for the Tigers, while out-of-town games were relayed by telegraph with play-by-play being read by Bob Longstreet from the WXYZ studio in the Maccabees Building. In the fall of 1934, Heilmann also began broadcasting a football highlights show on Saturday evenings on the WXYZ and the Michigan Radio Network. In 1936, he also broadcast out-of-town Tigers games on CKLW radio. He also began broadcasting a sports interview show on WXYZ in 1936. In 1937, Heilmann further expanded his radio responsibilities with a daily recap of the day&#x27;s baseball games, broadcast at 5:30 p.m. on WXYZ. In 1938, he continued his broadcasts of Tigers home and out-of-town games on WXYZ, and added a 12:45 p.m. interview show with the fan on the street, broadcast Monday through Saturday on WXYZ.

As his popularity grew, Heilmann expanded outside the sports realm in 1939 with a new interview program co-hosted with WXYZ staff announcer John (&quot;Johnny&quot;) Slagle. The program was titled &quot;Town Meeting&quot; and was broadcast at 12:45 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays on WXYZ and the Michigan Radio Network. In the fall of 1939, Heilmann also joined Carl Gensel on broadcasts of Michigan State Spartans football games.

Through the Tigers&#x27; 1941 season, Heilmann was part of an unusual broadcasting arrangement. His WXYZ/Michigan Radio Network broadcasts were carried on affiliate stations throughout the state of Michigan, while Ty Tyson called the games separately on WWJ in Detroit. In the years of competing broadcasts, it took some time for Heilmann to develop a following. As one &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; reporter later noted:

A raspy voice, an Eastern accent and the contrast with Tyson&#x27;s polished delivery irritated some who listened to Harry. There was no such thing as a Tiger fan who liked both announcers — you were either a Tyson fan or a Heilmann fan, never both.

In 1942, the Tigers gave exclusive broadcast rights to WXYZ, making Heilmann the team&#x27;s sole radio voice both in Detroit and throughout Michigan. During his tenure as a Tigers announcer, he called the American League pennant-winning teams of 1940 and 1945.

Heilmann was known for his storytelling ability and for his in-depth knowledge of baseball. In 1951, &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; sports editor Lyall Smith described his broadcasting style:

In an era when radiomen frequently went into hysterics and fabricated spine-tingling situations, Harry was content to inform his listeners merely what actually happened on the diamond. These factual accounts were interspersed with tips on inside baseball and stories from his vast fund of diamond lore.

Baseball historian Marc Okkonen grew up listening to Heilmann&#x27;s broadcasts and later recalled Heilmann&#x27;s tendency to drop the letter &quot;r&quot; from the end of words, referring to Hal Newhouser as &quot;Newhousa&quot; and Bob Feller as &quot;Fellah&quot;. He also recalled that one of Heilmann&#x27;s sponsors was a fly spray called Bugaboo; when an outfielder would catch a fly ball, Heilmann would proclaim, &quot;Bugaboo! Another dead fly!&quot; Okkonenen also recalled Heilmann&#x27;s most memorable line, uttered after outstanding plays, when he would remain silent to emphasize the crowd noise and say, &quot;Listen ... to the voice of baseball.&quot;

In March 1946, Heilmann sustained five broken ribs and a broken chest bone in an automobile accident in Florida during spring training. Despite the injuries, he broadcast the Tigers games from opening day forward during the 1946 season.

On September 11, 1948, the Tigers held a Harry Heilmann Day at Briggs Stadium. He was honored between games of a double-header and presented with a solid gold pass for all games played at Briggs Stadium.

==Death==
Heilmann was ill for much of the winter after the 1950 season. On March 14, 1951, he collapsed at the Tigers&#x27; spring training camp in Lakeland, Florida. He was hospitalized at Morrell Hospital in Lakeland, and the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; reported two days later that he was in critical condition with a lung condition. At the end of March, after two weeks in the Lakeland hospital, the Tigers&#x27; owner Walter O. Briggs flew Heilmann back to Detroit on his private plane. Heilmann was taken by ambulance from the airport to Henry Ford Hospital, where he remained hospitalized. He remained hospitalized through the month of April, and Ty Tyson was selected to fill in for Heilmann on Tiger broadcasts during Heilmann&#x27;s illness. Heilmann was released from the hospital and returned home in May 1951. On June 1, 1951, he was greeted warmly by the crowd when he and his wife attended a game at Briggs Stadium. He also returned briefly to the Tiger broadcasts in early June, sharing the duties with Tyson and Paul Williams.

Heilmann was hospitalized again at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit on June 24 as his condition worsened, and he died there on July 9, 1951. It was only after his death that it was disclosed that the nature of his illness was lung cancer. Detroit mayor Albert Cobo recalled that Heilmann&#x27;s radio broadcasts made him &quot;almost a member of the family&quot; to Detroiters. Team owner Walter Briggs recalled Heilmann as one of his closest friends and said, &quot;I doubt whether the death of any other person in the State of Michigan could cause more genuine regret.&quot;

The 1951 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played in Detroit on the day after Heilmann died and began with a moment of silence in his honor. Heilmann&#x27;s funeral mass was celebrated by Father Charles Coughlin at the Shrine of the Little Flower in Royal Oak, Michigan. He was buried at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan.

==Career accomplishments and legacy==
Over the course of his major league career, Heilmann appeared in 2,147 games, including 1,525 games as a right fielder and 448 as a first baseman. He compiled a career batting average of .342 with a .410 on-base percentage and a .520 slugging percentage. Heilmann&#x27;s notable accomplishments include the following:
* Heilmann&#x27;s .342 batting average ranks 12th in major league history. Among right-handed batters, his average ranks third behind only Rogers Hornsby and Ed Delahanty. His .410 on-base percentage ranks 35th in major league history, and his .520 slugging percentage ranks 58th.
* Heilmann remains one of only six players in American League history to hit .400 for a season. The others are Nap Lajoie, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Ty Cobb, George Sisler, and Ted Williams. Heilmann accomplished the feat in 1923 with a .403 batting average. 
* He is one of six players to have won four or more American League batting titles. The others are Ty Cobb (twelve), Rod Carew (seven), Ted Williams (six), Wade Boggs (five), and Miguel Cabrera (four).
* At the time of his retirement in 1932, his 542 doubles ranked sixth in major league history, and his 1,543 RBIs ranked eighth in major league history.
* Heilmann&#x27;s 164 home runs while playing for Detroit was a club record when he was sold to the Reds at the end of the 1929 season; his record was broken in 1938 by Hank Greenberg.

In the weeks prior to Heilmann&#x27;s death, Ty Cobb led a campaign, supported by Arthur Daley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and H. G. Salsinger of &quot;The Detroit News&quot;, to hold a special election so that Heilmann could be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame before his death. Heilmann had received 87 of 167 ballots cast (52.1%) in 1950 and 153 of 226 ballots cast (67.7%) in 1951, below the 75% threshold. Heilmann died before action could be taken on the proposed special election, but on January 31, 1952, the National Baseball Hall of Fame announced that Heilmann would be inducted that summer, having garnered 203 of the 234 (86.75%) votes cast. He was represented by his widow at the induction ceremony in July 1952.

Heilmann has continued to be recognized as one of the greatest players in the history of the game. Significant honors include the following:
* In 1969, Heilmann was selected in fan voting as one of the three outfielders (Ty Cobb and Al Kaline were the others) on the all time Detroit Tigers team.
* In 1994, fellow Hall of Fame slugger Ted Williams rated Heilmann as the 17th best overall hitter of all time. 
* In 1999, Heilmann was ranked 54th on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of 100 Greatest Baseball Players.
* In 1999, he was selected as one of the 100 greatest players as part of the voting process for Major League Baseball&#x27;s All-Century Team.

<text>&quot;The Variable Man&quot; is a science fiction novella by American writer Philip K. Dick, which he wrote and sold before he had an agent. It was first published in the British magazine &quot;Space Science Fiction&quot; (British version) Vol. 2 No. 2, July 1953, and in the American version in September 1953, with the US publication illustrated by Alex Ebel. Despite the magazine cover dates it is unclear whether the first publication was in the UK or in the United States where magazines tended to be published farther ahead of their cover dates than in the UK. &quot;The Variable Man&quot; can be found in several collections of Dick&#x27;s short stories, including &quot;The Variable Man&quot; and &quot;The Short Happy Life of the Brown Oxford&quot;.

==Copyright status==
&quot;The Variable Man&quot; is in the public domain in the United States because it was published in the United States between January 1, 1950, and December 31, 1963, but copyright was not renewed with the United States Copyright Office within a year period beginning on December 31 of the 27th year of the copyright and running through December 31 of the following year. When renewal registration was not made within the statutory time limit copyright expired at the end of its first term and protection was lost permanently.

==Plot summary==
The human race has achieved space travel and begun to spread out from Earth, but is limited by an old and corrupt Centauran Empire, ruled from Proxima Centauri. The Empire fully encircles the Terran solar system and will not let the humans grow beyond it. Terra and the Centauran Empire effectively become locked in a cold war, with each side watching the other but neither side attacking. Terra uses the almost prophetic SRB machines to calculate their chances to win a war versus Centauri and updates these calculations with each new development.

Eventually Terra comes up with a concept for a bomb, called Icarus, that Proxima cannot defend against because it travels at faster-than-light (FTL) speeds. Icarus started as an experimental transport device, but the build-up of mass near light speed caused a huge explosion when the first prototype returned to sub-light speed, destroying the inventor and most of his equipment. Development of Icarus as a weapon alters the calculated odds in Terra&#x27;s favour. There are two problems; the first is that a second FTL device has not yet been made to work, and the second is the existence of a man from the past brought to the present. He is an &quot;unknown variable&quot; that confuses the SRB machines, making it impossible to accurately calculate the odds. That man is Thomas Cole, who became known as &quot;the Variable Man&quot;.

Cole is a man from 1913, the time just before the First World War. He is accidentally brought into the story&#x27;s present by a &quot;Time Bubble&quot; that was used for research about the past. The authorities attempt to capture him but he evades them and goes on the run. It is discovered that Cole has a genius for intuitively understanding and repairing machines, which he used to earn money as a repair man in his own time, and again while on the run. Other characters speculate that such abilities were more common in the pre-WWI era that produced Edison and other inventors. The engineer working on the FTL bomb realizes that the Variable Man might be able to make Icarus work, and manages to track him down. Cole agrees to help on the understanding that he will then be sent back to his own time with a quantity of precious metals to buy equipment for his repair business.

Cole eventually succeeds and an Icarus device is launched towards Proxima Centauri, with the intention of destroying the star along with its planets while Earth&#x27;s fleet attacks the empire&#x27;s forces in space. The device fails to affect its target, leading to a crushing defeat for Terra.

Investigation reveals that the star did not explode because Cole had made the Icarus device function fully according to its inventor&#x27;s intentions, solving the problem that had destroyed the prototype. Instead of a powerful bomb, humanity now has a working FTL drive that cannot be intercepted by the Centaurans. The Terran authorities realise they are now free to travel beyond the limits of the Centauran Empire and there is no further need for war.

<doc id="337519" wikidata="Q711745" url="?curid=337519" title="Sam Crawford">
<text>Samuel Earl Crawford (April 18, 1880 – June 15, 1968), nicknamed &quot;Wahoo Sam&quot;, was an American outfielder in Major League Baseball (MLB).

Crawford batted and threw left-handed, stood tall and weighed . Born in Wahoo, Nebraska, he had a short minor league baseball career before rapidly rising to the majors with the Cincinnati Reds in 1899. He played for the Reds until 1902.

Taking advantage of the competition for players between the National League and the then-ascendant American League, Crawford then joined the Detroit Tigers and played for Detroit, primarily in right field, from 1903 to 1917.

He was one of the greatest sluggers of his era, leading his league in home runs twice and in runs batted in three times. He still holds the MLB record for most career triples with 309, a record likely never to be broken.

While with the Tigers, Crawford played alongside superstar Ty Cobb, and the two had an intense rivalry while also helping Detroit win three American League championships from 1907 to 1909.

After his MLB career ended, Crawford moved to California, where he lived the rest of his life. He was a player and umpire in the Pacific Coast League and was a coach at the University of Southern California. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1957.

==Early life==
Crawford was born in Wahoo, Nebraska, in 1880, the son of Stephen O. Crawford (born 1842 in Vermont) and Nellie Crawford (born 1855 in Iowa). In 1901, he married Ada M. Lattin, born &quot;&quot; 1881 in Nebraska. He was listed as a ballplayer in 1910, and had one daughter, Virginia, born &quot;circa&quot; 1905 in Michigan. Various ship records confirm his birthdate and that of wife Ada. As of the 1920 U.S. census the family was living in Los Angeles, with other records establishing Samuel having arrived March 15, 1918.

According to a biography from the Nebraska Hall of Fame, Crawford was a star athlete at Wahoo High School, leading the team to two state football championships in 1896 and 1897 and was also noted for &quot;foot racing&quot; wherever he played. In 1898, he joined a traveling baseball team in Wahoo. They traveled on a lumber wagon from town to town for weeks at a time, challenging the locals to baseball games, and passing the hat to pay their expenses. Crawford was offered an opportunity in the spring of 1899 to play for the Chatham Reds of the Canadian League for $65 per month, plus board. Crawford seized the opportunity and left behind his job as a barber&#x27;s apprentice. From Chatham, Crawford moved on to play for the Grand Rapids Prodigals in the Western League.

==Major League Baseball career==
===Cincinnati Reds===
In September 1899, Grand Rapids sold Crawford to the Cincinnati Reds. Crawford played in 31 games for the Reds at the end of the 1899 season. At age 19, and one year removed from his days playing for Wahoo&#x27;s traveling team, Crawford was playing in the major leagues with future Hall of Famers Jake Beckley and Bid McPhee. Crawford hit .307 in 31 games with the Reds in 1899. In 1900, at age 20, he played in 101 games and was among the National League leaders in triples with 15 and home runs with seven.

Crawford was one of the best sluggers in baseball in 1901, batting .330 and hitting a major league leading 16 home runs. He was also third in the National League in triples (16), RBIs (104) and slugging percentage (.524). Crawford had another solid year in 1902, leading the National League in total bases (256) and triples (22), and placing second in batting average (.333), slugging percentage (.461) and extra base hits (43). He hit 12 inside-the-park home runs in 1901 – a major league record that has never been equaled.

===Detroit Tigers===

At the end of 1902, a bidding war for players developed between the National League and American League. Crawford signed contracts with both the Reds and the Detroit Tigers. The competing contracts led to a publicized legal dispute, with a judge ultimately awarding Crawford to the Tigers but requiring $3,000 in compensation to the Reds.

Crawford joined the Tigers for the 1903 season and remained there until the end of his major league career in 1917. In 1903, he led the American League with 25 triples, and finished second in the batting race with a .335 batting average.

With the addition of Ty Cobb at the end of the 1905 season, the Tigers had two of the best hitters in baseball. Cobb and Crawford led Detroit to three straight American League pennants in 1907, 1908 and 1909, but both of them slumped in their World Series appearances, as the Tigers lost all three. Crawford hit for a .243 average in three World Series, and Cobb hit an uncharacteristic .200 in the 1907 World Series and .231 in the 1909 World Series.

Although Crawford never got to play in another World Series, he remained one of the most feared hitters in baseball through 1915. In 1911, he hit a career-high .378 with 115 RBIs and 57 extra base hits. From 1913 to 1915, Crawford played in 472 consecutive games for the Tigers. Crawford was among the American League leaders in hits, RBIs, extra base hits, slugging percentage and total bases every year from 1905 to 1915. He led the American League in triples five times, including an American League record 26 triples in 1914. On August 23, 1913, Crawford hit his record-breaking 245th career triple in the first game of a doubleheader against the New York Yankees. He remains the all-time major league leader, retiring with 309 triples in his career.

Though his defense suffered in his later years, Crawford was a good fielder in his prime. In 1900, his range factor was 2.68 – 55 points higher than the league average of 2.13. In 1905, he led all American League outfielders with a .988 fielding percentage – 35 points higher than the league average.

Despite Crawford leading the league in both RBI (112) and extra base hits (54) in 1915, the Tigers began transitioning the right field responsibilities from Crawford to their young hitting star, future Baseball Hall of Famer Harry Heilmann in 1916. That year, Crawford played 78 games in right field, and Heilmann played 66, with Crawford&#x27;s plate appearances cut almost in half from 694 to 368.

In 1917, Crawford lost his spot in the lineup altogether and was relegated principally to a pinch-hitting role. In his new limited role, Crawford hit .173 in 104 at bats. At the end of the 1917 season, Crawford was released and did not play in Major League Baseball again.

===Career accomplishments===
Crawford was one of the greatest sluggers of the dead-ball era. He still holds the major league records for triples in a career (309) and inside-the-park home runs in a season (12). He has the second most inside-the-park home runs in a career (51), and the remarkable distinction of hitting more &quot;triples&quot; than doubles four times in his career: 22 to 18 in 1902, 25 to 23 in 1903, 26 to 22 in 1914, and 13 to 11 in 1916, the last at the ripe old age for a ballplayer of his era of 36.

Crawford became the first player to lead both the National League and American League in home runs (1901 and 1908). He was among the AL leaders in hits, RBI, extra base hits, slugging percentage and total bases for 11 consecutive years, from 1905 to 1915. Using Baseball-Reference.com&#x27;s &quot;Gray Ink Test&quot;, which awards points based on how often a player is among the league batting leaders, Crawford ranks as the ninth in baseball history. He finished his career with 2,961 hits and a .309 batting average. He ranks fifth on the Detroit Tigers all-time hits list with 2,466 hits as a Tiger.

Ed Barrow, who managed Crawford in his first two years with Detroit, and went on to convert Babe Ruth to an outfielder as general manager of the Yankees, once said that there never was a better hitter than Crawford. One of his contemporaries, Fielder Jones, said of Crawford: &quot;None of them can hit quite as hard as Crawford. He stands up at the plate like a brick house and he hits all the pitchers, without playing favorites.&quot;

===Rivalry with Ty Cobb===

Sam Crawford and Ty Cobb were teammates for parts of 13 seasons. They played beside each other in right and center field, and Crawford followed Cobb in the batting order year after year. Despite this, the two had a complicated relationship.

When Cobb entered the major leagues with the Tigers in 1905, Crawford was one of the Detroit veterans who bullied Cobb. Cobb, a volatile personality, took it personally. However, Cobb soon became established as the best hitter in the game and became more accepted on the Tigers team as they won AL championships in 1907, 1908 and 1909. During this time, Cobb and Crawford had a student-teacher relationship. In interviews late in life with Al Stump, Cobb told of studying Crawford&#x27;s base-stealing technique and of how Crawford would teach him about pursuing fly balls and throwing out base runners. Cobb said that he would always remember Crawford&#x27;s kindness.

The student-teacher relationship gradually changed to one of jealous rivals. Cobb was unpopular with his teammates, and as he became the biggest star in baseball, Crawford was unhappy with the preferential treatment given Cobb. Cobb was allowed to report late for spring training and given private quarters on the road – privileges not offered to Crawford. The competition between the two was intense. Crawford recalled that, if he went three for four on a day when Cobb went hitless, Cobb would turn red and sometimes walk out of the park with the game still on. When it was initially (and erroneously) reported that Nap Lajoie had won the batting title in 1910, Crawford was alleged to have been one of several Tigers who sent a telegram to Lajoie congratulating him on beating Cobb.

In retirement, Cobb wrote a letter to a writer for &quot;The Sporting News&quot; accusing Crawford of not helping in the outfield and of intentionally fouling off balls when Cobb was stealing a base. Crawford learned about the letter in 1946 and accused Cobb of being a &quot;cheapskate&quot; who never helped his teammates. He said that Cobb had not been a very good fielder, &quot;so he blamed me.&quot; Crawford denied intentionally trying to deprive Cobb of stolen bases, saying that Cobb had &quot;dreamed that up.&quot;

When asked about the feud, Cobb attributed it to jealousy. He felt that Crawford was &quot;a hell of a good player&quot;, but he was &quot;second best&quot; on the Tigers and &quot;hated to be an also ran.&quot; Cobb biographer Richard Bak noted that the two &quot;only barely tolerated each other&quot; and agreed with Cobb that Crawford&#x27;s attitude was driven by Cobb&#x27;s having stolen Crawford&#x27;s thunder.

Although they may not have spoken to each other, Cobb and Crawford developed an uncanny ability to communicate non-verbally with looks and nods on the base paths. They became one of the most successful double steal pairings in baseball history.

After Cobb died, a reporter found hundreds of letters in his home responding to letters Cobb had written to influential people, lobbying for Crawford&#x27;s induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Crawford was reportedly unaware of Cobb&#x27;s efforts until after Cobb died.

==Later baseball career==
After being released by the Tigers, Crawford joined the minor league Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, helping them to win league championships in 1918 and 1921. In his first game he got two hits, stole a base and threw out two runners. Crawford played four seasons for the Angels (1918–1921). In 1918 he played in 96 games, got 104 hits, and batted .292. 
In 1919 he hit .360 with 239 hits, 41 doubles, 18 triples, 14 home runs and 14 stolen bases in 173 games. (The PCL played an irregular schedule, with substantially more games than the then 154-game Major League season.) In 1920 he batted .332 and had 239 hits, 46 doubles and 21 triples in 187 games. His last year, at 41 years-old in 1921, he hit .316 with 199 hits and 44 doubles in 175 games.
Crawford decided to stay in Southern California, and in 1924 became the head coach of the University of Southern California (USC) baseball team, a position he held until 1929. He was instrumental in the development of the California Intercollegiate Baseball Association in 1927, and led USC to second-place finishes in his last two seasons. Crawford was 59–46–3 as the USC coach. He later worked as an umpire in the Pacific Coast League from 1935 to 1938, quitting after finding it a thankless job and lonely life.

In 1927, Crawford had a role as the baseball coach in Buster Keaton&#x27;s comedy film &quot;College&quot;.

==Later life==

In retirement, Crawford became somewhat reclusive, staying away from official baseball functions. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1957. At the time, he was living in a small cabin on the edge of the Mojave Desert near Pearblossom, California. Reporters showed up there with the news, shocking the locals, who were unaware that their neighbor had even played Major League Baseball. After his election, Crawford told the curator in Cooperstown that he wanted his plaque to read &quot;Wahoo Sam.&quot; He noted: &quot;That&#x27;s my hometown, and I&#x27;m proud of it.&quot;

Crawford spent much of his later years working in his garden and reading. In March 1964, in Baywood Park, California, he was interviewed by Lawrence Ritter for the 1966 book &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;, a series of interviews with the players of the early 20th century. Crawford&#x27;s tales of teammates such as Cobb and deaf player Dummy Hoy, and opponents such as Honus Wagner, helped to make the book one of the most admired ever written about baseball. During the Ritter interviews, Crawford quoted from the works of philosopher George Santayana and agnostic Robert Ingersoll, and discussed the works of one of his favorite writers, Honoré de Balzac. As for how he hoped to be remembered, he said: &quot;When I kick off they&#x27;ll say, &#x27;Well, good old Sam, he wasn&#x27;t such a bad guy after all. Everything considered, he was pretty fair and square. We&#x27;ll miss him.&#x27;&quot;

Crawford suffered a stroke on May 26, 1968, and died two weeks later at Hollywood Community Hospital in Los Angeles at age 88. He was interred in the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood. In 1999, Crawford was ranked number 84 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

<text>Eolas (, meaning &quot;Knowledge&quot;; bacronym: &quot;Embedded Objects Linked Across Systems&quot;) is a United States technology firm formed as a spin-off from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), in order to commercialize UCSF&#x27;s patents for work done there by Eolas&#x27; co-founders, as part of the Visible Embryo Project. The company was founded in 1994 by Dr. Michael Doyle, Rachelle Tunik, David Martin, and Cheong Ang from the UCSF Center for Knowledge Management (CKM). The company was created at the request of UCSF, and was founded by the inventors of the university&#x27;s patents.

In addition to the work done while at UCSF, Dr. Doyle has led work at Eolas to create new technologies ranging from Spatial Genomics/Spatial transcriptomics, Code signing, transient-key cryptography, and blockchain to mobile AI assistants and automated audio conversation annotation.

The University of California, San Francisco CKM team created an advanced early web browser that supported plugins, streaming media, and cloud computing, which could provide seamless access to potentially-unlimited remote high-performance computational capabilities. They demonstrated it at Xerox PARC, in November 1993, at the second Bay Area SIGWEB meeting. The claim that the plug-in/applet functionality was an innovation, advanced to justify their patent application, has been contested by Pei-Yuan Wei, who developed the earlier Viola browser, which added scripted-app capabilities in 1992, a claim supported by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the WWW, and other Web pioneers. Given only a short time to prepare, Wei was only able to demonstrate Viola&#x27;s equivalent capabilities for local rather than remote files at the 2003 Eolas v. Microsoft trial, and thus fell short of proving prior art to the trial court&#x27;s satisfaction. The case with Microsoft over patent 5,838,906 was settled in 2007 for a confidential amount of money after an initial $565 million judgment was stayed on appeal, but the University of California disclosed its piece of the final settlement as $30.4 million. In 2009 Eolas sued numerous other companies over patent number 7,599,985 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. As of June 2011, a number of these companies, including Texas Instruments, Oracle and JPMorgan Chase, had signed licensing deals with Eolas, while the company continued to seek licenses from others.

In February 2012, an eight-person jury in the Eastern District of Texas invalidated some of the claims in the ’906 and ’985 patents, and in July 2012, Judge Leonard Davis ruled against Eolas. One year later, moreover, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sustained that ruling.

However, after a new patent covering cloud computing on the Web was granted to Eolas in November 2015, Eolas filed a new lawsuit against Google, Amazon and Walmart, which is currently underway in the Northern District of California.

==Products==
In September 1995, the founders of Eolas released WebRouser, an advanced Web browser based on Mosaic that implemented plugins, client-side image maps, web-page-defined browser buttons and menus, embedded streaming media, and cloud computing capabilities. In 2005, Eolas released &#x27;Muse&#x27;, a &quot;multimedia doodling application,&quot; which it later licensed to Iconicast LLC, to use as the basis for an iOS app called &#x27;HueTunes&#x27;. The HueTunes app was featured at the DEMO conference in 2013. In 2012, Eolas developed the Einstein Brain Atlas iPad app for the National Museum of Health and Medicine Chicago, which was named the Gizmodo App of the Day. According to the Eolas Web site, their current products include two health-education systems: the AnatLab Visible Human, used to teach gross anatomy to medical students, and AnatLab Histology, an iOS and Android app that provides mobile access to a complete collection of ultra-high-resolution histology microscopic slide images.

==Patents==
US patent 5,838,906, titled &quot;Distributed hypermedia method for automatically invoking external application providing interaction and display of embedded objects within a hypermedia document,&quot; was filed on October 17, 1994 and granted on November 17, 1998.

In Autumn 2003, the inventor of the World Wide Web and the Director of the W3C Consortium Tim Berners-Lee wrote to the Under Secretary of Commerce, asking for this patent to be invalidated, in order to &quot;eliminate this major impediment to the operation of the Web&quot;. Leaders of Open Source Community sided with Microsoft in fighting the patent due to its threat to the free nature of the Web and to the basic established HTML standards. The specific concerns of having one company (Eolas) controlling a critical piece of the Web framework were cited.

In March 2004, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) re-examined and initially rejected the patent. Eolas submitted a rebuttal in May 2004. On September 27, 2005, the USPTO upheld the validity of the patent. The PTO ruling rejected the relevance of Pei Wei&#x27;s Viola code to the Eolas patent. According to the University of California press release, &quot;In its &#x27;Reasons for Patentability/Confirmation&#x27; notice, the patent examiner rejected the arguments for voiding UC&#x27;s previously approved patent claims for the Web-browser technology as well as the evidence presented to suggest that the technology had been developed prior to the UC innovation. The examiner considered the Viola reference the primary reference asserted by Microsoft at trial as a prior art publication and found that Viola does &#x27;not teach nor fairly suggest that instant 906 invention, as claimed.&#x27;&quot;

Eolas was granted a second patent in October 2009 related to the same technology.

After considering the evidence asserted at the 2012 trial, including Viola, the US Patent Office granted Eolas a new patent in November 2015 with claims which generally cover cloud computing on the Web.

All of the above patents had expired by September 2017.

==Litigation==
Microsoft declined to license the technology when it was offered to them (and others) in 1994.

In 1999, Eolas filed suit in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Microsoft over validity and use of the patent. Eolas won the initial case in August 2003 and was awarded damages of $ from Microsoft for infringement. The District Court reaffirmed the jury&#x27;s decision in January 2004.

In June 2004, Microsoft appealed the case to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2005, the District Court judgment was remanded, but the infringement and damages parts of the case were upheld. The appeals court ruled that the two Viola-related exhibits that had been thrown out of the original trial needed to be shown to a jury in a retrial. Microsoft quickly filed for a rehearing.

In October 2005, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear Microsoft&#x27;s appeal, leaving intact the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in favor of Eolas with respect to foreign sales of Microsoft Windows. However, the remand to District Court had not been heard yet.

In May 2007, the USPTO agreed to allow Microsoft to argue ownership of the patent after they reissued a Microsoft patent that covers the same concepts as outlined in the Eolas patent, and contains wording that mirrors the Eolas patent.
The USPTO ruled in favor of Eolas on that matter in September 2007.

Microsoft and Eolas agreed in July 2007 to delay a pending re-trial, in order to negotiate a settlement. On August 27, 2007, Eolas reported to its shareholders that a settlement had been reached and that Eolas expected to pay a substantial dividend as a result; the exact amount and terms of the settlement were not disclosed.

In October 2009, Eolas sued a number of large corporations for infringement of the same patent. The 22 sued corporations include Adobe, Amazon.com, Apple, Argosy Publishing, Blockbuster, CDW Corp., Citigroup, eBay, Frito-Lay, The Go Daddy Group, Google, J.C. Penney Co. Inc., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., New Frontier Media Inc., Office Depot Inc., Perot Systems Corp., Playboy Enterprises International Inc., Rent-A-Center Inc., Staples Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc., Texas Instruments Inc., Yahoo! Inc., and YouTube LLC. Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, writing in Computerworld&#x27;s opinion section, called Eolas a patent troll after these lawsuits were initiated. As of June 2011, a number of these companies, including Texas Instruments, Oracle and JPMorgan Chase have signed licensing deals with Eolas, while others are still litigating.

In February 2012, a Texas jury found that some of the claims in two of Eolas&#x27; patents were invalid after testimony from several defendants including Tim Berners-Lee and Pei-Yuan Wei, credited as creator of the Viola browser. The testimony professed that the Viola browser included Eolas&#x27; claimed plugin invention before their conception date (September 7, 1993). There is &quot;substantial evidence that Viola was publicly known and used&quot; before the plaintiffs&#x27; alleged conception date, it added. The ruling effectively ended a pending lawsuit against Yahoo, Google, Amazon and JC Penney.

On July 23, 2013, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has nationwide jurisdiction, affirmed a Texas federal court which had ruled in July 2012 that several claims relating to the two patents in the suit were invalid, a ruling which Eolas had appealed.

After the US Patent Office considered the evidence asserted at the 2012 trial, including Viola, it granted Eolas a new patent in November 2015 with claims which generally cover cloud computing on the Web. Eolas then filed a new lawsuit against Google, Amazon and Walmart, which is currently underway in the Northern District of California.

== Effects on other browsers ==

In February 2006, Microsoft modified its Internet Explorer web browser to attempt to side-step the Eolas patent. The change, first discussed in 2003,
requires users to click once on an ActiveX control to &quot;activate&quot; it before they could use its interface. The specific message is &quot;Click to activate this control&quot;, shown as a tooltip when the cursor is held over the embedded object. However, following a November 2007 announcement that Microsoft had &quot;licensed the technologies from Eolas&quot;,
in April 2008, Microsoft released an update which removed the click-to-activate functionality, reverting the software to its original design.

In June 2006, Opera Software released version 9 of its Opera browser for Windows and other operating systems, with modifications similar to Microsoft&#x27;s.

Doyle has stated that Eolas will offer royalty-free licenses to non-commercial entities. A statement on Eolas&#x27; web site clarifies the company&#x27;s policy with regard to such licenses. , Mozilla Foundation, which develops the open-source Mozilla Firefox browser, has not announced that it has requested any license to the Eolas patents; the last of these patents expired prior to the end of 2017.

=== Proposed Workarounds ===

Before some claims in the company&#x27;s patents were invalidated in 2012, one proposed workaround was to dynamically create the HTML element containing the plug-in using JavaScript, rather than embedding it on the page. In this situation, Internet Explorer did not ask the user for an &quot;activation&quot; click because of the infringers&#x27; argument that the patent did not cover embedded scripting.

Opera users could use User JavaScript functionality in the browser to attempt to work around this issue in a similar way with locally modified JavaScript.

<text>The Delphi method or Delphi technique ( ; also known as Estimate-Talk-Estimate or ETE) is a structured communication technique or method, originally developed as a systematic, interactive forecasting method that relies on a panel of experts. Delphi has been widely used for business forecasting and has certain advantages over another structured forecasting approach, prediction markets. 

Delphi can also be used to help reach expert consensus and develop professional guidelines. It is used for such purposes in many health-related fields, including clinical medicine, public health, and research.

Delphi is based on the principle that forecasts (or decisions) from a structured group of individuals are more accurate than those from unstructured groups. The experts answer questionnaires in two or more rounds. After each round, a facilitator or change agent provides an anonymised summary of the experts&#x27; forecasts from the previous round as well as the reasons they provided for their judgments. Thus, experts are encouraged to revise their earlier answers in light of the replies of other members of their panel. It is believed that during this process the range of the answers will decrease and the group will converge towards the &quot;correct&quot; answer. Finally, the process is stopped after a predefined stopping criterion (e.g., number of rounds, achievement of consensus, stability of results), and the mean or median scores of the final rounds determine the results. 

Special attention has to be paid to the formulation of the Delphi theses and the definition and selection of the experts in order to avoid methodological weaknesses that severely threaten the validity and reliability of the results.

==History==
The name &quot;Delphi&quot; derives from the Oracle of Delphi, although the authors of the method were unhappy with the oracular connotation of the name, &quot;smacking a little of the occult&quot;. The Delphi method assumes that group judgments are more valid than individual judgments.

The Delphi method was developed at the beginning of the Cold War to forecast the impact of technology on warfare. In 1944, General Henry H. Arnold ordered the creation of the report for the U.S. Army Air Corps on the future technological capabilities that might be used by the military.

Different approaches were tried, but the shortcomings of traditional forecasting methods, such as theoretical approach, quantitative models or trend extrapolation, quickly became apparent in areas where precise scientific laws have not been established yet. To combat these shortcomings, the Delphi method was developed by Project RAND during the 1950-1960s (1959) by Olaf Helmer, Norman Dalkey, and Nicholas Rescher. It has been used ever since, together with various modifications and reformulations, such as the Imen-Delphi procedure.

Experts were asked to give their opinion on the probability, frequency, and intensity of possible enemy attacks. Other experts could anonymously give feedback. This process was repeated several times until a consensus emerged.

In 2021, a cross-disciplinary study by Beiderbeck et al. focused on new directions and advancements of the Delphi method, including Real-time Delphi formats. The authors provide a methodological toolbox for designing Delphi surveys including among others sentiment analyses of the field of psychology.

==Key characteristics==
The following key characteristics of the Delphi method help the participants to focus on the issues at hand and separate Delphi from other methodologies: in this technique a panel of experts is drawn from both inside and outside the organisation. The panel consists of experts having knowledge of the area requiring decision making. Each expert is asked to make anonymous predictions.

===Anonymity of the participants===
Usually all participants remain anonymous. Their identity is not revealed, even after the completion of the final report. This prevents the authority, personality, or reputation of some participants from dominating others in the process. Arguably, it also frees participants (to some extent) from their personal biases, minimizes the &quot;bandwagon effect&quot; or &quot;halo effect&quot;, allows free expression of opinions, encourages open critique, and facilitates admission of errors when revising earlier judgments.

=== Structuring of information flow ===
The initial contributions from the experts are collected in the form of answers to questionnaires and their comments to these answers. The panel director controls the interactions among the participants by processing the information and filtering out irrelevant content. This avoids the negative effects of face-to-face panel discussions and solves the usual problems of group dynamics.

===Regular feedback===
The Delphi method allows participants to comment on the responses of others, the progress of the panel as a whole, and to revise their own forecasts and opinions in real time.

===Role of the facilitator===
The person coordinating the Delphi method is usually known as a &quot;facilitator&quot; or Leader, and facilitates the responses of their &quot;panel of experts&quot;, who are selected for a reason, usually that they hold knowledge on an opinion or view. The facilitator sends out questionnaires, surveys etc. and if the panel of experts accept, they follow instructions and present their views. Responses are collected and analyzed, then common and conflicting viewpoints are identified. If consensus is not reached, the process continues through thesis and antithesis, to gradually work towards synthesis, and building consensus. 

During the past decades, facilitators have used many different measures and thresholds to measure the degree of consensus or dissent. A comprehensive literature review and summary is compiled in an article by von der Gracht.

==Applications==

===Use in forecasting===
First applications of the Delphi method were in the field of science and technology forecasting. The objective of the method was to combine expert opinions on likelihood and expected development time, of the particular technology, in a single indicator. One of the first such reports, prepared in 1964 by Gordon and Helmer, assessed the direction of long-term trends in science and technology development, covering such topics as scientific breakthroughs, population control, automation, space progress, war prevention and weapon systems. Other forecasts of technology were dealing with vehicle-highway systems, industrial robots, intelligent internet, broadband connections, and technology in education.

Later the Delphi method was applied in other places, especially those related to public policy issues, such as economic trends, health and education. It was also applied successfully and with high accuracy in business forecasting. For example, in one case reported by Basu and Schroeder (1977), the Delphi method predicted the sales of a new product during the first two years with inaccuracy of 3–4% compared with actual sales. Quantitative methods produced errors of 10–15%, and traditional unstructured forecast methods had errors of about 20%. (This is only one example; the overall accuracy of the technique is mixed.)

The Delphi method has also been used as a tool to implement multi-stakeholder approaches for participative policy-making in developing countries. The governments of Latin America and the Caribbean have successfully used the Delphi method as an open-ended public-private sector approach to identify the most urgent challenges for their regional ICT-for-development eLAC Action Plans. As a result, governments have widely acknowledged the value of collective intelligence from civil society, academic and private sector participants of the Delphi, especially in a field of rapid change, such as technology policies.

=== Use in patent participation identification ===
In the early 1980s Jackie Awerman of Jackie Awerman Associates, Inc. designed a modified Delphi method for identifying the roles of various contributors to the creation of a patent-eligible product. (Epsilon Corporation, Chemical Vapor Deposition Reactor) The results were then used by patent attorneys to determine bonus distribution percentage to the general satisfaction of all team members.

===Use in policy-making===
From the 1970s, the use of the Delphi technique in public policy-making introduces a number of methodological innovations. In particular:
* the need to examine several types of items (not only &quot;forecasting&quot; items but, typically, &quot;issue&quot; items, &quot;goal&quot; items, and &quot;option&quot; items) leads to introducing different evaluation scales which are not used in the standard Delphi. These often include &quot;desirability&quot;, &quot;feasibility&quot; (technical and political) and &quot;probability&quot;, which the analysts can use to outline different scenarios: the &quot;desired&quot; scenario (from desirability), the &quot;potential&quot; scenario (from feasibility) and the &quot;expected&quot; scenario (from probability);
* the complexity of issues posed in public policy-making tends to increase weighting of panelists’ arguments, such as soliciting pros and cons for each item along with new items for panel consideration;
* likewise, methods measuring panel evaluations tend to increase sophistication such as multi-dimensional scaling.

Further innovations come from the use of computer-based (and later web-based) Delphi conferences. According to Turoff and Hiltz, in computer-based Delphis: 
* the iteration structure used in the paper Delphis, which is divided into three or more discrete rounds, can be replaced by a process of continuous (roundless) interaction, enabling panelists to change their evaluations at any time;
* the statistical group response can be updated in real-time, and shown whenever a panelist provides a new evaluation.

According to Bolognini, web-based Delphis offer two further possibilities, relevant in the context of interactive policy-making and e-democracy. These are: 
* the involvement of a large number of participants,
* the use of two or more panels representing different groups (such as policy-makers, experts, citizens), which the administrator can give tasks reflecting their diverse roles and expertise, and make them to interact within ad hoc communication structures. For example, the &quot;policy community&quot; members (policy-makers and experts) may interact as part of the &quot;main conference&quot; panel, while they receive inputs from a &quot;virtual community&quot; (citizens, associations etc.) involved in a &quot;side conference&quot;. These web-based variable communication structures, which he calls &quot;Hyperdelphi&quot; (HD), are designed to make Delphi conferences &quot;more fluid and adapted to the hypertextual and interactive nature of digital communication&quot;.
One successful example of a (partially) web-based policy Delphi is the five-round Delphi exercise (with 1,454 contributions) for the creation of the eLAC Action Plans in Latin America. It is believed to be the most extensive online participatory policy-making foresight exercise in the history of intergovernmental processes in the developing world at this time. In addition to the specific policy guidance provided, the authors list the following lessons learned: &quot;(1) the potential of Policy Delphi methods to introduce transparency and accountability into public decision-making, especially in developing countries; (2) the utility of foresight exercises to foster multi-agency networking in the development community; (3) the usefulness of embedding foresight exercises into established mechanisms of representative democracy and international multilateralism, such as the United Nations; (4) the potential of online tools to facilitate participation in resource-scarce developing countries; and (5) the resource-efficiency stemming from the scale of international foresight exercises, and therefore its adequacy for resource-scarce regions.&quot;

=== Use in health settings ===
The Delphi technique is widely used to help reach expert consensus in health-related settings. For example, it is frequently employed in the development of medical guidelines and protocols.

==== Public health ====

Some examples of its application in public health contexts include non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, iodine deficiency disorders, building responsive health systems for communities affected by migration, the role of health systems in advancing well-being for those living with HIV, on policies and interventions to reduce harmful gambling, on the regulation of electronic cigarettes and on recommendations to end the COVID-19 pandemic.

==== Reporting guidelines====
Use of the Delphi method in the development of guidelines for the reporting of health research is recommended, especially for experienced developers. Since this advice was made in 2010, two systematic reviews have found that fewer than 30% of published reporting guidelines incorporated Delphi methods into the development process.

=== Online Delphi systems ===

A number of Delphi forecasts are conducted using web sites that allow the process to be conducted in real-time. For instance, the TechCast Project uses a panel of 100 experts worldwide to forecast breakthroughs in all fields of science and technology. Another example is the Horizon Project, where educational futurists collaborate online using the Delphi method to come up with the technological advancements to look out for in education for the next few years.

==Variations==
Traditionally the Delphi method has aimed at a consensus of the most probable future by iteration. Other versions, such as the Policy Delphi, offer decision support methods aiming at structuring and discussing the diverse views of the preferred future.

In Europe, more recent web-based experiments have used the Delphi method as a communication technique for interactive decision-making and e-democracy.

The Argument Delphi, developed by Osmo Kuusi, focuses on ongoing discussion and finding relevant arguments rather than focusing on the output. The Disaggregative Policy Delphi, developed by Petri Tapio, uses cluster analysis as a systematic tool to construct various scenarios of the future in the latest Delphi round. The respondent&#x27;s view on the probable and the preferable future are dealt with as separate cases. The computerization of Argument Delphi is relatively difficult because of several problems like argument resolution, argument aggregation and argument evaluation. The computerization of Argument Delphi, developed by Sadi Evren Seker, proposes solutions to such problems.

A fast-track Delphi was developed to provide consensual expert opinion on the state of scientific knowledge in public health crises. It can provide results within three weeks, while the conventional Delphi can take several months (sometimes years).

==Accuracy==

Today the Delphi method is a widely accepted forecasting tool and has been used successfully for thousands of studies in areas varying from technology forecasting to drug abuse.
Overall the track record of the Delphi method is mixed. There have been many cases when the method produced poor results. Still, some authors attribute this to poor application of the method and not to the weaknesses of the method itself. The &quot;RAND Methodological Guidance for Conducting and Critically Appraising Delphi Panels&quot; is a manual for doing Delphi research which provides guidance for doing research and offers a appraisal tool. This manual gives guidance on best practices that will help to avoid, or mitigate, potential drawbacks of Delphi Method Research; it also helps to understand the confidence that can be given to study results. 

It must also be realized that in areas such as science and technology forecasting, the degree of uncertainty is so great that exact and always correct predictions are impossible, so a high degree of error is to be expected. An important challenge for the method is ensuring sufficiently knowledgeable panelists. If panelists are misinformed about a topic, the use of Delphi may only add confidence to their ignorance.

One of the initial problems of the method was its inability to make complex forecasts with multiple factors. Potential future outcomes were usually considered as if they had no effect on each other. Later on, several extensions to the Delphi method were developed to address this problem, such as cross impact analysis, that takes into consideration the possibility that the occurrence of one event may change probabilities of other events covered in the survey. Still the Delphi method can be used most successfully in forecasting single scalar indicators.

===Delphi vs. prediction markets===
Delphi has characteristics similar to prediction markets as both are structured approaches that aggregate diverse opinions from groups. Yet, there are differences that may be decisive for their relative applicability for different problems.

Some advantages of prediction markets derive from the possibility to provide incentives for participation.
# They can motivate people to participate over a long period of time and to reveal their true beliefs.
# They aggregate information automatically and instantly incorporate new information in the forecast.
# Participants do not have to be selected and recruited manually by a facilitator. They themselves decide whether to participate if they think their private information is not yet incorporated in the forecast.

Delphi seems to have these advantages over prediction markets:
# Participants reveal their reasoning
# It is easier to maintain confidentiality
# Potentially quicker forecasts if experts are readily available.
# Delphi is applicable in situations where the bets involved might affect the value of the currency used in bets (e.g. a bet on the collapse of the dollar made in dollars might have distorted odds).

More recent research has also focused on combining both, the Delphi technique and prediction markets. More specifically, in a research study at Deutsche Börse elements of the Delphi method had been integrated into a prediction market.
