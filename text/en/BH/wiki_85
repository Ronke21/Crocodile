<text>Thomas Henderson FRSE FRS FRAS (28 December 1798 – 23 November 1844) was a Scottish astronomer and mathematician noted for being the first person to measure the distance to Alpha Centauri, the major component of the nearest stellar system to Earth, the first to determine the parallax of a fixed star, and for being the first Astronomer Royal for Scotland.

== Early life ==
Born in Dundee, he was educated at the High School of Dundee, after which he trained as a lawyer, working his way up through the profession as an assistant to a variety of nobles. However, his major hobbies were astronomy and mathematics, and after coming up with a new method for using lunar occultation to measure longitude he came to the attention of Thomas Young, superintendent of the Royal Navy&#x27;s &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot;. Young helped the young Henderson enter the larger world of astronomical science, and on his death a posthumous letter recommended to the Admiralty that Henderson take his place.

== Career ==
=== Africa ===
Henderson was passed over for that position, but the recommendation was enough to get him a position at the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. There he made a considerable number of stellar observations between April 1832 and May 1833, including those for which he is remembered today. It was pointed out to him by Manuel John Johnson of the East India Company&#x27;s observatory on Saint Helena that the bright southern star Alpha Centauri had a large proper motion, and Henderson concluded that it might be relatively close.

The 1830s version of the &quot;space race&quot; was to be the first person to measure the distance to a star using parallax, a task which is easier the closer the star. Henderson was thus in a good position to be this person. After retiring back to the United Kingdom due to bad health, he began analysing his measurements and eventually came to the conclusion that Alpha Centauri was just slightly less than one parsec away, 3.25 light years. This figure is reasonably accurate, being 25.6% too small.

Henderson did not immediately publish his results, however (there had been previous, discredited attempts to claim a measurement of stellar parallax), and eventually he was beaten to the punch by Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, who published a parallax of 10.3 light years (9.6% too small) for 61 Cygni in 1838. Henderson published his results in 1839, but was relegated to second place because of his lack of confidence. He later published confirming observations by Thomas Maclear. Alpha Centauri remained the nearest known star until the discovery of Proxima Centauri in 1915 by Robert T. A. Innes.

=== Scotland ===

In the meantime, his measurement work at the Cape had led him to be appointed the first Astronomer Royal for Scotland in 1834. The vacant chair of astronomy at the University of Edinburgh was given to him on the advice of Prime Minister Lord Melbourne. From 1834 he worked at the City Observatory (then called the Calton Hill Observatory) in Edinburgh until his death. In April, 1840 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Henderson became a member or fellow of several distinguished societies, including the Royal Astronomical Society (1832) and the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1834).

== Personal life and death ==

He married Alexander Adie&#x27;s daughter Janet Mary Adie (1808–1842) in 1836 and had one daughter, Janet Mary Jane Henderson (1842–1893) who is buried in the Grange Cemetery.

He died at home 1 Hillside Crescent in Edinburgh on 23 November 1844 and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. The grave may be either in the grave of Alexander Adie or in a grave marked by the stone &quot;to his memory&quot;. His name is not recorded on the Adie grave; Adie himself died 14 years after Henderson.

==Recognition==

A blue plaque is installed on his house at 1 Hillside Crescent. It refers to him as &quot;Thomas J. A. Henderson&quot;, similar to middle names wrongly added to Wikipedia around 2007.

A larger memorial (naming him &quot;Thomas Henderson&quot;) is incorporated in the external wall of the City Observatory.

Asteroid 3077 Henderson is named in his honour.

<text>The National Religious Party (, &quot;Miflaga Datit Leumit&quot;), commonly known in Israel by its Hebrew abbreviation Mafdal (), was an Israeli political party representing the interests of the Israeli settlers and religious Zionist movement.

Formed in 1956, at the time of its dissolution in 2008, it was the second-oldest surviving party in the country after Agudat Yisrael, and was part of every government coalition until 1992. Originally a pragmatic centrist party in its first two decades of existence, it gradually leaned rightward in the following years, particularly becoming increasingly associated with Israeli settlers. Towards the end of its existence, it became part of a far-right political alliance centered around the National Union.

The 2006 elections saw the party slump to just three seats, the worst electoral performance in its history. In November 2008, party members voted to disband the party in order to join the new Jewish Home party created by a merger of the NRP and most of the National Union factions. However, most of the National Union left the merger shortly after its implementation.

== Ideological background ==
The religious Zionist movement is an Orthodox Jewish faction within the broader Zionist movement, combining a belief in the importance of establishing a Jewish state in the Land of Israel following a religious way of life, in contrast to both secular Zionists and ultra-Orthodox Jewry. The spiritual and ideological founder of the Religious Zionist movement was the Ashkenazi rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, who urged young religious Jews to settle in Israel and called upon the secular Labor Zionists to pay more attention to Judaism. Rabbi Kook saw Zionism as part of a divine scheme that would result in resettling the Jewish people in the Holy Land, and, ultimately, the coming of the Jewish Messiah.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The National Religious Party (NRP) was created by the merger of two parties - Mizrachi and Hapoel HaMizrachi - in 1956. The two parties had run for the 1955 election on a joint list under the name of the &quot;National Religious Front&quot;. Even after the formation of the NRP as a single party, its lists used the National Religious Front name up to the 1992 election, with the NRP&#x27;s own name only debuting on the ballot in 1988. The founders of the party were Yosef Burg and Haim-Moshe Shapira (both from Hapoel HaMizrachi), who focused their activity mainly on the status of Judaism within the framework of Israeli society. Throughout the NRP&#x27;s existence, it attempted to preserve the relevance of Judaism on issues such as Israeli personal status laws, education, culture, and municipal issues such as prohibitions on the selling of non-Kosher food (in prescribed areas, and occasionally, throughout a given municipality), and prohibiting transportation and public activities on Shabbat.

The NRP operated a trade union (under the same name as the old workers&#x27; party, Hapoel HaMizrachi), a newspaper (HaTzofe), and a youth movement (Bnei Akiva). Only the youth movement still exists today.

=== Post–Six-Day War ===
The seeds of change were sown in 1967, when Israel&#x27;s victory in the Six-Day War spawned messianic trends among religious Israeli Jews that resulted in many members of the NRP moving further right. After Israel gained control of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, Haim Moshe Shapira, the leader of the NRP and member of the Israel cabinet, believed that Israel should aggressively pursue peace talks with Arab states and supported immediate negotiations with Jordan over the status of holy sites in Jerusalem. However, the party became internally divided around the annexation of the occupied territories. Some factions favored withdrawing from the occupied territories in the event of a peace agreement, while others argued that it was a religious obligation to annex the territories.

Around 1969, a new generation arose in the NRP, led by Zevulun Hammer and Yehuda Ben-Meir, called &quot;the youth&quot;, demanding that the party pay more attention to socio-economic issues in addition to its concerns about Judaism and the modern state.

From its inception, the NRP maintained an almost constant number of 12 members of the Israeli Knesset. In 1981, it shrank to 6 members. The reasons were diverse: an overall reduction in its natural voting population; the political moderation of many Orthodox Jews; its turn towards the right-wing; the growing importance of the right-left schism in Israeli politics; and the rise of Orthodox Sephardic parties such as Tami and later Shas.

The Gesher – Zionist Religious Centre (, &quot;Gesher – Merkaz Tzioni Dati&quot;) faction was formed on 29 May 1984, during the 10th Knesset, when two MKs, Yehuda Ben-Meir and Zevulun Hammer, broke away from the NRP. Both were prominent members of the party, with Hammer serving as Minister of Education, Culture and Sport and Ben-Meir being Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. The faction took the &quot;Gesher&quot; part of its name from the youth faction within the NRP. The faction did not last long, as the two returned to the NRP on 12 June. Ben-Meir later left the NRP again to be one of the founding members of the left-wing religious party Meimad, whilst Hammer went on to become leader of the NRP.

The party was unique in that it participated in all the governments of Israel until 1992. During this period, it was a centrist party, interested mainly in religious matters and impervious to the left–right divisions of the Israeli public. The long-time cooperation between the Israeli Labor Party and the NRP is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Historic League&quot; (הברית ההיסטורית).

=== 2003 government ===
The NRP was a member of the 2003 government led by Ariel Sharon, and had two ministers in the cabinet. Effi Eitam was the Minister of Housing, and Zevulun Orlev was the Minister of Labor and Welfare. Yitzhak Levy was a deputy minister responsible for the Ministry of Religious Affairs until it was dismantled.

The party helped form the previous government&#x27;s coalition, together with the Likud, Shinui, and the National Union, which was based on the following principles:
* A hard-line policy against Palestinian terrorism and increasing use of the military for counter-terror operations.
* Supporting the Road Map for Peace, but with the reservation that the Palestinians should stop terrorism and elect a democratic prime minister.
* Supporting the Israeli West Bank barrier, on condition that it will include the major settlement blocks in the West Bank.
* Finding a solution for those people who cannot marry according to Jewish law by creating something similar to a civil marriage.
* Drafting Haredi men for military service.
* Retaining the Jewish character of the state of Israel.
* Obligating the Shinui party not to act unilaterally in matters of state and religion, and that they would discuss the issues with the NRP and reach a compromise.

The party subsequently left the government and went into opposition.

=== Disengagement plan ===
Sharon&#x27;s disengagement plan caused great controversy within the party. Sharon dismissed two cabinet ministers from the National Union to achieve a majority for approving the plan in his government. The NRP declared that it was resisting the plan and any removal of Jews living in Gush Katif (in the Gaza Strip). The party, together with the Likud right-wing, failed to stop the disengagement plan.

Eventually, Effi Eitam and Yitzhak Levi resigned from the government. However, the four other Knesset Members of the NRP supported Orlev&#x27;s stand that the party should remain in the coalition and thwart the disengagement plan from the inside.

The party&#x27;s Knesset faction split into two:
# The Opposition (Eitam and Rabbi Levi) - who had resisted Sharon&#x27;s plan and saw themselves uncommitted to the coalition and government.
# The Coalition (Orlev, Yahalom, Finkelstein) - had voted to stay in the coalition, but vowed to quit when a Jewish settlement was dismantled.
* Nisan Slomianski did not take a clear position, compromising between the two factions.

On 13 September 2004, the party&#x27;s &quot;center&quot; (a forum of all party members with voting rights) voted on a choice between Effi Eitam&#x27;s proposal of immediately resigning from the government and Zevulon Orlev&#x27;s proposal to leave the government only when it approved an actual removal of settlements. Eitam and Orlev agreed that the center&#x27;s decision would be binding. The center supported Orlev&#x27;s proposal by 65%–35%. The proposal stated that the party would stay in the government on condition that the government would hold a general referendum (משאל עם, &quot;Meshal Am&quot;) regarding the removal of the Israeli settlements, which would require a special majority, before the issue could be brought to a decision in the Knesset. If such a referendum would not be held, or if the government would approve a &quot;de facto&quot; removal of Israeli settlements, the party would resign from the government.

It was decided that the NRP would resign from the government if:
* The government approved the dismantling of Israeli settlements.
* The Knesset passed laws of evacuation and compensation.
* The Labor Party joined the government and the coalition.
* A general referendum on the disengagement would not be held.

On 9 November 2004, after Ariel Sharon declined the NRP&#x27;s demand to hold a national referendum regarding the disengagement, Zevulun Orlev and the party resigned from the coalition and the government, vowing to pursue general elections in an effort to replace Sharon with a right-wing prime minister. After their resignation, Sharon had a minority coalition of 56 Knesset members out of 120.

=== The split ===
On 14 February 2005, Eitam was suspended from the party chairmanship by the NRP&#x27;s internal court, after he left the government against the center decision. Angered at the suspension, Eitam and Itzhak Levi announced that they had officially split from the NRP to form a new party, the Renewed Religious National Zionist Party (now renamed Ahi, on 23 February. The new party became part of the National Union, an alliance of Moledet and Tkuma - itself a former right-wing faction of the NRP. At the time, the National Union also included the Russian-secular Yisrael Beiteinu party, though they chose to run alone in the 2006 elections.

=== Alliance with the National Union ===
Due to their weakening, the NRP eventually decided to run on a joint list with the National Union for the 2006 election, which included Eitam and Levy on its list. The joint list went under the title of &quot;National Union – NRP&quot; (Hebrew: האיחוד הלאומי-מפדל, &quot;HaIhud HaLeumi – Mafdal&quot;) and won nine seats, of which the NRP were awarded three.

On 3 November 2008, the party announced a merger with the National Union, Tkuma, and Moledet to form a new right-wing party, later named The Jewish Home. Zevulun Orlev said it would be &quot;unity by the Zionist religious camp. Anyone can submit his candidacy. There is no advantage whatsoever to current Knesset members.&quot; On 18 November, NRP members voted to disband the party to join the new right-wing party created by a merger of the NRP and most of the National Union factions.

== Ideology ==
=== Main principles ===
The NRP was a Zionist party and stated that Israel was a &quot;Jewish democratic state&quot;. The party&#x27;s stated main goals were to contribute as much as it could to the state of Israel, and to influence its character to be more Jewish, as well as fighting for the protection of Israel and maintaining Israel&#x27;s security.

&quot;The core belief &quot; the Land of Israel for the People of Israel according to the Torah of Israel&quot; commits the NRP to doing everything possible to further the security and integrity of the Land of Israel. The NRP aspires to influence policy from &quot;within the government&quot;, and thus continue to safeguard Eretz Israel.&quot;

Unlike the Kach party, the NRP did not promote the notion of &quot;Medinat Halacha&quot; (Halachic state), a theocracy run according to Jewish law. This idea was promoted by Meir Kahane. The party wanted to retain Israel&#x27;s democratic chaos while improving the Israeli people. It aspired to encourage Jews to become better by acting as role models and teaching Judaism to other Israelis by example. The NRP demands that most Haredi men complete three years of mandatory military service.

The NRP emphasised national unity, and vowed to work as a bridge between the different parts of Israeli society.

&quot;Religious and secular, Sephardim and Askenazim, right and left, old-timers and new immigrants  - we are all one people. The NRP works toward national unity, absorption of immigration, and bringing people together from all sectors of the population. Without hatred and coercion. Gently, pleasantly, and with a smile.&quot;

They called this principle &quot;Ahavat Israel&quot; (אהבת ישראל, &quot;Love of Israel&quot;).

The party was the patron of most of the national religious schools (חינוך ממלכתי-דתי), which teach both Judaism and general mandatory educational subjects such as mathematics, English, literature, physics, biology, etc. It sponsored some pre-military schools that provide higher education to future IDF officers and commanders. Besides funding and patronizing national religious schools, it also supported Yeshiva schools and Beit Midrash schools, places dedicated solely to Torah study. They also ran &quot;Yeshivot Hesder&quot;, an idea developed by Rav Yehuda Amital in which religious soldiers combine combat military service with learning Torah. The Hesder program is typically five years.

&quot;The NRP actively promotes Torah in Israel and strengthens national religious institutions: Zionist rabbinical training institutes, Zionist Kollels, Yeshivot gevohot, Hesder Yeshivot, Yeshiva high schools, and more. The NRP encourages Zionist rabbis to take on active roles as teachers in Yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders in cities and neighborhoods.&quot;

The party believes that the land of Israel is holy and belongs to the Jews based on God&#x27;s promise to Abraham, and later to Isaac and Jacob. They believe it is God&#x27;s will to settle all the land of Israel and nurture it. This principle has great impact on NRP policy toward the West Bank and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

===Religion and state===
The NRP&#x27;s policy was that Israel ought to retain its special Jewish character and retain a vague commitment to Judaism.

The party argued that affairs of personal status, (such as marriage, divorces, and burial), should be kept under the authority of Israel&#x27;s rabbis (or other religious clerics for non-Jews).

The NRP claimed that the Jewish state shows respect for the Jewish religion by observing the Sabbath and serving Kosher food in its institutions and organizations (as it applies to the IDF, public transportation, the Israeli police, and governmental companies.)

The party, along with the other Orthodox political parties in Israel, wanted entrenchment into Israeli law so that converts to Judaism who wish to immigrate to Israel under the Law of Return can only be accepted if their conversions were conducted according to strict Orthodox standards. This was a controversial position, as some secular claim that it would undermine Israel&#x27;s connections with worldwide, and especially American, Jews. (See Who is a Jew? for more information.)

Regarding conversions to Judaism performed within Israel, the NRP found itself on the same side of the debate as the secular, and opposed to the views of the Haredi parties, particularly Shas. The party advocated that the Israeli Chief Rabbinate must act to ease the procedures for anyone who wants to convert, following the Neeman Committee (ועדת נאמן) recommendations. It also called for the restoration of the &quot;nationality&quot; (לאום &quot;Leom&quot;) clause on the Israeli identification card. Both issues are connected to public debates about Russian immigrants who are within the rubric not being Jews according to Jewish law.

The issue of conscripting yeshiva students was a sensitive issue in the party&#x27;s rhetoric. Historically, the NRP initiated the regulations allowing yeshiva students to avoid military service, and supported that position over a long time. This came into conflict with the party&#x27;s ideology and its supporters as the party moved towards the center, and as the number of such students rose sharply leading to allegations that many were not really students. In the 2000s, the NRP explicitly stated that participation in the Israeli army was a &quot;Mitzvah&quot; and a moral obligation, and stressed that its &quot;finest youth... serve in the elite commando and combat units in the IDF&quot;.

===The Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the settlements===
The NRP&#x27;s views on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict can be summarized as:
* There will only be one state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea—the State of Israel. No independent national Arab entity (such as a putative Palestinian state) will exist within these borders
* No part of Israel will be given over to a foreign government or authority.

However, the party did agree to giving the Palestinian Arabs self-governing autonomy, subject to Israel&#x27;s authority only in matters of security and foreign affairs (such as in borders and diplomacy), without the dismantling of the Jewish settlements.

The NRP reacted to the Second Intifada by demanding a harsh military response by Israel to &quot;root out the terror infrastructure&quot;. It also called for disbanding the Palestinian Authority and the deportation of the PLO back to Tunisia. The party believed that Israel could stop Palestinian violence through the use of military force.

The NRP used mostly religious discourse to justify these positions. They stressed that the West Bank were parts of the ancient kingdom of Israel and kingdom of Judah, and hence, rightfully belong to modern Israel. Furthermore, the party viewed the Jewish settlements as an upholding of the mitzvah of settling the land of Israel. Many of its supporters and parliament members were settlers.

===Social issues and welfare===
The NRP did not adhere to an economic ideology (such as Marxism or Capitalism). However, the party believed that Israeli society and the state of Israel should support the poor and the needy, derived from the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. The party&#x27;s most notable figure in this respect was Zevulun Orlev, (who served as Minister of Labor and Social Welfare). However, this issue was not high on the party&#x27;s agenda or rhetoric.

===Criticism===
Some critics of the NRP said that it was too focused on the Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and that they neglected other issues such as education, social responsibility, and &quot;Ahavat Israel&quot; (&quot;Love of Israel&quot; i. e., of other Jews).

Left-wing critics insisted that the party&#x27;s stubbornness about keeping the settlements was an &quot;obstacle to peace&quot;, while right-wing critics said the NRP did not pressure the Israeli government enough to use more military force against Palestinian terrorism.

Critics from religious parties such as Shas and Agudat Israel scorned the NRP for having been in the governing coalition with an ultra-secular party like Shinui (which was often described as &quot;anti-religious&quot;), and for not doing enough to keep the Jewish character of Israel; in one example, the party displayed little, if any, resistance or dismay, against former Internal Minister Avraham Poraz&#x27;s decision not to enforce the prohibition of selling bread during Passover (when eating bread is a prohibition of Chametz according to Orthodox Judaism).

==Members and supporters==
===Supporters===
NRP supporters were mainly Zionists, who are Orthodox Jews, in some ways Modern Orthodox.

:&quot;Wherever you look, you see them. Members of the national religious community, with the knitted kippot on their heads. In academia, in economic life, in the educational system, in high tech, medicine, the courts, the IDF, even in the media. Each one of them doing their bit of &quot;kiddush HaShem&quot; (sanctifying God) in daily endeavors.&quot;

Male religious Zionists can be recognized by their colorful hand-knitted kippah (כיפה, &quot;yarmulka&quot; or &quot;skull cap&quot;), hence their nickname: הכיפות הסרוגות (&quot;Ha-Kippot Ha-Srugot&quot;, lit. &quot;The Knitted Yarmulkas&quot;).

<text>The James Ossuary is a 1st-century limestone box that was used for containing the bones of the dead. An Aramaic inscription meaning &quot;Jacob (James), son of Joseph, brother of Yeshua&quot; is cut into one side of the box. The ossuary attracted scholarly attention due to its apparent association with the Christian holy family.

The existence of the ossuary was announced at an October 21, 2002, Washington press conference co-hosted by the Discovery Channel and the Biblical Archaeology Society. The owner of the ossuary is Oded Golan, an Israeli engineer and antiquities collector. The inscription was initially translated by André Lemaire, a Semitic epigrapher, whose article claiming that the ossuary and its inscription were authentic was published in the November/December 2002 issue of &quot;Biblical Archaeology Review&quot;.

In 2003, the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) argued that the inscriptions were forged at a much later date. In December 2004, Oded Golan was charged with 44 counts of forgery, fraud, and deception, including forgery of the Ossuary inscription. However, in an external expert report, dated September 2005, Wolfgang E. Krumbein&#x27;s conclusions contradicted those of the IAA, stating: &quot;Our preliminary investigations cannot prove the authenticity of the three objects beyond any doubt. Doubtlessly the patina is continuous in many places throughout surface and lettering grooves in the case of ossuary and tablet. On the other hand a proof of forgery is not given by the experts nominated by the IAA.&quot;. The trial lasted seven years before Judge Aharon Farkash came to a verdict. On March 14, 2012, Golan was acquitted of the forgery charges but convicted of illegal trading in antiquities. The judge said this acquittal &quot;does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago&quot;. The ossuary was returned to Golan, who put it on public display.

==Significance==
An ossuary is a stone (usually limestone) depository for storing bones of the dead, considered a luxury for the elite. The dead would lie on a loculus in a tomb for a year of decomposition, and then the remains would be collected and placed in an ossuary. Depending on the wealth and taste of the family, the box would sometimes be inscribed with decorations or the name of the deceased. The James Ossuary measures , which is slightly smaller than average compared to other ossuaries of the time. Owner Oded Golan said that, if the inscription on the James Ossuary is genuine, it may indicate that the ossuary was that of James the Just, the brother of Jesus, the founder of Christianity.

Professor Camil Fuchs of Tel Aviv University stated that, other than the James Ossuary, there has so far only been one found, amongst thousands of ossuaries, that contains a reference to a brother, concluding that &quot;there is little doubt that this [naming a brother or son] was done only when there was a very meaningful reason to refer to a family member of the deceased, usually due to his importance and fame.&quot; He produced a statistical analysis of the occurrence of these three names in ancient Jerusalem and projected that there would only have been 1.71 people named James, with a father named Joseph and a brother named Jesus, expected to be living in Jerusalem around the time at which the ossuary was produced.

==Announcement and exhibition==
The existence of the James Ossuary was announced at a press conference in Washington, D.C., on October 21, 2002. It was organized by Hershel Shanks, founder of the Biblical Archaeology Society. He presented it as the first direct archaeological link to the historical Jesus.

Shanks also announced that the ossuary would be featured at an exhibit at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario, opening the following month. The opening was to coincide with meetings of scholarly groups such as the Society of Biblical Literature and American Academy of Religion that were to take place in the city in November.

==Scholarly analysis==
The James Ossuary came from the Silwan area in the Kidron Valley, southeast of the Temple Mount. The bones originally inside the ossuary had been discarded, which is the case in nearly all ossuaries not discovered by archaeologists. The first-century origin of the ossuary is not in question, since the only time Jews buried in that fashion was from approximately 20 BC to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. The dispute centres on the date of origin of the inscription.

According to André Lemaire, the Parisian epigrapher initially invited by antiquities dealer Oded Golan to view the ossuary in Golan&#x27;s apartment, the cursive Aramaic script is consistent with first-century lettering. He determined that the inscription was not incised with modern tools, as it contains no chemical elements not available in the ancient world. The first part of the inscription, &quot;James son of Joseph&quot;, seems more deeply incised than the latter &quot;brother of Jesus&quot;. This may be due to the inscription being made at a different time, or due to differences in the hardness of the limestone.

The fragile condition of the ossuary attests to its antiquity. The Israel Geological Survey submitted the ossuary to a variety of scientific tests, which determined that the limestone of the ossuary had a patina or sheen consistent with being in a cave for many centuries. The same type of patina covers the incised lettering of the inscription as the rest of the surface. It is claimed that, if the inscription were recent, this would not be the case.

On June 18, 2003, the Israeli Antiquities Authority published a report, based on their analysis of the patina, which concluded that the inscription is a modern forgery. Specifically, it claimed that the inscription was added in modern times and made to look old by addition of a chalk solution. In 2006, Wolfgang Elisabeth Krumbein, a world-renowned expert in stone patinas, called by the defense counsel, analyzed the ossuary and concluded that &quot;the inscription is ancient and most of the original patina has been removed (by cleaning or use of sharp implement)&quot;. He further noted in his report, &quot;any forgery of three very distinct types of patina, if ever possible, requires the development of ultra-advanced techniques, in-depth knowledge and extensive collaboration of a large number of experts from various fields&quot;. According to his analysis, the patina inside the inscription took at least 50 years to form; thus, if it is a forgery, then it was forged more than 50 years ago.

In 2004, an analysis of the ossuary&#x27;s petrography and oxygen isotopic composition was conducted by Avner Ayalon, Miryam Bar-Matthews and Yuval Goren. They compared the &quot;δ&quot;18O values of the letters&#x27; patina from the James Ossuary with the patina sampled from the uninscribed surfaces of the same item (&quot;surface patina&quot;), and with the surface and letters&#x27; patinas from legally excavated ossuaries from Jerusalem. Their study undermined the authenticity claim of the ossuary. However, Dr James Harrell, professor of Archaeological Geology at the University of Toledo, provided an explanation for this &quot;δ&quot;18O discrepancy. He suggested that a cleanser, which antiquities dealers and collectors often use to clean the artifacts to increase value, may have been the source of the low &quot;δ&quot;18O readings. He tested the most popular cleanser sold in Israel and confirmed that the &quot;δ&quot;18O value of the cleanser was consistent with the &quot;δ&quot;18O value of the patina in the inscription.

A later study with a different isotope found that the &quot;δ&quot;13C values of the surface patina and the inscription patina were almost identical.

In 2007, Finnish theologian Matti Myllykoski (Arto Matti Tuomas Myllykoski) summarised the current position thus: &quot;The authenticity and significance of the ossuary has been defended by Shanks (2003), while some scholars—relying on convincing evidence, to say the least—strongly suspect that it is a modern forgery.&quot;

In 2013, an archaeometric analysis by Amnon Rosenfeld, Howard Randall Feldman and Wolfgang Elisabeth Krumbein strengthened the authenticity contention of the ossuary. It found that patina on the ossuary surface matched that in the engravings, and that microfossils in the inscription seemed naturally deposited.

==Israeli investigation==
Limor Livnat, Israeli Minister of Culture, mandated the work of a scientific commission to study the suspicious finds. IAA began an investigation into the affair. The James Ossuary was authentic—albeit unusual in shape—but they concluded that the inscription was likely a forgery.

However, in an external expert report, dated September 2005, Wolfgang E. Krumbein entered the controversy. He concluded that &quot;Our preliminary investigations cannot prove the authenticity of the three objects beyond any doubt. Doubtlessly the patina is continuous in many places throughout surface and lettering grooves in the case of ossuary and tablet. On the other hand a proof of forgery is not given by the experts nominated by the IAA.&quot;

Edward John Keall, the Senior Curator at the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM), Near Eastern &amp; Asian Civilizations Department, continues to argue for the ossuary&#x27;s authenticity, saying &quot;the ROM has always been open to questioning the ossuary&#x27;s authenticity, but so far no definitive proof of forgery has yet been presented, in spite of the current claims being made.&quot;

The &quot;Biblical Archaeology Review&quot; also continued to defend the ossuary. In articles in the February 2005 issues, several paleographic experts argue that the James Ossuary is authentic and should be examined by specialists outside of Israel. Another article claims the cleaning of the James Ossuary before it was examined may have caused the problem with the patina. On June 13, 2012, a &quot;Biblical Archaeology Review&quot; press release announced the first major post-trial analysis of the ossuary, discussing the plausibility of its authenticity and using statistical analysis of ancient names to suggest that in contemporary Jerusalem, there would be 1.71 people named James with a father Joseph and a brother named Jesus.

==Trial of Oded Golan==
Oded Golan claimed publicly to believe his finds were genuine. Hershel Shanks declared that he did not believe the evidence of forgery and launched a personal complaint against IAA director Shuka Dorfman. Lemaire supported his original assessment when Frank Cross regretted Shanks&#x27; attitude. The Royal Ontario Museum, in its statement about Oded Golan&#x27;s arrest and the validity of the so-called James Ossuary stated, &quot;There is always a question of authenticity when objects do not come from a controlled archaeological excavation, as is the case with the James Ossuary.&quot; However, the museum&#x27;s decision to rush the ossuary into an exhibition was criticized by scholars.

Meyers called the ROM &quot;reckless&quot;, and Joe Zias said, &quot;They saw the opportunity to make a fast buck and they did it.&quot; The Israel Antiquities Authority wants to limit the trade in Bible-era artifacts, which they believe encourages grave robbers, who smuggle the choicest finds out of the country.

On December 29, 2004, the Israeli Justice Ministry charged Golan, three other Israelis, and one Palestinian, with running a forgery ring that had been operating for more than twenty years. Golan was indicted in an Israeli court along with his three co-defendants: Robert Deutsch, an epigraphy expert who has given lectures at the University of Haifa; collector Shlomo Cohen; and antiquities dealer Faiz al-Amaleh. They were accused of manufacturing numerous artifacts, including an Ivory pomegranate which had previously been generally accepted as the only proven relic from the Temple of King Solomon. Golan denied the charges.

In February 2007, at Golan&#x27;s trial, the defense produced photographs taken in Golan&#x27;s home that were dated to 1976. In these photographs, the ossuary is shown on a shelf. In an enlargement, the whole inscription can be seen. The photographs were printed on 1970s photographic paper and stamped March 1976. The photo was examined by Gerald Richard, a former FBI agent and an expert for the defense. Richard testified that nothing about the photographs suggested that they were produced other than in 1976 as the stamps and paper indicated. These photographs undermined the prosecution&#x27;s theory that the ossuary was a recent forgery by Golan intended to be sold for profit. Golan&#x27;s attorney, Lior Beringer argued, &quot;The prosecution claims that Golan forged the inscription after the beginning of 2000, however, there is a detailed report from an FBI photo lab that states that the inscription existed at least since the 70s. It is unreasonable that someone would forge an inscription like this in the 70s and suddenly decide to come out with it in 2002.&quot; However, it would also be necessary for some time to pass for a forgery to acquire the characteristics of an authentic patina. Later under oath, the government&#x27;s chief scientific witness, Professor Yuval Goren of Tel Aviv University admitted on cross-examination that there was original ancient patina in the word &quot;Jesus.&quot;

Two paleographers, André Lemaire of the Sorbonne and Ada Yardeni of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, pronounced it as authentic in the trial. No paleographer of repute has challenged their analysis. In fact, Yardeni, who is considered an expert in the field, testified that the inscription is no doubt of ancient origin inscribed by a single individual, and stated, &quot;If this is a forgery, I quit.&quot; By 2009, many of the world&#x27;s top archaeological experts had testified for both the prosecution and defense. Judge Aharon Farkash, who has a degree in archaeology, indicated difficulty in making a judgment regarding the objects&#x27; authenticity if the professors could not agree amongst themselves. In the second week of October 2010, Farkash retired to consider his verdict. Epigrapher Rochelle Altman, who is considered top-notch, has repeatedly called the second half of the inscription a forgery.

On March 14, 2012, Farkash stated &quot;that there is no evidence that any of the major artifacts were forged [by Golan], and the prosecution failed to prove their accusations beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;. He was particularly scathing about tests carried out by the Israel police forensics laboratory that he said had probably contaminated the ossuary, making it impossible to carry out further scientific tests on the inscription. However, the judge explicitly declined to rule on the authenticity of the objects, underlining that the acquittal &quot;does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago&quot; and that “[T]here is nothing in these findings which necessarily proves that the items were authentic”.

On May 30, 2012, Oded Golan was fined 30,000 shekels and sentenced to one month in jail for minor non-forgery charges related to the trial. As he had already served time incarcerated at the start of the case, he did not have to serve any further time in prison.

Following Golan&#x27;s acquittal, the Israeli Antiquities Authority released a statement in which, while respecting the court&#x27;s verdict, it also underlined that &quot;the court had to decide professional issues in the field of archaeology, which are not frequently heard in a court of law. Because a person’s guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal trial, Golan was acquitted. However, the judge did emphasize that it was not possible to determine that the finds presented in the trial – including the ossuary and the &#x27;Jehoash inscription&#x27; – are not forgeries.&quot;

==Discovery Channel documentaries==

On February 26, 2007, a news conference was held at the New York Public Library by director James Cameron and Simcha Jacobovici to discuss their documentary &quot;The Lost Tomb of Jesus&quot;, which discusses the 1980 finding of the Talpiot Tomb, which they claim is in fact Jesus&#x27; family tomb. In the film, they also suggest that the so-called James ossuary is actually the &quot;missing link&quot; from the tomb. At the original discovery of the Talpiot Tomb, there were ten ossuaries, but one has since been lost. Jacobovici suggests the James Ossuary could be the missing one. According to the film, &quot;recent tests conducted at the CSI Suffolk Crime lab in New York demonstrate that the patina (a chemical film encrustation on the box) from the James ossuary matches the patina from the other ossuaries in the Talpiot tomb.&quot;

Early Christianity scholar R. Joseph Hoffmann, chair of the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion charges that the film &quot;is all about bad assumptions,&quot; beginning with the assumption that the boxes contain Jesus of Nazareth and his family. From his view as a historian specializing in the social history of earliest Christianity, he found it &quot;amazing how evidence falls into place when you begin with the conclusion—and a hammer.&quot;

When interviewed about the upcoming documentary, Amos Kloner, who oversaw the original archaeological dig of this tomb in 1980 said:

: &quot;It makes a great story for a TV film, but it&#x27;s completely impossible. It&#x27;s nonsense.&quot;

&quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that the archaeologist who personally numbered the ossuaries dismissed any potential connection:

: &quot;Simcha [Jacobovici] has no credibility whatsoever,&quot; says Joe Zias, who was the curator for anthropology and archeology at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem from 1972 to 1997 and personally numbered the Talpiot ossuaries. &quot;He&#x27;s pimping off the Bible … He got this guy Cameron, who made &quot;Titanic&quot; or something like that—what does this guy know about archeology? I am an archeologist, but if I were to write a book about brain surgery, you would say, &#x27;Who is this guy?&#x27; People want signs and wonders. Projects like these make a mockery of the archeological profession.&quot;

Pfann also thinks the inscription read as &quot;Jesus&quot; has been misread and suggests that the name &quot;Hanun&quot; might be a more accurate rendering.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that William G. Dever (mentioned above as excavating ancient sites in Israel for 50 years) offered the following:

: &quot;I&#x27;ve known about these ossuaries for many years and so have many other archaeologists, and none of us thought it was much of a story, because these are rather common Jewish names from that period. It&#x27;s a publicity stunt, and it will make these guys very rich, and it will upset millions of innocent people because they don&#x27;t know enough to separate fact from fiction.&quot;

Ben Witherington III of Asbury Theological Seminary pointed out some other circumstantial problems with linking this tomb to Jesus&#x27; family:

* &quot;So far as we can tell, the earliest followers of Jesus never called Jesus &#x27;son of Joseph&#x27;. It was outsiders who mistakenly called him that.&quot;
* &quot;The ancestral home of Joseph was Bethlehem, and his adult home was Nazareth. The family was still in Nazareth after he [Joseph] was apparently dead and gone. Why in the world would he be buried (alone at this point) in Jerusalem?&quot;
* &quot;One of the ossuaries has the name Jude son of Jesus. We have no historical evidence of such a son of Jesus, indeed we have no historical evidence he was ever married.&quot;
* &quot;The Mary ossuaries (there are two) do not mention anyone from Migdal. It simply has the name Mary—and that&#x27;s about the most common of all ancient Jewish female names.&quot;
* &quot;We have names like Matthew on another ossuary, which don&#x27;t match up with the list of [Jesus&#x27;s] brothers&#x27; names.&quot;

The Archaeological Institute of America has published online their own criticism of the &quot;Jesus tomb&quot; claim:&quot;The identification of the Talpiyot tomb as the tomb of Jesus and his family is based on a string of problematic and unsubstantiated claims [...] [It] contradicts the canonical Gospel accounts of the death and burial of Jesus and the earliest Christian traditions about Jesus. This claim is also inconsistent with all of the available information—historical and archaeological—about how Jews in the time of Jesus buried their dead, and specifically the evidence we have about poor, non-Judean families like that of Jesus. It is a sensationalistic claim without any scientific basis or support.&quot;Lawrence E. Stager, the Dorot professor of archaeology of Israel at Harvard, said the documentary was &quot;exploiting the whole trend that caught on with &quot;The Da Vinci Code.&quot; One of the problems is there are so many biblically illiterate people around the world that they don&#x27;t know what is real judicious assessment and what is what some of us in the field call &#x27;fantastic archaeology.&#x27;&quot;

During Ted Koppel&#x27;s critique, &quot;The Lost Tomb of Jesus: A Critical Look&quot;, Koppel stated he had denials from three people whom Simcha Jacobovici had misquoted in the documentary.
# Koppel had a written denial from the forensic archaeologist asserting that he had not concluded that the remains of Jesus and Miriamne showed they were husband and wife.
# Koppel had a written denial from the Suffolk Crime Lab Director asserting that he had not stated the James ossuary patina &quot;matched&quot; that of the Jesus ossuary. 
# Koppel had a verbal denial from Professor Amos Kloner, the archaeologist who had supervised the initial 1980 dig of the tomb, with whom he spoke on March 4, 2007, asserting that the ossuary that later turned up missing from the tomb could not have been what is now known as the James ossuary because the ossuary he had seen and photographed and catalogued in 1980 had been totally unmarked, whereas the James ossuary is marked with the name of James and a rosette.

<doc id="336338" wikidata="Q1246291" url="?curid=336338" title="Moses Wilhelm Shapira">
<text>Moses Wilhelm Shapira (; 1830 – March 9, 1884) was a Jerusalem antiquities dealer and purveyor of both authentic and forged Semitic antiquities, including some allegedly Biblical artifacts, the most high profile of which was the Shapira Scroll. The shame brought about by accusations that he was involved in the forging of that specific allegedly ancient biblical text and the difficult situation created by the scandal drove him to suicide in 1884. Recent scholarship by Idan Dershowitz says that the Shapira Scroll may have been authentic and a predecessor to the canonical book of Deuteronomy.

==Early life and career==
Moses Shapira was born in 1830 to Polish-Jewish parents in Kamenets-Podolski, which at the time was part of Russian-annexed Poland (in modern-day Ukraine). Shapira&#x27;s father emigrated to Ottoman Palestine without Moses. Later, in 1856, at the age of 25, Moses Shapira followed his father to the Holy Land. His grandfather, who accompanied him, died en route.

On the way, while in Bucharest, Moses Shapira converted to Christianity and applied for Prussian citizenship, adding Wilhelm to his name. Once in Jerusalem, he joined the community of Protestant missionaries and converts who met at Christ Church, and in 1869 opened a store in the Street of the Christians, today&#x27;s Christian Quarter Road. He sold the usual religious souvenirs enjoyed by pilgrims, as well as ancient pots he acquired from Arab farmers. While a patient in the German Lutheran congregation of Deaconess sisters, Shapira met a nurse, Deaconess Rosette Jöckel, who became his wife.

==Antiquities dealer and alleged forger==
In addition to selling souvenirs to tourists, Shapira also sold a variety of antiquities, some legitimate, and some fake, becoming the pre-eminent antiquities dealer for European collectors.

Shapira attempted to sell a fake &quot;coffin of Samson&quot; in London, but it was exposed by Adolf Neubauer after he realized the epitaph had misspelled the name as &quot;Sampson.&quot;

After the lucrative 1873 Moabitica deal in which he sold 1,700 fake figurines to a Berlin museum, Shapira was able to move outside the Old City walls of Jerusalem with his family into an elegant villa north of Jaffa Road, today known as Beit Ticho (Ticho House).

==Moabite forgeries==
Shapira became interested in biblical artifacts after the appearance of the so-called Moabite Stone, also known as the Mesha Stele. He witnessed the huge interest around it and may have had a hand in negotiating on behalf of the German representatives. France eventually got the fragments of the original stone, leaving the British and the Germans rather frustrated.

The squeeze which helped reconstruct the shattered Mesha Stele was taken on behalf of the French scholar and diplomat Charles Clermont-Ganneau by a Christian Arab painter and &quot;dragoman&quot; (tour-guide), Salim al-Khouri, better known as Salim al-Kari, &quot;the reader&quot;, a nickname apparently given to him by the Bedouin due to his work with ancient alphabets. Salim soon became Shapira&#x27;s associate and provided connections to Arab craftsmen who, along with Salim himself, produced for Shapira&#x27;s shop large amounts of fake Moabite artifacts – large stone-made human heads, but mainly clay objects: vessels, figurines and erotic pieces, generously covered with inscriptions based chiefly on the signs Salim had copied from the Mesha Stele. To modern scholars, the products seem clumsy – inscriptions do not translate to anything legible, for one – but at the time there was little with which to compare them. Shapira even organized an expedition to Moab for potential buyers, to sites where he had Salim&#x27;s Bedouin associates bury more forgeries. Some scholars began to base theories on these pieces, and the term Moabitica was coined for this entirely new category of &quot;Moabite&quot; artifacts.

Since German archaeologists had not gained possession of the Moabite Stone, they rushed to buy the Shapira Collection ahead of their rivals. Berlin&#x27;s Altes Museum bought 1700 artifacts for the cost of 22,000 thalers in 1873. Other private collectors followed suit. One of them was Horatio Kitchener, a not yet famous British lieutenant, who bought eight pieces for the Palestine Exploration Fund. Shapira was able to move to the luxurious Aga Rashid property (modern-day Ticho House), outside Jerusalem&#x27;s squalid Old City, with his wife and two daughters.

Still various people, including Charles Clermont-Ganneau, had their doubts. Clermont-Ganneau suspected Salim al-Kari, questioned him and in time found the man who supplied him with clay, a stonemason who worked for him, and other accomplices. He published his findings in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; newspaper in London and declared all &quot;Moabitica&quot; to be forgeries, a conclusion with which even the German scholars eventually concurred (cf. Emil Friedrich Kautzsch and Albert Socin, &quot;Die Echtheit der moabitischen Altertümer geprüft&quot;, 1876). Shapira defended his collection vigorously until his rivals presented more evidence against them. He placed the entire blame on Salim al-Kari, convinced almost everyone that he was just an innocent victim, and continued to do a considerable trade especially in genuine old Hebrew manuscripts from Yemen.

==Manuscript affair==

In 1870, Shapira sold five scrolls written on leather to Edward Yorke McCauley; these were discovered in 1884 to have been artificially aged.

In 1883, Shapira presented what is now known as the &quot;Shapira Strips&quot;, a supposedly ancient scroll written on leather strips which he claimed had been found near the Dead Sea. The Hebrew text hinted at a different version of Deuteronomy, including a surprising alternate commandment (&quot;Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: I am God, thy God&quot;). Shapira sought to sell them to the British Museum for a million pounds, and allowed them to exhibit two of the 15 strips. The exhibition was attended by thousands.

However, Clermont-Ganneau also attended the exhibition; Shapira had denied him access to the other 13 strips. After close examination, Clermont-Ganneau declared them to be forgeries. Soon afterward British biblical scholar Christian David Ginsburg came to the same conclusion. Later Clermont-Ganneau showed that the leather of the Deuteronomy scroll was quite possibly cut from the margin of a genuine Yemenite scroll that Shapira had previously sold to the Museum.

Following the rejection of the scroll by a large range of scholars, &quot;Punch&quot; ridiculed Shapira with a cartoon using anti-Semitic stereotypes.

Shapira fled London in despair, his name ruined and all of his hopes crushed. Having spent some time in a hotel in Bloemendaal (Netherlands), in hotel Adler in Rotterdam, he shot himself in Hotel Willemsbrug in Rotterdam on March 9, 1884. He was buried in the poor men&#x27;s part of the Crooswijk cemetery.

The Shapira Strips disappeared and then reappeared a couple of years later in a Sotheby&#x27;s auction, where they were sold for 10 guineas. Although it is now known that the strips were not destroyed by fire in 1899 as had previously been suggested, the fact that their current whereabouts is unknown leaves room for speculation.

In light of the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls in 1947, some scholars have called for a re-examination of the forgery charges.

==Heritage==
Shapira &quot;Moabitica&quot; fakes still exist in museums and private collections around the world but are rarely displayed. By now they have become desirable collectibles in their own right.

The exact location of Shapira&#x27;s shop on Christian Quarter Road in Jerusalem has now been identified.

==Personal life==
Shapira was married to Rosette Jöckel and had two daughters with her; Maria Rosette Shapira (pen name: Myriam Harry) and Augusta Louisa Wilhelmina Shapira.

==In literature==
Shapira&#x27;s life is the subject of the novel &quot;Ke-heres Ha-nishbar&quot; (As a Broken Vessel - Keter, Jerusalem, 1984) by Shulamit Lapid, translated into German as &quot;Er begab sich in die Hand des Herrn&quot;.

<doc id="336339" wikidata="Q1183716" url="?curid=336339" title="Shinichi Fujimura">
<text>is a Japanese amateur archaeologist who claimed he had found a large number of stone artifacts dating back to the Lower Paleolithic and Middle Paleolithic periods. These objects were later revealed to be forgeries.

==Success==
Fujimura was born in Kami, Miyagi, in 1950. After graduating from a high school in Sendai, he obtained a job in a manufacturing company. He became intrigued by archaeology when he was a child, finding shards of Jōmon pottery in the backyard of his house.

In 1972 Fujimura began to study archaeology and to look for Paleolithic artifacts during his holidays. Within the few years to follow, he rose to fame among amateur and academic archaeologists in Sendai by which he was appointed the head of the NGO group, &quot;Sekki Bunka Kenkyukai&quot; (&quot;石器文化硏究会&quot;, literally translated to &quot;stone tool culture research association&quot;) in 1975. Fujimura discovered and excavated many Paleolithic stone artifacts in Miyagi prefecture, such as at &quot;Zazaragi site&quot; in 1981, &quot;Nakamine C site&quot; in 1983 and &quot;Babadan A site&quot; in 1984. From a cross-dating investigation of the stratum these stone tools were estimated to be about 50,000 years old.

He established his reputation as a leading amateur archaeologist because he found most of the artifacts on his own. He even became known as the archaeologist with the &quot;divine hands&quot;.

After this success, he participated in 180 archaeological digs in northern Japan and almost always found artifacts, their age becoming increasingly older. Based on his discoveries the history of the Japanese Paleolithic period was extended to about 300,000 years. Most of the archaeologists did not question Fujimura&#x27;s work and this discovery was written in the history textbooks. Later he gained a position as a deputy director at the private NGO group &quot;Tohoku Paleolithic Institute&quot;.

==Criticism==
Despite the acquiescence from the archeologists, some geologists and anthropologists claimed the discovery was dubious and lacked consistency with the geologic analysis of the sites.

Takeoka Toshiki at the Kyoritsu Joshi University published an article

Shizuo Oda and Charles T. Keally also mentioned some peculiarities in their article

==Disclosure==
On October 23, 2000, Fujimura and his team announced another finding at the Kamitakamori ruins near Tsukidate in Miyagi Prefecfure. Fujimura claimed to have found the postholes of an early Paleolithic period dwelling, which would have been the nation&#x27;s oldest, between 600,000 and 120,000 years old.

On November 5, 2000, the newspaper &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; published pictures of Fujimura digging holes and burying 61 objects at Kamitakamori, which he and his team later unearthed. The pictures had been taken one day before his Kamitakamori discovery was announced. Fujimura confessed and apologized the same day in a press conference, saying that he had been &quot;possessed by an uncontrollable urge&quot;. At first, Fujimura denied his previous discoveries were faked.

In 2001 the Japanese Archaeological Association reviewed all of Fujimura&#x27;s &quot;discoveries&quot; and concluded that he&#x27;d planted artifacts at 42 excavation sites. The following year, the association formally concluded that none of the objects supposedly found by Fujimura were correctly dated, finding that some bore marks from metal implements, and that some were just stones.

Fujimura was expelled from both the Japanese Archaeological Association and the Tōhuku Paleolithic Institute, whose chairman resigned as a result of the scandal.

<text>The Setesdal Line () was a railway between Kristiansand and Byglandsfjord in southern Norway, long. It was built with a narrow gauge of , and opened to Hægeland 26 November 1895, and to Byglandsfjord 27 November 1896. Stations along the line included Mosby, Vennesla, Grovene (Grovane), Iveland and Hægeland.

Today, only the stretch between Grovane and Røyknes of the original line is preserved as a heritage railway.

== History ==
When the standard gauged Sørlandet Line was opened to Kristiansand in 1938, Grovane became the new terminal station for the Setesdal Line, with connection to the Sørlandet Line.

The Setesdal Line was suspended from 1 September 1962, and the track was lifted between Byglandsfjord and Beihølen. The line between Beihølen and Grovane was, however, preserved by local enthusiasts. The Setesdal Line Hobby Club was already established in 1964.

Today, the Setesdal Line is a railway museum with steam trains serving the line between Grovane and Røyknes. Four steam locomotives from 1894-1902 are preserved, along with a number of passenger and freight cars.

== The preserved locomotives ==
=== Narrow gauge steam locomotives ===

*Class XXI number 1, built at Dübs and Company in 1894.
*Class XXI number 2, built at Dübs and Company in 1894.
*Class XXI number 5, built at Thunes Mekaniske Værksted in 1901.
*Class XXII number 6, built at Thunes Mekaniske Værksted in 1902.

=== Narrow gauge diesel locomotives ===
*SJ Class Z4t number 227, built in 1950. Bought from the SJ in 1976.
*SJ Class Z4t number 307, built in 1952. Bought from the SJ in 1981.

=== Narrow gauge railcars ===
*Cmbo-1 number 2672, built in 1932 at Strømmens Værksted. 56 passengers.
*Cmdo Sulitelma, built in 1957 at Strømmens Værksted. 56 passengers. Transferred to the Setesdal Line after the closure of Sulitjelma Line.

=== Standard gauge diesel locomotives ===
These locomotives are only used for shunting at areas with dual gauge track.

*Skd 206 number 39, built in 1936.
*Skd 206 number 44, built in 1936.

== Heritage railway stations and stops ==

The following stations and stops exist at the current railway museum:
== Setesdal Line 1896 - 1938 ==
Connection with steamboat on Lake Byglandsfjorden from Byglandsfjord Station. The railway line was closed in 1962, but parts of the railroad have been preserved. It is a current narrow-gauge heritage railroad between Røyknes and Grovane and the current standard gauged track from Grovane Station to Kristiansand Station is a part of the current Sørlandet Line. Several of the station buildings along the former railroad are still preserved. Rail passengers had to change trains at Grovane Station from 1938 to 1962 due to different track widths, narrow-gauge to normal gauge.

<doc id="336342" wikidata="Q461027" url="?curid=336342" title="Andrée de Jongh">
<text>Countess Andrée Eugénie Adrienne de Jongh (30 November 1916 – 13 October 2007), called Dédée and Postman, was a member of the Belgian Resistance during the Second World War. She organised and led the Comet Line (&quot;Le Réseau Comète&quot;) to assist Allied soldiers and airmen to escape from Nazi-occupied Belgium. The airmen were survivors of military airplanes shot down over Belgium or other European countries. Between August 1941 and December 1942, she escorted 118 people, including more than 80 airmen, from Belgium to neutral Spain from where they were transported to the United Kingdom. Arrested by the Nazis in January 1943, she was incarcerated for the remainder of World War II. After the war, she worked in leper hospitals in Africa.

De Jongh was the recipient of the George Medal from the United Kingdom, the Medal of Freedom with golden palms from the United States, and many other medals for her work during World War II. In 1985 she was made a countess by the king of Belgium. Her exploits were described in or inspired several books, movies, and television shows.

== Early life ==

Andrée or Dédée de Jongh was born in Schaerbeek in Belgium, then under German occupation during the First World War. She was the younger daughter of Frédéric de Jongh, the headmaster of a primary school and Alice Decarpentrie. Edith Cavell, a British nurse shot in the Tir national in Schaerbeek in 1915 for assisting troops to escape from occupied Belgium to the neutral Netherlands, was her heroine.

She trained as a nurse and became a commercial artist in Malmedy. Her nursing endeavours were inspired by Cavell. She was 23 years old when the Germans invaded and occupied Belgium. De Jongh was described by a British airman she helped as a &quot;frail young girl who appears twenty years [old], very pretty, pleasant, kind, cheerful, and simple. She seems to have the carelessness of a young student who would go on vacation after passing her exams&quot;. Later, a British colonel would call her a
&quot;pure heroine of legend&quot;.

== Origin of the Comet Line ==

After German troops invaded and occupied Belgium in May 1940, de Jongh moved to Brussels, where she became a Red Cross volunteer, ministering to captured Allied troops. In Brussels at that time, hiding in safe houses, were many British soldiers, those left behind at Dunkirk and escapees from those captured at Saint-Valery-en-Caux. De Jongh organised a series of safe houses for these soldiers, while also procuring civilian clothes for them as well as false ID papers. Visiting the sick and wounded soldiers enabled her to make links with this network of safe-house keepers who were trying to work out ways to get the soldiers back to Britain.

In spring 1941, Henri de Bliqui, Arnold Deppè, and Andrée de Jongh organised a group of friends to help Allied soldiers and airmen escape occupied Belgium and return to Great Britain. This was the origin of what became known as the Comet Line, the largest of the escape and evasion lines in World War II. They initially called themselves the DDDs after their last names. De Bliqui was arrested in April 1941 and later executed after the group was infiltrated by Prosper Dezitter, a Belgian collaborator with the Germans.

In June 1941, Deppé journeyed from Belgium to southwestern France where he had once lived to look for the means to smuggle Allied soldiers, downed airmen, and other people vulnerable to capture by the Germans out of Belgium. Deppé made contact with Elvire de Greef and her family and arranged for their help in getting people across the border. De Greef became known as &quot;Tante Go&quot; (&quot;Auntie Go&quot;).

De Jongh and Deppé, assisted by the de Greefs, attempted their first crossing of the Spanish border in July 1941 with ten Belgians and &quot;Miss Richards,&quot; supposedly an English woman but actually a Belgian secret agent named Frederique Dupuich. After they successfully crossed the Pyrenees mountains on the Franco-Spanish border, de Jongh and Deppé left their charges to fend for themselves and returned to Belgium. The ten Belgians and &quot;Miss Richards&quot; were arrested by Spanish police. Three Belgian soldiers among them were turned over to the Germans in France. From this experience, de Jongh realised that in future exfiltrations they must establish a relationship with the British Consulate in Bilbao to ensure the safety in Spain of the people they escorted out of occupied Belgian and France.

In August, Deppé and de Jongh escorted another group of people, de Jongh taking a longer, more rural, and safer route with three men, including a British soldier, and Deppé a shorter, more dangerous route with six men. An informer betrayed Deppé and his party and they were arrested by the Germans. Deppé was imprisoned for the remainder of the war. De Jongh arrived safely at the de Greef house in Anglet and crossed into Spain with a Basque smuggler as a guide. She appeared in the British consulate in Bilbao with a British soldier (James Cromar from Aberdeen) and two Belgian volunteers (Merchiers and Sterckmans), having travelled mostly by train from Brussels to Bayonne and then on foot over the Pyrenees through the Basque Country.

The British diplomats were initially sceptical of de Jongh. It seemed unlikely to them that this young woman with three soldiers in tow had travelled from German-occupied Belgium, through occupied France, and over the Pyrenees to Spain, a straight-line distance of some (and much further by the roundabout route they had taken). De Jongh promised to exfiltrate additional British soldiers and airmen if the British would pay the Comet Line&#x27;s expenses which were 6,000 Belgian Francs and 1,400 Spanish Pesetas (the sum of the two currencies amounting to the equivalent of $2,000 in 2018 U.S. dollars) for each Allied airmen or soldier exfiltrated. After three weeks of doubt, suspicion that she was a German agent, and indecision by British authorities in Spain and England, the British agreed to her terms. Except for financial assistance, de Jongh turned down all other British offers of advice and assistance. She rejected efforts by the British and the Belgian government in exile to control or direct the Comet Line. British agent Donald Darling (&quot;Sunday&quot;) gave her the code name of &quot;Postman.&quot;

== Exfiltrating Allied airmen ==

The arrest of Arnold Deppé in August 1941 introduced a note of caution into the Comet Line. Andrée de Jongh decided that Belgium was unsafe and thereafter worked and lived in Paris and Valenciennes, a French city on the border with Belgium. Her father Frederic took over some of her leadership duties in Belgium. In France, de Jongh received airmen from Brussels, cared for them in safe houses, escorted them by railroad to Bayonne or nearby cities near the Spanish border, and trekked with them across the Pyrenees to Spain. She escorted one group of three airmen in October 1941, another group of three in November, and two groups totaling 11 men in December 1941. That level of activity continued in 1942. Once she had successfully crossed the border, de Jongh turned her charges over to the British who would drive them to Gibraltar where they would be flown back to Great Britain. While the airmen proceeded onward, de Jongh met in San Sebastián with British diplomat Michael Creswell, (&quot;Monday&quot;), who gave her money for the Comet Line&#x27;s expenses plus messages to take back to France. While returning to Paris she reinforced the system of safe houses and helpers along the route and paid necessary expenses, although most members of Comet Line never received any compensation for their expenses.

Estimates of the number of times that de Jongh successfully escorted downed airmen across the border into Spain in 1941 and 1942 vary from 16 to 24 round trips. The number of persons, mostly airmen, she escorted successfully is about 118.

== Captured ==

Comet Line members and their families took great risks. Working for escape lines became more dangerous after November 1942 when southern France was occupied by the Germans and the whole of France came under direct Nazi rule. During the war hundreds of workers for the Comet Line were arrested by the &quot;Geheime Feldpolizei&quot; of the &quot;Abwehr&quot; and many were executed or deported to German prisons and concentration camps.

In January 1943, de Jongh led three British airmen south by train from Paris to Saint-Jean-de-Luz. From the railway station they walked in rain for two hours to the village of Urrugne, in the French Basque Country – the last stop on the escape line before the walk over the Pyrenees. With the airmen and de Jongh was her favorite Basque guide Florentino Goikoetxea, a smuggler wanted by the police on both sides of the border. They arrived at the safe house belonging to Frantxia Usandizanga, a Basque woman, intending to continue to the border, distant. However, the river Bidasoa on the border was in flood and it would be too dangerous to attempt to cross. Goikoetxea went to another house to spend the night and de Jongh and the three airmen spent the night at Usandizanga&#x27;s house. The next morning, 15 January 1943, de Jongh, the three airmen, and Usandizanga were arrested in the house by ten German soldiers. They had been betrayed, probably by a farm worker named Donato whom de Jongh knew but did not trust.

De Jongh was sent first to Fresnes prison in Paris and eventually to Ravensbrück concentration camp and Mauthausen. She was interrogated 19 times by the Abwehr and twice by the Gestapo. Although she admitted being the leader of the Comet Line to protect her father who was under suspicion, the Germans did not believe that this slight, young woman was more than a minor helper in the Comet Line. Their underestimation of de Jongh&#x27;s importance in the Comet Line probably saved her from execution. Later, while she was a prisoner in Ravensbrück, the Gestapo realized who she was and searched for her, but she eluded them by hiding her identity.

In de Jongh&#x27;s absence and under the leadership of Jean Greindl and Antoine d&#x27;Ursel, the Comet Line continued to function and helped more than 700 Allied soldiers reach safety during the war. Although de Jongh survived in the concentration camps, she became gravely ill and undernourished by the time she was released by the advancing Allies in April 1945. Many of her colleagues died in captivity. Her father, Frédéric de Jongh was arrested in Paris on 7 June 1943 and executed on 28 March 1944. The three airmen arrested with her survived the war in prisoner-of-war camps. Usandizanga was beaten to death in Ravensbrück by a guard shortly before the camp&#x27;s liberation in April 1945. Goikoetxea continued to be the preferred Comet Line guide until wounded and captured by the Germans (but rescued by the de Greef family) shortly before France was liberated by the Allies in 1944.

After her concentration camp experiences, de Jongh resurfaced in summer 1945 in the middle of the night at Donald Darling&#x27;s Paris Awards Office. She still wore the pink and white striped dress that was the camp uniform. She was thin and suffering from health problems that lasted for the rest of her life.

== Later life ==
Post-war, de Jongh finished her nursing studies and worked in leprosariums, first in the Belgian Congo, then in Cameroon, next in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. and finally in Senegal. While de Jongh was working in Ethiopia, her mother was on her deathbed in Belgium and, in a measure of respect to her, the Royal Air Force made an unscheduled stop in Addis Ababa to take her to Belgium and later returned her to Ethiopia. In 1959, while working at a leper colony in Coquilhatville, she met English novelist Graham Greene. Greene recorded her candid account of her war experiences in his journal which was published in 1961. In &quot;In Search of a Character: Two African Journals&quot;, Greene wrote that he asked her why she had come to the Congo; she replied, &quot;Because from the age of fifteen I wanted to cure lepers. If I had delayed any longer it would have been too late.&quot; In poor health she eventually returned to Belgium with her colleague, Thérèse de Wael.

For her wartime efforts, she was awarded the United States Medal of Freedom with golden palms, the British George Medal on 13 February 1946, and became a Chevalier of the French Légion d&#x27;honneur. She also became a Chevalier of the Order of Leopold, received the Belgian Croix de Guerre/Oorlogskruis with palm, and was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Belgian Army. In 1985, she was made a Countess in the Belgian nobility by King Baudouin.

== Death ==

The Countess de Jongh died on 13 October 2007, aged 90, at the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, Brussels. Her funeral service was held at the La Cambre Abbey, Ixelles, Brussels, and she was interred in the crypt of her parents at the Schaerbeek Cemetery.

<text>Phantly Roy Bean Jr. (c. 1825 – March 16, 1903) was an American saloon-keeper and Justice of the Peace in Val Verde County, Texas, who called himself &quot;The Only Law West of the Pecos&quot;. According to legend, he held court in his saloon along the Rio Grande on a desolate stretch of the Chihuahuan Desert of southwest Texas. After his death, fictional Western films and books cast him as a , although he is known to have sentenced only two men to hang, one of whom escaped.

==Early life==
Roy Bean was born circa 1825 in Mason County, Kentucky, and was the namesake and youngest of five children (four sons and a daughter) of Phantly Roy Bean Sr. (November 21, 1804 – June 13, 1844) and the former Anna Henderson Gore. The family was extremely poor; at age sixteen Bean left home to ride a flatboat to New Orleans, hoping to find work. 

After getting into trouble in New Orleans, Bean fled to San Antonio, Texas, to join his elder brother Sam. Samuel Gore &quot;Sam&quot; Bean (1819–1903), who had earlier migrated to Independence, Missouri, was a teamster and bullwhacker. He hauled freight to Santa Fe and then on to Chihuahua, Mexico. Sam had moved out of San Antonio after fighting in the Mexican–American War. 

In 1848 the two brothers opened a trading post in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Soon after, Roy Bean shot and killed a Mexican desperado who had threatened &quot;to kill a gringo&quot;. To escape being charged with murder by Mexican authorities, Roy and Sam Bean fled west to Sonora, Mexico. By the spring of 1849, Roy Bean had moved to San Diego, California, to live with his elder brother Joshua Bean. The latter was elected the first mayor of San Diego the following year, after California became part of the Union.

Considered handsome, Bean competed for the attentions of various local women. A Scotsman named John Collins challenged Bean to a pistol-shooting match on horseback. Bean was left to choose the targets and decided that they would shoot at each other. The duel was fought on February 24, 1852, and ended with Collins receiving a wound to his right arm. Both men were arrested and charged with assault with intent to murder. 

In the two months that he was in jail, Bean received many gifts of flowers, food, wine and cigars from women in San Diego. Hidden in the final gifts he received there were knives that were encased in tamales. Bean used the knives to dig through the cell wall and escaped on April 17, 1852. He fled to San Gabriel, California, where he became a bartender in his elder brother Joshua&#x27;s &quot;Headquarters Saloon&quot;. After Joshua was murdered in November 1852, Bean inherited the saloon. In 1854 Bean courted a young woman who was subsequently kidnapped and forced to marry a Mexican officer. Bean challenged the groom to a duel and killed him. Six of the dead man&#x27;s friends put Bean on a horse and tied a noose around his neck, leaving him to hang when the horse moved. When he was hanged, the rope stretched and Bean was able to stay alive. The bride, who had been hiding behind a tree, cut the rope, freeing him and saving his life. This experience left Bean with a permanent rope burn and a stiff neck for the rest of his life. 

Shortly thereafter, Bean chose to leave California and migrated to New Mexico to live with Sam, who had been elected the first sheriff of Doña Ana County. 

In 1861 Samuel G. and Roy Bean operated a store and saloon on Main Street in Pinos Altos (just north of Silver City) in present-day Grant County, New Mexico. It advertised liquor and &quot;a fine billiard table&quot;. Roy&#x27;s cannon, which had been used to repel an Apache assault on the town, was displayed in front of the store.

==Move to Texas==
During the Civil War, the Confederate Army had invaded New Mexico. During the Battle of Glorieta Pass in March 1862, the Confederates lost their supply wagons and were forced to retreat to San Antonio. After taking money from his brother&#x27;s safe, Bean joined the retreating army. For the remainder of the war, he ran the naval blockade by hauling cotton from San Antonio to British ships off the coast at Matamoros and returning with needed supplies. For the next twenty years, Bean lived in San Antonio, working nominally as a teamster. During this time he attempted to run a firewood business by cutting down a neighbor&#x27;s timber. He then tried to run a dairy business but was soon caught watering down the milk. Bean later worked as a butcher, rustling unbranded cattle from other area ranchers for his business.

On October 28, 1866, he married eighteen-year-old Virginia Chavez. Within a year after being married, he was arrested for aggravated assault and threatening his wife&#x27;s life. Despite the tumultuous marriage, they had four children together: Roy Jr., Laura, Zulema and Sam. The family lived in what was described as &quot;a poverty-stricken Mexican slum area called Beanville&quot;. Beanville would have been centered near the present-day corner of South Flores Street and Glenn Avenue not far from Burbank High School. By the late 1870s Bean was operating a saloon in Beanville and had heard that many construction camps were opening as several railroad companies were working to extend the railroads west. A store owner in Beanville &quot;was so anxious to have this unscrupulous character out of the neighborhood&quot; that she bought all of Bean&#x27;s possessions for $900 so that he could leave San Antonio. At the time, Bean and his wife were separated and he had left his children with friends as he prepared to go west.

===Justice of the peace===

With the money he received, Bean purchased a tent, some supplies to sell, and ten 55-gallon barrels of whiskey. By the spring of 1882, he had established a small saloon near the Pecos River in a tent city he named Vinegaroon. Within of the tent city were 8,000 railroad workers. The nearest court was away at Fort Stockton, and there were few means to stop illegal activity. A Texas Ranger requested that a local law jurisdiction be set up in Vinegaroon, and on August 2, 1882, Bean was appointed justice of the peace for the new Precinct 6 in Pecos County. His first case, however, had been heard earlier, on 25 July 1882, when Texas Rangers brought in Joe Bell to be tried.

One of his first acts as a justice of the peace was to &quot;shoot [...] up the saloon shack of a Jewish competitor&quot;. Bean then turned his tent saloon into a part-time courtroom and began calling himself the &quot;Only Law West of the Pecos&quot;. As a judge, Bean relied on a single law book, the 1879 edition of the &quot;Revised Statutes of Texas&quot;, and when newer law books showed up he used them as kindling. Bean did not allow hung juries or appeals. Jurors, who were chosen from his best bar customers, were expected to buy a drink during every court recess. He was also known for his unusual rulings. In one case, an Irishman named Paddy O&#x27;Rourke shot a Chinese laborer. During the trial, a mob of 200 angry Irishmen surrounded the courtroom and saloon, threatening to lynch Bean if O&#x27;Rourke was not freed. After looking through his law book, Bean ruled that &quot;homicide was the killing of a human being; however, he could find no law against killing a Chinaman&quot; and subsequently dismissed the case.

By December 1882, railroad construction had moved farther westward and Bean moved his courtroom and saloon to Strawbridge (now Sanderson). He sent for his children, who then lived with him at the saloon, with his youngest son Sam sleeping on a pool table. A competitor who was already established in the area laced Bean&#x27;s whiskey with kerosene. Unable to attract customers, Bean left the area and moved to Eagle&#x27;s Nest, west of the Pecos River, which was soon renamed Langtry.
The original owner of the land, who ran a saloon, had sold to the railroad on the condition that no part of the land could be sold or leased to Bean. O&#x27;Rourke, the Irishman whose case Bean had previously dismissed, told Bean to use the railroad right-of-way, which was not covered by the contract, and for the next 20 years Bean squatted on land he had no legal right to use. Bean named his new saloon The Jersey Lilly in honor of Lillie Langtry, who recounted in her autobiography that she had visited the area after Bean&#x27;s death. She did, however, send to Bean a pair of Colt .45 pistols. Langtry did not have a jail – although it is reported that outside The Jersey Lilly was a large oak tree with a heavy log chain that served as a &quot;jail&quot; for those unable to pay their fines; all cases were settled by fines. Bean refused to send the state any part of the fines, and kept all of the money. In most cases the fines were made for the exact amount the accused person was carrying.

Bean was noted for his unusual verdicts, some of which are reported to have been:
*Upon finding the corpse of a Southern Pacific railroad workman who had been killed after he fell from a high bridge over the Pecos River, the man having been carrying a pistol in his pocket and $40 on his person when he had died, the judge rendered a verdict of accidental death and then imposed a posthumous $40 fine [a $20 fine upon the man for having carried the concealed weapons. Bean, whose court/saloon was in need of money at the time, and was also a Coroner collected a burial fee of $10 and $10 in court costs].
*When a train passenger tossed a $20 gold piece for a beer, Bean refused to give any change. When the stranger protested, Bean fined him $19.95 for contempt of court and threatened to double the fine if the stranger said another word; the stranger left on a train.
*Although only district courts were legally allowed to grant divorces, Bean did so anyway, and pocketed $10 for each divorce. He charged $5 for weddings, and ended all wedding ceremonies with the phrase &quot;and may God have mercy on your souls&quot; (a traditional saying when a death sentence is carried out). After Bean performed the marriage of two Mexican couples, they later came before Bean and asked to be divorced and remarried to the other person&#x27;s spouses; Bean agreed to the demand, charging each $10 for the marriages and $40 for the divorces.
*When a Mexican man received permission for one day off from his boss to marry his future wife but there was not enough time for a license, Bean married them anyway and proclaimed that the marriage license would arrive by the next day&#x27;s mail after charging them his usual $5 marriage fee.
*A rival saloon owner named Torrano was brought before Bean on an assault charge; a jury of six men found the accused guilty and fined him two dozen bottles of beer. Bean stopped his rival from buying beer at his own saloon and instead had him pay the fine at The Jersey Lilly.
*A railroad contractor named Howard who had some law training was brought into court and read from the latest revised law statutes; Bean remitted the fine but rendered a verdict that no law books were to be brought into his court.
*When a young ranchman was fined $5 for fighting, he produced witness that he had not been fighting but had held the other person off. Bean remitted the fine but fined the other man $10 – who had skipped town. The ranchman was committed until the fine was paid; the ranchman paid the fine.
Bean won re-election to his post in 1884, but was defeated in 1886. The following year, the commissioner&#x27;s court created a new precinct in the county and appointed Bean to be the new justice of the peace. He continued to be re-elected until 1896. Even after the election defeat, he &quot;refused to surrender his seal and law book and continued to try all cases north of the tracks&quot;.
*On April 16, 1897, there was an accidental collision between two trains in which one man was killed and four scalded; Bean presided over an inquest concerning the train wreck of the G.H.&amp; S. railroad between Bean and Langtry finding one man had formerly been a fireman on the Southern Pacific Railroad. The dead man was identified as Robert Beckman; Bean had him brought to Langtry and buried in the Langtry graveyard.
*During his term as a judge, Bean is known to have sentenced only two men to hang, one of whom escaped. Horse thieves, who were often sentenced to death in other jurisdictions, were always let go if the horses were returned to their owners. Prior to May 1897 &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Weekly&quot; printed an item &quot;The picture in your publication of March 11 of Judge Roy Bean is all right, except the collar and cravat. He was once trying a Mexican on a charge of horse stealing and his charge was the shortest on record: Gentlemen of the Jury, there&#x27;s a greaser in the box and a hoss missing. You know your duty, and they did.&quot;.

==Later years and death==

In 1890, Bean received word that railroad developer and speculator Jay Gould was planning to pass through Langtry on a special train. Bean flagged down the train using a danger signal. Thinking the bridge was out, the train engineer stopped the train. Bean then invited Gould and his daughter to visit the saloon as his guests. The Goulds visited for two hours, causing a brief panic on the New York Stock Exchange when it was reported that Gould had been killed in a train crash.

In 1896, Bean organized a world championship boxing title bout between Bob Fitzsimmons and Peter Maher on an island in the Rio Grande because boxing matches were illegal in both Texas and Mexico. The fight, won by Fitzsimmons, lasted only 1 minute and 35 seconds, but the resulting sport reports spread Bean&#x27;s fame throughout the United States.

As he aged, Bean spent much of his profits helping the poor of the area and always made sure that the local schoolhouse had free firewood in the winter. In January 1901 Bean stated that a claim for damages of $13,000 from Apache depredations of his mules would certainly be allowed.

Bean died peacefully in his bed on March 16, 1903, after a bout of heavy drinking in San Antonio. He and his son, Sam Bean (1874–1907), are interred at the Whitehead Memorial Museum in Del Rio. In 1965, as part of the Civil War Centennial commemoration in Texas, an official Texas Historical Marker honoring Bean was erected on the museum grounds.

<doc id="336344" wikidata="Q352469" url="?curid=336344" title="Saburō Sakai">
<text>was a Japanese naval aviator and flying ace (&quot;Gekitsui-O&quot;, ) of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Sakai had 28 aerial victories, including shared ones, according to official Japanese records, though he and his ghostwriter Martin Caidin claimed much higher numbers.

==Early life==
Saburō Sakai was born on 25 August 1916 in Saga Prefecture, Japan. He was born into a family with an immediate affiliation to the samurai and their warrior legacies. Their ancestors were themselves samurai and had taken part in the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) but were later forced to take up a livelihood of farming after &quot;haihan-chiken&quot; in 1871. He was the third-born of four sons (his given name literally means &quot;third son&quot;) and had three sisters. Sakai was 11 when his father died, which left his mother alone to raise seven children. With limited resources, Sakai was adopted by his maternal uncle, who financed his education in a Tokyo high school. However, Sakai failed to do well in his studies and was sent back to Saga after his second year.
On 31 May 1933, at the age of 16, Sakai enlisted in the Imperial Japanese Navy as a Sailor Fourth Class (Seaman Recruit) (四等水兵) at the Sasebo Naval Base. Sakai described his experiences as a naval recruit:
:&quot;The petty officers would not hesitate to administer the severest beatings to recruits they felt deserving of punishment. Whenever I committed a breach of discipline or an error in training, I was dragged physically from my cot by a petty officer. &#x27;Stand tall to the wall! Bend down, Recruit Sakai!&#x27; he would roar. &#x27;I am not doing this because I hate you, but because I like you and want you to make a good seaman. &quot;Bend down!&quot;&#x27; And with that he would swing a large stick of wood and with every ounce of strength he possessed would slam it against my upturned bottom. The pain was terrible, the force of the blows unremitting.&quot; &quot;There was no choice but to grit my teeth and struggle desperately not to cry out. At times I counted up to forty crashing impacts into my buttocks. Often I fainted from the pain. A lapse into unconsciousness constituted no escape however. The petty officer simply hurled a bucket of cold water over my prostrate form and bellowed for me to resume position, whereupon he continued his &#x27;discipline&#x27; until satisfied I would mend the error of my ways.&quot;

After completing his training the following year, Sakai graduated as a Sailor Third Class (Ordinary Seaman) (三等水兵). He then served aboard the battleship for one year. In 1935, he successfully passed the competitive examinations for the Naval Gunners&#x27; School. Sakai was promoted to Sailor Second Class (Able Seaman) (二等水兵) in 1936, and served on the battleship as a turret gunner. He received successive promotions to Sailor First Class (Leading Seaman) (一等水兵) and to Petty Officer Third Class (三等兵曹). In early 1937, he applied for and was accepted into the navy pilot training program. He graduated first in his class at Tsuchiura in 1937 and earned a silver watch, which was presented to him by Emperor Hirohito. Sakai graduated as a carrier pilot although he was never assigned to aircraft-carrier duty. One of Sakai&#x27;s classmates was Jūzō Mori, who graduated as a carrier pilot and served on the Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū by flying Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers early in the war.

Promoted to Petty Officer Second Class (二等兵曹) in 1938, Sakai took part in aerial combat flying the Mitsubishi A5M at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1938–1939 and was wounded in action. Later, he was selected to fly the Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero fighter in combat over China.

==World War II==
===Southeast Asia===

When Japan attacked the Western Allies in 1941, Sakai participated in the attack on the Philippines as a member of the Tainan Air Group. On 8 December 1941, Sakai flew one of 45 Zeros from the Tainan Kōkūtai (a Kōkūtai was an Air Group) that attacked Clark Air Base in the Philippines. In his first combat against Americans, he shot down a Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and destroyed two B-17 Flying Fortresses by strafing them on the ground. Sakai flew missions the next day during heavy weather.

On the third day of the battle, Sakai claimed to have shot down a B-17, flown by Captain Colin P. Kelly. Sakai, who has often been credited with the victory, was a Shotai leader engaged in this fight with the bomber although he and his two wingmen do not appear to have been given official credit for it.

Early in 1942, Sakai was transferred to Tarakan Island in Borneo and fought in the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese high command instructed fighter patrols to down all enemy aircraft that were encountered, whether they were armed or not. On a patrol with his Zero over Java, just after he had shot down an enemy aircraft, Sakai encountered a civilian Dutch Douglas DC-3 flying at low altitude over dense jungle. Sakai initially assumed that it was transporting important people and signaled to its pilot to follow him, but the pilot did not obey. Sakai descended and approached the DC-3. He then saw a blonde woman and a young child through a window, along with other passengers. The woman reminded him of Mrs. Martin, an American who occasionally had taught him as a child in middle school and had been kind to him. He ignored his orders, flew ahead of the pilot, and signaled him to go ahead. The pilot and the passengers saluted him. Sakai did not mention the encounter in the aerial combat report.

During the Borneo Campaign, Sakai achieved 13 more victories before he was grounded by illness. When he recovered three months later in April, Petty Officer First Class Sakai joined a squadron (&quot;chutai&quot;) of the Tainan Kōkūtai under Sub-Lieutenant Junichi Sasai at Lae, New Guinea. Over the next four months, he scored the majority of his victories in flying against American and Australian pilots based at Port Moresby.

A myth has been perpetuated over time but declared to be product of the imagination of Martin Caidin, the co-author of Sakai&#x27;s book &quot;Samurai.&quot; Supposedly, on the night of 16 May, Sakai and his colleagues, Hiroyoshi Nishizawa and Toshio Ota, were listening to a broadcast of an Australian radio program, and Nishizawa recognized the eerie &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; of Camille Saint-Saëns. Inspired, Nishizawa is said to have come up with the idea of doing demonstration loops over the enemy airfield. The next day, his squadron included fellow aces Hiroyoshi Nishizawa and Toshio Ōta. At the end of an attack on Port Moresby, which had involved 18 Zeros, the trio performed three tight loops in close formation over the allied air base. Nishizawa indicated that he wanted to repeat the performance. Diving to , the three Zeros did three more loops without receiving any AA fire from the ground. The following day, a lone Allied bomber flew over the Lae airfield and dropped a note attached to a long cloth ribbon. A soldier picked up the note and delivered to the squadron commander. It read (paraphrased): &quot;Thank you for the wonderful display of aerobatics by three of your pilots. Please pass on our regards and inform them that we will have a warm reception ready for them, next time they fly over our airfield.&quot; The squadron commander was furious and reprimanded the three pilots for their stupidity, but the Tainan Kōkūtai&#x27;s three leading aces felt that Nishizawa&#x27;s aerial choreography of the &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; had been worth it.

===Pacific Theater===
On 3 August 1942, Sakai&#x27;s air group was relocated from Lae to the airfield at Rabaul.

On 7 August, word arrived that US Marines had landed that morning on Guadalcanal. The initial Allied landings captured an airfield, later named Henderson Field by the Allies, that had been under construction by the Japanese. The airfield soon became the focus of months of fighting during the Guadalcanal Campaign, as it enabled US airpower to hinder the Japanese in their attempts at resupplying their troops. The Japanese made several attempts to retake Henderson Field that resulted in almost daily air battles for the Tainan Kōkūtai.

US Marines flying Grumman F4F Wildcats from Henderson Field on Guadalcanal were using a new aerial combat tactic, the &quot;Thach Weave&quot;, which was developed in 1941 by the US Navy aviators John Thach and Edward O&#x27;Hare. The Japanese Zero pilots flying out of Rabaul were initially confounded by the tactic. Sakai described the reaction to the Thach Weave when they encountered Guadalcanal Wildcats using it:

On 7 August, Sakai and three pilots shot down an F4F Wildcat flown by Lieutenant James &quot;Pug&quot; Southerland of Fighting Squadron Five (VF-5), who by the end of the war became an ace with five victories. Sakai, who did not know that Southerland&#x27;s guns had jammed, recalled the duel in his autobiography:

They were soon engaged in a skillfully-maneuvered dogfight. After an extended battle in which both pilots gained and lost the upper hand, Sakai shot down Southerland&#x27;s Wildcat and struck it below the left wing root with his 20 mm cannon. Southerland parachuted to safety.

Sakai was amazed at the Wildcat&#x27;s ruggedness:
Not long after he had downed Southerland, Sakai was attacked by a lone Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bomber flown by Lieutenant Dudley Adams of &#x27;s Scouting Squadron 71 (VS-71). Adams sent a bullet through Sakai&#x27;s canopy, narrowly missing the ace&#x27;s head, but Sakai quickly gained the upper hand and succeeded in downing Adams. Although Adams bailed out and survived, his gunner, RM3/c Harry Elliot, was killed in the encounter. According to Sakai, that was his 60th victory.

===Serious wounds===
Shortly after he had shot down Southerland and Adams, Sakai spotted a flight of eight aircraft orbiting near Tulagi. Believing it to be another group of Wildcats, Sakai approached them from below and behind, aiming to catch them by surprise. However, he soon realised that he had made a mistake - the planes were in fact carrier-based bombers with rear-mounted machine guns. Despite that realisation, he had progressed too far into the attack to back off, and had no choice but to see it through.

In Sakai&#x27;s account of the battle, he identified the aircraft as Grumman TBF Avengers and stated that he could clearly see the enclosed top turret. He claimed to have shot down two of the Avengers (his 61st and 62nd victories) before return fire had struck his plane. The kills were seemingly verified by the three Zero pilots following him, but no Avengers were reported lost that day.

However, according to US Navy records, only one formation of bombers reported fighting Zeros under these circumstances. This was a group of eight SBD Dauntlesses from &quot;Enterprise&quot;, led by Lieutenant Carl Horenberger of Bombing Squadron 6 (VB-6). The SBD crews reported being attacked by two Zeros, one of which came in from directly astern and flew into the concentrated fire from their rear-mounted twin .30 AN/M2 guns. The rear gunners claimed the Zero as a kill when it dived away in distress, in return for two planes damaged (one seriously).

Whatever the case, Sakai sustained serious wounds from the bombers&#x27; return fire. He was hit in the head by a .30 caliber bullet, which injured his skull and temporarily paralyzed the left side of his body. The wound is described elsewhere as having destroyed the metal frame of his goggles and &quot;creased&quot; his skull, a glancing blow that broke the skin and made a furrow, or even cracked the skull but did not actually penetrate it. Shattered glass from the canopy temporarily blinded him in his right eye and reduced vision in his left eye severely. The Zero rolled inverted and descended towards the sea. Unable to see out of his left eye because of the glass and the blood from his serious head wound, Sakai&#x27;s vision started to clear somewhat as tears cleared the blood from his eyes, and he pulled his plane out of the dive. He considered ramming an American warship: &quot;If I must die, at least I could go out as a samurai. My death would take several of the enemy with me. A ship. I needed a ship.&quot; Finally, the cold air blasting into the cockpit revived him enough to check his instruments, and he decided that by leaning the fuel mixture, he might be able to return to the airfield at Rabaul.
Although in agony from his injuries Sakai managed to fly his damaged Zero in a 4 h 47 min flight over back to his base on Rabaul by using familiar volcanic peaks as guides. When he attempted to land at the airfield, he nearly crashed into a line of parked Zeros, but after circling four times and with the fuel gauge reading empty, he put his Zero down on the runway on his second attempt. After landing, he insisted on making his mission report to his superior officer and then collapsed. Nishizawa drove him to a surgeon. Sakai was evacuated to Japan on 12 August and there endured a long surgery without anesthesia. The surgery repaired some of the damage to his head but was unable to restore full vision to his right eye. Nishizawa visited Sakai, who was recuperating in the hospital in Yokosuka.

===Recovery and return===
After his discharge from the hospital in January 1943, Sakai spent a year in training new fighter pilots. He found the new generation of student pilots, who typically outranked veteran instructors, to be arrogant and unskilled. With Japan clearly losing the air war, he prevailed upon his superiors to let him fly in combat again. In November 1943, Sakai was promoted to the rank of flying warrant officer (飛行兵曹長). In April 1944, he was transferred to Yokosuka Air Wing, which was posted to Iwo Jima.

On 24 June 1944, Sakai approached a formation of 15 US Navy Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters, which he had mistakenly assumed to be friendly Japanese aircraft. William A. McCormick saw four Hellcats on the Zero&#x27;s tail but decided not to get involved. Despite facing superior enemy aircraft, Sakai demonstrated his skill and experience by eluding the attacks and returning to his airfield unscathed.

Sakai claimed to have never lost a wingman in combat, but he lost at least two of them over Iwo Jima.

Sakai said that he had been ordered to lead a &quot;kamikaze&quot; mission on 5 July but that he failed to find the US task force. He was engaged by Hellcat fighters near the task force&#x27;s reported position, and all but one of the Nakajima B6N2 &quot;Jill&quot; torpedo bombers in his flight were shot down. Sakai managed to shoot down one Hellcat and escaped the umbrella of enemy aircraft by flying into a cloud. Rather than follow meaningless orders in worsening weather and gathering darkness, Sakai led his small formation back to Iwo Jima. However, according to the aerial combat report, his mission was to escort bombers to and from their targets, and in the afternoon of 24 June, Sakai joined the attack on the US task force.

In August 1944, Sakai was commissioned an ensign (少尉). He was transferred to 343rd Air Group and returned to the Yokosuka Air Wing again.

About the same time, Sakai married his cousin Hatsuyo, who asked him for a dagger so that she could kill herself if he fell in battle. His autobiography, &quot;Samurai!&quot;, ends with Hatsuyo throwing away the dagger after Japan&#x27;s surrender and saying that she no longer needed it.

Saburō Sakai participated in the IJNAS&#x27;s last wartime mission by attacking two reconnaissance Consolidated B-32 Dominators on 18 August, which were conducting photo-reconnaissance and testing Japanese compliance with the ceasefire. He initially misidentified the planes as Boeing B-29 Superfortresses. Both aircraft returned to their base at Yontan Airfield, Okinawa. His encounter with the B-32 Dominators in the IJNAS&#x27;s final mission was not included in &quot;Samurai!&quot;.

Sakai was promoted to sub-lieutenant (中尉) after the war had ended.

==Post-war civilian life==

After the war, Sakai retired from the Navy. He became a Buddhist acolyte and vowed never again to kill anything that lived, even a mosquito.

Likewise, although Japan had been defeated in the Second World War with great loss of life, Sakai serenely accepted that outcome: &quot;Had I been ordered to bomb Seattle or Los Angeles in order to end the war, I wouldn&#x27;t have hesitated. So I perfectly understand why the Americans bombed Nagasaki and Hiroshima.&quot;

Times were difficult for Sakai. He had trouble finding a job, and Hatsuyo died in 1947. He remarried in 1952 and started a printing shop.

Sakai sent his daughter to college in the United States &quot;to learn English and democracy.&quot;

Sakai visited the US and met many of his former adversaries, including Lieutenant Commander Harold &quot;Lew&quot; Jones (1921–2009), the SBD Dauntless rear-seat gunner (piloted by Ensign Robert C. Shaw), who had wounded him.

After a US Navy formal dinner in 2000 at Atsugi Naval Air Station at which he had been an honored guest, Sakai died of a heart attack at the age of 84.

He was survived by his second wife, Haru, two daughters and a son.

==In popular culture==

===Books===
Claims have been made that his autobiography &quot;Samurai!&quot; includes fictional stories, and that the number of kills specified in that work were increased to promote sales of the book by Martin Caidin. The book was not published in Japan and differs from his biographies there.

&quot;Winged Samurai: Saburo Sakai and the Zero Fighter Pilots&quot; is a 1985 book by Henry Sakaida dealing with the wartime history of Saburō Sakai.

===Film===
The 1976 movie &quot;Zero Pilot&quot; dramatized Saburō Sakai’s experiences as a WWII fighter pilot. In it, Sakai is portrayed by the actor Hiroshi Fujioka. The screenplay is based on Sakai&#x27;s book &quot;Samurai!&quot;. 

==== Video games ====
In the year 2000, just before he died, Sakai (along with American Marine Corps fighter ace Joe Foss) served as a consultant for the development of &quot;Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2&quot;.

<text>Ivan Logginovich Goremykin (; 8 November 183924 December 1917) was a Russian politician who served as the prime minister of the Russian Empire in 1906 and again from 1914 to 1916, during World War I. He was the last person to have the civil rank of Active Privy Councillor, 1st class. During his time in government, Goremykin pursued conservative policies.

==Biography==
Goremykin was born on 8 November 1839 into a noble family. In 1860 he completed studies at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence and became a lawyer in Saint Petersburg. In the Senate, Goremykin became responsible for agriculture in Congress Poland. In 1866 he was appointed as vice governor in Płock and in 1869 in Kielce. In 1891 he was appointed as deputy minister of justice, considered an expert on the &quot;peasant question&quot;.

Within a year he moved to the Ministry of the Interior, becoming Minister from 1895 to 1899. A self-described &quot;man of the old school&quot; who viewed the Tsar as the &quot;anointed one, the rightful sovereign&quot;, Goremykin was a loyal supporter of Nicholas II as autocrat and accordingly pursued conservative policy. He was apparently well liked by the Empress Alexandra (in 1894 he was appointed as senator; in 1896 as Actual Privy Councillor and became a member of the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society). In 1897 Vladimir Chertkov, a leading member of the Tolstoyan movement, was banned by Goremykin or his ministry.

While heading the Interior Ministry he submitted a proposal to the tsar advocating administrative reform and the expansion of the zemstvo program and representation within the existing zemstvos. Faced with opposition to the program, he left the position in 1899. In April 1906, Sergei Witte, a reformist, was succeeded by Goremykin. In the Russian Constitution of 1906 the tsar, regretting his &#x27;moment of weakness&#x27; when signing the October Manifesto, retained the title of autocrat and maintained his unique dominating position in relation to the Russian Church.
Goremykin&#x27;s unwavering opposition to the political reform demanded by the First Duma left him unable to work with that body and he resigned in July 1906 after a conflict about ministerial responsibility and rejecting radical agrarian reforms proposed by Duma. He was replaced by his Minister of Interior, the younger and more forceful Pyotr Stolypin.

Called back to service by the tsar, he again served as Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) from April 1914 to February 1916. Vladimir Kokovtsov was replaced by the decrepit and absent-minded Goremykin, and Pyotr Bark as Minister of Finance. Seventy-five years of age, a conservative, and a life-long bureaucrat, he was, in his own words, &#x27;pulled like a winter coat out of mothballs&#x27;, to lead the government. The hostility expressed toward him by members of both the State Duma and the Council of Ministers greatly impaired the effectiveness of his government. When Nicholas II decided to take direct command of the army, Goremykin and Alexander Krivoshein begged the tsar not to lead the army and leave the capital. All the ministers realized that the change would put the empress and Rasputin in charge and threatened to resign. Goremykin urged the Council to endorse the decision. When they refused, Goremykin told the tsar that he was not fitted and asked to be replaced with &quot;a man of more modern views&quot;. He held a hostile attitude towards the Imperial Duma and the Progressive Bloc. In January 1916 Rasputin was opposed to the plan to send the old Goremykin away, and he told Goremykin it was not right not to convene the Duma, as all were trying to cooperate; one must show them a little confidence. His wish for retirement was granted at the beginning of February 1916, when he was replaced by Boris Stürmer. Stürmer was not opposed to the convening of the Duma, as Goremykin had been, and he would launch more liberal and conciliatory policies.

After the February Revolution in 1917, he was arrested and interrogated before the &quot;Extraordinary Commission of Inquiry for the Investigation of Illegal Acts by Ministers and Other Responsible Persons of the Czarist Regime&quot;. In May Alexander Kerensky agreed to his release, on condition that he retired to his dacha in Sochi. On 24 December 1917 he was murdered in a robbery raid, together with his wife, his daughter, and father-in-law.

==Legacy==
Goremykin&#x27;s conservatism and inability to function in a semi-parliamentary system made him largely unsuitable for the position of head of government during the last years of Imperial Russia. Goremykin was despised by parliamentarians and revolutionaries and personally desired only to retire, and the ineffectiveness of his last government contributed to the instability and ultimate downfall of the Romanov dynasty.

==Quotations==

* &quot;The Emperor can&#x27;t see that the candles have already been lit around my coffin and that the only thing required to complete the ceremony is myself&quot; (commenting on his advanced age and unsuitability for office).
* &quot;To me, His Majesty is the anointed one, the rightful sovereign. He personifies the whole of Russia. He is forty-seven and it is not just since yesterday that he has been reigning and deciding the fate of the Russian people. When the decision of such a man is made and his course of action is determined, his faithful subjects must accept it whatever may be the consequences. And then let God&#x27;s will be fulfilled. These views I have held all my life and with them I shall die.&quot;

<text>Henrietta &quot;Hetty&quot; Howland Robinson Green (November 21, 1834 – July 3, 1916) was an American businesswoman and financier known as &quot;the richest woman in America&quot; during the Gilded Age. Those who knew her well referred to her admiringly as the &quot;Queen of Wall Street&quot; due to her willingness to lend freely and at reasonable interest rates to financiers and city governments during financial panics. Her extraordinary discipline during such times enabled her to amass a fortune as a financier at a time when nearly all major financiers were men. 

As a highly successful investor, with a Wall Street office, she was unusual for being a woman in a man&#x27;s world. Unwilling to participate in New York City high society, conspicuous consumption, or business partnerships, she may have been eccentric and curt with the press but she was a pioneer of value investing. Her willingness to make low-rate loans (with her well-tended reserves of currency) in place of the failing banks during the Panic of 1907 helped bail out Wall Street, New York City, and the United States economy. Nonetheless, she was seen in her widowhood as an odd miser all in black, sometimes referred to sensationally as the &quot;Witch of Wall Street&quot;, and later the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; even named her the &quot;greatest miser,&quot; for a time. Stories that were often cited include her refusal to buy expensive clothes or pay for hot water, and her habit of wearing a single dress that was replaced only when it was worn out. Later evaluations have seen her as perhaps eccentric, but mostly out-of-step with the excesses of the Gilded Age wealthy, and the contemporary expectations for women, especially of her class.

==Birth and early years==

=== Early childhood ===
Henrietta (&quot;Hetty&quot;) Howland Robinson was born in 1834 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, the daughter of Edward Mott Robinson and Abby Howland, the richest whaling family in the city. Her family members were Quakers who owned a large whaling fleet and also profited from the China trade. She had a younger brother who died as an infant.

At the age of two, Green was sent to live with her grandfather, Gideon Howland, and her Aunt Sylvia. Green would read the stock quotations and commerce reports for her grandfather and picked up some of his business methods. At the age of 10, she entered Eliza Wing&#x27;s boarding school in Sandwich. Green&#x27;s father became the head of the Isaac Howland whaling firm upon Gideon&#x27;s death, and she began to emulate her father&#x27;s business practices. Because of Gideon&#x27;s influence and that of her father, and possibly because her mother was constantly ill, she was close to her father and was reading financial papers to him by the age of six. Green learned to read ledgers and trade commodities. When she was 13, Green became the family bookkeeper. She accompanied her father to the countinghouses, storerooms, commodities traders, and stockbrokers. In the evening, she read him the news.

=== Early adulthood ===
In her late teens, Green attended multiple boarding schools and finishing schools, such as the Friends Academy and Anna Cabot Lowell&#x27;s finishing school. Simultaneously, she assisted her father with the management of the family business. The unifying theme throughout this period of her life was her unapologetic rejection of societal norms established for women at the time — especially wealthy heiresses. Green cared little for her appearance, preferring to dress in old clothes, and she disregarded the daily primping practiced by young women. Green&#x27;s behavior frustrated her mother and Aunt Sylvia because they feared what the future would hold for a wealthy heiress who felt more at home on the docks of New Bedford than mingling with members of her class.

When Green turned 20 years old, her Aunt Sylvia pressured her to find a spouse. Reluctantly, Green moved to New York to live with a cousin of her mother&#x27;s, Henry Grinnell. During her time in New York, she mingled with the upper crust of New York society and attended many lavish balls but she expressed little interest in finding a husband. Instead, she spent much of her time eavesdropping on men as they discussed the latest Wall Street dramas. Her relatives were exasperated when she returned several months early to New Bedford with no wedding prospects. Her father was the only person unable to contain his delight when he learned that Green had spent only $200 out of her $1,200 budget, investing the remainder in high-quality bonds.

=== Adulthood and marriage ===
Within a few years of her return to New Bedford, Green&#x27;s father exited the whaling business and relocated to New York City. His exit was well-timed, as the use of petroleum virtually eliminated the demand for whale oil within a few years. Green spent the next six years shuttling between New York City and New Bedford. Her priority in New York was assisting her father with new business and investment activities, while her priority in New Bedford was pestering her Aunt Sylvia to ensure that she remained the sole beneficiary of her will. The constant fights over Aunt Sylvia&#x27;s will led to a drawn-out court battle, which haunted Green for the remainder of her life. Green&#x27;s mother, Abby Robinson, died on February 21, 1860, but her $100,000 estate went to her husband, except for an $8,000 () house for Green.

While residing in New York City, Hetty met her future husband, Edward Henry Green of Vermont. By the age of 44, Edward was a partner in Russell Sturgis &amp; Company and had become a millionaire in his own right from his business endeavors in the Far East. Her father encouraged their marriage but with the clear stipulation that Edward Green would not inherit Hetty&#x27;s money. Specifically, the will stated that it was to be &quot;free from the debts, control or interference of any such husband.&quot; With Hetty&#x27;s inheritance safe, her father encouraged the marriage, as he was concerned with his declining health and about Hetty&#x27;s ability to manage the family business in his absence.

In May 1865, Hetty and Edward announced their engagement, but soon thereafter, both Hetty&#x27;s father and Aunt Silvia died. Although Hetty was the primary beneficiary on both estates, most of the assets were placed into trust, entitling Hetty only to the income. Robinson&#x27;s estate was estimated to be $6 million, but all but $1 million was placed in a trust that entitled Hetty only to the income. Sylvia Howland had willed half of her $2 million estate to charities and entities in the town of New Bedford; the rest was placed in a trust for Hetty, but once again without her control of the principal. This enraged Hetty because she believed that she could invest the assets more effectively and at a much lower cost – a claim she later proved beyond any shadow of a doubt.

Green was especially angered by Sylvia&#x27;s will, and she initiated a drawn-out court case disputing its legitimacy. The executor of Howland&#x27;s will, Thomas Mandell, rejected Hetty&#x27;s claim that an addendum to the will granted almost the entire estate to her. Mandell claimed that the addendum was a forgery, and it was challenged in court. The case, &quot;Robinson v. Mandell&quot;, remains notable as an early example of the forensic use of mathematics. The case was ultimately decided against Robinson after the court ruled that the addendum and signature were forgeries. Hetty settled the case for a smaller percentage of the estate (approximately $600,000), which was placed in trust.

Exhausted from lawsuits and concerned about an effort by Hetty&#x27;s cousins to have her indicted for forgery based on the &quot;Robinson v. Mandell&quot; decision, the couple moved overseas to London, where they lived in the Langham Hotel. The Greens departed the U.S. for London soon after their wedding on July 11, 1867. Their two children, Edward Howland Robinson Green (called Ned) and Harriet Sylvia Ann Howland Green Wilks (called Sylvia), were born in London: Ned on August 23, 1868, and Sylvia on January 7, 1871.

==Investing career==
Green followed a contrarian investing strategy, in her words, &quot;I buy when things are low and nobody wants them. I keep them until they go up and people are crazy to get them. That is, I believe, the secret of all successful business.&quot; Green invested the interest from her father&#x27;s trust fund, once again investing as her father had done, in Civil War bonds, which paid a high yield in gold, augmented by railroad stocks. Her annual profits during her first year in London amounted to $1.25 million, and the most she ever earned in a day was $200,000. Green went on to say, &quot;I believe in getting in at the bottom and out on top. I like to buy railroad stocks or mortgage bonds. When I see a good thing going cheap because nobody wants it, I buy a lot of it and tuck it away.&quot; Her investment strategy could perhaps be best described as a &quot;buy low, sell high&quot; position. Hetty&#x27;s discounted greenbacks, bought during the Civil War, were increased in value when Congress passed legislation in 1875 backing them with gold. As Hetty said of her investing philosophy, &quot;Before deciding on an investment, I seek out every kind of information about it.&quot;

When the Green family returned to the United States in October 1873, after Edward suffered losses on Wall Street, they settled in Edward&#x27;s hometown of Bellows Falls, Vermont. Hetty quarreled with Edward&#x27;s mother until she died in 1875. That same year, Hetty covered Edward&#x27;s losses associated with the London and San Francisco Bank, of which he was one of the directors. Hetty bailed Edward out once again in 1884.

After the 1885 collapse of the financial house John J. Cisco &amp; Son, of which Edward was a partner, it was disclosed Edward had $700,000 in debt. Hetty Green&#x27;s $500,000 represented one-quarter of the bank&#x27;s assets. The bank refused to allow her to transfer her $26 million in stocks, bonds, mortgages, and deeds to the Chemical National Bank until Edward&#x27;s debt was paid. In the end, Hetty made the transfer and paid off her husband&#x27;s debt, but never forgave Edward.

Green set up an office in the Chemical Bank but continued to live in boarding houses, flats, or hotels. By then she was known as the &quot;Queen of Wall Street.&quot; Her investing philosophy, in her words, included, &quot;In business generally, don&#x27;t close a bargain until you have reflected on it overnight.&quot; She also thought, &quot;It is the duty of every woman, I believe, to learn to take care of her own business affairs,&quot; and &quot;A girl should be brought up as to be able to make her own living...&quot; &quot;Whether rich or poor, a young woman should know how a bank account works, understand the composition of mortgages and bonds, and know the value of interest and how it accumulates.&quot;

The Panic of 1907 provided an opportunity for Green to showcase many of the investment skills that she had accumulated over several decades. Unlike most Wall Street financiers, Green predicted the panic long before its arrival. She explained her foresight, stating, “I saw this situation developing three years ago, and I am on record as predicting it. I said the rich were approaching the brink, and that a ‘panic’ was inevitable.“ For several years before the panic, Green amassed a large cash position. When the panic arrived in October 1907, Green lent liberally to financiers and the City of New York to get them through the crisis. She was also the only woman invited to the critical meeting with J. Pierpont Morgan and the leading banking executives at the height of the crisis.

===Investment strategy===
Green conducted much of her business at the offices of the Seaboard National Bank in New York, surrounded by trunks and suitcases full of her papers; she did not want to pay rent for her own office. Possibly because of her usually dour dress (due mainly to frugality, but perhaps in part related to her Quaker upbringing), she was given the nickname &quot;the Witch of Wall Street&quot;.

Green was a successful businesswoman who dealt mainly in real estate, invested in railroads and mines and lent money while acquiring numerous mortgages. The City of New York came to Green for loans to keep the city afloat on several occasions, most particularly during the Panic of 1907; she wrote a check for $1.1 million and took her payment in short-term revenue bonds. Keenly detail-oriented, she would travel thousands of miles alone—in an era when few women would dare travel unescorted—to collect a debt of a few hundred dollars.

Ken Fisher discusses Green in his 2007 book &quot;100 Minds That Made the Market&quot;. Fisher argues that despite her eccentricities, Green was in many ways a better investor than most of her early Wall Street contemporaries. Green clearly understood the power of compound interest, and her focus on regular modest gains of 6% a year and frugal living made her fortune more durable than the likes of Jesse Livermore who repeatedly earned larger sums on more extravagant deals but also went bankrupt through excessive spending and high-risk investments.

==Reputation==
===Thrift===
The Gilded Age was an era known for its excesses in spending on material goods, and she was among the few prominent investors who chose not to partake. Indeed, she was known for being frugal or stingy with her money. Journalists of her time often presented her thriftiness as evidence of her miserliness, when in fact it played an important role in her investing strategy. Examples of negative media portrayals included reports that she never turned on the heat or used hot water. She was also known for wearing a single black dress that she would not replace until it was thoroughly worn out. Moreover, she reportedly instructed her laundress to wash only the dirtiest parts of her dresses (the hems) to save money on soap. The harshest accusation, however, was that she neglected treating her son&#x27;s injured leg, which eventually resulted in an amputation. The evidence cited was her refusal to pay for a visit to a single physician. However, there is substantial evidence that Green put great expense and effort to treat her son. This included visits to multiple specialists, as well as temporarily relocating her residence so that she could care for him.

Green&#x27;s personal perspective on thrift differed markedly from that of the public. There is evidence that her frugality was passed down from her father, who was also a successful investor. She once explained her thrift by recounting an explanation her father gave after he rejected an expensive cigar that was offered to him, “I smoke four cent cigars and I like them. If I were to smoke better ones, I might lose my taste for the cheap ones that I now find quite satisfactory.” 

Green&#x27;s thrift also reflected her Quaker upbringing, which featured an emphasis on plain clothing among other characteristics. When a reporter questioned why she had spent so little time during a visit to an expensive hotel, she responded &quot;Young man, I am a Quaker, and I am trying to live up to the tenets of that faith. That is why I dress plainly and live quietly. No other kind of life would please me.&quot; Finally, Green’s thrift was essential to her investment strategy, as it enabled her to buy assets confidently amid financial panics because it prepared her to live on minimal expenses.

===Media portrayal===
Green was often portrayed negatively in the media. Yet her investment strategy shunned the nefarious tactics that were commonly used by Wall Street speculators such as Daniel Drew, Jay Gould, and Jim Fisk. She once commented on this misperception: 

It has turned out...that my life is written for me down in Wall Street by people who, I assume, do not care to know one iota of the real Hetty Green. I am in earnest; therefore they picture [me] as heartless. I go my own way, take no partners, risk nobody else&#x27;s fortune, therefore I am Madame Ishmael, set against every man.
She was a secret philanthropist, avoiding the attention of the press, stating, &quot;I believe in discreet charity.&quot; Green also had the reputation of being an effective nurse, caring for her children and old neighbors. Her favorite poem was William Henry Channing&#x27;s &quot;My Symphony&quot;, which starts with &quot;To live content with small means...&quot;

Despite the strength of her ethics relative to her peers, Green entered the lexicon of turn-of-the-century America with the popular phrase &quot;I&#x27;m not Hetty if I do look green.&quot; O. Henry used this phrase in his 1890s story &quot;The Skylight Room&quot;, in which a young woman, negotiating the rent on a room in a rooming house owned by an imperious old lady, wishes to make it clear she is neither as rich as she appears nor as naive.

==Later life==
As a young man, Ned Green moved away from his mother to manage the family&#x27;s properties in Chicago and, later, Texas. In middle age, he returned to New York; his mother lived her final months with him.

Green&#x27;s daughter Sylvia lived with her mother until her thirties. Green disapproved of all of her daughter&#x27;s suitors, suspecting that they were after her fortune. Sylvia finally married Matthew Astor Wilks on February 23, 1909, after a two-year courtship. A minor heir to the Astor fortune, Wilks entered the marriage with $2 million of his own, enough to assure Green that he was not a gold digger. Nonetheless, she compelled him to sign a prenuptial agreement waiving his right to inherit Sylvia&#x27;s fortune.

When her grown children left home, Green moved repeatedly among small apartments in Brooklyn Heights and after 1898, in Hoboken, New Jersey, mainly to avoid New York&#x27;s property tax, though she did loan money to the city at reasonable rates. She then regularly commuted to her office in the Chemical Bank on Broadway. By 1905, Green was New York&#x27;s largest lender. Unsubstantiated rumors claimed that she ate only oatmeal, eggs, and onions, unheated so as not to increase her fuel bill.

In her old age, Green developed a hernia, but refused to have an operation, preferring to use a stick to press down the swelling. She eventually moved her office to the National Park Bank, when she thought she had been poisoned at the Chemical Bank, a fear she had most of her life.

==Death and legacy==
On July 3, 1916, Green died at age 81 at her son&#x27;s New York City home. According to her longstanding &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Miser&quot; entry in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, she died of apoplexy after arguing with a maid over the virtues of skimmed milk. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported she suffered a series of strokes leading up to her death.

Upon her death, Green was known as the &quot;Wizard of Finance&quot; and the &quot;Richest Woman in America.&quot; Estimates of her net worth ranged from $100 million to $200 million (equivalent to $2.7 billion to $5.4 billion in 2024), making her arguably the richest woman in the world at the time.

Two days after her death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; paid tribute to Green:

It was that Mrs. Green was a woman that made her career the subject of endless curiosity, comment, and astonishment...Her habits were the legacy of New England ancestors who had the best of reasons for knowing &quot;the value of money,&quot; for never wasting it, and for risking it only when their shrewd minds saw an approach to certainty of profit. Though something of hardness was ascribed to her, that she harmed any is not recorded, and victims of ruthlessness are usually audible...That there are few like her is not a cause of regret; that there are many less commendable, is one. 

Green was buried at the Immanuel Cemetery at the Immanuel Episcopal Church in Bellows Falls, Vermont, next to her husband. She had converted late in life to his Episcopalian faith so that she could be interred with him. Their two children split her estate, which included a ten-year trust for Sylvia administered by Ned. Sylvia died in 1951, leaving an estimated $200 million and donating all but $1,388,000 to 64 colleges, churches, hospitals, and other charities. Both children were buried near their parents in Bellows Falls.

Green&#x27;s former mansion in Englewood, New Jersey was purchased by the Actors Fund in 1928 and currently houses the Lillian Booth Actors Home.

==In popular culture==
Green is mentioned in George M. Cohan&#x27;s song &quot;Then I&#x27;d Be Satisfied With Life&quot;. She is also mentioned in The Decemberists&#x27;s &quot;Calamity Song.&quot;

&quot;The She-Wolf&quot; (1931) and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Buy Everything&quot; (1934) are films about miserly billionaire businesswomen based on Green and played by Australian-born actress May Robson.

King of the Hill (2004) S8S8 &quot;Rich Hank, Poor Hank&quot; 
Connie mentions Green by saying that extremely wealthy people who are also cheap, often have a mental illness.

<text>Fontana Records is a record label that was started in the 1950s as a subsidiary of the Dutch Philips Records. The independent label distributor Fontana Distribution takes its name from the label.

==History==
Fontana started in the 1950s as a subsidiary of the Dutch Philips Records; when Philips restructured its music operations, it dropped Fontana in favor of Vertigo Records.
Fontana&#x27;s U.S. counterpart label was started in 1964 and distributed by Philips US subsidiary Mercury Records. The initial single release (F 1501) was a wild teen beat instrumental by famed British session drummer Bobby Graham, both sides featuring Jimmy Page on guitar. Among the hitmakers were Wayne Fontana &amp; the Mindbenders (then later on their own, simply as the Mindbenders), the Troggs, the New Vaudeville Band, Manfred Mann, Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick &amp; Tich, and Steam. 

In 2009 the label released Brooke Hogan&#x27;s album.

==US label variations==
*1964—Pink label
*1965-1970—Light blue or slightly darker-toned blue label (some of these labels were stamped with an &quot;S&quot;)

<doc id="336348" wikidata="Q1251139" url="?curid=336348" title="Dot Records">
<text>Dot Records was an American record label founded by Randy Wood and Gene Nobles that was active between 1950 and 1978. The original headquarters of Dot Records were in Gallatin, Tennessee. In its early years, Dot specialized in artists from Tennessee. Then it branched out to include musicians from across the U.S. It recorded country music, rhythm and blues, polkas, waltzes, gospel, rockabilly, pop, and early rock and roll.

After moving to Hollywood in 1956, Dot Records bought many recordings by small local independent labels and issued them nationally. In 1957, Wood sold the label to Paramount Pictures, but remained in charge until 1967, when he departed to join Lawrence Welk in the formation of Ranwood Records.

In 1968, the label was acquired as part of the acquisition of Paramount by Gulf+Western, which transitioned it to recording exclusively country music and placed it under the management of Famous Music in 1971. Gulf+Western sold its labels to ABC in 1974. Dot was renamed to ABC-Dot Records before closing in 1978.

The label was reactivated in 2014 through a joint venture between Big Machine Label Group and the Republic Records unit of Universal Music Group (which owns the original Dot Records catalog). Based in Nashville, Tennessee, the label was retired in 2017.

==History==
===Early years===
Dot&#x27;s founder, Randy Wood, a veteran of the Army during World War II, settled in Gallatin, Tennessee. There he started an appliance store named Randy&#x27;s, and began carrying records as an afterthought in 1947. Wood initially carried records in the classical and popular genres, but found his customers were asking for records of such rhythm and blues artists as Joe Liggins, Roosevelt Sykes, and Cecil Gant. They were staples of the playlist of Nashville&#x27;s CBS Radio affiliate, WLAC.

After discovering that their records were only available in limited quantities—and not in Gallatin—Wood formed a mail-order operation by placing a short advertisement with WLAC personalities &quot;Hoss&quot; Allen and Gene Nobles. By 1950, his record sales had far surpassed that of the appliances he carried and he renamed his store Randy&#x27;s Record Shop. As an extension, he formed a label named Randy&#x27;s, which released &quot;Gene Nobles&#x27; Boogie&quot; by Richard Armstrong, and Record Shop Special, which had Gant on its roster.

After Wood purchased local radio station WHIN, he and Nobles formed Dot, a more widely distributed label, whose first headquarters were in that station&#x27;s building. Since WHIN broadcast only in the daytime, recording sessions were at night when the station was off the air.

One of the first artists he recorded was the young Johnny Maddox, who packed records for him at his store, and whose honky tonk piano style graced Dot Records for almost twenty years. Wood&#x27;s roster of R&amp;B artists included Ivory Joe Hunter, Joe Liggins, the Four Dots, the Big Three Trio, Brownie McGhee, Shorty Long, the Counts, and the Griffin Brothers, who had a number one R&amp;B hit with &quot;Weepin&#x27; &amp; Cryin&#x27;&quot; (with vocal by Tommy Brown) in 1951. His country artists included Mac Wiseman, who had hits with &quot;The Ballad of Davy Crockett&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Brown the Newsboy&quot;, and, more famously, Jimmy &quot;C.&quot; Newman, who scored many hits on the label (the biggest being &quot;Cry, Cry, Darling&quot;) before leaving for MGM Records in 1958. Wood also recorded such gospel artists as the Fairfield 4, the Gateway Quartet, the Golden Voice Trio, Rosa Shaw, Joe Warren, the Singing Stars, and the Brewsteraires.

Dot&#x27;s first major pop act was The Hilltoppers, whose hits included &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; and &quot;Trying&quot;; when lead singer Billy Vaughn hit #2 with a revival of Wayne King&#x27;s &quot;Melody of Love&quot;, he left the group to become the label&#x27;s main musical director.

Wood, seeing the demand for rhythm and blues recordings among white audiences, in 1955, hired a number of vocalists to do pop-oriented covers of tunes popular in the genre. The most notable artist who performed that function for Dot was Pat Boone, who outsold the original recordings of the Charms&#x27; &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t It a Shame&quot; (which was changed to the slightly more grammatically correct &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot;), the Five Keys&#x27; &quot;Gee Whittakers!&quot;, Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; and &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;, the El Dorados&#x27; &quot;At My Front Door&quot;, and Ivory Joe Hunter&#x27;s &quot;I Almost Lost My Mind&quot;. Boone in the late spring of 1956 opted to switch to original material in the Bing Crosby/Frank Sinatra tradition.

Other notable artists who did R&amp;B covers for Dot included the Fontane Sisters (who covered the Jewels&#x27; &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot;, the Teen Queens&#x27; &quot;Eddie My Love&quot;, the Drifters&#x27; &quot;Adorable&quot;, the Marigolds&#x27; &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;, and Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Leave Me&quot;), Snooky Lanson (with covers of the Jacks&#x27; &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Write Me&quot; and the Dream Weavers&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s Almost Tomorrow&quot;), and actress Gale Storm (with covers of Frankie Lymon&#x27;s &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; and Smiley Lewis&#x27; &quot;I Hear You Knocking&quot;. (This last was revived by Dave Edmunds in 1970).

In 1956, Dot also made a noteworthy contribution to the Easy Listening genre by releasing a recording of popular music arranged by John Serry (&quot;Squeeze Play&quot;, DLP-3024, 1956).

===Paramount years===

In late 1956, Wood signed Warner Bros. star Tab Hunter to a record contract after Chicago disc jockey Howard Miller suggested to Wood that he might want to sign Hunter, who was enormously popular and had just packed a stage show in Chicago with screaming girls. Wood asked if Hunter could sing, but Miller replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, it doesn&#x27;t matter, I guess.&quot; Tab Hunter was the first to tell Wood that he could not sing a note. However, after giving Hunter the Ric Cartey tune &quot;Young Love&quot;, Wood told producer Milt Rogers to repeatedly teach Hunter how to sing it until he finally reached the point where he could. The record topped the charts in 1957; Dot&#x27;s release of a follow-up record from Hunter (&quot;Ninety-Nine Ways&quot;) frustrated Warner Bros. chief Jack L. Warner, who retaliated by forming Warner Bros. Records and placing Hunter on the label as its first artist.

In 1957, Wood sold the label to Paramount Pictures, but he remained president for another decade. Dot (and Wood) then moved to Hollywood, where the label began to release soundtrack albums, including Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s score for &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), a 2-LP set that played longer than the usual record album.

Remakes were commonplace at Dot in the 1960s, with the label having artists such as Tony Martin, Jo Stafford, Vaughn Monroe, Gene Austin, Jimmie Rodgers, the Andrews Sisters, Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher re-record their old hits at various times; in 1968, Dot issued a various-artists album devoted to remakes of these artists&#x27; million-sellers.

During the late 1950s and 1960s, Wood would re-enter the rock and roll market by licensing material from independent producers. Most of his acquisitions charted and became major hits, including leases of Sanford Clark&#x27;s &quot;The Fool&quot; from producer Lee Hazlewood, Bonnie Guitar&#x27;s &quot;Dark Moon&quot; from Fabor Records, the Del-Vikings&#x27; &quot;Come Go with Me&quot; from Fee-Bee Records, Jimmie Dee and the Offbeats&#x27; &quot;Henrietta&quot; from Bob Tanner&#x27;s TNT Records, Robin Luke&#x27;s &quot;Susie Darlin&#x27;&quot; from Bertram International Records, Lonnie Donegan&#x27;s &quot;Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour (On the Bedpost Overnight?)&quot; from Pye Records, the Chantays&#x27; &quot;Pipeline&quot; from Downey Records, the Surfaris&#x27; &quot;Wipe Out&quot; from the Princess label, and the Fireballs&#x27; &quot;Sugar Shack&quot; from producer Norman Petty. The label&#x27;s success on the pop charts would be negatively impacted by the success of The Beatles and the subsequent British Invasion, and there were times, between 1964 and 1967, when it could not place a song on the Billboard Hot 100 or the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart or both of the two charts.

Pat Boone had further success in the 1960s, registering a #1 hit in 1961 with &quot;Moody River&quot;, then coming back in 1962 with a #6 hit with &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot;. He was one of the Big Three Dot album sellers of the 1960s, along with Billy Vaughn and Lawrence Welk, whose orchestra members, such as Myron Floren, Jo Ann Castle, Joe Feeney and Bob Ralston, released records alongside him in the 1960s. Welk and Vaughn in particular regularly appeared in the album top-twenty. Johnny Maddox, banjo player Eddie Peabody, Steve Allen, Louis Prima, Keely Smith, the Mills Brothers and organists Eddie Baxter and George Wright made many albums for Dot as well. Known for artist loyalty, many of these artists stayed with Dot for over a decade, partly because Wood had a reputation for fairmindedness. His label was not impacted by any of the record industry scandals of the 1950s and Wood told a 1959 congressional hearing on payola that his books were open.

Hamilton Records, a subsidiary, was founded in 1958 for rockabilly and rhythm &amp; blues. It also functioned as a venue for albums by their regular roster of artists that could be retailed for $1.98, since all or most of the material featured on them was in the public domain, thereby obviating the need to pay song royalties. It distributed Steed Records and the only two records from Carnival, owned by Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss. Two other subsidiary labels were created: Crystalette Records and Acta Records. In 1967, Dot picked up distribution of DynoVoice, owned by Bob Crewe, from Bell Records. Later in 1967, Randy Wood left Dot to found Ranwood Records with Welk.

===Country music label===
Two years after Paramount was purchased by Gulf and Western in 1968, Dot was rebranded as a country music label, a move which revitalized the label&#x27;s chart presence, albeit on the Hot Country Songs chart instead of the Hot 100. Country artists on the label included Freddy Fender, Roy Clark, Barbara Mandrell, Billy &quot;Crash&quot; Craddock, Narvel Felts, the Oak Ridge Boys, Don Williams, Tommy Overstreet, John Wesley Ryles, Johnny Carver, Donna Fargo, Red Steagall, Ray Price, Joe Stampley, Buck Trent, Sue Richards, Eddy Raven, Diana Trask, Ray Griff, Ray Pillow, Doug Sahm (formerly of the Sir Douglas Quintet), Joe Barry, and Freddy Weller (formerly of Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders). During the transition, Dot&#x27;s pop back catalog was deleted and was transferred to the newly founded Paramount label.

In 1971, Gulf and Western placed Dot under the umbrella of the Famous Music Group, which included Paramount Records, Stax (until 1970), and Blue Thumb, with distribution of Sire (now owned by Warner Music Group) and Neighborhood, originally owned by Melanie Safka. By 1968, Lawrence Welk had acquired his portion of the Dot back catalog and subsequently reissued the material on his own Ranwood label.

With the rest of the Famous Music Group, in 1974, Dot was bought by ABC, which had tried to purchase the label years before, and renamed it to ABC/Dot Records, a name it retained before the label was discontinued at the start of 1978. The ABC/Dot headquarters became the Nashville office of ABC Records.

ABC Records was then sold to MCA Records in 1979. MCA&#x27;s Nashville division briefly revived the Dot label in 1985–86 for a series of one-off albums by country music artists such as Jan Howard, Jeanne Pruett, Jim Ed Brown and the Browns, Carl Perkins, Billie Jo Spears, Porter Wagoner, and Tompall Glaser.

The merger of the MCA Records and PolyGram Records families became the foundation for Universal Music Group in 1999. Currently, the Dot pop music catalog is managed by Universal Music&#x27;s Geffen Records. The country back catalog is managed by the former Decca and Coral unit, which was rebranded as MCA Nashville, except for those by Roy Clark and Hank Thompson (owned by their respective estates).

Randy Wood died at age 94 in his La Jolla, California, home on April 9, 2011, from complications after a fall.

===Revival===
Big Machine Records revived the Dot Records name for a new label in March 2014. The label&#x27;s first signees included Maddie and Tae, Drake White, and Steven Tyler. Big Machine discontinued the label in 2017.

<doc id="336349" wikidata="Q1764362" url="?curid=336349" title="Egyptian fraction">
<text>An Egyptian fraction is a finite sum of distinct unit fractions, such as
formula_1
That is, each fraction in the expression has a numerator equal to 1 and a denominator that is a positive integer, and all the denominators differ from each other. The value of an expression of this type is a positive rational number formula_2; for instance the Egyptian fraction above sums to formula_3. Every positive rational number can be represented by an Egyptian fraction. Sums of this type, and similar sums also including formula_4 and formula_5 as summands, were used as a serious notation for rational numbers by the ancient Egyptians, and continued to be used by other civilizations into medieval times. In modern mathematical notation, Egyptian fractions have been superseded by vulgar fractions and decimal notation. However, Egyptian fractions continue to be an object of study in modern number theory and recreational mathematics, as well as in modern historical studies of ancient mathematics.

== Applications ==
Beyond their historical use, Egyptian fractions have some practical advantages over other representations of fractional numbers.
For instance, Egyptian fractions can help in dividing food or other objects into equal shares. For example, if one wants to divide 5 pizzas equally among 8 diners, the Egyptian fraction
formula_6
means that each diner gets half a pizza plus another eighth of a pizza, for example by splitting 4 pizzas into 8 halves, and the remaining pizza into 8 eighths. Exercises in performing this sort of fair division of food are a standard classroom example in teaching students to work with unit fractions.

Egyptian fractions can provide a solution to rope-burning puzzles, in which a given duration is to be measured by igniting non-uniform ropes which burn out after a unit time. Any rational fraction of a unit of time can be measured by expanding the fraction into a sum of unit fractions and then, for each unit fraction formula_7, burning a rope so that it always has formula_8 simultaneously lit points where it is burning. For this application, it is not necessary for the unit fractions to be distinct from each other. However, this solution may need an infinite number of re-lighting steps.

== Early history ==

Egyptian fraction notation was developed in the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. Five early texts in which Egyptian fractions appear were the Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll, the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus, the Reisner Papyrus, the Kahun Papyrus and the Akhmim Wooden Tablet. A later text, the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, introduced improved ways of writing Egyptian fractions. The Rhind papyrus was written by Ahmes and dates from the Second Intermediate Period; it includes a table of Egyptian fraction expansions for rational numbers formula_9, as well as 84 word problems. Solutions to each problem were written out in scribal shorthand, with the final answers of all 84 problems being expressed in Egyptian fraction notation. Tables of expansions for formula_9 similar to the one on the Rhind papyrus also appear on some of the other texts. However, as the Kahun Papyrus shows, vulgar fractions were also used by scribes within their calculations.

=== Notation ===
To write the unit fractions used in their Egyptian fraction notation, in hieroglyph script, the Egyptians placed the hieroglyph:
(&quot;er&quot;, &quot;[one] among&quot; or possibly &quot;re&quot;, mouth) above a number to represent the reciprocal of that number. Similarly in hieratic script they drew a line over the letter representing the number. For example:

The Egyptians had special symbols for formula_11, formula_4, and formula_5 that were used to reduce the size of numbers greater than formula_11 when such numbers were converted to an Egyptian fraction series. The remaining number after subtracting one of these special fractions was written as a sum of distinct unit fractions according to the usual Egyptian fraction notation.
The Egyptians also used an alternative notation modified from the Old Kingdom to denote a special set of fractions of the form formula_15 (for formula_16) and sums of these numbers, which are necessarily dyadic rational numbers. These have been called &quot;Horus-Eye fractions&quot; after a theory (now discredited) that they were based on the parts of the Eye of Horus symbol.
They were used in the Middle Kingdom in conjunction with the later notation for Egyptian fractions to subdivide a hekat, the primary ancient Egyptian volume measure for grain, bread, and other small quantities of volume, as described in the Akhmim Wooden Tablet. If any remainder was left after expressing a quantity in Eye of Horus fractions of a hekat, the remainder was written using the usual Egyptian fraction notation as multiples of a &quot;ro&quot;, a unit equal to formula_17 of a hekat.

=== Calculation methods ===
Modern historians of mathematics have studied the Rhind papyrus and other ancient sources in an attempt to discover the methods the Egyptians used in calculating with Egyptian fractions. In particular, study in this area has concentrated on understanding the tables of expansions for numbers of the form formula_9 in the Rhind papyrus. Although these expansions can generally be described as algebraic identities, the methods used by the Egyptians may not correspond directly to these identities. Additionally, the expansions in the table do not match any single identity; rather, different identities match the expansions for prime and for composite denominators, and more than one identity fits the numbers of each type:

* For small odd prime denominators formula_19, the expansion formula_20 was used.
* For larger prime denominators, an expansion of the form formula_21 was used, where formula_22 is a number with many divisors (such as a practical number) between formula_23 and formula_19. The remaining term formula_25 was expanded by representing the number formula_26 as a sum of divisors of formula_22 and forming a fraction formula_28 for each such divisor formula_29 in this sum. As an example, Ahmes&#x27; expansion formula_30 fits this pattern with formula_31 and formula_32, as formula_33 and formula_34. There may be many different expansions of this type for a given formula_19; however, as K. S. Brown observed, the expansion chosen by the Egyptians was often the one that caused the largest denominator to be as small as possible, among all expansions fitting this pattern.
* For some composite denominators, factored as formula_36, the expansion for formula_37 has the form of an expansion for formula_38 with each denominator multiplied by formula_39. This method appears to have been used for many of the composite numbers in the Rhind papyrus, but there are exceptions, notably formula_40, formula_41, and formula_42.
* One can also expand formula_43 For instance, Ahmes expands formula_44. Later scribes used a more general form of this expansion, formula_45 which works when formula_46 is a multiple of formula_47.
* The final (prime) expansion in the Rhind papyrus, formula_48, does not fit any of these forms, but instead uses an expansion formula_49 that may be applied regardless of the value of formula_19. That is, formula_51. A related expansion was also used in the Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll for several cases.

== Later usage ==
Egyptian fraction notation continued to be used in Greek times and into the Middle Ages, despite complaints as early as Ptolemy&#x27;s Almagest about the clumsiness of the notation compared to alternatives such as the Babylonian base-60 notation. Related problems of decomposition into unit fractions were also studied in 9th-century India by Jain mathematician Mahāvīra. An important text of medieval European mathematics, the &quot;Liber Abaci&quot; (1202) of Leonardo of Pisa (more commonly known as Fibonacci), provides some insight into the uses of Egyptian fractions in the Middle Ages, and introduces topics that continue to be important in modern mathematical study of these series.

The primary subject of the &quot;Liber Abaci&quot; is calculations involving decimal and vulgar fraction notation, which eventually replaced Egyptian fractions. Fibonacci himself used a complex notation for fractions involving a combination of a mixed radix notation with sums of fractions. Many of the calculations throughout Fibonacci&#x27;s book involve numbers represented as Egyptian fractions, and one section of this book provides a list of methods for conversion of vulgar fractions to Egyptian fractions. If the number is not already a unit fraction, the first method in this list is to attempt to split the numerator into a sum of divisors of the denominator; this is possible whenever the denominator is a practical number, and &quot;Liber Abaci&quot; includes tables of expansions of this type for the practical numbers 6, 8, 12, 20, 24, 60, and 100.

The next several methods involve algebraic identities such as
formula_52
For instance, Fibonacci represents the fraction by splitting the numerator into a sum of two numbers, each of which divides one plus the denominator: . Fibonacci applies the algebraic identity above to each these two parts, producing the expansion . Fibonacci describes similar methods for denominators that are two or three less than a number with many factors.

In the rare case that these other methods all fail, Fibonacci suggests a &quot;greedy&quot; algorithm for computing Egyptian fractions, in which one repeatedly chooses the unit fraction with the smallest denominator that is no larger than the remaining fraction to be expanded: that is, in more modern notation, we replace a fraction by the expansion
formula_53
where represents the ceiling function; since , this method yields a finite expansion.

Fibonacci suggests switching to another method after the first such expansion, but he also gives examples in which this greedy expansion was iterated until a complete Egyptian fraction expansion was constructed: and .

Compared to ancient Egyptian expansions or to more modern methods, this method may produce expansions that are quite long, with large denominators, and Fibonacci himself noted the awkwardness of the expansions produced by this method. For instance, the greedy method expands
formula_54
while other methods lead to the shorter expansion
formula_55

Sylvester&#x27;s sequence 2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, ... can be viewed as generated by an infinite greedy expansion of this type for the number 1, where at each step we choose the denominator instead of , and sometimes Fibonacci&#x27;s greedy algorithm is attributed to James Joseph Sylvester.

After his description of the greedy algorithm, Fibonacci suggests yet another method, expanding a fraction by searching for a number &quot;c&quot; having many divisors, with , replacing by , and expanding &quot;ac&quot; as a sum of divisors of &quot;bc&quot;, similar to the method proposed by Hultsch and Bruins to explain some of the expansions in the Rhind papyrus.

== Modern number theory ==

Although Egyptian fractions are no longer used in most practical applications of mathematics, modern number theorists have continued to study many different problems related to them. These include problems of bounding the length or maximum denominator in Egyptian fraction representations, finding expansions of certain special forms or in which the denominators are all of some special type, the termination of various methods for Egyptian fraction expansion, and showing that expansions exist for any sufficiently dense set of sufficiently smooth numbers.

*One of the earliest publications of Paul Erdős proved that it is not possible for a harmonic progression to form an Egyptian fraction representation of an integer. The reason is that, necessarily, at least one denominator of the progression will be divisible by a prime number that does not divide any other denominator. The latest publication of Erdős, nearly 20 years after his death, proves that every integer has a representation in which all denominators are products of three primes.
*The Erdős–Graham conjecture in combinatorial number theory states that, if the integers greater than 1 are partitioned into finitely many subsets, then one of the subsets has a finite subset of itself whose reciprocals sum to one. That is, for every , and every &quot;r&quot;-coloring of the integers greater than one, there is a finite monochromatic subset &quot;S&quot; of these integers such that formula_56 The conjecture was proven in 2003 by Ernest S. Croot III.
*Znám&#x27;s problem and primary pseudoperfect numbers are closely related to the existence of Egyptian fractions of the form formula_57 For instance, the primary pseudoperfect number 1806 is the product of the prime numbers 2, 3, 7, and 43, and gives rise to the Egyptian fraction .
*Egyptian fractions are normally defined as requiring all denominators to be distinct, but this requirement can be relaxed to allow repeated denominators. However, this relaxed form of Egyptian fractions does not allow for any number to be represented using fewer fractions, as any expansion with repeated fractions can be converted to an Egyptian fraction of equal or smaller length by repeated application of the replacement formula_58 if &quot;k&quot; is odd, or simply by replacing by if &quot;k&quot; is even. This result was first proven by .
*Graham and Jewett proved that it is similarly possible to convert expansions with repeated denominators to (longer) Egyptian fractions, via the replacement formula_59 This method can lead to long expansions with large denominators, such as formula_60 had originally used this replacement technique to show that any rational number has Egyptian fraction representations with arbitrarily large minimum denominators.
*Any fraction has an Egyptian fraction representation in which the maximum denominator is bounded by formula_61 and a representation with at most formula_62 terms. The number of terms must sometimes be at least proportional to ; for instance this is true for the fractions in the sequence , , , , , ... whose denominators form Sylvester&#x27;s sequence. It has been conjectured that terms are always enough. It is also possible to find representations in which both the maximum denominator and the number of terms are small.
* characterized the numbers that can be represented by Egyptian fractions in which all denominators are &quot;n&quot;th powers. In particular, a rational number &quot;q&quot; can be represented as an Egyptian fraction with square denominators if and only if &quot;q&quot; lies in one of the two half-open intervals formula_63
* showed that any rational number has very dense expansions, using a constant fraction of the denominators up to &quot;N&quot; for any sufficiently large &quot;N&quot;.
*Engel expansion, sometimes called an &quot;Egyptian product&quot;, is a form of Egyptian fraction expansion in which each denominator is a multiple of the previous one: formula_64 In addition, the sequence of multipliers &quot;ai&quot; is required to be nondecreasing. Every rational number has a finite Engel expansion, while irrational numbers have an infinite Engel expansion.
* study numbers that have multiple distinct Egyptian fraction representations with the same number of terms and the same product of denominators; for instance, one of the examples they supply is formula_65 Unlike the ancient Egyptians, they allow denominators to be repeated in these expansions. They apply their results for this problem to the characterization of free products of Abelian groups by a small number of numerical parameters: the rank of the commutator subgroup, the number of terms in the free product, and the product of the orders of the factors.
*The number of different &quot;n&quot;-term Egyptian fraction representations of the number one is bounded above and below by double exponential functions of &quot;n&quot;.

== Open problems ==
Some notable problems remain unsolved with regard to Egyptian fractions, despite considerable effort by mathematicians.

* The Erdős–Straus conjecture concerns the length of the shortest expansion for a fraction of the form . Does an expansion formula_66 exist for every &quot;n&quot;? It is known to be true for all , and for all but a vanishingly small fraction of possible values of &quot;n&quot;, but the general truth of the conjecture remains unknown.
* It is unknown whether an odd greedy expansion exists for every fraction with an odd denominator. If Fibonacci&#x27;s greedy method is modified so that it always chooses the smallest possible &quot;odd&quot; denominator, under what conditions does this modified algorithm produce a finite expansion? An obvious necessary condition is that the starting fraction have an odd denominator &quot;y&quot;, and it is conjectured but not known that this is also a sufficient condition. It is known that every with odd &quot;y&quot; has an expansion into distinct odd unit fractions, constructed using a different method than the greedy algorithm.
* It is possible to use brute-force search algorithms to find the Egyptian fraction representation of a given number with the fewest possible terms or minimizing the largest denominator; however, such algorithms can be quite inefficient. The existence of polynomial time algorithms for these problems, or more generally the computational complexity of such problems, remains unknown.

 describes these problems in more detail and lists numerous additional open problems.

<doc id="336351" wikidata="Q2519938" url="?curid=336351" title="Horace de Vere Cole">
<text>William Horace de Vere Cole (5 May 1881 – 25 February 1936) was an eccentric prankster born in Ballincollig, County Cork, Ireland. His most famous prank was the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; hoax where he and several others in blackface, pretending to be an Abyssinian prince and his entourage, were given a tour of the Royal Navy ship HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot;.

==Family background and early life==
Cole was the son of British Army officer William Utting Cole, a major in the 3rd Dragoon Guards who died of cholera in India when his son was a child. His mother, Mary de Vere, was a niece and heiress of politician Sir Stephen de Vere, 4th Baronet. Cole was a great-nephew of the Anglo-Irish poet Aubrey de Vere. Horace&#x27;s paternal grandfather had made his fortune dealing in quinine. His mother&#x27;s family claimed kinship with the de Vere Earls of Oxford, including 17th Earl Edward de Vere, who some believe wrote the plays and poems of William Shakespeare, and the right to the position of Lord Great Chamberlain of England. A bout of diphtheria at the age of ten seriously affected his hearing for the remainder of his life. A few years later, he was sent as a boarder to Eton College.

During the Second Boer War, Cole was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Yorkshire Hussars, in which he quickly rose to the rank of acting captain. He was wounded by a dumdum bullet on 2 July 1900 and recuperated from shrapnel wounds at the Red Cross hospital in Kroonstad until September that year. He was subsequently invalided out of the army, donating the £1,800 he received from cashing in his disability pension to the war widows and orphans fund.

On his return to England, Cole went up Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1902, although he did not complete his degree.

When his paternal grandmother, Jane, died in 1906, Cole inherited, &quot;inter alia&quot;, West Woodhay House in the parish of West Woodhay in southern Berkshire. He was unable to afford the upkeep and in 1912 sold the property to his uncle, Alfred Clayton Cole, who later became Governor of the Bank of England.

==Pranks==


As an undergraduate at Cambridge, Cole posed as the uncle of the Sultan of Zanzibar—who was visiting London at the time—to make a ceremonial visit to his own college, accompanied by his friend Adrian Stephen (the brother of Virginia Woolf).
Cole&#x27;s best-known trick was the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; hoax on 7 February 1910, when he fooled the captain of the Royal Navy warship HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; into taking him and a group of his friends in blackface, including Virginia Woolf, for an official Abyssinian delegation.
On occasion, Cole would wander the streets with a cow&#x27;s teat poking through the open fly of his trousers; once he judged he had caused optimum outrage, he would cut off the offending protrusion with a pair of scissors.
On honeymoon with his first wife in Italy, on April Fools&#x27; Day 1919 Cole dropped horse manure onto Venice&#x27;s Piazza San Marco—a city with no horses that could be reached only by boat.

Spending most of his later life in London, Cole executed a series of bold jokes and escapades aimed to deflate pompous figures of authority. His targets included members of parliament, city business owners, and naval officers. On one occasion, he directed a group of like-minded friends dressed as workmen as they dug a trench across Piccadilly. On another, he challenged an old schoolfriend from Eton, the newly elected Conservative Member of Parliament Oliver Locker-Lampson, to race him on a London street to the nearest corner, giving him a 10-yard head start. Cole had already slipped his gold watch into his friend&#x27;s pocket, and with Locker-Lampson running ahead at full speed, Cole waited till they were passing a policeman and began to yell, &quot;Stop thief!&quot; Locker-Lampson was promptly arrested and the watch was found. After savouring the moment, Cole explained that it was all a joke, and both men were told to go on their way. Unfortunately, Cole began dangerously waving his stick as though conducting an imaginary band, and both men were arrested and taken into custody. No charge was brought against Locker-Lampson, but Cole was found guilty of a breach of the peace and fined £5.

According to legend, Cole once hosted a party at which the guests discovered that they all had the word &quot;bottom&quot; in their surnames. According to another story he bought tickets for particular seats at a theatrical performance he considered pretentious and distributed them to eight bald men whose heads, painted with a single letter, spelled out the word &quot;B-O-L-L-O-C-K-S&quot; (another source claims it was four men&#x27;s heads making the word F-U-C-K), which was legible from the circle and boxes above.

With his mane of hair and bristling moustache, in the 1920s, Cole was sometimes mistaken for the Labour prime minister Ramsay MacDonald, causing dismay when Cole launched into a fierce public attack on Labour. His sister Annie married the future Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who was asked by Annie what he thought of Cole and later commented, &quot;I was obliged to say what I did think, but fortunately it appeared that was her opinion too and she was not at all inclined to be proud of her brother&#x27;s exploit... I think he must be a little mad.&quot;

Cole has also been suspected of the Piltdown Man hoax.

==Personal life==
In 1918, Cole fell in love with the eighteen-year-old Irish heiress Denise Lynch. Owing to the fortune she stood to inherit, she was a ward of the Irish Chancery and prevented from marrying until the age of 21. Lynch was eventually released from the wardship and married Cole on 30September 1918 in Dublin. She subsequently gave birth to a daughter, Valerie. The marriage ended in 1928, and he went into voluntary exile in France after losing all his money in Canadian land speculation.

In 1931, he married a former scullery maid and waitress at the Veeraswamy Indian restaurant, Mabel Winifred Mary Wright (later Mavis Wheeler, 1908–1970), who in 1935 gave birth to a son, Tristan de Vere Cole, who was the natural son of the artist Augustus John.

Cole died of a heart attack in Honfleur, France the following year and was buried at West Woodhay.

Mabel later married the archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler, who afterwards divorced her on the grounds of her adultery with Lord Vivian.

<text>Brian Julian Warry Stonehouse MBE (29 August 1918 – 2 December 1998) was an English painter and Special Operations Executive agent during World War II. He was born in Torquay, England and had a brother, Dale. When his family moved to France, he went to school in Wimereux, Pas-de-Calais. Back in Britain in 1932, he studied at the Ipswich School of Art.

==Second World War years==
Stonehouse worked as an artist but joined the Territorial Army after the outbreak of World War II. He was later conscripted into the Royal Artillery. In 1940, he worked as an interpreter for French troops in Glasgow who had been evacuated from Norway. In the autumn of 1941, he was training for a commission in the 121 Officer Cadet Unit when the Special Operations Executive contacted him. Due to his fluency in French, SOE recruited him as a wireless operator with code name of &quot;Celestin&quot;.

On 1 July 1942, Stonehouse parachuted into occupied France near the city of Tours in the Loire Valley. His radio got caught in a tree and he spent five nights in the forest before he could get it down. After finally retrieving it, the radio would not work properly and his contact told him to move to Lyon. In September, accompanied by another agent, Blanche Charlet, he went to a safe house and made contact with the other SOE agents. By August he was in regular contact with the SOE station in London. However he became careless and transmitted too much and too long. As a result, German direction-finders triangulated his position and the Milice arrested him on 24 October 1942 in near Lyon. Charlet was also captured but later managed to escape to London. After the war Stonehouse discovered that Charlet had tried to commit suicide.

In Castres prison, the Gestapo placed Stonehouse in solitary confinement while subjecting him to frequent and brutal interrogations. In December he was transferred to Fresnes prison in Paris and further interrogated. Eventually he was shipped to Germany with other SOE prisoners, including Albert Guerisse, GC, the Pat O&#x27;Leary Line organiser, and Guerisse&#x27;s Australian W/T operator, Tom Groome. In October 1943, they arrived in Saarbrücken and in November was sent to Mauthausen concentration camp. He spent a brief time in a Luftwaffe factory camp in Vienna. In mid-1944, he was transferred to the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp in Alsace with Guerisse, a.k.a. Pat O&#x27;Leary. Stonehouse saved his own life by drawing sketches for the camp commandant, guards and their families.

Throughout his time in five prisons, Stonehouse kept his personal vow of never painting or drawing an officer in uniform. At the camp he witnessed the arrival of four female SOE agents, Andrée Borrel, Vera Leigh, Diana Rowden and Sonya Olschanezky, who were all executed and disposed of in the crematorium to make them disappear without a trace, under the programme of &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; (&quot;Night and Fog&quot;). After the war, Stonehouse and Guerisse were able to testify at the Nazi war crimes trials as to the women&#x27;s fate. In 1985, Stonehouse painted a poignant watercolour of the four women from memory which now hangs in the Special Forces Club in London.

From Natzweiler-Struthof, Stonehouse was sent to the Dachau concentration camp from where he was liberated by U.S. troops on 29 April 1945. At home, he was awarded a military MBE. After the war, he remained in the military and was promoted to captain while working for the Allied Control Commission in Frankfurt, Germany where he assisted with the interrogation of Gestapo and SS members.

==Post-war==
After 1946, Stonehouse continued his career as a fashion artist in the United States, painting for magazines including &quot;Vogue&quot;, Harper&#x27;s Bazaar and Elizabeth Arden. In 1979, he returned to Britain and became a portrait painter. His clients included members of the Royal family. One of his last portraits of The Queen Mother, who sat for him many times, still hangs in the Special Forces Club in London. During his final years Stonehouse was an active Theosophist living at the London branch of the United Lodge of Theosophists.

==Brian Stonehouse&#x27;s art==
Whilst operating in France Stonehouse continued to sketch and draw people he came across. He was on several occasions told not to carry his sketch books with him whilst &#x27;on duty&#x27; (Interview with his surviving brother, May 2007). Throughout his times in various prisons he continued to draw, at first secretly, but after discovery more openly. His collections of drawings of fellow SOE prisoners, life in prison and prison guards along with other personal artefacts was handed over by the Stonehouse Family to the Imperial War Museum London in May 2007. These included, as well as the War Art, for example, postwar letters from surviving SOE operatives and letters and photographs from US President Dwight D. Eisenhower. This last collection included a signed photograph and note from Eisenhower upon meeting Stonehouse again shortly after the war ended. This stated that upon meeting each other again, Stonehouse asked Eisenhower if he knew why he had survived the war. The response from Eisenhower was, &quot;I was going to ask you that&quot;.
Moyse&#x27;s Hall Museum Bury St Edmunds discovered and facilitated the handing over of the collections following a VE Day (Victory in Europe Day)/VJ day (Victory over Japan Day) exhibition, to which the family had bought Brian&#x27;s art and other personal artefacts. A series of exhibitions of Stonehouse&#x27;s fashion work was held at the Abbott and Holder gallery in London in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.

<text>Ruby Macie Muhammad (née Grier) ( – died March 2, 2011) was an African American religious figure and centenarian known as the &quot;Mother of the Nation of Islam.&quot; She was born on a farm in Sandersville, Georgia and grew up in Americus. No birth certificate exists to confirm her age, and it has been reported with significant disparity, although she claimed in newspaper interviews that she was born Ruby Macie Grayer on March 20, 1897. Later research, however, suggests she was born in 1907, a decade later, based on the listing of Ruby Macie Grier, recorded as aged 3, in the 1910 census.

Her mother, died when she was very young, and she was raised by a woman she called her aunt, although she would later say that this woman was probably not her biological aunt. She did not know her father until she was a teenager. Community records in Sandersville, where she was born, indicate her father died at age 107 and her great-grandfather died at age 110.

==Mother of Islam ==
Muhammad spent her early years working in the fields and joined the Nation of Islam in 1946 and was named &quot;Mother of the Nation of Islam&quot; in 1986 by Minister Louis Farrakhan. This is an honorary title; Muhammad, who was married twice, was not the widow of Elijah Muhammad, who founded the Nation of Islam.

In 2006, Muhammad moved into a senior center in Rancho Cordova, Sacramento, California. In 2008, Muhammad, then known as Ruby Pittman (the name of her first husband), received a motorized wheelchair as a donation from a scooter store.

==Personal life==
Ruby Muhammad was married to John Pittman and had four children. After her first husband died she married James Hyder in 1967.

<doc id="336356" wikidata="Q3298950" url="?curid=336356" title="Mathilde Carré">
<text>Mathilde Carré (30 June 1908 in Le Creusot, France – 30 May 2007), née Mathilde Lucie Bélard and known as &quot;La Chatte&quot; (&quot;The Cat&quot;), was a French Resistance agent during World War II who betrayed the Franco-Polish resistance organization, Interallie, and, as a double agent, was responsible for the arrest of dozens of Interallié operatives by the German occupiers of France. French Resistance leader Pierre de Vomécourt persuaded her to leave France with him and become an agent for the British. Upon arrival in Britain she was interrogated and imprisoned for the remainder of the war. After the war she was deported to France and convicted of treason and sentenced to death. The sentence was later reduced and she was released from prison in 1954. 

==Early life==
Carré was born in Le Creusot, Saône-et-Loire. In the 1930s she attended Sorbonne University and became a teacher. After her marriage, she moved to Algeria with her husband, Maurice Carré, who was later killed in World War II, during the Italian campaign.

==World War II==
Carré returned to France, worked as a nurse and witnessed her country fall to the Germans. In 1940, she met Polish Air Force Captain Roman Czerniawski, whose cryptonym was &quot;Walenty&quot; to the Poles and &quot;Armand&quot; or &quot;Victor&quot; to the French. Carré, who had contacts with the Vichy Second Bureau, joined the headquarters section of his Franco-Polish &quot;Interallié&quot; network, a Franco/Polish espionage network based in Paris under the cryptonym &quot;Victoire&quot; (as all of the headquarters section staff had &quot;V&quot; initial names in a network that named its agents and their sectors or areas of coverage for given names grouped by the letters of the alphabet), but she was nicknamed &quot;La Chatte&quot;, (&quot;The She-cat&quot;) for her feline predatory and stealthy propensities.

In October 1941, the Interallié had come to the attention of the Germans and Abwehr&#x27;s Sergeant Hugo Bleicher was tasked with infiltrating the network. A captured agent gave Bleicher, names and addresses of Interallié members. In November, twenty-one members of Interallié were arrested by the Abwehr in Cherbourg and on 17 November the leaders, including Czerniawski and Carré, were arrested in Paris. After her arrest, according to Bleicher, Carré immediately gave him the names of everyone in Interallié. The information she provided enabled the Germans to destroy Interallié. She was released a day later and subsequently lived with Bleicher. She accompanied the Germans on raids to arrest Interallié agents. As a German double agent she continued to use the codename &quot;Victoire.&quot; The Germans also captured four radio transmitters which would be used to send false messages to SOE in London. Interallié was destroyed. 

Pierre de Vomécourt, an agent in France of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) of Great Britain, had no wireless operator, and no means of communicating with SOE headquarters in London. He needed money as he had financed nearly all the expenses of his activities from his own pocket. Through an attorney in Paris, he was introduced on 26 December 1942 to Carré. Carré introduced Bleicher to Vomécourt as &quot;Jean Castell,&quot; a Belgian resistance leader. What neither SOE headquarters nor Vomécourt knew was that Interallié was &quot;burned&quot; and that Carré was working for the German intelligence agency, the Abwehr. She said she had access to a wireless (one of those captured by the Germans) and could arrange for the transmittal of messages from Vomécourt to London. He was initially suspicious and tested her by having her send a message to London asking SOE for money. Two days later SOE responded and Carré told him a British agent would give him the money in Vichy. Vomécourt went to Vichy and received the money. SOE headquarters had been working with Interallié so it accepted the German&#x27;s message to them as genuine.

Despite SOE&#x27;s confidence in Interallié, Vomécourt was still suspicious of Carré and in January 1942, his suspicions were heightened. He asked her to procure forged identity cards and she complied quickly, too quickly in his opinion and the cards were too good. Challenged, she admitted she was working for the Germans. Vomécourt then hatched a plan for Carré to persuade the Germans that she should go to SOE headquarters in London with him. Carré said she persuaded Bleicher and the Germans that she could return to France with valuable information about SOE. The Abwehr accepted her story and in early February, sent a message to London, supposedly from Vomécourt, requesting immediate evacuation from France of Vomécourt and Carré, saying their lives were in danger. After many misadventures, the two reached England via a British naval vessel on 27 February. This was the end of Carré&#x27;s career as a double and triple agent. She was interrogated and imprisoned for the remainder of the war.

==Postwar==
After the war, Carré was deported to France where she faced charges for treason. At the trial, which started on 3 January 1949, the prosecution read from her diary: &quot;What I wanted most was a good meal, a man, and, once more, Mozart&#x27;s Requiem.&quot; She was sentenced to death on 7 January 1949. Three months later, the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and later further reduced. Carré was released in September 1954. She published an account of her life in &quot;J&#x27;ai été &quot;La Chatte&quot;&quot; (1959; revised in 1975 as &quot;On m&#x27;appelait la Chatte&quot; (&quot;I Was Called the Cat&quot;)). She died in Paris at the age of 98.

<doc id="336357" wikidata="Q3142362" url="?curid=336357" title="Hugo Bleicher">
<text>Hugo Bleicher (August 9, 1899 – August, 1982) was a sergeant in Nazi Germany&#x27;s Abwehr (military intelligence agency) assigned to the Geheime Feldpolizei (secret field police) in German-occupied France during World War II. Described as a &quot;super spy-catcher,&quot; Bleicher infiltrated resistance networks in France and was responsible for the arrest of more than one hundred French resistors and British Special Operations Executive (SOE) agents. Most of the SOE agents he captured were later executed.

==Early life==
Hugo Ernst Bleicher was born in Tettnang, Germany on 9 August 1899. He was the son of a businessman. In World War I, he was drafted into the German army. He was captured by the British near the Somme River and interned as a prisoner of war. He escaped four times, but was recaptured each time. After the war he worked for a export company in Hamburg and from 1925 to 1928 in Morocco. On return to Hamburg, he lived the normal life of a businessman, marrying in 1929. The couple had a child in 1939. He was not involved in politics, but interested in languages.

== World War II ==
In August 1939, Bleicher responded to a newspaper advertisement asking for volunteers with language skills. Bleicher spoke fluent French and passable Spanish and English. He volunteered for what he thought was a civilian job, but in November 1939 he was called up to serve in the German military and sent for training as an undercover policeman. After the German conquest of France he was assigned by the Abwehr to Caen and later to Cherbourg.

===&quot;Interallié&quot;===
The resistance organization &quot;Interallié&quot; was founded by Polish soldiers stranded in France after its defeat and occupation by Nazi Germany in June 1940. Roman Czerniawski was the leader. A French woman, Mathilde Carré, called &quot;the Cat&quot; and &quot;Lily,&quot; became prominent in the organization as Czerniawski&#x27;s aide.

Pierre de Vomécourt was one of the earliest leaders of the French Resistance, but he lacked radio communications with the British SOE in London and needed money to continue building his resistance network. Unknown to Vomécourt and SOE, Interallié had been penetrated by Hugo Bleicher and the Abwehr. In October 1941, Bleicher had arrested an Interallié operative named Raoul Kiffer in Cherbourg. Threatened with being turned over to the Gestapo, Kiffer became an informant and the Abwehr began arresting Interallié members, including Carré who was working in Paris. Bleicher persuaded Carré to become a German agent by offering her money and luxurious accommodations. She became his mistress. In December 1941, Vomécourt contacted Interallié and Carré to use their radio link to SOE. Carré introduced Vomécourt to Bleicher who went by the alias of Jean Castell and portrayed himself as a Belgian resistance leader. Vomécourt, however, was wary and in January concluded that Carré was working for the Germans. Vomécourt confronted her and she confessed. He persuaded her to become a British agent and she persuaded Bleicher that she should accompany Vomécourt on a visit to London, the Germany theory being that she could gather information there about SOE and pass it along to the Germans after her return. However, in London Carré was interrogated and then imprisoned for the rest of the war.

Bleicher and the Abwehr had destroyed Interallié. Vomécourt returned to France on 1 April 1942. Bleicher captured one of his couriers and recognized Vomécourt&#x27;s handwriting on a report the courier carried. Knowing Vomécourt was back in France, Bleicher found and arrested him on 24 April. Bleicher interrogated Vomécourt and the two of them had an amiable chat about both being deceived by Carré. Vomécourt and several of his associates spent the rest of World War II in a German prison camp, among the few SOE agents to survive being captured by the Germans. With the arrest of Vomécourt and the destruction of his Autogiro network, SOE had few resources left in France except for Virginia Hall in Lyon.

===Carte and Spindle===
With his success in destroying Interallié, the Abwehr gave Bleicher, still only a sergeant, considerable autonomy to do his job as he saw fit and to travel throughout France to search for and arrest SOE agents and French resisters and to break up resistance networks. Bleicher used a number of aliases such as Jean Castell, Monsieur Jean, and Colonel Henri. Bleicher did not rush into making arrests. He preferred to gather information that could be used to wipe out complete networks as compared to arresting a single agent or resister. On March 21, 1943, the Abwehr told Bleicher to arrest Frenchman André Marsac and use him, if possible, to infiltrate the remnants of the Carte network, now called Spindle.

Marsac was betrayed to the Germans by his lover, Helen James, an Irish woman. In March 21, 1943, Bleicher arrested Marsac at a Paris cafe and had him incarcerated in Fresnes Prison. Over the next few days Bleicher spent hours talking to Marsac. He portrayed himself as a German colonel who was dissatisfied with the Nazis and wanted to defect to England. He needed cooperation from Marsac or he would be forced to turn him over to the Gestapo. Marsac pledged his cooperation provided that Bleicher would help him escape. Together they hatched a plan to flee to England. Bleicher persuaded Marsac to write a letter to his second-in-command, Roger Bardet, introducing him as a potential defector who needed transportation to England.

Armed with a letter of introduction from Marsac and the blessing of Bardet, Bleicher traveled to the village of Saint-Jorioz. He met with SOE agent Odette Sansom. He asked her to arrange an evacuation flight for him and Marsac and said they would return on April 18 to depart France on the airplane. She wired SOE in London seeking advice and was told to break off all contact with &quot;Colonel Henri&quot; and go into hiding immediately. However, she and her organiser (leader) Peter Churchill did not move quickly enough. Not expecting Colonel Henri until April 18, they stayed in Saint-Jorioz and were arrested by Bleicher on April 16. Bardet, compromised by Bleicher, became a German agent and helped Bleicher destroy other SOE networks. Marsac and Bardet survived the war as did Sansom and Churchill.
Bardet helped Bleicher destroy the Inventor network, leading to the arrests in October/November 1943 of its organiser Sidney Jones, wireless operator Marcel Clech, and courier Vera Leigh, all of whom were executed, and resulting in the collapse of the network. Bardet also helped arrest Henri Frager, another former Carte member who had been commissioned by the SOE as leader of its Donkeyman circuit, whom Bleicher arrested in July 1944. Frager was subsequently executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grehan/Mace&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postwar ==
In summer 1944, as the allied armies approached Paris, Bleicher requested that he and 10 agents be reassigned to Auxerre, which was further from the allied armies. His mistress, Suzanne Laurent, accompanied him to Auxerre. He was safe there for only a short time, fleeing with Laurent to Utrecht in the Netherlands. He refused to surrender when the Canadian army captured Utrecht and fled again to Amsterdam. 

Hugo Bleicher, together with two of his French Abwehr agents Jean Rocquefort and Francois Barbier, was arrested in Amsterdam on 15 May 1945 by the Dutch NBS, who interrogated him for two weeks on his activities in the Netherlands before handing him over to the First Canadian Army, who interrogated him for a further period, also on his operations in the Netherlands, before handing him over to the British authorities, who transferred him on 16 June 1945 to the UK for longer term interrogation at Camp 020. He was handed over to the French government on 12 October 1945, and they also interrogated him.
While imprisoned in Paris he met Bardet and told him he had planned to assassinate him on one occasion as Bardet knew too much against him.
He visited the UK after the war, to testify against Abwehr colleague Robert Alesch during his trial in May 1948 as a double agent. He also visited Peter Churchill in France.

Bleicher&#x27;s persuasiveness influenced even those who prosecuted him. He maintained that his job was to &quot;arrest spies, imprison them, and then entertain them with Viennese waltzes.&quot; He denied mistreating prisoners. SOE agents captured by him said he was &quot;extremely nice and polite&quot; and his British and French counterparts respected him for his expertise. &quot;At the end of the espionage intrigue,&quot; said author Larry Loftis, &quot;the deft spy-catcher had once again proven his mastery of the game.&quot; According to author Sarah Helm, Bleicher was never charged with a crime. His imprisonment was for interrogation.

After being released from prison, Bleicher ran a tobacco shop in Tettnang. In 1954, he published his memoirs, &quot;Colonel Henri&#x27;s story&quot;. He was decorated by the Abwehr with the War Merit Cross 1st Class for his services.

The character of Sergeant Gratz in the 1970 LWT television series &quot;Manhunt&quot; suggests that he is partly inspired by Bleicher.

<text>De Luxe Records (later DeLuxe Records) was a record company and label formed in 1944 by brothers David Braun (1908–1985) and Julius &quot;Jules&quot; Braun (1911–2002), the sons of Hungarian Jewish immigrants, in Linden, New Jersey. The label flourished in the 1940s and 1950s, notably for its rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) and early rock and roll recordings.

Early recordings on the label covered a range of styles including R&amp;B, gospel, jazz, and polka. The first singles on the label included some by the vocal group the Four Blues (who also recorded gospel as the Golden Echo Quartet), Billy Eckstine, and Benny Carter.

In 1947, the Braun brothers went to New Orleans seeking new talent, and discovered and signed bandleaders Paul Gayten and Dave Bartholomew, and singers Roy Brown and Annie Laurie. Brown had a national R&amp;B hit the following year with &quot;Good Rocking Tonight&quot;, a notable precursor of rock and roll. Several of the label&#x27;s other New Orleans–based musicians also achieved success. Recording studio owner Cosimo Matassa said that the Braun brothers were the first talent scouts to go to New Orleans to record local musicians commercially.

In 1947, Syd Nathan, the founder and owner of King Records, purchased a majority interest in DeLuxe. The Braun brothers then set up another label, Regal Records. In 1949, Nathan moved the DeLuxe label to Cincinnati, Ohio and in 1951, after a bitter legal battle, he bought out the Braun brothers. Otis Williams and the Charms, The Manhattans and Donnie Elbert were among artists who recorded R&amp;B hits for DeLuxe from the mid-1950s to the early 1970s.

<doc id="336361" wikidata="Q468832" url="?curid=336361" title="Claude Duval">
<text>Claude Du Vall (or Duval) (c. 164321 January 1670) was a French highwayman in Restoration England. He worked in the service of exiled royalists who returned to England under King Charles II. Little else is known of his history. According to popular legend, he abhorred violence, showing courtesy to his victims and chivalry to their womenfolk, thus spawning the myth of the romantic highwayman, as taken up by many novelists and playwrights.

==Early life==

Per one account, Claude Duval was born in Domfront, Orne, Normandy in about 1643 to Pierre Duval, a miller, and Marguerite, daughter of a tailor. A &#x27;family fable suggested&#x27; they were once &#x27;landed lords, but there was little evidence left to show for it&#x27;. His origin and parentage are in dispute. He did, however, have a brother, Daniel Duval. At the age of 14 he was sent to Paris where he worked as a domestic servant. He later became a stable boy for a group of English royalists and moved to England in the time of the English Restoration as a footman of the Duke of Richmond (possibly a relation) and rented a house in Wokingham.

==Highwayman==
The legend goes that before long, Duval became a successful highwayman who robbed the passing stagecoaches on the roads to London, especially Holloway between Highgate and Islington and, that unlike most other highwaymen, he distinguished himself with rather gentlemanly behaviour and fashionable clothes.

He reputedly never used violence. One of his victims was Squire Roper, Master of the Royal Buckhounds, whom he relieved of 50 guineas and tied to a tree.

There are many tales about Duval. A particularly famous one – placed in more than one location and later published by William Pope – claims that he took only a part of his potential loot from a gentleman, when the man&#x27;s wife agreed to dance the &quot;courante&quot; with him in the wayside, a scene immortalised by William Powell Frith in his 1860 painting &quot;Claude Duval&quot;.

If his intention was to deter pursuit by his non-threatening behaviour, he did not totally succeed. After the authorities promised a large reward, he fled to France for some time but returned a few months later. Shortly afterwards, he is said to have been arrested in the Hole-in-the-Wall tavern in London&#x27;s Chandos Street, Covent Garden.

==Execution==
On 17 January 1670, judge Sir William Morton found him guilty of six robberies (others remained unproven) and sentenced him to death. Despite many attempts to intercede, the King did not pardon him and he was executed on 21 January at Tyburn. When his body was cut down and exhibited in Tangier Tavern, it drew a large crowd. It is traditionally thought Duval was buried under the centre aisle of the church of St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden; the parish register notes the burial of a &quot;Peter Duval&quot; in January 1670.

A memorial at the church reads:

:Here lies DuVall: Reder, if male thou art,
:Look to thy purse; if female, to thy heart.
:Much havoc has he made of both; for all
:Men he made to stand, and women he made to fall
:The second Conqueror of the Norman race,
:Knights to his arm did yield, and ladies to his face.
:Old Tyburn’s glory; England’s illustrious Thief,
:Du Vall, the ladies&#x27; joy; Du Vall, the ladies&#x27; grief.

The apparently gallant highwayman inspired a number of biographers and playwrights to add to his legend, including claims of alchemy, gambling, and much womanising.

He is reported to haunt the Holt Hotel along the A4260 (Oxford Road) in Oxfordshire, a hotel where he spent many nights when it was a small coaching inn.

==Popular culture==

Recent historians have reappraised the legacy of Duval. James Sharpe in &quot;Dick Turpin&quot; regarded Duval as the most significant figure in the shaping of the highwayman myth. John and Philip Sugden&#x27;s &quot;The Thief of Hearts&quot; reconstructs what is known of the historical Duval, using much fresh evidence, and shows that the traditions about the Frenchman were used by such literary luminaries as Samuel Butler (&quot;A Pindarick Ode&quot;), John Gay (&quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;) and William Harrison Ainsworth (&quot;Rookwood&quot; and &quot;Talbot Harland&quot;) to create the iconic image of the gentleman highwayman still beloved today.

* &quot;As he reached this spot, a man started from the obscurity, and requested with the politeness of a Claude Duval to know the time.&quot; From &quot;Mountains and Molehills; or, Recollections of a Burnt Journal&quot;, 1855, by Francis Samuel Marryat, (1826–1855).
* A comic opera called &quot;Claude Duval&quot; was written in 1881 by Edward Solomon and Henry Pottinger Stephens and enjoyed success both in Britain and in America.
* In Mary Hooper&#x27;s book &quot;The Remarkable Life and Times of Eliza Rose&quot;, Duval is said to be a friend of Nell Gwyn and is credited with saving King Charles II of England&#x27;s life.
* A public house in the town of Camberley in Surrey is named in his honour.
* From 1953 to 1959 the British comic &quot;The Comet&quot; ran a popular strip about Duval, making him older than in reality so that he could be a Royalist officer during the Civil War and a Royalist agent during the Commonwealth and Protectorate. &quot;Comet&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Claude Duval The Laughing Cavalier&quot; was also published as a stand-alone Thriller Comics Library comic book in 1955.
* The &quot;Comet&quot; comic strip was sufficiently successful that in 1956 film director-producer George King devised a television series called &quot;The Gay Cavalier&quot; featuring Duval (played by French actor Christian Marquand) and another character from the comic, the Cromwellian intelligence officer Major Midas Mould (played by Ivan Craig). The series was made by Associated-Rediffusion and broadcast from May to August 1957. Despite having starred such actors as Christopher Lee and Nigel Stock, none of the 13 episodes appears to have survived.
* A 2005 Travel Channel &quot;Haunted Hotels&quot; documentary on hauntings claims that Claude Duval&#x27;s ghost presently haunts the Holt Hotel, the tavern wherein he was arrested before being condemned to death. This same documentary also claims several people were murdered by Duval, despite scant evidence.
* Michelle Lowe&#x27;s novel, Cherished Thief, published in 2012, depicts Claude DuVal&#x27;s entire life story.
* In Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s short story &quot;One Crowded Hour&quot;, a victim of a chivalrous highway robber rebukes the robber, saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t come the Claude Duval over us.&quot;
* He was the subject of London Dungeon exhibition in May 2015.
* Is a subject in the podcast radio-play Adventures of Sage &amp; Savant Episode 206

<doc id="336362" wikidata="Q458327" url="?curid=336362" title="Honoré Théodore Maxime Gazan de la Peyrière">
<text>Honoré Théodore Maxime Gazan de la Peyrière (; 29 October 1765 – 9 April 1845) was a French general who fought in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.

Gazan started his military career as a cannonier in the French Coast Guard. He was later appointed to the Royal Life Guards and, upon the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789, he joined the French National Guard. After service in the Upper Rhine valley and the Netherlands, he joined André Masséna in Switzerland in 1799, and fought at the battles of Winterthur and First Zurich, and Näfels. In August 1805, Gazan commanded of a division of the Army that encircled the Austrians in Ulm. On 11 November, under Joseph Mortier, his division provided the advance guard in the advance on Vienna. Mortier over-extended his line of march and Gazan&#x27;s division was surrounded by Kutuzov&#x27;s Coalition army; Gazan lost 40 percent of his force in the Battle of Dürenstein. Following the Prussian defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt, he transferred with Jean Lannes to the Iberian Peninsula. There he participated in the French capture of Zaragoza and in several important actions of the long Peninsular War, including the Battle of Albuera and the Battle of Vitoria.

During the Hundred Days, Gazan eventually joined Napoleon&#x27;s cause, although he did not have a field command. In 1815, he judged Michel Ney&#x27;s trial for treason but refused to reach a verdict. He dabbled briefly, and unsuccessfully, in politics in the 1820s. In 1830, he was raised to the French peerage and held a divisional command in Marseilles, but by then was an old man, and he retired in 1832. He died in 1845.

==Family and early military career==
Gazan was born in the small town of Grasse, in the Alpes-Maritimes. His father, a lawyer, sent him to the college of Sorèze, where he received military training. Gazan became a second lieutenant in the Coast Guard cannoniers of Antibes at the age of fifteen. In 1786, he was appointed to the Royal Life Guards, Company &quot;Écossaise&quot;. Later, he also joined the Freemasons.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
At the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, Gazan returned to Grasse and joined the National Guard. In 1790, he became a captain and, in 1791, a lieutenant colonel of the local volunteer battalion of the Var. In 1792, with the declaration of war with Austria, he was sent to the 27th Regiment. His regiment first served garrison duty in Strasbourg, but in December 1793, participated in the Battle of Wissembourg. In May 1794, Gazan became a battalion commander of the new 54th Demi-Brigade. On 4 July, he routed the Prussians in Kuppenheim by ordering his drummers to beat a charge, convincing the Prussians that they were outnumbered. He was promoted to brigade colonel on 11 July and led his troops to victory against the Prussians at Trippstadt.

In 1796, he joined the Army of the Rhine, under the command of Jean Victor Moreau. This was his first campaign and he was promoted to brigadier general in recognition of his outstanding achievements at the Battle of Ettlingen. Gazan was wounded on 22 November 1796 and taken to hospital in Strasbourg for his recovery, where he met Marie Madeleine Reiss; after their marriage, she frequently accompanied him on his campaigns and they had several children.

===Swiss campaign===

On 4 April 1799, his superior and friend André Masséna transferred him to the Army of the Danube, at that time located in the northeastern Swiss plateau. There, he took command of a weak (under-manned) brigade at the small town of Winterthur, in northern Switzerland. On 26 May, Michel Ney, the newly appointed general of division, took command of the forward line protecting the main French force at Zürich. The following day, Friedrich, Baron von Hotze, arrived with close to 8,000 battle-hardened and experienced Austrian border troops, including the 12th Infantry &quot;Manfredini&quot;, a battalion of Hungarian grenadiers, and six squadrons of the &quot;Waldeck&quot; Dragoons. In the ensuing clash, Ney ordered Gazan&#x27;s under-manned brigade to the center, where it was soon overwhelmed. In retreat, they safely crossed a bridge spanning a small river, the Töss, but the cavalry guarding the bridge was itself forced back. After stationing his batteries on a slight incline, to protect the retreat from the Austrians, the injured Ney handed command to Gazan, who organized and conducted the successful retreat.

A few days later, at the First Battle of Zürich (4 June 1799), the Austrian force overpowered the French lines. As part of the V. Division of the Army of the Danube, Gazan again commanded the rear guard after Massena&#x27;s force disengaged from Archduke Charles&#x27; army and withdrew across the Limmat river. Later that year, he faced a combined Austrian and Russian force at the Second Battle of Zürich (27 September). His division repulsed Russian outposts at the Limmat river. He subsequently participated in the wild pursuit of the Austrians, resulting in a decisive French victory. He was promoted to division commander and continued in the campaign against Coalition troops in Switzerland.

In 1800, Gazan accompanied the Masséna&#x27;s Army of Italy, as a general of division in the Corps of Jean-de-Dieu Soult. The 1st Division included the Grenadiers &quot;Piedmontais&quot;, the 30th &quot;Legne&quot; (light infantry), and portions of the 2nd, 3rd, and 78th &quot;Regiments Ligne&quot; (line infantry), totaling approximately 4,500 men. While Soult&#x27;s Corps campaigned in central northern Italy, Masséna was besieged in Genoa by an Austrian army of 24,000 and a British naval squadron. Soult moved his Corps to the east to relieve Genoa. As part of Soult&#x27;s Corps, Gazan participated in the battle at Bocchetta Pass (9 April), where he commanded the right wing, and again at the battle of Sassello (10 April). In both clashes, his division was outnumbered nearly three to one took heavy casualties French had heavy casualties. Later in the month, he participated in the clash at Voltri (18 April 1800). To relieve Masséna at Genoa, Soult organized several assaults on strong Austrian positions around the city. At Montecreto (13 May 1800), Gazan&#x27;s division and the first column of Soult&#x27;s main force (approximately 5,000 men), attacked a stronger Austrian position of 7,000, under command of Prince Hohenzollern. Soult was taken prisoner, General of Brigade Joseph Perrin was killed, and the cavalry commander, Jean-Joseph Gauthier, was badly wounded. The defeat could be seen from the ramparts at Genoa and caused the French garrison&#x27;s morale to plummet; many units were already near mutiny and food was scarce. Gazan, who had been wounded, took his troops to Lozano and joined Louis Gabriel Suchet. There he commanded a division of the Army of Italy and fought in a French victory at the battle in Pozzolo (25 December) against the Austrians. He was appointed commander of the First Subdivision of the 27th Military Division in Piedmont. After the peace in 1801, Gazan returned home, but shortly after his return, received a new assignment as commander of a brigade in northern Italy, where he stayed until the declaration of the First French Empire in 1804.

==Service during the Napoleonic Wars==

===Dürrenstein and Jena===

In the War of the Third Coalition, Gazan initially was assigned as a division commander of Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée in Lille, in preparation for the planned invasion of England; he remained there until the idea was abandoned. In August 1805, Gazan commanded of a division of the army that encircled Austrians in Ulm. On 11 November, under Marshal Mortier, his division provided the advance guard in the march against Kutuzov&#x27;s army. As they advanced through a narrow Danube canyon, the division was isolated from the main force, near Dürenstein. By the small village on the Danube, famous as the prison of Richard the Lionhearted at the end of the twelfth century, he and his division were trapped in a narrow canyon, attacked by a Russian force at his rear and more Russians at his front. Gazan&#x27;s division fought desperately for a harrowing day and suffered 40 percent casualties. He and Mortier were finally rescued by the arrival of the VIII. Corps&#x27; 1st Division, commanded by Pierre Dupont de l&#x27;Étang, but only after the loss of nearly 4,000 men. In addition, 47 officers and 895 men were captured, and he lost five guns, as well as the eagles of the 4th Infantry Regiment, and the eagle and guidon of the 4th Dragoons. As recognition of his conduct in &quot;the immortal Battle of Dürenstein&quot;, he received the Officers Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor and the survivors of his division was sent to Vienna to recuperate. When Austria sued for peace, Gazan&#x27;s division was sent to Würzburg in Bavaria, where it remained until Prussia declared war in October 1806.

Gazan&#x27;s division fought in the French victory over Prussia at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt (14 October 1806). At Ostrolenka (16 February 1807), Gazan&#x27;s troops took three guns and two Russian colors. Otherwise, his troops stayed in their winter quarters. After the new peace treaty, Gazan&#x27;s troops were sent to Silesia to restore order. In 1808, he was named &quot;Comte de la Peyriére&quot;.

===Early Peninsular War===

In October 1808, now attached to the VI. Corps, Gazan went to Spain with Jean Lannes and arrived at Zaragoza in December. The city was under siege and defended by Spanish under José de Palafox. Lannes ordered an attack on 22 January 1809 to capture the city in street by street fighting; when the French took a block, sappers tunneled under the houses and blew them up, which prevented Spanish street fighters from slipping into houses behind them. The method was effective but painstaking. Gazan&#x27;s assignment, to take the well-fortified Jesus Convent. Palafox surrendered on 20 February. The VI. Corps occupied northern Aragon afterward.

In July 1810, Gazan&#x27;s force guarded the valleys of Extremadura, near Alcantara. In September he fought against Spanish general La Romana. In Fary 1811 he crossed the Sierra Morena to guard the supply On 15–21 March, his 2nd Division of the V. Corps besieged and captured the small fortified town of Campo Maior, in eastern Portugal. There they captured 50 guns and the 100-man Portuguese garrison. As General Latour-Maubourg, four squadrons of dragoons and hussars and three battalions of the 100th Light Infantry moved the cannons to Badajoz the following week, a combined force of the 1st and 7th Portuguese Cavalry and the British 13th Light Dragoons, commanded by Brigadier General Robert Ballard Long, charged and scattered the French 26th Dragoons. In the melee, the drivers of the convoy were cut down, but instead of securing the convoy of guns, the British and Portuguese enthusiastically pursued the fleeing infantry for more than ; meanwhile, the French sallied out of Badajoz, carefully avoiding the fleeing infantry and its pursuers, and recovered all but one of the guns.

At the Battle of Albuera (16 May 1811), the &quot;bloodiest battle of the Peninsular Campaign,&quot; Gazan&#x27;s division was hammered by the British. The force, composed of two brigades of infantry, one of cavalry and 40 guns, were enveloped by the British on three sides. General of Division Girard&#x27;s 1st Division was also trapped. The fire-fight wrought massive casualties, and the bodies were reportedly stacked three and four men high; the distinction was in 360 French muskets in deep and narrow columns versus 2000 British flintlocks in a double line of infantry. Only a costly mistake by the British commander, Major General Colborne, prevented a worse disaster for the French. Colborne had deployed his infantry in the standard line, two men deep, and had prepared to fire close range volleys into the French flank. Recognizing the opportunity, Latour-Marbourg&#x27;s 2nd Hussars and First Vistula Lancers (a Polish unit) to attack the British line before the infantry could form its defensive squares. The French cavalry wrought massive casualties on Colborne&#x27;s brigade. The 3rd (East Kent) Regiment of Foot (&quot;The Buffs&quot;) lost 643 of its 754 men at Albuera, most of them in the initial onslaught of French cavalry. The next two regiments in line lost over 500 men combined and Colborne&#x27;s brigade lost 1,413 out of its 2,166 men. Despite the mounted assault, however, the French 2nd Division suffered high casualties and lost five colors, a significant blow to its morale and pride.) Gazan was wounded in the battle, and returned to Seville, where he was assigned to a staff position during his recovery.

===Gazan and the 1813 Peninsular War===

In June 1813, Gazan was appointed commander of the Joseph Bonaparte&#x27;s Army of the South. Joseph had established a long defensive line on the heights of Puebla, with the Army of Portugal at the left flank, the Army of the center, commanded by Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d&#x27;Erlon and the Army of the South, at the southern flank. On 21 June, Generals Rowland Hill and Pablo Morillo moved toward the south end of the valley; Gazan and d&#x27;Erlon asked Jean-Baptiste Jourdan for reinforcements, but the Corps&#x27; commander was preoccupied with the possibility of an attack at the opposite flank, and sent none. In their own turn, D&#x27;Erlon and Gazan could not agree on how to deal with the approaching threat. In the initial stages of battle, the Army of Portugal started to pull back. Realizing that his southern flank would not hold up in the face of Hill and Morillo, Joseph ordered Gazan to withdraw in ordered masses. Hill and Morillo attacked Gazan&#x27;s forces with such force that Gazan withdrew.

This was Gazan&#x27;s last field command. Gazan&#x27;s pre-emptive withdrawal created a gap in French line, exposing D&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s army in the center. D&#x27;Erlon held his position as long as he could, but the line collapsed around him. Joseph&#x27;s planned orderly withdrawal turned into a rout. Gazan abandoned all his artillery. The Allies captured the entire supply convoy, all the baggage and took many prisoners, including Gazan&#x27;s wife and children, although they later managed to rejoin him. After losing their supply train, the plight of the French army was terrible. Gazan mentioned that general officers and subordinates alike &quot;were reduced to the clothes on their backs and most of them were barefoot,&quot; but the rank and file of the army also suffered enormously from hunger, exposure, and disease. When Soult took command of the new Army of the Pyrenees, Gazan became his chief of staff until Napoleon&#x27;s abdication.

==Napoleon&#x27;s return and later life==
During the Hundred Days, Gazan hesitated but eventually joined Napoleon, with little enthusiasm and he did not receive a field command. After the war, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan persuaded Gazan to be part of the &quot;Conseil&quot; convened on 9 November 1815 to try Michel Ney for treason. Despite his oath of allegiance to the restored monarchy, the loyal Ney had rallied to Napoleon&#x27;s banner immediately upon his landing in southern France and had led a corps into battle at Waterloo. The King wished to make a point to Napoleon&#x27;s former marshals and Ney became the focus of his wrath. Gazan&#x27;s relationship with Ney had begun in the French Revolutionary Wars shortly after Ney&#x27;s promotion to general of division. At the Battle of Winterthur (1799), he had been one of Ney&#x27;s first brigade commanders. Although the King&#x27;s government may have expected the &quot;Conseil&quot; to find Ney guilty, the members voted 5–2 to declare themselves incapable of reaching a verdict, and deferred the case to the Chamber of Peers.

Some historians maintain that Ney&#x27;s death penalty resulted from the military court&#x27;s refusal to act in the case; only the military court could have returned a verdict of &quot;guilty under exceptional circumstances&quot;. Such a verdict would have meant Ney&#x27;s lifelong incarceration, but would not have required his execution. When the military court refused to reach a verdict, Ney&#x27;s case went to the Chamber of Peers, which was populated by a mix of old and new peers. The old peers might not have been receptive to Ney&#x27;s predicament; he had been, after all, a highly visible party to Napoleon&#x27;s success throughout Europe. If some of the new peers were sympathetic to Ney&#x27;s situation, they may also have been anxious to prove their own loyalty to the new regime. Ney&#x27;s penalty was a foregone conclusion.

Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Louis XVIII forced Gazan into retirement in Grasse, where the aging general dabbled unsuccessfully in politics. After the 1830 revolution, the new &quot;King of the French&quot; Louis Philippe made Gazan a peer of France, and he received a command of a military division in Marseille. By this time, he was an old man, and in poor health, and he retired in June 1832. Gazan de la Peyriére died in Grasse on 9 April 1845.

<text>The Venlo incident was a covert operation carried out by the German Nazi Party&#x27;s (SD) on 9 November 1939, which resulted in the capture of two British Secret Intelligence Service agents from the German border, on the outskirts of the Dutch city of Venlo.

The incident was later used by the German government to link Britain to Georg Elser&#x27;s failed assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler at the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich, on 8 November 1939, and to help justify Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Netherlands (then a neutral country) on 10 May 1940.

==Background ==

After the British declaration of war on Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was still interested in seeking a compromise peace with Germany before too much blood had been spilt. The British Government was well aware of the existence of widespread opposition among the leaders of the German Army.

During the autumn of 1939, the German opposition was extending feelers to the British government. In October, Munich lawyer Josef Müller contacted the British through the Vatican with the connivance of Colonel Hans Oster. Theodor Kordt, the younger brother of Erich, pursued similar objectives in Bern.

The Swedish industrialist Birger Dahlerus tried to establish peace through an early form of shuttle diplomacy, partly performed on Dutch soil. And in early October the Dutch ambassador in Ankara, Philips Christiaan Visser, was communicating peace proposals on the line of the Dahlerus proposals, made by Hitler&#x27;s former deputy chancellor and then ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, to the British ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen.

All diplomatic efforts to avoid a Second World War in Europe during the days preceding the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 had come to nothing. So when a German refugee named Fischer succeeded in winning the confidence of the exiled German Catholic leader, Karl Spiecker, a British intelligence informant in the Netherlands, the British SIS became interested in the information Fischer was offering.

== Covert meetings ==

In early September 1939, a meeting was arranged between Fischer and the British SIS agent Captain Sigismund Payne Best. Best was an experienced intelligence officer who worked under the cover of a businessman residing in The Hague with his Dutch wife.

Subsequent meetings included Major Richard Henry Stevens, a less-experienced intelligence operative who was working covertly for the British SIS as the passport control officer in The Hague. To assist Best and Stevens in passing through the Dutch mobilised zones near the border with Germany, a young Dutch Army officer, Lieutenant Dirk Klop, was recruited by Chief of the Dutch Military Intelligence, Major General Johan van Oorschot. Klop was permitted by Van Oorschot to sit in on covert meetings but could not take part because of his country&#x27;s neutrality.

At the early meetings Fischer brought participants who were posing as German officers who supported a plot against Hitler, and who were interested in establishing Allied peace terms if Hitler was deposed. When Fischer&#x27;s success in setting up the meetings with the British agents became known, &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Walter Schellenberg of the Foreign Intelligence section of the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; began to attend these meetings. Masquerading as a &quot;&quot;Hauptmann&quot; Schämmel&quot;, Schellenberg was at the time a trusted operative of Heinrich Himmler and was in close contact with Reinhard Heydrich during the Venlo operation.

At the last meeting between the British SIS agents and the German SD officers on 8 November, Schellenberg promised to bring a general to the meeting on the following day. Instead, the Germans brought the talks to an abrupt end with the kidnapping of Best and Stevens.

==Press reports==
The Venlo Incident was first reported in the British Press on 10 November 1939, as follows:

While the British press were unaware that two British SIS agents were involved in the border incident, Sir Alexander Cadogan, Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, was aware, as he recorded in his diary:
* &quot;November 10. Our men, who met, or were to have met, Gen[eral] yesterday, bumped off on Dutch-German frontier. Discussed matter with H. [Lord Halifax] and Menzies [Stewart Menzies]. ... Numerous reports of imminent invasion of Holland.&quot;

=== Chronology===
The covert meetings leading up to the kidnapping, as remembered by Captain S. Payne Best in his book &quot;The Venlo Incident&quot;, are summarised below.

# Best met with Fischer at an unspecified location in the Netherlands at the beginning of September 1939.
# At the second meeting, Fischer brought a Major Solms to meet Best. Best believed that Solm was a major in the Luftwaffe. They met at a small hotel in the town of Venlo. (Date unspecified)
# Best met with Fischer and Major Solms a week later. (Location and date unspecified) Solm told Best there was a conspiracy to remove Hitler from power in which some of the highest-ranking officers of the Wehrmacht were involved. Solms could give no further details as the &#x27;ringleaders&#x27; would deal directly only with Best. However, before they would meet, they required certainty that Best was a &quot;bona fide&quot; British agent and requested that he arrange for a certain paragraph to be broadcast in the German News Bulletin of the BBC. That was done twice on 11 October, about the same day that Best was informed by Major Solms he feared he was being watched by the Gestapo and needed to &#x27;lie low&#x27;. 
# On 20 October, together with Fischer, Major Stevens and Lieutenant Klop, Best met with two German officers, Captain von Seidlitz and Lieutenant Grosch, in a private house that was owned by a friend of Best in Arnhem. The meeting was interrupted by Dutch police and little progress was made. &#x27;The two Huns seemed scared out of their wits and it was very difficult to get anything out of them except that they wanted to go home&#x27;, Best recalled.
# On 30 October, Best, Major Stevens and Lieutenant Klop met with three German officers: Lieutenant Grosch, Colonel Martini and Major Schaemmel at The Hague. (Klop had collected the three Germans near Dinxperlo after they were arrested by Dutch police near the frontier.) Schaemmel, speaking for the Germans, outlined current conditions in Germany and the losses of men and material in the Polish campaign and how it was imperative the war be ended quickly. Schaemmel went on to say Hitler would not take advice from his General Staff and needed to be got rid of, but his assassination would lead to chaos. The intention was to take him prisoner and force him to give orders authorising a junta of officers to start negotiations for peace. &#x27;We are Germans and have to think of the interests of our own country first. Before we take any steps against Hitler we want to know whether England and France are ready to grant us a peace which is both just and honourable&#x27;, Best recollects Schaemmel saying at the meeting. To facilitate further dialogue, a wireless transmitting and receiving set was given to the Germans. Stevens referred Schaemmel&#x27;s question to London, and a day or two later, a noncommittal reply came back. More messages were exchanged on a daily basis by wireless before another meeting was arranged.
# On 7 November, Best, Major Stevens, Lieutenant Klop met with two German officers: Lieutenant Grosch and Major Schaemmel. Klop was instrumental in holding the meeting in the Cafe Backus, on the outskirts of Venlo, as the venue better suited the Germans, as it was close to the border crossing. Best and Stevens gave the Germans a verbal résumé of London&#x27;s answers to their questions. Though the answers appeared not to come up to their expectations, the Germans said they would pass them on to their &#x27;chief&#x27; and proposed a meeting with him the next day, as he was anxious to entrust &#x27;secret papers&#x27; to Best and Stevens for safekeeping if the plot against Hitler failed. 
# On 8 November, Best, Major Stevens and Lieutenant Klop met only with Schaemmel at the Cafe Backus. Schaemmel said the general, who was to have come, had been called by Hitler to urgent meeting in Munich to consider an appeal for peace made by the Queen of the Netherlands and the King of Belgium. Schaemmel asked Best and Stevens to meet again on the following day at the same venue to enable the general to be present, adding that as an &#x27;attempt&#x27; against Hitler was to be made on Saturday, the next day would be the last chance for a meeting.
# On 9 November, the meeting was planned for 16:00. As for the last meeting, Klop arranged for a Dutch police guard to be present at the border. Unlike previous meetings, Best and Stevens armed themselves with Browning automatics in case something went wrong.

===Aliases ===
* Fischer was known to Best as Dr Franz, a German refugee. According to Martin A. Allen, Fischer&#x27;s real name was Morz, a former follower of Otto Strasser, who was coerced by threat of death to be an agent of the SD (Agent F479).
* Major Schämmel was the alias of Walter Schellenberg, as stated above.
* Major Solms was the alias of Johannes Travaglio, a German major in Division 1 (Air Reconnaissance) of the &quot;Abwehr&quot; in Munich, the head of which was a close collaborator and friend of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris.
* Colonel Martini was the alias of Dr. Max de Crinis, an SS officer involved in the euthanasia program &quot;mercy killing&quot;, in the Central Tiergartenstraße 4, in 1939–1941.
* Captain von Seidlitz was the alias of SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; von Salish, a long-serving SD officer trusted by Walter Schellenberg
* Lieutenant Grosch was the alias of SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Christian, a long-serving SD officer trusted by Walter Schellenberg.
* Lieutenant Klop was given the name of Captain Coppens by Best and Stevens to pass him off as a British officer.

== Capture of British agents ==
Early on 9 November 1939, Schellenberg received orders from Himmler to abduct the British SIS agents, Best and Stevens. &quot;SS-Sonderkommandos&quot; under the operations command of SD man Alfred Naujocks, carried out the orders. Best drove his car into the car park at the Cafe Backus for the meeting planned for 16:00 with Schellenberg. Stevens was sitting beside him while Dirk Klop and Klop&#x27;s driver, Jan Lemmens, sat in the back seat.

Before Best had time to get out of the car, Naujock&#x27;s SD men arrived. In a brief shootout, Klop was mortally wounded. After being handcuffed and stood against a wall, Best and Stevens, together with Jan Lemmens, were bundled into the SD car. Klop was put into Best&#x27;s car and both cars were driven off over the border into Germany.
Best recalled a full body search was performed on him when they reached Düsseldorf en route to Berlin. At Düsseldorf, one of the men who had taken part in the kidnapping told Best the reason for the action was to catch some Germans plotting against the Führer, who were responsible for the attempt on his life the night earlier.
Klop was admitted to the Protestant Hospital in Düsseldorf. A doctor on duty recalled years later Klop was unconscious when he was admitted and died the same day from a gunshot wound to the head. On 29 December 1939 Klop was embalmed under the false name of Thomas Kremp, a communist; his remains were cremated and buried under a false name in the Düsseldorf cemetery in an unknown grave.

== Georg Elser connection ==
Prior to the assassination attempt at the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich on 8 November, Naujocks and his squad had been sent to Düsseldorf to support Schellenberg. Even before his private train had returned from Munich to Berlin, Hitler ordered the British SIS officers in the Netherlands be brought to Berlin for questioning. Himmler issued the order to Schellenberg early in the morning on 9 November.

Though Georg Elser, a suspect being interrogated in Munich by the Gestapo, insisted he had acted alone, Hitler recognized the propaganda value of the assassination attempt as a means to incite German public resentment against Britain. On 21 November, Hitler declared he had incontrovertible proof that the British Secret Service was behind the Munich bombing and that two British agents had been arrested near the Dutch border. The next day, German newspapers carried the story. The front page of the &quot;Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; had pictures of the conspirators named as Georg Elser, &#x27;Kaptain Stevens&#x27; and &#x27;Mr Best&#x27;.

== Aftermath ==

The Nazi press reported that the Gestapo had tricked the British Secret Service into carrying on radio contact for 21 days after Best and Stevens were abducted using the radio transmitter given to them. Himmler is accredited to quipping, &#x27;After a while it became boring to converse with such arrogant and foolish people&#x27;.

The British Foreign Office believed that Himmler was involved in the secret Anglo-German contact of autumn 1939, and that the discussions, involving prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, and the foreign secretary, Lord Halifax, were &quot;bona fide&quot; peace negotiations. Historian Callum MacDonald shared this view.

The damage inflicted on Britain&#x27;s espionage network in Europe caused the new prime minister, Winston Churchill, to start his own spy and sabotage agency, the Special Operations Executive in 1940. The incident exposed the fact that the Chamberlain government was still seeking a deal with Germany while it was exhorting the nation to a supreme war effort. That outraged Churchill to the extent that he was against providing support to German opposition to Hitler for the rest of the war.

Hitler used the incident to claim that the Netherlands had violated its own neutrality. The presence of Klop, a Dutch agent, whose signature on his personal papers was gratefully misused by the Germans, provided sufficient &quot;proof of cooperation between British and Dutch secret services, and justify an invasion of The Netherlands by Germany in May, 1940&quot;.

Naujocks was awarded the Iron Cross by Hitler the day after the kidnapping. Schellenberg gave evidence against other Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials. He died in 1952, at age 42.

== Fate of British agents ==
After interrogation at the Gestapo Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse headquarters in Berlin, Best and Stevens were sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Both were held in isolation in the T-shaped building reserved for protected prisoners of the Gestapo. While at Sachsenhausen, Best claimed he corresponded by secret letters with another protected prisoner, Georg Elser.

In January 1941, Stevens was moved from Sachsenhausen to the bunker at Dachau concentration camp, where he remained until evacuated with Best and other protected prisoners in April 1945. In February 1945, Best was transferred briefly to Buchenwald concentration camp and then to the &#x27;bunker&#x27; at Dachau concentration camp on 9 April 1945. Coincidentally, that was the same day that Elser was executed at Dachau. On 24 April 1945, Best and Stevens left Dachau with 140 other protected high-profile prisoners in a convoy bound for South Tyrol. At the lakeside Prags Wildbad Hotel, near Niederdorf, they were liberated by the advancing US Army on 4 May 1945.

<text>Deborah Sampson Gannett, also known as Deborah Samson or Deborah Sampson, (December 17, 1760 – April 29, 1827) was a Massachusetts woman who disguised herself as a man and served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Born in Plympton, Massachusetts, she served under the name Robert Shirtliff – sometimes spelled Shurtleff or Shirtleff. She was in uniform for 17 months before her sex was revealed in 1783 when she required medical treatment after contracting a fever in Philadelphia. After her real identity was made known to her commander, she was honorably discharged at West Point. After her discharge, Sampson met and married Benjamin Gannett in 1785. In 1802, she became one of the first women to go on a lecture tour to speak about her wartime experiences. She died in Sharon, Massachusetts, in 1827. She was proclaimed the Official Heroine of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on May 23, 1983, and in 1985 the United States Capitol Historical Society posthumously honored &quot;Deborah Samson&quot; with the Commemorative Medal.

==Early life==
Deborah Sampson was born on December 17, 1760, in Plympton, Massachusetts, at the ancestral home of her grandparents, a house that still stands today. Her father&#x27;s name was Jonathan Sampson (or Samson) and her mother&#x27;s name was Deborah Bradford. Her siblings were Jonathan (b. 1753), Elisha (b. 1755), Hannah (b. 1756), Ephraim (b. 1759), Nehemiah (b. 1764), and Sylvia (b. 1766). Sampson&#x27;s mother was the great-granddaughter of William Bradford, the second Governor of Plymouth Colony. Sampson&#x27;s ancestry also included &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers on both sides of her family including William Bradford (mother) and Henry Samson (father)

Sampson&#x27;s family was told that her father died in a shipwreck, but evidence indicates that he actually abandoned the family and migrated to Lincoln County, Maine. He had a common-law wife named Martha, with whom he had at least two children, and returned to Plympton in 1794 to attend to a property transaction. In 1770, a man named Jonathan Sampson was indicted for murder in Maine, but it is uncertain whether this individual was Sampson&#x27;s father because the case never went to trial, so no details about the defendant are known. Jonathan Sampson died in Maine some time after 1807.

After Sampson&#x27;s father abandoned the family her mother was unable to provide for her children, so she placed them in the households of friends and relatives, a common practice in 18th-century New England, and Sampson was placed in the home of a maternal relative. When her mother died shortly afterwards, she was sent to live with Reverend Peter Thatcher&#x27;s widow Mary Prince Thatcher (1688–1771), who was then in her eighties. Historians believe Sampson learned to read while living with Widow Thatcher, who might have wanted Sampson to read Bible verses to her.

Upon Thatcher&#x27;s death, Sampson was sent to live with the Jeremiah Thomas family in Middleborough, where she worked as an indentured servant from 1770 to 1778. Although treated well, she was not sent to school like the Thomas children because Thomas was not a believer in the education of women. Sampson was able to overcome Thomas&#x27;s opposition by learning from Thomas&#x27;s sons, who shared their school work with her. This method was apparently successful; when her time as an indentured servant was over at age 18, Sampson made a living by teaching school during the summer sessions in 1779 and 1780. She worked as a weaver in the winter; Sampson was highly skilled and worked for the Sproat Tavern as well as the Bourne, Morton, and Leonard families. During her time teaching and weaving, she boarded with the families that employed her.

Sampson was also reported to have woodworking and mechanical aptitude. Her skills included basket weaving, and light carpentry such as producing milking stools and winter sleds. She was also experienced with fashioning wooden tools and implements including weather vanes, spools for thread, and quills for weaving. She also produced pie crimpers, which she sold door to door.

==Physical description==
Sampson was approximately to tall, above average when compared to the average male of her day, who was around , and the average woman, who was about . Her biographer, Hermann Mann, who knew her personally for many years, implied that she was not thin, writing in 1797 that &quot;her waist might displease a coquette.&quot; He also reported that her breasts were very small, and that she bound them with a linen cloth to hide them during her years in uniform. Mann wrote that &quot;the features of her face are regular; but not what a physiognomist would term the most beautiful.&quot;

A neighbor who as a boy knew Sampson in her later years remarked that she was &quot;a person of plain features.&quot; A descendant named Pauline Hildreth Monk Wise (1914–1994) was believed by relatives to have strongly resembled Sampson, based on comparison of Pauline&#x27;s physical appearance to a 1797 portrait of Sampson, contemporary descriptions of Sampson&#x27;s features and height, and Pauline&#x27;s height, which at was taller than most men. Sampson&#x27;s appearance – tall, broad, strong, and not delicately feminine – contributed to her success at pretending to be a man.

==Army service==
In early 1782, Sampson wore men&#x27;s clothes and joined an Army unit in Middleborough, Massachusetts, under the name Timothy Thayer. She collected a bonus and then failed to meet up with her company as scheduled. Inquiries by the company commander revealed that Sampson had been recognized by a local resident at the time she signed her enlistment papers. Her deception uncovered, she repaid the portion of the bonus that she had not spent, but she was not subjected to further punishment by the Army. The Baptist church to which she belonged learned of her actions and withdrew its fellowship, meaning that its members refused to associate with her unless she apologized and asked forgiveness.

In May 1782, Sampson enlisted again, this time in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, under the name &quot;Robert Shirtliff&quot; (also spelled in some sources as &quot;Shirtliffe&quot; or &quot;Shurtleff&quot;). She joined the Light Infantry Company of the 4th Massachusetts Regiment, under the command of Captain George Webb. This unit, consisting of 50 to 60 men, was first quartered in Bellingham, Massachusetts, and later mustered at Worcester with the rest of the regiment commanded by Colonel William Shepard. Light Infantry Companies were elite troops, specially picked because they were taller and stronger than average. Their job was to provide rapid flank coverage for advancing regiments, as well as rearguard and forward reconnaissance duties for units on the move. Because she joined an elite unit, Sampson&#x27;s disguise was more likely to succeed, since no one was likely to look for a woman among soldiers who were specially chosen for their above average size and superior physical ability.

In June or July 1782, Sampson participated in a skirmish near Tarrytown, New York with about 30 infantrymen from her unit combating with local band of Tories. Sampson was shot in her thigh and sustained a sword cut to her forehead. She begged her fellow soldiers not to take her to a doctor out of fear her sex would be discovered, but a soldier put her on his horse and took her to a hospital. A doctor treated her head wound, but she left the hospital before he could attend to her leg. She removed the ball herself with a penknife and sewing needle, but some of the shot was too deep to reach. As described in her later applications for a pension, her leg never fully healed. On April 1, 1783, she was reassigned to new duties, and spent seven months serving as a waiter to General John Paterson.

On June 24, the President of Congress ordered George Washington to send a contingent of soldiers under Paterson to Philadelphia to help quell a rebellion of American soldiers who were protesting delays in receiving their pay and discharges. During the summer of 1783, Sampson became ill in Philadelphia and was cared for by Doctor Barnabas Binney (1751–1787). After Sampson fell unconscious due to fever, Dr. Binney removed her clothes to treat her and discovered the cloth she used to bind her breasts. Without revealing his discovery to army authorities, he took her to his house, where his wife, daughters, and a female nurse cared for her.

In September 1783, following the signing of the Treaty of Paris, November 3 was set as the date for soldiers to muster out. When Dr. Binney asked Sampson to deliver a note to General Paterson, she correctly assumed that it would reveal her sex. In other cases, women who pretended to be men to serve in the army were reprimanded, but Paterson gave her a discharge, a note with some words of advice, and enough money to travel home. She was honorably discharged at West Point, New York, by General Henry Knox on October 25, 1783, after a year and a half of service.

An official record of Deborah Sampson Gannet&#x27;s service as &quot;Robert Shirtliff&quot; from May 20, 1782, to October 25, 1783, appears in the &quot;Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors of the Revolutionary War&quot; Volume 14 p. 164.

==Marriage==
Sampson married Benjamin Gannett (1757–1837), a Sharon, Massachusetts, farmer, in Stoughton, Massachusetts, on April 7, 1785. After her discharge and marriage to Gannett, Sampson lived the first few years of her civilian life as a typical farmer’s wife. They were the parents of four children: Earl (b. 1786), Mary (b. 1788), Patience (b. 1790), and Susanna Baker Shepherd, whom they adopted after she was orphaned. They lived with Gannett&#x27;s father on the Gannett family farm, but had limited success because it was smaller than average and the land had been overworked.

==Life after the military==
In January 1792, Sampson petitioned the Massachusetts State Legislature for pay that the army had withheld because she was a woman. The legislature granted her petition and Governor John Hancock signed it. The legislature awarded her 34 pounds plus interest back to her 1783 discharge. A biography by Herman Mann was published in 1797, &quot;The Female Review: Life of Deborah Sampson, the Female Soldier in the War of Revolution&quot;.

In 1802, Sampson began giving lectures about her wartime service. After extolling the virtues of traditional gender roles for women, she left the stage, returned in her army uniform, then proceeded to perform a complicated and physically taxing military drill and ceremony routine. She performed both to earn money and to justify her enlistment, but even with these speaking engagements, her husband and she were unable to pay all the family&#x27;s expenses. She frequently had to borrow money from her family and from her friend Paul Revere. Revere also wrote letters to government officials on her behalf, requesting that she be awarded a pension for her military service and her wounds.

In 1804, Revere wrote to U.S. Representative William Eustis of Massachusetts on Sampson&#x27;s behalf. A military pension had never been requested for a woman, but Revere wrote: &quot;I have been induced to enquire her situation, and character, since she quit the male habit, and soldiers uniform; for the more decent apparel of her own gender... humanity and justice obliges me to say, that every person with whom I have conversed about her, and it is not a few, speak of her as a woman with handsome talents, good morals, a dutiful wife, and an affectionate parent.&quot; On March 11, 1805, Congress approved the request and placed Sampson on the Massachusetts Invalid Pension Roll at the rate of four dollars a month.

On February 22, 1806, Sampson wrote once more to Revere requesting a loan of ten dollars: &quot;My own indisposition and that of my sons causes me again to solicit your goodness in our favor though I, with Gratitude, confess it rouses every tender feeling and I blush at the thought of receiving ninety and nine good turns as it were – my circumstances require that I should ask the hundredth.&quot; He sent the ten dollars. In 1809, she sent another petition to Congress, asking that her pension as an invalid soldier be modified to start from her discharge in 1783. Had her petition been approved, she would have been awarded back pay of $960 ($48 a year for 20 years — approximately $13,800 in 2016). Her petition was initially denied, but when it came before Congress again in 1816 an award of $76.80 a year (about $1,100 in 2016) was approved. With this amount, she was able to repay all her loans and make improvements to the family farm.

==Death==

Sampson died of yellow fever on April 29, 1827. She was buried at Rock Ridge Cemetery in Sharon, Massachusetts.

==Spousal support==
Four years after Sampson&#x27;s death, her husband Benjamin Gannett petitioned Congress for a pension as the spouse of a veteran. In 1837, the committee overseeing his petition decreed that the history of the Revolution &quot;furnished no other example of female heroism, fidelity and courage.&quot; Gannett was awarded a pension, but died before he could receive it.

==Legacy==
===Memorials===
The town of Sharon memorializes Sampson with a statue in front of the public library, the Deborah Sampson Park, and the &quot;Deborah Sampson Gannett House&quot;, which is privately owned and not open to the public. The farmland around the home is protected to ensure no development occurs on the historic homestead.

In 1906, the town of Plympton, Massachusetts, with the Deborah Sampson Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, placed a boulder on the town green, with a bronze plaque inscribed to Sampson&#x27;s memory.

During World War II, the Liberty Ship S.S. &quot;Deborah Gannett&quot; (2620) was named in her honor. It was laid down March 10, 1944, launched April 10, 1944, and scrapped in 1962.

As of 2000, the town flag of Plympton incorporates Sampson as the Official Heroine of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

<text>Damon Records was a United States record label.

== Original ==
Victor &quot;Vic&quot; L. Damon started a recording business, Damon Transcription Laboratory in 1933 in Kansas City (Midland Building at 1221 Baltimore). He later moved the studio to 117 W. 14th Street and operated it, under the name Damon Recording Studios, until retirement in 1973. His assistant, Chuck Chapman, kept the studio running until 1975, then moved into the Cavern Sound facility in Independence, Missouri, for two more years operating as Cavern/Damon.

Damon was an in-house label of the Damon&#x27;s studio. Damon used musicians and singers who were not members of the American Federation of Musicians labor union to make recordings during the ban on Union recordings ordered by James Petrillo.

In May 1948, the singing duo of Jon and Sondra Steele released &quot;My Happiness&quot; on Damon Records, a fact that was acknowledged on sheet music promoting the song. One of the better known artists with Damon was big band bandleader Al Trace. The Al Trace Orchestra recorded for major labels in the 1940s in addition to Damon. Trace was a writer on several popular songs, including &quot;If I&#x27;d Known You Were Coming I&#x27;d Have Baked a Cake.&quot;

The label was still in existence up to at least 1960, when a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll group from Pittsburg, Kan., Conny and the Bellhops, had a regional hit with a 45 titled &quot;Shot Rod,&quot; an instrumental on the Damon label.

== Rebirth ==

*Damon was a Canadian music label during the 1970&#x27;s and 1980s. The Edmonton-based label released several notable artists including Juno nominee Jimmy Arthur Ordge, country singer-songwriter Jack Hennig, The Rodeo Song&#x27;s Garry Lee and the Showdown, Bob and Doug McKenzie&#x27;s 1981 The Great White North album, and polka great Bob Kames.
*In 2010, a small group of people &quot;relaunched&quot; Damon Records as an independent record label. The label&#x27;s primary genre focus is indie rock music, different from the types of music that the original Damon Records put out.

<text>AMM were a British free improvisation group that was founded in London, England, in 1965. The group was initially composed of Keith Rowe on guitar, Lou Gare on saxophone, and Eddie Prévost on drums. The three men shared an interest in exploring music beyond the boundaries of conventional jazz, as in free jazz and free improvisation. AMM never achieved widespread popularity, but have been influential in improvised music. Most of their albums have been released by Matchless Recordings, which is run by Eddie Prévost. In a 2001 interview, Keith Rowe was asked if &quot;AMM&quot; was an abbreviation. He replied, &quot;The letters AMM stand for something, but as you probably know it&#x27;s a secret!&quot;

== History ==
===1960s===
AMM was initially composed of Keith Rowe on guitar, Lou Gare on saxophone and Eddie Prévost on drums. Rowe and Gare were members of Mike Westbrook&#x27;s jazz band; Prévost and Gare were also in a hard bop jazz quintet. The three men shared a common interest in exploring music beyond the boundaries of conventional jazz, as part of a larger movement that helped spawn European free jazz and free improvisation.

The seeds of AMM were planted in 1965. They initially had no name, and were not really a group in the conventional sense, simply a weekend experimental workshop session at the Royal College of Art in London, centred on Gare, Rowe, and Prévost. Members of the group have come and gone over the years, but Rowe and Prévost have been present for most recordings and performances; the latter has been the only constant in the nearly six decades of AMM music.

Musicians were free to join in, but such collaborations were often short-lived if the contributions were lacking the proper spirit: notable jazz saxophonist Steve Lacy sat in with the group but was quickly asked to stop playing. Observers were welcome, provided they were silent and did not disturb the proceedings. American saxophonist Ornette Coleman was asked to leave after he continually talked during one performance; Beatles member Paul McCartney once sat quietly through an early AMM session. When asked how he liked the music he said they went on too long.

Eventually, the group settled on a line-up of Prévost, Rowe, Gare, bassist Lawrence Sheaff and pianist/cellist Cornelius Cardew, and, in early 1966, were calling themselves AMM. However, some early performances were billed as the &quot;Cornelius Cardew Quintet&quot;, a mistake which both irked and amused the musicians. After a few paying performances, Cardew bought two amplifiers so the other instruments could compete with the volume of Rowe&#x27;s guitar. In addition to amplifying their instruments, Cardew and Gare would apply contact microphones to various common objects to amplify the sounds made by, for example, rubbing a glass jar or striking a coffee tin.

No AMM performance is ever planned; each is unique and spontaneous. The musicians tend to avoid any conventional melody, harmony or rhythm, and seek out an ensemble sound that often obscures any individual&#x27;s role. It is often difficult to discern which musical instrument is making which specific sound on an AMM recording, due in part to liberal use of various extended techniques on their instruments.

AMM released their first recording, &quot;AMMusic 1966&quot;, on Elektra Records UK in 1966. It had some initial similarities to free jazz, due in part to Gare&#x27;s saxophone. One critic has written, however, that the resemblance was rather slight: &quot;the overall sound of the group, even in 1966, was so different, so idiosyncratic, that it&#x27;s not at all surprising that both new jazz and contemporary classical audiences were baffled, if not horrified.&quot; Percussionist Christopher Hobbs (born in 1950 and a student of Cardew) also played with AMM in the late 1960s.

The next AMM material to see release were the important &quot;The Crypt&quot; sessions from 12 June 1968. Though the debut is regarded as a landmark recording, &quot;The Crypt&quot; was arguably even more important in establishing the droning, long-form music that would come to characterise AMM. Further &quot;out&quot; and even less conventional than earlier material, one critic has written of it that &quot;an eerie sensation inevitably accompanies each listen to the raw streams of electric noise channeled on AMM&#x27;s second album and early masterpiece, &quot;The Crypt&quot;. To ears informed by the twenty-first century, it&#x27;s the uncanny feeling of listening to three-and-a-half decades of experimental music history as delivered in a chillingly prescient sort of reverse premonition ... It&#x27;s a little unnerving that the only records that seem to accurately describe the brave new soundworld harnessed on &quot;The Crypt&quot; came into being well after its creation.&quot;

&quot;The Crypt&quot; sessions have been issued many times, twice in the 1980s as a double LP, and it is still available (with extra material, billed as &quot;The Complete Sessions&quot;) on a double CD from Matchless Recordings. &quot;The Crypt&quot; continues to inspire adventurous listeners; in the liner notes to the 1992 double CD, Prévost writes, &quot;Despite being (arguably) the most &#x27;difficult&#x27; material on Matchless, &quot;The Crypt&quot; has been a mainstay for the label. It obviously pays not to underestimate the audience. Its continued success has enabled us to release other works. So we felt committed, obliged almost, to keep it available ... this music has proved itself not to be ephemeral.&quot;

Composer Cornelius Cardew joined AMM in 1966, performing on piano and cello. He worked with AMM intermittently until he abandoned his earlier experimental music in the late 1970s (Cardew died in an unsolved auto accident in 1981). Composer Christian Wolff performed with AMM in 1968. Cardew and Rowe became committed to socialism and to Maoism, and thought that AMM&#x27;s music should reflect their sociopolitical outlook. Prévost accuses the pair of &quot;cultural bullying&quot;, and there was tension in the group, resulting in some AMM performances being made by alternating duos: Rowe and Cardew, Prévost and Gare.

===1970s===
This personal and political tension culminated with a long period (about 1972 to 1976) when AMM was rarely active, and then usually as a Prévost-Gare duo. This was arguably AMM&#x27;s most jazz-like era, with Gare&#x27;s sputtering, squawking saxophone (unique but showing the influence of John Gilmore and Albert Ayler) brought to the fore, although Prévost has stated the music was &quot;decidedly non-jazz.&quot;
Rowe rejoined in the mid-1970s, and shortly thereafter, Gare departed, leaving a Rowe-Prévost duo for a period.

===1980s and 1990s===
Pianist John Tilbury – previously an occasional AMM collaborator – joined in about 1980. This version of AMM generally explored quieter, more meditative sounds. Gare occasionally rejoined the group in this era; cellist Rohan de Saram was also an occasional addition.

Later collaborators have included saxophonist Evan Parker and clarinetist Ian Mitchell. Christian Wolff also returned as a collaborator for a concert at the Conway Hall in London in 2001. Prévost has reported that of all their collaborators, Parker and Wolff best grasped the AMM aesthetic.

===2000s===
The Prévost/Rowe/Tilbury line-up remained stable for two decades, only occasionally augmented by guests. In the early 1990s, the trio made their first extensive tours, with a number of well-received appearances in Europe and North America.

But since about 2000, Rowe&#x27;s increasing involvement with what has become known as &quot;electroacoustic improvisation&quot; (&quot;eai&quot; for short), especially under the aegis of Jon Abbey&#x27;s Erstwhile Records, meant that more of his musical activities began to take place outside AMM. Rowe has reported that he felt somewhat limited having been almost exclusively a Matchless Records artist, and that he wanted to explore music outside of AMM. Tension between Rowe and Prévost was exacerbated by the appearance of Prévost&#x27;s second book of essays, &quot;Minute Particulars&quot;, which contained some disparaging comments about Rowe, who then left the group. In his review of Prévost&#x27;s book, Walter Horn notes that while Prévost offers often scathing opinions of many people, Rowe is singled out for multiple barbs, and &quot;one can hardly fail to wonder whether there&#x27;s something of a personal nature lurking behind the barrage of what are superficially theoretical complaints.&quot;

The trio&#x27;s last performance with Rowe is documented on the 2005 double-CD &quot;Apogee&quot;. The set is shared with another of the electronic improvisational ensembles that emerged during the 1960s: Musica Elettronica Viva (MEV). The first CD is a studio recording in a joint session in England on 30 April 2004 featuring MEV&#x27;s Alvin Curran, Richard Teitelbaum and Frederic Rzewski with Prévost-Rowe-Tilbury. This is the first occasion that the two ensembles have performed together, but not the first time they have shared a split release: each outfit filled a side of the LP &quot;Live Electronic Music Improvised&quot;, released on a US label in 1968 (AMM&#x27;s side features excerpts from &quot;The Crypt&quot; sessions; MEV&#x27;s side is an excerpt from their magnum opus &quot;Spacecraft.&quot;). The second CD consists of the performances that each group gave at a festival held in London on 1 May 2004.

Prévost and Tilbury continue to record and perform as AMM. They performed in London during December 2004, with Sachiko M joining as a guest, at the 2005 LMC Festival of Experimental Music, with David Jackman as a guest, and at a festival of experimental music in Belgium in February 2006. They also released a duo CD as AMM, &quot;Norwich&quot;, during 2005, and in 2009, the CD &quot;Trinity&quot; with guest John Butcher.
In 2010 the core duo of Eddie Prévost and John Tilbury along with John Butcher, Christian Wolff and Ute Kangiesser released a CD called &quot;Sounding Music&quot; (the first simply tagged as AMM after 2005&#x27;s Norwich) containing the concert performed at &quot;Freedom of the City&quot; festival, Conway Hall, London on 3 May 2009.

More recent recordings on Matchless featuring the duo form of AMM include: &#x27;Uncovered Correspondence&#x27; recorded in Jasło, Poland (2010) and &#x27;Two London Concerts&#x27; (2011).

AMM appeared on SWR2 NOWJazz Session, Donaueschingen 2012.

AMM (Tilbury, Prévost &amp; Rowe) appeared on 29 November 2015 as the final performance in the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival.

AMM disbanded in 2022, after playing their final performance at Cafe Oto on July 30.

<text>The Gardens of Lucullus () were the setting for an ancient villa on the Pincian Hill on the edge of Rome; they were laid out by Lucius Licinius Lucullus about 60 BC. The Villa Borghese gardens still cover of green on the site, now in the heart of Rome, above the Spanish Steps.

==Description==

The fabled gardens of Lucullus were among the most influential in the history of gardening. Lucullus had first-hand experience of the Persian gardening style, in the satraps&#x27; gardens of Anatolia (&quot;Asia&quot; to the Romans) and in Mesopotamia and Persia itself. As Plutarch pointed out, &quot;Lucullus [was] the first Roman who carried an army over Taurus, passed the Tigris, took and burnt the royal palaces of Asia in the sight of the kings, Tigranocerta, Cabira, Sinope, and Nisibis, seizing and overwhelming the northern parts as far as the Phasis, the east as far as Media, and making the South and Red Sea his own through the kings of the Arabians.&quot; These comments indicate that it was well understood in Rome that this new luxury of gardening originated in Persia.

Lucullus&#x27;s rural villas in the hills at Tusculum, near modern Frascati, and at Naples were also set in lavish garden settings. Plutarch, in &#x27;Lucullus&#x27; ch. 37, mentions &quot;the chambers and galleries, with their sea-views, built at Naples by Lucullus, out of the spoils of the barbarians.&quot;, and Pliny writes of Lucullus cutting a channel through a mountain on his Naples estate to allow seawater to circulate in his fishpond, which recalled the channel that had been cut through the isthmus at Mount Athos by the Persian king. Because of the massive piles which he built in the sea at his villa in Naples, Pompey mockingly nicknamed Lucullus &quot;the Roman Xerxes&quot;, and Tubero called him &quot;Xerxes in a toga&quot;. 

Plutarch, like most of Lucullus&#x27;s Roman contemporaries, thought these occupations of Lucullus&#x27;s retirement unbecoming to a Roman, and mere play:
Though a &quot;Lucullan feast&quot; has passed into proverb, Lucullus was not a mere conspicuous consumer. He formed a fine library and kept it open to scholars, wrote himself and supported writers. His garden was filled with works of art, particularly Greek sculpture, both originals and copies of “old masters”, and has thus been a rich archaeological source of ancient sculpture: for example, the statue of the &quot;Scythian knife sharpener&quot; (now thought to depict the executioner getting ready to flay Marsyas) which the Medici removed to Florence was found in this garden.

==Later history==

The gardens became the favourite playground of Claudius&#x27;s Empress Messalina (after she forced the then owner, Valerius Asiaticus, to commit suicide – Tac. Annals XI.1), and was the site of her murder in 48 AD on the orders of the Emperor Claudius, her husband. From shortly afterwards, in around 55 AD, mosaics excavated in the gardens have provided the earliest known use of tesserae made with the technique of gold sandwich glass, which was to remain an essential component of Byzantine and Western mosaics. In the 16th century they were owned by Felice della Rovere, daughter of Pope Julius II. The Villa Borghese portion was a vineyard in 160–5, when it was returned to be a grand garden.

<text>Elis Regina Carvalho Costa (March 17, 1945 – January 19, 1982), known professionally as Elis Regina (), was a Brazilian singer of Bossa nova, MPB and jazz music. She is also the mother of the singers Maria Rita and Pedro Mariano.

She became nationally renowned in 1965 after singing &quot;Arrastão&quot; (composed by Edu Lobo and Vinícius de Moraes) in the first edition of TV Excelsior festival song contest and soon joined &quot;O Fino da Bossa&quot;, a television program on TV Record. She was noted for her vocalization as well as for her interpretation and performances in shows. Her recordings include &quot;Como Nossos Pais&quot; (Belchior), &quot;Upa Neguinho&quot; (E. Lobo and Gianfrancesco Guarnieri), &quot;Madalena&quot; (Ivan Lins), &quot;Casa no Campo&quot; (Zé Rodrix and Tavito), &quot;Águas de março&quot; (Tom Jobim), &quot;Atrás da Porta&quot; (Chico Buarque and Francis Hime), &quot;O Bêbado e a Equilibrista&quot; (Aldir Blanc and João Bosco), &quot;Conversando no Bar&quot; (Milton Nascimento).

Her death, at the age of 36, shocked Brazil.

==Biography==

Elis Regina was born in Porto Alegre, where she began her career as a singer at an early age on the children&#x27;s radio show &quot;Clube de Guri&quot;. In her early teens she signed a record contract and a couple years later traveled to Rio de Janeiro, where she recorded her first album. She won her first festival song contest in 1965 singing &quot;Arrastão&quot; (&quot;Pull the Trawling Net&quot;) by Edu Lobo and Vinícius de Moraes, which made her the biggest selling Brazilian recording artist since Carmen Miranda. Her second album, &quot;Dois na Bossa&quot; with Jair Rodrigues, set a national sales record and became the first Brazilian album to sell over one million copies. &quot;Arrastão&quot; increased her popularity because the festival was broadcast via TV and radio. The record represented the beginning of música popular brasileira (Brazilian popular music) and contrasted with bossa nova. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she helped popularize tropicalismo with Gal Costa, Gilberto Gil, and Caetano Veloso.
In 1970 she had her first son with first husband Ronaldo Bôscoli. Later on she had two more children with musician Cesar Camargo Mariano.

Regina was nicknamed &quot;hurricane&quot; and &quot;little pepper&quot;. She moved to Rio around the time Brazil was ruled by a military group. Although her popularity protected her from reprisal when she criticized the regime while on tour in Europe, she was threatened with imprisonment unless she sang the Brazilian national anthem at an event honoring the anniversary of the coup. In the 1970s she recorded the album &quot;Elis and Tom&quot; in Los Angeles with Antonio Carlos Jobim. In 1982 she was starting her third marriage when she died from a combination of alcohol and cocaine at the age of thirty-six.

==Death==
On January 19, 1982, Regina died at the age of 36, from cardiac arrest, after consuming vermouth, cocaine and tranquilizers. More than 15,000 fans attended a musical wake in the Teatro Bandeirantes in São Paulo. She was buried in Cemitério do Morumbi.

== Legacy ==
On August 18, 1997 Regina was posthumously awarded with the rank of the Order of Prince Henry of Portugal. 

In 2005, a memorial space was opened at the Casa de Cultura Mario Quintana in Porto Alegre, Brazil to house the Elis Regina Collection. The space exhibits audiovisuals, CDs, articles and other media materials and documents about the life and work of Regina.

Regina was portrayed by Andréia Horta in the 2016 movie &quot;Elis&quot; directed by Hugo Prata.

<doc id="336376" wikidata="Q2776735" url="?curid=336376" title="Operation Assaf">
<text>Operation Assaf (, &quot;Mivtza Asaf&quot;) was an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operation against the Egyptian Army between December 5–December 7, 1948, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The successful operation&#x27;s aim was to take control of the western Negev Desert. It was a small operation, executed between two larger operations in that theatre, Operation Yoav and Operation Horev.
== Background ==

Following Operation Yoav, the Egyptian Army tried to stabilize a defensive line between its two arms of controlled territory in the Negev, along the Beer Sheva-Gaza road. With international peace-efforts intensifying, both sides felt that the war was drawing to a close, and such a strong defensive line would help Egypt claim the majority of western and southern Negev, which included some Israeli settlements.

Israel wished to disconnect the two Egyptian arms before it could construct and man strong fortifications along the new defense line. So, Operation Assaf was planned and carried out starting December 5, just two weeks after Operation Yoav ended. In order to surprise the defenders, IDF units were transported via the newly captured Beer Sheva to the Egyptian Army&#x27;s southern (rear) flank, and attacked &quot;northwards&quot; (the Egyptians expected attacks from the north and east).

== Participating forces ==
The operation was carried out mainly with the Golani Brigade&#x27;s Gideon Battalion infantry forces, for whom this was the first operation in southern Israel or in flat desert terrain (Golani was normally stationed in the lush and hilly Upper Galilee region, near the Golan Heights for which it is named). In addition, the assault battalion and several armoured personnel carriers from the armored battalion, both of the 8th Armored Brigade, participated in combat. A few artillery and mortar batteries assisted them.

The main assaults were carried out by the mechanized forces, while Golani&#x27;s infantry came in the second wave to cleanse and defend newly captured positions.

== Operational phases ==
Phase 1, went according to plan, with IDF forces capturing three important Egyptian positions without major combat or casualties, on the operation&#x27;s first day (December 5, 1948).

Phase 2, carried out on the following day (December 6, 1948) captured another important position, thus completing all the operation&#x27;s objectives. However, the Israelis met stronger resistance at another position (which was not captured) and were forced to stop their advance when they hit a minefield in another location.

On the same day, the Egyptians counter-attacked the captured positions from their main positions in the west, with an infantry battalion, a tank company and some accurate artillery. The attack came very close to breaking the Israeli defenders, but broke off at dusk. Later data indicated that this was the Egyptian tank battalion&#x27;s first combat action, after having arrived from Egypt barely two weeks earlier. It had lost 5 of its 12 attacking tanks on that day (number of casualties unknown); Five Israelis were killed in the counter-attack and 28 were wounded.

The Egyptians made preparations to continue the counter-attack on the afternoon of the following day (December 7). However, Israeli Air Force reconnaissance revealed the Egyptian preparations in the morning. The Israeli assault battalion was sent to the Egyptian&#x27;s north (left) flank and stormed their forces southwards, then chased the retreating Egyptians westward, eventually stopping in face of strong anti-tank Egyptian positions. It was reported that a hundred Egyptian soldiers were left dead in the wake of the assault; the Israelis had 2 wounded and none killed.

During the next week, the Israeli forces cleared the area&#x27;s minefields, dug defensive fortifications, and harassed nearby Egyptian forces, before being pulled out of the region in preparations for Operation Horev.

<text>Caterina Irene Elena Maria Boyle, Lady Saunders (; 29 May 1926 – 20 March 2018), usually known as Katie Boyle, was an Italian-born British actress, writer, radio announcer and television personality. She became best known for presenting the Eurovision Song Contest on a record four occasions: in , , and ; the first three in London and the last in Brighton, England. She was also an agony aunt, answering problems that had been posted by readers of the &quot;TVTimes&quot;.

==Early life, modelling and film career==
She was born on 29 May 1926 in a royal palace in Florence, Tuscany, Italy, which had once belonged to the Italian royal family, the daughter of an Italian marquis (the Marchese Demetrio Imperiali di Francavilla) and his English wife, Dorothy Kate Ramsden. She came to the United Kingdom in 1946 and started a modelling career, which included work for such publications as &quot;Vogue&quot;. She also appeared in several 1950s films, the first being &quot;Old Mother Riley Headmistress&quot; (1950) in which she was billed as Catherine Carleton, followed by &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Forget You&quot; (uncredited, 1951), &quot;The Diary of Major Thompson&quot; (filmed in France in 1955), &quot;Not Wanted on Voyage&quot; (1957), &quot;The Truth About Women&quot; (also 1957) and &quot;Intent to Kill&quot; (1958).

==Radio and television==

Boyle was an on-screen continuity announcer for the BBC in the 1950s. A decade later she became a television personality, regularly appearing on panel games and programmes such as &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; and the medical game show &quot;Lance That Boyle&quot;, on which she appeared with comedian Lance Percival. Boyle was the presenter for the , , and Eurovision Song Contests (all of which were hosted in the UK), making her the person who presented the most editions of the contest. She hosted the 1974 contest wearing no underwear; it had been cut off from under her satin dress moments before the broadcast began. She also hosted the UK qualifying heat, &quot;A Song for Europe&quot;, in 1961. In the 1960s she appeared in a long-running series of television advertisements for Camay soap.

Boyle was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1982, when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews while in Rome. That same year she played herself in the BBC radio play &quot;The Competition&quot;, which told the story of a fictitious international song contest being staged in Bridlington. Boyle was guest of honour at the Eurovision fan club conventions staged in 1988 and 1992, and appeared at the Eurovision Song Contest 1998 held in Birmingham as a special guest of the BBC. Her other work has included theatre, television (&quot;What&#x27;s Up Dog?&quot;) and radio (&quot;Katie and Friends&quot;). In 2004 Boyle was a guest on a special Eurovision-themed celebrity version of &quot;Weakest Link&quot; on BBC One, hosted by Anne Robinson. Boyle became the first, and to date the only, contestant ever to vote herself off the programme.

==Personal life==

In 1947, she married The Hon. Richard Bentinck Boyle, a captain in the Irish Guards and heir to the 8th Earl of Shannon; the marriage was dissolved in 1955 but she kept his surname, Boyle. Later that year, she married Greville Baylis, a racehorse owner, who died in 1976. In 1979, she married theatre impresario Sir Peter Saunders, who died in 2003. 

A book by Nicholas Davies, &quot;Queen Elizabeth II: A Woman Who Is Not Amused&quot;, alleged that Boyle had a long-standing relationship with Prince Philip in the 1950s. Boyle told Gyles Brandreth: &quot;It&#x27;s ludicrous, pure fabrication. When it appears in print, people believe it. You can&#x27;t take legal action because it fans the flames, so you just have to accept people telling complete lies about you.&quot; She was represented for most of her working life by agent Bunny Lewis. A keen owner of Yorkshire terriers, she was a committee member of Battersea Dogs Home for more than 25 years. She died at home in London on 20 March 2018, aged 91, from pneumonia and cerebrovascular disease.

==Alternative crediting==
She was also credited as Catherine Boyle and Catherine Boyl.

<doc id="336378" wikidata="Q3924724" url="?curid=336378" title="Provo Wallis">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet Sir Provo William Parry Wallis, (12 April 1791 – 13 February 1892) was a Royal Navy officer. As a junior officer, following the capture of USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; by the frigate during the War of 1812, the wounding of HMS &quot;Shannon&quot;″s captain and the death of her first lieutenant in the action, he served as the temporary captain of HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; as she returned to Halifax, Nova Scotia, with &quot;Chesapeake&quot;.

As commanding officer of the fifth-rate , Wallis earned the thanks of the people of Veracruz in Mexico when he protected them from French bombardment during the Pastry War. He went on to be Senior Naval Officer, Gibraltar, and then Commander-in-Chief on the South East Coast of America Station. Wallis was promoted to senior flag officer positions and was still carried on the active list at 100 years old when he died.

==Early career==

He was the son of Provo Featherstone Wallis, a clerk at the Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax, Nova Scotia, by his wife Elizabeth Lawlor. Wallis benefited from his father&#x27;s desire to secure a naval career for his son. Knowing the rules for an officer&#x27;s entry into the navy, his father managed to get him officially registered in May 1795, at the age of four, as an able seaman on the 36-gun frigate HMS &quot;Oiseau&quot;, under Captain Robert Murray.

In May 1798, young Provo became a volunteer in the 40-gun frigate where he remained (on paper at least) until September 1799 when he joined the 64-gun third-rate . He served on HMS &quot;Asia&quot; until September 1800, when he was promoted to midshipman in the 32-gun fifth-rate . HMS &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was the first ship he physically served aboard – he physically joined the ship in October 1804 – but by now he had amassed nearly a decade of seniority. In an action on 16 February 1805, HMS &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was captured by the French frigate &quot;Ville de Milan&quot; and the ship&#x27;s company taken prisoner of war. Wallis was freed a week later when &quot;Ville de Milan&quot; was itself captured by the Royal Navy: he transferred to &quot;Ville de Milan&quot; which now became a British ship.

Wallis transferred to the third-rate in November 1806 and to the third-rate in February 1808 and, having been promoted to lieutenant on 13 November 1808, he transferred again to the sloop-of-war later that month. HMS &quot;Curieux&quot; ran aground and was wrecked on the coast of Guadeloupe in November 1809 and Wallis transferred to the fifth-rate in December 1809. He subsequently served in the sloops HMS &quot;Observateur&quot;, and .

Wallis transferred to the 38-gun frigate in January 1812. HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; captured USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; near Boston on 1 June 1813, during the War of 1812: HMS &quot;Shannon&quot;″s Captain, Philip Broke, was badly wounded during the action and her first lieutenant was killed.

Wallis served as the temporary captain of the British frigate for a period of exactly six days as she made her way back to Halifax, Nova Scotia, with &quot;Chesapeake&quot; flying the Blue Ensign above the Stars and Stripes, for which action he was promoted to commander on 9 July 1813.

Wallis was given command of the sloop at Sheerness in January 1814. Promoted to captain on 12 August 1819, he became commanding officer of the sixth-rate at Halifax in June 1824 and commanding officer of the fifth-rate on the North America and West Indies Station in April 1838. He earned the thanks of the people of Veracruz in Mexico when he protected them from French bombardment in Winter 1838 during the Pastry War.

Appointed as commodore (but remaining a post captain in substantive rank) he went on to be Senior Naval Officer, Gibraltar, with his broad pennant of the third-rate , in October 1843.

==Senior command==
Promoted to rear-admiral on 27 August 1851, Wallis became Commander-in-Chief, South East Coast of America Station, with his flag in the third-rate , in May 1857 but only held the command until September 1857. He was promoted to vice-admiral on 10 September 1857, appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 18 May 1860 and promoted to admiral on 2 March 1863. He was appointed Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom on 17 July 1869 and Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom on 12 February 1870.

In order to prevent admirals from dying as paupers, a special clause in the retirement scheme of 1870 provided that those officers who had commanded a ship before the end of the Napoleonic Wars should be retained on the active list: the six days Wallis was in command of HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; qualified him to remain on the active list until he died. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 24 May 1873 and promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 11 December 1875. The Admiralty suggested he retire when he reached his late nineties, as being on the active list meant he was liable for calling up for a seagoing command. Wallis instead replied he was ready to accept one.

Wallis died at his country home in Funtington in West Sussex on 13 February 1892 and was buried in St Mary&#x27;s churchyard at Funtington. He was only a few months short of his 101st birthday with a combined service of 96 years from the time his name first appeared on the books of a Royal Navy ship. He was the last survivor of the action between HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; and USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, and on his death, four admirals below him on the active list were able to gain immediate promotion.

==Family==
On 17 October 1817 Wallis married Juliana Massey; they had two daughters. Following the death of his first wife, he married Jemima Wilson, daughter of Sir Robert Wilson, on 21 July 1849.

==Legacy==
Wallis House in Ottawa is named after Wallis; the City of Ottawa has erected brass plaques, which were unveiled in 1990 and 1997 documenting the history of the building. The former Canadian Coast Guard Ship was also named after him. The main street in the Naval dockyard of Halifax, Nova Scotia, is also named &quot;Provo Wallis Street&quot; in his honour.

<text>Broadcast Twelve Records was a United Kingdom based record label introduced in 1928 to partner the regular &quot;Broadcast&quot; brand records introduced in 1927. These brands replaced the Aco Records label. The manufacturer of the discs were the Vocalion Gramophone Company. &quot;Broadcast&quot; discs were 8-inch (later increased to 9-inch) and &quot;Broadcast Twelve&quot; discs were 10-inch 78rpm gramophone records, but with small labels and a fine groove pitch so they would play as long as regular 10- and 12-inch discs respectively. They ceased production in 1934.

The label was a subsidiary of the British branch of Vocalion Records. A full listing of Broadcast records was published by the City of London Phonograph and Gramophone Society CLPGS in 2017.

<text>The Palace of the Republic (, ) was a building in Berlin that hosted the &quot;Volkskammer&quot;, the parliament of East Germany, from 1976 to 1990.

Also known as the &quot;People&#x27;s Palace&quot;, it was located across the Unter den Linden from Museum Island in the Mitte area of East Berlin, on the site of the former Berlin Palace between the Lustgarten and Schlossplatz, near the West Berlin border. The palace was completed in 1976 to house the &quot;Volkskammer&quot;, also serving various cultural purposes including two large auditoria, art galleries, a theatre, a cinema, 13 restaurants, five beer halls, a bowling alley, billiards rooms, a rooftop ice skating rink, a private gym with spa, a casino, a medical station, a post office, a police station with an underground cellblock, an indoor basketball court, an indoor swimming pool, private barbershops and salons, public and private restrooms and a discothèque. In the early 1980s, one of the restaurants was replaced by a video game arcade for children of &quot;Volkskammer&quot; members and staff.

In 1990, the palace became vacant following German reunification and was closed for health and safety reasons, due to there being more than 5,000 tonnes of asbestos in the building (despite asbestos having been outlawed in construction in East Germany in 1968). In 2003, the Bundestag voted for the demolition of the palace and replacement with a reconstruction of the Berlin Palace which had been demolished in the 1950s, after being heavily damaged by Allied air raids. The building was demolished between 2006 and 2008, and the reconstruction of the Berlin Palace began in 2013 and was completed in 2020.

== History ==
=== Construction ===
Construction of the Palace of the Republic () began in 1973, with a cost stated at 485 million East German marks according to an internal list of Wolfgang Junker, the Minister of Construction, although other estimates suggest about 800 million to 1 billion marks. It was built on the site of the Berlin Palace (&quot;Stadtschloss&quot;), the former royal palace of Prussia, located on Museum Island in East Berlin, less than along Unter den Linden from the West Berlin border at the Brandenburg Gate. The Berlin Palace had been controversially demolished in 1950 after suffering extensive damage during the Battle of Berlin in World War II, as the government had no budget in the post-war years for the restoration and it was viewed as a symbol of Prussian imperialism. The site was used as a parade ground and parking lot during the 1950s and 1960s until its designation as the location for a new building to seat the &quot;Volkskammer&quot;, the unicameral legislature of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which was provisionally seated at the Langenbeck-Virchow-Haus at 58/59 Luisenstraße.

The palace was designed in a modernist style by Heinz Graffunder and the Building Academy of the GDR (&quot;Bauakademie der DDR&quot;), with distinctive bronze-mirrored windows as a defining architectural feature. It consisted of two massive outer blocks and a middle piece inserted between them, which together gave the building the shape of a cuboid with a length of , a width of , and a height of which was based on that of the neighbouring buildings. The new building took up the eastern half of the plot while the western half was intended as a military parade ground, though tremors from the heavy vehicles were found to endanger the glass façade on the unstable grounds of Museum Island. Instead, the western half was used mainly as a parking lot and military parades were moved to Karl-Marx-Allee.

In addition to housing the &quot;Volkskammer&quot;, the palace was intended as a multiple-use structure influenced by the concepts of Palaces of Culture and People&#x27;s Houses popular with socialist movements. Such cultural buildings were common not only in the Eastern Bloc, but also find examples in Belgium, France (Centre Georges Pompidou), the Netherlands and Sweden (House of Culture in Stockholm). In the young Soviet Union in particular, cultural centers became symbols of the new state power. The palace contained a large bowling alley at the lower level, from which the canal-side terrace along the River Spree could be accessed, and featured Brunswick lane equipment and a bar. The part of the palace open to the public featured numerous cameras for the surveillance of staff and visitors by Stasi officials. It was the first building in the GDR to feature a self-supporting steel skeleton and contained 5,000 tons of asbestos used for fire protection.

===Seat of the &quot;Volkskammer&quot;===

The palace was officially opened on 23 April 1976 and its facilities were opened to the public two days later.

Numerous important cultural, political, academic, and social events of the German Democratic Republic occurred at the palace after its opening. Events were held in its Great Hall, a large hexagonal room some wide and high. The Great Hall was notable for its versatility; lifting devices under the floor allowed for a stage of variable height and size. The surface area of the stage could therefore range anywhere from , and the hall could seat between 1,000 and 4,500 attendants. Many editions of the GDR television entertainment program &quot;Ein Kessel Buntes&quot; were recorded in the Great Hall. Concerts of famous orchestras such as the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig under Kurt Masur, modern interpretations of classical music such as the &quot;Messiah&quot; of George Frideric Handel, and performances by Bulat Okudzhava (29 November 1976), Harry Belafonte (25 October 1983), Karel Gott (1983), 1986 with Dara Rolins and Heidi Janků, 1987) or of the rock-band Purple Schulz (21 January 1989). German electronic music group Tangerine Dream performed a concert recorded live at the palace on 31 January 1980 which also was Johannes Schmoelling&#x27;s first live performance with the band. Erich Honecker, Willi Stoph and other members of the Central Committee were in attendance. The concert was unique in that Tangerine Dream was the first Western group who was allowed by the GDR government to play in East Berlin at the time and was dubbed &quot;the performance behind the Iron Curtain&quot;. An album of this recorded concert was released titled &quot;Quichotte&quot; on East German record label Amiga, and later released to the rest of the world on Virgin Records six years later and renamed &quot;Pergamon&quot;. In October 1983, the West German rock star Udo Lindenberg was permitted to perform in concert at the palace. At the concert, Lindenberg did not sing one of his best-known songs, &quot;Sonderzug nach Pankow&quot; (&quot;Special Train to Pankow&quot;), which satirized East German leader Erich Honecker, as he was ordered not to play it under threat of arrest and imprisonment by the Stasi. Additionally, in April 1987, American Latin rock band Santana performed two concerts here.

The Socialist Unity Party (SED), the ruling party of the GDR, held party congresses at the palace and a state gala was held on the eve of the 40th (and final) anniversary of the GDR in October 1989, at which Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was present. During the night of 22–23 August 1990, the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; decided in the palace on the accession of the GDR to the Federal Republic of Germany with effect from 3 October 1990, known as German reunification.

The palace had many nicknames in the Springer press in West Berlin and among East German citizens, such as &quot;Palazzo Prozzo&quot; (a wordplay, as &#x27;protzen&#x27; means &#x27;to show off ostentatiously&#x27;) or &quot;Erichs Lampenladen&quot; (Erich Honecker&#x27;s lamp shop - a pun on the many tall chandeliers inside it). &quot;Ballast der Republik&quot; (Ballast having the same meaning as in English - burden) was popular as well.

===Closure and demolition===
The palace was closed to the public on 19 September 1990 by decree of the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; when it was found to be contaminated by asbestos, only two weeks before the accession date. On 2 October 1990, the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; was dissolved and the palace became vacant. By 2003, the asbestos was considered to have been removed along with internal and external fittings allowing either safe reconstruction or safe deconstruction, and the shell of the building was opened for visitors in mid-2003. In November 2003, the Bundestag decided to demolish the palace and reconstruct the Berlin Palace, leaving the area as parkland until funding could be found. The majority of former East Germans opposed the demolition and various protests were held by people who felt the building was an integral part of Berlin&#x27;s culture and the historic process of the German reunification.

Beginning in early 2004, the palace was used for events, such as housing an exhibition of the Terracotta Army and a special concert by the famous Berlin-based band Einstürzende Neubauten. Afterward, the palace fell into disuse and disrepair. Demolition started on 6 February 2006, and was scheduled to last about 15 months at a cost of €12 million; however, the demolition was delayed after more asbestos was discovered in various locations, and the estimated completion date was pushed back to the end of 2008. About 35,000 tonnes of steel which once held the building together were shipped to the United Arab Emirates to be used for the construction of the Burj Khalifa. Although the original structure in Berlin has been demolished, its sister building, the Kulturpalast in Dresden, is still intact and currently used as a symphony orchestra hall.

===Berlin Palace reconstruction===
In January 2006, about two years after the Bundestag decided for the rebuilding of the Berlin Palace, a second definitive vote re-approved the plans. It was decided three of its sides would be exact replicas of the original, but the fourth side and interior would be modern. Called the Humboldtforum, the rebuilt palace houses the Humboldt collection and gallery of non-European art. In November 2008, the Italian architect Francesco Stella was chosen for the project. Reconstruction began in 2015 and was completed in 2020. The building was opened to the public in 2021. Some items from the Palace of the Republic are on display, such as globe chandeliers and an original sign.

== Artworks ==
Sixteen monumental pictures by GDR artists (Walter Womacka, Willi Sitte, Wolfgang Mattheuer, Werner Tübke, and Bernhard Heisig) presented &quot;Dreams of Communists&quot;. The pictures were shown in Potsdam 20 years later.

<text>The 1st &quot;Golani&quot; Brigade (, &quot;Hativat Golani&quot;) is an Israeli military infantry brigade. It is subordinated to the 36th Division and traditionally associated with the Northern Command. It is one of the five infantry brigades of the regular Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the others being the Paratroopers Brigade, the Nahal Brigade, the Givati Brigade and the Kfir Brigade. Its symbol is a green olive tree against a yellow background, with its soldiers wearing a brown beret. It is one of the most highly decorated infantry units in the IDF. The brigade consists of five battalions, including two which it kept from its inception (12th and 13th), one transferred from the Givati Brigade (51st).

The brigade was formed on February 22, 1948, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, when the Levanoni Brigade in the Galilee split into the 1st Golani Brigade and the 2nd Carmeli Brigade. It has since participated in all of Israel&#x27;s major wars and nearly all major operations, including the Suez Crisis, the Six-Day War, the War of Attrition, the Yom Kippur War, Operation Entebbe, the 1978 South Lebanon conflict, the 1982 and 2006 Lebanon Wars, and various operations during the Palestinian intifadas.

Three of its commanders (Mordechai Gur, Gabi Ashkenazi and Gadi Eizenkot) have become IDF Chiefs of Staff, with many more reaching the rank of aluf (major general).

==History==

===Founding and initial organization===
As the end of the British Mandate of Palestine was fast approaching, the leadership of the Haganah drafted Plan Dalet for its subsequent organization and operations. The plan divided the fighting militia (Field Corps) into six regional brigades – Levanoni in the north, Alexandroni in the Sharon region, Kiryati in the Tel Aviv area, Givati in the Shfela, and Etzioni in the Jerusalem area. On February 28, 1948, the Levanoni Brigade was split into two—Carmeli in the northwest, and Golani in the northeast.

Golani&#x27;s area of operations included much of the Lower Galilee and Jezreel Valley, the Jordan Valley and the Hula Valley. It extended to al-Jalama and Bat Shlomo in the west. Major population centers included Safed, Tiberias, Beit She&#x27;an and Nazareth. The new brigade had five battalions, with its headquarters in Yavne&#x27;el:
===War of Independence===

During the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, Golani mostly participated in the battles for the mixed cities in the north, such as the Battle of Tiberias and battles in Safed in April–May 1948. The 12th Battalion captured al-Shajara on May 6, 1948, and the 13th captured Beit She&#x27;an on May 12. After these operations, responsibility over the northeastern part of the brigade&#x27;s sector (the Tel Hai area, 11th Battalion), was handed over to the Oded Brigade and other forces. In December 1948, the 14th and 15th battalions were merged into the Mechanized Attack Battalion.

The first Golani action following the Arab intervention in the 1948 war was the defense of the kibbutzim Degania Alef and Bet from the Syrian Army in the Battles of the Kinarot Valley. Units from the Barak Battalion, with Yiftach (Palmach) and Guard Corps reinforcements, successfully fended off a Syrian attack. The brigade was also successful at repelling Iraqi forces at the Battle of Gesher to the south. After the Jordan Valley battles died out, Golani went on the offensive, attacking a number of Arab villages in its sector, and finally mounting an offensive on Jenin together with the Carmeli Brigade on June 2, 1948. The attack eventually succeeded, but Jenin was retaken by the Iraqi Army shortly after.

During the Battles of the Ten Days between the first and second truces of the war (July 8–18, 1948), Golani managed to repel the Arab Liberation Army attack on Sejera from Lubya, and helped capture Nazareth and eventually Lubya in Operation Dekel. Golani participated in Operation Hiram in October 1948, where at first it staged diversionary attacks from the south. Afterwards captured Eilabun, Mughar, Rameh and other villages in the ALA First Yarmouk Battalion&#x27;s zone.

In December 1948, the brigade was largely transferred to the south in preparation for Operation Horev. Golani fought the Egyptians in the Gaza Strip, in Operation Assaf, the Battle of Hill 86 and later battles around Rafah. In March 1949, the brigade was tasked with capturing Umm Rashrash, today Eilat, with the 7th Armored Brigade. Golani advanced through the Arabah region in the east and arrived at the location two hours after the 7th. This was the last operation of the war.

===Border Raids and Suez Crisis===
After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Golani Brigade participated in a number of reprisal raids in the first part of the 1950s. In 1951, a Syrian patrol entered the demilitarized zone near Tel Mutilla, and was attacked by reservist IDF troops. Golani reinforced a reserve battalion and entered a battle that lasted five days, costing the brigade 40 dead and 72 wounded. The battle caused a number of changes in the IDF doctrine and was a catalyst for the creation of Unit 101. On October 28, 1955, after a border incident with Egypt around the Auja al-Hafir demilitarized zone, Golani was tasked with leading Operation Volcano, an attack on the Egyptian army in the area and the largest military operation at the time since the 1948 war.

In the Suez Crisis of 1956, the brigade&#x27;s task was to capture the area around the city Rafah. The 51st Battalion, formerly of Givati, led the assault on the Rafah Junction. They were ordered to abandon their vehicles after reaching a minefield and coming under fire from Egyptian artillery, although the battalion&#x27;s sappers slowly created a way forward for a line of vehicles and the battalion captured the intended Egyptian positions. The 12th Battalion captured positions on the Rafah – Khan Yunis road, and the 13th—positions south of Rafah.

In early 1960, after a border incident on the backdrop of the Israeli–Syrian water dispute, Golani destroyed the abandoned village al-Tawafiq, which overlooked Tel Katzir and was used by the Syrians as a military base. In March 1962, Golani launched Operation Swallow against the Syrians at Nuqeib on the east bank of the Sea of Galilee, in response to constant Syrian harassment of Israeli fishermen in the lake. In May 1965, as part of a larger operation, Golani conducted a raid on Shunat Nimrin in Jordan.

===Six-Day War===
On June 7, 1967, Golani units joined Israeli armored units in its assault on Nablus, capturing the city by 15:00. The remainder of the brigade was kept in the north for the planned thrust against the Syrian army on the Golan Heights. Planning called for the 12th Battalion to capture Tel Faher and Burj Babil, Banias, Tel Hamra and Ayn Fit. The 51st took Bahriat, Tel Azaziat and Khirbet as-Suda. The 13th Battalion was left as an operational reserve in the northeastern tip of Israel.

On June 9, the 51st Battalion crossed the border and advanced north along the Syrian patrol road. Its 3rd Company turned west to find Bahriat abandoned, while 2nd Company turned west and flanked Tel Azaziyat. The soldiers drove into a minefield and were forced to abandon their half-tracks, advancing to the trenches of Tel Azaziyat on foot. The battle continued from 16:21 to 17:06, ending in a Syrian surrender. At 16:46, 3rd Company captured Khirbet as-Suda, along with a T-54 tank. Meanwhile, the 12th Battalion split up to assault Burj Babil and Tel Faher. The forces at Tel Faher met stiff resistance and the 2nd Company now in Burj Babil was called to assist them. By 16:20, the southern position at Tel Faher had been taken. At 17:30, the Golani reconnaissance company came from the southeast to reinforce the 12th. By 18:20, Tel Faher was in Israeli hands.

The 13th Battalion was called to help the 8th Brigade which was operating in the same area. They helped capture a position north of Za&#x27;ura, and the village Jbab al-Mis to the south. Just before dawn, the 51st assaulted Banias and captured it. Reinforcements from the 45th Brigade captured Tel Hamra slightly to the north. During the course of the war, the Golani Brigade suffered 59 dead and 160 wounded, of them 23 in the Battle of Tel Faher.

===Counter-terror activities===
After the Six-Day War, the activity in northern Israel where Golani was based was mostly limited to raids against fedayeen (guerrilla) bases in Jordan, Lebanon and the West Bank, now under Israeli control. The objectives of these raids was to undermine the fedayeen bases in order to prevent attacks against Israelis. The three main raids against Jordan during this period were: the attack on the village Wadi al-Yabis across the river from Tirat Tzvi; the attack on the Cones Position across from Ashdot Ya&#x27;akov; and the attack on the Jordanian Ghor canal and defensive line.

The raid on Wadi al-Yabis, code-named Operation Asuta 12, was carried out by the Golani reconnaissance unit and the 12th Battalion on May 4, 1969. The forces did not meet any resistance and returned after completing the mission of destroying a number of structures. The Cone Position, named after a cone-shaped building on the premises, was attacked by the reconnaissance unit in July 1969. The guerrillas fled, but alerted the Jordanians who opened artillery fire on the Israelis. After blowing up two bunkers, the Israelis returned. 

The destruction of the Ghor canal was a punitive measure against the Jordanian farmers of the area, from where numerous guerrilla attacks against Israeli farmers were initiated. The three positions defending it did not notice the Israeli forces. While the attack did not go as planned when the bombs laid near the canal were detonated prematurely, it was destroyed and the water drained into the Yarmouk River.

On the Lebanese front, Golani participated in numerous raids into southern and eastern Lebanon. In October 1969, the brigade&#x27;s forces attacked Itarun (Operation Double Bass 1), Tel Sadr al-Arus and &#x27;Arab Zahiran. Twenty-four buildings were destroyed across the three villages. Another operation, Double Bass 10, involved a retaliatory raid on Kfar Kila on January 2, 1970, in response to the kidnapping of an elderly guard from Metula by Fatah two days earlier. Another retaliatory strike came on December 27, 1970, against the village Yatar, a major guerrilla base. 

A major attack was carried out in response to the 1972 Munich Massacre. On September 16, 1972, Operation Extended Turmoil 4 was launched against bases in southern Lebanon, containing an estimated 600 guerrillas. Golani forces reached the Litani river in the east, while Paratroopers reached Juwaya just south of the river. Most of the guerrilla forces did not engage the Israelis and chose to retreat, with over 40 of them killed.

In the Gaza Strip, Golani operated according to the new counter-terror IDF doctrine calling for the adoption of guerrilla tactics, and operating in small teams and in open areas. During this period, Golani units were also stationed along the Bar Lev line and participated in the War of Attrition, especially in the Qantara East area.

On the 4th of July 1976, a detachment of Golani took part in Operation Entebbe, to rescue hostages held in Uganda held by at least six Palestinians and two German terrorists supported by regular Ugandan soldiers. The mission was a resounding success, although there were three hostages killed as well as Lieutenant Colonel Yonatan Netanyahu, the commander of Sayeret Matkal who spearheaded the attack.

===Yom Kippur War===
Like the rest of the IDF, the Golani Brigade was caught by surprise with the first Arab attack of the Yom Kippur War. The brigade&#x27;s sector in the Golan Heights was lightly manned, and most of its units were either on leave or preparing for a planned major ceremony. The Syrians attacked in three major locations: near Khushniya, Quneitra and Mas&#x27;ada. The 13th Battalion&#x27;s position on Mount Hermon was overrun on October 6–7, 1973. The brigade was assigned defence of the northern Golan, in preparation for a push to retake the Hermon.
After helping fend off two major Syrian offensives, armored forces joined the battle in the area and gave Golani time to reorganize. A northern and southern force were created, with the southern force taking and defending major positions in the heart of the Golan, including Nafakh, a military base and junction on the Petroleum Road. The Petroleum Road crosses diagonally the northern Golan Heights and the Nafakh base is at the junction with a road which leads down to the strategic Bnot Yaakov Bridge over the Jordan River and into northern Israel. By October 10, those parts of the Golan under the brigade&#x27;s responsibility were back under Israeli control, and the Syrians were pushed back over the Purple Line. However, the 12th Battalion commander was killed in the battle for Mount Varda. 

The Israelis went to the offensive in the northern Golan on October 11. The 12th Battalion captured Jubata al-Khashab and Tel al-Ahmad, and later took positions and fended off Syrian attacks in Mazra&#x27;at Beit Jan. The 51st took Tel ad-Dahur, and after a failed attack on Beit Jann, took the village Hadar.

After the events of October 6, Israel was determined to recapture Mount Hermon, nicknamed the &quot;eyes of the country&quot;. The Second Battle of Mount Hermon began on October 8, when the 17th Battalion took tanks and half-tracks up the slopes of the Hermon, but its attack failed and the battalion suffered 25 dead and 57 wounded. During the next 13 days, the Israelis exchanged artillery fire with the Syrians on the Hermon. The next attack came on October 21. Operation Dessert saw a joint force of Paratroopers and Golani retake the mountain. Golani staged a three-pronged attack by the 51st Battalion, the reconnaissance unit, the 17th Battalion and a motorized battalion. The reconnaissance unit captured the cable car position at dawn with support from elements of the 17th Battalion that were seconded to the Recce Unit. The battle ended at 11:00, when the 51st Battalion reported that it had captured the Israeli Golan position.

After the Yom Kippur War, Golani forces were involved in a war of attrition with Syria until the disengagement agreement of May 31, 1974. After the agreement was signed, the brigade, which had lost many of its top officers in the war, was transferred into the Sinai to rebuild and train. They were brought back to the Golan Heights in early 1975.

===Operations in Southern Lebanon and First Lebanon War===
During the 1970s, Golani conducted frequent raids in Southern Lebanon in its battle against terror attacks and guerrilla raids by the Palestinian Fatah organization. In March 1978, with the launch of Operation Litani, much of the brigade moved to capture the village al-Hiyam. The 12th Battalion captured Marjayoun and Rashaya al-Fukhar. After clearing these villages, Golani units returned to Israel and advanced west along the Litani River, capturing a number of villages and stopping at Abbasiya just east of Tyre.

In Operation Peace for Galilee, which later became known as the First Lebanon War, Golani&#x27;s 51st Battalion fought in the vicinity of Nabatieh. On June 6, 1982, the reconnaissance unit assaulted the PLO-held Beaufort Castle. The 12th Battalion was subordinated to the Barak Armored Brigade, with a planned thrust along the Lebanese coastal strip to Tyre. This force captured the villages of Doha and Kafr Sil on June 9–10, 1982, on the outskirts of Beirut. The brigade took part in the Siege of Beirut, where its units were present until the end of the war in September 1982.

===Second Intifada===
Two years after the start of the Second Intifada in 2000, Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield in response to growing Palestinian terrorist attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians. Golani participated in a number of battles against Palestinian militants, including the siege of the Ramallah Mukataa, capture of Tulkarm, and the Battle of Jenin.

===Second Lebanon War===
In the Second Lebanon War in July 2006, Golani participated in the Battle of Maroun al-Ras and the 12th and 51st battalions fought in the Battle of Bint Jbeil. During the Battle, a hand grenade was thrown over the wall, Major Roi Klein jumped on the live grenade and muffled the explosion with his body. Eight soldiers and commanders from the 51st battalion were killed.

===2007–2022===
The Golani Brigade participated in Operation Cast Lead. On January 5, 2009, Golani soldiers Maj. Dagan Wartman (32), Staff Sgt. Nitai Stern (21), and Cpl. Yousef Muadi (19) were killed in northern Gaza in a friendly fire incident when a tank accidentally fired a live round at an abandoned building in Jabalya in which Golani forces were taking cover. Three other soldiers were severely wounded and twenty more had minor injuries.

Following the deployment of Golani soldiers in Hebron in December 2011, the Left wing press has reported that city residents have sensed a &#x27;manifest worsening of soldiers behavior&#x27;, as a result of &#x27;detention, intimidation, provocation and arrest of children and teenagers; arbitrary detention of Palestinians or blocking access to roads; beating or threatened beating of detained residents; religion-based provocation and insults; forcible entry into homes and violation of Palestinian property&#x27; and &#x27;reprisals against local and international human rights activists.&#x27;

At 1:05 a.m. on July 20, 2014, during Operation Protective Edge, seven Golani soldiers from the 13th Battalion were killed in the Battle of Shuja&#x27;iyya when an M113 armoured personnel carrier they were being transported in caught fire after an explosive device was set off under it. Reportedly, the APC was not fitted with armor that can withstand this type of blast. At 1:30 a.m., a soldier was killed when two soldiers got into a firefight with terrorists. At 5:45 a.m., another Golani force got into a firefight with terrorists. Two soldiers were killed. At 8:50 a.m., three soldiers were killed when a Golani squad was caught inside a burning building, for a total of thirteen Golani soldiers killed in action that morning. 

The commander of the Golani Brigade, Colonel Ghassan Alian, the first non-Jewish commander of the brigade and the highest ranking Druze in the IDF, was lightly injured in his eye in an exchange of fire, and later returned to his soldiers after being treated.

===2023 Israel–Hamas War===
The Golani Brigade&#x27;s 13th and 51st Battalions suffered heavy casualties during the Hamas offensive of southern Israel in October 2023. According to the Israel Defense Forces at least 72 Golani soldiers were killed and an unknown number had been captured while defending the Iron Wall. This was by far the highest number of fatalities for any single unit in the IDF during the offensive. Golani soldiers were underequipped and overstretched all along the border and were not able to repel the militants on the first line of military bases and kibbutzim that they assigned numerous platoons to defend. Each separate platoon had believed that their specific base or kibbutz was the main point of fighting and it took many hours for them to learn that Hamas had entered through everywhere at 29 points on the Gaza barrier and had reached the second and third lines of the IDF&#x27;s defenses. This prevented the Golani soldiers from being able to retreat and organize all units and fight back effectively. They had received no intelligence from anybody that Hamas was going to enter through the Iron Wall and were caught completely by surprise. Golani soldiers were completely overwhelmed at all the first line military bases, especially at Nahal Oz and Re&#x27;im. The Hamas fighters outnumbered them were able to defeat these Iron Wall bases with infantry tactics while using RPGs and Toyota pickup trucks and motorcycles for ground vehicles.

The 13th Battalion suffered 41 killed, which was more fatalities than it suffered in the Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War combined, and 91 wounded. Its headquarters were at the military base at Nahal Oz, and that was where many of the Golani soldiers were killed.

On December 12, 2023, seven Golani Brigade soldiers were killed in a booby-trapped building and subsequent ambush during the Siege of Gaza City. Most of the fatalities were high-ranking officers like Colonel Yitzhak Ben-Bashat, commander of the Golani Brigade&#x27;s forward command team, and Lieutenant Colonel Tomer Grinberg, the commander of the 13th Battalion who had fought in the battles around Nahal Oz in Israel two months earlier. Ben-Basat was the highest-ranking IDF soldier killed during the Israeli invasion of Gaza.

On 3 October 2024, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq launched a kamikaze drone attack on a military base in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, killing two soldiers and injuring 24 others of the Golani Brigade&#x27;s 13th Battalion.

==Insignia==
The symbol of the brigade is a green olive tree with its roots on a yellow background. It was drawn by the 12th Battalion&#x27;s intelligence officer, who came from kibbutz Beit Keshet, home to numerous olive trees. However, other sources claim it&#x27;s an oak located in Yavne&#x27;el.

Early Golani soldiers were farmers and new immigrants, so the strong connection to the land (earth) was important to honor. For this reason, Golani&#x27;s soldiers are designated by brown berets; the brown color symbolizing the brigade&#x27;s connection with the soil of the Land of Israel.

The Golani Brigade&#x27;s official song was written by Amos Ettinger, composed by Efi Netzer and popularly performed by Yehoram Gaon. The song mentions the brigade&#x27;s many battles, including references to Rafah in the Sinai War, Tel Faher in the Six-Day War, and Mount Hermon in the Yom Kippur War.

During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war and the IDF invasion of the Gaza strip, another flag of the Golani Brigade has also been witnessed.

==Namesakes==
At the Golani Interchange in the upper Galilee east of Haifa stands the Golani Brigade Museum commemorating the brigade and its fallen troops. The site is also used for battalion ceremonies.

<text>Huntly ( or &quot;Hunndaidh&quot;) is a town in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, formerly known as Milton of Strathbogie or simply Strathbogie. It had a population of 4,460 in 2004 and is the site of Huntly Castle. Its neighbouring settlements include Keith and Rothiemay. Both Huntly and the surrounding district of Gordon are named for a town and family that originated in the Border country.

Huntly is the historic home of the Gordon Highlanders regiment, which traditionally recruited throughout the North-East of Scotland. Huntly has a primary school (Gordon Primary) and a secondary school (The Gordon Schools) beside Huntly Castle.

Huntly is the home of the Dean&#x27;s bakers, producers of shortbread biscuits. In November 2007, the Dean&#x27;s of Huntly opened their new visitor’s centre.

Four of the owls from the local falconry centre were featured in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films.

==History==
Settlement around the confluence of the Bogie and Deveron rivers dates back to the Neolithic period. The settlement&#x27;s remains and the remains of an Iron Age hillfort have been excavated on Battlehill on the outskirts of the town. During the first millennium CE the area was dominated by the Pictish culture. A very large Pictish settlement and vitrified hillfort was situated locally at Tap o&#x27; Noth in Strathbogie.

The site was strategically important, allowing for control of the routes from Moray into Strathdon and Deeside. The first motte-and-bailey castle on this settlement was erected by Donnchadh II, Earl of Fife, the Gaelic speaking 2nd Mormaer of Fife, c.1180. The lands were transferred to the Berwickshire Anglo-Norman family, the Gordons, in 1352 in retaliation for MacDuff’s descendant, David of Strathbogie, defecting from Robert I to Edward II’s cause on the eve of the Battle of Bannockburn. 

The settlement at the confluence of the Bogie and the Deveron was known as Milton of Strathbogie or The Raws of Strathbogie until 1508.
Despite the boggy lands in the vicinity at that time, the castle at Strathbogie became a key centre for the Gordons of Moray over the following centuries. As the family built power through warfare and dynastic marriage, they became the dominant family in the North-East of Scotland, with the clan chief acquiring the informal title of Cock o&#x27; the North. As a result, a thriving settlement serving the evolving palace complex developed. The settlement became a burgh of barony in 1472. In 1508, the Gordons received a royal charter enabling them to rename Milton of Strathbogie &amp; the castle to Huntly – the name of their ancestral seat in Berwickshire.

During the Scottish Reformation, the Gordons were among the leading Catholic families in the country and heavily embroiled in Mary, Queen of Scots’ conflict with the reformed church and the protestant magnates. Huntly castle was bombarded and sacked in 1562 (by Mary) and in 1594 by James VI.

After the restoration of Gordon titles, the town continued to develop during the 17th and 18th centuries both as a market town and an adjunct to the Gordons’ palace with a wide range of merchants and artisans serving the surrounding countryside – in the mid-17th century the town hosted 4 separate glovers. 

The adjacent parishes of Dunbennan and Kinnoir were consolidated into a single parish of Huntly in 1727, though each of these livings had been in the gift of the Marquess of Huntly for centuries. During this century, the Duke of Gordon also commenced redeveloping the town as a planned-town with grid-iron streets.

The 18th centuries saw the development of the flax industry and associated cottage industries in heckling, spinning, bleaching and weaving, though the trade was inhibited in the longer term by poor transport infrastructure to Banff and Aberdeen. Smuggling whisky was also an important trade at this period until the industry was licensed in 1823.

In the 19th century, following the post-Napoleonic slump in the linen trade, the town experienced another period of growth with the establishment of rail transport in 1845 coupled with a shift from peasant farming to capitalist agriculture. Huntly became an important market and shipping centre whilst its surrounding parishes depopulated.

In 1836 the town and the Gordon estates passed to the Sussex-based 5th Duke of Richmond by inheritance. Ownership of the feu and much of the land and property remained in the ownership of the Dukes of Richmond and Gordon until August 1936 when all the property and feus in the town along with much surrounding farmland was sold at auction at Huntly Town Hall in order to pay death duties on the ducal estates.

Though the town’s population has varied slightly over the 20th century – with a net outward migration after the 2nd World War – the town in 2018 had a population of 4,650. This compares with 4,229 in 1911. Significant demographic growth was over the course of the 19th century from 1000 in 1800 to 3,600 in 1861.

==Arts==
Huntly is home to Deveron Projects, an arts organisation that invites artists from all over the world to come and live and work in the town. Since 1995 it has worked with a &#x27;town is the venue&#x27; methodology, connecting artists, communities and places. It hosts artists and projects that explore local, regional and global topics, such as forestry, geology, botany, foraging, anthropology, history, politics and art. Over 100 renowned artists have spent time in the town, including Roman Signer and Hamish Fulton.

Walking is often used as a medium to bring people together for these projects, and Deveron Projects has a Walking Institute that commissions artists to make walks. Their annual Slow Marathon started in 2012 in collaboration with Ethiopian artist Mihret Kebede. Deveron Projects also runs a community kitchen and gardening projects. In 2013 Deveron Projects won Huntly the Creative Place Award, which recognises &#x27;creativity across Scotland’s smaller communities&#x27;.

He frequently returned to Huntly across his life in China, bringing three young Chinese lads to live there and get &quot;a good Scottish education&quot; in 1845. By the time they returned to China in 1848 they had all been invited to meet Queen Victoria, then a lively young woman. Legge retired from his mission work in Hong Kong in 1873, was named the first Oxford Professor of Chinese in 1876, and lived there until his death. His father Ebenezer Legge had been Mayor of Huntly, and the Legge family home is still in use, on the main square.

<text>&#x27;Iraq Suwaydan (, ) was a Palestinian Arab village located northeast of Gaza City. It was captured by Israeli forces in Operation Yoav against the defending Egyptian Army during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The village infrastructure, with the exception of the police station built by the British Mandate authorities, was destroyed.

==History==
Archaeological excavations have found remains from the early Roman, Byzantine and Umayyad periods.

===Ottoman Empire===
Iraq Suwaydan, like all of Palestine was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517. In the 1596 tax registers, Iraq Suwaydan was listed as an entirely Muslim village called &quot;Iraq&quot;, located in the &quot;nahiya&quot; of Gazza, part of Gaza Sanjak, with a population of 45 families and 16 bachelors. The inhabitants paid a fixed tax rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards, fruit trees, sesame, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 5,000 akçe. 1/4 of the revenue went to a Waqf.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the area of &#x27;Iraq Suwaydan experienced a significant process of settlement decline due to nomadic pressures on local communities. The residents of abandoned villages moved to surviving settlements, but the land continued to be cultivated by neighboring villages.

In 1838 Edward Robinson noted it on his travels in the area,
as a Muslim village in the Gaza district.

Socin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that &quot;Arak es-Sudan&quot; counted 29 houses and a population of 112, though the population count included men only.
Hartmann found that the village had 94 houses.

In 1883, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described it as a moderate-sized village situated on a plain.

===British Mandate===

In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;&#x27;Eraq el-Suaiden&quot; had a population of 349 Muslims,
increasing in the 1931 census to 440, still all Muslims, in 81 houses.

In 1942, the villagers established an elementary school and in 1947 shared its facilities with the children of the neighboring villages, Ibdis and Bayt &#x27;Affa. There were 104 students in the mid-1940s. The main crop was grain, with some almond trees and grapes.

In the 1945 statistics &quot;&#x27;Iraq Suweidan&quot; had a population of 660, all Muslims, with a total of 7,529 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 9 dunams were used for plantations and irrigable land, 7,329 for cereals,
while 35 dunams were built-up land.

===Israel===
On 12 May 1948, the British authorities withdrew, handing over the police fort to the Egyptian army, which then garrisoned it.
The fort controlled the road between al-Majdal and Bayt Jibrin as well as the main road to the Negev. The village was captured and destroyed during Operation Yoav. Eight Israeli attempts to capture the fort failed. It finally fell on 9 November 1948 after a massive bombardment including air strikes by B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft.

Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. In 1953 the moshav of Yad Natan was founded east of Iraq Suwaydan on village lands. In 1955 another moshav named Otzem was established on village lands to the southeast and in 1956, kibbutz Sde Yoav was established west of the site, close to village land.

In 1992, remains of houses could be seen in a eucalyptus grove that the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi identified as the center of the village, along with cacti and remnants of a pool. Two roads, one passing through the village and the other leading to fields, were recognizable. The British police station, renamed Metzudat Yo&#x27;av, was still in use and the surrounding lands were cultivated by Israeli farmers.

<doc id="336417" wikidata="Q586735" url="?curid=336417" title="San Francisco Art Institute">
<text>San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI) was a private college of contemporary art in San Francisco, California. Founded in 1871, SFAI was one of the oldest art schools in the United States and the oldest west of the Mississippi River. Approximately 220 undergraduates and 112 graduate students were enrolled in 2021. The institution was accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD), and was a member of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD). The school closed permanently in July 2022.

==History==

=== 19th century ===

The San Francisco Art Institute roots go back to 1871 with the formation of the San Francisco Art Association—a small but influential group of artists, writers, and community leaders, most notably, led by Virgil Macey Williams and first president Juan B. Wandesforde, with B.P. Avery, Edward Bosqui, Thomas Hill, and S.W. Shaw, who came together to promote regional art and artists, and to establish a school and museum to further and preserve what they saw as a new and distinct artistic tradition which had developed in the relative cultural isolation and unique landscape of the American West.

By 1874, the SFAA had 700 regular members and 100 life members and had raised sufficient funds and the necessary momentum to launch an art school, which was named the California School of Design (CSD). Painter Virgil Macy Williams, who had spent nearly ten years studying with master painters in Italy and had taught at Harvard College before coming to San Francisco, became the school&#x27;s first director and painting instructor—positions he held until his sudden death in 1886. During Williams&#x27; tenure, the CSD developed a national reputation and amassed a significant collection of early California and western fine art as the foundation collected for a planned museum.

In 1893, Edward Searles donated the Hopkins Mansion, one of the most palatial and elaborate Victorian mansions ever built, to the University of California in trust for the SFAA for &quot;instruction in and illustration of the fine arts, music and literature.&quot; Named the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art, it housed both the CSD&#x27;s campus and SFAA&#x27;s art collection. Through this new affiliation, students of the University of California were able to enroll in classes at the CSD.

=== 20th century ===
In 1906, the devastating fire following the San Francisco earthquake destroyed the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art building, and the CSD and SFAA facilities, records and art collection. At the time, the replacement value of the building and its contents was estimated at $2.573 million. However, the combined amount of numerous insurance policies yielded less than $100,000 for rebuilding. Nevertheless, within a year, the SFAA built a new but comparatively modest campus in the same location,&lt;ref name=&quot;CSL/California-Art-Institute-1908&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted the name San Francisco Institute of Art.

In 1916, the SFAA merged with the San Francisco Society of Artists and assumed directorship of the San Francisco Museum of Art at the Palace of Fine Arts, which was established to host the 1915 World&#x27;s Fair, Panama–Pacific International Exposition. In addition, the school was renamed the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA) to better reflect its mission to promote, develop and preserve regional art and culture. In 1926 the school moved to 800 Chestnut Street, which remained the school&#x27;s main campus. In 1930 Mexican muralist Diego Rivera was hired to paint &quot;The Making of a Fresco Showing the Building of a City&quot;, which is located in the student-directed art gallery.

During its first 60 years, influential artists associated with the school included Eadweard Muybridge, photographer and pioneer of motion graphics; Maynard Dixon, painter of San Francisco&#x27;s labor movement and of the landscape of the West; Henry Kiyama, whose &quot;Four Immigrants Manga&quot; was the first graphic novel published in the U.S.; Sargent Claude Johnson, one of the first African-American artists from California to achieve a national reputation; Louise Dahl-Wolfe, an innovative photographer whose work for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; in the 1930s defined a new American style of &quot;environmental&quot; fashion photography; Gutzon Borglum, the creator of the large-scale public sculpture known as Mount Rushmore; Rudolf Hess, German Expressionist painter and art critic, Emily Carr, Modernist Canadian painter well known for her work with indigenous culture, and numerous others.

After World War II ended (1945) the school became a nucleus for Abstract Expressionism, with faculty including Clyfford Still, Ad Reinhardt, Mark Rothko, David Park, Elmer Bischoff, and Clay Spohn. Although painting and sculpture remained the dominant mediums for many years, photography had also been among the course offerings. In 1946 Ansel Adams and Minor White established the first fine-art photography department, with Imogen Cunningham, Edward Weston, and Dorothea Lange among its instructors. In 1947 distinguished filmmaker Sydney Peterson began the first film courses at CSFA. In this spirit of advancement, in 1949 CSFA Director Douglas MacAgy organized an international conference, The Western Roundtable on Modern Art, which included Marcel Duchamp, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Gregory Bateson. The roundtable aimed to expose “hidden assumptions” and to frame new questions about art.

By the early 1950s, San Francisco&#x27;s North Beach had become the West Coast center of the Beat Movement, and music, poetry, and discourse were an intrinsic part of artists&#x27; lives. Collage artist Jess Collins renounced a career as a plutonium developer and enrolled at SFAI as a painting student. In 1953 he and his partner, poet Robert Duncan, along with painter Harry Jacobus, started the King Ubu Gallery, an important alternative space for art, poetry, and music.

A distinctly Californian modern art soon emerged that fused abstraction, figuration, narrative, and jazz. SFAI faculty David Park, Elmer Bischoff, James Weeks, James Kelly, Frank Lobdell, and Richard Diebenkorn were now the leaders of the Bay Area Figurative Movement, informed by their experience of seeing local museum exhibitions of work by Edvard Munch, Max Beckmann, Edgar Degas, and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. Students at the school, including David Simpson, John Hultberg, William T. Wiley, Robert Hudson, William Allan, Joan Brown, Manuel Neri, Carlos Villa, and Wally Hedrick, continued the investigation of new ideas and new materials, many becoming the core of the Funk art movement.

Renamed San Francisco Art Institute in 1961, SFAI rejected the distinction between fine and applied arts. SFAI stood at the forefront of recognizing an expanded vocabulary of art-making that hybridized many practices including performance, conceptual art, new media, graphic arts, typography, and political and social documentary.
Students in the early to mid-1960s included artists Ronald Davis, Robert Graham, Forrest Myers, Leo Valledor, Michael Heizer, Ronnie Landfield, Peter Reginato, Gary Stephan, and John Duff and in the late 1960s Annie Leibovitz, who would soon begin photographing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine; Paul McCarthy, well known for his performance and sculpture works; and Charles Bigelow, who would be among the first typographers to design fonts for computers. Alumni Ruth-Marion Baruch and Pirkle Jones documented the early days of the Black Panther Party in northern California.

In 1969, a new addition to the building by Paffard Keatinge-Clay added of studio space, a large theater/lecture hall, an outdoor amphitheater, galleries, and a cafe.

Installation art, video, music, and social activism continued to inform much of the work of faculty and students in the 1970s and 1980s. The faculty during this period included George Kuchar, Gunvor Nelson, Howard Fried, Paul Kos, Angela Davis, Kathy Acker, Robert Colescott, and many other influential artists and writers. Among the students were a number of performance artists and musicians, including Karen Finley, whose performances challenged notions of femininity and political power, and Prairie Prince and Michael Cotten, who presented their first performance as the Tubes in the SFAI lecture hall, and became pioneers in the field of music video. The school became a hub for the Punk music scene, with bands such as the Mutants, the Avengers, and Romeo Void all started by SFAI students. Technology also became part of art practice: faculty Sharon Grace&#x27;s Send/Receive project used satellite communications to create an interactive transcontinental performance, while Survival Research Laboratories, founded by student Mark Pauline, began staging large-scale outdoor performances of ritualized interactions among machines, robots, and pyrotechnics.

Since the 1990s the studio and classroom have become increasingly connected to the world via public art and community actions. As students at SFAI, Barry McGee, Aaron Noble, and Rigo 23, among others, were part of the movement known as the Mission School, taking their graffiti-inspired art to the streets and walls of the city. Faculty and students have created site-specific projects in locations from the San Francisco waterfront (Ann Chamberlain and Walter Hood&#x27;s monument to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade) to the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana, Mexico (a sculpture by artist Pedro Reyes and SFAI students for the U.S. Department of State&#x27;s Art in Embassies program). Organizations like Artists&#x27; Television Access (ATA) and Root Division, founded by alumni, and SFAI&#x27;s City Studio program engage and educate local communities and cultivate a vital artistic ecosystem.

The school&#x27;s history was recognized in 2016, when its campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Closure ==

Due to financial mismanagement, declining enrollment, high real estate costs, and a reliance on income from campus property rentals, which was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the school announced on March 23, 2020, that it would stop accepting new students for the following fall semester. The institute marked its 149th birthday on Thursday, March 26, 2020, shortly after failed merger talks. 

They briefly announced the cancellation of the fall 2020 semester before reversing their decision and allowing for online and offline classes through the 2020–21 school year. In July 2020, after securing $4 million in donations, the board and administration announced an agreement had been reached to retain all tenured faculty for the coming academic year, resulting in the continuation of courses for the following academic year and the reinstatement of the degree program for those within a year of graduation.

In February 2022 the University of San Francisco and SFAI announced that they were studying an acquisition of SFAI by USF; however USF backed out of the deal in July. SFAI ceased its degree programs but announced it would remain as &quot;a nonprofit organization to protect its name, archives, and legacy&quot;. On July 16, 2022, the school closed permanently.

On April 26, 2023, the San Francisco Art Institute filed for Chapter 7 liquidation. The campus was put up for sale in late June, with an announcement that Diego Rivera&#x27;s mural in the Diego Rivera Gallery, &quot;The Making of a Fresco, Showing the Building of a City&quot;, with an assessed value of $50 million, would be sold as part of the property unless no satisfactory offer is received, in which case it might be available for separate sale.

In late February 2024, a nonprofit corporation endowed by Laurene Powell Jobs bought the campus including the mural for approximately $30 million, with the stated intention of continuing its use as an arts institution, plus possible on-campus housing for artists in residence.

==Academics==
SFAI offered Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Master of Arts (MA), and Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degrees. SFAI also offered Low-Residency MFAs and Post-Baccalaureate certificates in Studio Art.

===Photography===
Founded by Ansel Adams in 1945, the Photography Department became the first program of its kind dedicated to exploring photography as a fine-art medium. Adams designed the school&#x27;s darkrooms and attracted photographers for the original faculty, including Dorothea Lange, Imogen Cunningham, Minor White, and Morley Baer, who became Head of the Department after White&#x27;s departure in 1953.

===Painting===
Throughout the SFAI Painting Department&#x27;s history, it had been home to celebrated artists such as Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Hassel Smith, Richard Diebenkorn, Jay DeFeo, Fred Martin, Bruce McGaw, Elmer Bischoff, David Park, David Simpson, Frank Lobdell, Roy De Forest, Joan Brown, Ronald Davis, William T. Wiley, Toba Khedoori, Barry McGee, Inez Storer and Kehinde Wiley among others and was central to movements such as Abstract Expressionism, Bay Area Figuration, Color Field, California Funk, and the Mission School.

===New Genres===
Howard Fried founded the performance and video department (which later became New Genres) at the San Francisco Art Institute. In the late 1970s, a long-lost collection of Eadweard Muybridge photographs was found and an auction of the materials financed the creation of the department — and the purchase of two Portopak cameras. (More than a century before, the English artist had presented the first ever public showing of moving pictures on campus and apparently left something behind.)

===Music===
Among the many artist musicians who studied at SFAI are Jerry Garcia, guitarist in Grateful Dead; Dave Getz, drummer for Big Brother and the Holding Company and Country Joe and the Fish; Prairie Prince of The Tubes; Debora Iyall of Romeo Void; Freddy (aka Fritz) of the Mutants; Penelope Houston of the Avengers, Courtney Love, actress and rock musician;
Jonathan Holland of Tussle; Devendra Banhart.

==Housing==
In summer 2010, SFAI moved its housing program to two locations in Nob Hill: Sutter Hall at 717 Sutter Street, and Abby Hall at 630 Geary Street. In spring 2020, the housing program was dissolved due to financial exigency.

==Exhibitions and public programs==
Students were given direct access to exhibitions, lectures, symposia, films, and other unique interdisciplinary events. An integral part of campus life, such events connected students to the larger community of artists, art, and contemporary ideas. The Walter and McBean Galleries (on the 800 Chestnut Street campus) house exhibitions, workshops, and other alternative and experimental avenues for presenting work by international contemporary artists. Students also had the opportunity to display their work in a number of spots on SFAI&#x27;s two campuses, including the Diego Rivera Gallery.

===Adaline Kent Award===
Former board member (1947–1957), Adaline Kent was a sculptor and alumni of the school. Upon her death in 1957, she bequeathed $10,000 for the establishment of an annual award for a promising California Artist. Each year since 1957 the prize was awarded by the San Francisco Art Institute Artists&#x27; Committee. Winners included Ron Nagle (1978), Wally Hedrick (1985), Mildred Howard (1991), Clare Rojas (2004), and as the final award, Scott Williams (2005).

<text>Albert Edwin Condon (November 16, 1905 – August 4, 1973) was an American jazz banjoist, guitarist, and bandleader. A leading figure in Chicago jazz, he also played piano and sang. He also owned a self-named night club in New York City.

==Early years==
Condon was born in Goodland, Indiana, the son of John and Margaret (née McGraw) Condon. He grew up in Momence, Illinois, and Chicago Heights, Illinois, where he attended St. Agnes and Bloom High School. After playing ukulele, he switched to banjo and was a professional musician by 1921.

When he was 15 years old, he received his first union card in Waterloo, Iowa.

== Career ==
He was based in Chicago for most of the 1920s, and played with such jazz notables as Bix Beiderbecke, Jack Teagarden, and Frank Teschemacher. He and Red McKenzie formed the Chicago Rhythm Kings in 1925. While in Chicago, Condon and other white musicians would go to Lincoln Gardens to watch and learn from King Oliver and his band. They later would frequent the Sunset Café to see Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five for the same reasons.

In 1928, Condon moved to New York City. He frequently arranged jazz sessions for the record companies, sometimes playing with the artists he brought to the recording studios, including Louis Armstrong and Fats Waller. He organised racially integrated recording sessions—when these were still rare—with Fats Waller, Armstrong and Henry &#x27;Red&#x27; Allen. He played with the band of Red Nichols for a time. Later, from 1938 he had a long association with Milt Gabler&#x27;s Commodore Records.

A handful of records were issued under his own name in the late &#x27;20s and early &#x27;30s: a July 28, 1928 two-song session was recorded for OKeh, but only issued in England. On October 30, 1928, an OKeh was issued as &quot;Eddie Condon and his Footwarmers&quot;, featuring Jack Teagarden. A further session on February 8, 1929, yielded a record issued under the name &quot;Eddie Hot Shots&quot; and issued on Victor&#x27;s hot dance series. In 1932 he recorded multiple sessions with the Rhythmakers in New York City. In 1933, a further two sessions were recorded for Brunswick consisting of 6 recordings, only 2 of which were released in the US. From 1938 on, Condon recorded for Commodore and one session for Decca.

From the late 1930s on he was a regular at the Manhattan jazz club Nick&#x27;s. The sophisticated variation on Dixieland music which Condon and his colleagues created there came to be nicknamed &quot;Nicksieland&quot;. Condon hated having his music called &quot;Dixieland.&quot; He never used the term himself and emphasized his view by calling his first autobiography &quot;We Called it Music&quot;. By this time, his regular circle of musical associates included Wild Bill Davison, Bobby Hackett, George Brunies, Edmond Hall, and Pee Wee Russell. In 1939, he appeared with &quot;Bobby Hacket and Band&quot; in the Warner Brothers &amp; Vitaphone film musical short-subject, &quot;On the Air.&quot;

Condon did a series of jazz radio broadcasts, &quot;Eddie Condon&#x27;s Jazz Concerts&quot;, from New York&#x27;s Town Hall during 1944–45 which were nationally broadcast. These recordings survive, and have been issued on the Jazzology label.

From 1945 through 1967, he ran his own New York jazz club, Eddie Condon&#x27;s, first located on West 3rd Street in Greenwich Village, then 52nd Street near Sixth Avenue, on the present site of the CBS headquarters building; then later, on the south side of East 56th Street, east of Second Avenue. In the 1950s, Condon recorded a sequence of classic albums for Columbia Records. The musicians involved in these albums, and at Condon&#x27;s club, included Wild Bill Davison, Bobby Hackett (cornet), Billy Butterfield (trumpet), Edmond Hall, Peanuts Hucko, Pee Wee Russell, Bob Wilber (clarinet), Cutty Cutshall, Lou McGarity, George Brunies (trombone), Bud Freeman (tenor sax), Gene Schroeder, Dick Cary, Ralph Sutton (piano), Bob Casey, Walter Page, Jack Lesberg, Al Hall (bass), George Wettling, Buzzy Drootin, Cliff Leeman (drums).

Condon toured Britain in 1957 with a band including Wild Bill Davison, Cutty Cutshall, Gene Schroeder and George Wettling. His last tour was in 1964, when he took a band to Australia and Japan. Condon&#x27;s men, on that tour, were Buck Clayton (trumpet), Pee Wee Russell (clarinet), Vic Dickenson (trombone), Bud Freeman (tenor sax), Dick Cary (piano and alto horn), Jack Lesberg (bass), Cliff Leeman (drums), Jimmy Rushing (vocals). Billy Banks, a vocalist who had recorded with Condon and Pee Wee Russell in 1932, and had lived in obscurity in Japan for many years, turned up at one of the 1964 concerts: Pee Wee asked him &quot;have you got any more gigs?&quot;.

In 1948, Condon&#x27;s autobiography &quot;We Called It Music&quot; was published. &quot;Eddie Condon&#x27;s Treasury of Jazz&quot; (1956) was a collection of articles co-edited by Condon and Richard Gehman.

A latter-day collaborator, clarinetist Kenny Davern, described a Condon gig: &quot;It was always a thrill to get a call from Eddie and with a gig involved even more so. I remember eating beforehand with Bernie (Previn, trumpet) and Lou (McGarity, trombone) and everyone being in good spirits. There was a buzz on, we&#x27;d all had a taste and there was a great feel to the music.&quot;

Condon toured and appeared at jazz festivals until 1971. His last public appearance was at the New School for Social Research in New York in April 1973 where he played with several of his regulars. The concert was recorded (Chiaroscuro Records CRD110).

During most of his career Condon played and recorded using a four-string guitar. However he never made a solo with this instrument, at least not on record.

==Personal life==
Condon married fashion copywriter Phyllis Smith (1903-1986) in 1942. They had two daughters, Maggie and Liza.

==Death==
On August 4, 1973, Condon died of a bone disease at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, New York. He was 67. His funeral was held at Frank E. Campbell Chapel in Manhattan. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.

<doc id="336423" wikidata="Q680483" url="?curid=336423" title="List of British Columbia provincial highways">
<text>The Canadian province of British Columbia has a system of numbered highways that travel between various cities and regions with onward connections to neighboring provinces and U.S. states. The numbering scheme, announced in March 1940, includes route numbers that reflect United States Numbered Highways that continue south of the Canada–United States border. Highway 1 is numbered in accordance with other routes on the Trans-Canada Highway system.

==Major routes==
===East–west===
* The Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) runs from Victoria to Nanaimo on Vancouver Island. Then, after a ferry ride to the mainland, it continues from Horseshoe Bay, through the Vancouver area, Abbotsford, Hope, Kamloops, Salmon Arm, and Revelstoke to Kicking Horse Pass on the BC/Alberta border. This is the major east–west route in the province.
* The Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3) runs from Hope, then through Osoyoos, Castlegar, Cranbrook, right to Crowsnest Pass on the BC/Alberta border. This is a southern alternate route to the Trans-Canada, and runs very close to the Canada–US border.
* The Yellowhead/Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 16) starts on Haida Gwaii. After a ferry ride to the mainland, it runs from Prince Rupert through Smithers and Prince George, and then meets the Alberta border at Yellowhead Pass.
* The Lougheed Highway (Highway 7) is a major alternate route that runs from Vancouver to Hope, north of the Fraser River.
* The Okanagan Connector (Highway 97C) is a short but major route that connects the Okanagan Valley to the Coquihalla Highway (Highway 5) at Merritt. 97C branches off Highway 97 at Peachland, about midway between Penticton and Kelowna.

===North–south===
* The Island Highway (Highway 19) is an extension of Highway 1 on Vancouver Island. It runs from Nanaimo and provides access to all points northbound on Vancouver Island, including Parksville, Courtenay, Comox, Campbell River, and Port Hardy.
* The Patricia Bay Highway (Highway 17) starts in Victoria and heads northward through Saanich to the Swartz Bay ferry terminal. Recently, there was a gap between the segments of Highway 17 (now filled in with the SFPR), as the Mainland portion was designated as Highway 17A. The new South Fraser Perimeter Road has been named as Highway 17, and presently is open in Delta and Surrey between Highway 17a and Highway 15.
* Highway 99 starts as an extension of Interstate 5 at the Canada–US border in Surrey as a freeway until entering the city of Vancouver. There it becomes a series of various heavily signalized major city core thoroughfares, notably Granville Street and Georgia Street. After crossing the Lions Gate Bridge, the highway - now known as the Sea-to-Sky Highway, is a two-to-four lane route that accesses Squamish and Whistler, before veering east and meeting with Highway 97 north of Cache Creek.
* The Coquihalla/Southern Yellowhead Highway (Highway 5) is a freeway that bypasses the slower Fraser Canyon portion of the Trans Canada Highway, connecting the cities of Hope, Merritt, and Kamloops. The segment between Hope and Merritt was a toll highway until 2008. North of Kamloops, the route is known as the Southern Yellowhead Highway, and meets up with the main route of the Yellowhead Highway near the Alberta border.
* Highway 97 is the longest highway in the province. The highway starts at the Canada–US border near Osoyoos. The highway, here known as the &quot;Okanagan Highway&quot;, passes through the major Okanagan Valley cities of Penticton, West Kelowna, Kelowna, and Vernon, before ending in Kamloops. From Kamloops, it is known as the &quot;Cariboo Highway&quot;, and passes through Cache Creek, Williams Lake, Quesnel, and ends in Prince George. North from there, it is known as the &quot;John Hart Highway&quot;, and ends in Dawson Creek. From there, the highway then is known as the famed &quot;Alaska Highway&quot;, and travels northwest through the province until it reaches the Yukon border.

==Route list==
List is current as of May 2017, according to the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation. All routes are signed with the standard &quot;BC Primary Highway Marker&quot; shield, except where stated as &quot;Unsigned&quot;, signed under a street name, signed with the Trans-Canada, Yellowhead, Crowsnest, or Nisga&#x27;a route marker, or cosigned with any combination of the above, in the &quot;Notes&quot; column.
==Unnumbered highways==
The following routes are maintained by the Ministry of Transportation as part of British Columbia&#x27;s highway system, but they are Currently unnumbered.

===Unofficial numbers===
Provincially maintained roads with informal or unofficial numbers:



===Pseudo routes===
Provincially maintained routes which are unnumbered. Route numbers are unsigned and internally referred to as &quot;pseudo-numbers&quot;. Pseudo-numbers start with a 9, followed by a two-digit number designating a &quot;transportation district&quot;, a colon, and then a four-digit number derived from the province&#x27;s Landmark Kilometre Inventory system.


























==Yukon highways in British Columbia==
The following routes are within British Columbia but are considered part of the Yukon highway system. Although the Alaska Highway crosses the 60th parallel north, and thus the border with the Yukon, nine times (including six crossings between historic miles 588 and 596), the highway route number changes just once, between Lower Post, British Columbia, and Watson Lake, Yukon. The Yukon section east of here is maintained by Public Works Canada as part of the B.C. portion of Highway 97, while the B.C. section west of here is maintained by the Yukon Government as part of Yukon Highway 1.



==Defunct route numbers==
The first two freeways built in British Columbia were given 400-series numbers, much like the 400-Series Highways in Ontario. Highways 401 and 499 were renumbered 1 and 99 respectively in 1973. The section of Highway 37 between Terrace and Kitimat was known as Highway 25 until 1986. In recent years, many routes have been devolved to regional and/or municipal authorities and have lost their official highway status, notably the Fraser Highway in the Lower Mainland (formerly part of Highway 1A) and West Saanich Road on Vancouver Island (formerly Highway 17A). Also King George Highway through Surrey was renamed by the City in 2010 to King George Boulevard. (formerly British Columbia Highway 99A).

==Defunct lettering system==
Prior to 1940, British Columbia classified its major roads with letters.
Ultimately, in 1939 or early 1940, a decision was made by the Department of Public Works (now the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure) to replace the lettering system with the familiar number system. This transition took place during the 1940/1941 fiscal year and led to the installation of route markers along multiple highways.

<doc id="336425" wikidata="Q837242" url="?curid=336425" title="Signature Records">
<text>Signature Records was a jazz record company and label founded in 1939 by Bob Thiele when he was 17 years old. Its roster included Coleman Hawkins, Earl Hines, Erroll Garner, and Lester Young.

At age 14, Thiele was a disc jockey for his own jazz radio show, edited his own jazz magazine, and played clarinet with bands in New York City. He started Signature at age 17. Thiele was head producer and president of the label. Its musical director was orchestra leader Ray Bloch.

Some sources recite that Signature closed in 1948. However, other sources indicate that the label continued to release records into the 50s, but that by the late 50s it was moribund.
Having freelanced and produced for Decca Records and its Coral and Brunswick labels, and served as vice president for A&amp;R for Dot Records, Thiele announced in May 1959 that he was reactivating the Signature label. The venture appears to have been in partnership with Steve Allen, one of the co-owners of Hanover Records, who brought the label into the arrangement. The new company was known as Hanover-Signature Records. Orchestra leader Milton Delugg, who had worked with Thiele at Dot and Coral, was named musical director.

The company continued to release records on both labels. Thiele produced records for his then-wife, singer Teresa Brewer, as late as 1983. Hanover releases continued into 1961. Thiele reissued Signature recordings on his later Flying Dutchman and Doctor Jazz record labels.

<text>Sarah &#x27;Sallie&#x27; Lockwood Winchester (née Pardee; June 4, 1839 – September 5, 1922) was an American heiress who amassed great wealth after the death of her husband, William Wirt Winchester, and her mother in law, Jane Ellen Hope.

Winchester has become known for the construction of Llanada Villa which was built to trap sprits and ghosts that she thought were following her. Six months after her death, the home was turned into a tourist attraction now known as the Winchester Mystery House. Testimonies and records from those who knew her describe her as intelligent, kind, a savvy financial manager, and not superstitious, remaining sharp-witted even into old age. However, in the years since her death, she has been depicted in popular culture as guilt-ridden, mad with grief, and delirious in her later life.

==Early life==
Sarah Lockwood Pardee was the fifth child and fourth daughter born to parents Leonard and Sarah Pardee (née Burns) in the summer of 1839 at 29 Orange Street in New Haven, Connecticut. Though she was formally called Sarah, she was named after her paternal grandmother, Sally Pardee Goodyear and was called Sallie all her life and signed all her correspondence using this name. She had four sisters and one brother who survived to adulthood. One sister, her namesake Sarah E. Pardee, and Leonard and Sarah&#x27;s firstborn died from cholera when she was a year old. The name Lockwood was after Pardee&#x27;s father&#x27;s longtime friend Lockwood Sanford who was a well-known New England wood engraver.

Winchester&#x27;s father was a skilled craftsman who had established a mill and wood shop called Leonard Pardee &amp; Company.

Growing up, Pardee was educated, had a private French tutor, and took music lessons. Her family had progressive ideas for the time regarding religion and philanthropic choices, publicly expressing their opinions on such things as abolition, suffrage and animal rights. As an adult Sallie supported her sister Belle Merriman&#x27;s animal rights activism, and is known to have chastised a boy who sought permission to hunt robins on her property.

Pardee lived with her family on Brown Street from 1853, when she was 14, until 1862 when she was married.

According to Mary Jo Ignoffo in her book &quot;Captive of the Labyrinth,&quot; Winchester was an independent thinker who was not as social as her siblings as a teenager.

==Marriage and family deaths==

During the American Civil War, Pardee, who was under five feet tall and then twenty-three, married William Wirt Winchester, then twenty-five, on Tuesday, September 30, 1862. William was the son of a wealthy shirt manufacturer who would later become known for being the founder of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. The two had been childhood friends and neighbors.

Because of building material shortages due to the Civil War, the two lived with William&#x27;s parents on Court Street, New Haven. They hoped to build their own home on Prospect Hill. After the war, in 1866, the new home began construction.

On June 15, 1866, Sallie gave birth to a baby girl they named Annie Pardee Winchester, in honor of William&#x27;s late sister, who had died during childbirth. The child suffered from marasmus and died within a month of her birth. The couple was devastated and withdrew from society, with Sallie remaining secluded for nearly a year.

During the construction of their home on Prospect Hill, the Winchesters embraced learning about architecture and design. Architecture and design became life-long hobbies for Sallie, who also learned about real estate investment and financial strategies from William and her father-in-law.

The house was completed in 1868, was approximately 20,000 square feet, had over twenty rooms with marble floors, decorative fireplaces and chandeliers, large bay windows, plasterwork ceilings, and a circular drive in front.

In June 1869, Sallie’s father died, at the age of sixty, possibly from rheumatoid arthritis.

Between 1880 and 1881, Sallie lost three close family members. Her mother died in May 1880, her father-in-law, Oliver Winchester, died in December that same year, and her husband died from tuberculosis in March 1881.

After the loss of so many family members, Sallie spent time at the seashore, followed by a trip to Europe.

==Inheritance==
Shortly before his death, William made out bank drafts to his wife, totalling $7,500 and made her the executrix of his will. Sallie was forty years old when her husband died. She henceforth controlled 777 Winchester Repeating Arms Company shares which were valued at $77,700 at the time. Between 1880 and 1885, she earned dividends from the stock, which averaged $7,900 annually. With the death of her mother-in-law, Jane Winchester, in 1898, Sallie inherited a further 2,000 shares of Winchester Repeating Arms Company stock that was then worth about $400 per share.

==California==
After the loss of so many family members and after a physician recommended the dryer and warmer climate for her worsening rheumatoid arthritis, Winchester decided to move to California, which was touted, at the time, as a place with a good climate, soil, and relatively cheap land for sale. She had previously been to San Francisco with her husband and had enjoyed her visit.

In 1884, Mary Converse, her eldest sister, died of cancer, convincing Winchester&#x27;s sisters that they too should move to California. Winchester paid for her sister Isabelle &quot;Belle&quot; Merriman and Estelle Gerard and their children&#x27;s move. Another sister, Nettie Sprague also moved to California as her husband, Homer Sprague, became president of a college for young women in the San Francisco area. Winchester supported her relatives financially for the rest of their lives.

Along with her sisters, her reins-man who drove her carriages, Frank Carroll accompanied Winchester to California. Once in California, Winchester found Euthanasia Meade who became her personal physician, until Meade died in 1895.

Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Rambo, the San Francisco agent for the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, showed Winchester properties in the Santa Clara Valley.

===Llanada Villa===

The house that would eventually be named the Winchester Mystery House was purchased for $12,570 from John Hamm by Winchester in 1886 and was situated on a forty-five acre ranch in the Santa Clara Valley. She named the eight room farmhouse and property Llanada Villa, since the area reminded her of the Llanada Alavasa in Spain, a place that she and her husband had visited ten years earlier. At this property, Winchester was one of the first to grow fruit in the area. The first person Winchester hired was Rambo to become foreman of the farm, though he did also continue his duties at the Winchester office in San Francisco. In addition, she supplied housing on the property for Carroll&#x27;s family. She hired local people to staff the house and farm, many of whom were from Europe, China and, later, Japan.

The house was located on a country lane named Santa Clara-Los Gatos Road. After Winchester died the road was renamed first Winchester Road then Winchester Boulevard. Her initial plan was to build a house to accommodate her whole family. This never happened partly due to the isolated location and partly due to the constant construction. The only family member to live with her was her niece Maria &quot;Daisy&quot; Merriman who moved in when she was twenty-one in 1890.

Within the first six months, Ignoffo estimates that the house had increased in size to twenty-six rooms. She attended Expositions that inspired her interior and exterior design. As was typical of the time, the design included much ornamentation, including a statue of Hebe, which still stands at the home, intricately laid, patterned wood floors of a variety of hardwoods including teak and mahogany, embossed wall coverings that looked like leather or metal, ceilings decorated with stencils and moldings, German chandeliers, Austrian art glass, Asian furnishings and French paintings.

The gardens were filled with ornamental trees, shrubs and flowers. It is estimated that Winchester had plants from over 110 countries in the villa gardens.

Winchester hired at least two architects, but they would not have been to the calibre she was used to from New Haven. Ignoffo speculates that this could be why she chose to run the construction project herself, seeking the advice of carpenters she hired. Her interest in architecture was evident by her subscription to journals including &quot; Architectural Record.&quot; She did all the drawings and design but did not have an overall plan. She worked room by room. If she was unhappy with the results, she would tear the section down to rebuild, or abandon it for a while before returning to work on it again. The result was a rambling maze.

The windows, which are pastel-colored, asymmetrically designed and sharply bevelled, were initially believed to be made by Tiffany &amp; Co. Historian Jim Wolf believed that the windows were most likely made by glass artist John Mallon from Alexander Dunsmuir&#x27;s company, the Pacific American Decorative Company, since this style of glass could also be found at Craigdarroch Castle in British Columbia, Canada. Wolf&#x27;s theory was confirmed when an envelope with the Dunsmuir company seal on it, postmarked July 1894, was found within the walls of a dining room that was undergoing restoration. A note with Winchester&#x27;s handwriting was on the envelope.

The upper-level windows have a spider-web tracery, a popular design of the time. Windows on the right and left side of a brick fireplace have Shakespearean quotes from &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. Many of the windows purchased were never installed and are stored in the house.

After 1896, Winchester added stories to the then two story home. In some areas the home was five stories high and she added a seven-story tower that the &quot;San Jose News&quot; said was rebuilt sixteen times before Winchester was satisfied. She added state of the art plumbing and electrical systems for the time. She built an indoor garden with an irrigation system that watered the plants and sloping floors would channel the water to trap doors, which would then be piped to outdoor flower boxes. She installed an annunciator, a common, early version of intercom, to call servants.

Construction of the home was often delayed or stopped for months at a time.

The unusual design was not uncommon at the time. Elizabeth Colt, in Hartford, constructed a home over many years that was described as rambling and asymmetrical. Homes being constructed in the San Francisco area, such as Haas-Lilienthal, were described as &quot;crazy quilts&quot; being patched together.

She focused on her construction project instead of giving in to local rumors and insults. She kept tradespeople working during the many years the house was constructed. The house is Victorian, with Eastlake and Stick design elements. The original color was blue, but was later changed to yellow.

Winchester, over time, increased the size of her property around Llanada Villa from the original 45 acres to 160 acres.

In 1893, Winchester&#x27;s youngest sister, Estelle Pardee Gerard, became ill. She was moved from San Francisco to Llanada Villa with the hope that the dryer climate would improve her health. It did not, and in January 1894, Gerard died from cirrhosis despite being treated by Winchester&#x27;s personal physician, Meade.

===1906 San Francisco earthquake===
It is unknown if Winchester was at Llanada Villa during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake that caused tremendous damage to the building. Just prior to the earthquake, based on letters to her lawyer Leib, Winchester was at her home in Atherton.

Damage to Llanada Villa included a seven-story tower, the third and fourth floor additions and most of the chimneys collapsed. The plaster, wood and tile work was destroyed. Winchester had the debris cleared and the home made safe but no further building occurred. This left the home with water pipes protruding, second story doors opening to nothing where balconies once were, and staircases going up to a ceiling where once another level existed. Only essential repairs were done to the home after the earthquake. Because she stopped construction on her home and did not rebuild, local newspapers declared her a madwoman. The only thing she added to the home was an elevator in 1916.

===Other properties===
After purchasing the Llanada Villa, Winchester invested in more property in the area. She paid $10,000 gold coin for a home for the Merrimans. Extensive renovations and additions were made to this home direction of Winchester and her sister. As of 2018 this home was valued at almost seven million dollars.

Winchester purchased 140 acres of land next to the Merriman home with the intention of raising and marketing large carriage horses. The purchase of the land proved difficult since the land title was not clear. She hired Samuel Franklin &quot;Frank&quot; Leib to complete the purchase and sort out the title of the property. The horse business venture was not successful.

In 1903 Winchester purchased several properties in Atherton, one of which was purchased for the Marriotts to live in.

In 1904 Winchester purchased land in the San Francisco Bay area near Burlingame. After this Winchester commissioned the construction of an ark, or houseboat, which was a trend at the time, to be docked at her Burlingame property.

She owned multiple rental properties in Palo Alto, believing that property values near Stanford university would increase in value, two homes in Atherton, each on four acres, and thirty undeveloped acres of land. In 1907 she purchased a Tudor style home in Burlingame Park where she stayed while overseeing the dredging of a canal for her houseboat.

The houseboat remained unscathed after the San Francisco earthquake. Winchester and the Marriotts lived in the houseboat while repairs were made to their properties.

In 1907, Winchester purchased a home at 44 Inglewood Lane that became her full time home. This home was so attractive, a photo of it was featured in the program for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915.

===Presidential visits===
In 1901 President William McKinley visited the Santa Clara Valley and Winchester did not invite him to visit her despite the president knowing who her husband, Will, was and having recommended him to be added to a memorial list of Historic Families of America in Washington D.C.

In 1903 President Theodore Roosevelt visited California but did not visit Winchester. Rumors have persisted that Roosevelt attempted to visit her but her gate was locked. Roosevelt did not want to meet Winchester since he was worried that it would be seen as him promoting Winchester rifles. While president he was careful to not endorse any products. In addition, Winchester was not in San Jose but was in San Mateo preparing for her niece, Marian &quot;Daisy&quot; Merriman&#x27;s wedding to Frederick A. Marriott III.

===Politics===
Winchester mostly avoided politics but on one occasion she became vocal. In 1902, a candidate for county assessor named D. F. McGraw named Winchester in his campaign speeches stating she was only assessed $640 for all her properties, which he would rectify if voted in. In reality, she was assessed more than $80,000. The $640 was only for one of her many properties. Winchester sent him a letter that was published in a local newspaper expressing her anger, and rebuking him for lying. She accused him of only focusing on her in his campaign because she was a woman unable to vote. McGraw lost the election.

===Investments and projects===
In 1889 William Converse, the then president of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company and Winchester&#x27;s financial advisor, died. Winchester decided to look after her own finances from that point on and hired Leib as her lawyer.

In 1893 the stock market collapsed and many banks failed. While Winchester lost money on her investments, because she was very conservative with her decisions, she never suffered serious financial trouble.

By 1898, the Winchester Repeating Arms Company was profitable again. Winchester added William&#x27;s portion of company stock when her mother in law died the same year.

Winchester was successful with her real estate purchases, real estate investments and financial strategies that she sustained or improved her wealth.

After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Winchester undertook a project that she imagined would attract visitors to the Burlingame area. She envisioned coastal estates with personal docks and passages that visitors visiting California would enjoy after going through the soon to be completed Panama Canal. She designed and oversaw the construction of a system of canals with locks and installed a moon bridge near her houseboat. One of the contractors Winchester hired also rented some of her property to use as farmland. He also stole sand and gravel from her property, leaving the property with large ditches. It was stated that &quot;half the sidewalks in Burlingame were made from sand stolen from Winchester&#x27;s beach by a well-known contractor at the time.&quot; Winchester successfully sued the contractor for back rent, property damage, and stolen property. After the death of Carroll in 1909 at the age of fifty, Winchester lost interest in the canal project.

Winchester was so successful with her finances that between 1910 and 1912, she received $260,000 each year in stock dividends. However, in 1919, the Winchester Company was having financial difficulties and the value of her stocks decreased from ten million to about 3.75 million dollars.

===Philanthropy===

Most donations by Winchester were done anonymously, only known by her lawyer and discovered after her death from letters and ledgers. She supported social causes, such as being on the finance committee supporting a celebration of California&#x27;s fiftieth birthday in 1900, and being a paying member of a local chapter of the Red Cross. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Winchester donated $150 to the San Jose Relief Fund. She supported the &quot;Save the Redwoods&quot; campaign by donating $500.

After Frank Carroll&#x27;s sudden death, Winchester purchased a home for and continued to financially support Carroll&#x27;s wife and children.

Her largest donations were to the tubercular ward in New Haven. Initially Winchester donated $300,000 anonymously. Over a ten-year period, Winchester donated over a million dollars to the hospital, which opened on April 4, 1918, as the William Wirt Winchester Hospital. Winchester was not well enough to attend the dedication ceremony. The hospital became part of the Yale School of Medicine in 1948.

Because most were unaware of her philanthropy, the press and those who did not know her viewed her as miserly.

==Failing health and death==

By 1903, Winchester&#x27;s rheumatoid arthritis had disfigured her hands and feet, limiting her ability to walk and write. She was losing her teeth and required dentures. Writing was painful, requiring the help of a stenographer and her niece, Daisy. In 1911, her health improved somewhat, allowing her to sew, though the newspapers reported that she was close to death. At this time Winchester hired Henrietta Sivera to act as a nurse and secretary. She remained a trusted employee until Winchester&#x27;s death.

By 1920, Winchester rarely left her home, shopping for clothing and material via mail order or having store employees bring purchases out to her in her car.

September 1922, Winchester was driven from her home in Atherton to Llanada Villa to be closer to her doctor, who lived in San Jose. She died on Tuesday, September 5, 1922. She was buried in New Haven at Evergreen Cemetery beside her husband, William and her daughter, Annie.

Leib, who by that time had been her lawyer for more than twenty five years, looked after her bequests in her will. Her estate was estimated to be worth between three and four million dollars, considerably less than what her estate was rumored to be worth. Winchester named five of her closest employees in her will, along with all of her living family members. Her niece, Daisy, inherited a home in Palo Alto and the contents of all other homes. Any remaining money left in the trusts that she set up for family members was to be left to the William Wirt Winchester Hospital when they died. The will stated that if anyone disputed her wishes they would receive nothing.

Most of Winchester&#x27;s properties were sold off. However, the Llanada Villa was in such poor repair that it was deemed worthless and that only the property held value. John Brown was the only person interested in the land but he was unable to purchase it so a lease agreement was reached. Six months after Winchester&#x27;s death her home was opened as a tourist attraction. Brown purchased the property in 1931.

==Superstition and madness==
In 1908, the first mention of angry spirits haunting Winchester appeared in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; with rumors she was considering selling Llanada Villa. These stories spread to encapsulate all her properties. The rumors stated that if she sold any, she believed she would die, and there were hints she was involved with the occult. Despite these rumors, Winchester sold one of her Atherton homes.

Incorrect rumors spread about Winchester&#x27;s houseboat, stating that she purchased the boat after the earthquake for fear of a biblical flood. This is incorrect since she purchased the houseboat two years prior to the earthquake because they were popular at the time.

The rumors painted her as mentally unstable, filled with superstition, guilt and fear.

Fred Larsen, Winchester&#x27;s chauffeur after Carroll&#x27;s death, Ted Hansen, an employee&#x27;s son who grew up at Llanada Villa, Frank Leib, Winchester&#x27;s lawyer, Miss Henrietta Severs, Winchester&#x27;s companion of many years, were all people who openly stated that Winchester was not superstitious but was intelligent and kind. None of her former employees, servants or relatives ever claimed she was mad or superstitious.

==Winchester Mystery House==

Since the Winchester Mystery House opened as an attraction in 1923, the owners chose to embrace and expand upon the rumors and stories that had been in print and discussed by the community. These stories have persisted and been written about extensively.

Winchester is depicted as superstitious and crazy instead of innovative and intelligent. She had an apparent love of the number thirteen, demonstrated by thirteen chandeliers, bathrooms, thirteen hooks and thirteen robes, which were all added after Winchester&#x27;s death according to carpenter James Perkins. She is said to have built the maze of a home to ward off and confuse evil spirits, never stopping construction for 38 years for fear of dying, when in fact she stopped construction many times, including after the 1906 earthquake devastated the home. The room that she was purported to hold nightly seances with the spirits, was actually her gardener&#x27;s bedroom.

Despite claims that the house is the most haunted house in the United States, according to investigator Joe Nickell, there is no evidence that the Winchester Mystery House is haunted.

Her staff, friends and family were unhappy with the rumors surrounding Winchester and her house and the Carrolls were distressed that Winchester&#x27;s house was turned into a haunted tourist attraction.

<text>La Venta is a pre-Columbian archaeological site of the Olmec civilization located in the present-day Mexican state of Tabasco. Some of the artifacts have been moved to the museum &quot;Parque - Museo de La Venta&quot;, which is in nearby Villahermosa, the capital of Tabasco.

==Overview==
The Olmec were one of the first civilizations to develop in the Americas. Chronologically, the history of the Olmecs can be divided into the Early Formative (1800-900 BCE), Middle Formative (900-400 BCE) and Late Formative (400 BCE-200AD). The Olmecs are known as the &quot;mother culture&quot; of Mesoamerica, meaning that the Olmec civilization was the first culture that spread and influenced Mesoamerica. The spread of Olmec culture eventually led to cultural features found throughout all Mesoamerican societies.

Rising from the sedentary agriculturalists of the Gulf Lowlands as early as 1600 BCE in the Early Formative period, the Olmecs held sway in the Olmec heartland, an area on the southern Gulf of Mexico coastal plain, in Veracruz and Tabasco. Prior to the site of La Venta, the first Olmec site of San Lorenzo dominated the modern day state of Veracruz (1200-900 BCE).

Roughly long and wide, with the Coatzalcoalcos River system running through the middle, the heartland is home to the major Olmec sites of La Venta, San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, Laguna de los Cerros, and Tres Zapotes.

By no later than 1200 BCE, San Lorenzo had emerged as the most prominent Olmec center. While a layer of occupation at La Venta dates to 1200 BCE, La Venta did not reach its apogee until the decline of San Lorenzo, after 900 BCE. After 500 years of pre-eminence, La Venta was all but abandoned by the beginning of the fourth century BCE.

Located on an island in a coastal swamp overlooking a former river, the Río Palma, or Río Barí, La Venta probably controlled a region between the Mezcalapa and Coatzacoalcos rivers. The site itself is about inland at an elevation of less than 10 meters above sea level with the island consisting of slightly more than of dry land, resting on the largest alluvial plane in Mexico. The humid tropical climate of La Venta has an average annual temperature of 26 degrees Celsius and an average annual rainfall of 2,000 millimeters. La Venta is located at the nexus of four different ecosystems: marshes, mangrove swamps, tropical forest, and the Gulf of Mexico.

&quot;There was a large resident population at the site, a number of specialists not dedicated to food production, and political, religious, economic, and/or military relations with other sites within its area of influence.&quot; Unfortunately, few, if any, of the residential structures surrounding the large centers of the city have survived. The main part of the site is a complex of clay constructions stretched out for in a north-south direction, although the site is oriented 8° west of north. The urbanized zone may have covered an area as large of 2 km2. This particular site layout is the way the city was from 600 – 400 BCE, which is when the final Olmec occupation occurred. This site is particularly fascinating because of its layout—not only does Complex A face within 8 degrees of true North, but the east and west sides of the site are almost identical, showing bilateral symmetry. This is perhaps related to religion (it’s fairly speculative, at this point) but it certainly shows a high level of sophistication and city-planning.

Unlike later Maya or Aztec cities, La Venta was built from earth and clay—there was little locally abundant stone for the construction. Large basalt stones were brought in from the Tuxtla Mountains, but these were used nearly exclusively for monuments including the colossal heads, the &quot;altars&quot; (actually thrones), and various stelae. For example, the basalt columns that surround Complex A were quarried from Punta Roca Partida, on the Gulf coast north of the San Andres Tuxtla volcano. &quot;Little more than half of the ancient city survived modern disturbances enough to map accurately.&quot; Today, the entire southern end of the site is covered by a petroleum refinery and has been largely demolished, making excavations difficult or impossible. Many of the site&#x27;s monuments are now on display in the archaeological museum and park in the city of Villahermosa, Tabasco.

==Major features of La Venta==


La Venta was a civic and ceremonial center. While it may have included as-yet-undiscovered regal residences, habitation for the non-regal elite and the commoners were located at outlying sites such as San Andrés. Instead of dwellings, La Venta is dominated by a restricted sacred area (Complex A), the Great Pyramid (Complex C), and the large plaza to their south.

As a ceremonial center, La Venta contains an elaborate series of buried offerings and tombs, as well as monumental sculptures. These stone monuments, stelae, and &quot;altars&quot; were carefully distributed amongst the mounds and platforms. The mounds and platforms were built largely from local sands and clays. It is assumed that many of these platforms were once topped with wooden structures, which have long since disappeared.

===Complex C (The Great Pyramid)===
Complex C, &quot;The Great Pyramid,&quot; is the central building in the city layout, is constructed almost entirely out of clay, and is visible from a distance. The structure is built on top of a closed-in platform—this is where Blom and La Farge discovered Altars 2 and 3, thereby discovering La Venta and the Olmec civilization. A carbon sample from a burned area of the Structure C-1&#x27;s surface resulted in the date of 394 ± 30 BCE.

One of the earliest pyramids known in Mesoamerica, the Great Pyramid is high and contains an estimated 100,000 cubic meters of earth fill. The current conical shape of the pyramid was once thought to represent nearby volcanoes or mountains, but recent work by Rebecca Gonzalez Lauck has shown that the pyramid was in fact a rectangular pyramid with stepped sides and inset corners, and the current shape is most likely due to 2,500 years of erosion. The pyramid itself has never been excavated, but a magnetometer survey in 1967 found an anomaly high on the south side of the pyramid. Speculation ranges from a section of burned clay to a cache of buried offerings to a tomb.

===Complex A===
Complex A is a mound and plaza group located just to the north of the Great Pyramid (Complex C). The centerline of Complex A originally oriented to Polaris (true north) which indicates the Olmec had some knowledge of astronomy. Surrounded by a series of basalt columns, which likely restricted access to the elite, it was erected in a period of four construction phases that span over four centuries (1000 – 600 BCE). Beneath the mounds and plazas were found a vast array of offerings and other buried objects, more than 50 separate caches by one count, including buried jade, polished mirrors made of iron-ores, and five large &quot;Massive Offerings&quot; of serpentine blocks. It is estimated that Massive Offering 3 contains 50 tons of carefully finished serpentine blocks, covered by 4,000 tons of clay fill.

Also unearthed in Complex A were three rectangular mosaics (also known as &quot;Pavements&quot;) each roughly and each consisting of up to 485 blocks of serpentine. These blocks were arranged horizontally to form what has been variously interpreted as an ornate Olmec bar-and-four-dots motif, the Olmec Dragon, a very abstract jaguar mask, a cosmogram, or a symbolic map of La Venta and environs. Not intended for display, soon after completion these pavements were covered over with colored clay and then many feet of earth.

Five formal tombs were discovered within Complex A, one with a sandstone sarcophagus carved with what seemed to be an crocodilian earth monster. Diehl states that these tombs &quot;are so elaborate and so integrated to the architecture that it seems clear that Complex A really was a mortuary complex dedicated to the spirits of deceased rulers&quot;.

Other notable artifacts within Complex A include:
* Monument 19. This relief sculpture is the earliest known example of the feathered serpent in Mesoamerica.
* Offering 4.

===Complex B===
South of the Great Pyramid lies Complex B. Whereas Complex A was apparently restricted to the elite, the plaza of Complex B seems to be built specifically for large public gatherings. This plaza is just south of the Great Pyramid, east of the Complex B platforms, and west of the huge raised platform referred to as the Stirling Acropolis. This plaza is nearly long and over wide. A small platform is situated in the center of the plaza.

This layout has led researchers to propose that the platforms surrounding the plaza functioned as stages where ritual drama was enacted for viewers within the plaza. These rituals were likely related to the &quot;altars&quot;, monuments, and the stelae surrounding and within the plaza. These monuments, including Colossal Head 1 (Monument 1), were of such a large size and were placed in such a position that they could convey their messages to many viewers at once.

===Complex E===
Though there are not any actual houses remaining in this area (or anywhere at La Venta) &quot;a chemical evaluation of the soil revealed unusual concentrations of phosphate, indicating the possibility it had been a residential zone.&quot;

===Summary===
The arrangement of the mounds, platforms, complexes, and monumental artifacts at La Venta created a unique civil and ceremonial center that, in the words of Rebecca Gonzalez-Lauck, constitutes &quot;one of the earliest examples of large-scale ideological communications through the interaction of architecture and sculpture&quot;.

==Monumental artifacts at La Venta==
===Colossal heads===
Certainly the most famous of the La Venta monumental artifacts are the four colossal heads. Seventeen colossal heads have been unearthed in the Olmec area, four of them at La Venta, officially named Monuments 1 through 4.

Three of the heads—Monuments 2, 3, and 4—were found roughly 150 meters north of Complex A, which is itself just north of the Great Pyramid. These heads were in a slightly irregular row, facing north. The other colossal head—Monument 1 (shown at left) – is a few dozen meters south of the Great Pyramid.

The La Venta heads are thought to have been carved by 700 BCE, but possibly as early as 850 BCE, while the San Lorenzo heads are credited to an earlier period. The colossal heads can measure up to in height and weigh several tons. The sheer size of the stones causes a great deal of speculation on how the Olmec were able to move them. The major basalt quarry for the colossal heads at La Venta was found at Cerro Cintepec in the Tuxtla Mountains, over 80 km away.

Each of the heads wears headgear reminiscent of 1920s-style American football helmets, although each is unique in its decoration. The consensus is that the heads likely represent mighty Olmec rulers.

===Altars 4 &amp; 5===
Seven basalt &quot;altars&quot; were found at La Venta, including Altar 4 and Altar 5. These altars, roughly 2 meters high and twice as wide, feature an elaborately dressed and sculpted figure on the center front.

The figure on Altar 4 is sitting inside what appears to be a cave or the mouth of a fantastic creature, holding a rope which wraps around the base of the altar to his right and left. On the left side, the rope is connected to a seated bas-relief figure. The right side is eroded away but is thought to be similar to the scene on the left.

The consensus today is that these &quot;altars&quot; are thrones on which the Olmec rulers were seated during important rituals or ceremonies. This leads many researchers to interpret the figure at the front of Altar 4 as a ruler, who is contacting or being helped by his ancestors, the figures on either side of the altar. Alternatively, some believe the side figures to be bound captives.

Altar 5 faces Altar 4 across Structure D-8 (one of the dozens of mounds at La Venta, the remains of platforms). Altar 5 is similar in design and size to Altar 4, except that the central figure holds an inert, perhaps dead, were-jaguar baby. The left side of Altar 5 features bas-reliefs of humans holding quite lively were-jaguar babies. Like the Altar 4, the right side of Altar 5 has been defaced.

Some have seen child sacrifice echoed in the limp were-jaguar baby on the front of Altar 5. Others, however, view the tableau as a myth of human emergence or as story of a spiritual journey.

Although less striking and displaying a lesser degree of craftsmanship, Altars 2 and 3 are similar to Altars 4 and 5. They each show a central figure, one with a baby and one without, and they sit facing each other on the southern edge of the Great Pyramid.

==Social structure==
La Venta was the cultural capital of the Olmec concentration in the region. It contained a &quot;concentration of power,&quot; as reflected by the sheer scale of the architecture and the extreme value of the artifacts uncovered. La Venta is perhaps the largest Olmec city and it was controlled and expanded by an extremely complex hierarchical system with a king, as the ruler and the elites below him. Priests had power and influence over life and death and likely great political sway as well. Unfortunately, not much is known about the political or social structure of the Olmec, though new dating techniques might, at some point, reveal more information about this elusive culture. It is possible that the signs of status exist in the artifacts recovered at the site such as depictions of feathered headdresses or of individuals wearing a mirror on their chest or forehead. &quot;High-status objects were a significant source of power in the La Venta polity political power, economic power, and ideological power. They were tools used by the elite to enhance and maintain rights to rulership.&quot;

It has been estimated that La Venta would need to be supported by a population of at least 18,000 people during its principal occupation. To add to the mystique of La Venta, the alluvial soil did not preserve skeletal remains, so it is difficult to observe differences in burials. However, colossal heads provide proof that the elite had some control over the lower classes, as their construction would have been extremely labor-intensive. &quot;Other features similarly indicate that many laborers were involved.&quot; In addition, excavations over the years have discovered that different parts of the site were likely reserved for elites and other parts for non-elites. This segregation of the city indicates that there must have been social classes and therefore social inequality.

==Burials==
Several burials have been found at La Venta, especially in Mound A, but none have skeletal remains as the environment is too humid for organic preservation. &quot;Organic materials do not preserve well in the acidic soils of La Venta. The only organics recovered at the site include traces of long bones, a burned skullcap, a few milk teeth, a shark&#x27;s tooth, and stingray spines—all found in the basalt tomb [Structure A-2].&quot; Offerings of jade celts and figures seem to be commonplace and were likely concentrated in burials (though this cannot be confirmed because there are no human remains still present). Artifacts, such as jade earspools, beads, pendants, spangles, plaques, and other jewelry, were found in plenty at burial sites; however it is difficult to tell if they were worn or placed in the grave as burial goods.

===Structure A-2===
Structure A-2 (Mound A) is an earthen platform thought to be a burial site (a &quot;funerary chamber&quot;). Inside the platform, researchers discovered badly preserved bones covered in a red pigment, cinnabar, a substance used in similar Mesoamerican cultures to denote status. Also found were jade artifacts, figurines and masks, as well as polished obsidian mirrors. Mirrors are also suspected to be a mark of rank among the Olmec, as stelae and other monuments display leaders and priests wearing them on their chest and on their foreheads. &quot;Throughout the layer [uncovered by Stirling in 1942] were copious unrestorable traces of organic material. The red cinnabar lay in a fashion which gave the impression that it had been inside of wrapped bundles. Probably the bodies had been thus wrapped before interment.&quot; 

===Urn burials===
Rust (2008) discovered &quot;urn burials&quot; in Complex E (residential area) where fragments of bone and teeth were buried in clay pots. &quot;The fill immediately around this large urn was clean, yellow sand, and the urn was covered with an inverted fine-paste orange bowl with flaring walls; the bowl&#x27;s interior was painted red and incised with the double-line-break pattern on the inside rim.&quot;

==Religion and ideology==
&quot;For decades, certain scholars have used shamanism as an explanatory paradigm for considering the monuments of La Venta... one of the most important ceremonial-civic centers of the Middle Formative era. Most of what is known about Olmec religion is speculative, but certain patterns do emerge at La Venta that are certainly symbolic and might have ritual meaning. For example, the crossed bands symbol, an X in a rectangular box, is often repeated in stone at La Venta, other Olmec sites, and continued to have significance to the cultures inspired by the Olmec. It often appears in conjunction with the maize deity and so might have connection with subsistence.

The artifacts discovered at La Venta have been crucial to starting to understand Olmec religion and ideology. For example, hematite and iron-ore mirror fragments have been discovered in abundance at La Venta. Mirrors were an incredibly important part of Olmec society, used in both rituals and daily life. Celts, or &quot;pseudo-axes,&quot; are extremely common in both burials and offerings. It is unclear whether these artifacts were actually used in any practical way or if their meaning is ritual or symbolic. Most are smooth, but quite a few are decorated with what has been interpreted as representing religious symbolism. Such celts and other jade artifacts were offered to deities during ceremonies at La Venta and the belief in supernatural beings is evidenced in Olmec artifacts. However, it is difficult to tell which important figures remaining on the stone monuments and artifacts are gods and which are human leaders. In fact, there might have been little difference between the divine and the Olmec king, in their ideology.

Structures at La Venta show that &quot;various architectural-sculptural canons were firmly established—canons that were, in essence, used in civic-ceremonial constructions throughout the cultural history of ancient Middle America.&quot; In other words, most of what we know about the Olmec, from La Venta, comes from the architecture and artifacts left behind and from these clues it can be discerned that Maya and Aztec culture and ideology was heavily influenced by the Olmec &quot;mother culture.&quot;

There is a definite connection between animals and spirituality among the Olmec, especially with animal characteristics combined with human features. This is represented in Olmec &quot;art&quot; and those with elite status would have worn elaborate headdresses of feathers and other animal forms. Ocean creatures were also sacred to the Olmec—Pohl (2005) found shark teeth and sting ray remains at feasting sites at San Andres and it is clear that those at La Venta shared in the same ideology. &quot;Zoomorphic forms reference sharks and birds, and both collections contain representations of the quincunx symbol, a conceptualization of the cosmos in Mesoamerican thought.&quot;

&quot;Given the lack of written documents in Formative Mesoamerica, there is no foolproof strategy for interpreting Olmec visual culture.&quot; However, it is almost certain that the Olmec had some form of a writing system that utilized symbols, as evidenced in the cylinder seal and other forms of writing found at nearby elite-center, San Andres.

==Agriculture and economy==
The wild flora and fauna greatly varied at La Venta and mostly consisted of seafood, deer, and a variety of small animals, as well as many wild plants. The only animals domesticated by the Olmec were dogs and, therefore, La Venta and surrounding areas largely depended on wild game. However, the rich, alluvial soil along the river banks allowed for multiple harvests every year and the land, in general, was quite bountiful. &quot;Evidence has been found for corn (&quot;Zea mais&quot;) of teosinte size associated with ceramic material dated to 1750 BCE.&quot; Maize was the primary domesticated food source and Seinfeld&#x27;s (2007) study of feasting at the nearby sub-city of San Andres uncovered likely maize use in beverages, as well as cocoa.

Basalt rock was brought in from the Tuxtla Mountains to make stone monuments. Whether or not this is an example of trade with another culture is uncertain. La Venta had a strong concentration of specialized craftsmen and so it is entirely possible that more goods were exported than imported. This local exchange, and the resulting relationship system, is important, though, because it increased and consolidated the power of the elites with luxury goods and feasting foods like cacao and maize beer. &quot;Participation in regional and long-distance exchange networks provided the La Venta ruling elite with a significant source of legitimizing power.&quot;

==Discovery and excavation==
Frans Blom and Oliver La Farge made the first detailed descriptions of La Venta during their 1925 expedition, sponsored by Tulane University. Originally La Venta was thought to be a Mayan site. It wasn&#x27;t until more sophisticated radiocarbon techniques were developed in the 1950s that Olmec sites were irrefutably dated as preceding the Maya.

La Venta was first excavated by Matthew Stirling and Philip Drucker (assisted by Waldo Wedel in 1943, due to Drucker&#x27;s military service during WWII) between 1940 and 1943, resulting in several articles by Stirling and in 1952 a two-volume monograph by Drucker. Stirling is sometimes credited with identifying the Olmec civilization; although some Olmec sites and monuments had been known earlier, it was Stirling&#x27;s work that put the Olmec culture into context. This first excavation was funded by the National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Institution and focused on collecting samples using stratipits.

In 1955, Drucker led a new excavation, funded again by the National Geographic Society, concentrating on Complex A and finally reaching the subsoil at the site, established stratigraphy to discover the constructional history. They discovered more jade artifacts, which were interpreted as ritual offerings, as well as pottery shards. The findings were published by Drucker, Robert Heizer and Robert Squier, (who were also assisted by Eduardo Contreras and Pierre Agrinier) in 1959. At this point most of the site was still unexcavated and in a strongly worded passage Heizer reported that the site was inadequately protected by the Mexican government and a wave of illegal excavations followed the departure of the archaeologists, as well as damage by urban sprawl, the national oil company, Pemex, and the removal of large monuments to museums (without leaving markers as to their original positions).

Several subsequent excavations followed through the 1960s, funded by generous grants from the National Geographic Society. On their return in 1967, Drucker and Heizer saw that, as others had already claimed, the vegetation previously covering the mound, as well as their own assumptions, had led to them previously publishing a completely wrong account of its shape. It was in fact a round fluted cone with ten ridges and depressions around it, rather than the sloping rectangle, leading to a flat platform that they had assumed. Possibly the shape was intended to match or represent the mountains nearby. They also obtained better carbon samples in order to achieve one of the key goals of the excavation of La Venta—proving that the Olmec were a distinct and separate culture that pre-dates the first Maya settlements.

Rebecca Gonzalez-Lauck led an INAH (Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia) team on several digs at La Venta in the 1980s. Her team focused on mapping the site and &quot;ended and reversed the urban encroachment on the archaeological site of La Venta and created a program of protection, restoration, and research.&quot; Their efforts have opened the site to a new generation of graduate students and other anthropologists, who continue to uncover new evidence about the mysterious Olmec.

A ceramic cylinder was recovered from the nearby San Andrés La Venta site that dates to around 650 BCE that brings evidence to the argument that a writing system existed at this site. A bird image is connected to two glyphs on speech scrolls that represent the date 3 Ajaw on the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar. The seal increases the likelihood that a writing system existed as well as a 260-day calendar during this time period.

==Chronology==
“Because of extremely poor viewing conditions in the tropical rainforest, different parts of La Venta were discovered piecemeal, and it was decades before scholars realized that all the platforms and stone sculptures found in the vicinity were part of a single site, an ancient city that was occupied from 900-400 BCE.” Phases I- IV are dated based on radiocarbon dates from Complex A, with approximately one hundred years between each phase. Unfortunately, excavating Complex A led to the destruction of the original integrity of the site and has made it difficult to go back and re-verify the dates. This is why La Venta has a rather loose chronology that cannot be made any more definitive.

&quot;Phase I&quot;—dated with five radiocarbon samples (from the stratigraphy at Complex A) that have the average age of 2770 ± 134 years old (814 BCE +/- 134 years)

&quot;Phase II&quot;—dated with a single sample at 804 BCE

&quot;Phase III&quot;—no radiocarbon dates

&quot;Phase IV&quot;—no radiocarbon dates, from Post-Phase IV dates, Heizer and Drucker estimated the end of Phase IV somewhere between 450 and 325 BCE

Post-&quot;Phase IV&quot;—two samples average 2265 years old (309 BCE)

Conclusion: The La Venta site was used from (approximately) 800- 400 BCE, during the Formative Period. Complex A at the site was built and rebuilt during this period and this date range comes from carbon samples from construction fills. Rebecca Gonzalez Lauck asserts that the Olmec concentration at La Venta occurred from 1200 – 400 BCE and the overriding point seems to be that an exact chronology has proved to be elusive.

==Threats to La Venta==
On January 11, 2009, 23 ancient Olmec sculptures were damaged with a mixture of salt water, grape juice, and oil by a group attempting to perform a supposed pre-Columbian ritual to bring about peace and world-healing. The group of two Mexicans, Roberto Conde Díaz and José Pablo Megenes Jasso, and an American citizen, Wanda Ivette Aguilar were alleged members of a Christian sect called &quot;Nueva Generación&quot;.

The incident prompted Mexican legislators to draft legislation &quot;that would increase fines and jail time for vandalism and looting of monuments and archaeological sites.&quot;

<text>The Communist Party USA and its allies played an important role in the United States labor movement, particularly in the 1930s and 1940s, but wasn&#x27;t successful either in bringing the labor movement around to its agenda of fighting for socialism and full workers&#x27; control over industry, or in converting their influence in any particular union into membership gains for the Party. The CP has had only negligible influence in labor since its supporters&#x27; defeat in internal union political battles in the aftermath of World War II and the CIO&#x27;s expulsion of the unions in which they held the most influence in 1950. After the expulsion of the Communists, organized labor in the United States began to decline.

Historians disagree why the union movement never formed a labor party and why American workers have never embraced socialist parties in any numbers in the last ninety years. Some have argued that a strain of American exceptionalism made U.S. workers resistant to parties that emphasized class struggle; others have attributed the left&#x27;s failure to its own successes in building strong unions, but at the cost of downplaying its own political and social agendas for the sake of unity or short-term gains. Others take just the opposite position: that the left lost its power to lead the labor movement by its ideological zig-zags. The CP&#x27;s history within the labor movement can support all of these theses.

==CPUSA&#x27;s founding and early years==
The Communist Party of the USA was founded in 1919, out of two groups who broke from the Socialist Party of America when it refused to join the Comintern. The original core of the CP believed that the triumph of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia meant that the revolution was at hand in the West as well.

The CP&#x27;s initial attitude towards unions reflected that millenarian view. At the time of its founding, according to a leader of the party, &quot;it would have been difficult to gather a half dozen delegates who knew anything about the trade union movement.&quot; The Party also became a largely clandestine organization during the immediate post-war years, as the Palmer Raids led to the arrest and deportation of thousands of Party members.

The CP at that time looked on the American Federation of Labor as an enemy to be destroyed in order to eliminate the temptations of reformism rather than revolution. They also looked down on most trade union activities as insufficiently revolutionary: even though the labor movement was engaged in a number of strikes in 1919, including a general strike in Seattle, Washington, the Party&#x27;s members had no role in them. Instead they urged workers to put aside their short-term economic goals and to concentrate on overthrowing the state.

The Profintern, or &quot;Red International of Labor Unions,&quot; forced the CP to change in 1921, when it directed U.S. communists to work within the AFL in order to make it a revolutionary body – what an earlier generation of SP members referred to as &quot;boring from within.&quot; In order to accomplish this, the Profintern recognized the Trade Union Educational League, an organization founded by William Z. Foster, as its U.S. affiliate.

Foster had been, prior to his agreement to bring the TUEL under the wing of the CP, a syndicalist, who believed that workers would seize power through workers&#x27; organizations, such as unions, rather than through political organizations, such as a communist party. He had led the AFL&#x27;s failed 1919 strike in the steel industry and had established particularly close relations then with John Fitzpatrick, the President of the Chicago Federation of Labor.

TUEL functioned within existing unions, trying to organize support for industrial unionism, a labor party, organizing the unorganized and the Soviet Union. TUEL strove to create alliances with leaders who shared some of its agenda, while trying to build a base for left unionism at the local level.

After some organizational successes, however, TUEL managed to alienate Fitzpatrick, leaving them without major allies when the AFL denounced TUEL as a &quot;dual union&quot; and expelled TUEL members in 1924. The CPUSA lost more allies when, under orders from the Comintern, it withdrew its previous enthusiastic support for the Progressive Party candidacy of Robert La Follette, Sr. for president in 1924.

The CP, on the other hand, had some short-lived successes in the labor movement without the TUEL&#x27;s help. The CP had broad support in the early 1920s among the radical, largely immigrant, garment workers in New York City. A number of CP members won leadership positions in three major International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union (ILGWU) locals in New York City in 1924 and offices in other locals in Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia. They held on to those offices despite the attempts by the Socialist leadership of the ILGWU to oust them.

But in 1926 the left leadership in New York forfeited everything they had when they lost a strike of 40,000 cloakmakers. The local union leadership lost the strike in large part because of the internal factionalism within the CP: when the union had the opportunity to settle on terms that were less than what the union had demanded, the union&#x27;s leaders went to the CP for approval of the deal. But the Party&#x27;s fraction within the union was reluctant to accept it, afraid that this would open them up to charges of softness in intra-Party factional warfare. The strike dragged on another few months, at which point the locals accepted an inferior agreement.

That gave the International union the opportunity it needed: the Socialist leadership of the ILGWU took over the exhausted locals after they settled and their supporters were too dispirited to resist. While the CP retained a strong base of support in the smaller Fur Workers Union, it never recovered from its defeat in the much larger garment industry; on the contrary, the ILGWU, led by David Dubinsky for the next forty years, remained resolutely anti-communist thereafter.

The TUEL itself changed for brief period into the dual union that the AFL had accused it of being. The TUEL led a strike of woolen industry workers in Passaic, New Jersey in 1926 — until, that is, the Comintern instructed the Party later that year to abandon any independent unions it had formed on the ground that these represented ultra-left adventurism. The strike, which would probably have been lost in any case, ended six months later in defeat after the AFL&#x27;s United Textile Workers took over leadership of the strike.

==CPUSA turns left and the Trade Union Unity League==

The Comintern&#x27;s repudiation of dual unionism in 1926 turned out, however, to be only a temporary change in policy; in 1928 the CP began establishing new CP-led unions in the coal, textile, food and garment industries and renamed the TUEL the Trade Union Unity League in 1929. This change in policy coincided with Stalin&#x27;s turn to the left as he moved against his former ally Nikolai Bukharin. CP leaders, such as Foster, willing to make the switch, held on to their positions in the Party, while those who did not, such as Jay Lovestone, were expelled.

The CP&#x27;s Third Period stance towards unions was nearly as ultra-left as its position in 1919 through 1921. While advocating a &quot;united front from below,&quot; the Party attacked other socialist parties as &quot;social fascists&quot; and denounced the AFL as &quot;an organ to suppress and disorganize the masses&quot; which workers should join only to &quot;overthrow the reformist bureaucracy&quot; that ran them. The CP instead focused on founding new revolutionary unions in the expectation that the collapse of capitalism was just around the corner.

These new dual unions were, in fact, often more like ginger groups than unions, with few members and even fewer long-term members. Nonetheless these groups did make some heroic efforts to organize the unorganized. In 1929 the National Textile Workers led a strike of thousands of textile workers in Gastonia, North Carolina, who walked out, despite the NTW&#x27;s attempts to hold them back, after management fired five union activists. That strike was crushed after mobs of citizens smashed up union offices and murdered a union activist.

While local authorities, preachers and newspapers played up the National Textile Workers&#x27; association with godless communism and its opposition to white supremacy, it is unlikely that this made much difference in the final analysis. The authorities reacted just as violently when the much less radical AFL intervened after a spontaneous strike of textile workers erupted in other mill towns several months later. That strike likewise ended in mass arrests and the killing of three strikers, shot in the back by sheriffs.

===Miners&#x27; unions===
The CP&#x27;s efforts in mining were just as unsuccessful. The CP had once had a good deal of support in the internecine struggles within the United Mine Workers in the 1920s, when John L. Lewis used every weapon available to defeat his rivals for union leadership while wages and working conditions in the industry grew worse. The TUEL-supported candidate who ran for UMW President against Lewis in the 1924 election was credited with 66,000 votes in the official tally – nearly half what Lewis received. The CP later allied itself, for a time, with John Brophy, whose &quot;Save the Union&quot; slate probably would have won election to national leadership in 1926 if the vote had been held democratically.

Lewis, however, effectively drove all of the TUEL and Brophy supporters from the union after his victory in 1926. The CP later burned its bridges with Brophy, denouncing him as a reformist.

The CP founded its own National Miners Union in 1928. It engaged in a fierce struggle to undo wage cuts when miners struck in Pennsylvania and Ohio mines in 1931, but lost the strike when mine operators chose to recognize the UMW – which had not been involved in the strike – rather than the NMU, then obtained an injunction to prevent the NMU from picketing.

The NMU also took on the leadership of a strike that the UMW had called in Harlan County, Kentucky in 1931 with even more disastrous results, since the union was not prepared to provide the relief necessary to permit strikers to remain out for any length of time, particularly in the face of attacks by &quot;gun thugs.&quot; The NMU&#x27;s strong opposition to racial discrimination and wholehearted support for the Soviet Union also served to alienate it from the mostly fundamentalist and predominantly white miners in Harlan County. While the strike publicized the horrific conditions in one of the most isolated parts of Appalachia, it did not produce any concrete benefits for striking miners.

There were, however, some bright spots for the CP: their Food Workers Industrial Union successfully organized cafeteria and restaurant workers, particularly in New York, where many of the restaurant workers unions had been taken over by Dutch Schultz as part of his labor rackets. Those CP-led unions not only fended off Schultz&#x27;s gangsters, but thrived, and became dominant within the AFL Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees union in New York when they affiliated with it several years later.

The Maritime Workers Industrial Union did not survive the Third Period, but it left its mark. Sailors and longshoremen had a tradition of radical politics and more or less spontaneous job actions; the IWW had been particularly active in both east and west coast ports up through the 1920s. The Marine Workers Industrial Union (MWIU) organized occasional strikes, attacked the inadequate relief provided for unemployed workers by the YMCA and other groups, and distributed the MWIU&#x27;s newspapers. These programs attracted a number of sailors and longshoremen, including Harry Bridges, who subsequently led the west coast longshore strike of 1934.

The TUUL had similar limited success in the automobile industry, where it established shop nuclei that linked the Party with the campaign for industrial unionism. The CP was, however, more successful in organizing unemployed workers in Detroit and other auto centers than it was in recruiting or organizing auto workers.

==Early years of the New Deal and founding of the CIO==

The CP initially looked on the New Deal and the Roosevelt administration as a form of fascism, because the National Industrial Recovery Act provided for a form of corporativist rule, calling on industries to negotiate codes that would regulate prices, production, labor relations and other matters with only indirect government supervision. The government panels created under the NRA generally gave in to employer demands and appeared to be more concerned with preventing strikes than with protecting workers&#x27; rights or living standards.

Workers flocked to unions for representation, often in advance of any union organizing efforts, in the belief that Roosevelt and the NRA would protect them. Lewis and the UMWA capitalized on this sentiment in 1933 when his organizers told miners that &quot;The President wants you to join the Union.&quot; While the UMWA organizers may have meant President Lewis, they did not correct the misimpression on the part of many miners who thought they meant President Roosevelt.

Workers engaged in a wave of strikes, the most since 1921, in 1934. The largest and most significant were three giant strikes for union recognition among longshoremen on the West Coast, truck drivers in Minneapolis, Minnesota and automobile workers in Toledo, Ohio. In each case the strike became either a general strike or something close to it.

In each case radicals, either associated with the CPUSA or other leftwing parties, played key leadership roles; the CP and its allies, such as Harry Bridges, played an important role in the west coast longshore strike. The CP&#x27;s influence depended, however, on the personal charisma of Harry Bridges and the hard work put in by its members and sympathizers on the docks, rather than on the MWIU itself, which largely disappeared when its radical cadres followed the membership into the newly revived west coast locals of the ILA. While Bridges was apparently never a member of the CP — something the government tried to prove, without success, in four different trials over more than a decade — he worked closely with Party activists and helped advance their careers within the union, while the union that grew out of the strike, the International Longshoremen and Warehousemen Union, espoused the party&#x27;s politics for decades.

The Party&#x27;s role in the founding of the Transport Workers Union of America was even clearer: two TUUL organizers, John Santo and Austin Hogan, were instrumental in the founding of the union in 1934, and almost all of its original leaders, including Mike Quill, were either Party members or close followers of Party policies. The TWU won the right to represent New York City&#x27;s public transit workers after several years of clandestine organizing, a series of small strikes, a sitdown strike in the BMT&#x27;s Kent Avenue powerhouse in 1937 and an overwhelming victory among IRT employees in an NLRB election several months later.

Yet while the CP played a leading role in that organization, Party members, even those whose party membership had been open in the past, chose to downplay or conceal their membership. Hogan, a CP candidate for Congress in 1934, kept his party affiliation private, to the extent that was possible, after he became President of TWU Local 100, the local of New York City subway workers. The party discontinued its shop papers, which went by names such as &quot;Red Dynamo&quot; and &quot;Red Express&quot;, in 1935, when TWU organizers claimed that the party&#x27;s overt role in the union was interfering with their efforts and when Popular Front alliance-building replaced Third Period separatism. While the party remained influential — some said dominant — in the union until 1949, and the union closely followed party policies on issues such as civil rights, public ownership of the subways and fare increases, the party took no credit for its contributions and party members vigorously rejected claims of employers, intra-union opponents and investigators that the party was, in fact, a major influence in the union.

===CIO===
The CP similarly gained influence at first in the newly formed Congress of Industrial Organizations, or CIO, on the strength of individual members&#x27; work. Lee Pressman, the General Counsel for the CIO and later the United Steelworkers of America, was a member of the CP and the underground Ware group involved in espionage for the Soviet Union. The first publicity director for the CIO, Len De Caux, was likewise a member of the CP throughout his years with the CIO as were many more organizers and rank-and-file activists within the unions affiliated with the CIO.

Individuals like Pressman and De Caux would not have considered working for the CIO if the CP had not shifted its position from sectarian purity to first a united front and later a popular front policy that favored alliances with other &quot;progressive forces.&quot; At the same time the New Deal was turning to the left, in response to both the increasingly hostile response by employers and the wave of worker discontent that had replaced the apathetic resignation of the first years of the Great Depression. The CP, having denounced Roosevelt as a fascist only a few years earlier, moved closer and closer to embracing him.

At the same time the CIO and other progressive organizations and individuals overcome many of their reservations about working with the CP. Of the two hundred or so organizers that Lewis hired for the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, sixty were CP members, with particular strength among the staff responsible for organizing foreign-born and African-American workers and in the Chicago area.

Lewis was not particularly concerned with the political beliefs of his organizers, so long as he controlled the organization. As he once famously remarked, &quot;I do not turn my organizers or CIO members upside down and shake them to see what kind of literature falls out of their pockets.&quot; He took the same line in private, when David Dubinsky of the ILGWU asked him about the communists on the SWOC staff; as he told Dubinsky, &quot;Who gets the bird? The hunter or the dog?&quot;

==Organizing basic industry==

The CP did not gain influence solely through seeking staff positions, however. In the rubber workers&#x27; strike in Akron, Ohio that represented the first test of the CIO&#x27;s ability to turn mass discontent into union gains, a number of rank-and-file leaders were also CP members. The Party had a degree of presence, both at the local and international level, in the United Rubber Workers union formed after the strike.

The CP also exerted a great deal of influence within the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (or UE), founded in 1936 by the merger of a number of federal unions created by the AFL and small shop caucuses, largely made up of CP activists and other socialists and radicals, at General Electric, Westinghouse Electric Company and other unorganized companies. The CP grew even more powerful within the UE in 1937 when James J. Matles, former head of the CP&#x27;s Metal Workers Industrial Union, brought in a number of locals after a brief affiliation with the International Association of Machinists. Matles and other CP members and allies held the bulk of the important positions within the UE for the next twelve years, until the CIO engineered a split within it in order to separate the Communist leaders from the CIO; they continued to hold power thereafter within that portion of the union that was not raided by the International Union of Electrical Workers.

===United Auto Workers===
The CP achieved even greater results, but less long-term success, working within the United Automobile Workers. Like the UE, the UAW was also formed in 1936 out of a number of federal unions created by the AFL and locals from other unions in the industry. Of its 25,000 workers, almost all came from outside Michigan.

One of the most prominent UAW activists in the early years of the union was Wyndham Mortimer, who had led a strike against White Motors in Cleveland, Ohio. Mortimer was elected vice-president at the UAW&#x27;s first convention and might have been elected president if not for concern about his Party membership.

Mortimer and the CP formed alliances at that first convention with George Addes, then the secretary-treasurer of the UAW, later its president, and Walter Reuther, who headed the UAW from 1947 until his death in 1970. The CP maintained its alliance with Addes, the center of the left-wing caucus within the UAW, for the next decade. Its alliance with Reuther proved much shorter.

When the UAW decided to organize the industry by going after General Motors, Mortimer was sent to Flint, Michigan, where GM&#x27;s production was centered. Even at that early stage factional infighting within the UAW, in particular between Mortimer and Homer Martin, the first President of the UAW, threatened to derail the campaign. When Martin pulled Mortimer out of Flint, Mortimer arranged for Bob Travis, another union activist and CP member from Toledo, to replace him.

Travis played an active role in the Flint Sit-Down Strike, aided by some veteran CP autoworkers inside Fisher Body Plant #1 – but also by other radical workers, some belonging to Trotskyist parties, the Socialist Party or the IWW. The same pattern applied outside the plants: Socialist Party members, such as Walter Reuther&#x27;s brothers Victor Reuther and Roy Reuther, and the Socialists and ex-Socialists working for the CIO cooperated with CP members, such as Henry Kraus, the UAW&#x27;s publicity director, with a minimum of sectarian bickering.

The CP, in fact, played down its revolutionary politics during the sit-down strike. In part this was to avoid giving GM and its allies an issue to use against the strike; in part it was out of fear of distancing the Party from the strikers, who were, in the opinion of CP leadership, using revolutionary means to achieve traditional union goals. The Socialists, by contrast, had a much smaller base within the striking workers, but were much more inclined to attach revolutionary significance to the sit-down strikes and to magnify their own role in them.

===Steelworkers===
The CP was even more circumspect in the Steel Workers Organizing Committee. The CP was anxious not to scare off its partners and employers in the CIO: its members therefore made no effort to advertise their Party affiliation and even took steps not to pack SWOC conventions.

Nor did circumstances give them much opportunity to rise to leadership. Unlike the UAW, which was born out of tumultuous struggles in which CP activists and other radicals played leading parts, the SWOC conducted a much more top-down organizing campaign subject to close control. SWOC organizers who belonged to the CP played an important role in recruiting and organizing members, but rarely stayed in one area long enough to cultivate the sort of relations with local leaders that might have allowed them to recruit them into the Party, if they had tried to do so. They simply did not have the freedom of action that Mortimer, Travis and others within the UAW did.

Nor did they have the same power. As staff members, Pressman, de Caux and the SWOC organizers who belonged to the CP had, at most, only indirect influence on CIO or SWOC policy and no independent base to rally support or propagandize for other issues. Philip Murray, a former UMWA associate whom Lewis installed as head of the SWOC, weeded out most of the Communists from the union over the years after the initial organizing drives as the SWOC became the United Steelworkers of America. By 1942 the purge was almost complete.

<text>Crow The Robot is a fictional character from the American science fiction comedy television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (&quot;MST3K&quot;). Crow is a robot, who, along with others, ridicules poor-quality B to Z movies.

== Overview ==

According to the &quot;MST3K&quot; storyline, Crowlike his fellow robots Tom Servo, Gypsy, and Cambotwas built by Joel Robinson (Joel Hodgson), who created them to help him withstand the torment of watching bad movies on the &quot;Satellite of Love&quot; (SOL). On the &quot;Satellite&quot;, Crow was forced with the rest of the crew to watch horrible retro movies sent by mad scientist Dr. Clayton Forrester and his assistants. In episode 814, &quot;Riding with Death&quot;, Crow describes himself as being made from molybdenum, and in episode 908 Mike piles rocks atop Crow and comments on his &quot;durable molybdenum frame.&quot;

Crow&#x27;s middle initial stands for &quot;The&quot;. In episode #K19: &quot;Hangar 18&quot;, Joel stated that &quot;Crow&quot; was an acronym for &quot;Cybernetic Remotely Operated Woman&quot;, giving Crow a brief identity crisis until Joel revealed he built Crow specifically to play this joke on him. Crow is also sometimes called &quot;Art&quot;, but it is primarily by late-series antagonist Pearl Forrester. This arose from a gag in episode 203 &quot;Jungle Goddess&quot; following a skit centered on the sitcom &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, where Joel referred to Crow as &quot;Art Crow&quot; (in reference to &quot;Honeymooners&quot; co-star Art Carney). After Best Brains received a letter from a child who had evidently missed the cultural reference and labeled a drawing of Crow as &quot;Art&quot; (episode 402, &quot;The Giant Gila Monster&quot;), the show&#x27;s writers turned the name into a recurring joke.

Crow was voiced by Trace Beaulieu from the beginning of the series through the end of season seven, and Bill Corbett from the eighth season until the tenth season. Corbett&#x27;s Crow was noticeably more cynical, irritable, and impatient when viewing the bad movies than Beaulieu&#x27;s Crow had been. Corbett&#x27;s Crow also occasionally appeared more unhinged than Beaulieu&#x27;s incarnation. For example, in episode #902 &quot;The Phantom Planet&quot; Crow dresses as a Solarite (a monster from the movie played by Richard Kiel) and explains: &quot;Have you guys ever noticed how I&#x27;ll see a movie, snap, lose control of myself, and then decide I&#x27;m one of the characters in the movie, and then go out and dress myself up that way?&quot; (Crow having done this before in episode #820 &quot;Space Mutiny&quot; as a &quot;Bellerian&quot;). He is voiced by Hampton Yount in the 2017 series revival.

Crow&#x27;s accomplishments during the show&#x27;s run include:

* Writing several screenplays, including &quot;Earth vs. Soup&quot; (his seminal work) (seen in &quot;Earth vs the Spider&quot;), &quot;Peter Graves at the University of Minnesota&quot; (&quot;Beginning of the End&quot;), &quot;The Spy Who Hugged Me&quot; (&quot;Secret Agent Super Dragon&quot;), &quot;Chocolate Jones and the Temple of Funk&quot; (&quot;Angels Revenge&quot;), and &quot;Crow T. Robot&#x27;s World War Space&quot; (&quot;Starcrash&quot;). He also wrote a rather poorly researched documentary titled &quot;Crow T. Robot&#x27;s Bram Stoker&#x27;s The Civil War&quot;, and created another called &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk Women!&quot;, in which he denies the existence of women (also comparing women to Bigfoot). He also wrote a one man show titled &quot;Robot on the Run&quot;. In the revival series, Crow creates a sitcom with Tom called &quot;Mad Bots&quot;, and later he creates a parody Space Opera title &quot;Crow T. Robot&#x27;s World War Space&quot;.
* Being an avid member of the Kim Cattrall and Estelle Winwood fan clubs.
* Co-writing a satirical musical called &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpiali-wacky!&quot;
* During the Christmas episode #321, &quot;Santa Claus Conquers the Martians&quot;, he wrote a Christmas carol titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Patrick Swayze Christmas&quot;, inspired by his favorite movie, &quot;Road House&quot;.
* Though everyone aboard the SOL would like to escape, the cause is almost always the desire for freedom, not a result of the slew of terrible B-movies. But, in episode #903, &quot;The Pumaman&quot;, Crow actually succumbed to the Mads&#x27; experiment. He decided this film had finally pushed him over the edge and that he could no longer stand watching the movies. He attempted to run away, hoping to find a satellite where he would be forced to watch &quot;good&quot; movies, but gave up on his escape attempt after mere seconds.
* In between segments of the movie &quot;Werewolf&quot;, he unintentionally turns Mike into a &quot;Werecrow.&quot;

In the earlier seasons of the show, he often announced &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, &quot;Topo Gigio&quot;!&quot; in the voice of Ed Sullivan.

During episode 416, &quot;Fire Maidens of Outer Space&quot;, Crow acquired a double named &quot;Timmy&quot;, to whom the trio quickly took a liking. (Timmy was actually portrayed by the black-painted Crow used for the Shadowrama in the theater.) However, the double began playing tricks on Tom Servo and Joel, who blamed Crow for the actions. He eventually joined them in the theater during the movie and attacked Tom, cocooning him in a material identical to the xenomorph in &quot;Alien&quot;, forcing Joel (who referenced &quot;Aliens&quot; by growling, &quot;Let go of him, you bitch!&quot;) and Crow to stuff him into an airlock and blast him out of the ship and into space. Timmy&#x27;s appearance was a parody of the evil twin concept.

Crow holds the distinction of being the only SOL robot to ever visit Deep 13 (although Tom Servo and Gypsy once visited the alternate-earth version and Cambot is directly connected to the Mads&#x27; camera): In episode 615, &quot;Kitten with a Whip&quot;, he slid down the Umbilicus in an attempt to bring the SOL back to Earth, only to be frightened back up by Dr. Forrester (who then had Frank put a giant mousetrap beneath the Umbilicus). In the &quot;Turkey Day&quot; version of episode 701, &quot;Night of the Blood Beast&quot;, Crow attended the Forrester Thanksgiving dinner alongside such guests as Mr. B Natural, Pitch the Devil, and others. During this episode, Crow seems to have a friendship with Pearl Forrester, who seems to enjoy his company and the fact he would listen to her complain about her inept son, Dr. Forrester.

In the theatrical film based on the series, Crow distinguishes himself early on by attempting to tunnel back to Earth using a pickaxe. Even he admits the faulty logic employed in this scheme when he examines his calculations: &quot;Well, look at that! &#x27;Breach hull, all die&#x27;I even had it underlined!&quot; / &quot;Well, believe me, Mike, I calculated the odds of this succeeding versus the odds I was doing something incredibly stupid, and... I went ahead anyway.&quot;

A running joke of Crow&#x27;s character throughout the series, particularly in the last few seasons of the Sci-Fi channel&#x27;s running of the show, is his frequent costume changes into film characters during the host segments. Often Crow has been known to take on the appearance and sometimes the personality of one of the characters in the movie that is currently being shown, usually ending with Mike, Tom Servo, or Joel using Crow&#x27;s role-playing as a plot device or setup to a joke that mocks the film even more. As previously mentioned, this continuing effect finally was recognized by Crow himself during Episode 902, &quot;The Phantom Planet&quot;.

Another recurring joke that was more prominent during the earlier seasons of the seriesdating, in fact, from the KTMA dayswas Crow&#x27;s apparent inability to distinguish between different types of animal; he would joyfully cry &quot;Kitty!&quot; when an animal appeared on screen, regardless of whether it was at all feline, and regardless of whether it was even cute enough to elicit such a positive response.

In &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Comic&quot;, Crow along with the other Bots and Jonah Heston were sent into the comics thanks to Kinga&#x27;s new invention the Bubbulat-R. While Tom Servo was sent into Johnny Jason, Teen Reporter and Jonah was sent into Black Cat, Crow was sent into Horrific but then the effects of the comic started to make Crow succumb a comic disease called four-color fever and turns into a monster called &quot;the Crow-Keeper&quot; which eventually starts to threaten his relationship with Jonah and the other Bots and Kinga&#x27;s plan in conquering comic media.

In the season 13 premiere &quot;Santo in the Treasure of Dracula&quot;, Crow is given the ability to blink by Jonah.

Crow spoke the final line of dialogue when the original series ended in 1999. (&quot;This movie looks kind of familiar doesn&#x27;t it?&quot;; Season 10 episode 13: &quot;Diabolik&quot;)

== Behind the scenes ==

Crow is a gold-colored puppet composed of, among other things, a soap dish eye cowl, ping pong ball eyes, a split plastic bowling pin mouth, a lacrosse face mask webbing (Cooper XL7-FG), and Tupperware panels for the body. The original puppet for Crow was built by Joel Hodgson in a single night before filming the pilot episode. At the beginning of Season One, the puppet was redesigned and built by Trace Beaulieu, adding a second Tupperware tray to Crow&#x27;s torso as well as movable eyes. Another version of Crow is used for the theater segments. This version is painted flat black. Of all the bots, Crow was the least changed from his KTMA incarnation to when the series became nationally broadcast. He is the only one who retained his general primary color.

Trace Beaulieu operated Crow in the initial KTMA season and throughout the Comedy Channel/Comedy Central years of seasons 1–7, as well as in &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie&quot;. During KTMA and season 1, Trace slowly refined Crow&#x27;s voice. Originally, it was somewhat babyish, with a pronounced Minnesota accent. By season two, Crow&#x27;s voice had become more sharp. Upon Trace&#x27;s departure, Brooklyn-raised Bill Corbett took over Crow&#x27;s operation. Corbett jokingly mentioned that during his time alone on the SOL, Crow suffered a stroke, thus explaining the change of his voice and his initially less-than-graceful handling of the puppet.
Despite initial concerns from the fanbase regarding Beaulieu&#x27;s departure, the reception for Corbett&#x27;s performance was very positive and he quickly became a fan favorite. The show&#x27;s writers later made a joke of the change in episode 904, &quot;Werewolf&quot;, by suggesting that Crow&#x27;s inherent characteristics included a change of voice every seven years. When Joel Hodgson returned for a guest spot in episode 1001, &quot;Soultaker&quot;, he offhandedly suggests that Crow &quot;changed his bowling pin&quot; (that is, his mouth). From Season 8 onward, in the opening theme during the &quot;Robot Roll Call&quot;, Crow can be heard exclaiming &quot;I&#x27;m different!&quot;

Many first-time viewers of the series are confused by Crow&#x27;s appearance during the movie segments. Only the outline of his head can be seen, and (due to multistable perception) it can appear as if Crow is facing &quot;toward&quot; the viewer. This phenomenon was addressed in &quot;The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide&quot; with illustrations comparing Crow to a Necker cube.

At Dragon Con in 2009, Beaulieu and Corbett made a joint appearance for a &quot;Crow vs. Crow&quot; panel discussion, in which they discussed their respective work with the character. The discussion is included as a bonus feature on the &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000: Vol. XX&quot; DVD set from Shout! Factory.

For the series revival, a new Crow was built with much larger hands, controlled with arm rods, similar to Kermit the Frog, which makes the puppeteering more complicated, so two puppeteers are dedicated to Crow, with Yount controlling the opening and closing of Crow&#x27;s beak and providing the voice off-camera.

== Appearances in other media ==

* An episode of &quot;Futurama&quot; entitled &quot;Raging Bender&quot; has the gang visiting the theater, where Fry mockingly riffs on a newsreel intro before being shushed by the silhouette of a rather testy Crow-like robot ironically saying &quot;Don&#x27;t talk during the movie!&quot;; beside him is a Tom Servo-resembling robot.
* In the Archie Comics series &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, issue #52, Sonic is sent into a 1920s variation of Mobius. In searching for the handheld computer Nicole, Sonic does battle with a number of robots, three of them resembling Crow T. Robot, Tom Servo and Cambot.
* In an issue of &quot;Star Wars Tales&quot;, Crow and Tom (with his cylinder head) are seen in the foreground of a comedic tale written by Peter David, starring a perky Force-using droid. He also appears in &quot;Tag and Bink: Revenge of the Clone Menace&quot;, along with Tom Servo and Gypsy.
* The June 8 2007 edition of the Cat And Girl comic features Crow as the President of South Vietnam.
*Trace Beaulieu reprised his role of Crow for a brief cameo appearance in two episodes of the fourth season of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, along with Joel.

== Crow Syndrome ==

The &quot;Crow Syndrome&quot; is a frequent joke on the show and MSTings, wherein Crow chimes in with an off-topic and/or excessively lewd comment and the other two reprimand him, often bemusedly and perturbedly shouting &quot;Crow!&quot; in response. &quot;Crow Syndrome&quot; is a general term, and is used in MSTings that do not feature Crow or other regular characters.

<text>Kendal, once Kirkby in Kendal or Kirkby Kendal, is a market town and civil parish in the unitary authority of Westmorland and Furness, England. It lies within the River Kent&#x27;s dale, from which its name is derived, just outside the boundary of the Lake District National Park.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, the area was collected under Yorkshire. The area came under the Honour of Lancaster before the barony split. The town became the Barony of Kendal&#x27;s seat, in 1226/7 this barony merged with the Barony of Westmorland to form the historic county of Westmorland with Appleby as the historic county town. In 1889, Kendal became the county town. Under the 1974 reforms, it became the administrative centre of the South Lakeland district. The town became Westmorland and Furness district&#x27;s administrative centre in a 2023 reform.

It is south-east of Windermere and north of Lancaster. At the 2011 census, the town had a population of 28,586, making it the second largest town in Westmorland and Furness after Barrow-in-Furness. As of the 2021 Census, its population was 29,593. It is renowned today mainly as a centre for shopping, for its festivals and historic sights, including Kendal Castle, and as the home of Kendal Mint Cake. The town&#x27;s grey limestone buildings have earned it the sobriquet &quot;Auld Grey Town&quot;.

==Name==
&quot;Kendal&quot; takes its name from the River Kent (the etymology of whose name is uncertain but thought to be Celtic) and the Old Norse word &quot;dalr&quot; (&quot;valley&quot;). Kendal is listed in the Domesday Book as part of Yorkshire with the name Cherchebi (from Old Norse &quot;kirkju-bý&quot;, &quot;church-village&quot;). For many centuries it was called Kirkby Kendal: &quot;village with a church in the valley of the River Kent&quot;.

==History==
A chartered market town, the centre of Kendal has formed round a high street with alleyways, known locally as yards, off to either side. The main industry in those times was the manufacture of woollen goods, whose importance is reflected in the town&#x27;s coat of arms and in its Latin motto &quot;Pannus mihi panis&quot; (Cloth is my bread.) &quot;Kendal Green&quot; was a hard-wearing, wool-based fabric specific to the local manufacturing process. It was supposedly sported by the Kendalian archers instrumental in the English victory over the French at the Battle of Agincourt. Kendal Green was also worn by slaves in the Americas and appears in songs and literature from that time. Shakespeare notes it as the colour of clothing worn by foresters (&quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;).

Kendal Castle has a long history as a stronghold, built on the site of several successive castles. The earliest was a Norman motte and bailey (located on the west side of the town), when the settlement went under the name of Kirkbie Strickland. The most recent is from the late 12th century, as the castle of the Barony of Kendal, the part of Westmorland ruled from here. The castle is best known as the home of the Parr family, as heirs of these barons. They inherited it through marriage in the reign of Edward III of England. Rumours still circulate that King Henry VIII&#x27;s sixth wife Catherine Parr was born at Kendal Castle, but the evidence available leaves this unlikely: by her time the castle was beyond repair and her father was already based in Blackfriars, London, at the court of King Henry VIII.

===Roman fort===

A Roman fort stood about 2 miles south of today&#x27;s town centre, at a site later known as Watercrook. It was built about AD 90, originally in timber, rebuilt with stone about 130, in the reign of Hadrian. The fort was abandoned for about 20 years during the Antonine re-occupation of Scotland. It was rebuilt in the reign of Marcus Aurelius and occupied until about 270 – probably the last time it served military purposes. What remains of the stone structure is now buried under a field. Many Roman artefacts from the site may be found in the Kendal Museum.

===Transport===
Early travellers to Kendal complained of eight miles of &quot;nothing but a confused mixture of Rockes and Boggs.&quot; Riding horseback was the fastest form of travel, as the road was &quot;no better than the roughest fell tracks on high ground and spongy, miry tracks in the vallies.&quot;

It became clear it was unjust and beyond the power of a thinly scattered rural population to maintain a road used for through traffic. &quot;Whereas the road is very ruinous, and some parts thereof almost impassable and could not, by the ordinary course appointed by the Laws then in being for repairing the highways, be amended and kept in good repair, unless some further provision was made.&quot; In 1703, by Order of the Quarter Sessions of the Barony of Kendall, the surveyors of highways were to make the roads good and sufficient for the passage of coaches, carts and carriages. In 1753 the Keighley and Kendal Turnpike brought a stage coach service from Yorkshire as far as Kendal.

===Mint cake===
Kendal is known for Kendal mint cake, a glucose-based confectionery reputedly discovered accidentally by Joseph Wiper during a search for a clear glacier mint.

Used on numerous expeditions to mountaintops (including Mount Everest and K2) and both poles of the Earth, its popularity is mainly due to the very astute decision of the original manufacturer&#x27;s great-nephew to market it as an energy food and supply it to Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s 1914–1917 Trans-Antarctic Expedition.

By the time the business was sold to a competitor, Romney&#x27;s, in 1987, there were several rival mint-cake producers; some of these businesses are still in business.

===Tobacco and snuff===
Snuff manufacture in Kendal dates from 1792, when Kendalian Thomas Harrison returned from learning its production in Glasgow, Scotland. He brought with him 50 tons of second-hand equipment, all carried on horseback. Pipe tobacco and other tobacco products were added later to the firm&#x27;s production. Ownership of the firm passed to a son-in-law, Samuel Gawith, whose eponymic firm Samuel Gawith &amp; Co. remains in business. After Gawith&#x27;s death in 1865, the firm passed to his two eldest sons, being administered initially by trustees, including Henry Hoggarth, and John Thomas Illingworth.

Illingworth left the firm in 1867 to start his own firm, which remained in business until the 1980s. The youngest son of Samuel Gawith subsequently teamed with Henry Hoggarth to form Gawith Hoggarth TT, Ltd. Both firms continue in business in Kendal, producing snuffs and tobacco products used around the world. Samuel Gawith and Company holds the distinction of employing the oldest piece of industrial equipment still in use in the world: a device manufactured in the 1750s.

===The Kendal Bank===

The Maude, Wilson &amp; Crewdsons Bank was established in &quot;Farrers House&quot;, Stramongate in 1788. Joseph Maude, Christopher Wilson and Thomas Crewdson were the original partners. In 1792 they moved into a specially constructed premises at No 69, Highgate. The Wilson family, who lived at Abbot Hall, withdrew in 1826 at a time of the paper panic of 1825 caused by a run on the banks. Under the style of W D Crewdson &amp; Sons, the remaining family continued until the amalgamation in 1840 with John Wakefield &amp; Sons founded by John Wakefield. The bank was eventually bought out by Barclays.

==Governance==
===Civic history===
The municipal borough of Kendal was created in 1835; until 1894 it was also an urban sanitary district. The borough boundaries were altered in 1935 under a County Review Order to include a patch of South Westmorland Rural District. The civil parishes of Kirkland and Nether Graveship became in 1908 part of Kendal Civil Parish, whose boundaries thereafter were the same as the borough&#x27;s. From 1888 to 1974, Kendal was the centre of the administrative county of Westmorland, although Appleby was the traditional county town.

The borough was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the South Lakeland district of Cumbria. Kendal as a successor parish kept its own town council.

In April 2023, Kendal became the seat of the new Westmorland and Furness council area. The councils of Cumbria and South Lakeland were abolished at the same time.

===Parliament===
Kendal is part of the Westmorland and Lonsdale parliamentary constituency, of which Tim Farron is the current MP, representing the Liberal Democrats.

==Geography==
Kendal stands on the River Kent, and is mostly ringed by low hills: Scout Scar to the west, Potter Fell to the north, and Benson Knott and Helm Hill to the east. To the south the River Kent winds through rolling dairy- and sheep-farming terrain before reaching the sea at Morecambe Bay around Arnside. Although Kendal is near the Lake District National Park, formed in 1951, it does not lie within the park&#x27;s boundaries. Kendal&#x27;s location surrounded by numerous rural villages makes it an important commercial centre for a wide area. It has been dubbed &quot;The Gateway to the Lakes&quot;.

===Climate===
Kendal has a marine west-coast climate, category Cfb on the Köppen Climate Classification. It has moderately warm summers and mild winters with precipitation at all times of year. In July and August the average daily maximum and minimum are respectively. The corresponding ones in January and February are .

==Economy==
Kendal&#x27;s early prosperity was based largely on cloth manufacture. In the 19th century it became a centre for the manufacture of snuff and shoes – the K Shoes company remained a major employer in the town until its factory closed in 2003. There are still several industries based in the town, such as Gilbert Gilkes &amp; Gordon (manufacturers of pumps and turbines), James Cropper paper makers (based in Burneside, who make, at no profit, the paper for the Remembrance poppies for the Royal British Legion), Mardix (switchgear), Lakeland, and Kendal Nutricare, which has a facility for making baby milk in the north of the town. Tourism is now a major employer, but there is also a significant IT and design sector, enabled by increased broadband availability.

On 26 February 2003, Kendal was granted Fairtrade Town status.

==Transport==
Kendal railway station lies on the Windermere Branch Line. Northern Trains provides direct services to Windermere to the north and to Oxenholme and Lancaster to the south, which are both on the West Coast Main Line.

Local routes from the bus station serve destinations such as Ambleside, Barrow-in-Furness, Keswick, Lancaster and Penrith, with most services operated by Stagecoach Cumbria &amp; North Lancashire. Long-distance National Express coaches run to Preston and Birmingham.

Kendal is located about from the M6 motorway. It is bypassed on the west side by the A591 road, linking it to Windermere and Keswick, and by the A590 leading to Barrow. It is also the end point of the A65 road to Kirkby Lonsdale, Skipton and Leeds, and a destination on the A6 road to Penrith. Kendal is signposted off the M6 at junctions 36 (A65, A590), 37 (A684 road), 38 (A685 road) and 39 (A6). A three-mile, £1.9m A591 bypass opened on 29 August 1971.

The Lancaster Canal was built as far as Kendal in 1819, but the northern section was rendered unnavigable by the construction of the M6. Part of this section was drained and filled in to prevent leakage; the course of the canal through Kendal has now been built over. The canal towpath, however, remains as a footpath through the town. A campaign is underway to restore the canal as far as Kendal.

==Education==
The Queen Katherine School, on Appleby Road, is a secondary school with academy status. The school also has a sixth form.

Kirkbie Kendal School, formerly Kendal Grammar School, is a secondary school Business and Enterprise College serving the area. It operates as a foundation school with academy status. Its former pupils include the historian David Starkey.

Kendal College provides further and higher education courses and the training for employers.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Border.

Kendal&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Cumbria on 95.2 FM, Smooth Lake District on 100.1 FM, Heart North West on 103.2 FM; community on-line stations are Lake District Radio and Bay Trust Radio.

The town&#x27;s local newspaper is The Westmorland Gazette.

==Sport==
Kendal Town Football Club plays in the North West Counties Premier Division, with home games at Parkside Road Stadium.

Kendal RUFC plays in the 5th tier of the English rugby union system, with home games at Mint Bridge Stadium, which has a capacity of 3,500.

<text>Hamama (; also known in Byzantine times as &quot;Peleia&quot;) was a Palestinian town of over 5,000 inhabitants that was depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. It was located 24 kilometers north of Gaza. It was continuously inhabited from the Mamluk period (in the 13th century) until 1948.

Its ruins are today in the north of the Israeli city of Ashkelon.

== Etymology ==

Hamama&#x27;s earliest recorded name is &quot;Peleia,&quot; dating to the Roman period. It translates as &quot;dove&quot;, and when the Arabs conquered it through the Rashidun Caliphate in the seventh century, the town received its Arabic name &quot;Hamama&quot; meaning &quot;dove&quot;, reflecting its Byzantine roots.

Underlying Hamama&#x27;s Late Ottoman and British Mandate toponymy, is a limited stratum of pre-Ottoman village names. To this pre-existing stratum, residents added new place names referring in cases to families living in or around the village. The great importance of land as the main means of production in Hamama’s agrarian society, is reflected by many place names relating to the soil and its characteristics.

== History ==
In the fifth century CE, the site consisted of the Byzantine town of &quot;Peleia&quot;.

Remains from the fifth and sixth century CE have been found here, together with Byzantine ceramics. A fragment of a Greek stone inscription was discovered at this site and is currently held at the Louvre in Paris.

Hamama was located near the site of a battle in 1099 between the Crusaders and the Fatimids, resulting in a Crusader victory. Later Hamama passed into Muslim Mamluk hands.

During the Mandate time, the village was visited by inspectors from the Department of Antiquities who noted two mosques. One of these, known as Shaykh Ibrahim Abi Arqub, included marble columns and capitals in the iwan. The eponymous mosque was affiliated with a mujāhid and descendant of ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb.The other mosque, known as Shaykh Hamid, also incorporated marble fragments. Neither of these mosques have survived. Mandatory archaeologists documented a marble slab (0.3x0.95 m) located on the western wall of the mosque of Ibrāhīm Abū ʿArqūb. This slab featured a nine-line Arabic inscription, now unfortunately lost, which was dated to 700 AH/1301 AD, and the content of which remains unrecorded. 

By 1333/4 CE (734 H.) some of the income from the village formed part of a waqf of the tomb (turba) and madrasa of Aqbugha b. Abd Allah in Cairo. In 1432, it is reported that the Mamluk sultan Barsbay passed through the village. In this period, a renowned scholar and preacher at the al-Aqsa Mosque, Ahmad al-Shafi&#x27;i (1406–1465), was born there.

===Ottoman era===
Hamama, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517. In first Ottoman tax register of 1526/7 the village had a population of 31 Muslim households and one bachelor, and it belonged to the &quot;nahiya&quot; of Gaza (Gaza Sanjak). In the tax registers of 1596 it had a population of 84 Muslim households, an estimated 462 persons. The villagers paid taxes on goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 6,800 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf. Its residents came from various places, including the Hauran, and Egypt.

The seventeenth-century traveller al-Nabulsi recorded that the tomb (qabr) of Shaykh Ibrahim Abi Arqub was located in the village, while the Syrian Sufi teacher and traveller Mustafa al-Bakri al-Siddiqi (1688-1748/9) (ar) visited Hamama in the first half of the eighteenth century, after leaving al-Jura.

Marom and Taxel have shown that during the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries, nomadic economic and security pressures led to settlement abandonment around Majdal ‘Asqalān, and the southern coastal plain in general. The population of abandoned villages moved to surviving settlements, while the lands of abandoned settlements continued to be cultivated by neighboring villages. Thus, Hamama absorbed the lands of Ṣandaḥanna, Mi‘ṣaba, and excluded the lands of Bashsha, an exclave of al-Majdal.

Hamama appears on Jacotin&#x27;s map drawn-up during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion in 1799, though its position is interchanged with that of Majdal. In 1838, &quot;Hamameh&quot; was noted as a Muslim village in the Gaza district.

Local administrative restructuring began in the 1860s as tanzimat reforms were implemented at the district level. The construction of the &quot;quarter system&quot;—the partition of village land among groups of families—led to significant economic development, as evidenced by village land usage in the early twentieth century. 

In 1863, the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village, and noted a mosque constructed with ancient materials. The village had a population of &quot;at least eight hundred souls&quot;. He further noted: &quot;The gardens of Hamama are outstandingly fertile. They are divided by living fences of huge cactus pears, and are planted with olive, fig, pomegranate, mulberry and apricot trees. Here and there slender palm trees and broad treetops of sycamore trees rise above them.&quot;

An official Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that &quot;Hamame&quot; had 193 houses and a population of 635, although it only counted the men.

===British Mandate era===
Under the British Mandate in Palestine, a village council was established to administer local affairs, and Hamama had a mosque, and two primary schools for boys and girls established in 1921. British Mandate Ḥamāma had pre-planned new communities erected around the original village nucleus, with crisscrossed pathways separating the new residential quarters. 

In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Hamama had a population of 2,731; 2,722 Muslims and 9 Christians, where all the Christians were Orthodox. The population had increased in the 1931 census to 3,405; 3,401 Muslims and 4 Christians, in a total of 865 houses.


In the 1945 statistics Hamama had a population of 5,070; 5,000 Muslims, 10 Christians and 60 Jews, with a total of 41,366 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 1,356 dunams were used for citrus and bananas, 4,459 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 28,890 for cereals, while 167 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

In the 1940s, British officials paved the road to the village for year-round automobile access. 

In 1946, the boys&#x27; school had an enrollment of 338, and the girls&#x27; school an enrollment of 46. Its inhabitants engaged primarily in fishing and agriculture, cultivating grain, citrus, apricots, almonds, figs, olives, watermelons, and cantaloupes. Due to the existence of sand dunes in the north part of the town, trees were planted on parts of those lands to prevent soil erosion. 

In addition to agriculture, residents practiced animal husbandry which formed was an important source of income for the village. In 1943, they owned 405 heads of cattle, 310 sheep over a year old, 172 goats over a year old, 228 camels, 11 horses, 9 mules, 567 donkey, 2963 fowls, 454 pigeons. 

=== 1948, and aftermath ===
According to reports published by the newspaper &quot;Felesteen&quot;, Hamama was first drawn into the 1948 Arab-Israeli War after a group of workers from the town laboring in the adjacent fields were struck by Jewish residents from Nitzanim on January 22, 1948, leaving fifteen Arabs wounded. Two days later, a unit from Nitzanim opened fire on Hamama residents, killing one, and on February 17, a group of workers waiting for a bus on the road between Isdud and the town were fired upon, wounding two.

It was captured by Israel from the Egyptian Army in the first stage of Operation Yoav on October 28. By then several refugees from nearby towns were in Hamama, most of them, along with many of Hamama&#x27;s residents, fled with the withdrawing Egyptian troops.

At the end of November 1948, Coastal Plain District troops carried out sweeps of the villages around and to the south of Majdal. Hamama was one of the villages named in the orders to the IDF battalions and engineers platoon, that the villagers were to be expelled to Gaza, and the IDF troops were &quot;to prevent their return by destroying their villages.&quot; The path leading to the village was to be mined. The IDF troops were ordered to carry out the operation &quot;with determination, accuracy and energy&quot;. The operation took place on 30 November. The troops found &quot;not a living soul&quot; in Hamama. However, the destruction of the villages was not completed immediately due to the dampness of the houses and the insufficient amount of explosives.

Mohammed Dahlan&#x27;s family is originally from Hamama.

In 1992 it was noted: &quot;No traces of village houses or landmarks remain. The site is overgrown with wild vegetation, including tall grasses, weeds, and bushes. It also contains cactuses. The surrounding land is unused.&quot;

<text>Specialty Records was an American record label founded in Los Angeles in 1945 by Art Rupe. It was known for rhythm and blues, gospel, and early rock and roll, and recorded artists such as Little Richard, Guitar Slim, Percy Mayfield, and Lloyd Price. Rupe established the company under the name Juke Box Records but changed it to Specialty in 1946 when he parted company with a couple of his original partners. Rupe&#x27;s daughter, Beverly, restarted the label in the 1980s.

The major producers for the label were Rupe, Robert &quot;Bumps&quot; Blackwell, Johnny Vincent and J. W. Alexander. Rupe was known for hating the practice of payola, but by 1953, &quot;the only way for Specialty to remain competitive was to pay like everybody else.&quot;

Specialty owned music publishing companies: Venice Music for BMI-licensed songs, and Greenwich Music for ASCAP-licensed songs.

The record label was sold to Fantasy Records in 1991 and is now part of the Concord Music Group. The music publishing unit was sold to Sony/ATV Music Publishing.

<doc id="336447" wikidata="Q5154555" url="?curid=336447" title="Communist Party USA and American labor movement (1937–1950)">
<text>The Communist Party (CP) and its allies played a role in the United States labor movement, particularly in the 1930s and 1940s, but largely wasn&#x27;t successful either in bringing the labor movement around to its agenda or in converting their influence in any particular union into membership gains for the Party. The CP has had only negligible influence in labor since its supporters&#x27; defeat in internal union political battles in the aftermath of World War II and the Congress of Industrial Organizations&#x27;s (CIO) expulsion of unions in which the party held the most influence in 1950. The expelled parties were often raided by stronger unions, and most withered away.

==Historiography==

Scholars disagree why the American union movement never formed a major labor party, and why American workers have never embraced socialist parties. German sociologist Werner Sombart emphasized the absence of socialism. Seymour Martin Lipset compared the US and Canada and asked why Canada had more success; Ira Katznelson looked at weaknesses in the working class, and Kim Voss emphasized early union formations. Others argue that a strain of American exceptionalism made US workers resistant to parties that emphasized class struggle. Some say that Americans downplayed political and social agendas for the sake of unity, so that short-term gains and building strong unions came at the cost of a potential labor party. Others say the left lost its power to lead the labor movement by what commenters charged were &#x27;ideological zig-zags&#x27;. The Communist role within the labor movement support parts of all of these theses.

==Factionalism, zig zags and retreats==
After playing a leading role in the United Automobile Workers&#x27;s (UAW) victories in Flint against General Motors and Chrysler in 1937, the Communist Party found itself under sharp attack from its opponents within the UAW. Homer Martin, first president of the UAW, sought to drive out all of the left activists within the UAW in order to eliminate any rival contenders for power. Martin brought in Jay Lovestone, former executive secretary of the CP before his expulsion in 1929, as his advisor and installed Lovestone supporters in key positions throughout the union.

Martin only succeeded, however, in bringing about his own downfall. After he failed to persuade the UAW Convention in 1937 to give him authority to fire organizers and eliminate local union newspapers, Martin set out to expel his rivals. After firing or transferring a number of CP members who had played prominent roles in the Flint sit-down strike, Martin first suspended, then expelled, Mortimer and his other opponents on the UAW&#x27;s Executive Board. The CIO leadership, alarmed by the possibility that sectarian infighting might destroy the UAW, forced Martin to reinstate the Executive Board members. When the reconstituted Executive Board ordered Martin to sever his ties with Lovestone and to submit all his public announcements to it for its approval, he attempted to suspend the majority of the Board, including both his opponents associated with the CP, such as Mortimer, their allies, such as Richard Frankensteen, and the UAW leaders associated with the Socialist Party, such as Walter Reuther. That nearly split the UAW. After skirmishes at the UAW headquarters and some local unions, the expelled Executive Board members, with the support of the CIO, regained control in 1939 and expelled Martin. He left with about 20,000 members to form his own union, which affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Lovestone left with him.

The CP was in a particularly strong position at that point: it was the leading player in the Left-Center coalition that had defeated Martin and would have been able to elect George Addes, a close ally of the Party, as President of the UAW if it had pressed the point. But that would have required that the Party defy Sidney Hillman, head of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and the most powerful force within the CIO after Lewis, and Philip Murray, Lewis&#x27; protégé and head of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, who came to the convention to demand the selection of R.J. Thomas, an apolitical Board member who had, until recently, supported Martin, as its candidate to end the factional fighting within the UAW.

According to some reports, when Hillman and Murray could not bring Mortimer and his supporters around, Earl Browder, Chairman of the Communist Party of the USA (CPUSA), came to Cleveland to demand that they support Thomas. Eager not to appear as sectarians and thus endanger their role within the CIO at large, the CP leadership had the Communists within the UAW support Thomas and also permit the elimination of the Vice-President positions that they had held. At the same time, the CP began dissolving its factions within the UAW and dropping its shop papers as it aligned itself even more closely with the New Deal. In the name of labor unity, the CP undertook a tactical retreat.

The CP&#x27;s conciliatory stance did not, however, protect it from its other factional rivals within the UAW. The working alliance between the CP and the Socialists in the UAW had broken down in 1938 over differences over the CP&#x27;s support for &quot;collective security&quot;, an alliance of the Soviet Union with the non-fascist nations of the West against Hitler. The Socialist Party, at that time even further left than the CP on many issues, organized a separate caucus within the Executive Board that, from that point forward, opposed the CP and its alliance partners.

===Break with the Roosevelt administration===
The CP made it easier for its opponents by making a number of sudden and shocking changes in policy. After the Hitler-Stalin pact, the CP campaigned vigorously against any US involvement in the war against fascism; a journalist with the CP&#x27;s Weekly Worker newspaper coined the slogan &quot;The Yanks Ain&#x27;t Coming&quot; to sum up the Party&#x27;s position. What is more, the CP now repudiated its Popular Front strategies of the previous four years, attacking President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s administration&#x27;s efforts to support France and Britain against Germany as a campaign to lead the US into an imperialist war. The federal government responded by arresting Earl Browder and a number of other CP leaders.

The CP&#x27;s opponents within the labor movement capitalized on the Party&#x27;s break with FDR to attack it. James Carey, the president of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (or UE) who had worked closely with Communist UE officials in the past, now distanced himself from them over their opposition to a third term for Roosevelt. The UAW passed several resolutions condemning both Nazis and Communists at its Conventions.

At the same time that their break with Roosevelt isolated them within the CIO, opponents of the CP outside the labor movement stepped up their attacks on the loyalty of Party members, accusing them, among other things, of engaging in sabotage by supporting strikes of aircraft workers during the UAW&#x27;s organizing drive in that industry. While some of these accusations, such as those made by the Dies Committee or Reader&#x27;s Digest, were so wide of the mark as to discredit the accusers, the tide of unfavorable publicity made any association with the CP that much riskier.

The CP also lost ground within the CIO. While the CP believed it could shelter itself within the CIO by continuing to loyally support Lewis, who also opposed a third term for Roosevelt, that reliance on Lewis was misplaced. Lewis was prepared both to use the CP and to get rid of CP members when they no longer served his purposes, as demonstrated by the activities of his lieutenant, Adolph Germer, who actively undercut the CP leadership within the International Woodworkers of America when sent to assist it in organizing lumber workers in the Northwest in 1940. At the same time Lewis abolished the position of west coast director of the CIO, which Harry Bridges had held, limiting his authority to California.

Whatever protection the CP could have hoped to receive from Lewis evaporated in any event in 1940, when Lewis abruptly resigned from his position as President of the CIO following his baffling decision to support Wendell Willkie over Roosevelt for President that year. Philip Murray, Lewis&#x27; successor as head of the CIO, was determined to stop the spread of the CP&#x27;s influence in the CIO and to demonstrate to the public at large that the CIO was not controlled by the CP. To that end he insisted on a resolution at the CIO&#x27;s 1940 conference that condemned Communism, along with Nazism and fascism, as &quot;inimical to the welfare of labor.&quot; Lee Pressman, the most highly placed CP ally within the CIO, presented the resolution in his role as secretary of the resolutions committee.

Murray did not, however, insist on banning Communists from the CIO; on the contrary, he had no desire to provoke a public fight over the CP&#x27;s politics or CP members&#x27; role within either the CIO or its affiliates. This suited the Party, which likewise did not want to risk a showdown that could possibly result in either their expulsion or split the CIO. So while internal political disputes kept the battles raging within unions such as the UAW, the UE and the IWA, the CP agreed to a compromise that forced them to accept the label of &quot;totalitarian,&quot; but allowed them to maintain their positions within the CIO itself.

Communist influence in labor unions was seen by the Roosevelt administration as a serious threat to US military preparedness. As the US military built up in 1940 and 1941, US Secretary of War Henry Stimson was convinced that labor strikes and slowdowns at key facilities were due to the CPUSA&#x27;s efforts to block Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s military preparedness policy. Strikes at Harville Die-Casting Company, Alcoa, and North American Aviation were widely seen within the Roosevelt administration as communist-inspired for ideological reasons, rather than for better wages and working conditions. The most important strike seen as communist-inspired was at the North American Aviation aircraft plant in Los Angeles on 5 June 1941. The plant built bombers for the U. S. and British governments, and the strike was seen as a serious threat to American aid to the Allies. The federal government seized the plant and army troops forced open paths through the picket lines to allow workers to enter the plant.

==World War II and the no-strike pledge==

The CP&#x27;s policy toward President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and war changed as soon as Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. At that point, the CP changed into unqualified supporters for the war effort. For their labor allies, that meant not only unconditional support for a wartime no-strike pledge - which the rest of the labor movement had endorsed to some degree - but also opposition to anything that would compromise anti-fascist unity at home. The CP&#x27;s opponents within the labor movement would also use CP&#x27;s sudden change against them in the factional battles of the years to come.

The change in CP policy led to some startlingly inconsistent positions on its part. When A. Philip Randolph, President of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and the foremost African-American unionist of the time, urged a march on Washington in 1941 to underscore black workers&#x27; demands for the elimination of job discrimination in war industries, the CP attacked him relentlessly. This is more than ironic: the CP had championed black workers&#x27; rights in the past, even when it complicated their efforts to organize textile workers or miners in the South.

The Party had, however, strong political differences with Randolph, even before it became a supporter of the war: he had resigned as head of the National Negro Congress and denounced the CP when the CP broke with the Roosevelt Administration. When Hitler attacked the Soviet Union it continued to attack Randolph&#x27;s proposed March, but now on the ground that it undermined the unity needed to win the war. The CP did not, on the other hand, abandon its support for civil rights, supporting the creation of the Fair Employment Practices Committee and fighting for equal treatment of black workers in the unions in which they had a presence. These battles were particularly fierce within the UAW, many of whose white members had engaged in hate strikes to protest either the hiring or promotion of black workers in their plants and who had engaged in the massive race riots in Detroit in 1943.

That battle inevitably became part of the larger battle between the Addes and Frankensteen group within the UAW, which the CP supported, and the Walter Reuther-led opposition. While each faction supported creation of a &#x27;minority department&#x27; within the UAW to deal with the special needs of black and other minority workers and the education of UAW members generally, they disagreed over whether the head of that department should always be African-American. In the end, the 1943 UAW Convention defeated both sides&#x27; proposals on a voice vote after a heated debate in which many delegates opposed taking any stand on civil rights as being outside the union&#x27;s economic sphere.

The CP was more vocal and consistent in supporting the wartime no-strike pledge - a position that ultimately cost it much support within the labor movement. The CIO and the AFL each supported the pledge in general, particularly after the furor strikes in the aircraft industry and at Allis-Chalmers Company had provoked in the years immediately before the United States&#x27; entry into the war. But the CP and its allies now embraced the pledge with such fervor, at the expense of traditional union principles some said, that it made the Party&#x27;s commitment to unionism suspect. Harry Bridges of the International Longshore Workers Union (ILWU) called for a speedup of the pace of work - which may not have been inconsistent with the union&#x27;s goal of controlling the way that work was done on the docks - but certainly sounded strange coming from the union that had previous relentlessly fought employers on the issue. Bridges, Joseph Curran of the NMU and Julius Emspak of the UE even supported a proposal by Roosevelt in 1944 to militarize some civilian workplaces, but retreated when the rest of the CIO executive board reacted furiously against it.

The CP also supported piecework systems in the electrical and automobile industries, which it defended as both necessary to boost production and a way to improve workers&#x27; earnings under the wartime wage control systems imposed by the War Labor Board, but which were still anathema, particularly to unionists in mass production industries such as automobile manufacturing. Walter Reuther used this issue to great effect against the CP and its allies at the UAW&#x27;s 1943 Convention, where his slate fell just short of defeating Addes and Frankensteen.

On the other hand, the CP mended fences with Sidney Hillman and others within the CIO leadership by coming out strongly in support of Roosevelt for the duration of the war and working diligently in the CIO&#x27;s political efforts. The Party also grew tremendously during the war years and even took the step, in the wake of the formal alliance between the United States and the Soviet Union, to formally dissolve itself, or at least rename itself as the Communist Political Association in 1944.

That attempt to submerge itself in the broader coalition to support Roosevelt and the Soviet Union probably did more to damage the Party&#x27;s standing with many of its most reliable supporters than to make it look safe or respectable to people outside the Party. The Comintern changed direction a year later, when it ejected Browder from the Party, reestablished the CPUSA and installed Foster as its Chairman.

==The post-war era and expulsion from the CIO==

The CP suffered a series of setbacks in the immediate postwar era. The most serious was their complete rout in the UAW, where Walter Reuther&#x27;s slate finally triumphed in 1947 after years of inconclusive struggles with the Addes and Frankensteen faction. Reuther subsequently drove all of his principal CP adversaries out of the UAW, using one of the provisions of the newly enacted Taft–Hartley Act to complete the process.

In 1946 the Republican Party took control of both the House and Senate. That Congress passed the Taft–Hartley Act, which, among other things, required all union officers to sign an affidavit that they were not Communists in order for the union to bring a case before the NLRB. Reuther had three of the CP-leaning leaders of UAW Local 248 in Milwaukee—one of the CP&#x27;s bastions and including some of Reuther&#x27;s bitterest enemies—expelled for their refusal to sign the oath.

The CIO itself was slower to join the purge. Persons associated with the CP did, in fact, exercise a good deal of influence in a number of CIO unions in the 1940s, both in the leadership of unions such as the ILWU, UE, Transport Workers Union of America and Fur and Leather Workers and in staff positions in a number of other unions. Those persons had an uneasy relationship with Murray while he headed the CIO. He mistrusted the radicalism of some of their positions and was innately far more sympathetic to anti-Communist organizations such as the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists. He also believed, however, that making anti-Communism a crusade would only strengthen labor&#x27;s enemies and the rival AFL at a time when labor unity was most important.

Murray might have let the status quo continue, even while Reuther and others within the CIO attacked Communists in their unions, if the CPUSA had not chosen to back Henry A. Wallace&#x27;s third party campaign for President in 1948. That, and an increasingly bitter division over whether the CIO should support the Marshall Plan, brought Murray to the conclusion that peaceful co-existence with Communists within the CIO was impossible.

Murray began by removing Bridges from his position as the California Regional Director for the CIO and letting go first Len De Caux in late 1947 and Lee Pressman in early 1948. Anti-communist unionists then took the battle to the City and State Councils, where they attempted to oust Communist leaders who did not support the CIO&#x27;s position on the Marshall Plan and Wallace. A number of former allies or members of the Party, including Mike Quill of the Transport Workers and Joseph Curran of the National Maritime Union, severed their ties with the CP and fired the CP members on their staffs during this time.

After the 1948 election, the CIO took the fight one step further in 1950, expelling the ILWU, the Mine, Mill &amp; Smelter Workers Union, the Farm Equipment Union, the Food and Tobacco Workers, and the Fur and Leather Workers, while creating a new union, the International Union of Electrical Workers, to replace the UE, which left the CIO rather than purge its leadership. The CP, which once held positions of influence at every level within the CIO and many of its affiliates, was now driven out of the CIO.

==The years since==

The CP has, for all effects and purposes, no presence in or influence on the American union movement. Some of the expelled unions, such as the ILWU and UE, survived outside the AFL-CIO, maintaining their political principles, in particular solidarity with labor&#x27;s struggles around the world and greater rank-and-file control of the union, but have no political relationship with the CP and only marginal influence within the labor movement as a whole. The ILWU has since reaffiliated with the AFL-CIO. Others, such as Mine, Mill, survived; it later merged with its ideological opponent, the Steelworkers, just as the Farm Equipment union eventually was absorbed by the UAW with the latter adding &quot;Farm Implement Workers&quot; to their long official name. Others, such as the Food and Tobacco Workers, disappeared.

To the extent that the CP has had any residual effect on the American union movement, after helping to organize some industrial unions, its only legacy has been its opposition to racial discrimination and its commitment to organizing the lowest-paid workers. &quot;Old left&quot; unionists played an important role in organizing hospital workers into District 1199 in New York in the 1950s and 1960s; CP veterans also contributed to the organizing successes of the United Farm Workers. But by the 1950s and 1960s, present and former members of the CPUSA did not advertise their membership or try to use organizing victories to recruit new members. The Party by that time was too weak, membership having declined fairly continuously since early in the Eisenhower (and McCarthy) era.

<text>Greek National Road 9 (, abbreviated as EO9) is a single carriageway with at-grade intersections in the West Greece and Peloponnese regions. It runs along the west coast of the Peloponnese peninsula, from Patras to Methoni via Pyrgos. Its length is around , making it the second-longest national highway of Greece.

The government of Greece plans to replace the road by a new motorway. This will be a southern extension of the A5 (Ionia Odos), which will connect the Albanian border near Ioannina with the A7 (Moreas) north of Kalamata. It is expected to be completed in 2015.

==Route==

The EO9 is officially defined as a coastal route through the Achaea, Elis and Messenia regional units of the Peloponnese, running between Patras to the north and Methoni to the south, via Kato Achaia, Pyrgos, Kyparissia and Pylos. The EO9 forms part of the European route E55 from Mintilogli – where the A5 motorway currently ends – to Kalo Nero.

==History==

Ministerial Decision G25871 of 9 July 1963 created the EO9 from the old EO51, which existed by royal decree from 1955 to 1963, and also followed the same route as the current EO9. In 1998, the Hellenic Statistical Authority created the EO9a as a branch of the EO9, from Kalo Nero to , taking over some of the Messenia regional unit&#x27;s Provincial Roads.

<text>Lakeside is a village in Newby Bridge at the south end of Windermere, England. Now in the county of Cumbria, before county reorganisation of 1974 it was in Lancashire, as part of the region known as Furness. It was established as a steamer pier for services along the lake when the Lakeside branch of the Furness Railway reached it in 1869, meaning that steamer services no longer had to negotiate the River Leven to Newby Bridge. Also built at Lakeside was a hotel to serve the tourists brought by the railway and steamers.

The steamers still call at Lakeside and the railway is now a steam-hauled heritage railway, operated as the Lakeside &amp; Haverthwaite Railway. However, it now only operates as far as Haverthwaite, with the route beyond to Ulverston closed in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts.

It now contains the Aquarium of the Lakes, an aquarium featuring fish found in the rivers and seas around the Lake District.

In November 2009, the village including Lakeside Hotel and the Lakes Aquarium was partially flooded. The floods resulted in the closure of both businesses until early 2010 as well as the sinking of moored yachts and severe road blockages.

<doc id="336451" wikidata="Q1451327" url="?curid=336451" title="Fraser spiral illusion">
<text>The Fraser spiral illusion is an optical illusion that was first described by the British psychologist Sir James Fraser (1863–1936) in 1908.

The illusion is also known as the false spiral, or by its original name, the twisted cord illusion. The overlapping black arc segments appear to form a spiral; however, the arcs are a series of concentric circles.

The visual distortion is produced by combining a regular line pattern (the circles) with misaligned parts (the differently colored strands). Zöllner&#x27;s illusion and the café wall illusion are based on a similar principle, like many other visual effects, in which a sequence of tilted elements causes the eye to perceive phantom twists and deviations.

The illusion is augmented by the spiral components in the checkered background. It is a unique illusion, where the observer can verify the concentric strands manually. When the strands are highlighted in a different colour, it becomes obvious to the observer that no spiral is present.

<text>The 84th &quot;Givati&quot; Brigade () is an Israel Defense Forces infantry brigade formed in 1947.

During the 1948 war, it was involved in capturing Palestinian villages in operations &quot;Hametz&quot;, &quot;Barak&quot;, and &quot;Pleshet&quot;.

Before Israel&#x27;s 2005 withdrawal from Gaza, the Brigade was stationed within the Gaza Strip.

Givati soldiers are designated by purple berets. The Brigade&#x27;s symbol is the fox, alluding to Shualei Shimshon (שועלי שמשון, &quot;lit.&quot; &quot;Samson&#x27;s Foxes&quot;), a unit in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

** Signals Company &quot;Maor/myrrh&quot;
==History==

Givati was formed in December 1947 and placed under the command of Shimon Avidan. At the start of the 1948 Palestine war, the brigade was charged with operations in the central region of Israel, participating in operations &quot;Hametz&quot;, &quot;Barak&quot; and &quot;Pleshet&quot;. During Operation Barak, the brigade perpetrated a massacre in the village of Abu Shusha, killing around 60 residents. As the war entered its second stage, Givati became the 5th Brigade, was moved to the south, and concentrated mainly around Gedera, Gan Yavne and Be&#x27;er Tuvia. One battalion fought on the Jerusalem front, participating in Operation Nachshon and the Battles of Latrun.

When Israel declared independence, Givati consisted of 5 battalions, with notable commanders such as Jehuda Wallach (51st Battalion), Ya&#x27;akov Pri (52nd Battalion), Yitzhak Pundak (53rd Battalion), Tzvi Tzur (54th Battalion) and Eitan Livni (55th Battalion). A sixth battalion (the 57th) was founded on May 30, 1948 from Irgun veterans, in preparation for Operation Pleshet. The brigade or parts thereof subsequently participated in the Battle of Nitzanim, Operation An-Far, Operation Yoav, etc. It was converted into a reserve brigade in 1956 and its 51st &quot;HaBokim HaRishonim&quot; infantry battalion transferred to the Golani Brigade.

===1980s===
Givati was reestablished as a mechanized infantry brigade and then proceeded on to amphibious warfare in 1983. At the time it was intended that the Brigade serve as marines, but this has not been effected. In 1986 the brigade&#x27;s purple beret was officially approved. Since 1999 it serves under Israel&#x27;s Southern Command.

===2002–2003===
The Givati Brigade served under the Southern Command and was deployed in the Gaza Strip. The brigade was awarded a medal of honor for its service in the Gaza Strip during the last two years of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, when under the command of Imad Fares. Under Fares&#x27; command, Givati carried out thousands of operations in the Gaza Strip.

===2004===
The brigade continued its operations in the Gaza Strip under the command of Eyal Eisenberg and the new head of Southern Command, Dan Harel. Givati&#x27;s Recon Battalion, the &quot;Dolev&quot; combat engineering platoon and the Bedouin scouts battalion, won a &quot;recommendation of honor&quot;, mainly for their activities against Rafah&#x27;s tunnels. Givati forces, combined with a special combat engineering tunnels unit, and IDF Caterpillar D9 armoured bulldozers, managed to suppress most of Rafah&#x27;s tunnels.

On May 11 and May 12, 2004, two armored personnel carriers of Givati&#x27;s &quot;Dolev&quot; engineering battalion were destroyed by Palestinian militants. The two separate skirmishes, in Gaza City&#x27;s Zeitoun neighbourhood and the Philadelphi Route near Rafah and the Egyptian border, claimed the lives of 11 soldiers. Islamic Jihad militants captured some of the remains, causing outrage in Israel. Following international pressure and further Israeli operations in Zeitoun, the bodies of soldiers were returned to Israel.

In the Zeitoun incident, UNRWA ambulances were used as transport by healthy Palestinian militants. In an interview with Haaretz, Israel&#x27;s Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz also said that UNRWA&#x27;s ambulances were used by Palestinian militants in order to bring some of the remains of IDF soldiers killed in Zaitoun neighbourhood in Gaza on May 11, 2004. UNRWA has described the May 11 incident as a hijacking.

After two more soldiers were killed in Rafah, Israel launched Operation Rainbow. This involved Givati forces reinforced by Golani Brigade soldiers with IDF Achzarit HAPCs, a battalion of officers from the class-commanders school and several IDF Caterpillar D9 armoured bulldozers. The stated aim of Operation Rainbow was to destroy the terror infrastructure of Rafah, destroy smuggling tunnels and stop illegal missile shipment.

The brigade&#x27;s &quot;Shaked&quot; battalion, under the command of a Lt. Col. &quot;Ofer&quot; (surname not publicized) was rocked by scandals in the second half of 2004 while stationed in the southern Gaza Strip. Two of the battalion&#x27;s four company commanders were removed, although one was later exonerated. Captain &quot;R&quot;, a Druze officer was tried for killing Iman al-Hams, a 13-year-old Palestinian girl, in Rafah in October 2004. Captain &quot;R&quot; was acquitted of all charges by a military court. Another officer, Captain &quot;N&quot;, was removed after Palestinian gunmen infiltrated the Morag settlement and killed three soldiers in September 2004.

===2005===
On September 12, the Givati Brigade left the Gaza Strip as part of Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan, one month after the forceful removal of approximately 8,000 Jewish settlers living in 22 communities in the Strip. It marked an end to the 38 year IDF presence in the Gaza Strip. Today, two battalions are stationed outside the Strip, while the third battalion is positioned on the northern border.

===2006===
On June 27, in response to Hamas&#x27; kidnapping of Corporal Gilad Shalit, the IDF started an offensive in the Gaza Strip to repel the continuous rockets being fired into the Israeli town outside of Gaza and to pressure Hamas to release Shalit. Givati, together with the Golani Brigade, Engineering Corps and the Armored Corps, participated in Operation &quot;Summer Rains.&quot; However, Israel failed to achieve the release of Shalit, and a November 26 ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Palestinian groups forced Israel to withdraw its forces.

Captain &quot;R&quot;, the former Misayat Shaked company commander who was accused in &quot;confirming kill&quot; of 13-year-old Iman al-Hams in Rafah in October 2004, and was acquitted in court, received NIS 80,000 in compensation from the state, according to a December 14 Ha&#x27;aretz report.

Givati was the first brigade to receive the new IMI Tavor TAR-21 assault rifle, in August 2006.

===2007===
As of 2007, the Givati brigade is organized into three main battalions: Shaked, Tzabar, and Rotem, in addition to associated reconnaissance, engineering, and other units.

===2008===
The Givati Brigade participated in Operation Hot Winter.
It also participated in the ground phase of Operation Cast Lead, when of all IDF brigades, it penetrated deepest into Gaza City. The brigade&#x27;s reconnaissance battalion entered the Tel el-Hawa neighborhood in search of Hamas operatives two days before the cease fire went into effect. An estimated 40 Palestinian operatives were killed as dozens of apartments were swept. Hamas reportedly decided to fire the commander of the Gaza City Brigade after its forces fought against Givati.

===2012===

In November 2012, the Givati Brigade participated in Operation Pillar of Defense.

===2014===
In the summer of 2014, the Givati Brigade participated in the Israeli offensive Operation Protective Edge. During a 72-hour ceasefire, elements of the brigade&#x27;s reconnaissance company engaged in a brief skirmish with Hamas militants in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, near the border with Egypt. Three soldiers, including the commander, Benaya Sarel, of the Givati Reconnaissance Company (Sayeret Givati), were killed in the ensuing firefight subsequently dubbed &quot;Black Friday.&quot; Lieutenant Hadar Goldin was captured by Hamas militants and taken into a tunnel, and the assistant company commander took a small group of soldiers with him into the tunnel in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to rescue Goldin.

After learning of Goldin&#x27;s capture, the IDF initiated the Hannibal Directive and carried out a relentless air and ground attack on residential areas of Rafah. In the summer of 2015, a United Nations independent commission inquiry, as well as a joint report by Amnesty International and Forensic Architecture, found that Israel&#x27;s indiscriminate violence against all human life on Black Friday amounted to war crimes. The reports detail the massive Israeli bombardment that killed between 135 and 200 Palestinian civilians, including 75 children.

The IDF Rabbinate later declared Goldin deceased for the purposes of Jewish burial and grieving rituals and buried the remains. The assistant company commander was later awarded Israel&#x27;s highest military honor, and the soldiers that accompanied him into the tunnel were also awarded military commendations. The Givati Brigade was the most highly decorated brigade in the IDF in 2014.

===2015===
In January 2015, a convoy belonging to the Tsabar Battalion of the Givati Brigade was attacked by Hezbollah in Shebaa Farms.

===2022===
In November 2022, the Givati Brigade was involved in &quot;a series of incidents&quot; of alleged abuses towards civilians in Jerusalem and the West Bank. Within the space of a few weeks, Givati Brigade soldiers were accused of spitting at an Armenian Christian archbishop leading a pilgrimage (two soldiers were detained by police), beating Israeli human rights activists in Hebron (two soldiers were suspended), and assaulting a Palestinian man (three soldiers were suspended). While IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi contended that &quot;Incidents such as these tarnish the unit in which the soldier serves, the IDF and the State of Israel,&quot; Israeli MK and national security minister-designate Itamar Ben-Gvir urged the IDF to &quot;think twice&quot; about whether to punish the soldiers, questioning whether they had been &quot;provoked&quot; and contending that disciplining them &quot;weakens the hands of the soldiers and does not strengthen them in the fight against terrorism&quot;.

===2023===
The Givati Brigade has lost 86 soldiers and commanders during the war, including on the October 7, 2023, onslaught.

<text>States Record Company was a Chicago-based record label. A subsidiary of United Recording, it was in business from May 1952 to December 1957. States focused on rhythm and blues, jazz, and gospel.

States was operated by Leonard Allen and Lew Simpkins until Simpkins&#x27; death in April 1953; thereafter, Allen was solely responsible for the company.

Most sessions for States were done at Universal Recording, with high-fidelity results.

The most important blues artist to record for States was Junior Wells, making his debut as a leader; he cut sessions for the company in 1953 and 1954. In the down-home category, Allen also released singles by Robert Nighthawk and Big Walter Horton, as well as pianist Eddie Ware, guitarist L. C. McKinley, and drummer James Bannister. Standup blues singers to record for the label included Edward &quot;The Great Gates&quot; White (accompanied on his outing by Tom Archia and Red Saunders), Cliff Butler, Arbee Stidham, Jack Cooley, and Harold Burrage.

States issued juke-box jazz sides by tenor saxophonists Paul Bascomb, Jimmy Coe, and Cozy Eggleston. A few forays into the Detroit scene produced rhythm and blues by Sax Kari, Jimmy Hamilton, T. J. Fowler, and Helen Thompson. States became involved in doo-wop in 1953 when Allen recorded The Hornets. He soon added The Danderliers, the Five Chances, The Strollers and The Palms.

The vocal groups were rehearsed by Al Smith, who also led studio bands featuring such performers as guitarist Lefty Bates, tenor saxophonist Red Holloway, and drummer Vernel Fournier. In gospel, The Caravans were a mainstay of the label throughout its existence. Eventually, Allen added the Genesa Smith Singers and the Lucy Smith Singers.

Allen did less recording after 1954, and closed both of his labels around the end of 1957. States releases ran consecutively from 101 to 164, for a total of 64 singles on the label.

States relied heavily on The Caravans, releasing 14 singles on them and compiling many more unissued tracks. After the company closed, Savoy Records, which had signed the group and was seeking to consolidate its position in gospel music, bought this rich cache of material. States&#x27; remaining output was acquired in 1975 by Bob Koester of Delmark Records, and has been included in comprehensive reissue programs.

<text>Kawkaba (), known to the Crusaders as Coquebel, was a Palestinian Arab village that was occupied by Israel during Operation Yoav during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and depopulated.

==Location==
The village was on an uneven stretch of red-brown soil on the southern coastal plain. It lay on the highway constructed by the British during World War II, which paralleled the coastal highway.

==History==
The site was known during the Crusades as Coquebel. Kawkaba contained an archaeological site with a pool, cisterns, the foundations of buildings, columns, severed capitals. North of it was Khirbat Kamas, which was identified as the Crusader Camsa and which yielded some archaeological artifacts.

===Ottoman era===
Kawkaba was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with the rest of Palestine, and by 1596 tax record it was known as &quot;Kawkab&quot;, with a population of 16 Muslim households; an estimated 88 persons. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33.3% on a number of crops, including wheat, barley, sesame, fruit trees and vineyards; a total of 2,640 akçe. 6/24 of the revenue went to a waqf.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the area of Kawkaba experienced a significant process of settlement decline due to nomadic pressures on local communities. The residents of abandoned villages moved to surviving settlements, but the land continued to be cultivated by neighboring villages.

In 1838, Edward Robinson noted &quot;Kaukaba&quot; as a Muslim village, located in the Gaza district.

In 1863 Victor Guérin found that the village has a population of five hundred inhabitants. In the interior of a oualy dedicated to &quot;Sheikh Mohammed&quot; he observed mutilated fluted white marble column, next to a Corinthian capital. At the well, he noted two barrels, also ancient columns, one with white marble, the second gray granite, which were, he thought, exhumed in that area and did not come from elsewhere.

An Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed &quot;Kokabe&quot; with a population of 72, in 20 houses, though the population count included men, only. 

In 1882, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described it as a small adobe village, with a well to the west and a pool to the north. The village had a rectangular layout along the above-mentioned road, and expanded north–south alongside it.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;Kukaba&quot; had a population of 439, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 522, still all Muslims, in 121 houses.


Kawkaba shared an elementary school with the villages of Bayt Tima and Hulayqat. Its houses were made of adobe and cement, and its shops were located at the village center, on the western side of the road. On its eastern site were two water sources: a spring and a 70-meter deep well. The villagers engaged in rainfed agriculture, cultivating grain and winter and summer vegetables. Towards the end of the British Mandate period they also cultivated fruits, such as figs and grapes, on all their land expect to the west.

In the 1945 statistics the population of &quot;Kaukaba&quot; was 680 Muslims, while the total land area was 8,542 dunams, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, a total of 166 dunams were used for plantations and irrigable land, 8,166 for cereals, while 40 dunams were built-up areas.

===1948 and after===
The village that was captured by Israel during Operation Yoav during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The fall of the village was preceded by the events at nearby Burayr; where the Haganah Oded Brigade apparently executed a large number of military age Palestinians. The Kawkaba villages had offered to surrender to the Yishuv&#x27;s forces but the Haganah drove out the last of the inhabitants on the 27/28 May 1948. The village was on the front line between the Israeli and Egyptian armies through the summer of 1948 and appears to have changed hands several times.

Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel and in 1950 the moshav of Kokhav Michael was founded on village land, southeast of the village site.

According to Khalidi, by 1992 the remaining structures on the village land were: 
&quot;The site is overgrown with sycamore and Christ&#x27;s -thorn trees. The old road, as well as crumbled walls and debris in a wooded part of the site are clearly visible. The land in the vicinity is cultivated by Israeli farmers.&quot;

==People from Kawkaba==
* The family of Mohammed Deif lived in Kawkaba before the 1948 war.

<text>Shimon Avidan (; February 7, 1911 – September 11, 1994), born Siegbert Koch (), was a Palmach soldier and IDF military leader. He was the commander of the Givati Brigade during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Shimon Avidan was born in Germany in 1911 as Siegbert Koch, to a family of merchants. In his youth, he joined the Communist Party of Germany, which infiltrated him as an undercover agent into the Nazi Party. After the Nazis&#x27; rise to power, Communist Party documents fell into Nazi hands, and the Communist Party recommended that he leave Germany. Shimon fled to France, where he and his brother joined the Hashomer Hatzair movement. In June 1934, at the age of 23, he made Aliyah to Mandatory Palestine during the Fifth Aliyah. He joined Kibbutz Ayelet Hashachar, where he worked as a field guard. He served as a sergeant in the Notrim (Jewish police force) and later became a commander in the Mobile Guard. He then served as the commander of Field Companies in the Upper Galilee and as a fighter and commander in the Special Night Squads established by Captain Orde Charles Wingate. In 1939, he moved to Kibbutz Ein Hashofet, where he lived until his death.

=== Commander of the German Platoon ===

During World War II, in 1941, Avidan was among the first to enlist in the Palmach and became a close friend of Palmach commander Yitzhak Sadeh. During the Two Hundred Days of Dread, from the spring of 1942 until the British Army&#x27;s victory in the Second Battle of El Alamein, Yitzhak Sadeh ordered the formation of the German Platoon of the Palmach, which was intended to carry out guerrilla operations behind enemy lines if Palestine were to fall to the German army. The platoon was established in May 1942, during a time when there was fear in the Yishuv that Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps, advancing through North Africa towards Egypt, might cross the Suez Canal and invade Palestine. The platoon was formed in coordination with the British military command. Avidan, a native German speaker familiar with the German way of life, was appointed its commander, with Yehuda Ben-Hurin (Briger) as his deputy. The platoon trained in the use of weapons, combat tactics, reconnaissance, hand-to-hand combat, and radio communications.

After the British victory in the Second Battle of El Alamein on November 3, 1942, the threat of a German invasion of Palestine receded, and the platoon’s original mission of conducting guerrilla operations in Palestine was no longer necessary. The platoon continued to exist, and rumors occasionally circulated about potential operations it would carry out on various fronts, but none materialized.

Once it became clear that the British army did not require the platoon’s assistance on any front, the platoon was disbanded, and its members were distributed among various Palmach units. Avidan was tasked with forming Palmach Company Z, which was made up of soldiers from the German Platoon, the Balkan Platoon (trained to fight behind enemy lines in the Balkan states), the Arab Platoon (today’s equivalent of the undercover unit known as Mista&#x27;arvim), and the Air Platoon. Avidan became the commander of the company, and one of its section leaders was Yitzhak Rabin.

=== Activities in 1944–1945 ===
Towards the end of World War II, Avidan traveled to Europe on a mission for Mossad LeAliyah Bet, where he became one of the organizers of the Aliyah Bet (illegal Jewish immigration). While in Europe, he led the group known as the Nokmim (Nazi Hunters), which operated under a veil of secrecy that remained mostly intact for years afterward, carrying out the assassination of Nazi war criminals. Upon his return to Palestine, he was appointed commander of the Fourth Battalion of the Palmach.

In late 1944, Avidan was appointed to the headquarters of the Season (Saison), led by Yigal Allon. Before the Season began, discussions were held regarding the moral dilemma of imposing the authority of the Yishuv leadership on the Irgun and Lehi underground movements, which did not recognize its leadership, and the question of whether to turn over Jews to the British. Yigal Allon opposed the handover, but Palmach commander Yitzhak Sadeh strongly supported carrying out the Saison. Avidan&#x27;s view was that it was preferable to act against the underground movements independently, without cooperating with the British, but if the choice was between cooperation with the British or inaction, then cooperation with the British was the better option.

Several weeks before the end of World War II, Avidan was discharged from the Palmach and returned to Kibbutz Ein Hashofet, where he worked in agriculture.

=== Commander of the Givati Brigade ===
The Givati Brigade was one of six brigades established by the Haganah ahead of the Declaration of Independence to prepare for the expected invasion by Arab states. The brigade was formed from Hish units that had been fighting in the Tel Aviv and southern regions, as well as Mahal forces and an Irgun battalion. Immediately after the UN General Assembly vote on November 29, 1947, when the Jewish Yishuv came under attack, the Haganah’s national command assigned Avidan, a seasoned Haganah and Palmach commander, the task of forming the brigade. The name &quot;Givati&quot; was Avidan’s underground alias during the pre-state period.

During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Givati Brigade defended the Tel Aviv region and participated in escorting convoys to Jerusalem and in operations to break through the siege on the road to Jerusalem, such as Operation Nachshon (see below).

==== Commander of Operation Nachshon ====
Operation Nachshon, which began on the night of April 5–6, 1948, and ended on April 15, was the largest Haganah operation in the pre-state phase of the war, during the period of conflict against irregular Arab forces in Palestine and the Arab Liberation Army. This was before the regular armies of the Arab states entered the war. The goal of the operation was to lift the siege of Jerusalem and secure a supply and reinforcement route to the city. David Ben-Gurion regarded Jerusalem as the focal point of the entire campaign and ordered the assembly of a large force of about 1,500 fighters for the operation. Avidan was appointed commander of the operation due to his military experience in the German Platoon and the Palmach, as well as his leadership and personal qualities. The road to Jerusalem was opened, and large supply convoys carrying food and fuel reached the city. Although the road was blocked again after the operation ended, the operation is considered a major victory for the Yishuv in its struggle with the Arabs of Palestine from November 29, 1947, until the declaration of the state.

==== Fighting against the Egyptians ====
With the Arab invasion of the newly declared state immediately following the Israeli Declaration of Independence on May 14, 1948, Avidan&#x27;s Givati Brigade was assigned to fight on the most critical front, against the Egyptian army. During Operation Pleshet, the Givati Brigade fought alongside the Negev Brigade from June 1 to June 3, 1948, to halt the Egyptian army along the coastal road. On May 29, 1948, two weeks after the Arab armies’ invasion, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force began advancing north from Ashkelon. The column consisted of over 500 (1,300 vehicles according to the logbook of the reinforcement platoon from the 53rd Battalion stationed at Nitzanim, reporting to the battalion command in Be&#x27;er Tuvia): trucks, half-tracks, medium tanks, and artillery of all kinds moved in a &quot;parade&quot; along the main road west of Nitzanim towards the town of Isdud (today Ashdod).

The column reached Isdud, with part of it entering the town and the rest continuing north for about 3 kilometers, stopping near the demolished bridge over the Lachish River (Ad Halom Bridge). This bridge had been blown up by Givati sappers on May 12, 1948, as part of Operation Barak. The distance to Tel Aviv was only 32 kilometers, and no significant military force stood between the Egyptians and Tel Aviv. The bridge became the northernmost point the Egyptians reached in this sector, giving rise to its name.

During the second ceasefire, Givati forces captured the Avidis stronghold and defended it from enemy attacks. They then captured Hill 105 and prevented the isolation of Negba, which had withstood heavy attacks from both the air and ground. This action was carried out by the brigade&#x27;s jeep unit, which earned the name &quot;Samson&#x27;s Foxes.&quot;

On September 13, 1948, a ceremonial parade of the Givati Brigade took place in Rehovot, with thousands of soldiers participating. For the first time, the brigade’s unit insignia—a sword flanked by cactus leaves—was displayed on the left shoulder of every soldier.

As part of Operation Yoav, the Givati Brigade, under Avidan&#x27;s command, captured the &quot;Junction Strongholds&quot; (modern-day intersections of Highway 35 and Highway 232) and the Hulikat Strongholds, thereby opening the road to the Negev and encircling a large Egyptian force in the Faluja Pocket.

=== Postwar activities and death ===

After the war, Avidan was appointed head of the Operations Department in the IDF General Staff. In 1949, he retired from the IDF following a disagreement with Defense Minister David Ben-Gurion and returned to his kibbutz. His rank upon retirement was lieutenant colonel (Sgan-Aluf), which at the time was a senior rank, just below major general. Avidan’s name is forever associated with the Givati Brigade, which fought fierce battles in the War of Independence and stopped the Egyptian advance towards Tel Aviv.

In the post-war years, Avidan was the security coordinator for HaKibbutz HaArtzi and the security expert for Mapam, which at the time was one of the leading political parties in the country. He was widely regarded by the public as a man of conscience and high moral authority. Avidan was active in the institutions of HaKibbutz HaArtzi and later served as the movement’s secretary.

In 1969, during the War of Attrition, Avidan’s son, Dan, was taken captive by the Egyptians. A jeep he was riding in near the Suez Canal as the deputy commander of a post was hit by a mine, and he was captured with both legs crushed. He returned from captivity only after the end of the Yom Kippur War.

In 1976, Avidan was appointed by Defense Minister Shimon Peres as Comptroller of the Defense Establishment. He held this position until the political upheaval of 1977, when the Likud party, led by Menachem Begin, came to power. Afterward, Avidan did not hold any official position.

Shimon Avidan worked for many years in the agriculture sector of Kibbutz Ein Hashofet and in the kibbutz&#x27;s factory. He was an amateur archaeologist and established a museum on the kibbutz. His brother was Walter Koch, who Hebraized his name to Uri Kochva, and was an artist and painter, a member of Kibbutz Na&#x27;an.

Shimon Avidan passed away in 1994 at the age of 83. He was buried in his kibbutz, Ein Hashofet.

After his death, streets in Tel Aviv, Rishon LeZion, Holon, and Beersheba were named in his honor.

<doc id="336466" wikidata="Q3506611" url="?curid=336466" title="Swing Time Records">
<text>Swing Time Records was a United States–based record label active in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The label was founded by Jack Lauderdale in 1947 as Down Beat Records and was headquartered in Los Angeles, California. In approximately October 1949 the name was changed to Swing Beat Records, and around March 1950 the name was changed again to Swing Time. The company went bankrupt in 1953 but continued releasing singles as late as February 1954.

Ray Charles, Percy Mayfield, Lowell Fulson, and other rhythm and blues and swing era artists of the 1940s first recorded for this company. It is possible to find certain releases on more than one label name.

==Leasing, purchasing, reissuing, signings==
Lauderdale started his label by recording the Lucky Thompson Quartet with Dodo Marmarosa in late 1946 (releasing three discs during 1947). Felix Gross &amp; His Sextet were another early signing (releasing eight discs during 1947 through 1949). He then leased/reissued recordings by the Five Soul Stirrers from Bronze Records (releasing three discs in 1947). Next up was the leasing/reissuing of Lowell Fulson&#x27;s recordings for Bob Geddins&#x27; Big Town/Down Town/Cava-Tone group of labels and the Bob Geddins/Rene LaMarre-partnered Trilon label (a total of 12 discs were released starting in 1947 through 1949). Jack also got masters of Jimmy McCracklin &amp; His Blues Blasters from Trilon.

In 1950 Lauderdale purchased all the master recordings by the Charles Brown–led Johnny Moore&#x27;s Three Blazers from Leon René&#x27;s Exclusive Records, plus the masters by Brown&#x27;s ex-wife, Mabel Scott. Lauderdale purchased Al Patrick&#x27;s defunct Supreme Records label and reissued recordings by Jimmy Witherspoon with Jay McShann&#x27;s band featuring Louis Speiginer on guitar, Paula Watson, Percy Mayfield, Floyd Dixon with bass player Eddie Williams&#x27; Trio (AKA The Brown Buddies), Sister Emily Bram, the Stars of Harmony gospel group, and Maxwell Davis&#x27; band with Marshal Royal starting in late 1950 through 1951.

Added to all this activity was the signing of pianist Lloyd Glenn as recording artist/house band leader/session arranger and label A&amp;R man. Also signed-up were Pete Johnson&#x27;s band with Big Joe Turner, and the Maxin/Maxim Trio with Ray Charles. Dexter Gordon&#x27;s quintet with Wardell Gray recorded a session (releasing two discs), and songwriter/bass player Shifty Henry recorded for the Swing Time label (one disc released in 1950). Two late signings were Play Boy Thomas (two discs recorded/released in 1953), and the Hollywood Flames featuring Bobby Byrd (one disc in 1954).

Several Swing Time recordings (i.e. all the holiday singles) were given permanent lease to Hollywood Records.

==Numbering system==
The Down Beat/Swing Beat/Swing Time Records numbering system ran from No. 100 (1947) through No. 347 (1954). Lauderdale also started up a subsidiary label in late 1952: his Flame Records numbering system ran from No. 1001 through No. 1009.
