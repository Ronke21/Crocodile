<text>Cao Fang () (232–274), courtesy name Lanqing, was the third emperor of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. He was an adopted son of Cao Rui, the second ruler of Wei. Cao Fang ruled from January 239 to October 254 as a nominal emperor before he was deposed by the regent Sima Shi, after which he became known as the &quot;Prince of Qi&quot;. After the fall of Wei in February 266, Cao Fang was conferred the title of &quot;Duke of Shaoling&quot; by Emperor Wu of the Jin dynasty. When he died in 274, he was granted the posthumous name &quot;Li&quot;, so his full posthumous title became &quot;Duke Li of Shaoling&quot;.

==Background==
Cao Fang&#x27;s parentage is disputed, though he was probably a son of Cao Kai, the Prince of Rencheng, a son of Cao Zhang. He was adopted by Wei&#x27;s second emperor Cao Rui at a young age. He was instated as the Prince of Qi in September 235.

In early January 239, when Cao Rui became ill, he resolved to pass the throne to Cao Fang. Initially, he wanted to entrust Cao Fang to his uncle Cao Yu (曹宇), who would serve as a regent along with Xiahou Xian (夏侯獻), Cao Shuang, Cao Zhao (曹肇), and Qin Lang (秦朗). However, Cao Rui&#x27;s trusted officials Liu Fang (劉放) and Sun Zi (孫資) were not on good terms with Xiahou Xian and Cao Zhao, and were apprehensive about them becoming regents. Eventually, Cao Rui was persuaded to appoint Cao Shuang and Sima Yi. Cao Yu, Cao Zhao and Qin Lang were excluded from the regency.

Half a month later, when Cao Rui was on his deathbed, Sima Yi arrived at Luoyang. Cao Rui held onto Sima&#x27;s hand and summoned Cao Fang and Cao Xun (another adopted son of Cao Rui) to his bedside. He pointed out Cao Fang and told the boy to hug Sima, as he would hug his father. Cao Rui then instated Cao Fang as crown prince and died on the same day (22 January 239).

==Reign==
Although Cao Fang ruled for the longest period of time of all the rulers of Cao Wei, he was not in control of state power at any time during his reign. During his reign, the political scene was dominated by regents - Cao Shuang initially; then Sima Yi after he seized power from Cao Shuang during the Incident at the Gaoping Tombs. After Sima Yi&#x27;s death, Cao Fang attempted to take back state power from Sima Yi&#x27;s son, Sima Shi, but was not successful and was eventually deposed by Sima Shi.

===Under Cao Shuang&#x27;s regency===

Cao Shuang and Sima Yi initially shared state power when they ruled as regents, but over time, Cao gradually stripped off Sima&#x27;s power. He requested for Sima to be promoted to higher appointments and granted honorific titles, but the holder of these appointments and titles do not wield any power. After that, Cao Shuang made all important decisions and stopped consulting Sima. Many of Cao&#x27;s associates, such as Deng Yang (鄧颺), Li Sheng (李勝), He Yan (何晏), and Ding Mi (丁謐), were appointed as high-ranking officials. Those not associated with Cao were excluded from holding positions in the imperial court. Sima was granted military authority, including command in defending Cao Wei from Eastern Wu&#x27;s attack in 241, but he had no real authority on governance.

On 29 May 243, Cao Fang married Empress Zhen, a granddaughter of his grandmother Lady Zhen&#x27;s brother Zhen Yan ().

In 244, Cao Shuang led an attack on Shu Han&#x27;s border city of Hanzhong, without careful planning, hoping that he would gain a reputation in the military. The battles were inconclusive and Cao was forced to withdraw with great losses when their food supplies ran out (Battle of Xingshi). Despite this failure, Cao continued to hold on to state power firmly. In 247, Sima Yi retired from government service, claiming that he was ill.

In February 249, Sima launched a coup to seize power from Cao Shuang. While Cao Fang and Cao Shuang left the capital Luoyang to visit Cao Rui&#x27;s tomb, Sima rallied a group of anti-Cao Shuang officials and closed all gates of Luoyang. He sent an edict to Cao Fang in the name of Empress Dowager Guo, accusing Cao Shuang of dominating and corrupting the government, and demanding that Cao Shuang and his brothers be removed from power. Cao Shuang eventually decided to surrender his authority, against the advice of Huan Fan. Sima promised Cao Shuang that he could still retain his titles. However, a few days later, Sima had Cao Shuang and his family and associates executed on charges of treason. By then, Sima Yi was in complete control of the government.

===Under Sima Yi&#x27;s regency===

After Sima Yi took over as regent, he carefully but inexorably eliminated his political opponents. Cao Fang, under coercion by Sima&#x27;s supporters, offered Sima the nine bestowments, but Sima declined. During Sima&#x27;s regency, he eliminated inefficiency and corruption that characterized Cao Shuang&#x27;s time, and many honest officials were promoted on Sima&#x27;s recommendation.

In 249, Wang Ling, the general in charge of the southeastern city of Shouchun, plotted a rebellion against Sima Yi, in association with Cao Biao (曹彪), the Prince of Chu. In 251, when Wang was ready to carry out his plan, his subordinates Huang Hua (黃華) and Yang Hong (楊弘) betrayed him to Sima. Sima led an army to Shouchun before Wang could take action, and promised to pardon Wang for rebelling. Wang surrendered and was forced to commit suicide together with Cao Biao later. Wang&#x27;s clan and followers were also slaughtered. Sima Yi died later in September that year and was succeeded by his son Sima Shi as regent, who continued wielding state power.

===Deposal by Sima Shi===
In 252, Sima Shi led a campaign against Eastern Wu, whose founding emperor Sun Quan had recently died, and the current ruler Sun Liang was under Zhuge Ke&#x27;s regency. Although Sima was defeated, he maintained himself well by publicly admitting his faults and promoting the generals who had advised him against the campaign. In 253, Sima defeated Zhuge Ke in a major battle and established a reputation in the military.

In 254, Sima made a violent move to consolidate power at the expense of Cao Fang. Cao Fang had endeared himself to the minister Li Feng, and Sima suspected that they were plotting against him. Sima summoned and interrogated Li, who refused to disclose his conversations with the emperor. Sima beat Li to death with a sword handle and accused Li and his associates Xiahou Xuan and Zhang Ji (張緝) of treason, and had them and their clans exterminated. Cao Fang was forced to depose Empress Zhang (Zhang Ji&#x27;s daughter) and replace her with Empress Wang.

Cao Fang was angry with Sima Shi about the deaths of Li Feng and Zhang Ji. Later in 254, his supporters proposed a plan for him to seize power from Sima Shi: when Sima Shi&#x27;s brother Sima Zhao arrived at the palace for an official visit before heading to Chang&#x27;an, Cao Fang would kill Sima Zhao and take control of his troops, and use those troops to attack Sima Shi. Cao Fang was apprehensive and hesitated in implementing the plan. Sima Shi heard about the plot and removed Cao Fang from the throne. Cao&#x27;s life was spared and he was demoted to his previous title of Prince of Qi.

==Later life and death==
After his deposal, Cao Fang was moved to a palace in Henei. When Sima Zhao&#x27;s son Sima Yan usurped the throne of Cao Wei in February 266 and established the Jin dynasty, Cao Fang and other Cao Wei princes were demoted to the status of dukes. He died in 274 and was posthumously granted the title of &quot;Duke Li of Shaoling&quot;, with a funeral befitting that of a duke instead of an emperor. He did not have any known descendants.

<doc id="344488" wikidata="Q1037731" url="?curid=344488" title="Generation name">
<text>Generation name (variously zibei or banci in Chinese; tự bối, ban thứ or tên thế hệ in Vietnamese; hangnyeolja in Korea) is one of the characters in a traditional Chinese, Vietnamese and Korean given name, and is so called because each member of a generation (i.e. siblings and paternal cousins of the same generation) share that character.

== Generation poem ==
The sequence of generation names is typically prescribed and kept in record by a generation poem ( or ) specific to each lineage. While it may have a mnemonic function, these poems can vary in length from around a dozen characters to hundreds of characters. Each successive character becomes the generation name for successive generations. After the last character of the poem is reached, the poem is usually recycled, though occasionally it may be extended.

Generation poems were usually composed by a committee of family elders whenever a new lineage was established through geographical emigration or social elevation. Thus families sharing a common generation poem are considered to also share a common ancestor and have originated from a common geographical location.

Certain groups of generation names are grouped into 5 characters in order for one to remember the generation poem in the historic past before writing was abundantly available. Each hand&#x27;s 5 fingers therefore represent one group of generation names. Committees of Family Elders can be seen counting &amp; pronouncing each generation name with their hands &amp; fingers.

Important examples are the generation poems of the descendants of the Four Sages (Confucius, Mencius, Yan Hui, Zengzi): the Kong, Meng, Yan, and Zeng families (the Four Families, ). During the Ming dynasty, Emperor Jianwen respected Confucius and Mencius so much that he honored their families with generation poems. These generation poems were extended with the permission of the Chongzhen Emperor of the Ming dynasty, the Tongzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty, and the Ministry of Interior of the Beiyang government.
The generation poem used by the Song dynasty House of Zhao was &quot;若夫，元德允克、令德宜崇、師古希孟、時順光宗、良友彥士、登汝必公、不惟世子、與善之從、伯仲叔季、承嗣由同。&quot; The 42 characters were split into three groups of 14 for the offspring of Song Taizu and his two brothers.

Another notable generation poem is the Nguyễn dynasty&#x27;s &quot;Đế hệ thi&quot; (帝係詩 &#x27;Poem of the Generations of the Imperial Family&#x27;), created by Emperor Minh Mạng.

== Practice ==
Generation names may be the first or second character in a given name, and normally this position is kept consistent for the associated lineage. However some lineages alternate its position from generation to generation. This is quite common for Korean names. Sometimes lineages will also share the same radical in the non-generation name.

A related custom is the practice of naming two children from the characters of a common word. In Chinese, most words are composed of two or more characters. For example, by taking apart the word &quot;jiàn-kāng&quot; (&#x27;healthy&#x27;), the Wang family might name one son Wáng Jiàn (王健) and the other Wáng Kāng (王康). Another example would be &quot;měi-lì&quot; (&#x27;beautiful&#x27;). Daughters of the Zhous might be named Zhōu Měi (周美) and Zhōu Lì (周丽).

Besides the Han majority, the Muslim Hui Chinese people have also widely employed generation names, which they call &quot;lunzi paibie&quot;; for instance, in the Na family, the five most recent generations used the characters Wan, Yu, Zhang, Dian, and Hong. This practice is slowly fading since the government began keeping public records of genealogy.

The Yao people of Guangdong has also adopted the Chinese name system, albeit with extensions known as &quot;sub-family-names&quot; to indicate branches. Some groups have more recently (circa Song Dynasty) adopted the generation name system with little modification.

== Example ==
The following is a fictional family to illustrate how generation names are used.




== Affiliation character ==
In place of a biological generation, the character could be used as an indicator of seniority and peer groups in religious lineages. Thus, in the lay Buddhist circles of Song and Yuan times, it could be Dào ( &#x27;dharma&#x27;), Zhì ( &#x27;prajñā, wisdom&#x27;), Yuán ( &#x27;complete, all-embracing&#x27;), Pǔ ( &#x27;universal&#x27;), Jué ( &#x27;bodhi, enlightenment&#x27;), Shàn ( &#x27;skillful, virtuous&#x27;). The characters demonstrated belonging to a devotionalist group with a social status close to the family one. The affiliation character Miào ( &#x27;profound, marvelous&#x27;) usually was used by women, relating them to Guanyin, as Miàoshàn (妙善) was her name at birth.

In the same way, taking the monastic vows meant the break with the family lineage, which was shown by application of the Buddhist surname Shì (, Thích in Vietnam) in one&#x27;s Dharma name, the first character of Gautama Buddha&#x27;s title in Chinese: &quot;Shìjiāmóuní&quot; (釋迦牟尼, &#x27;Śākyamuni&#x27;, &#x27;Sage of the Śakyas&#x27;).

<text>Nachos are a Tex-Mex dish consisting of tortilla chips or &quot;totopos&quot; covered with cheese or chile con queso, as well as a variety of other toppings and garnishes, often including meats (such as ground beef or grilled chicken), vegetables (such as chili peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, and olives), and condiments such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream. At its most basic form, nachos may consist of merely chips covered with cheese (usually cheddar or American cheese), and served as an appetizer or snack, while other versions are substantial enough to serve as a main course. The dish was created by, and named after, Mexican restaurateur Ignacio &quot;Nacho&quot; Anaya, who created it in 1943 for American customers at the Victory Club restaurant in Piedras Negras, Coahuila.

==History==
Nachos originated in the city of Piedras Negras, Coahuila in Mexico, across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas in the United States. Ignacio &quot;Nacho&quot; Anaya created nachos in 1943 at the restaurant the Victory Club when Mamie Finan and a group of U.S. military officers&#x27; wives, whose husbands were stationed at the nearby U.S. Army base Fort Duncan, traveled across the border to eat at the Victory Club. When Anaya was unable to find the cook, he went to the kitchen and spotted freshly fried pieces of corn tortillas. In a moment of culinary inspiration, Anaya cut fried tortillas into triangles, added shredded cheese, sliced pickled jalapeño peppers, quickly heated them, and served them. After tasting the snack, Finan asked what it was called. Anaya responded, &quot;Well, I guess we can just call them Nacho&#x27;s Special.&quot; In Spanish, &quot;Nacho&quot; is a common nickname for Ignacio.
Anaya also opened his own restaurant, Nacho&#x27;s Restaurant, in Piedras Negras. Anaya&#x27;s original recipe was printed in the 1954 &quot;St. Anne&#x27;s Cookbook&quot;.

The popularity of the dish swiftly spread throughout Texas and the Southwestern United States. The first known appearance of the word &quot;nachos&quot; in English dates to 1949, from the book &quot;A Taste of Texas&quot;. According to El Cholo Spanish Cafe history, waitress Carmen Rocha is credited with making nachos in San Antonio, Texas, before introducing the dish to Los Angeles at the cafe in 1959.

A modified version of the dish, with cheese sauce and prepared tortilla chips, was marketed in 1976 by Frank Liberto, owner of Ricos Products, during Texas Rangers baseball games at Arlington Stadium in Arlington, Texas. This version became known as &quot;ballpark nachos&quot;. During the September 4, 1978 &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game between the Baltimore Colts and Dallas Cowboys, sportscaster Howard Cosell enjoyed the name &quot;nachos,&quot; and made a point of mentioning the dish in his broadcasts over the following weeks, further popularizing it and introducing it to a whole new audience.
Liberto died in 2017.

Ignacio Anaya died in 1975. In his honor, a bronze plaque was erected in Piedras Negras, and October 21 was declared the International Day of the Nacho. Anaya&#x27;s son, Ignacio Anaya, Jr., served as a judge at the annual nacho competition.

==Nutritional information==
The nutritional breakdown and total calorie count for a serving of nachos typically depends on the type of nacho, type of cheese, and additional toppings (such as beef, jalapeños, etc.) that are included in the serving. Most typical corn tortilla chips contain about 15 calories per chip. Baked corn tortilla chips have about 6 calories per chip. Mexican-style cheddar cheese contains about 110 calories per ounce. Adding an additional source of protein, such as chicken or beef, increases the calorie count by about 100 calories or so. All in all, a single serving of nachos can contain from 300 to 600 total calories.

A single serving of nachos also contains significant amounts of fat, sodium, and calcium. There are around 16 grams of fat, 816 mg of sodium, and 272 mg of calcium per serving of nachos. In other words, one serving contains 39% of the daily value for fat, 34% of the daily value for sodium, and 27% of the daily value for calcium.

==Variations==

A variation consists of a quartered and fried tostada topped with a layer of refried beans or various meats and a layer of shredded cheese or nacho cheese, topped with habanero hot sauce.

Other variations include barbecue nachos (in which barbecue sauce is added, sometimes in place of salsa, hot sauce or cheese sauce) and poutine nachos (in which cheddar cheese is replaced with cheese curds and gravy). Although those variations use nontraditional ingredients, these versions are still classified as nachos. In the Southeastern United States, pulled pork nachos, also called barbecue nachos, are very popular. In this variation, the nachos retain their cheese and often jalapeños, but are also topped with pulled smoked pork shoulder served with or without barbecue sauce or hot sauce. Some Irish-themed restaurants and bars serve &quot;Irish Nachos&quot; with toppings placed over potatoes (French fries) instead of tortilla chips. A Pacific Northwestern version of nachos called totchos, or Tot-Chos is a variation in which tortilla chips are replaced with deep-fried or baked tater tots. Although similar, these would not be classified as nachos as they lack tortilla chips, an essential ingredient in nachos.

Traditional nachos consist of the tortilla chips topped with cheese and jalapeños, as done by Anaya. The modern form of nachos has several possible ingredients with the most common toppings being cheese, guacamole, salsa, sour cream, jalapeños, olives, refried beans, ground beef, chicken, and sometimes lettuce. Lettuce is a less common topping, if added at all. Toppings may be served buffet-style to allow diners to create their own nachos. The topping of the greatest quantity is often the cheese.

Nachos vary from the modern style served in restaurants to the quick and easy nachos sold at concession stands in stadiums. The nachos commonly sold at concession stands in the U.S. consists of tortilla chips topped with pump-able cheese sauce. The cheese sauce comes in condensed form to which water or milk and pepper juice are added. What is contained in the condensed form itself is a trade secret. Another variation of nachos is &quot;dessert nachos&quot;. These vary widely, from cinnamon and sugar on pita chips to &quot;s&#x27;more nachos&quot; with marshmallow and chocolate on graham crackers, and typically refer to a dessert consisting of scattered toppings on some form of crispy base.

==Ingredients==
Common toppings include:
* Black beans, pinto beans, or refried beans
* Chile con queso or chili con carne
* Cilantro
* Chives or scallions
* Meat, usually ground beef, sliced steak, chicken, chorizo, or &quot;carne asada&quot;; occasionally bacon, pepperoni, corned beef, or Spam
* Guacamole
* Jalapeño or other &quot;Capsicum&quot; peppers, or hot sauce
* Lettuce
* Lime
* Olives
* Onions
* Garlic
* Pickles
* Pico de gallo or salsa
* Sour cream
* Salad dressing
* Ranch dressing
* Tomatoes

See also the common cheeses used:
* Processed cheese
* Cheddar cheese
* Mozzarella cheese
* Cotija cheese
* Oaxaca cheese
* Swiss cheese
* Provel cheese
* Monterey Jack
* Pepperjack cheese
* Cheese curd
Nachos with an abundance of toppings are sometimes called &quot;loaded nachos&quot;. This type of dish is usually served as an appetizer at bars or restaurants in the United States and elsewhere. Typically, the tortilla chips are arranged on a platter, meat and refried bean toppings are then added, and the entire platter is smothered with shredded cheese. The platter is then put into a broiler or microwave to cause the cheese to melt. The platter is then covered with the cold toppings (shredded lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, jalapeños, etc.) and served immediately.

In Memphis, Tennessee, barbecue nachos are served in most barbecue restaurants, and also at sporting events. Generous portions of barbecued pork shoulder are placed atop tortilla chips, then covered with melted cheese or nacho cheese, barbecue sauce, and sliced jalapeño peppers.

In Hawaii, kalua pork and pineapple nachos are served in many restaurants and bars. Generous portions of kalua pork and pineapple bits are placed atop tortilla chips, then covered with melted cheese or nacho cheese, and varied toppings.

A similar dish that involves tortilla chips and cheese is found in Tex-Mex restaurants. Small bowls of chile con queso or, more commonly, salsa are served with baskets of warm tortilla chips as appetizers.

===Nacho cheese===

A form of processed cheese sauce mixed with peppers and other spices is often used in place of freshly shredded cheese in institutional or large-scale production settings, such as schools, movie theaters, sports venues, and convenience stores, or wherever using freshly grated cheese may be logistically prohibitive. Though originally formulated as a cheaper and more convenient source of cheese to top nachos, this dip has become popular enough in the U.S. that it is available in some Mexican-themed restaurants, and at major grocery stores, in both name-brand (Frito-Lay, Tostitos, and Taco Bell) and unbranded versions.

== In popular culture ==
In the United States, National Nacho Day is celebrated on November 6. The International Nacho Festival is held between October 13 and 15 at Piedras Negras, the birthplace of nachos, and features live music, art, cultural activities, and a contest for the biggest nacho of the world which is registered with the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

On April 21, 2012, the world&#x27;s biggest serving of nachos was made by Centerplate at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas. It weighed and contained of nacho chips, of salsa, of tomato, of meat and beans, and more than of cheese.

A new record was set on September 25, 2022, when a 4,870 lb, or 2,209 kg, plate of nachos was served at a promotional event to celebrate a new season for the revived Beavis and Butt-Head. Paramount+ held the party at an open air food market in Los Angeles, California. Show creator, Mike Judge, was present for the event and award presentation and said: &quot;This is the proudest moment of my career.” Portions of the food, including leftovers, were packaged and donated to food banks and local homeless shelters.

==Notes==

:1.In the original published accounts quoting Anaya, Sr., he says that he added the jalapeño before heating them. However, Anaya&#x27;s son, Ignacio Anaya, Jr., is quoted as saying &quot;My father was maître d&#x27; and he said &#x27;Let me go quick and fix something for you.&#x27; He went into the kitchen, picked up tostadas, grated some cheese on them—Wisconsin cheese, the round one—and put them under the salamander (a broiling unit that browns the top of foods). He pulled them out after a couple of minutes, all melted, and put on a slice of jalapeño.&quot;

<doc id="344492" wikidata="Q1650556" url="?curid=344492" title="Ro language">
<text>Ro is an a priori constructed language created by Rev. Edward Powell Foster beginning in 1904.

==Characteristics==
In Ro, words are constructed using a category system. For example, all words starting with &quot;bofo-&quot; signify colors; the word for &quot;red&quot; is &quot;bofoc&quot;, and &quot;yellow&quot; is &quot;bofof&quot;. Foster did not simply try to design a better language in general, but to optimize his language for one design criterion: recognizability of unknown words. Foster wrote about Ro:

After working on the language for about two years, Foster published the first booklet about Ro in 1906. The publication of Ro periodicals was supported by several American sponsors, especially from the Marietta, Ohio area, including Melvil Dewey, inventor of the Dewey Decimal Classification (another attempt to categorize human knowledge), Vice President Charles G. Dawes, George White, who mentioned Ro in the Congressional Record, and Alice Vanderbilt Morris of IALA. Several more books about Ro by Foster and his wife appeared over the years, as late as 1932. The entirety of George White&#x27;s mention of Ro in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; reads: &quot;By Mr. WHITE (by request) : Resolution (H. Res. 432) providing for an investigation of a new language known as Ro ; to the Committee on Education.&quot;

A common criticism of Ro is that it can be difficult to hear the difference between two words; usually one consonant makes the word different in meaning, but still similar enough that the intended meaning often cannot be guessed from context. This characteristic is common among philosophical languages, which are characterized by vocabulary developed taxonomically, independently of natural languages. &quot;A posteriori&quot; languages, such as Esperanto and Interlingua, are more popular than the &quot;a priori&quot; type, perhaps partly because their familiar vocabulary makes them easy to learn and recognize. Conversely, a priori languages are seen as being more neutral because there are so many languages and root words used in different languages may be completely different.

Solresol was an earlier classificatory language that by using a smaller symbol set achieved easier distinctness. There have been a few more recent attempts to design a language along similar lines, such as Ygyde and the Japanese-made Babm, but most subsequent constructed language makers have avoided this taxonomic or hierarchic design for the reasons mentioned above.

==Alphabet and pronunciation==
Ro is written with the Latin alphabet. The letters C, J, Q and X are pronounced as: /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /ŋ/ and /χ/ respectively. The vowels (A, E, I, O and U) are pronounced as in the Spanish language.

==Sample text==
The following sample is from &quot;Esperanto, Elvish, and Beyond: The World of Constructed Languages&quot;. It is the last stanza of William Cullen Bryant&#x27;s &quot;Thanatopsis&quot; translated into Ro by Foster himself:

==Encoding==
Ro has been assigned the codes and in the ConLang Code Registry.

<text>Klamath County was a county of California from 1851 to 1874. During its existence, the county seat moved twice and ultimately portions of the territory it once had were carved up and added to nearby counties. It was formed from the northwestern portion of Trinity County, and originally included all of the northwestern part of the state, from the Mad River in the south to Oregon in the north, from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the middle of what is now Siskiyou County in the east. It is the only county in California to be disestablished.

==History==
The original county seat was Trinidad, on the county&#x27;s southwestern coast. In 1854 the county seat was moved to Crescent City, because of its larger population. But the western portion of the county was unrepresentative of the mining interests in the eastern portion of the county, and so, in 1856, the county seat was moved inland, to Orleans Bar, now Orleans. In 1857, Del Norte County, including Crescent City, was split off from Klamath County.

The county&#x27;s economy was never healthy after the gold rush. The area was contested with indigenous tribes. The &quot;Klamath and Salmon River Indian &quot;War&quot;&quot;and the 1858-1864 &quot;Bald Hills War&quot; involved European-American vigilantes hunting down and killing most indigenous adult males and killing, capturing, or enslaving women and children. Many of the captive indigenous subsequently died of starvation and exposure at Fort Humboldt. The European-American settler&#x27;s economy suffered from the effects of the Indian &quot;wars&quot;, which disrupted the supplies to the settlements from the coastal towns. Worse still was the devastating effects of the Great Flood of 1862 which swept away the riverside settlements, mining works and ferries. 

In 1874 Klamath County was finally abolished, divided between Siskiyou and Humboldt counties. Present day Del Norte County occupies part of Klamath County.

<doc id="344498" wikidata="Q115276" url="?curid=344498" title="Bar, Montenegro">
<text>Bar (Montenegrin: Bar, Бар, , ) is a town and seaport in Coastal region of Montenegro. It is the capital of the Bar Municipality and a center for tourism. According to the 2023 census, the city proper had 15,868 inhabitants, while the total population of Bar Municipality was 46,171.

==Name==
Bar is supposed to be a shortened Slavic variant of &quot;Antivari&quot;. The name is thought to be derived from the Latin &quot;Antibarum&quot; or &quot;Antibari&quot;, which later in Greek was transformed into &quot;Antivárion / Antivari&quot; due to its pronunciation. &quot;Antibari&quot;, meaning &quot;opposite Bari&quot;, is a name taken because of it is location across the Adriatic Sea from Bari in Italy. Variations are in Italian, &quot;Antivari / Antibari&quot;; in Albanian, &quot;Tivari&quot; or &quot;Tivar&quot;; in Turkish, &quot;Bar&quot;; in Greek, Θηβάριον, &quot;Thivárion&quot;, Αντιβάριον, &quot;Antivárion&quot;; in Latin, &quot;Antibarium&quot;.

==History==

===Ancient times===
Archaeological findings of substantial extent prove the presence of life in this location during prehistoric times. Local archaeological findings date to the Neolithic era. It is assumed that Bar was mentioned as the reconstructed Roman castle, &quot;Antipargal&quot;, in the 6th century. The name &quot;Antibarium&quot; was quoted for the first time in the 10th century.

===Middle Ages===
In the 6th and 7th centuries, Slavs occupied the Balkans. Duklja, a Slavic state, was mentioned in the 10th century. Jovan Vladimir (ruler 1000–1016), of Skadarska Krajina is the first ruler of Duklja whose history is known. Stefan Vojislav (ruler 1018–1043), the eponymous founder of the Vojislavljević dynasty, defeated the Byzantines in a battle on a hill near Bar. He made Bar his seat of power. Vojislav then expanded the area under his rule. Mihailo I of Duklja (ruler 1050–1081), Vojislav&#x27;s son, established the Archdiocese of Antivari. He continued to fight the Byzantines in order to secure the town&#x27;s independence. This led to a union of states known as the Serbian Grand Principality. From 1101 to 1166, the principality was ruled by the Vukanović dynasty. However from 1166 to 1183, Bar was under Byzantine rule. In 1183, Stefan Nemanja conquered and destroyed Bar. Until 1360 it was ruled by the Nemanjić dynasty. From 1360 onward, it comes under the control of the Balšić noble family, and Queen Jelena and Balša III establish the capital there.

===Venetian and Ottoman period===
Between 1405 and 1412. Venetians controlled Bar, and this was also the time when the city had the most growth. The Venetians granted the Barans rights in an effort to appease and win them over, and as a result, Bar developed into a city-state. Barans had their own Statute of Communes, were in charge of their own defense, possessed judicial authority, printed their own currency, and were exempt from military service in times of war. After the Venetians, Bar was again ruled by the Balšićs. Stefan Lazarević and Đurađ Branković also occupied Bar in the first half of the 15th century.
From 1443 to 1571, the region was ruled by the Venetians, who called it &quot;Antivari&quot;, and it was part of the Venetian Albania. It was a town with its own coat of arms, flag, statute and mint. In 1571, the Ottomans captured Antivari and held the town until 1878. The archdiocese was preserved. With the Ottoman conquest, the Catholic Church in the border area and the Archdiocese of Bar began to collapse, because indigenous people who began to migrate as Ottomans to that area brought a new ethnic and religious element. Because of a lack of Catholic priests, entire parishes were converted to Orthodoxy. One of the archbishops during this period was Andrija Zmajević. 

In 1571, The Ottomans expelled the Orthodox and Catholic population. 

In 1878, The Ottomans ceded Antivari to Montenegro at the Treaty of Berlin, after losing the Russo-Turkish War. Montenegro&#x27;s initial main goal in the negotiations was its expansion into Herzegovina and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, but Austro-Hungarian expansion made it unrealistic. The Ottomans, represented by Alexander Karatheodori Pasha, declared that they would cede the port of Spizza to Montenegro but not Bar and other areas because they claimed they were primarily inhabited by Catholics and Muslim Albanians. After negotiations between Foreign Ministers Gyula Andrássy (Austria-Hungary) and Pyotr Andreyevich Shuvalov (Russia), it was agreed that Bar would be ceded to Montenegro in return for Russian support for Austrian control over Herzegovina. The city-port of Bar itself became militarily neutral, the total number of Montenegrin vessels in the port was placed under limitations and Austria-Hungary acquired the right of patrol of Bar&#x27;s coastline.

In 1885 the castle of King Nikola was built. The king had it constructed for his daughter Princess Zorka and his future son-in-law Prince Petar Karađorđević. It has a chapel, watchtower, winter garden, small and huge castles, and a park. A wooden pier for docking ships was located in front of the structure. Additionally, there is a sizable flower shop with unique construction, a gift from King Emmanuel of Italy, and a catering establishment called &quot;&quot;Knjaževa bašta&quot;.&quot; The former castle complex is now the Bar Heritage Museum, which hosts cultural events.

In the new Montenegrin Orthodox state, Bar went through urban depopulation because many of its urban inhabitants were Muslims, who either left or were expelled from the town. In the late 1850s, the town had 4,000 inhabitants, 62.5% of which were Muslims. More than half of its population left or was expelled after 1878. The first population register of the town under Montenegrin administration in 1879, counted 1,879 inhabitants. Muslims were 30.9% of the population, 24.6% were Catholics (mostly Albanians) in addition to Orthodox (mostly Montenegrins and Serbs).

===Contemporary===
When the Montenegrins recaptured the city after Russo-Turkish War, life could not be organized in it due to the destruction of war. The population first moved to Podgrađe, and the urban core was formed at the beginning of the 20th century below Volujica. The settlement is called Pristan (Novi Bar).

Guglielmo Marconi, the Italian scientist and pioneer in wireless telegraphy, using Nikola Tesla&#x27;s patented technology, made a radio connection between Antivari (Bar) and Bari on 30 August 1904. In 1908, the first railroad in this part of the Balkans was put into operation there.

On 8 August 1914 Austria-Hungary responded to Montenegro&#x27;s declaration of war by sending their protected cruisers SMS &quot;Zenta&quot; and SMS &quot;Szigetvár&quot; accompanied by the destroyer SMS &quot;Uskoke&quot; and torpedo boat &quot;72F&quot; to conduct an unopposed bombardment of the port of Antivari, targeting its wireless station and harbour facilities. They were driven away by coastal batteries and destroyed only a wireless station. The Austrians declared a formal blockade of the Montenegrin coastline on August 10. On August 16, SMS &quot;Zenta&quot; and an accompanying destroyer were ambushed and trapped off Antivari by a very large French fleet (over twelve battleships), and in the subsequent Battle of Antivari the &quot;Zenta&quot; was sunk with considerable loss of life. The destroyer escaped. On the 18 September following, the Austro-Hungarian coastal battleship SMS &quot;Budapest&quot; with supporting warships bombarded Antivari, the port and facilities, causing major damage, and on October 17–18 the destroyers SMS &quot;Scharfschutze&quot;, SMS &quot;Streiter&quot; and SMS &quot;Ulan&quot; bombarded Antivari&#x27;s harbour. On November 18 the destroyer SMS &quot;Uskoke&quot; also conducted a brief bombardment. The Austrians made their largest raid to date on the evening and night of 1–2 March 1915 when their destroyers SMS &quot;Csikós&quot;, SMS &quot;Streiter&quot;, and SMS &quot;Ulan&quot; covered a raid by three torpedo-boats into Antivari harbour. The latter destroyed the main wharf and stocks of food and ammunitions along the waterfront, and captured the Montenegrin royal yacht &quot;Rumija&quot;, which was later torpedoed. The destruction of the wharves prevented larger ships from unloading supplies at the port restricting Allied shipments of food and munitions to the Montenegrin army. The Allies realised that with the Austro-Hungarian naval base of Cattaro close by there was little they could do. 

In 1918, Bar became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

In 1945, Albanians in Bar were massacred by Yugoslavs partisans. This event is known as the Bar massacre.

In 1976, Pristan was demolished, with the aim of expanding the Port in its place. The population was mainly moved to Topolica, where until urbanization there was only a complex of the Castle of King Nicholas.

After the catastrophic earthquake of 1979, especially conditioned by the work of the Port of Bar, the city experienced a demographic boom. In the period until 1990, Bar was one of the crucial ports of SFR Yugoslavia, which was invested in and which became the political, industrial, tourist, cultural, sports center of the region. This was especially contributed by the opening of the roads Bar-Titograd in 1959 and Bar-Belgrade in 1976.

When Montenegro signed an agreement with the Chinese Government to build a motorway from Bar to the Serbian border (part of the Belt and Road initiative) in 2014, large tracts of land around Bar were agreed as collateral in the event of the Montenegro government defaulting on payment of the 1 billion dollar loan. The project was financed by the Export-Import Bank of China. Contractual disputes can only be resolved through a Chinese court.

<doc id="344500" wikidata="Q171018" url="?curid=344500" title="Zlín">
<text>Zlín (in 1949–1989 Gottwaldov; ; ) is a city in the Czech Republic. It has about 74,000 inhabitants. It is the seat of the Zlín Region and it lies on the Dřevnice River. It is known as an industrial centre. The development of the modern city is closely connected to the Bata Shoes company and its social scheme, developed after World War I. A large part of Zlín is urbanistically and architecturally valuable and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
Zlín consists of 16 municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Zlín (48,317)
*Prštné (3,345)
*Louky (1,027)
*Mladcová (2,525)
*Příluky (2,931)
*Jaroslavice (822)
*Kudlov (2,195)
*Malenovice (7,156)
*Chlum (144)
*Klečůvka (332)
*Kostelec (1,909)
*Lhotka (235)
*Lužkovice (634)
*Salaš (195)
*Štípa (1,798)
*Velíková (613)
Prštné, Louky, Mladcová, Příluky, Jaroslavice, Kudlov and Malenovice are urbanistically fused with Zlín. They are sometimes called Zlín II–VIII, which was part of their name at the time when they were administratively merged with Zlín.

==Etymology==
There are several legends about the origin of the name of the city, according to which it was derived from &quot;slín&quot; (i.e. &quot;marl&quot;) or &quot;zlaté jablko&quot; (i.e. &quot;golden apple&quot;). However, the name Zlín was most likely derived from the old personal Slavic name Zla, Zlen or Zleš.

From 1949 to 1989, the city was renamed &quot;Gottwaldov&quot; after the first communist president of Czechoslovakia Klement Gottwald. On 1 January 1990, the city&#x27;s name was changed back to Zlín.

==Geography==
Zlín is located about east of Brno. It forms an urban area together with the town of Otrokovice. The territory of the city lies in the Vizovice Highlands. The highest point is the hill Tlustá hora at above sea level. The Dřevnice River flows through the city. The Fryšták Reservoir is situated in the northern part of the municipal territory.

===Climate===
Zlín&#x27;s climate is classified as humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dobk&quot;). Among them, the annual average temperature is , the hottest month in July is , and the coldest month is in January. The annual precipitation is , of which July is the wettest with , while January is the driest with only . The extreme temperature throughout the year ranged from on 9 February 1956 to on 8 July 1957.

==History==

===14th–16th centuries===
The first written mention of Zlín is from 1322, when it was acquired by Queen Elizabeth Richeza. In that time, Zlín was already a market town and served as a craft guild centre for the surrounding area of Moravian Wallachia. From 1358, the Zlín estate was owned by Bishop Albrecht of Šternberk and soon became the seat of the Moravian branch of the Šternberk family. In 1397, the town privileges of Zlín were extended and Zlín became a town. This significantly helped the economic development of Zlín.

The Hussite Wars badly affected properties of the Sternbergs and they were forced to sell Zlín in 1437. In the second half of the 15th century, Zlín was threatened by the Bohemian–Hungarian War. The 16th century brought peace and prosperity to the town. Trade and crafts flourished, mainly drapery, pottery and shoemaking. New villages were founded in the vicinity of Zlín, which became a large town and economic centre.

===17th–19th centuries===

In 1605, Zlín was raided and burned by Hungarian rebels. The Thirty Years&#x27; War left the town severely damaged and half deserted. The residents of Zlín, along with people from the whole Wallachian region, led an uprising against the Habsburg monarchy. The rebellion was however bloodily suppressed in 1644. After the war, Zlín became property of the Hungarian noble family of Serényi, but they did not care much for the town, and therefore Zlín recovered only slowly.

Economic activity was restored in the 18th century. Larger industrial enterprises appeared in the mid-19th century. A small match factory was established in 1850 and a shoe factory in 1870, but both were soon closed, and the town continued to live mainly from the work of craftsmen. In 1899, the railway was built.

===20th century===

Zlín began to grow rapidly after Tomáš Baťa and his siblings founded a shoe factory there in 1894, known as Bata Company. Production gradually increased, as did the number of employees and the population of the town. Baťa&#x27;s factory supplied the Austro-Hungarian army in World War I. Due to the remarkable economic growth of the company and the increasing prosperity of its workers, Baťa himself was elected mayor of Zlín in 1923.

Baťa became the leading manufacturer and marketer of footwear in Czechoslovakia in 1922. Besides producing footwear, the company diversified into engineering, chemistry, rubber technology and many more areas. The factory hired thousands of workers who moved to Zlín. A new large complex of modern buildings and facilities was gradually built by the Baťa&#x27;s company on the outskirts of the town in 1923–1938. It included thousands of flats, schools, department stores, scientific facilities, and a hospital. The development took place in a controlled manner and was based on modern urban concepts with the contribution of important architects of the time. Zlín became a hypermodern industrial city with functionalist character unique in Europe.

After death of Tomáš Baťa in 1932, the company was managed by Jan Antonín Baťa, Hugo Vavrečka and Dominik Čipera, who also became the mayor. The Baťa company and also the city of Zlín continued growing. In 1929–1935, a strong economic agglomeration Zlín – Otrokovice – Napajedla developed. In 1935, the city became the seat of the administrative district.

During World War II, life in the city was controlled by German occupiers, and development of both the city and the company stopped. Zlín was most severely affected by the war in 1944, when it was bombed by the U.S. army and large parts of the factories were destroyed. Zlín was liberated by the Soviet and Romanian armies on 2 May 1945.

The communists took over management of Zlín and Baťa factories, and in October 1945 the Bata company in Czechoslovakia was nationalised. In the following decades, Zlín preserved its significant position thanks to its extensive industrial production. The city strengthened its position as administrative, economic, educational and cultural centre of eastern Moravia. Zlín further expanded with construction of new housing estates.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
The largest industrial employer with headquarters in Zlín is TAJMAC-ZPS, a manufacturer of machine tools with more than 500 employees. Bata Corporation (in the Czech Republic officially known as Baťa a.s.) is now primarily a trading company and shoe production takes place outside the city.

Zlín is home to many large companies and organizations of the service sector. The largest employer in the city is the Regional Hospital of T. Baťa with more than 3,000 employees. Other notable employers are HP Tronic (main activity is trade in consumer electronics under the Datart and Eta brands), Tomas Bata University in Zlín (education) and Tescoma (trade and manufacture of kitchen utensils).

The Zlín agglomeration was defined as a tool for drawing money from the European Structural and Investment Funds. It is an area that includes the city and its surroundings, linked to the city by commuting and migration. It has about 130,000 inhabitants.

==Transport==

In the 1920s local passenger transportation started to operate. Later, in 1939 the town council decided to build three trolleybus routes, numbered lines A, B and C. New trolleybus lines were finished in 1944, after the construction proceeding during the Nazi occupation. Through the times, Zlín&#x27;s public transport, now owned by DSZO (Zlín &amp; Otrokovice Transportation Company), was one of the fastest-growing public transportation networks in the Czech Republic.

The city is currently served by 14 bus routes and 14 trolleybus routes, and also railway services on line 331, which runs from Otrokovice (located on the international corridor) to Vizovice. There are nine stations on this line within the city of Zlín, the largest of which is &quot;Zlín střed&quot;.

==Education==

In 1969, the Faculty of Technology was founded here as a branch of the Brno University of Technology. In 2001, it was one of two faculties which formed the newly established Tomas Bata University in Zlín. With more than 9,000 students, it ranks as a medium-sized Czech university. It is formed by six faculties: Technology, Management and Economics, Multimedia Communications, Applied Informatics, Humanities, and Logistics and Crisis Management.

==Culture==
Zlín is located in the cultural region of Moravian Wallachia near the tripoint of the cultural regions of Moravian Wallachia, Moravian Slovakia and Hanakia.

Given Zlín&#x27;s history as one of the biggest centres of filmmaking in the Czech Republic, probably the biggest cultural event is the Zlín Film Festival with subtitle &quot;International Film Festival for Children and Youth&quot;.

Winter version of international music festival Masters of Rock takes place in Zlín.

Zlín is home to the Bohuslav Martinů Philharmonic Orchestra; its chief conductor is Tomáš Brauner, while its principal guest conductor is Leoš Svárovský.

==Sport==
Zlín&#x27;s ice hockey team PSG Berani Zlín plays in the 1st Czech League (2nd tier) and has won national titles in 2004 and in 2014. The association football team FC Zlín plays in the Czech National Football League (2nd tier), but played in the top tier in 2015–2024. The city also has teams in other sports including volleyball, basketball, Czech handball, softball and rugby.

==Architecture==
The city&#x27;s architectural development was a characteristic synthesis of two modernist urban utopian visions: the first inspired by Ebenezer Howard&#x27;s Garden city movement and the second tracing its lineage to Le Corbusier&#x27;s vision of urban modernity. From the very beginning Baťa pursued the goal of constructing the Garden City proposed by Ebenezer Howard. However, the shape of the city had to be &#x27;modernized&#x27; so as to suit the needs of the company and of the expanding community. The urban plan of Zlín was the creation of František Lydie Gahura, a student at Le Corbusier&#x27;s atelier in Paris.

==Sights==

The Villa of Tomáš Baťa was an early architectural achievement. The construction was completed in 1911. The building&#x27;s design was carried out by the architect Jan Kotěra. After its confiscation in 1946, the building served as a Pionýr&#x27; house. Being returned to Tomáš J. Baťa, the son of the company&#x27;s founder, the building now houses the headquarters of the Thomas Bata Foundation.

Baťa&#x27;s Hospital was founded in 1927 and quickly developed into one of the most modern hospitals in Central Europe. The original architectural set up was designed by F. L. Gahura.

The Grand Cinema was designed by the architect F. L. Gahura and built in 1932. This technological marvel became the largest cinema in Central Europe in its time with a capacity of 2,270 seated viewers. Today it has 1,010 seats.

Tomas Bata Memorial was built in 1933 by F. L. Gahura. The original purpose of the building was to commemorate the achievements of Baťa. The building itself is a Constructivist masterpiece. It has served as the seat of the Bohuslav Martinů Philharmonic Orchestra since 1955.

Baťa&#x27;s Skyscraper was built as the headquarters for the worldwide Baťa organization. Designed by Vladimír Karfík, the huge building was erected in 1936–1939. It included a room-sized elevator housing the office for the boss, comfortably furnished – with a sink, a telephone, and air conditioning. When it was built it was the tallest Czechoslovak building at . After a costly reconstruction in 2004, it became the seat of the Regional Office of the Zlín Region and the headquarters of the tax office.

In the village of Štípa, there is Lešná Castle. It was built in the Neogothic, Neorenaissance and Neobaroque styles in 1887–1893. It is one of the youngest aristocratic residences in Moravia. The castle was built for the Seilern-Aspang family on the site of an older castle from the 18th century. Today the castle is open to the public and there are collections of unique and historically valuable objects. The castle is located inside the Zlín-Lešná Zoo complex. It is the second most-visited zoo in the country, and as of 2022, it was overall the third most visited tourist destination in the country.

Malenovice Castle is located in Malenovice. It was founded in the second half of the 14th century. The Gothic castle was modified in the Renaissance style in the following centuries. Today part of the castle is open to the public and contains several expositions.

<doc id="344503" wikidata="Q3494527" url="?curid=344503" title="San'yūtei Enchō">
<text>was a Japanese author and rakugo performer of the late Edo and early Meiji eras. He was the founder and head of the of rakugo, and is considered a pioneer of the rakugo revival.

Notable works of his include Japanese horror (&quot;kaidan&quot;) classics: &quot;Kaidan botan dōrō&quot; (based on , and &quot;Shinkei Kasane ga fuchi&quot; (on which many Japanese horror films such as &quot;Kaidan Kasane-ga-fuchi&quot; are based).

==Career==

As a rakugoka, San&#x27;yūtei Enchō differed from the predominantly comedic style of storytelling of his predecessors in favor of a more serious approach, his school coming closer to Kōdan in methodology. In addition to this, his school worked to implement use of subtle background instrumentation and altered stage lighting to accompany his ghost stories, a trend which would become standard today. One of his most well known instances of such would be during performances of .

Some of San&#x27;yūtei Enchō&#x27;s peers would at times work to undermine his performances by performing their own versions beforehand of stories he was expected to, thus seeing to hinder the impact his might have. would act as one such rival. Despite this, he felt as though the manner in which he told stories could not be replicated by anyone else, bearing many traits unique to himself. In addition, he would work to create many new pieces of his own that nobody had seen before.

<doc id="344505" wikidata="Q461024" url="?curid=344505" title="Takasue's daughter">
<text>, also known as Takasue&#x27;s Daughter and Lady Sarashina, was a Japanese noble woman, poet, and author best known for writing the &quot;Sarashina Nikki,&quot; a Heian period travel diary recording her life and travels from her teenage years to her fifties. She is also attributed by some scholars as the author of &quot;Hamamatsu Chūnagon Monogatari&quot; and &quot;Yoru no Nezame.&quot; Her personal name is unknown.

== Name ==
&quot;Sugawara no Takasue no musume&quot; is literally translated as &quot;daughter of Sugawara no Takasue&quot;. In ancient Japanese society, women&#x27;s personal names were generally not recorded in genealogical records. British scholar Ivan Morris, a translator of her diary, referred to her as Lady Sarashina.

Her surname distinguishes her as a direct descendant of Sugawara no Michizane, a prominent statesman, scholar, and poet of the Heian period.

In the Heian period, there was a cultural practice of avoiding the use of personal names, as people feared someone could control them by a message sent to their true name with the power of kotodama. The general belief was nobody could control a person with the power of kotodama unless their true name had been revealed. Therefore, the true names of Heian women writers were not disclosed even in their own writing.

== Life ==
Most of Takasue&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s life is known from her entries in the &quot;Sarashina Nikki&quot;. However, the diary itself does not note specific dates nor proper names. An annotated copy of the diary handwritten by Fujiwara no Teika provides reliable historical information on dates and names.

=== Early life and family ===
Takasue&#x27;s Daughter was born in Kyoto in approximately 1008. Her father was Sugawara no Takasue, who later became the provincial governor of Kazusa and Hitachi Provinces. Her mother was a younger sister of Michitsuna&#x27;s mother, the author of the &quot;Kagero Nikki&quot;.

From ages ten to thirteen, she lived in Kazusa Province, where her father was serving as provincial governor. When she was approximately twelve years old, she began recording a daily account of her events which would later become known as the &quot;Sarashina Nikki&quot;. In 1020, as her father&#x27;s term in Kazusa Province expired, her family returned to Kyoto and lived in a large residence on Sanjo Street until 1023, when the house burned down. According to her diary, her family started living in temporary places. The following year in 1024, her elder sister died in childbirth and in 1025, Sugawara no Takasue failed to obtain a provincial governorship, meaning a period of financial difficulty for the family.

In 1032 when she was approximately 25, her father received a provincial governor posting in Hitachi, where he served for 4 years. As his posting was far away in the East Country, she stayed with her mother in the capital. After Takasue moved back to Kyoto, her mother became a nun but remained in the household. It is presumed that Takasue&#x27;s daughter assumed duties of mistress of the household for her retired father.

=== Court service ===
In 1039, Takasue&#x27;s Daughter received an invitation to serve as a lady-in-waiting for infant Princess Yushi (1038-1105), the third princess of Emperor Gosuzaku. Her service in this household would have brought her in contact with the highest-ranking members of Heian society.

During one of her periods of service in 1042, she had an encounter with high-ranking courtier Minamoto no Sukemichi (d. 1060). This marked the high point of her court career as she was able to converse and exchange poetry with someone who fulfilled the ideal of a courtly gentleman as portrayed in tale literature. A poem she composed during that meeting secured her a place in the &quot;Shinkokinshu&quot;, one of two most prestigious Japanese imperial anthologies of all time.

=== Marriage ===
In 1040, her parents arranged for her to marry Tachibana no Toshimichi, a middle-ranking aristocrat. They had at least two children. The marriage did not end her court career entirely, and she continued to serve from time to time.

She would have been 33 years old at the beginning of her marriage, a late age at a time where most married in their early teens. In Heian aristocratic society, duolocal residence, where a woman was visited by her husband in her own home, was common. Since Takasue&#x27;s Daughter lost her house in a fire in 1023, and her father failed to obtain a provincial governorship in 1025, she is left without a suitable grand residence, meaning her family would have been unable to arrange a good marriage for her.

In 1058, her husband died. Takasue&#x27;s daughter lived on after her husband&#x27;s death, but it is unknown how long. Her last entry in the Sarashina Diary is recorded approximately a year after his death.

=== Fascination with &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; ===
Takasue&#x27;s Daughter was born in the same year that &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; began to circulate as a completed manuscript. During her time growing up in Kazusa, her stepmother gave her oral renditions of episodes from &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; and other tales, which introduced her to prose fiction and vernacular literary works. &quot;Sarashina Nikki&quot; records her interest in literary tales, and reflects her fascination with &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; by making many allusions to the work itself.

<doc id="344507" wikidata="Q1029656" url="?curid=344507" title="Santōka Taneda">
<text>was the pen-name of , a Japanese author and haiku poet. He is known for his free verse haiku—a style which does not conform to the formal rules of traditional haiku.

== Early life ==
Santōka was born in a village located in Yamaguchi prefecture, to a wealthy land-owning family. When he was eleven his mother committed suicide by throwing herself into the family well. Though the exact reason for her action is unknown, according to Santōka&#x27;s diaries his mother had finally reached the point where she could no longer live with her husband&#x27;s philandering. Following the incident, Santōka was raised by his grandmother.

In 1902, he entered Waseda University in Tokyo as a student of literature. While there, he began drinking heavily, and in 1904, at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War, he dropped out of school. The documented reason was &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;, which some believe to be a euphemism for frequent and severe drunkenness. By that time his father Takejirō was in such dire financial straits that he could barely afford to pay his son&#x27;s tuition.

In 1906, Taneda father and son sold off family land in order to open a &quot;sake&quot; brewery. In 1909 his father arranged for Santōka to marry Sato Sakino, a girl from a neighboring village. In his diaries, Santōka confesses that the sight of his mother&#x27;s corpse being raised from her watery grave had forever tarnished his relationship with women. In 1910 Sakino gave birth to a son, Ken.

== Life as a Poet ==
In 1911, Santōka began publishing translations of Ivan Turgenev and Guy de Maupassant in the literary journal under the pen name Santōka (山頭火). The name is originally one of the list of &quot;natchin&quot; (納音), i.e., labels given to a person&#x27;s year of birth according to the Chinese sexegenary cycle, which are used for divination. However, the &quot;natchin&quot; Santōka is unrelated to the actual year in which the poet was born.

The word Santōka can be understood in at least two different ways. The literal meaning is &quot;Mountain-top Fire&quot;. However, it can also mean &quot;Cremation-ground Fire&quot;, since &quot;mountain-top&quot; is a metaphor for cremation grounds in Japanese. It has been speculated that this choice of name could be related to the traumatic experience of the suicide of Santōka&#x27;s mother.

That same year, 1911, Santōka joined his area&#x27;s local haiku group. At that time, his haiku mostly adhered to the traditional syllabic format, though some were hypersyllabic, for example:

:In a café we debate decadence a summer butterfly flits

In 1913, Santōka was accepted as a disciple by the leading haiku reformist Ogiwara Seisensui. Seisensui (1884–1976) could be regarded as the originator of the free-form haiku movement, though fellow writers Masaoka Shiki and Kawahigashi Hekigoto also deserve recognition. Writers following the early-twentieth century movement known as free-form or free-style haiku (&quot;shinkeikō&quot; 新傾向, lit. &#x27;new trend&#x27;) composed haiku lacking both the traditional 5-7-5 syllabic rule and the requisite seasonal word (&quot;kigo&quot;).

Santōka began regularly contributing poetry to Seisensui&#x27;s haiku magazine &quot;Sōun&quot; (層雲, Layered Clouds). By 1916 he became an editor.

That same year, however, was marked by the bankruptcy of his father&#x27;s &quot;sake&quot; brewery after two years of spoiled stock. The family lost all that remained of their once great fortune. His father fled into hiding and Santōka moved his family to Kumamoto City on the southern island of Kyūshū, where plans to open a second-hand bookstore soon materialized into the opening of a picture frame shop. Two years later, plagued by debt, Santōka&#x27;s younger brother Jirō committed suicide. Then Santōka&#x27;s grandmother died. In 1919, at the age of thirty-seven, Santōka left his family in order to find a job in Tokyo. In 1920, following her parents&#x27; wishes, Santōka divorced his wife. His father died soon after.

As an exponent of free style haiku, Santōka is often ranked alongside Ozaki Hōsai (1885–1926), a fellow student of Seisensui. They both suffered from the ill effects of their drinking habits and were similar in their reliance on Seisensui and other patrons of the arts for aid and support. The literary tone of their poems, however, differs.

Santōka proved no more reliable at working a steady job than he had at going to college, and though he did secure a permanent position as a librarian in 1920, by 1922 he was again unemployed due to another &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;. He stayed in Tokyo long enough to experience the Great Kantō earthquake, after which he was apparently jailed as a suspect Communist. Soon after being released, he returned to Kumamoto City where he helped Sakino keep shop.

In 1924, an extremely drunk Santōka jumped in front of an oncoming train in what may have been a suicide attempt. The train managed to stop just inches from him, and he was brought by a newspaper reporter to the Sōtō Zen temple Hōon-ji, where the head priest Mochizuki Gian welcomed him to the Zen fraternity. The Zen life seemed to work for Santōka: by the next year at the age of forty-two he was ordained in the Sōtō sect.

In 1926, after a year spent as caretaker of Mitori Kannon-dō temple in Kumamoto, Santōka set out on the first of many walking trips. He was away for three years. Part of this time was spent completing the eighty-eight temple pilgrimage circuit on Shikoku Island. He visited the gravesite of his deceased friend Ozaki Hōsai.

In 1929 he returned briefly to Kumamoto to visit Sakino and publish some more haiku in &quot;Sōun&quot;. He also began a publication of his own, , named after his boardinghouse. Soon, however, he was back on the road.

During his trips, Santōka wore his priest&#x27;s robe and a large bamboo hat known as a &quot;kasa&quot; to keep off the sun. He had one bowl, which he used both for alms-getting and for eating. To survive, he went from house to house to beg. Begging (&quot;takuhatsu&quot;) is an important part of practice for monks in Japan, but, considering that Santōka was not a member of a monastery while he journeyed, begging just for his own needs, he was often regarded with disdain and on a few occasions even questioned by the police. A day&#x27;s earnings would go toward a room at a guesthouse, food, and sake. It is clear from his diaries that he had very mixed feelings about his lifestyle:

In 1932, Santōka settled down for a time at a cottage in Yamaguchi prefecture. He named it &quot;Gochūan&quot; (其中庵) after a verse in the Lotus Sutra. While there, he published his first book of poems, . He lived on the contributions of friends and admirers, whatever he could grow in his garden, and money sent from his son Ken. In 1934 he set off again on a walking trip, but soon grew seriously ill and had to return home. He attempted suicide but lived. In 1936, he again began to walk, intent on following the trail of the famous haiku poet Bashō (1644–1694) as described in &quot;Oku no Hosomichi (The Narrow Road to the Interior)&quot;. He returned to Gōchuan after eight months.

In 1938, Gochūan became unfit for habitation, and after another walking trip, Santōka settled down at a small temple near Matsuyama City. On October 11, 1940, Santōka died in his sleep. He had published seven collections of poems and numerous editions of &quot;Sambaku&quot;. He was fifty-seven.

== Poetry ==
The following poem is a typical example of Santōka&#x27;s work:

What, even my straw hat has started leaking

笠も漏り出したか

&quot;kasa mo moridashita ka&quot;

This poem exhibits two major features of free verse haiku:

* It is a single utterance that cannot be subdivided into a 5-7-5 syllable structure, and
* It does not contain a season word.

The poem does, however, hint at a natural phenomenon—rain—by referring to the straw hat and to the fact that it is leaking.

---Another interpretation / 
I&#x27;m traveling by myself wearing a straw hat.
It began to rain, and my face began to get wet.
There is no place to take shelter from the rain in an unpopular place.
But I keep walking.

Below are further examples of free haiku poems by Santōka:

* Excerpts from Hiroaki Sato&#x27;s translation of Santōka&#x27;s &quot;Grass and Tree Cairn&quot;:
:I go in I go in still blue mountains
:&quot;Wakeitte mo wakeitte mo aoi yama&quot;

:Fluttering drunk leaves scatter
:&quot;Horohoro yōte ki no ha chiru&quot;

* Excerpts from Burton Watson&#x27;s translation &quot;For All My Walking&quot;:

:there
:where the fire was
:something blooming
:&quot;yake-ato nani yara saite iru&quot;

:feel of the needle
:when at last
:you get the thread through it
:&quot;yatto ito ga tōtta hari no kanshoku&quot;

<text>Fritz Albert Lipmann (; June 12, 1899 – July 24, 1986) was a German-American biochemist and a co-discoverer in 1945 of coenzyme A. For this, together with other research on coenzyme A, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1953 (shared with Hans Adolf Krebs).

==Early life and education==
Lipmann was born in Königsberg, Germany, to a Jewish family. His parents were Gertrud (Lachmanski) and Leopold Lipmann, an attorney.

Lipmann studied medicine at the University of Königsberg, Berlin, and Munich, graduating in Berlin in 1924. He returned to Königsberg to study chemistry under Professor Hans Meerwein. In 1926 he joined Otto Meyerhof at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology, Dahlem, Berlin, for his doctoral thesis. After that he followed Meyerhof to Heidelberg to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research.

==Career==
From 1939 on, Lipmann lived and worked in the United States. He was a Research Associate in the Department of Biochemistry, Cornell University Medical College, New York from 1939 to 1941. He joined the research staff of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston in 1941, first as a Research Associate in the Department of Surgery, then heading his own group in the Biochemical Research Laboratory of the hospital. From 1949 to 1957 he was professor of biological chemistry at Harvard Medical School. From 1957 onwards, he taught and conducted research at Rockefeller University, New York City.

In 1953, Lipmann received one half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine &quot;for his discovery of co-enzyme A and its importance for intermediary metabolism.&quot; The other half of the award was won by Hans Adolf Krebs. Lipmann was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1966. He would try to dive further into his discovery by finding a variant of co-enzyme A, now known as Pantethine. He was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

Lipmann introduced the specific squiggle designation (~) to indicate high energy-rich phosphate in energy-rich biomolecules like ATP in his essay &quot;Metabolic Generation and Utilization of Phosphate Bond Energy.&quot; Of his work, he said &quot;that in the field of biosynthesis we have a rare example of progress leading to simplification.&quot;

==Personal life==

In 1931, Lipmann married Elfreda M. Hall. They had one son. Lipmann died in New York in 1986.The photo shows Mary Soames, not Elfreda Hall Lipmann His widow died in 2008 at the age of 101.

<doc id="344516" wikidata="Q550290" url="?curid=344516" title="Cao Mao">
<text>Cao Mao (; 241 – 2 June 260), courtesy name Yanshi, was the fourth emperor of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He was a grandson of Cao Pi, the first emperor of Wei. Described as intelligent and studious, Cao Mao made repeated attempts to seize back state power from the regent Sima Zhao but failed. He was killed in an abortive &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against Sima Zhao.

==Family background and accession to the throne==
Cao Mao was a son of Cao Lin, the Prince of Donghai (東海王), a son of Cao Pi. In 244, at the age of three, in accordance with Wei&#x27;s regulations that the sons of princes (other than the first-born son of the prince&#x27;s wife, customarily designated as the prince&#x27;s heir) were to be instated as dukes, Cao Mao was enfeoffed as the &quot;Duke of Gaogui District&quot; (高貴鄉公). Cao Lin died in 249 when Cao Mao was eight. Cao Mao&#x27;s elder brother, Cao Qi (曹啟), succeeded their father as the Prince of Donghai.

By 254, state power was in the control of the Sima clan, whose patriarch Sima Yi had seized power from the regent Cao Shuang in 249. After Sima Yi&#x27;s death in 251, the Sima clan was led by his eldest son, Sima Shi. In 254, after falsely accusing Cao Fang&#x27;s father-in-law Zhang Ji (張緝) and Zhang&#x27;s associates Li Feng and Xiahou Xuan of treason, Sima Shi had them and their clans executed. When Cao Fang himself considered a coup against the Simas later that year, Sima Shi had him deposed.

It was at this time that Cao Fang&#x27;s stepmother, Empress Dowager Guo, made a last-ditch attempt at preserving the Cao clan&#x27;s imperial authority by injecting herself into the process of selecting the next emperor. When Sima Shi notified her that he intended to make Cao Pi&#x27;s brother, Cao Ju (曹據), the Prince of Pengcheng, the new emperor, she managed to persuade him that such a succession would be improper since Cao Ju was the uncle of her husband, Cao Rui, and such a succession would leave Cao Rui effectively without an heir. Sima Shi was forced to agree with her to let Cao Mao be the emperor. (Cao Mao, although young (at age 13) was known for his intelligence and Empress Dowager Guo might have believed that he, alone, of the princes and dukes might have had a chance of counteracting the Simas.) When Sima Shi asked her for the imperial seal she again reasoned with him and refused politely, under the reasoning that she had met Cao Mao before and wanted to personally hand him the seal. When Cao Mao was summoned to the capital, he acted in accordance with the ceremonies due a duke rather than putting on imperial pretensions immediately until he was enthroned. This earned him popular support and praise as a humble young emperor.

==Reign==
In 255, generals Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin started a rebellion against the Sima clan in Shouchun, but were quickly crushed by Sima Shi&#x27;s forces. Guanqiu Jian was killed and his clan was slaughtered. Wen Qin and his sons, Wen Yang and Wen Hu (文虎), fled to the rival state of Eastern Wu. Sima Shi died of illness shortly after the rebellion was suppressed. In the aftermath of Sima Shi&#x27;s death, a 14-year-old Cao Mao made another effort to seize back state power. He issued an imperial edict for Sima Shi&#x27;s successor, Sima Zhao, to remain at Xuchang using the excuse that the situation at Shouchun was still not completely peaceful. He also recalled Sima Zhao&#x27;s assistant, Fu Gu, to return to the capital with the troops. However, on the advice of Fu Gu and Zhong Hui, Sima Zhao ignored the edict and returned to Luoyang and continued to remain in control of the government.

Over the next few years, Cao Mao gradually established a circle of people around him, including Sima Zhao&#x27;s cousin Sima Wang, Wang Shen, Pei Xiu and Zhong Hui, all of whom were known for their literary talent. These people were unquestioned in their support for the Sima clan, but they might also have something to gain if they pledged allegiance to Cao Mao. In doing so, Cao Mao was hoping that he could reduce Sima Zhao&#x27;s suspicions against him while winning support from these people. He often held meetings with them to discuss literature. In addition, he gave Sima Wang a fast two-wheeled wagon and five imperial guardsmen as escorts because Sima Wang lived further away from the palace than the others.

Around 257, Zhuge Dan, who replaced Guanqiu Jian as military commander in Shouchun, started a rebellion against Sima Zhao with support from the rival state of Eastern Wu. Sima Zhao led an army to suppress the revolt and trapped the rebels in the city by early 258. Internal conflict broke out in Shouchun between Zhuge Dan and Wen Qin (returned from Eastern Wu to support the revolt) which concluded with Wen Qin&#x27;s death at Zhuge Dan&#x27;s hands and the defection of Wen Qin&#x27;s sons to Sima Zhao. Shouchun eventually fell to Sima Zhao&#x27;s forces and the rebellion was effectively crushed. In 259, Cao Mao received reports of sightings of yellow dragons (a sign of divine favour) in two wells. He commented that it was actually a sign of divine disfavour and wrote a poem titled &quot;Ode to the Hidden Dragon&quot; (濳龍詩):

:&quot;The poor dragon is trapped, alone and cold;&quot;
:&quot;He cannot leap out of the depths;&quot;
:&quot;He cannot rise to the heavens;&quot;
:&quot;He cannot even descend onto fields.&quot;

:&quot;The poor dragon fell into the deep well;&quot;
:&quot;Even catfish dance before him;&quot;
:&quot;He hides his teeth and claws and sighs;&quot;
:&quot;And I am this depressed as well?&quot;

The poem greatly displeased Sima Zhao, who would pay more attention to Cao Mao&#x27;s activities afterwards. In 258, under pressure from Sima Zhao, Cao Mao issued an edict granting him the nine bestowments, but Sima Zhao declined.

==Attempted coup against Sima Zhao and death==
In May 260, Cao Mao was again forced to issue an edict granting Sima Zhao the title of Duke of Jin and the nine bestowments; which Sima Zhao earnestly declined nine times, and after being forced to do so again, he declined them yet another time, which only managed to irritate Cao Mao further. Cao Mao gathered his associates Wang Shen, Wang Jing and Wang Ye, and announced his plan for a last effort against Sima Zhao to regain his power. Wang Shen and Wang Ye went to warn Sima Zhao. Personally armed with a sword, Cao Mao led his personal guard to go from the palace to attack Sima Zhao. Sima Zhao&#x27;s brother, Sima Zhou, led a defence at a gate but was routed. Jia Chong led another defense at the southern watchtower and ordered his officer Cheng Ji to kill Cao Mao. Cheng Ji stabbed Cao Mao in the chest with a spear, killing him.

Sima Zhao forced Empress Dowager Guo to publish an order accusing Cao Mao of plotting to attack her and posthumously strip Cao Mao of rank, in order to present the attack as primarily aimed against the empress dowager rather than himself. Sima Zhao with his uncle, Sima Fu, and the other high ministers then requested Sima Zhao to have Cao Mao posthumously reinstated as a duke and buried with honours befitting a prince – for appearances of leniency. However, Sima Zhao refused so Cao Mao was not buried with honours befitting a prince. Sima Zhao also retroactively declined his title as Duke of Jin and the nine bestowments.

Sima Zhao blamed Cheng Ji for the regicide, and ordered his familial extermination. Cao Huang (later renamed to Cao Huan), the Duke of Changdao, was enthroned as the new emperor as a result, the last puppet emperor of Wei before Sima Zhao&#x27;s son, Sima Yan, usurped the Wei throne in February 266.

<text>__NoTOC__
 was a Japanese author, critic, playwright, translator, editor, educator, and professor at Waseda University. He has been referred to as a seminal figure in Japanese drama.

== Biography ==
He was born &quot;Tsubouchi Yūzō&quot; (坪内 雄蔵), in Gifu prefecture. He also used the pen name &quot;Harunoya Oboro&quot; (春のや おぼろ).

His book of criticism, &quot;Shōsetsu Shinzui&quot; (The Essence of the Novel), helped free novels and dramas from the low opinion that the Japanese had of such literature. Tsubouchi&#x27;s writings on realism in literature influenced Masaoka Shiki&#x27;s ideas about realism in haiku. Tsubouchi&#x27;s novel, &quot;Tōsei Shosei Katagi&quot; (Portraits of Contemporary Students), was one of the earliest modern novels in Japan.

His Kabuki play &quot;Kiri Hitoha&quot; (&quot;A Paulownia Leaf&quot;) was influenced by his studies of both the famous Kabuki and Jōruri (puppet theater) dramatist Chikamatsu Monzaemon and William Shakespeare. The play, in turn, influenced modern Kabuki. He also did a complete translation of the plays of Shakespeare, written in the old-fashion language of Kabuki.

His modern play, &quot;Shinkyoku Urashima&quot;, incorporating traditional dance and music, was a popular and critical success. The play was a retelling of a familiar Japanese folk-tale with a Rip Van Winkle-like protagonist, Urashima Tarō.

Besides Shakespeare, he also translated a number of other works from English into Japanese, including Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot; and Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s novel &quot;Rienzi, the Last of the Roman Tribunes&quot;.

Tsubouchi founded and edited the periodical &quot;Waseda Bungaku&quot; (Waseda Literature), which published from 1891 to 1898. Tsubouchi is also noted for the long running ronsō (literary dispute) that he carried on with Mori Ōgai.

The Waseda University Tsubouchi Memorial Theatre Museum was named in his honour and houses a large collection of his works. A bronze bust of him was also placed there.

<text>The Gifford Lectures () are an annual series of lectures which were established in 1887 by the will of Adam Gifford, Lord Gifford at the four ancient universities of Scotland: St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Their purpose is to &quot;promote and diffuse the study of natural theology in the widest sense of the term – in other words, the knowledge of God.&quot; A Gifford lectures appointment is one of the most prestigious honours in Scottish academia.

University calendars record that at the four Scottish universities, the Gifford Lectures are to be &quot;public and popular, open not only to students of the university, but the whole community (for a tuition fee) without matriculation. Besides a general audience, the Lecturer may form a special class of students for the study of the subject, which will be conducted in the usual way, and tested by examination and thesis, written and oral&quot;. The lectures are normally presented as a series over an academic year and given with the intent that the edited content be published in book form. A number of these works have become classics in the fields of theology or philosophy and the relationship between religion and science. 

In 1889, those attending the Gifford Lectures at the University of St Andrews were described as &quot;mixed&quot; and included women as well as male undergraduates. The first woman appointed was Hannah Arendt who presented in Aberdeen between 1972 and 1974.

A comparable lecture series is the John Locke Lectures, which are delivered annually at the University of Oxford.

<doc id="344522" wikidata="Q248244" url="?curid=344522" title="Tamiki Hara">
<text>was a Japanese writer and survivor of the bombing of Hiroshima, known for his works in the atomic bomb literature genre.

==Biography==
Hara was born in Hiroshima in 1905. In his early years, he was an introverted personality who suffered from anxiety states. While he was a middle school student, Hara became familiar with Russian literature, and also began to write poetry. He particularly admired the poets Murō Saisei and Paul Verlaine. After graduating from the English literature department of Keio University, he published prose and poetry works in &quot;Mita Bungaku&quot; magazine. In 1933, he married Sadae Sasaki, sister of literary critic Kiichi Sasaki. For a limited time, he was also affiliated with Japan&#x27;s left wing movement.

Sadae died in 1944 after long years of illness. Hara had once said of her, &quot;were my wife to die before me, I would live only one year longer to leave behind a volume of beautiful, sad poetry&quot;. One year later, he was exposed to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima at his parents&#x27; home. These two traumatic experiences became central to his work.

His best-known work, &quot;Summer Flower&quot; (&quot;Natsu no Hana&quot;), an account of the devastation he witnessed in Hiroshima, was published in June 1947 and received the first Takitaro Minakami Prize. Two further sections of this story followed later, &quot;From the Ruins&quot; (&quot;Haikyou kara&quot;) in November 1947, and &quot;Prelude to Annihilation&quot; (&quot;Kaimetsu no joukyoku&quot;) in January 1949. He also wrote poems on the same theme, while his 1950 short story &quot;Utsukushiki shi no kishi ni&quot; (lit. &quot;On the brink of a beautiful death&quot;) documented his wife&#x27;s last days. The 1949 &quot;Chinkonka&quot; (lit. &quot;Requiem&quot;) treated Sadae&#x27;s death and the deaths in Hiroshima almost as one single loss.

The 1951 short story &quot;The Land of Heart&#x27;s Desire&quot; (&quot;Shingan no kuni&quot;) was Hara&#x27;s final, posthumously published work. His already fragile mental state had been exacerbated by the outbreak of the Korean War and president Truman&#x27;s public consideration of the use of atomic bombs. He committed suicide in Tokyo on March 13, 1951, by lying down on the tracks of an oncoming train, a death which he had already contemplated in his last story.

==Legacy==
===In literature===
Writer Yōko Ōta repeatedly thematised Hara&#x27;s suicide in her works, such as the 1953–54 short stories &quot;Fireflies&quot; and &quot;Residues of Squalor&quot;, and her 1954 novel &quot;Han ningen&quot;.

===Commemoration===
An epitaph to Tamiki Hara was built at the site of Hiroshima Castle in November 1951 by writers and literary scholars who had been close to him. After it had been repeatedly exposed to vandalism, it was remodeled and moved to the present site next to the Atomic Bomb Dome in July 1967. The monument bears an inscription of a poem by Hara which reads:

:&quot;Engraved in stone long ago,&quot;
:&quot;Lost in the shifting sand,&quot;
:&quot;In the midst of a crumbling world,&quot;
:&quot;The vision of one flower.&quot;
（遠き日の石に刻み/砂に影おち/崩れ墜つ/天地のまなか/一輪の花の幻）

The anniversary of Tamiki Hara&#x27;s death was named &quot;Kagenki&quot; (花幻忌, &quot;Flower vision mourning&quot;). The &quot;Kagenki society&quot;, formed by admirers of Hara&#x27;s work, hosted an exhibition in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Hara&#x27;s death in 2001, and organises a memorial service in front of his monument every year.

<doc id="344528" wikidata="Q315152" url="?curid=344528" title="Masaoka Shiki">
<text>, pen-name of Masaoka Noboru (正岡 升), was a Japanese poet, author, and literary critic in Meiji period Japan. Shiki is regarded as a major figure in the development of modern haiku poetry, credited with writing nearly 20,000 stanzas during his short life. He also wrote on reform of &quot;tanka&quot; poetry.

Some consider Shiki to be one of the four great haiku masters, the others being Matsuo Bashō, Yosa Buson, and Kobayashi Issa.

==Early life==
Shiki, or rather Tsunenori (常規) as he was originally named, was born in Matsuyama City in Iyo Province (present day Ehime Prefecture) to a samurai class family of modest means. As a child, he was called Tokoronosuke (處之助); in adolescence, his name was changed to Noboru (升).

His father, Tsunenao (正岡常尚), was an alcoholic who died when Shiki was five years of age. His mother, Yae, was a daughter of Ōhara Kanzan, a Confucian scholar. Kanzan was the first of Shiki&#x27;s extra-school tutors; at the age of 7 the boy began reading Mencius under his tutelage. Shiki later confessed to being a less-than-diligent student.

At age 15 Shiki became something of a political radical, attaching himself to the then-waning Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement and getting himself banned from public speaking by the principal of Matsuyama Middle School, which he was attending. Around this time he developed an interest in moving to Tokyo and did so in 1883.

==Education==
The young Shiki first attended his hometown Matsuyama Middle School, where Kusama Tokiyoshi, a leader of the discredited Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement, had recently served as principal. In 1883, a maternal uncle arranged for him to come to Tokyo. Shiki was first enrolled in Kyōritsu Middle School and later matriculated into University Preparatory School. (Daigaku Yobimon) affiliated with Imperial University (Teikoku Daigaku). While studying here, the teenage Shiki enjoyed playing baseball and befriended fellow student Natsume Sōseki, who would go on to become a famous novelist.

He entered Tokyo Imperial University in 1890. But by 1892 Shiki, by his own account too engrossed in haiku writing, failed his final examinations, left the Hongō dormitory that had been provided to him by a scholarship, and dropped out of college. Others say tuberculosis, an illness that dogged his later life, was the reason he left school.

==Literary career==
While Shiki is best known as a haiku poet, he wrote other genres of poetry, prose criticism of poetry, autobiographical prose, and was a short prose essayist. (His earliest surviving work is a school essay, &quot;Yōken Setsu&quot; (&quot;On Western Dogs&quot;), where he praises the varied utility of western dogs as opposed to Japanese ones, which &quot;only help in hunting and scare away burglars.&quot;)

Contemporary to Shiki was the idea that traditional Japanese poetic short forms, such as the haiku and &quot;tanka&quot;, were waning due to their incongruity in the modern Meiji period. Shiki, at times, expressed similar sentiments. There were no great living practitioners although these forms of poetry retained some popularity.

Despite an atmosphere of decline, only a year or so after his 1883 arrival in Tokyo, Shiki began writing haiku. In 1892, the same year he dropped out of university, Shiki published a serialized work advocating haiku reform, &quot;Dassai Shooku Haiwa&quot; or &quot;Talks on Haiku from the Otter&#x27;s Den&quot;. A month after completion of this work, in November 1892, he was offered a position as haiku editor in the paper that had published it, &quot;Nippon&quot;, and maintained a close relationship with this journal throughout his life. In 1895 another serial was published in the same paper, &quot;A Text on Haikai for Beginners&quot;, &quot;Haikai Taiyō&quot;. These were followed by other serials: &quot;Meiji Nijūkunen no Haikukai&quot; or &quot;The Haiku World of 1896&quot; where he praised works by disciples Takahama Kyoshi and Kawahigashi Hekigotō, &quot;Haijin Buson&quot; or &quot;The Haiku Poet Buson&quot; (1896–1897) expressing Shiki&#x27;s idea of this 18th-century poet whom he identifies with his school of haiku, and &quot;Utayomi ni Atauru Sho&quot; or &quot;Letters to a Tanka Poet&quot; (1898) where he urged reform of the &quot;tanka&quot; poetry form.

The above work, on &quot;tanka&quot;, is an example of Shiki&#x27;s expanded focus during the last few years of his life. He died four years after taking up &quot;tanka&quot; as a topic. Bedsore and morphine-addled, little more than a year before his death Shiki began writing sickbed diaries. These three are &quot;Bokujū Itteki&quot; or &quot;A Drop of Ink&quot; (1901), &quot;Gyōga Manroku&quot; or &quot;Stray Notes While Lying on My Back&quot; (1901–1902), and &quot;Byōshō Rokushaku&quot; or &quot;A Sixfoot Sickbed&quot; (1902).

==Later life==
Shiki suffered from tuberculosis (TB) much of his life. In 1888 or 1889 he began coughing up blood and soon adopted the pen-name &quot;Shiki&quot; from the Japanese &quot;hototogisu&quot;—the Japanese name for lesser cuckoos. The Japanese word &quot;hototogisu&quot; can be written with various combinations of Chinese characters, including 子規, which can alternatively be read as either &quot;hototogisu&quot; or &quot;&quot;shiki&quot;.&quot; It is a Japanese conceit that this bird coughs blood as it sings, which explains why the name &quot;Shiki&quot; was adopted.

Suffering from the early symptoms of TB, Shiki sought work as a war correspondent in the First Sino-Japanese War and, while eventually obtaining his goal, he arrived in China after the April 17, 1895 signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Instead of reporting on the war, he spent an unpleasant time harassed by Japanese soldiers in Dalian, Luangtao, and the Lüshunkou District, meeting on May 10, 1895 the famous novelist Mori Ōgai, who was at the time an army doctor.

Living in filthy conditions in China apparently worsened his TB. Shiki continued to cough blood throughout his return voyage to Japan and was hospitalized in Kobe. After being discharged, he returned to his home town of Matsuyama city and convalesced in the home of the famed novelist Natsume Sōseki. During this time he took on disciples and promulgated a style of haiku that emphasized gaining inspiration from personal experiences of nature. Still in Matsuyama in 1897, a member of this group, Yanigihara Kyokudō, established a haiku magazine, &quot;Hototogisu&quot;, an allusion to Shiki&#x27;s pen name. Operation of this magazine was quickly moved to Tokyo. Takahama Kyoshi, another disciple, assumed control and the magazine&#x27;s scope was extended to include prose work.

Shiki came to Tokyo, and his group of disciples there were known as the &quot;Nippon school&quot; after the paper where he had been haiku editor and that now published the group&#x27;s work.

Although bedridden by 1897, Shiki&#x27;s disease worsened further around 1901. He developed Pott&#x27;s disease and began using morphine as a painkiller. By 1902 he may have been relying heavily on the drug. During this time Shiki wrote three autobiographical works. He died of tuberculosis in 1902 at age 34.

==Legacy==
Shiki may be credited with salvaging traditional short-form Japanese poetry and carving out a niche for it in the modern Meiji period. While he advocated reform of haiku, this reform was based on the idea that haiku was a legitimate literary genre. He argued that haiku should be judged by the same yardstick that is used when measuring the value of other forms of literature — something that was contrary to views held by prior poets. Shiki firmly placed haiku in the category of literature, and this was unique.

Some modern haiku deviate from the traditional 5–7–5 sound pattern and dispensing with the kigo (&quot;season word&quot;); Shiki&#x27;s haiku reform advocated neither break with tradition.

His particular style rejected &quot;the puns or fantasies often relied on by the old school&quot; in favor of &quot;realistic observation of nature&quot;. Shiki, like other Meiji period writers, borrowed a dedication to realism from Western literature. This is evident in his approach to both haiku and &quot;tanka&quot;.

===Baseball===
Shiki played baseball as a teenager and was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 2002. A group of 1898 &quot;tanka&quot; by him mention the sport.

<text>Yosano Akiko (Shinjitai: , seiji: ; 7 December 1878 – 29 May 1942) was the pen-name of a Japanese author, poet, pioneering feminist, pacifist, and social reformer, active in the late Meiji era as well as the Taishō and early Shōwa eras of Japan. Her name at birth was . She is one of the most noted, and most controversial, post-classical female poets of Japan.

==Early life==
Yosano was born into a prosperous merchant family in Sakai, near Osaka. From the age of 11, she was the family member most responsible for running the family business, which produced and sold yōkan, a type of confection. From early childhood, she was fond of reading literary works, and read widely in her father&#x27;s extensive library. As a high school student, she began to subscribe to the poetry magazine &quot;Myōjō&quot; (Bright Star), of which she became a prominent contributor. &quot;Myōjō&#x27;s&quot; editor, Tekkan Yosano, whom she later married, taught her &quot;tanka&quot; poetry, having met her on visits to Osaka and Sakai to deliver lectures and teach in workshops.

In her youth, Yosano had not been allowed opportunities to interact with the opposite sex, which she cited as the cause for her latent sexuality. She was not allowed to leave her home unaccompanied and could count the number of times she had crossed the threshold of someone else&#x27;s home. After being married she reflected negatively upon her childhood, saying, &quot;I realized for the first time how jaundiced, unfair, and dark my childhood had been.&quot;

Tekkan was married when he met Akiko, and left his wife for her a year after they met one another. The two poets started a new life together in the suburb of Tokyo. They married in 1901, when Yosano was 23, and went on to have 13 children, 11 of whom lived to adulthood. Tekkan had extramarital affairs during their marriage, including with his ex-wife.

==&quot;Midaregami&quot;==
In 1901, Yosano brought out her first volume of &quot;tanka&quot;, &quot;Midaregami&quot; (Tangled Hair), which contained 400 poems and was mostly denounced by literary critics. Despite the critical reaction, it was widely read and became a sort of lighthouse for free-thinkers of her time. Her first book, by far her best-known, brought a passionate individualism to traditional &quot;tanka&quot; poetry, unlike any other work of the late Meiji period.

The majority are love poems through which Akiko expresses her feelings toward Tekkan Yosano. It was through this particular collection that she set an image for herself as well as the stage for female voices in modern Japan. The poems tended to express femininity in a manner unconventional for her time, especially from a female writer.

In traditional Japanese values, women are perceived as (and are expected to be) gentle and modest. The domestic and societal roles of Japanese women were and are focused on procreation and raising children, especially boys. &quot;Midaregami&quot; not only expressed concepts and/or issues that pertain to women and were not normally voiced in such a public manner, but also created a new, revolutionary image of womanhood, as lively, free, sexual, and assertive, nothing at all like the conventional picture of the modest, demure young lady expected in Japan. Yosano&#x27;s women were not passive, but active agents of their love lives. In a typical &quot;tanka&quot;, Yosano wrote: &quot;&#x27;Spring is short; what is there that has eternal life?&#x27; I said, and made his hands seek out my powerful breasts.&quot; The &quot;Midaregami&quot; posed a challenge to the patriarchal values of Japanese society, as well as to the accepted literary and cultural conventions of her time. Although Akiko Yosano&#x27;s work was denounced and severely criticized, it served as a great source of inspiration to women of her day. The American scholar Hiromi Tsuchiya Dollase noted, &quot;The visual representations of flesh, lips and breasts symbolize women’s sexuality&quot;.

No poet had written of breasts in a &quot;tanka&quot; before, which led the poet Nobutsuna Sasaki to attack her in a magazine article for &quot;corrupting public morals&quot; and &quot;mouthing obscenities fit for a whore&quot;. From the examples in the &quot;Midaregami&quot;, the idea of nudity changed the way Japanese people viewed eroticism and female sexuality. Up until this point women&#x27;s breasts were a symbol for child feeding and motherhood. From then on they began to take on a different representation; that of natural beauty, and especially that of young women. A door was opened for Japanese women to imagine new representations of sexuality and the female body.

==A poet&#x27;s life==
She followed this with twenty more &quot;tanka&quot; anthologies over the course of her career, including &quot;Koigoromo&quot; (Robe of Love) and &quot;Maihime&quot; (Dancer). Her husband Tekkan was also a poet, but his reputation was eclipsed by hers. He continued to publish his wife&#x27;s work and to encourage her in her literary career. Yosano Akiko was an extraordinarily prolific writer. She could produce as many as 50 poems in one sitting. During the course of her lifetime, Yosano Akiko is thought to have written between 20,000 and 50,000 poems. She also wrote 11 books of prose, many of which neglected by literary critics and audiences.

Yosano helped to found what was originally a girls&#x27; school, the Bunka Gakuin (Institute of Culture), together with Nishimura Isaku, Kawasaki Natsu and others, and became its first dean and chief lecturer. She assisted many aspiring writers to gain a foothold in the literary world. She was a lifelong advocate of women&#x27;s education. She also translated the Japanese classics into modern Japanese, including the &quot;Shinyaku Genji Monogatari&quot; (Newly Translated Tale of Genji) and &quot;Shinyaku Eiga Monogatari&quot; (Newly Translated Tale of Flowering Fortunes).

Yosano&#x27;s poem &quot;Kimi Shinitamou koto nakare&quot; (君死にたもうこと勿れ, Thou Shalt Not Die), addressed to her younger brother, was published in Myōjō during the height of the Russo-Japanese War and was extremely controversial. Made into a song, it was used as a mild form of anti-war protest, as the number of Japanese casualties from the bloody Siege of Port Arthur became public. In September 1904, Yosano had learned that Japanese soldiers at Port Arthur were being used as &quot;human bullets&quot;, being strapped with explosives and sent to blast holes through the Russian barbed wire entanglements in suicide missions. Yosano&#x27;s younger brother was serving in the Imperial Army and attached to the forces besieging Port Arthur. In &quot;Bushido&quot;, it was the highest honor for a man to die for the Emperor, and knowing of her brother&#x27;s impulsive nature, Yosano was seized with the fear that he might volunteer to be a &quot;human bullet&quot;, inspiring her to write a poem pleading with him to think of his widowed mother.

Addressed to her brother, Yosano wrote: &quot;Did our parents make you grasp the sword and teach you to kill? For you what does it matter whether the fortress of Lüshun [Port Arthur] falls or not?&quot; Yosano attacked the central concept of &quot;Bushido&quot; in the &quot;Kimi&quot;, noting that it was the greatest honor for a man to die for the Emperor, who she sarcastically noted never put himself in harm&#x27;s way, expecting others to die for him. For calling the war with Russia senseless and stupid, Yosano made herself into Japan&#x27;s most controversial poet, and the government attempted to ban her poem. The &quot;Kimi&quot; was so unpopular that Yosano&#x27;s house was stoned by angry people while she became involved in a rancorous debate with the journalist over the question of whether poets had the duty to support the war or not.

The first issue of the literary journal &quot;Seito&quot; in September 1911 featured her poem &quot;The Day the Mountains Move&quot; asking for woman to be given equal rights. In a 1918 article, Yosano attacked &quot;the ruling and military class which deliberately block the adoption of a truly moral system in an effort to protect the wealth and influence of their families...They hurry to invoke the power and precepts of the old totalitarian moral codes to direct the lives of Japanese citizens&quot;. Yosano ended her article by calling militarism a form of &quot;barbarian thinking which is the responsibility of us women to eradicate from our midst&quot;.

Yosano gave birth to 13 children, of whom 11 survived to adulthood. The late Japanese politician Yosano Kaoru was one of her grandsons.

==Feminist perspective==
Yosano Akiko frequently wrote for the all-women literary magazine &quot;Seitō&quot; (Bluestocking), as well as other publications. Her opinions were rooted in the concept of equally partaking in child rearing, financial independence, and social responsibility.

===On financial independence===
Yosano Akiko disagreed with the concept of mothers seeking financial independence through the help of the government, claiming that dependence on the state and dependence on men are one and the same. In her essay titled &quot;Woman&#x27;s Complete Independence,&quot; or &quot;Joshi no tettei shita dokuritsu&quot; (女性の徹底した独立), she says:

This viewpoint was diametrically opposed to many Japanese feminists&#x27; shared opinion at the time that the government should financially support mothers, including one of the five founders of &quot;Seitō&quot;, Raichō Hiratsuka. Raichō criticized this, saying that most women cannot realistically live without financial assistance.

===On motherhood===
Despite giving birth to thirteen children in her lifetime, Yosano stated that she did not consider the act of giving birth to be the main part of her identity. She also expressed worry that fully equating the identity of womanhood with motherhood prioritizes motherhood over the other aspects of a person.

&quot;Akiko had, in effect, redefined the meaning of the term and seized it as a tool of liberation. &quot;Chastity&quot; no longer meant safeguarding the womb; it meant the totality of a woman&#x27;s sexuality, the totality of the female self, the chastity of the self. Akiko saw that the emphasis on woman as sexual object and her acceptance of that definition had had a stultifying effect on her sense of self&quot;

This was written in response to Swedish feminist Ellen Key and Leo Tolstoy in her &quot;Taiyō&quot; magazine column, &quot;One Woman&#x27;s Notebook,&quot; in January 1915. Her main assertion is that women could accept roles as mothers, but exemplified more than that role: as friends, as wives, as Japanese citizens, and as members of the world.

Yosano believed that motherhood is something that shouldn&#x27;t be controlled by the government, as even in a feminist light, there is no real difference from living for a man. She believed that marriage and life should be done cooperatively, and that living with one gender over the other would have “tragic consequences” for all involved.

==Turn to the right==
During the Taishō period, Yosano turned her attention to social commentary, with &quot;Hito oyobi Onna to shite&quot; (As a Human and as a Woman), &quot;Gekido no Naka o Iku&quot; (Going through Turbulent Times) and her autobiography &quot;Akarumi e&quot; (To the Light). In 1931, Yosano, Japan&#x27;s most famous pacifist succumbed to the &quot;war fever&quot; that gripped Japan when the Kwantung Army seized Manchuria. In a poem from 1932, &quot;Rosy-Cheeked Death&quot; concerning the First Battle of Shanghai, Yosano supported her country against China, though she also portrayed the Chinese soldiers killed in the battle as victims, albeit only of Chiang Kai-shek, who she accused of betraying the legacy of Dr. Sun Yet-sen, who always preached Sino-Japanese friendship. In &quot;Rosy-Cheeked Death&quot;, the Chinese are &quot;foolish&quot; to resist Japan because Japan is a &quot;good neighbor&quot; whom they could never hope to defeat, making their resistance futile.

In her poem &quot;Citizens of Japan, A Morning Song&quot; published in June 1932, Yosano embraced &quot;Bushido&quot; as she praised a Japanese soldier for dying for the Emperor at the First Battle of Shanghai as she described how the soldier &quot;scatters&quot; his body when he is blown apart as a &quot;human bomb&quot;. Yosano called the &quot;scattered&quot; body of the soldier &quot;purer than a flower, giving life to a samurai&#x27;s honor&quot;. Unlike the &quot;Kimi&quot;, Yosano called for Japanese women to &quot;unify in loyalty&quot; for the &quot;cause of the Emperor&#x27;s forces&quot;. The American scholar Steven Robson noted that unlike the &quot;Kimi&quot;, which like the rest of Yosano&#x27;s early poetry was extremely innovative, &quot;Citizens of Japan&quot; is cliche-ridden as Yosano used well-known phrases like &quot;a samurai&#x27;s honor&quot; taken straight from the ultra-nationalist press without developing a vocabulary of her own. Yosano ended her poem by praising &quot;Bushido&quot;, declaring that the &quot;purest&quot; act a Japanese man could perform was to die for the Emperor in battle and urged the Kwantung Army forward onward in the conquest of Manchuria &quot;through suffering a hundredfold&quot; to &quot;smash the sissified dreams of compromise&quot;.

Yosano&#x27;s poems from 1937 onward support the war against China, and in 1941, she supported war against the United States and the United Kingdom. Her late commentaries in the early Showa years tended to praise militarism, and also promoted her feminist viewpoints. Her final work, &quot;Shin Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; (New Man&#x27;yōshū, 1937–39) was a compilation of 26,783 poems by 6,675 contributors, written over a 60-year period.

In 1942, in one of her last poems, Yosano praised her son who was serving as a lieutenant in the Imperial Navy, urging him to &quot;fight bravely&quot; for the Emperor in &quot;this sacred war&quot;. Yosano died of a stroke in 1942 at the age of 63. Her death, occurring in the middle of the Pacific War, went almost unnoticed in the press, and after the end of the war, her works were largely forgotten by critics and the public. In the 1950s, the &quot;Kimi&quot; was made mandatory reading in Japanese high schools, and during the protests led by idealistic university students against the government of Nobusuke Kishi, whose intention was to do away with Article 9 of the constitution, the &quot;Kimi&quot; became something of an anthem for the students. Her romantic, sensual style has come back into popularity in recent years, and she has an ever-increasing following. Her grave is at Tama Cemetery in Fuchu, Tokyo.

<text>Daniele Comboni, MCCJ (15 March 1831 – 10 October 1881) was an Italian Catholic prelate who served as Vicar Apostolic of Central Africa from 1877 until his death in 1881. He worked in the missions in Africa and was the founder of both the Comboni Missionaries of the Heart of Jesus and the Comboni Missionary Sisters.

Comboni studied under Nicola Mazza in Verona where he became a multi-linguist and in 1849 vowed to join the missions in the African continent although this did not occur until 1857 when he travelled to Sudan. He continued to travel back and forth from his assignment to his native land in order to found his congregations and attend to other matters, and returned in 1870 for the First Vatican Council in Rome until its premature closing due to conflict.

Comboni attempted to draw attention across Europe to the plight of the people living in poverty-stricken areas in the African continent and from 1865 until mid-1865 travelled across Europe to places such as London and Paris to collect funds for a project he started to tend to the poor and ill. His mission to Africa was strengthened with his appointment as a bishop in 1877 for it allowed him greater freedom to establish branches of his order in Khartoum and Cairo amongst other locations.

Comboni was beatified by Pope John Paul II in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica on 17 March 1996 and his canonization came on 5 October 2003.

== Life ==

=== Birth and ordination ===

Daniele Comboni was born on 15 March 1831 at Limone sul Garda in Brescia to the poor gardeners (working for a local proprietor) Luigi Comboni and Domenica Pace as the fourth of eight children; he was the sole child to survive into adulthood. At that time Limone was under the jurisdiction of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.

At the age of twelve, he was sent to school in Verona on 20 February 1843 at the Religious Institute of Verona, founded by Nicola Mazza. It was there that he completed his studies in medicine and languages (he learnt French, English and Arabic) and prepared to become a priest. On 6 January 1849 he vowed that he would join the African missions, a desire he had held since 1846 after reading about the Japanese martyrs. On 31 December 1854 in Trento he received his ordination to the priesthood from the Bishop of Trent, Johann Nepomuk von Tschiderer zu Gleifheim. Comboni made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land from 29 September to 14 October 1855. In 1857 – with the blessing of his mother – he left for Africa along with five other missionaries, also former students of Mazza. His mother gave him her blessing and said to him: &quot;Go, Daniele, and may the Lord bless you&quot;. He departed on 8 September 1857 with Giovanni Beltrame, Alessandro dal Bosco, Francesco Oliboni, Angelo Melotto and Isidoro Zilli who hailed from Udine.

=== Missionary ===
Four months later, on 8 January 1858 he reached Khartoum in Sudan. His assignment was the liberation of enslaved boys and girls. There were difficulties including an unbearable climate and sickness as well as the deaths of several of his fellow missionaries; this, added with the poor and derelict conditions that the population faced made the situation all the more difficult. He had written to his parents of the conditions and the difficulties that the group faced but remained resolved. He witnessed the death of one of his companions and instead of deterring him he remained determined to continue and wrote: &quot;O Nigrizia o morte!&quot; (translation: &quot;Either Africa or death&quot;). By the end of 1859 three of the five had died and two were in Cairo as Comboni himself grew ill. Comboni was in his new surroundings from 1858 until 15 January 1859 when he was forced to return to Verona due a bout of malaria. He taught at Mazza&#x27;s institute from 1861 until 1864. He soon worked out fresh strategies for the missions while back in his native land in 1864. He visited Saint Peter&#x27;s tomb in Rome on 15 September 1864 and it was while reflecting before the tomb that he came upon the idea of a &quot;Plan for the Rebirth of Africa&quot; which was a project with the slogan &quot;Save Africa through Africa&quot;. Four days later, on 19 September, he met with Pope Pius IX to discuss his project.

Comboni wanted the European continent and the Universal Church to be more concerned with the African continent. He carried out appeals throughout Europe from December 1864 to June 1865 for spiritual and material aid for the African missions from people including monarchical families as well as bishops and nobles. Travelling under an Austrian consular visa, he went to France and Spain before heading north to England and then setting off to Germany and Austria. The humanitarian &quot;Society of Cologne&quot; became a main supporter of his work. It was around this time that he launched a magazine – the first in his homeland to delve into the missions for it was designed to be an exclusive magazine for those in the missions.

He established a male institute on 1 June 1867 and one for women in 1872 both in Verona: the Istituto delle Missioni per la Nigrizia (since 1894 the Comboni Missionaries of the Heart of Jesus) and the Istituto delle Pie Madri (later the Comboni Missionary Sisters) on 1 January 1872. On 7 May 1867 he had an audience with Pope Pius IX and brought with him twelve African girls to meet the pope while in late 1867 opened two branches of the order in Cairo. Comboni was the first to bring women into this form of work in Africa and he founded new missions in El Obeid and Delen amongst other Sudanese cities. Comboni was well-versed in the Arabic language and also spoke in several African dialects (Dinka, Bari and Nubia) as well as six European languages. On 2 April 1868 he was decorated with the Order of the Knight of Italy but he refused this in fidelity to Pius IX. On 7 July 1868 he left for France where he visited the shrine of La Salette on 26 July before heading to Germany and Austria. On 20 February 1869 he left Marseilles for Cairo where he opened a third house on 15 March.

Among Comboni&#x27;s early companions during his early years in Africa was Catarina Zenab, a Dinka who would go on to serve as a missionary in Khartoum later in her life.

=== Episcopate and death ===
On 9 March 1870 he left Cairo for Rome and arrived there on 15 March where he took part in the First Vatican Council as the theologian of the Bishop of Verona Luigi di Canossa; he formulated the &quot;Postulatum pro Nigris Africæ Centralis&quot; on 24 June which was a petition for the evangelization of Africa; this received the signature of 70 bishops. The First Vatican Council was terminated due to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War and the dissolution of the Papal States before the document could be discussed. In mid-1877 he was named as the Vicar Apostolic of Central Africa and received his episcopal consecration on 12 August 1877 from Cardinal Alessandro Franchi. His episcopal appointment was seen as a confirmation that his ideas and his activities – which some deemed to be foolish – were recognised as an effective means for the proclamation of the Gospel. In 1877 and again in 1878 there was a drought in the region of the mission while mass starvation ensued soon after. The local population was halved and the religious personnel and their activities reduced almost to nothing.

On 27 November 1880 he traveled to the missions in Sudan from Naples for the eighth and final time to act against the slave trade and though ill, managed to arrive in Khartoum on 9 August in summer and made a trip to the Nubia mountains. On 10 October 1881 he died in Khartoum during the cholera epidemic at 10:00pm; he had suffered a high fever since 5 October. His final words were reported to be: &quot;I am dying, but my work will not die&quot;. Pope Leo XIII mourned the loss of the bishop as a &quot;great loss&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Bishop Antonio Maria Roveggio (1850–1902) served as the order&#x27;s superior sometime after Comboni died. The male order received the papal decree of praise on 7 June 1895 and full papal approval from Pope Pius X on 19 February 1910. As of 2018, the men&#x27;s order operates in about twenty-eight countries, including Egypt, Sudan, Eritrea, Brazil, Colombia, and the Philippines. The female order received the decree of praise on 22 February 1897 and papal approval on 10 June 1912 while in 2008 there were 1529 religious in 192 houses. That order operates in Europe in countries such as the United Kingdom, in Africa in nations such as Cameroon and Mozambique, in the Americas in countries such as Costa Rica and Ecuador and in Asia in countries such as Israel and Jordan.

== Sainthood ==

The canonization cause started with an informative process in Verona that Bishop Girolamo Cardinale oversaw from 14 February 1928 until 21 November 1929 while Bishop Paolo Tranquillo Silvestri oversaw another informative process in Khartoum from 6 February 1929 until 7 June 1929. The postulation later compiled a Positio dossier and sent it to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 1982 while theologians approved his writings as being in line with the magisterium on 3 May 1982; historians also approved the cause later on 21 February 1989 after having deemed that no historical obstacles existed in relation to the cause. Six theologians approved the dossier on 12 October 1993 while the C.C.S. validated the two informative processes on 5 November 1993 prior to the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members approving the cause on 14 December 1993. On 26 March 1994 the confirmation of his life of heroic virtue enabled Pope John Paul II to title him as Venerable.

The miracle required for Comboni to be beatified was investigated on a diocesan level in São Mateus from 10 December 1990 until 29 June 1992 before it received C.C.S. validation on 30 April 1993. The miracle was 25 December 1970 healing of the Afro-Brazilian child Maria Giuseppa Oliveira Paixão who underwent a stomach surgical procedure for an infection that grew worse over time. But their attention turned to Comboni&#x27;s intercession and she was healed the next morning in a case that surprised the doctor. The seven medical experts approved that science could not explain this cure on 9 June 1994 while six theologians agreed likewise on 22 November 1994 as did the C.C.S. members on 24 January 1995. John Paul II confirmed on 6 April 1995 that this healing was indeed a miracle and beatified Comboni in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica on 17 March 1996.

The miracle required for him to be sainted was investigated in Khartoum from 9 to 28 May 2001 and received C.C.S. validation on 3 September 2001 before a medical panel approved it on 11 April 2002; the theologians followed suit on 6 September 2002 as did the C.C.S. on 15 October 2002. John Paul II confirmed this miracle on 20 December 2002 and scheduled the date for Comboni&#x27;s canonization in a papal consistory held on 20 February 2003; the pope canonized Comboni in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square on 5 October 2003. The miracle in question was the healing of the Muslim mother Lubana Abdel Aziz (b. 1965) who – on 11 November 1997 – was admitted into a Khartoum hospital for a caesarean section; the hospital was one that the Comboni Missionary Sisters managed. The infant was born but the mother suffered from repeated bleeding and other serious problems and was at the point of death on 13 November despite a blood transfusion. The doctors were pessimistic about her chances but the nuns prayed a novena to Comboni. The woman did not die, defying expectations, and was discharged from the hospital, completely recovered, on 18 November.

<doc id="344534" wikidata="Q1186931" url="?curid=344534" title="Sakuzō Yoshino">
<text>was a Japanese academic, historian, author and professor of political science.

Yoshino was active as a political thinker in the Taishō period. He is best known for his formulation of the theory of &quot;Minponshugi,&quot; or politics of the people.

==Biography==
Yoshino was born in Miyagi prefecture in 1878, and entered into Miyagi-Jinjo elementary school (Present-day Sendai Daiichi High School) in 1895. In 1898 he converted to Protestant Christianity. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in 1904. In 1906 he went to China as a private tutor for the son of Yuan Shikai, the then dominant Chinese politician. He returned in 1909 and took a position teaching political history and theory in the Faculty of Law at Tokyo Imperial University until 1924. In 1910, he went abroad for three years to study in Germany, Britain and the United States. On his return he began to write articles discussing the problems of implementing democratic government in Japan, such as political corruption and universal suffrage. He published his most famous essays in the noted literary magazine &quot;Chūōkōron&quot;. Arguably his most significant work, &quot;On the Meaning of Constitutional Government,&quot; was written in response to the popular belief in the superiority of the Prussian pattern. In it, Yoshino argued that democracy was compatible with the concept of the emperor&#x27;s sovereignty. Yoshino also served as the editor of &quot;Taiyō&quot;, a well-known literary and general interest magazine.

In December 1918, Yoshino joined with others to establish Reimeikai which was a society &quot;to propagate ideas of democracy among the people.&quot; This group was formed in order to sponsor public lectures.

<text>was the pen-name of , a Japanese author noted for his poetry in pre-World War II Japan. 

==Life==
Wakayama was born in Togo, Miyazaki, (now part of the city of Hyūga) as the eldest son of a doctor. He became interested in poetry from middle school, taking the name of &quot;Bokusui&quot; from the age of 18. He entered Waseda University in 1904, where one of his classmates was Hakushu Kitahara. After graduation, he was hired by the &quot;Chuo Shimbun&quot; newspaper in 1909, but quit after only five months. 

He decided to devote himself to poetry, and became a disciple of Saishū Onoe. He traveled all over Japan and Korea, composing many &quot;tanka&quot; about the places he visited. He settled in Numazu, Shizuoka in 1920. He also loved sake, and heavy drinking eventually resulted in cirrhosis of the liver. He died in 1928.

Before he died he wrote a death haiku that reads:

<doc id="344536" wikidata="Q157661" url="?curid=344536" title="Hepatitis A">
<text>Hepatitis A is an infectious disease of the liver caused by &quot;Hepatovirus A&quot; (HAV); it is a type of viral hepatitis. Many cases have few or no symptoms, especially in the young. The time between infection and symptoms, in those who develop them, is two–six weeks. When symptoms occur, they typically last eight weeks and may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain. Around 10–15% of people experience a recurrence of symptoms during the 6 months after the initial infection. Acute liver failure may rarely occur, with this being more common in the elderly.

It is usually spread by eating food or drinking water contaminated with infected feces. Undercooked or raw shellfish are relatively common sources. It may also be spread through close contact with an infectious person. While children often do not have symptoms when infected, they are still able to infect others. After a single infection, a person is immune for the rest of their life. Diagnosis requires blood testing, as the symptoms are similar to those of a number of other diseases. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.

The hepatitis A vaccine is effective for prevention.
 Some countries recommend it routinely for children and those at higher risk who have not previously been vaccinated. It appears to be effective for life. Other preventive measures include hand washing and properly cooking food. No specific treatment is available, with rest and medications for nausea or diarrhea recommended on an as-needed basis. Infections usually resolve completely and without ongoing liver disease. Treatment of acute liver failure, if it occurs, is with liver transplantation.

Globally, around 1.4 million symptomatic cases occur each year and about 114 million infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic). It is more common in regions of the world with poor sanitation and not enough safe water. In the developing world, about 90% of children have been infected by age 10, thus are immune by adulthood. It often occurs in outbreaks in moderately developed countries where children are not exposed when young and vaccination is not widespread. Acute hepatitis A resulted in 11,200 deaths in 2015. World Hepatitis Day occurs each year on July 28 to bring awareness to viral hepatitis.

==Signs and symptoms==
Early symptoms of &quot;hepatitis A&quot; infection can be mistaken for influenza, but some people, especially children, exhibit no symptoms at all. Symptoms typically appear two–six weeks (the incubation period) after the initial infection. About 90% of children do not have symptoms. The time between infection and symptoms, in those who develop them, is two–six weeks, with an average of 28 days.

The risk for symptomatic infection is directly related to age, with more than 80% of adults having symptoms compatible with acute viral hepatitis and the majority of children having either asymptomatic or unrecognized infections.

Symptoms usually last less than 2 months, although some people can be ill for as long as 6 months:
* Fatigue
* Fever
* Nausea
* Appetite loss
* Jaundice, a yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes owing to hyperbilirubinemia
* Bile is removed from the bloodstream and excreted in the urine, giving it a dark amber color
* Diarrhea
* Light or clay-colored faeces (acholic faeces)
* Abdominal discomfort

===Extrahepatic manifestations===
Joint pains, red cell aplasia, pancreatitis and generalized lymphadenopathy are the possible extrahepatic manifestations. Kidney failure and pericarditis are very uncommon. If they occur, they show an acute onset and disappear upon resolution of the disease.

==Virology==
===Taxonomy===
&quot;Hepatovirus A&quot; is a species of virus in the order &quot;Picornavirales&quot;, family &quot;Picornaviridae&quot;, genus &quot;Hepatovirus&quot;. Humans and other vertebrates serve as natural hosts of this genus.

Nine members of &quot;Hepatovirus&quot; are recognized. These species infect bats, rodents, hedgehogs, and shrews. Phylogenetic analysis suggests a rodent origin for human Hepatitis A.

A member virus of &quot;hepatovirus B&quot; (&quot;Phopivirus&quot;) has been isolated from a seal. This virus shared a common ancestor with &quot;Hepatovirus A&quot; about 1800 years ago.

Another hepatovirus – Marmota himalayana hepatovirus – has been isolated from the woodchuck &quot;Marmota himalayana&quot;. This virus appears to have had a common ancestor with the primate-infecting species around 1000 years ago.

===Genotypes===
One serotype and six different genotypes (three human and three simian) have been described. The human genotypes are numbered I–III. Six subtypes have been described (IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB). The simian genotypes have been numbered IV–VI. A single isolate of genotype VII isolated from a human has also been described but has been reclassified as subgenotype IIB. Genotype III has been isolated from both humans and owl monkeys. Most human isolates are of genotype I. Of genotype I isolates, subtype IA accounts for the majority.

The mutation rate in the genome has been estimated to be nucleotide substitutions per site per year. The human strains appear to have diverged from the simian about 3600 years ago. The mean age of genotypes III and IIIA strains has been estimated to be 592 and 202 years, respectively.

===Structure===

&quot;Hepatovirus A&quot; is a picornavirus; it is not enveloped and contains a positive-sense, single-strand of RNA packaged in a protein shell. Only one serotype of the virus has been found, but multiple genotypes exist. Codon use within the genome is biased and unusually distinct from its host. It also has a poor internal ribosome entry site. In the region that codes for the HAV capsid, highly conserved clusters of rare codons restrict antigenic variability.

===Replication cycle===
Vertebrates such as humans serve as the natural hosts. Transmission routes are fecal-oral and blood.

Following ingestion, HAV enters the bloodstream through the epithelium of the oropharynx or intestine. The blood carries the virus to its target, the liver, where it multiplies within hepatocytes and Kupffer cells (liver macrophages). Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the virus to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the positive-stranded RNA virus replication model. Translation takes place by viral initiation. The virus exits the host cell by lysis and viroporins. Virions are secreted into the bile and released in stool. HAV is excreted in large numbers about 11 days prior to the appearance of symptoms or anti-HAV IgM antibodies in the blood. The incubation period is 15–50 days and risk of death in those infected is less than 0.5%.

Within the liver hepatocytes, the RNA genome is released from the protein coat and is translated by the cell&#x27;s own ribosomes. Unlike other picornaviruses, this virus requires an intact eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) for the initiation of translation. The requirement for this factor results in an inability to shut down host protein synthesis, unlike other picornaviruses. The virus must then inefficiently compete for the cellular translational machinery, which may explain its poor growth in cell culture. Aragonès et al. (2010) theorize that the virus has evolved a naturally highly deoptimized codon usage with respect to that of its cellular host in order to negatively influence viral protein translation kinetics and allow time for capsid proteins to fold optimally.

No apparent virus-mediated cytotoxicity occurs, presumably because of the virus&#x27; own requirement for an intact eIF4G, and liver pathology is likely immune-mediated.

===Transmission===
The virus primarily spreads by the fecal–oral route, and infections often occur in conditions of poor sanitation and overcrowding. Hepatitis A can be transmitted by the parenteral route, but very rarely by blood and blood products. Food-borne outbreaks are common, and ingestion of shellfish cultivated in polluted water is associated with a high risk of infection. HAV can also be spread through sexual contact, specifically oro–anal and digital–rectal sexual acts. Humans are the only natural reservoir and disease vector of the HAV virus; no known insect or other animal vectors can transmit the virus. A chronic HAV state has not been reported.

About 40% of all acute viral hepatitis is caused by HAV. Infected individuals are infectious prior to onset of symptoms, roughly 10 days following infection. The virus is resistant to detergent, acid (pH 1), solvents (e.g., ether, chloroform), drying, and temperatures up to 60 °C. It can survive for months in fresh and salt water. Common-source (e.g., water, food) outbreaks are typical. Infection is common in children in developing countries, reaching 100% incidence, but following infection, lifelong immunity results. HAV can be inactivated by chlorine treatment (drinking water), formalin (0.35%, 37 °C, 72 hours), peracetic acid (2%, 4 hours), beta-propiolactone (0.25%, 1 hour), and UV radiation (2 μW/cm2/min).

In developing countries, and in regions with poor hygiene standards, the rates of infection with this virus are high and the illness is usually contracted in early childhood. As incomes rise and access to clean water increases, the incidence of HAV decreases. In developed countries, though, the infection is contracted primarily by susceptible young adults, most of whom are infected with the virus during trips to countries with a high incidence of the disease or through contact with infectious persons.

==Diagnosis==
Although HAV is excreted in the feces towards the end of the incubation period, specific diagnosis is made by the detection of HAV-specific IgM antibodies in the blood. IgM antibody is only present in the blood following an acute hepatitis A infection. It is detectable from 1–2 weeks after the initial infection and persists for up to 14 weeks. The presence of IgG antibodies in the blood means the acute stage of the illness has passed and the person is immune to further infection. IgG antibodies to HAV are also found in the blood following vaccination, and tests for immunity to the virus are based on the detection of these antibodies.

During the acute stage of the infection, the liver enzyme alanine transferase (ALT) is present in the blood at levels much higher than is normal. The enzyme comes from the liver cells damaged by the virus.

Hepatovirus A is present in the blood (viremia) and feces of infected people up to 2 weeks before clinical illness develops.

==Prevention==
Hepatitis A can be prevented by vaccination, good hygiene, and sanitation.

===Vaccination===
The two types of vaccines contain either inactivated &quot;Hepatovirus A&quot; or a live but attenuated virus. Both provide active immunity against a future infection. The vaccine protects against HAV in more than 95% of cases for longer than 25 years. In the United States, the vaccine developed by Maurice Hilleman and his team was licensed in 1995, and the vaccine was first used in 1996 for children in high-risk areas, and in 1999 it was spread to areas with elevating levels of infection.

The vaccine is given by injection. An initial dose provides protection lasting one year starting 2–4 weeks after vaccination; the second booster dose, given six to 12 months later, provides protection for over 20 years.

The vaccine was introduced in 1992 and was initially recommended for persons at high risk. Since then, Bahrain and Israel have embarked on elimination programmes. In countries where widespread vaccination has been practised, the incidence of hepatitis A has decreased dramatically.

In the United States, vaccination of children is recommended at 1 and 2 years of age; hepatitis A vaccination is not recommended in those younger than 12 months of age. It is also recommended in those who have not been previously immunized and who have been exposed or are likely to be exposed due to travel. The CDC recommends vaccination against infection for men who have sex with men.

==Treatment==
No specific treatment for hepatitis A is known. Recovery from symptoms following infection may take several weeks or months. Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhea.

==Prognosis==
In the United States in 1991, the mortality rate for hepatitis A was estimated to be 0.015% for the general population, but ranged up to 1.8–2.1% for those aged 50 and over who were hospitalized with icteric hepatitis. The risk of death from acute liver failure following HAV infection increases with age and when the person has underlying chronic liver disease.

Young children who are infected with hepatitis A typically have a milder form of the disease, usually lasting 1–3 weeks, whereas adults tend to experience a much more severe form of the disease.

==Epidemiology==

Globally, symptomatic HAV infections are believed to occur in around 1.4 million people a year. About 114 million infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic) occurred all together in 2015. Acute hepatitis A resulted in 11,200 deaths in 2015. Developed countries have low circulating levels of hepatovirus A, while developing countries have higher levels of circulation. Most adolescents and adults in developing countries have already had the disease, thus are immune. Adults in midlevel countries may be at risk of disease with the potential of being exposed.

===Countries===
Over 30,000 cases of hepatitis A were reported to the CDC in the US in 1997, but the number has since dropped to less than 2,000 cases reported per year.

The most widespread hepatitis A outbreak in the United States occurred in 2018, in the state of Kentucky. The outbreak is believed to have started in November 2017. By July 2018 48% of the state&#x27;s counties had reported at least one case of hepatitis A, and the total number of suspected cases was 969 with six deaths (482 cases in Louisville, Kentucky). By July 2019 the outbreak had reached 5,000 cases and 60 deaths, but had slowed to just a few new cases per month.

Another widespread outbreak in the United States, the 2003 US hepatitis outbreak, affected at least 640 people (killing four) in northeastern Ohio and southwestern Pennsylvania in late 2003. The outbreak was blamed on tainted green onions at a restaurant in Monaca, Pennsylvania. In 1988, more than 300,000 people in Shanghai, China, were infected with HAV after eating clams (&quot;Anadara subcrenata&quot;) from a contaminated river.
In June 2013, frozen berries sold by US retailer Costco and purchased by around 240,000 people were the subject of a recall, after at least 158 people were infected with HAV, 69 of whom were hospitalized. In April 2016, frozen berries sold by Costco were once again the subject of a recall, after at least 13 people in Canada were infected with HAV, three of whom were hospitalized. In Australia in February 2015, a recall of frozen berries was issued after at least 19 people contracted the illness following their consumption of the product. In 2017, California (particularly around San Diego), Michigan, and Utah reported outbreaks of hepatitis A that have led to over 800 hospitalizations and 40 deaths.

<text>Francesca McKnight Donatella Romana Gregorini di Savignano di Romagna (born August7, 1968), known professionally as Francesca Gregorini, is an Italian-American screenwriter and film director.

== Early life ==

Born in Rome, Gregorini is the daughter of former &quot;Bond girl&quot; Barbara Bach and businessman Augusto Gregorini Savignano di Romagna from Savignano sul Rubicone. Her mother (born Barbara Goldbach) is of Jewish and Irish descent. Gregorini is the stepdaughter of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr, with whom she is close. After boarding at TASIS, she attended Brown University graduating in 1990.

== Career ==

Gregorini contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the film &quot;See Jane Run&quot; (2001), in which she also had a small acting role. She worked as a musician with her first CD &quot;Sequel&quot; (2003), where she sings, and plays the guitar and bass.

Gregorini sold scripts to both HBO and Paramount Pictures before co-helming, with Princess Tatiana von Fürstenberg, her directorial debut &quot;Tanner Hall&quot;, a coming of age story set in an all-girls boarding school in Rhode Island, starring Rooney Mara. Gregorini and von Fürstenberg also co-wrote the independent film, loosely based on their own adolescent experiences. Gregorini said in an interview, &quot;Naturally there are some autobiographical elements, combined with things we&#x27;d witness in boarding school, and many other parts that we made up completely. You will certainly find characteristics of both of us in each of the four main girls and if you spend even a half-hour with us, it will be very apparent to you, which girls are most like me and which ones are most like Tatiana.&quot; The film was an official selection at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival.

Gregorini&#x27;s film &quot;The Truth About Emanuel&quot;starring Jessica Biel, Kaya Scodelario and Alfred Molinawas selected for the US dramatic competition at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.

In summer 2018, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that &quot;Killing Eve&quot; creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge hired Gregorini as a director for the show&#x27;s second series.

In January 2020, Francesca Gregorini filed a lawsuit against &quot;Servant&quot; producers including Tony Basgallop and M. Night Shyamalan, the production companies involved, and Apple TV+, alleging copyright infringement for her 2013 drama film, The &quot;Truth About Emanuel&quot;. Basgallop and Shyamalan responded that neither had seen her film and that any similarity is coincidence. On May 28, 2020, a federal judge threw out the copyright lawsuit against Shyamalan and Apple, ruling that the TV show is not similar enough to the film to merit a lawsuit. On July 21, 2020, the court ordered Gregorini to pay the defendants&#x27; attorneys&#x27; fees of $162,467.30. In February 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined that the lawsuit was dismissed prematurely, as the discovery steps had not been properly carried out, ruling &quot;&#x27;reasonable minds could differ&#x27; on whether the stories are substantially similar.&quot; In 2025, a federal jury ruled unanimously in the defendants&#x27; favor.

== Personal life ==
Gregorini was in a relationship with actress Portia de Rossi from 2000 to 2004. Since January 2014, she has been dating producer Morgan Marling, sister of actress Brit Marling.

<text>Cao Huan () (246 – 302/303), courtesy name Jingming, was the fifth and last emperor of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. On 4 February 266, he abdicated the throne in favour of regent Sima Yan (later Emperor Wu of the Jin dynasty), and brought an end to the Wei regime. After his abdication, Cao Huan was granted the title &quot;Prince of Chenliu&quot; and held it until his death, after which he was posthumously honoured as &quot;Emperor Yuan (of Cao Wei)&quot;.

==Family background and accession to the throne==
Cao Huan&#x27;s birth name was &quot;Cao Huang&quot; (). His father, Cao Yu, the Prince of Yan, was a son of Cao Cao, the father of Wei&#x27;s first emperor, Cao Pi. In 258, at the age of 12, in accordance with Wei&#x27;s regulations that the sons of princes (other than the first-born son of the prince&#x27;s spouse or wife, customarily designated the prince&#x27;s heir) were to be instated as dukes, Cao Huan was instated as the &quot;Duke of Changdao District&quot; ().

In June 260, after the ruling emperor Cao Mao was killed in an attempt to seize back state power from the regent Sima Zhao, Cao Huang was selected to succeed Cao Mao.

==Reign==
At the time Cao Huang became emperor, his name was changed to &quot;Cao Huan&quot; because it was difficult to observe naming taboo with the name &quot;Huang&quot; (which was a homonym to many common terms—including &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;emperor&quot; ). During Cao Huan&#x27;s reign, the Sima clan controlled state power and Cao was merely a figurehead and head of state in name. On 28 Nov 263, Cao Huan instated his wife Lady Bian as empress.

For the first few years of Cao Huan&#x27;s reign, there were constant attacks by forces from the rival Shu Han state under the command of Shu general Jiang Wei. While Jiang Wei&#x27;s attacks were largely easily repelled, Sima Zhao eventually ordered a counterattack on Shu with an invading force of 180,000 men commanded by Zhong Hui and Deng Ai. In late 263, Liu Shan, then Shu emperor, surrendered to Deng, bringing an end to the state of Shu. After the fall of Shu, Deng Ai was framed for treason by Zhong Hui and stripped of command. In early 264, Zhong Hui plotted with Jiang Wei to restore Shu and eliminate all the Wei generals who might oppose him. However, the generals started a counterinsurgency and killed Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei. Shu&#x27;s former territories (in present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, southern Shaanxi, and southeastern Gansu) were completely annexed by Wei.

==Abdication and later life==
Wei itself did not last much longer after Shu&#x27;s collapse. In December 263, Sima Zhao again forced Cao Huan to grant him the nine bestowments and this time he finally accepted, signifying that a usurpation was near; at the same time he was also made Duke of Jin. In May 264, Sima Zhao became a vassal king under the title &quot;King of Jin&quot; — the final step before usurpation. After Sima Zhao died in September 265, his son, Sima Yan, inherited his father&#x27;s position and on 4 February 266 forced Cao Huan to abdicate. Two days later, Cao Huan was located to Ye city, where he would live for the rest of his life. Sima Yan then established the Jin dynasty on 8 February. He granted Cao Huan the title &quot;Prince of Chenliu&quot; which Cao Huan carried until his death.

Not much is known about Cao Huan&#x27;s life as a prince under Jin rule. Sima Yan (later known as Emperor Wu of Jin) permitted him to retain imperial banners and wagons and to worship ancestors with imperial ceremonies. He also permitted Cao Huan not to refer to himself as a subject of his. He died in 302 during the reign of Emperor Wu&#x27;s son, Emperor Hui. He was buried with honours due an emperor and given the posthumous name &quot;Yuan&quot; by the Jin court.

It is not known who immediately succeeded Cao Huan as Prince of Chenliu, but in November or December 326, the title of Prince of Chenliu was conferred upon Cao Mai, a great-great-grandson of Cao Cao, who held the title until his death on 1 December 358. He was succeeded by his son, Cao Hui, whose title was confirmed on 24 November 363. The title of Prince of Chenliu would remain within the Cao clan until it was abolished on 25 September 479 during the reign of Xiao Daocheng, founding emperor of Southern Qi; the final Prince of Chenliu was Cao Can (曹粲).

<text>The East River Mountain Tunnel is a vehicular tunnel that carries Interstate 77 (I-77) and U.S. Route 52 (US 52) through East River Mountain between Bluefield, West Virginia, and Rocky Gap, Virginia.

==History==
Construction began on August 12, 1969, and it opened on December 20, 1974. At a cost of $40 million (equivalent to $ in ), it was the most expensive construction project undertaken by the West Virginia Division of Highways at the time. The northern 51% of the tunnel is in West Virginia and the southern 49% in Virginia; Virginia shared the cost of the project.

Before the opening of the East River Mountain Tunnel, travelers wishing to cross the state line had to navigate the narrow, twisting, guardrail-less route of US 52 up and over the mountain (now designated as SR 598 and WV 598). When fog or snow was present, the journey became arduous, and the road was occasionally closed completely (particularly in the winter months) due to treacherous conditions.
==Location==

The tunnel is located about north of its shorter cousin, the Big Walker Mountain Tunnel. The East River Mountain Tunnel is one of two land vehicular tunnels in the United States that cross a state line, the other being the Cumberland Gap Tunnel.

The top of East River Mountain can be seen in the distance from Big Walker Lookout, a observation tower built on Big Walker Mountain.

<text>Kenenisa Bekele Beyecha (; ; born 13 June 1982) is an Ethiopian long-distance runner. He was the world record holder in both the 5,000-metre and 10,000-metre from 2004 until 2020. He won the gold medal in both the 5,000 m and 10,000 m events at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. At the 2004 Olympics, he won the gold medal in the 10,000 m and the silver medal in the 5,000 m.

He is the most successful runner in the history of the IAAF World Cross Country Championships, with six long (12 km) course and five short (4 km) course titles. He won the 10,000 m title at the World Championships in Athletics in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009 (matching Haile Gebrselassie&#x27;s four in a row win streak). Kenenisa was unbeaten over 10,000 m from his debut in 2003 until 2011, when he failed to finish at the World Championships final.

At the 2009 World Championships in Athletics he became the first man to win both 5000 m and 10,000 m title at the same championships. Over 5000 m he has also won an Olympic silver (2004), World Championship bronze (2003), two African Championship titles and one All-Africa Games gold medal. He also won the 3000 metres title at the 2006 World Indoor Championships.

On 6 April 2014, he produced the sixth fastest marathon debut ever on a record-eligible course with his victory at the Paris Marathon, in a course record time of 2:05:04. On 25 September 2016, Kenenisa won the Berlin Marathon in a time of 2:03:03, a new personal best, then the third-fastest marathon of all time. On 29 September 2019, he again won the Berlin Marathon in a time of 2:01:41, two seconds slower than the then world record of 2:01:39 set by Eliud Kipchoge in the 2018 Berlin Marathon. Considering his accomplishments in cross country, track, and road racing, many consider him to be the greatest distance runner of all time.

== Early life ==
Kenenisa Bekele was born in 1982 in Bekoji in the Arsi Zone of Oromia Region, the same town as several other prominent long-distance runners, including the Dibaba&#x27;s Daughters (Ejegayehu, Tirunesh and Genzebe) and their cousin Derartu Tulu. Kenenisa was born the second child to parents who made a living as barley farmers, along with three brothers and two sisters. The family practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity.

Kenenisa initially aspired to a career in medicine, education, or the civil service. He began to train seriously in running with the encouragement of a physical education teacher, while drawing inspiration from the success of Derartu Tulu and Haile Gebrselassie. Kenenisa achieved his first medals at an international competition with second place finishes in both the 3000 metres of the 1999 World Youth Championships and the 5000 metres of the 2000 World Junior Championships. He won his first gold medal in the junior race of the 2001 World Cross Country Championships. His success in running enabled him to purchase a house and to help fund his siblings&#x27; educations.

== Running career ==

=== 2001 – 2003: Early career ===
In August 2001, Kenenisa set a 3000 metres world junior record by running 7:30.67 minutes in Brussels. The record lasted for three and a half years, being broken by Augustine Choge with a run of 7:28.78 minutes. In December 2000 and 2001 Kenenisa won the 15k roadrace Montferland Run in the Netherlands. For five years in a row, from 2002 (at the age of 19) through 2006, he took both short (4 km) and long (12 km) races at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships, a feat no other runner has accomplished even once. After the IAAF eliminated the short course race in 2007, Kenenisa won a final long course race in 2008, bringing his World Cross Country medal totals to 11 senior individual gold medals (6 long course, 5 short course), 1 senior silver medal (2001), 1 junior gold medal (2001), 2 team gold medals (2004, 2005), 3 team silver medals (2002, 2003, &amp; 2008), and 1 team bronze medal (2006) for a grand total of 19 medals.

Kenenisa became known for his ability to accelerate very quickly at the end of a long-distance race; in Oslo in June 2003, he chased after Kenyan Abraham Chebii and won the race in 12:52.26. He has faced fellow Ethiopian, Haile Gebrselassie, twice in road competition, once in cross country, and six times on the track. Haile defeated Kenenisa on the track in the 2000 Nurnberg 5000 metres, the 2001 Great Ethiopian Run 10 km, and the Cross de l&#x27;Acier in December 2001, but lost to Kenenisa in Hengelo 2003 over 10,000 m (26:53 to 26:54), Rome 2003 over 5000 m (12:57 to 13:00), Paris 2003 World Championships over 10,000 m (26:49 to 26:50), Athens 2004 Olympic Games (27:05 to 27:27), in the 10,000 m in the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games (27:01 to 27:06), and in the Great North Run half marathon in September 2013 (60:09 to 60:41).

=== 2004 season ===
In 2004, Kenenisa broke the world records for the indoor 5000 m, outdoor 5000 m and outdoor 10,000 m (both in a timeframe of 9 days). He won the short and long course world cross country titles, leading Ethiopia to the senior men&#x27;s team title. He also won a gold medal in the men&#x27;s 10,000 metres and a silver medal in the men&#x27;s 5000 metres in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.

=== 2005 season ===
On 4 January 2005, Kenenisa&#x27;s fiancée, 18-year-old Alem Techale, died of an apparent heart attack while on a training run with him. Although it was initially stated that no autopsy was performed, Alem&#x27;s and Kenenisa&#x27;s manager Jos Hermens later said that an autopsy had revealed nothing conclusive about Techale&#x27;s death. She was the 2003 World Youth Champion in the 1500 metres and in excellent physical condition.

He resumed racing on 29 January, and lost indoors over 3000 m to Ireland&#x27;s Alistair Cragg after sprinting towards the line with one and a half laps to go, while thinking that there was only half a lap left. A few weeks later he lost to fellow Ethiopian Markos Geneti over two miles.

In March, Kenenisa lined up to defend his long and short course titles at the 2005 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. He won on the short course despite a fast pace set by Qatari Saif Saaeed Shaheen, and followed that win with a long course victory the next day over Eritrean Zersenay Tadese and Kenyan rival Eliud Kipchoge.

On 8 August 2005, Kenenisa Bekele won the gold medal in the 10,000 m at the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki with a last 200 m spurt. On 26 August 2005, Kenenisa set the 10,000 m world record 26:17.53 at the 29th Memorial Van Damme meeting in Brussels, slicing nearly three seconds off his previous world record 26:20.31, and running with 5000 m splits of 13:09 and 13:08 minutes. The race saw 6 runners finishing in less than 27 minutes, with Sammy Wanjiru dipping in 26:41.75, a new world junior record. At the end of 2005 Kenenisa was voted the&quot; Track &amp; Field News&quot; magazine athlete of the year for the second year in a row.

===2006–2007===

When Kenenisa won the 3000 m at the 2006 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Moscow, he became the first athlete in history to be Olympic champion, world outdoor track champion, world indoor track champion, and world cross country champion. In 2006 he won five out of six IAAF Golden League events (5000 m) in the same season, which earned him a total of US$83,333.

On 17 February 2007, he broke the indoor world record over 2000 m in Birmingham, with a time of 4:49.99. His spectacular final 300 m aided this time which would be considered excellent even outdoors. On 24 March 2007, however, his streak of 27 consecutive victories in cross country races (dating back to his last previous loss in December 2001) came to an end when after leading the race in the penultimate lap of the 2007 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Mombasa he succumbed to the very hot, humid conditions (which caused more than 1/6 of all competitors to drop out) and was passed by eventual winner Zersenay Tadese on the last lap before Kenenisa dropped out. This was greeted with cheers by the Kenyan crowds, an occurrence which has been frowned upon by the wider athletics community.

He recovered from that rare failure to take the 10,000-metre title at the 2007 IAAF World Championships in Osaka, once again besting his compatriot Sileshi Sihine. During that race, he looked like he was going to be dropped several times over the last 800 metres, but recovered to overtake Sileshi with 150 metres to go and take his third straight world title.

===2008: Beijing Olympics ===

In Edinburgh on 30 March 2008, he won his sixth World Cross Country title (long course – 12k), breaking the three-way tie of 5 wins he had previously shared with Paul Tergat and John Ngugi. With this win, Kenenisa laid sole claim to most decorated athlete in IAAF World Cross Country Championships history. He has won 6 long course (12k) individual gold medals, 5 short course (4k) gold medals, 1 junior championship (8k), and 4 team gold medals for a sum total of 16 gold medals. His overall medal count (both individual and team results) stands at 27 medals: 16 gold, 9 silver and 2 bronze.

On 17 August 2008 Kenenisa won gold in the 10,000m finals with a time of 27:01.17, setting a new Olympic Record in the process. In a race in which 20 men broke the 28-minute barrier and four finished under his 2004 Olympic record of 27:05.10, he needed his renowned finishing kick to pull out the victory, running a 53.42-second final 400 metres (similar to the 53.02-second final 400-metre sprint he used to win the gold medal in Athens in 2004 over the same distance).

On 23 August 2008 Kenenisa bested his competitors and won the 5000-metre finals, shattering Saïd Aouita&#x27;s Olympic Record by almost eight seconds with a time of 12:57.82. The race was remarkable for his manner of doing most of the pacing himself before accelerating to a scintillating finish: his last 3000 metres only took 7:35.53, his final 2000 metres 4:56.97, last 1600 metres 3:57.01 (=3:58.4 final mile) and his final lap a punishing 53.87 seconds. By winning the 10,000/5000m double in the Beijing Olympics, Kenenisa joined another elite group of athletes: Hannes Kolehmainen (1912), Emil Zátopek (1952), Vladimir Kuts (1956), Lasse Virén (twice, in 1972 and 1976) and Miruts Yifter (1980).

=== 2009: Berlin World Championships ===
Kenenisa Bekele won two gold medals at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, held in Berlin. His double victories in 5000m (13:17.09) and 10,000m (26:46.31 – a World Championships Record) were unprecedented and by doing this became the first man to take both the long-distance track gold medals at the same World Championships. His talent combination of endurance and speed has made it nearly impossible to defeat Kenenisa when he is at full strength. During the 10,000m race in which he was running behind Eritrea&#x27;s Zersenay Tadesse, the broadcaster declared &quot;it is over, in fact it was over from the start&quot; as the final lap began and Kenenisa turned an ostensibly close race into a blowout. The IAAF announcer concluded, &quot;this man is probably the greatest distance runner we will ever see.&quot;

In spite of his unrivalled success in athletics, Kenenisa did not experience the mainstream appeal that others such as Haile Gebrselassie did. His quiet demeanour and aversion to interviews did not make him a highly marketable athlete in the Western world. Fellow world record holder Usain Bolt stated that Kenenisa Bekele&#x27;s achievements had not received the recognition that they deserved.

===2010: Injuries===

Kenenisa made a disappointing start to 2010, finishing fourth in the Edinburgh Cross Country in a race he was favored to win – a trio of Kenyan athletes ran him out of the contest over the final lap. He spent the entirety of the indoor and outdoor seasons out with a ruptured calf muscle.

===2011 World Championships and 2012 Olympics===
Kenenisa Bekele finally returned to training after a knee injury in March 2011. Having not raced on the track since 2009, Kenenisa returned for the World Championships. He dropped out of the 10,000m with 10 laps remaining. Kenenisa decided not to run the 5000 m and returned to the Diamond League at the Ivo Van Damme Memorial in Brussels where he set the fastest time in the world for the 10,000 metres in 2011.

Kenenisa&#x27;s 2012 season did not start well, as he was a lowly eleventh place at the Edinburgh Cross Country. In April, he appeared to have returned to form by winning the Great Ireland Run in a new personal best time for a 10 km road race of 27:49, improving the course record by 46 seconds.

In the 2012 London Olympics 10,000m race he ran within the leading group for the whole race, but could not keep up with the Mo Farah&#x27;s sprint in the last 150 metres and eventually finished fourth, with a time of 27:32.44, just 1.01 second outside the bronze medalist, his brother Tariku.

In his first race of 2013 he won the Great Ireland Run for a second time.
Kenenisa then won the Great North Run half marathon in a time of 60:09, beating Mo Farah by just one second after making a move that Farah couldn&#x27;t match with just less than 12 miles gone.

===Marathon career===
;2014 - 2015
Kenenisa Bekele started his marathon career in the 2014 Paris Marathon on 6 April 2014. His marathon debut was very successful as he bettered both the Paris course record and the debut marathon times of past legends Haile Gebrselassie, Paul Tergat and Samuel Wanjiru by running 2:05:04 to win. Kenenisa then went on to compete in the 2014 Chicago Marathon on 12 October 2014. He finished fourth in 2:05:51, 1min 40s behind Kenya&#x27;s Eliud Kipchoge. On 23 January 2015, Kenenisa took on the Dubai Marathon, where he had to retire from the race after 30 km. He was planned to compete in the 2015 London Marathon but had to withdraw due to a persistent injury to his right Achilles tendon.

Following 11 months of injury, Kenenisa returned to racing at the 2016 London Marathon. Prior to the race he indicated he was only currently at 90% fitness. Kenenisa finished in 3rd place behind winner Eliud Kipchoge and runner-up Stanley Biwott in a time of 2:06:36. This performance was despite the fact he only returned to jogging in early 2016 following injury and had only completed 6 weeks of specific marathon training. He was also hampered in the race by missing his drinks at 5 separate stations, due to them being used by the designated pacemakers.

;2016 - 2017
On 24 April, he placed third at the 2016 London Marathon with a time of two hours six minutes and 38 seconds. In September he won the 2016 Berlin Marathon in a time of 2:03:03 which set a new personal best time for him at the Marathon distance and the second fastest marathon of all time. On 19 January 2017, attempting to break the world record, Kenenisa dropped out of the Dubai Marathon after the half way mark due to a fall at the beginning of the race. On 23 April 2017, Kenenisa finished second in the London Marathon, finishing in 2:05:57, 9 seconds behind winner Daniel Wanjiru.

Kenenisa&#x27;s outstanding track career led to his involvement in a project to break the two-hour barrier for the marathon, though a number of factors undermined this effort.

;2018 - 2019
Kenenisa ran the 2018 London Marathon in April and came in sixth place with a time of 2:08:53. He also ran the Amsterdam marathon in October 2018 but dropped out due to injury with about 2 km to go. Kenenisa won the 2019 Berlin Marathon in September in 2:01:41, the second fastest time ever at the time and just two seconds off of the world record set by Eliud Kipchoge on the same course the previous year. After the run he stated that he still believes that he can break the world record.

;2020 - 2021
Kenenisa won the London half marathon on 1 March 2020 in 60:22. He improved on the course record set by Mo Farah in 2019 by 1:18. Chris Thompson came in second with 61:07, also within the former course record. Kenenisa returned to the Berlin Marathon in September, where he placed third in 2:06:47. The race was won by his compatriot Guye Adola in 2:05:45, while Kenya&#x27;s Bethwel Yegon finished second. In November, he finished six at the 2021 New York City Marathon with a time of 2:12:52.

;2022 - 2023
In September, he placed third at the Great North Run half marathon in a time of 1:01:01. The next month, Kenenisa competed in the 2022 London Marathon, finishing fifth in 2:05:53 to set a masters world record in age 40 group. In April, he took part in the London Marathon but withdrew from the race after 25k mark. Then, in October, he announced on Instagram that he had departed from the NN running team and transitioned his sponsorship from Nike to Anta, a Chinese sports brand. In December, Kenenisa took part in the Valencia Marathon. Although he fell behind the leading group before reaching the 15 km mark, he managed to finish fourth in a M40 Master World Record with a time of 2:04:19. This achievement solidifies him as the first athlete aged over 40 to complete a marathon in sub 2:05 clocking.

==== 2024 ====
The 41-year-old Kenenisa competed in the London Marathon on 21 April 2024, where he finished second behind Alexander Munyao breaking his own Masters record by 4 seconds running 2:04:15.
Kenenisa was selected to represent Ethiopia in the marathon at the 2024 Summer Olympics. At 41 years of age, it was his fourth Olympic appearance and first time competing at the event since the 2012 London Olympics. Kenenisa ended up finishing in 39th place with a time of 2:12:24

==Personal life==
On 18 November 2007, Kenenisa married Ethiopian film actress Danawit Gebregziabher in Addis Ababa. Kenenisa has one younger brother, Tariku Bekele, who is also an accomplished world-class distance runner.

<text>In number theory, given a positive integer &quot;n&quot; and an integer &quot;a&quot; coprime to &quot;n&quot;, the multiplicative order of &quot;a&quot; modulo &quot;n&quot; is the smallest positive integer &quot;k&quot; such that formula_1.

In other words, the multiplicative order of &quot;a&quot; modulo &quot;n&quot; is the order of &quot;a&quot; in the multiplicative group of the units in the ring of the integers modulo &quot;n&quot;.

The order of &quot;a&quot; modulo &quot;n&quot; is sometimes written as formula_2.

== Example ==

The powers of 4 modulo 7 are as follows:

: formula_3

The smallest positive integer &quot;k&quot; such that 4&quot;k&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 7) is 3, so the order of 4 (mod 7) is 3.

== Properties ==

Even without knowledge that we are working in the multiplicative group of integers modulo n, we can show that &quot;a&quot; actually has an order by noting that the powers of &quot;a&quot; can only take a finite number of different values modulo &quot;n&quot;, so according to the pigeonhole principle there must be two powers, say &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; and without loss of generality &quot;s&quot; &gt; &quot;t&quot;, such that &quot;a&quot;&quot;s&quot; ≡ &quot;a&quot;&quot;t&quot; (mod &quot;n&quot;). Since &quot;a&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are coprime, &quot;a&quot; has an inverse element &quot;a&quot;−1 and we can multiply both sides of the congruence with &quot;a&quot;−&quot;t&quot;, yielding &quot;a&quot;&quot;s&quot;−&quot;t&quot; ≡ 1 (mod &quot;n&quot;).

The concept of multiplicative order is a special case of the order of group elements. The multiplicative order of a number &quot;a&quot; modulo &quot;n&quot; is the order of &quot;a&quot; in the multiplicative group whose elements are the residues modulo &quot;n&quot; of the numbers coprime to &quot;n&quot;, and whose group operation is multiplication modulo &quot;n&quot;. This is the group of units of the ring Z&quot;n&quot;; it has &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) elements, φ being Euler&#x27;s totient function, and is denoted as &quot;U&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) or &quot;U&quot;(Z&quot;n&quot;).

As a consequence of Lagrange&#x27;s theorem, the order of &quot;a&quot; (mod &quot;n&quot;) always divides &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). If the order of &quot;a&quot; is actually equal to &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), and therefore as large as possible, then &quot;a&quot; is called a primitive root modulo &quot;n&quot;. This means that the group &quot;U&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is cyclic and the residue class of &quot;a&quot; generates it.

The order of &quot;a&quot; (mod &quot;n&quot;) also divides λ(&quot;n&quot;), a value of the Carmichael function, which is an even stronger statement than the divisibility of &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).

<text>In organic chemistry, phthalic acid is an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, with formula and structure . Although phthalic acid is of modest commercial importance, the closely related derivative phthalic anhydride is a commodity chemical produced on a large scale. Phthalic acid is one of three isomers of benzenedicarboxylic acid, the others being isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid.

==Production==
Phthalic acid is produced by the catalytic oxidation of naphthalene or &quot;ortho-&quot;xylene directly to phthalic anhydride and a subsequent hydrolysis of the anhydride.

Phthalic acid was first obtained by French chemist Auguste Laurent in 1836 by oxidizing naphthalene tetrachloride. Believing the resulting substance to be a naphthalene derivative, he named it &quot;naphthalic acid&quot;. After the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac determined its correct formula, Laurent gave it its present name. Manufacturing methods in the nineteenth century included oxidation of naphthalene tetrachloride with nitric acid, or, better, oxidation of the hydrocarbon with fuming sulfuric acid, using mercury or mercury(II) sulfate as a catalyst.

==Synthesis==
Naphthalene, on oxidation with potassium permanganate or potassium dichromate, gives Phthalic anhydride, which, through hydrolysis with hot water, gives Phthalic acid.

==Uses==
Phthalic acid in the form of phthalic anhydride is an important industrial chemical, used for making phthalates (esters of phthalic acid) that are used as plasticizers. However, phthalic anhydride is usually not made by dehydration of phthalic acid but from p-xylene or naphthalene.

==Reactions==

It is a dibasic acid, with p&quot;K&quot;as of 2.89 and 5.51. The monopotassium salt, potassium hydrogen phthalate is a standard acid in analytical chemistry. Typically phthalate esters are prepared from the widely available phthalic anhydride. Reduction of phthalic acid with sodium amalgam in the presence of water gives the 1,3-cyclohexadiene derivative.

==Safety==
The toxicity of phthalic acid is moderate with (mouse) of 550 mg/kg.

==Biodegradation==
The bacteria &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; sp. P1 degrades phthalic acid.

<text>Auguste Laurent (14 November 1807 – 15 April 1853) was a French chemist who helped in the founding of organic chemistry with his discoveries of trichloroethylene, anthracene, phthalic acid, and carbolic acid.

He devised a systematic nomenclature for organic chemistry based on structural grouping of atoms within molecules to determine how the molecules combine in organic reactions. He studied under Jean-Baptiste Dumas as a laboratory assistant. At that time, the weight of carbon was considered to be 6. Laurent thought that a weight of 12 was more logical, and started drawing structures on that basis. He published his work in conjunction with Charles Frédéric Gerhardt. Shunned by Dumas, he eked out a living teaching in the mineral engineering lab - where he taught a young Louis Pasteur how to crystalize tartaric acid. Laurent died in Paris from tuberculosis. Alexander Williamson in England read Laurent&#x27;s writing, leading to the Williamson Ether Synthesis that confirmed the validity of Laurent&#x27;s approach.

<text>Ibrahim Khan Lodi (; 1480 – 21 April 1526) was the last Sultan of the Delhi Sultanate, who became Sultan in 1517 after the death of his father Sikandar Khan. He was the last ruler of the Lodi dynasty, reigning for nine years until 1526, when he was defeated and killed at the Battle of Panipat by Babur&#x27;s invading army, giving way to the emergence of the Mughal Empire in India.

==Biography==
Ibrahim attained the throne upon the death of his father, Sikandar, but was not blessed with the same ruling capability. He faced a number of rebellions. Ibrahim also displeased the nobility when he replaced old and senior commanders with younger ones who were loyal to him. 

In 1526, Ibrahim faced the army of Babur. Ibrahim&#x27;s much larger army was defeated at the Battle of Panipat, and he was killed in the battle. It is estimated that Babur&#x27;s forces numbered around 12,000–25,000 men and had between 20 and 24 pieces of canons. Ibrahim had around 50,000 to 120,000 men along with around 400 to 1000 war elephants. In the battle the Lodi forces suffered over 20,000 killed and many more wounded and captured. After the end of Lodi dynasty, the era of Mughal rule in Delhi commenced for next 331 years.

==Tomb==

His tomb is often mistaken to be the &quot;Shisha Gumbad&quot; within Lodi Gardens, Delhi. Rather Ibrahim Khan Lodi&#x27;s Tomb is actually situated near the tehsil office in Panipat, close to the Dargah of Sufi saint Bu Ali Shah Qalandar. It is a simple rectangular structure on a high platform approached by a flight of steps. In 1866, the British relocated the tomb during construction of the Grand Trunk Road and renovated it with an inscription highlighting Ibrahim Khan Lodi&#x27;s death in the Battle of Panipat. He also built a Khwaja Khizr Tomb in Sonipat in 1522.

==Jalal Khan Lodi&#x27;s Revolt==
In 1520, Ibrahim&#x27;s eldest brother and heir to the throne, Jalal Khan Lodi, marched with an army from Jaunpur towards Delhi to take the throne. Hearing of Jalal Khan&#x27;s revolt, Ibrahim imprisoned his brothers Ismail Khan Lodi, Hussain Khan Lodi, Daulat Khan Lodi and Mahmud Khan Lodi at the fort of Hansi. He marched towards Awadh to meet his brother Jalal&#x27;s army and after defeating the army, he forgave his brother and repositioned him as governor of Jaunpur and Lakhnau (or Lucknow).

<text>Sazan () is an Albanian uninhabited island in the Mediterranean Sea. The largest of Albania&#x27;s islands, it is a designated military exclusion zone; it lies in a strategically important location between the Strait of Otranto and the mouth of the Bay of Vlorë, marking the border between the Adriatic and Ionian seas.

In 2010, of the island&#x27;s surrounding marine area was designated as the Karaburun-Sazan Marine Park. In clear weather, Sazan is sometimes visible from the coast of Salento, Italy, to its west. The island has been open to the public since July 2015. The island has a surface area of . It is long and wide, and its coastline measures about .

== History ==

Sazan was known as &quot;Sason&quot; (Σάσων) to the ancient Greeks, and &quot;Saso&quot; to the ancient Romans. Pseudo-Scylax mentioned it in his &quot;Periplus&quot;. Polybius wrote that there had been a military encounter there in 215 BC between the forces of Philip V of Macedon and the Romans. The island was part of the Roman Empire, and later came under Byzantine rule. 

In 1279, it was captured by the Anjou of Naples, and in the 14th century, it was held by Albanian lords, often under the protection of the Republic of Venice.

Around 1400, the Ottomans captured it, but by 1696 it was controlled by the Venetians. In 1815, it came under the protection of Britain along with the Ionian Islands, which were made an autonomous republic.

In 1864, the island was ceded to Greece along with the rest of the Ionian Islands. But Greece did not occupy it, and it came under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of the Ottomans. It was not until the First Balkan War, in 1912, that Greece landed soldiers on the island and formally claimed it, calling it &quot;Sasona&quot; (Σάσωνα). After the end of the Second Balkan War in 1913, Italy and Austria-Hungary pressed Greece to evacuate all of Northern Epirus, including the island. Due to the risk of starting a war with Italy, Greece evacuated it.

Italy in turn occupied it on 30 October 1914, and established a military commander on the island, which is called Saseno in Italian. This was later ratified on 26 April 1915 by the secret Treaty of London. After World War I, Albania formally ceded the island to Italy on 2 September 1920 as part of the Albano-Italian protocol.

The island was part of Italy from 1920 until after World War II, administratively part of Lagosta, in the province of Zara. In those years the Italian authorities built a lighthouse and some naval fortifications, and populated the island with a few families of fishermen relocated from Apulia. The island was united to the Italian Governatorate of Dalmatia in 1941 during World War II and ceded to Albania on 10 February 1947, under the postwar peace treaty with Italy.

===Post–World War II===
During the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, Albania relied heavily on the Soviet Union. During that time, the Soviets built a base for Whiskey-class submarines and a chemical/biological weapons plant on the island and surrounding areas. After the fall of communism four submarines remained at Pasha Limani port in the bay of Vlore. To this day, many Soviet-era gas masks can still be found scattered around the valley of the island.

The island now is uninhabited but there is a small Italo-Albanian naval base, used mainly to counter contraband between southern Italy and Albania and as a training field for the British Royal Navy. In 2010, the island&#x27;s surrounding sea waters, and those of adjacent Karaburun Peninsula were proclaimed a National Marine Park by the Albanian government.

== Environment ==
=== Geography and climate ===
Sazan is the largest island in the country and Albania&#x27;s westernmost point. It is strategically located at the entrance to the Bay of Vlorë, in the eastern Strait of Otranto separating Italy from Albania. It is also located at the informal junction line of the Adriatic and Ionian Sea inside the Mediterranean Sea, which is just to the south according to international scientific bodies.

The island is composed of limestone rocks, which was formed during the Cretaceous period, while the eastern part is partially composed of terrigenic and cleistogenic deposits. It has four peaks, the highest standing at above sea level followed by two peaks in the center and , and the lowest with in the south of the island. Sazan has a coastline of about characterized by sandy beaches, capes, rocky cliffs and underwater fauna. Along its western shore the cliffs descending up to underwater. Capes of the island include the Bay of Paradise (&quot;Gjiri i Parajsës&quot;), Bay of St. Nicholas (&quot;Gjiri i Shënkollit&quot;), Cape of Shënkoll, Cape of Kallam, Cape of Jug, Cape of Pëllumba, and Cape of Pulbardha.

The island has a climate unusual in Albania, due to its maritime location. It is not mediterranean but rather subtropical on account of its warm winters and hot summers. The climate and vegetation resemble those of the south of Crete in Greece, Tunisia and even parts of Egypt. The flora is different from that of the rest of Albania in that it is subtropical. A small tornado or waterspout was spotted along the coast coming inland in August 2002.

=== Flora and fauna ===

Biogeographically, Sazan Island falls within the Illyrian deciduous forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub. Due to the combination of southern geographic latitude and high altitude and as well the variation of climate, geological and hydrological conditions have contributed to the formation of a unique flora inside the island.

The variety of flora and vegetation can be explained by its strategically position between the western and eastern Mediterranean Sea. The island is home to 435 species (419 indigenous) of vascular plants, or 8.2% of Albania&#x27;s entire vascular flora. There are only one endemic (&quot;Limonium anfractum&quot;) and three subendemic (&quot;Centaurea pawlowski&quot;, &quot;Scutellaria rupestris&quot; and &quot;Verbascum guicciardini&quot;) plants. The varied relief creates various ecological environments for plants, further diversified by the dominant rock types which form siliceous and calcareous terrain on the territory of the park. The rocky shores and limestone sea cliffs on the southern corners of Sazan are home to numerous halophile species such as lotus cytisoides and limonium anfractum. The forests of Sazan are generally composed of shrubs, sclerophyll forests with holm oak, deciduous forests with hophornbeam and south European flowering ash.

<doc id="344553" wikidata="Q233933" url="?curid=344553" title="Tarija Department">
<text>Tarija () is a department in Bolivia. It is located in south-eastern Bolivia bordering with Argentina to the south and Paraguay to the east. According to the 2024 census, it has a population of 534,348 inhabitants. It has an area of . The city of Tarija is the capital of the department.

==Subdivisions==
The department is divided into five provinces and one autonomous region:

# Gran Chaco Province (autonomous region)
# Aniceto Arce Province
# José María Avilés Province
# Cercado Province
# Eustaquio Méndez Province
# Burdett O&#x27;Connor Province

Notable places in Tarija include:
* Villamontes in the department&#x27;s oil-producing eastern scrubland. Villamontes has recorded the hottest temperature ever in Bolivia, , several times, most recently on 29 October 2010.
* Bermejo, a border town adjoining Aguas Blancas, Argentina
* Yacuiba, a border town with Argentina.

The Department of Tarija is renowned for its mild, pleasant climate, and comprises one of the country&#x27;s foremost agricultural regions. Its citizens have traditionally felt close to, and conducted a lively international trade with, neighboring towns of northern Argentina. Between 1816 and 1898, the region was part of Argentina, and was ceded to Bolivia in exchange for Puna de Atacama.

Tarija boasts South America&#x27;s second-largest natural gas reserves. Increased gas revenues and foreign direct investment in gas exploration and distribution are fueling growth and turning Tarija into Bolivia&#x27;s next industrial hub. Political instability at the national level has hindered development of the reserves, as the region has chosen to align with pro-autonomy forces which aim at the devolution of considerable powers away from the central government in favor of the departments.

More than 20 different indigenous tribes, ranging in population from 20 persons up to 1500, live in the region. The Guaraní is the largest tribe. 

Important battles and events related to the 1932-35 Chaco War with Paraguay took place in the department&#x27;s eastern dry lands. Tarija was the home of Víctor Paz Estenssoro, leader of the 1952 Bolivian Revolution and four-time Constitutional President.

==Economy==
The main economic activity is the wine industry. The land and climate are ideal for grape and wine production. The city of Tarija holds an annual Festival of Wine and Cheese.

The petroleum industry is important not only for the region but also for the country as a whole, especially the gas industry which is exported to Argentina and Brazil. The autonomous region of Gran Chaco is from where most of the gas is exploited.

==Demographics==

==Languages==

The languages spoken in the department are mainly Spanish and Guaraní, And spoken by the migrants Quechua and Aymara. The following table shows the numbers belonging to the recognized groups of speakers.

<doc id="344554" wikidata="Q895390" url="?curid=344554" title="Bow Wow Wow">
<text>Bow Wow Wow are an English new wave band, created by manager Malcolm McLaren in 1980. McLaren recruited members of Adam and the Ants to form the band with then 13-year-old Annabella Lwin on lead vocals. They released their debut EP &quot;Your Cassette Pet&quot; in 1980 and had their first UK top 10 hit with &quot;Go Wild in the Country&quot; in 1982. The band&#x27;s music was characterized by a danceable new wave sound that drew on a Burundi beat provided by Dave Barbarossa on drums, as well as the subversive, suggestive, and sometimes exuberant lyrics sung and chanted by their teenage lead vocalist.

==Formation==
In 1980, former Sex Pistols manager McLaren persuaded David Barbarossa (also known as Dave Barbe), guitarist Matthew Ashman and bassist Leigh Gorman to leave Adam Ant and form a new group under McLaren&#x27;s management. The band embarked on a six-month audition process for a lead singer. Talent scout Dave Fishel heard 13-year-old Lwin singing along to the radio at a West Hampstead dry cleaner where she worked, and Fishel persuaded McLaren to audition her. Shortly after Lwin joined the group, McLaren added a second lead singer, George Alan O&#x27;Dowd, dubbed &quot;Lieutenant Lush&quot; (in an early version of &quot;Mile High Club&quot;, Annabella refers to herself as &quot;Captain Lush&quot;). His stay was short-lived, however; O&#x27;Dowd soon formed a new band called Culture Club and went on to stardom under the name &quot;Boy George&quot;.

==EMI Records==
Bow Wow Wow signed with EMI Records in July 1980 and released their first single, &quot;C·30 C·60 C·90 Go!&quot; shortly after that. Initially released only on cassette, it was the world&#x27;s first-ever cassette single (a 7&quot; vinyl version was released several months later). EMI did not promote the &quot;cassingle&quot; due to its lyrics (&quot;Off the radio I get constant flow/Hit it, pause it, record and play/Turn it, rewind and rub it away&quot;), which promoted home taping at a time when music piracy was a hot-button issue. The B-side, &quot;Sun, Sea and Piracy&quot;, also promoted home taping, then lying on a beach and enjoying the fruits of this labour. Both tracks were on side one of the tape, making the second side blank, presumably so the listener could follow Annabella&#x27;s lead. Despite its lack of promotion, &quot;C·30 C·60 C·90 Go!&quot; reached No. 34 on the UK Singles Chart and stayed on the chart for seven weeks.

Bow Wow Wow performed on a Peel Session on 20 October 1980, and in November, they released the cassette-only mini-album &quot;Your Cassette Pet&quot;. It contained only eight tracks and was not available on vinyl; therefore, it was ineligible for the UK Albums Chart. However, it peaked at No. 58 on the UK Singles Chart. One notorious track from the mini-album was &quot;Sexy Eiffel Towers&quot;. It was credited to Ashman, Barbarossa, Gorman, and McLaren and included suggestive moaning and heavy breathing performed by then-14-year-old Lwin. Other controversial tracks included &quot;Louis Quatorze&quot; (which called attention to Lwin&#x27;s young age), &quot;Uomo Sex Al Apache&quot;, and &quot;Radio G-String&quot;. All tracks on &quot;My Cassette Pet&quot; are credited to the four men except &quot;Fools Rush In&quot;. McLaren was already renowned for his creative use of provocation to raise public awareness of his projects (and for occasionally taking things too far).

Both &quot;C·30 C·60 C·90 Go!&quot; and &quot;Your Cassette Pet&quot; ranked among the top 10 &quot;Tracks of the Year&quot; for 1980 by &quot;NME&quot;. When their second single, &quot;W.O.R.K. (N.O. Nah, No No My Daddy Don&#x27;t)&quot; failed to chart, EMI dropped the group.

==RCA Records &amp; &quot;See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang, Yeah! City All Over, Go Ape Crazy&quot;==
In 1981, after splitting from EMI, Bow Wow Wow signed with A&amp;R head Bill Kimber at the U.K. division of RCA Records. Their first full-length album was released in October of that year: &quot;See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang Yeah, City All Over! Go Ape Crazy!&quot; The cover photograph (by Andy Earl) depicted the band recreating Édouard Manet&#x27;s &quot;Le Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; with a then 14-year-old Lwin posing nude, with her side turned toward the camera and arm and leg positioned to hide explicit content. The cover caused outrage, and Lwin was almost made to quit the band due to the controversy. Lwin&#x27;s mother alleged exploitation of a minor for immoral purposes and instigated a Scotland Yard investigation. As a result, the band was forbidden to leave the UK until McLaren promised not to promote Annabella as a &quot;sex kitten&quot;. Regardless, the photo appeared a second time on the cover of the band&#x27;s follow-up EP &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;.

From &quot;See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang, Yeah, City All Over! Go Ape Crazy!&quot;, Bow Wow Wow scored its first UK top 10 hit with &quot;Go Wild in the Country&quot; in early 1982. The single featured a third appearance of the band&#x27;s take on Manet&#x27;s &quot;Le Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; on the sleeve. Around the same time, Bow Wow Wow toured the US, opening for the Pretenders and the Police. The band was set to tour Europe, opening for Queen (who were supporting their dance-oriented &quot;Hot Space&quot; album), but they were poorly received by Queen&#x27;s fans and were dropped from the tour before the dates were completed. In May, they toured Japan, supporting Madness.

==&quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;==
In May 1982, RCA Records released the four-track &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, produced by Kenny Laguna and containing their biggest hit single, &quot;I Want Candy&quot;. The remake of the 1965 hit by the Strangeloves was featured in an early music video on MTV. The single reached No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart in June 1982. The EP also included a remixed version of &quot;Louis Quatorze&quot;, which first appeared on &quot;Your Cassette Pet&quot;. &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; peaked at No. 67 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, their highest entry on the chart.

Laguna also produced Bow Wow Wow&#x27;s follow-up single, &quot;Baby, Oh No&quot;, the first single from Bow Wow Wow to chart in America (No. 103). The lyrics to the song were later reworked for advertising use by the Japanese cosmetic brand Perky Jean by Shiseido.

==&quot;I Want Candy&quot;==
Following the success of the &quot;I Want Candy&quot; music video on MTV, RCA compiled an album, &quot;I Want Candy&quot;, to capitalize on their newfound American audience. Once again, the cover photo (by Jim Varriale) featured a nude Lwin painted entirely in gold. Side one of &quot;I Want Candy&quot; contained all four tracks from &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; and &quot;Baby, Oh No&quot;. Side two consisted of four tracks from &quot;See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang, Yeah. City All Over! Go Ape Crazy!&quot; and &quot;El Boss Dicho&quot;, the B-side to &quot;Go Wild in the Country&quot;. The album peaked at No. 123 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Meanwhile, EMI reissued all their recordings under the same title &quot;I Want Candy&quot;. The EMI album matched &quot;See Jungle&quot;&#x27;s position of number 26 on the UK album charts. It was released in North America as &quot;Twelve Original Recordings&quot; and elsewhere as &quot;Original Recordings.&quot;

==&quot;When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going&quot;==
In 1983, RCA released Bow Wow Wow&#x27;s second full-length album, &quot;When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going&quot;. At the behest of Ashman, Lwin wrote all the lyrics on the album. The cover photography was by David Bailey, and the album credits gave &quot;a kiss&quot; to &quot;Jim&quot; (James Honeyman-Scott) and John Belushi, who had both recently died.

The lead single, &quot;Do You Wanna Hold Me?&quot;, reached No. 47 in the UK (the band&#x27;s last charting single in the UK), but fared best on the Dutch charts, where it peaked at No. 3. With the help of a video in heavy rotation on MTV, the song achieved moderate success in the US, reaching No. 77 on the charts.

The group had planned to embark on a world tour in support of &quot;When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going,&quot; but tensions within the group were rising, as the members were suffering from illness and exhaustion after a successful but intense U.S. tour. In September 1983, Lwin was suddenly and unceremoniously fired from the band. She reportedly learned of her ousting by reading it in &quot;NME&quot;. Shortly after their breakup, they appeared in the 1984 Rob Cohen British-American comedy film &quot;Scandalous&quot;, performing &quot;Where&#x27;s My Snake?&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s the Time (Hey Buddy)&quot;.

==Post-breakup==
The remaining members formed a new group, Chiefs of Relief, with guitarist Ashman as its lead singer. Their sole album was a 1988 self-titled release issued in the US on Sire Records. Ashman later played with other bands, such as Max and Rams. He was a member of Agent Provocateur when he died (in 1995, at age 35) from diabetes complications. They released the album &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; in 1997, posthumously featuring Ashman on guitar, bass guitar, and Vox organ.

Barbarossa/Barbe went on to work with other artists, including Beats International, Republica, Chicane, Adamski and Roland Gift of Fine Young Cannibals. He performed live with Adam Ant in 1995, and both he and Gorman toured with Ant in 2014 - thus reuniting the three surviving members of the Ants lineup that McLaren had broken up in January 1980 - for a series of concerts recreating the album &quot;Dirk Wears White Sox&quot; as part of Ant&#x27;s band &quot;The Ministers of the New New Super Heavy Punk Funk&quot; with a concert at Hammersmith Apollo in April 2014 (later released as live DVD &quot;Dirk Live At The Apollo&quot;). Barbe wrote two novels, &quot;Mud Sharks&quot; and &quot;We Were Looking Up&quot;.

Gorman went into production after the demise of Chiefs of Relief. In 1989, Silver Bullet&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Seconds To Comply&quot;, which Gorman produced, reached No. 11 on the UK Singles Chart. The Soho single &quot;Hippychick&quot; went top 10 and topped the dance charts on both sides of the Atlantic. Gorman earned a gold record for his work on the track. He subsequently joined Soho for a US tour and appeared on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;.

Gorman worked with McLaren again, co-writing and producing the 1994 album &quot;Paris&quot;. The jazz-influenced album sold well throughout Europe, resulting in an album of Gorman&#x27;s ambient dance mixes. The duo collaborated on several high-profile TV commercials and two film scores. Gorman himself wrote and produced music for television spots for clients such as Coca-Cola, MCI, Nike, Inc., Pepsi, and Renault. In the summer of 1997, his remix of Mr. President&#x27;s &quot;I Give You My Heart&quot; spent three weeks in the Top 10 of the UK Dance Chart. He joined the rave band Electric Skychurch in 2006.

Known simply as &quot;Annabella&quot;, Lwin remained with RCA Records, and her first solo release was the 1985 single &quot;Don&#x27;t Dance With Strangers&quot;, produced by the System. She followed up with the album &quot;Fever&quot; in 1986. The title track, a cover of the Peggy Lee classic, was recorded with and produced by multi-instrumentalist Jim Lea of Slade. Another single from the album, &quot;War Boys&quot;, produced by John Robie, spent six weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance/Disco, chart, peaking at No. 28. &quot;Don&#x27;t Dance With Strangers&quot; and &quot;Fever&quot; were included on &quot;The Best of Bow Wow Wow&quot;, released by BMI on 29 October 1996.

She formed a new band, Naked Experience, and collaborated with seasoned musicians and songwriters such as Billy Steinberg and Ellen Shipley. In 1994, Sony Soho Square released two singles, &quot;Car Sex&quot; and &quot;Do What You Do&quot;, billed as &quot;Annabella Lwin&quot;. &quot;Car Sex&quot; made the Top 10 in the UK Dance Chart, while the remixed dance follow-up &quot;Do What You Do&quot; (1995), produced by Steve Lironi, spent one week at No. 61 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1999, Cleopatra Records released &quot;Virgin Voices: A Tribute To Madonna, Volume One&quot;. It contained a cover of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; credited to &quot;Annabella Lwin of Bow Wow Wow&quot;.

==Reformation==
In 1997, Lwin and Gorman reformed Bow Wow Wow, adding guitarist Dave Calhoun and drummer Eshan Khadaroo. They embarked on the &quot;Barking Mad&quot; tour in 1997–1998, which produced a compilation CD, &quot;Wild in the U.S.A.&quot; (Cleopatra Records), that included live material and remixes of previous Bow Wow Wow tracks.

In 1998, they collaborated with DJ Swedish Egil on the track &quot;Eastern Promise&quot;, released as part of Egil&#x27;s &quot;Groove Radio Presents: Alternative Mix CD&quot; by Priority Records. They contributed the song &quot;A Thousand Tears&quot; to the 1999 film &quot;Desperate But Not Serious&quot; (retitled &quot;Reckless + Wild&quot; in the US), starring Christine Taylor and Claudia Schiffer, and appeared in the film.

Bow Wow Wow performed at the KROQ Inland Invasion festival in September 2003, with a lineup including Los Angeles guitarist Phil Gough (of Novacaine) and drummer Adrian Young (of No Doubt). In September 2005, Philadelphia native Devin Beaman was brought in as the new drummer.

Bow Wow Wow songs &quot;Aphrodisiac&quot;, &quot;I Want Candy&quot; and &quot;Fools Rush In&quot; (the latter two remixed by Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine) were included on the soundtrack of the 2006 Sofia Coppola film &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;. The band performed on 2 November 2006 at the Maritime Hotel&#x27;s Hiro Lounge in New York City to promote the film.

In 2006, Bow Wow Wow recorded a cover of the Smiths&#x27; song &quot;I Started Something I Couldn&#x27;t Finish&quot;, which appeared on three 2007 releases: a new three-track &quot;I Want Candy&quot; EP (Cleopatra), compilation album &quot;Stop Me If You Think You&#x27;ve Heard This One Before: A Tribute to the Smiths&quot; (Cleopatra) and the soundtrack to the film &quot;Blood &amp; Chocolate: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; (Lakeshore Records).

On the 15th anniversary of Ashman&#x27;s death, the band, featuring original drummer Barbarossa and guitarist Will Crewdson, performed at a tribute concert for Ashman on 21 November 2010 at the Scala in London. Adam Ant headlined the show and also featured members of Ashman&#x27;s other bands, Chiefs of Relief and Agent Provocateur. Crewdson would later again serve as a replacement for Ashman alongside Gorman and Barbarossa, backing Ant on the above-mentioned 2014 &quot;Dirk Wears White Sox&quot; concerts.

With a new guitarist (Jimmy Magoon) and drummer (Dylan Thomas), Bow Wow Wow played shows in California and toured the UK in 2011–2012.

In December 2012, Gorman began performing under the name &quot;Bow Wow Wow&quot; without original lead singer Lwin, and launched a new Bow Wow Wow Facebook page after Lwin suddenly left the band. This version of the band included new singer Chloe Demetria of the band Vigilant as well as guitarist Matthew Fuller and drummers Lyle Riddle and Sean Winchester. In 2014, actor/musician Zachary Throne (Sin City Sinners) took over on guitar, and Les Warner replaced Winchester. In a 2016 &quot;Washington Times&quot; interview, Gorman indicated that he was interested in creating new Bow Wow Wow music with this lineup.

Lwin has continued to perform billed as &quot;Annabella Lwin of the original Bow Wow Wow&quot;. Her official website states, &quot;Any shows advertised as Bow Wow Wow WITHOUT Annabella, featuring a hired singer from another band, are done without knowledge, permission or consent. Before you buy a ticket, make sure it is the ORIGINAL voice of Bow Wow Wow!&quot;

Gorman assembled a new lineup for Bow Wow Wow as of January 2020, with &quot;Dinzy&quot; Kristen Dinsmore as lead vocalist for the Totally 80&#x27;s U.S. winter tour with The Motels and When in Rome II.

As of October, 2021, Madelyn Feller, professionally known as Dame Madelyn, began performing as the group&#x27;s lead vocalist.

==Bow Wow Wow&#x27;s sound==
The group&#x27;s sound was a mix of Lwin&#x27;s &quot;girlish squeal&quot;, chants, surf instrumentals, pop melodies, funk bass, and Barbarossa&#x27;s Burundi ritual music-influenced tom-tom drum beats. They have since been described as new wave, pop and worldbeat.

The degree to which Bow Wow Wow was influenced by—rather than plagiarised—the music of native African nations and tribes such as the Royal Drummers of Burundi and the Zulus has been a matter of debate. It is thought that when McLaren started to advise Adam and the Ants on the direction they should take after &quot;Dirk Wears White Sox&quot;, he gave the band (the instrumentalists who would eventually become Bow Wow Wow) a variety of recordings of world music from which to draw inspiration. When the Ants dropped out to form Bow Wow Wow, Adam Ant took the recordings from the band&#x27;s early work in this new direction to start his new incarnation of the Ants; thus, both bands made music influenced by the recordings offered by McLaren. Among the recordings was one titled &quot;Burundi Black&quot;. The story of &quot;Burundi Black&quot; and the origin of the &quot;Burundi Beat&quot; and the associated controversy was detailed in an excerpt from a 1981 &quot;New York Times&quot; article by Robert Palmer:

It was also charged that Bow Wow Wow plagiarised melodies from Zulu jive songs and Zulu pop songs and turned the original Zulu lyrics into English mondegreens, as with the origin of the lines &quot;See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang, Yeah! City All over Go Ape Crazy!&quot;, &quot;Golly! Golly! Go Buddy!&quot; and &quot;Hey i-yai-yo&quot;. In answer to this issue, the 1981 &quot;Times&quot; article offered the following statement in Bow Wow Wow&#x27;s defence:

In an RCA radio promo vinyl recording, guitarist Ashman responded:

==Legacy==
The Red Hot Chili Peppers name-checked the band on their 1992 single &quot;Suck My Kiss&quot;, which included the lyric &quot;Swimming in the sound of Bow Wow Wow&quot;, and Peppers guitarist John Frusciante has listed Ashman as an influence.

No Doubt&#x27;s Adrian Young said of the opportunity to play drums for Bow Wow Wow from 2003 to 2005, &quot;It is a dream come true to play with a band I grew up idolising. I feel like a kid back in the sand box&quot;.

Film director Sofia Coppola drew inspiration from Lwin when conceiving the style for her film, &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;. Said Bow Wow Wow&#x27;s tour manager in 2006, &quot;They actually based Marie Antoinette, from a styling point of view, on Annabella Lwin. They drew parallels from the fact that they were both young girls who found fame and fortune at a ridiculously early age.&quot;

On 25 May 2018, Cherry Red Records released the three-disc set &quot;Your Box Set Pet (The Complete Recordings 1980–1984)&quot;.

<text>Chiefs of Relief were a British rock group with a unique electro-punk style, punctuated by the guitar work of vocalist Matthew Ashman, and also featuring drummer Paul Cook. The Chiefs fused rock with hip hop and electronic elements from the era but it was as a live outfit that they excelled.

==Career==
The band was formed shortly after the demise of new wave band Bow Wow Wow in 1983. An early line-up included former Bow Wow Wow members Matthew Ashman (who for a brief time tried to continue Bow Wow Wow as their lead singer after they ousted the original singer Annabella Lwin, formed with remaining band members David Barbarossa and Leigh Gorman, with Paul Cook on drums. It later consisted of Ashman, Cook, keyboard player Duncan Grieg (previously the drummer with Martian Dance), and bassist Lance Burman.

The group&#x27;s only album was 1988&#x27;s self-titled release, which was issued in the US by Sire Records. Ashman died in 1995 and, on the fifteenth anniversary of his death, the band reunited for a tribute concert on 21 November 2010 at the Scala in London, in a show with Adam Ant topping the bill. It also featured later Ashman bands, Bow Wow Wow and Agent Provocateur.

<doc id="344560" wikidata="Q1237120" url="?curid=344560" title="Norman Kirk">
<text>Norman Eric Kirk (6 January 1923 – 31 August 1974) was a New Zealand politician who served as the 29th prime minister of New Zealand and as well as the minister of Foreign 
Affairs from 1972 until his sudden death in 1974. He also served as the seventh leader of the Labour Party from 1965 to 1974.

Born into poverty in Southern Canterbury, Kirk left school at the age of 13 and joined the New Zealand Labour Party in 1943. He was mayor of Kaiapoi from 1953 until 1957, when he was elected to the New Zealand Parliament. He became the leader of his party in 1964. Following a Labour victory in the , Kirk became Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and New Zealand changed into a far more assertive and consequential nation. He stressed the need for regional economic development, and affirmed New Zealand&#x27;s solidarity with Australia in adopting an independent and mutually beneficial foreign policy. Having withdrawn New Zealand troops from Vietnam upon taking office, he was highly critical of US foreign policy. In the same year he strongly opposed French nuclear tests in the Pacific, and threatened to break off diplomatic relations if they continued. He promoted racial equality at home and abroad; his government prevented the South African rugby team from touring New Zealand during 1973. However, his government has been criticised for the launching of the Dawn Raids, the aggressive crackdown on alleged overstayers that near-exclusively targeted Pasifika New Zealanders. Kirk relented to public pressure and discontinued the raids in April 1974.

Kirk had a reputation as the most formidable debater of his time and once famously said that &quot;there are four things that matter to people: they have to have somewhere to live, they have to have food to eat, they have to have clothing to wear, and they have to have something to hope for&quot;, often misquoted as &quot;somewhere to live, someone to love, somewhere to work and something to hope for&quot;. In private, he suffered from effects of obesity and work exhaustion; his health rapidly deteriorated in the winter of 1974, and he died suddenly on 31 August that year. His death shocked the nation and led to an outpouring of grief; he is the most recent New Zealand prime minister to die in office. He was given a combined state funeral and tangi in two locations, with a combination of European and Māori rites.

Owing to his energy, charisma and powerful oratory, as well as his untimely death, Kirk remains one of the most popular New Zealand prime ministers. He was succeeded as head of government by Bill Rowling, who lost the subsequent election.

==Early life and family==

Born in Waimate, a town in South Canterbury, New Zealand, Norman Kirk came from a poor background, and his household could not afford things such as daily newspapers or a radio. His father, also named Norman Kirk, was a carpenter, while his mother Vera Janet (née Jury) had migrated from the Wairarapa. Throughout his life, it was often speculated that Norman Kirk had Māori whakapapa, and was of mixed Kāi Tahu ancestry. This led to allegations that Kirk was passing as Pākehā. It was also claimed that Kirk had Māori relatives, which is true at least through his great-niece Jo Luxton, the current Member of the House of Representatives for Rangitata. While Kirk never denied being Māori, a study of his genealogy found no evidence he was Kāi Tahu and he never publicly identified himself as such.. His parents were staunch Salvationists, who worshipped at the Christchurch City Corps. He played baritone in the corps band.

While very intelligent, Kirk did not perform well academically. He left school shortly before he turned thirteen after his father lost his job. Despite this, however, he enjoyed reading, and often visited libraries. In particular, he enjoyed the study of history and geography.

After leaving school, Kirk worked in a number of jobs, initially as an assistant roof-painter and later as a stationary engine driver, operating boilers in various factories. His health, however, deteriorated, and when the New Zealand Army called him up for military service in 1941 it found him medically unfit. After recovering somewhat, he returned to work, holding a number of different jobs.

In 1943, Norman Kirk married Lucy Ruth Miller, known as Ruth, who was born in Taumarunui. The couple had three sons and two daughters. In 1975 Ruth Kirk was named Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE). In 1974, while her husband was Prime Minister, she became patron of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child. She took part in anti-abortion protest marches in Wellington and Hamilton. She died on 20 March 2000, aged 77.

==Early political career==
Also in 1943, Kirk joined the Labour Party&#x27;s branch in Kaiapoi, where he and his wife had decided to build a house. Kirk bought a section at 12 Carew Street for just NZ£40 (compared to today&#x27;s land valuation of NZ$126,000). Owing to a shortage of funds and building materials following World War II, Kirk built the house himself entirely, right down to the casting of the bricks. The house still stands today, albeit with an extension at the back and a hipped corrugated iron roof to replace the original leak-susceptible flat malthoid roof.

In 1951, Kirk became Chairman of the party&#x27;s Hurunui electorate committee. In 1953, Kirk led Labour to a surprising victory in elections for Kaiapoi&#x27;s local council, and he became the youngest mayor in the country at age 30.

As mayor, Kirk showed great creativity and implemented many changes. He surprised officials by studying issues intensely, often emerging with better knowledge of his options than the people functioning as his advisors. He resigned as mayor on 15 January 1958 and moved his family to Christchurch after being elected MP for the electorate.

==Member of Parliament==


In 1954, Kirk stood as the Labour candidate for the Hurunui seat. While he increased Labour&#x27;s share of the vote considerably, he did not win. Following this, Kirk sought the Labour nomination for a by-election in Riccarton, but ultimately withdrew from the selection contest. He then turned his attention to winning nomination in the seat of Lyttelton, which Labour surprisingly lost to the National Party in a previous election. Kirk beat five better known and connected candidates including Mayor of Lyttelton Frederick Briggs and Lyttelton Borough Councillor Gladys Boyd for the nomination. At the 1957 general election Kirk won the Lyttelton seat and became a Member of Parliament. In 1969 he transferred to the Sydenham seat which he held until his death.

Throughout his political career, Kirk promoted the welfare state, supporting government spending for housing, health, employment, and education. As such, Kirk often appeared as a champion for ordinary New Zealanders. His working-class background also gave him some advantage, as ordinary voters saw many other politicians as out-of-touch and aloof. Gradually, Kirk began to rise through Labour&#x27;s internal hierarchy, becoming vice-president of the party in 1963 and president of the party in 1964. He came to the attention of media and colleagues as a potential future leader. He stood for the position of Deputy Leader in 1963 following the death of Fred Hackett but was defeated by Hugh Watt. Despite lacking Watt&#x27;s length of service or ministerial experience Kirk only lost by one vote, a surprising show of support.

With the memory of the &quot;Black Budget&quot; still plaguing Labour leader Arnold Nordmeyer&#x27;s profile and many within the party believed that it was time for a fresh start, in 1965 a group of mainly younger Labour MPs formed a group who became dedicated to replace Nordmeyer with Kirk, becoming known as the &quot;Mafia&quot;. At the end of 1965 he successfully challenged Arnold Nordmeyer for the parliamentary leadership, becoming Leader of the Opposition. As leader Kirk assembled a more formal shadow cabinet system amongst the Labour caucus than had been seen in the past wishing to boost the profile of his senior MPs. However, he found it challenging to avoid it being composed mainly of Auckland and Christchurch based MPs.

Using the slogan &quot;Make things happen&quot;, Kirk led Labour into the 1969 general election — the party did not win a majority, but it did increase both its share of the vote and number of seats to 44.2% and 39.

==Prime Minister (1972–1974)==

In February 1972 Keith Holyoake resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced by Jack Marshall. Not even this could blunt Labour&#x27;s campaign slogan, &quot;It&#x27;s Time – Time for a change, time for Labour&quot;, and on 25 November 1972 Kirk led Labour to victory with a majority of 23 seats.

Soon after entering office, Kirk acquired a reputation as a reforming figure. The conservative &quot;Dominion&quot; newspaper bestowed its &#x27;Man of the Year&#x27; prize on him for &quot;outstanding personal potential for leadership&quot;. A few weeks later, on 6 February 1973, Kirk was photographed at a Waitangi Day event holding the hand of a small Māori boy; as Kirk was recognised as Pākehā, the iconic picture seemed to symbolise a new era of partnership between New Zealand&#x27;s people.

Kirk set a frenetic pace implementing a great number of new policies. In particular, the Kirk government had a far more active foreign policy than its predecessor, taking great trouble to expand New Zealand&#x27;s links with Asia and Africa. Immediately after his election as Prime Minister, Kirk withdrew all New Zealand troops from Vietnam, ending that nation&#x27;s eight-year involvement in the Vietnam War and causing high levels of public support for Labour. The Kirk government also abolished Compulsory Military Training (conscription) in New Zealand; since then the New Zealand Defence Force has remained an all-volunteer professional force. Kirk also strengthened relations with the Australian Labor Party and its leader Gough Whitlam. Like Kirk, Whitlam had come to power in 1972 as the first Labor Prime Minister in a considerable time; Kirk had been preceded by 12 years of National Party government, while Whitlam had succeeded a Coalition government that had lasted 23 years. Kirk desired for the two nascent leaders to work together, to foster a boldly independent foreign policy separate from the United Kingdom or the United States. Despite their relative success together in their mutually short periods in office, it is known that Kirk and Whitlam, in private, did not get along and even disliked one another. Kirk was a closer friend to Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, whom he regarded as his mentor, and to British Prime Minister Harold Wilson (despite wanting to escape the influence of Britain), than to Whitlam. Kirk also admired Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, thinking him a serious, intelligent and charming figure.

Two subjects in particular caused comment; one: Kirk&#x27;s strong protest against French nuclear-weapons testing in the Pacific Ocean which led to his government, along with Australia, taking France to the International Court of Justice in 1972 and him sending two New Zealand navy frigates, HMNZS Canterbury and Otago, into the test zone area at Mururoa Atoll in a symbolic act of protest in 1973. The other: his refusal to allow a visit by a South African rugby team, a decision he made because the apartheid régime in South Africa would not accept racial integration for that sport. He was also highly critical of US foreign policy, speaking before the United Nations of the US involvement in the coup d&#x27;état in Chile in 1973.

The Kirk government was also notable for a number of national identity building policies. The government began the tradition of New Zealand Day in 1973, and the government introduced legislation in 1974 to declare Queen Elizabeth II as &quot;Queen of New Zealand&quot;. Christchurch hosted the 1974 Commonwealth Games which had a colourful opening ceremony, seen by many commentators as a festival celebrating New Zealand&#x27;s new sense of self-confidence and optimism. Kirk and his wife hosted the royal family and accompanied them on their tour of New Zealand and the Cook Islands.

The government began the Ohu scheme of communal work groupings in rural areas, allowing committed people (particularly Māori) to return to the land for their livelihood. The scheme assisted people in becoming self-sufficient from the land, enhance spiritual and social wellbeing, allow the development of alternative social models and promote organic farming. Kirk got he idea while visiting Israel in 1971 and witnessing Kibbutz communities leading the media to nickname it &quot;Kirk&#x27;s kibbutzim&quot; when it was announced. People in the Ohu groups did not own the land they were cultivating and leased it from the Department of Lands and Survey, nor were they expected to produce surplus agricultural products (beyond the needs of the immediate community) for export. An advisory group was established and the first Ohu, named the Sunburst community, was eventually opened near Whitianga in 1975.

Kirk&#x27;s government was more environmentally conscious than preceding ones. It was elected on a platform that included a strong endorsement of the ideals of Save Manapouri campaign. In February 1973, Kirk honoured his election pledge and instructed the electricity department not to raise the level of Lake Manapouri. He created an independent body, the Guardians of Lake Manapouri, Monowai, and Te Anau (composed of leading members of the protest) to oversee management of the lake levels.

Kirk appointed Bill Rowling as Minister of Finance. The Labour government enjoyed a record budget surplus in its first year and revalued the currency. However, the slowing global economy, an unprecedented rise in oil prices and a rapid rise in government expenditure led to soaring inflation by 1974.

The Kirk government attracted controversy in March 1974 for starting the Dawn Raids, a series of police raids that primarily targeted Pasifika peoples for overstaying. The government stopped the raids and issued an amnesty in April 1974, but they were later restarted by the Muldoon Government.

==Illness and death==

During his time as Prime Minister, Kirk kept up an intense schedule, refusing to reduce his workload by any significant degree and rarely taking time off (the Chatham Islands was his favourite retreat). Kirk ignored advice from several doctors and from Bob Tizard and Warren Freer to &quot;take care of himself&quot; and to reduce his heavy consumption of Coca-Cola and alcohol (beer, plus later whisky or gin), saying he would have a &quot;short but happy life&quot;. On a trip to India he contracted dysentery and exhibited symptoms of undiagnosed diabetes. 

By 1974 he had difficulty breathing, eating and sleeping. In April Kirk had an operation to remove varicose veins from both legs at once despite advice to have two operations. Doctors and colleagues were urging him to take time off; on 15 August he decided to stay off work for two days, and continued to have problems on his return. Despite considerable discomfort, he went to Palmerston North on 18 August to open St Peter&#x27;s College. This was his last public appearance.

On 26 August 1974, Social Credit leader Bruce Beetham advised Kirk to take a couple of months off to recover, and the Prime Minister decided to have six weeks of complete rest. He had been checked over by many doctors, and an examination by Professor Tom O&#x27;Donnell on 27 August confirmed that Kirk had an enlarged heart, gravely weakened by embolisms, which was not pumping regularly enough to get sufficient oxygen into his bloodstream. One lung was two-thirds incapacitated by a blood clot; his stomach was very sore as his liver was swollen with retained fluid.

Kirk checked into the Home of Compassion Hospital, Island Bay, Wellington on 28 August. He rang and reminisced with close colleagues, and his bed was covered with official papers. On Saturday 31 August he told his wife Ruth, who had been told of his serious situation and came to Wellington, &quot;I am dying .. please don&#x27;t tell anyone&quot;. Soon after 9 pm, while watching a police drama on television (&quot;Softly, Softly: Taskforce&quot; with Stratford Johns on NZBC TV), he slowly slid from a sitting position. He died of a pulmonary embolism when a blood clot released from a vein into his heart cut off the blood flow and stopped the heart. O&#x27;Donnell signed Kirk&#x27;s death certificate.

Kirk&#x27;s death shocked the nation. Biographer Michael Bassett states, &quot;There followed an outpouring of grief paralleled only by that which had followed [Prime Minister] M. J. Savage&#x27;s death in 1940&quot;. Kirk was succeeded as prime minister by Bill Rowling. His son, John Kirk, won the resulting Sydenham by-election in November 1974.

While colleagues had been urging him to take some time off, none were aware of the seriousness of his last illness. Bob Harvey, the Labour Party president, said that Kirk was &quot;a robust man&quot; with the &quot;constitution of a horse&quot;. He proposed a Royal Commission to investigate rumours that he had been killed, perhaps with contact poison, by the CIA. This story returned during the 1999 visit of American President Bill Clinton to New Zealand.

===Funeral===
After a lying-in-state in Parliament House from 2 to 4 September, there was a large official funeral in Wellington Cathedral of St Paul, on Wednesday 4 September attended by Prince Charles, Cook Islands Premier Albert Henry, and Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam; then on 5 September another service, also inter-denominational, in the Christchurch Town Hall followed by a simple burial service in his hometown Waimate. He was buried near his mother&#x27;s grave; the burial service was delayed as the RNZAF Hercules could not land at Waimate and the procession hurried by road to meet the daylight requirement for burials. Memorial services were held around New Zealand, and on 26 September in Westminster Abbey, London.

==Popular culture==
The New Zealand pop band Ebony wrote the song &quot;Big Norm&quot;, featuring tongue-in-cheek lyrics praising Kirk. In 1974, it reached No 4 in the charts and Ebony won a New Zealand music RATA award for group of the year. The last telegram Kirk sent before his death was to Ebony congratulating them on their win.

<text>Ferlin Eugene Husky (December 3, 1925 – March 17, 2011) was an American country music singer who was equally adept at honky-tonk, ballads, spoken recitations, rockabilly and pop tunes.

From 1948 to 1953, he recorded under the stage name Terry Preston. He also created and recorded as the comic, outspoken hayseed character, Simon Crum. In the 1950s and &#x27;60s, his hits included &quot;Gone&quot; and &quot;Wings of a Dove&quot;, each reaching number one on the country charts. Between 1953 and 1975, he had 11 top 10 hits, two dozen top 20 hits and a total of 50 songs in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s top 100 country songs. His versatility and matinee-idol looks propelled a seven-decade entertainment career. In 2010, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
Ferlin Husky was born in Gumbo, Missouri, an unincorporated community in northwestern St. Francois County, Missouri. His mother named him Furland, but his name was misspelled on his birth certificate. Husky grew up on a farm near Flat River and attended school in Irondale. An uncle taught him to play the guitar. After dropping out of high school, he moved to St. Louis, where he worked as a truck driver and steel mill worker while performing in honky tonks at night.

During World War II, Husky served in the United States Merchant Marine for five years, entertaining troops on transport ships. His website states that his ship participated in the D-Day invasion of Cherbourg. His Simon Crum character evolved from stories he told during those years about a Missouri neighbor named Simon Crump.

After the war, Husky continued to develop his Simon Crum character while working as a disc jockey in Missouri and then in Bakersfield, California, into the late 1940s. He began using the stage name Terry Preston at the suggestion of Smiley Burnette who claimed Ferlin Husky would never work on a marquee. He signed with Capitol Records in 1953 as a honky-tonk singer under the guidance of Cliffie Stone, who also managed Tennessee Ernie Ford. When at Capitol, he returned to using his given name although for his first few singles his last named was listed as &quot;Huskey&quot;. A few singles failed before &quot;A Dear John Letter&quot; with Jean Shepard became a number one hit that year topping Billboard magazine&#x27;s country charts and reaching number four on its pop charts. They followed it up that year with &quot;Forgive Me John&quot; which reached number four on Billboard&#x27;s Most Played Country and Western Juke Boxes chart and number 24 on its Hot 100 chart turning the unknown singers into star performers in the United States. In 1955, Husky had a solo hit with &quot;I Feel Better All Over (More Than Anywheres Else)&quot; / &quot;Little Tom&quot;. As Simon Crum, he signed a separate contract with Capitol Records and began releasing records, the biggest of which was 1959&#x27;s &quot;Country Music is Here to Stay&quot; reaching number two for three weeks.

In the late 1950s, Husky had a long string of hits, including the number one &quot;Gone&quot; which stayed at the top of the charts for ten weeks in 1957 and was on the charts for a total of 27 weeks. (Husky had previously recorded the song in 1952 as Terry Preston, but the earlier version lacked the newly emerging Nashville sound production of Bradley Studios, which included strings and backup singers). &quot;Gone&quot; was a crossover success, also reaching number four on the pop music chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The song&#x27;s popularity led to a stint as a summer replacement host in 1957 on CBS-TV&#x27;s &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;.

He began acting, appearing on the &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;, and played himself in the 1957 film &quot;Mister Rock and Roll&quot; (his website states he had bit parts in 18 films, including with Zsa Zsa Gabor and Mamie Van Doren). He received sole top billing in a 1971 low budget, back country film with the film&#x27;s opening credits stating, &quot;Ferlin Husky in &quot;Swamp Girl&quot;&quot;.

in 1960, Bob Ferguson&#x27;s &quot;Wings of a Dove&quot; became his biggest hit, topping the country charts for 10 weeks and reaching number 12 on the pop chart. Husky was also known for his ability to imitate other popular country singers, including Tennessee Ernie Ford and Kitty Wells.

Although he did not have more chart-toppers, he charted three dozen hits between 1961 and 1972, with the biggest being &quot;Once&quot; (1967) and &quot;Just for You&quot; (1968). In late 1972, after over 20 years with Capitol, Husky signed with ABC Records, where he scored several top 40 hits into 1975, with the biggest being the top 20 &quot;Rosie Cries a Lot&quot; (1973). Husky briefly retired in 1977 following heart surgery, then resumed touring. He remained a popular concert draw, performing at the Grand Ole Opry and elsewhere. He was married four times and for the last six years of his life lived with his long-time love, Leona Williams (former wife of Merle Haggard).

Husky suffered from cardiopathy for many years and was hospitalized several times beginning in the late 1970s, including for heart surgery in 2005 and for blood clots in his legs in 2007. He was admitted to St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Springfield, Missouri, on April 19, 2009, with congestive heart failure and pneumonia. On July 15, 2009, his spokesman said he was recuperating at home after being released from a Nashville hospital.

On February 23, 2010, the Country Music Association announced his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. He was heralded for his vocal and comic prowess—and &quot;all around showmanship&quot;—that left a legacy as &quot;one of the best entertainers country music has ever produced&quot;.

On January 16, 2011, he was honored at West St. Francois County High School in Leadwood, Missouri, where local singers and the high-school choir sang some of his hits. Husky also donated several items of memorabilia, including his Country Music Hall of Fame award, to the city of Leadwood which are permanently stored at the high school.

On March 8, 2011, Husky was hospitalized again after several days after not feeling well. By the weekend, he had improved and moved out of the coronary care unit. On March 17, he died of congestive heart failure at his daughter&#x27;s home in Westmoreland, Tennessee.

He was buried next to his son, Danny Louis Husky, in Hendersonville Memory Gardens in Hendersonville, Tennessee.

<text>Gilchrist is a census-designated place in Klamath County, Oregon, United States. The community is located on U.S. Route 97 between Bend and Klamath Falls.

==History==
Gilchrist was the last lumber company town in Oregon. The town was founded in 1938 by the family-owned Gilchrist Timber Company, with Frank and Mary Gilchrist as the owners and town founders. The mill moved there from Jasper County, Mississippi, in search of lumber and lower taxes, building a dam on the Little Deschutes River to create the mill pond. In 1939, Gilchrist School was built by the Public Works Administration.

The Gilchrist Mall was built in 1939. It was the first mall opened east of the Cascade Mountains. The mall included grocery store, post office, drugstore, barbershop, beauty parlor, liquor store, bowling alley, and a library. The mall also housed a club for Gilchrist Lumber Company employees. The club had a bar and lounge area, dance floor, pool tables, and a large meeting hall. While some of the businesses have changed over time, as of 2019 the mall buildings remain essentially unchanged.

The company was sold to Crown Pacific Partners in 1991, which subsequently fired all its employees. The 120 homes and other facilities in the town were subsequently sold to residents and others in 1997, with Crown Pacific retaining the sawmill and timberland. Prior to this sale, all houses in the town were painted in Gilchrist brown (with the exception of a small area on the north end of town called Rainbow Circle by its residents). The timberland and the town&#x27;s sawmill, upgraded to handle smaller logs in 2000, were among the last remaining assets of Crown Pacific, which declared bankruptcy in 2003 and was taken over by creditors at the end of 2004, and again bought by Canadian company Interfor Pacific in 2006. As of 2009, the kindergarten through twelfth grade school had an enrollment of 238 students.

==Climate==
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above . According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Gilchrist has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

<doc id="344570" wikidata="Q1150908" url="?curid=344570" title="The Day of the Locust">
<text>The Day of the Locust is a 1939 novel by American author Nathanael West set in Hollywood, California. The novel follows a young artist from the Yale School of Fine Arts named Tod Hackett, who has been hired by a Hollywood studio to do scene design and painting. While he works, he plans an important painting to be called &quot;The Burning of Los Angeles&quot;, a portrayal of the chaotic and fiery holocaust which will destroy the city. While the cast of characters Tod befriends are a conglomerate of Hollywood stereotypes, his greater discovery is a part of society whose &quot;eyes filled with hatred&quot;, and &quot;had come to California to die&quot;. This undercurrent of society captures the despair of Americans who worked and saved their entire lives only to realize, too late, that the American dream was more elusive than they imagine. Their anger boils into rage, and the craze over the latest Hollywood premiere erupts violently into mob rule and absolute chaos.

In the introduction to &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;, Richard Gehman writes that the novel was &quot;more ambitious&quot; than West&#x27;s earlier novel &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot;, and &quot;showed marked progress in West&#x27;s thinking and in his approach toward maturity as a writer.&quot; Gehman calls the novel &quot;episodic in structure, but panoramic in form&quot;.

==Characters==

===Major characters===
* Tod Hackett – an Ivy League-trained artist who comes to California to find inspiration for his painting and experiences a violent re-visioning of the painting in a nearly literal sink-or-swim moment that nearly claims his life during the mob scene outside Mr. Kahn&#x27;s Pleasure Dome. Tod is hired by the movie studio to paint and decorate sets.
* Homer Simpson – a former accountant at a hotel in Iowa who comes to California at the recommendation of his doctor to restore his health. Soft-mannered, sexually repressed, and socially ill-at-ease, Homer&#x27;s almost constant inner turmoil is expressed through his huge hands which have an uncontrollable and detached nature to them. He acts as a sponsor to Faye Greener.
* Faye Greener – an aspiring Hollywood actress who realizes that she has the face and body for Hollywood, but cannot admit that she lacks a significant talent and struggles to compete for even extra parts.

===Secondary characters===
* Abe Kusich – an adult dwarf bookie/hustler and friend of Faye and Harry Greener.
* Claude Estee – a successful but cynical screenwriter. 
* Earle Shoop – a fake California cowboy who makes a scant salary working at a western wear and novelty shop. He camps out in the hills above Los Angeles with Miguel. Earle tries to date Faye.
* Miguel – a Mexican, Earle&#x27;s sidekick. Miguel keeps roosters for cockfighting. Faye sleeps with Miguel.
* Mrs. Jenning – runs a prostitution service and pornographic film parlor.
* Harry Greener – Faye&#x27;s father, a third-rate vaudevillian from the East who is chronically ill. When he cannot get a performing gig he peddles home-made silver polish, but it is more of an opportunity to work his clowning and schtick than to provide a meaningful income. 
* Adore Loomis – a precocious child actor who teases Homer until he snaps. Homer&#x27;s stomping Adore to death coincides with the eruption of mob violence outside the blockbuster film premiere.

West&#x27;s characters are intentionally shallow, stereotyped stock characters, and &quot;derive from all the B-grade genre films of the period&quot; (Simon, 523). They are what Light calls &quot;grotesques&quot;. In the first chapter of the novel, the narrative voice announces: &quot;Yes, despite his appearance, Tod was really a very complicated young man with a whole set of personalities, one inside the other like a nest of Chinese boxes.&quot;

==Plot summary==
Tod Hackett is the novel&#x27;s protagonist. He moves from the East coast to Hollywood, California in search of inspiration for his next painting. The novel is set in the 1930s during the Great Depression. Most of the characters exist at the fringes of the Hollywood film industry, but Hollywood is merely the backdrop for Tod Hackett&#x27;s revelation. Tod is employed by a Hollywood studio &quot;to learn set and costume designing.&quot; During his spare time, Tod sketches scenes he observes on large production sets and studio back lots. The novel details Tod&#x27;s observation of the filming of the Battle of Waterloo. His goal is to find inspiration for the painting he is getting ready to begin, a work titled &quot;The Burning of Los Angeles.&quot;

Tod falls in love with Faye Greener, an aspiring starlet who lives nearby but Faye only loves men who are good looking or wealthy. She is beautiful but lacks the acting talent to progress beyond roles as an extra. Tod is simply a &quot;good-hearted man,&quot; the kind Faye likes. He imagines that loving her would compare to jumping from a skyscraper and screaming to the ground. Tod wants to &quot;throw himself [at her], no matter what the cost.&quot; Throughout the novel, Tod fantasizes about having a sexual encounter with Faye as an act of rape. Every time he imagines raping her, reality interrupts his fantasy before he can complete the act. Scenes are interrupted prior to their climax frequently throughout the novel. A patron jokes that it is &quot;the old teaser routine,&quot; when a pornographic film viewing at Mrs. Jenning&#x27;s parlor ends unexpectedly due to technical difficulties.

Between his work at the studio and his introduction to Faye&#x27;s friends, Tod interacts with numerous Hollywood hangers-on. Characters like Abe Kusich, the dwarf; Claude Estee, the successful screenwriter; and Earle Shoop, the fake California cowboy, all of whom have difficulty changing their personas from the characters they play to who they are. As a result, there is a clear sense of acting and fakery that spills beyond the confines of Hollywood studios and into the streets of Los Angeles.

Shortly after moving into a neighborhood in the valley, Tod befriends Homer Simpson, a simple-minded bookkeeper from Iowa who moved to California for health reasons. Homer Simpson&#x27;s &quot;unruly hands&quot; operate independently from his body, and their movements are often mechanical. &quot;They demanded special attention, had always demanded it.&quot; When Homer attempts to escape California he is distracted not only by the crowd but his inability to leave the street despite Tod&#x27;s help and insistent encouragement. A neighbor&#x27;s son, the child actor Adore Loomis finds Homer and torments him until Homer violently lashes out against the boy. The novel&#x27;s climactic riot ensues and the chaos surrounding the latest Hollywood premiere turns violent outside Mr. Khan&#x27;s Pleasure Dome. Tod vividly revises &quot;The Burning of Los Angeles&quot; in his mind, while being pushed around in the human waves of the riot. The final scene plays out, uninterrupted. The conclusion of the novel can be read as a moment of epiphany and mental clarity for the artist, or a complete &quot;mental breakdown&quot; and Tod&#x27;s &quot;incorporation into the mechanized, modern world of Los Angeles.&quot;

==Themes==
The characters are outcasts, who have come to Hollywood to fulfill a dream or wish:
&quot;The importance of the wish in West&#x27;s work was first noted by W. H. Auden, who declared (in one of the interludes in &quot;The Dyer&#x27;s Hand&quot;) that West&#x27;s novels were essentially &quot;parables about a Kingdom of Hell whose ruler is not so much a Father of Lies as a Father of Wishes&quot;. In this respect, James Light, in his book &quot;Violence, Dreams, and Dostoevsky: The Art of Nathanael West&quot;, suggests that &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; falls in with a motif in West&#x27;s fiction; the exposure of hopeful narratives in modern American culture as frauds.

As some critics point out, West&#x27;s novel was a radical challenge to modernist literature. Some modernists set themselves up in opposition to mass culture; West depicts it and makes it an integral part of the novel. West&#x27;s use of grotesque imagery and situations establishes the novel as a work of Juvenalian satire. His critique of Hollywood and the mentality of &quot;the masses&quot; depicts an America sick with vanity and the harbor of a malignant sense of perversity.

===Biblical allusions===
The original title of the novel was &quot;The Cheated&quot;. The title of West&#x27;s work may be a biblical allusion to the Old Testament. Susan Sanderson writes: 

===Symbols and metaphors===
The novel opens with protagonist Tod Hackett sketching studio back lot scenes from a major Hollywood production. In the scene, a short fat man barks orders through a megaphone to actors playing the role of Napoleon&#x27;s elite cavalry at the Battle of Waterloo. Waterloo marked the beginning of the end for Napoleon. The chaos of this scene foreshadows the beginning of the end for middle-class Americans in the novel, and the violence that ensues.

James F. Light suggests that West&#x27;s use of mob violence in the novel is an expression of anxiety about the rise of fascism in Europe. Light compares anxiety in the novel to personal anxieties Jews, like Nathanael West, experienced as marginalized individuals living in America. The artist Tod Hackett&#x27;s vision of art, a painting titled “The Burning
of Los Angeles,” devolves into a nightmare of terror. It depicts angry citizens
razing Los Angeles and spreading, uncontrollably, across the American
landscape. In the 1930s, theorists, politicians, and military leaders feared
large crowds or mass formations would produce unpredictable and dangerous
results.

==Reception==
Novelists of his era praised Nathanael West&#x27;s writing, but notoriety and critical acclaim for his works lagged behind those for his peers in terms of readers and book sales. &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; only sold about 1480 copies following its first publishing. Critics began to situate &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; within the literary canon in the 1950s, more than a decade after a fatal car crash claimed the author&#x27;s life. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; seventy-third on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel in its list of 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005. Noted critic Harold Bloom included it in his list of canonical works in the book &quot;The Western Canon&quot;. The novel was adapted into the critically acclaimed film &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (1975), directed by John Schlesinger.

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; was released by Paramount Pictures in 1975. The film was directed by John Schlesinger and starred William Atherton as Tod Hackett, Donald Sutherland as Homer Simpson, Burgess Meredith as Harry Greener, and Karen Black as Faye Greener.

==In popular culture==
* Bob Dylan recorded a song called &quot;Day of the Locusts&quot; for his 1970 album &quot;New Morning&quot;. The song has no relation to the story in West&#x27;s novel. 
* The 1970s &quot;Pop Chronicles&quot; audio documentary includes an excerpt dramatically read by Thom Beck in Show 44, &quot;Revolt of the Fat Angel: Some samples of the Los Angeles sound.&quot;
* The 1982 song &quot;Call of the West&quot; by the Los Angeles new wave band Wall of Voodoo—which &quot;follows some Middle American sad sack as he chases a vague and hopeless dream in California&quot;—has been described as being &quot;as close as pop music has gotten to capturing the bitter chaos of the final chapter of Nathanael West&#x27;s &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;&quot;.
* Matt Groening creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (1989) wrote a novel while he was in high school. One of the character&#x27;s names in the novel is Homer Simpson. &quot;I took that name from a minor character in the novel &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;... Since Homer was my father&#x27;s name, and I thought Simpson was a funny name in that it had the word “simp” in it, which is short for “simpleton”—I just went with it.&quot;
* The novel is mentioned in the comic book series &quot;&quot; (2002–2008), whose main character describes it as &quot;the greatest novel of all time&quot;.
* The novel is referenced in the third season of the television series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; (2003) when a character is being shown a rental house in part of a small community, and comments that it is “very Day of the Locust”.
* The 2009 song &quot;Peeled Apples&quot; from the &quot;Journal for Plague Lovers&quot; album by the Welsh band Manic Street Preachers includes the line referencing one of the novel&#x27;s characters: &quot;a dwarf takes his cockerel out on a cockfight.&quot;
* British theatre company Punchdrunk&#x27;s 2013 performance piece &quot;The Drowned Man &quot;borrows heavily from &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;, incorporating several of the novel&#x27;s characters and themes into the overarching narrative.
* In February 2015, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a 45-minute program dedicated to &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;, heralding it as a major twentieth century classic. The show&#x27;s host, historian Adam Smith, related the roots of the novel to the political situation of the time. He contrasted the message of the novel to the lives of Ronald Reagan, who would go on to become Governor of California, and Richard Nixon, who was &quot;already shaping his skills at &#x27;doing the people&#x27;s hating for them&#x27;&quot;.
* The Aimee Mann song &quot;Patient Zero,&quot; from her 2017 album &quot;Mental Illness&quot;, tells a story of broken dreams in Hollywood, and references the novel with the line &quot;the locusts had their day.&quot;
* Mentioned in a dialogue with Lawrence Krauss titled: &quot;Johnny Depp &amp; Lawrence Krauss: Finding The Creativity In Madness&quot;. Johnny Depp remembers how Hunter Thompson was very impressed with Depp&#x27;s familiarity with &quot;Day of the Locust&quot; as well as Nathanael West more broadly. He felt their shared appreciation for this work brought them closer.

<doc id="344572" wikidata="Q4342321" url="?curid=344572" title="Pacaha">
<text>Pacaha was a Native American polity encountered in 1541 by the Hernando de Soto expedition. This group inhabited fortified villages in what is today the northeastern portion of the U.S. state of Arkansas.

The tribe takes its name from the chieftain Pacaha (born in the early 16th century), who ruled the tribe from its primary village on the Mississippi River, which was thought to be located in present-day Crittenden County, Arkansas near Turrell. The site, part of the Nodena phase, is known to archaeologists as &quot;The Bradley Site&quot;. Information about Chief Pacaha and his people comes from journals made during the expedition of Hernando De Soto in 1541. The de Soto expedition stayed at Pacaha&#x27;s village for approximately 40 days.

==De Soto expedition==

The initial encounter between the Pacaha and the de Soto expedition was violent. Chief Pacaha&#x27;s tribe had been at war for some time with a neighboring chieftain named Casqui. The Casqui tribe is thought to have lived at a site near Parkin, Arkansas, which is the location of the present-day Parkin Archeological State Park.

De Soto had encountered the Casqui tribe first. When he pressed on to visit the Pacaha village, many of the Casqui people followed him. Many of the Pacaha, seeing the approach of their enemy, attempted to flee to an island in the river and drowned. The Casqui who accompanied de Soto sacked the village, desecrated holy sites, and looted valuables.

The Pacaha controlled more territory and had a larger population than the Casqui. Chief Pacaha was younger than the Casqui chief, however, and seemingly had more to lose from the continued aggressive Casqui attacks. De Soto contacted Chief Pacaha and convinced him that he had nothing to do with the attack and that the expedition&#x27;s intentions were peaceful. De Soto assured the Pacaha that the expedition would help the Pacaha attack the Casqui to punish them for their subterfuge.

The Casqui received advance warning of the planned attack. They returned the looted items and apologized in order to stave off retribution. De Soto arranged a dinner for the two leaders and a peace treaty between the tribes. Chief Pacaha presented de Soto with one of his wives, one of his sisters, and another woman from his tribe. This action was in gratitude for the arrangement of peace and also to outdo his rival, who had only presented a daughter to de Soto.

The Hernando de Soto expedition records are the only historical records of Chief Pacaha and his tribe. Their later history is uncertain.

The name Pacaha was spelled Capaha in one account. Some scholars believe this word is related to the historic Quapaw tribe encountered in Arkansas by European expeditions in the 17th and 18th centuries. The primary village of the eastern Arkansas Quapaw was named &quot;Kappa&quot; or &quot;Kappah&quot;. Human and cultural remains found at the suspected Pacaha site are repatriated to the Quapaw and Tunica-Biloxi tribes, which are active.

<doc id="344574" wikidata="Q738848" url="?curid=344574" title="Cabbagetown, Toronto">
<text>Cabbagetown is a neighbourhood in central Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Administratively, it is defined as part of the Cabbagetown-South St. Jamestown neighbourhood. It largely features semi-detached Victorian houses and is recognized as &quot;the largest continuous area of preserved Victorian housing in all of North America&quot;, according to the Cabbagetown Preservation Association.

Cabbagetown&#x27;s name derives from the Irish immigrants who moved to the neighbourhood beginning in the late 1840s, said to have been so poor that they grew cabbage in their front yards. Canadian writer Hugh Garner&#x27;s novel, &quot;Cabbagetown&quot;, depicted life in the neighbourhood during the Great Depression.

==History==
The area today known as Cabbagetown was first known as the village of Don Vale, just outside Toronto. Before the 1850s it consisted of farmland dotted with cottages and vegetable plots. It grew up in the 1840s around the Winchester Street Bridge, which before the construction of the Prince Edward Viaduct was the main northern bridge over the Don River. This was near the site where Castle Frank Brook flowed in the Don River. By the bridge the Don Vale Tavern and Fox&#x27;s Inn were established to cater to travellers. In 1850 the Toronto Necropolis was established in the area as the city&#x27;s main cemetery.
In the late 19th century the area was absorbed into the city. It became home to the working class Irish inhabitants who were employed in the industries along the lake shore to the south in Corktown. Brick Victorian-style houses were built throughout the area. The name Cabbagetown purportedly came from stories of new Macedonian and Irish immigrants digging up their front lawns and planting cabbage. In this era the Cabbagetown name most often applied to the area south of Gerrard Street, with the part to the north still being called Don Vale. It was a working-class neighbourhood, with approximately 50% of the residents renting houses. It reached its peak of prosperity just before the First World War, which is from when many of the brick homes in the area date. The various architectural styles visible in the neighborhood range from Second-Empire to Bay-n-Gable and High Victorian Terraces, with excellent examples being Francis Shields&#x27; House at 377 Sackville St.

After the war the area became increasingly impoverished. A large number of poorer residents moved in, many resorting to share one house among multiple families. The nineteenth-century brick houses began deteriorating and, as landlords saw less value in the neighbourhood, they were not maintained. It became known as one of Toronto&#x27;s largest slums and much of the original Cabbagetown was razed in the late 1940s to make room for the Regent Park housing project. A new immigrant influx also led to the beginning of ethnic diversity in the neighbourhood. The remaining section to the north, then still known as Don Vale, was also slated to be cleared and replaced by housing projects. In 1964 a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; writer wrote that &quot;Cabbagetown has become a downhill ride and if you&#x27;re on way up, you don&#x27;t dare stay there for long unless you live in Regent Park.&quot;

The construction of new housing projects was halted in the 1970s. In Don Mount this effort was led by Karl Jaffary, who was elected to city council in the 1969 municipal election along with a group of like-minded councillors who opposed sweeping urban renewal plans. John Sewell led the effort to preserve Trefann Court, which covered the southern section of the original Cabbagetown. A bylaw was approved in the 1970s to ban any building higher than four storeys, in reaction to the high density high-rises being built in neighbouring St. James Town.

==Gentrification==
Cabbagetown was gentrified by affluent professionals, beginning in the 1970s. Many residents restored small Victorian row houses and became community activists. Darrell Kent, a resident and local businessman, is recognized by the community as having been the driving force behind the restoration of many of the area’s beautiful and unique Victorian houses. As Kent was a gay real estate agent, gay men and some lesbians made up the earliest gentrifying groups of Cabbagetown. They are still a significant part of the population today, and the area is considered queer friendly.

In 1983 the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; wrote, Cabbagetown is probably the epitome of successful labelling. The core of the area—generally defined as being bounded by Parliament, Wellesley and Dundas Streets and the Don Valley—was once Toronto&#x27;s skid row. Today, about a decade after the area was invaded by young professionals, speculators and real estate agents, there are still a few derelicts around to give the area colour. The houses, meanwhile, sell for upward of $200,000.35 years after that article was written, most homes in the area sell for well over $1 million.
Vestiges of a 1960s, counter-culture ambiance remain at vintage clothing stores, health food stores and a gestalt therapy clinic. A Victorian farm, once the site of a zoo, is located adjacent to Riverdale Park West, where a weekly farmer&#x27;s market is held. A short distance away is the Cabbagetown Youth Centre, home of the Cabbagetown Boxing Club, a reminder of an earlier, and rougher, past. In recent years, some businesses from the nearby &quot;gay village&quot; of Church and Wellesley, have relocated to the area, attracted by cheaper commercial rents.

Despite gentrification, residents from public housing projects and affluent home owners mingle at a discount supermarket and a community medical clinic. Panhandling and drug-dealing are part of the urban landscape; so are gourmet shops, upscale boutiques and arts festivals, book launches and wine-tastings at local restaurants. Paradoxically, The Gerrard and Parliament neighbourhood, located near Dundas and Sherbourne Streets, has the largest concentration of homeless shelters and drop-in centres in Canada. The area is also distinguished by a large number of rooming houses and other forms of low-income housing.

<text>Koreatown () is an ethnic enclave within Seaton Village, a neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Located along Bloor Street between Christie and Bathurst Streets, the area is known for its Korean business and restaurants. The ethnic enclave developed during the 1970s, as the city experienced an influx of Korean immigrants settling in Toronto. Toronto has the largest single concentration of Koreans in Canada with 53,940 living in the city, according to the Canada 2016 Census.

In addition to the Koreatown in Seaton Village, the city also holds another cluster of Korean businesses and restaurants in the neighbourhood of Willowdale, informally referred to as Koreantown North, new Koreatown, and uptown Koreatown. The cluster of Korean businesses in Willowdale is centred along Yonge Street, between Finch and Sheppard Avenue.

==History==

The section of Bloor Street west of Bathurst Street was heavily populated by people from Central and South America prior to the influx of Korean immigrants in the late-1960s and 1970s. Prior to this influx, the Korean population in Toronto was approximately 100 in 1966. However, by the 1970s, the Korean population in the city grew to roughly 10,000, with most settling Bloor Street.

The adoption of a more liberal immigration policy by the Canadian government in 1967 led to an influx of Korean immigrants, many of whom settled in the Toronto area. Many of them settled in the Bloor and Bathurst area, with a small Korean business neighbourhood developed along Bloor Street, centred on the intersection of Bloor and Manning Avenue. Restaurants, bakeries, gift shops, grocery stores, and travel agencies began to open up, most of which catered to the Korean-Canadian community. Today, although many Koreans work in the region, very few Koreans in fact live in Koreatown.

==Other Korean communities in Toronto==

A Korean community in the neighbourhood of Willowdale has also developed in recent decades, and has also been referred to as &quot;Koreantown North&quot;, &quot;new Koreatown&quot;, and &quot;uptown Koreatown&quot;. Of the 118,000 residents of Willowdale, more than 10,000 identified Korean as their first language in the Canada 2016 Census. Korean businesses and restaurants are centred around Yonge Street, stretching from Finch Avenue to Sheppard Avenue to the south. Koreans account for more than 13 per cent of the population in the strip of Yonge Street from Finch to Sheppard Avenue.

<doc id="344586" wikidata="Q7308092" url="?curid=344586" title="Regent Park">
<text>Regent Park is a neighbourhood located in downtown Toronto, Ontario built in the late 1940s as a public housing project managed by Toronto Community Housing. It sits on what used to be a significant part of the Cabbagetown neighbourhood and is bounded by Gerrard Street East to the north, River Street to the east, Shuter Street to the south and Parliament Street to the west. Regent Park&#x27;s residential dwellings, prior to the ongoing redevelopment, were entirely social housing and covered all of the 69 acres (280,000 m2) which comprise the community. The original neighbourhood was razed in the process of creating Regent Park. The nickname Cabbagetown is now applied to the remaining historical, area north and west of the housing project, which has experienced considerable gentrification since the 1960s and 1970s.

==History==
Regent Park—and adjoining areas of the Old City&#x27;s east end—were home to some of Toronto&#x27;s historic slum districts in the early 1900s. Most residents of the area were poor and working-class people of British and Irish descent, along with smaller numbers of continental European Jewish and Macedonian immigrants. Concern over crime and social problems in the area, as well as substandard housing, led to plans for affordable housing during the Second World War. These plans came to fruition soon after the end of the war, when the Regent Park North public housing project was approved in 1947. Families began to move into Regent Park North in 1949, but construction continued into the 1950s. The last families moved into Regent Park North in 1957. In subsequent years, more public housing units were built in Toronto, including Regent Park South, which was completed in 1960. The high-rise portion was designed by Page and Steele while the spartan row house and walk-up apartments were designed by John Edward Hoare.
Although Regent Park had been designed to alleviate the area&#x27;s substandard housing, crime, and social problems, these issues soon reemerged. By the mid-1960s, for example, there were complaints about the housing projects falling into a state of disrepair. Changes to the Canadian immigration system in the 1960s led to an influx of multicultural and multiethnic immigrants into the country. Some of these people, including immigrants from the Caribbean, China and Southeast Asia, settled in Regent Park in the 1960s and 1970s, changing the ethnic and racial composition of the neighbourhood. Meanwhile, the area continued to have a reputation of crime. In the early 2000s, a new redevelopment plan for Regent Park was implemented. The plan in question called for Regent Park to be redeveloped as a mixed-income neighbourhood. Because of the area&#x27;s proximity to the downtown core, it is potentially high value real estate. The neighbourhood&#x27;s ethnic composition has changed between 2001 and 2016. In 2001, the neighbourhood was 22% Black, 21.8% South Asian, 19.5% European, 14.1% Chinese, 10.6% Southeast Asian and 3.4% Latin American. By the 2016 census, Europeans had become the largest group, while the presence of visible minority groups declined. The neighbourhood in 2016 was 28% European, 25.7% South Asian, 13.6% Black, 12.5% Chinese and 3.7% Southeast Asian. In Regent Park, the median household income in 2016 was $42,369, although there was a decrease in this income range as compared to 2011. This is lower than the median household income for Toronto at $65,829. As well, the Regent Park neighbourhood has a higher percentage of households without income (5.9%) compared to the City of Toronto average (4.7%) and 44.4% of households are at or below the poverty level, compared to 20.2% for the city average.

===Redevelopment===
More than a half-century old, the Regent Park projects were aging rapidly and in need of costly repairs. The city government developed a plan to demolish and rebuild Regent Park over the next many years, with the first phase having started in the fall of 2005. The addition of market units on site will double the number of units in Regent Park. Former street patterns will be restored and housing will be designed to reflect that of adjacent neighbourhoods (including Cabbagetown and Corktown) in order to end Regent Park&#x27;s physical isolation from the rest of the city. In support of the Clean and Beautiful City campaign by former Toronto Mayor David Miller and to further the goal of renewing architecture in all Toronto Community Housing projects, an architectural competition was held for the design of the first apartment building in the complex. Toronto-based architectsAlliance was selected winner of the competition, with a modern glass point tower set on top of a red-brick podium structure in their proposal. While phase two had not yet been completed, the third stage of the revitalization plan began in May 2014, which will include newer or updated facilities. The revitalization plan has five phases. Phase two of the revitalization plan was completed in 2018 with the third phase set to be completed by 2023/2024.

===Evolution from a transitional community to a residential community===

Regent Park was designed as a transitional community. It was to house people experiencing financial difficulties, or socioeconomic adjustment support. Most residents were on social assistance and working residents paid rent proportional to their income (average total income of individuals in 2010 was $38,714). In the last two decades Regent Park has also become an immigrant community, as immigrants facing difficulties settling in Canada end up living there. Thus, the community is always viewed and administered as a transitional community. This contributed to the concentration of a socially marginalized population and various social ills of Regent Park. In particular, a transitional community failed to generate the awareness, interest and commitment of its residents to invest in the development and sustainability of a higher quality of life.

==Culture==

Various community groups, including the Salvation Army, have been highly active in promoting a positive sense of community and community representation, and in pursuing a higher quality of life. The CRC, which has operated since 1965, offers healthy meals, free clothing, showers and laundry facilities, housing supports, drop-in, life skills and food skills programs. Additionally, they provide the only not-for-profit social housing in Regent Park. Every year, they host Taste of Regent Park in the Big Park, with a pay-what-you-can community catered meal, local vendors and live entertainment. Another such organization is Regent Park Focus Youth Media Arts Centre, which &quot;uses media technology as a tool to employ young people, enhance resiliency, bridge information gaps, increase civic engagement, promote health and effect positive change.&quot; Community Development is a program of the Regent Park Community Health Centre that promotes &quot;individual health and the health of the community by addressing the two principal social determinants of health: education and income.&quot; Moreover, there are various cultural associations such as Regent Park Tamil Cultural Association, which aim to promote intra and inter cultural development and exchange and to foster a healthier community.

===Neighbourhood characteristics===
The majority of the buildings in Regent Park are owned and operated by Toronto Community Housing, the public low-income housing administrator in Toronto. Regent Park is the &quot;Community Housing Unit 27&quot; managed by TCHC and its manager is Ade Davies.

Most units are low rise apartment units bounded by Gerrard Street, Parliament Street, Dundas Street and River Street. The units are three-storey brick buildings with central balconies. On the south side of Dundas Street the housing consists of five high-rise apartment towers with two-storey townhomes on the east and west sides.

==Demographics==
Regent Park has long been recognized as one of the lower-income neighbourhoods in the downtown Toronto area. There is a higher representation of visible minorities, refugees, immigrants and Indigenous people in the neighbourhood compared to neighboring areas. It experiences a higher rate of violence, crime, drug abuse and social ills compared to many other Toronto communities. Regent Park has a reputation for poverty in Toronto. In 2016, median income in part of Regent Park was $42,369, an increase from $22,268 in 2011. The neighbourhood&#x27;s Census Tract (5350030.00) has experienced a significant shift in income structure between the 2006 Census, and 2011 National Household Survey. In the 2006 Census, 61.1% of residents earned less than $20,000 annually. However, by 2011, such low-income residents only constituted 40.4% of residents. By 2016, that number dropped further to 35.2% of residents. The number of those earning more than $60,000 has tripled from in those years, representing 25.6% of the population in 2011. Although a significant portion of residents making less than $20,000, since revitalization, the neighbourhood has become home to a growing number of high-earning residents. This can be explained by a number of potential causes. Either the historical residents have experienced increasing incomes, low-income residents can no longer afford housing in the neighbourhood and are experiencing displacement, or (most likely) owing to the nearly doubling in total residential units in the neighbourhood, the proportion of low-income residents has decreased as a function of the overall increase in residents. The neighbourhood in 2016 was 28% European, 25.7% South Asian, 13.6% Black, 12.5% Chinese and 3.7% Southeast Asian. The poverty rate has dropped to 44.4% in 2016 from a high of 73% in 1996.

==Government==
Canada consists of 338 electoral districts and Regent Park is located in the Toronto Centre riding. For city administration, each district is divided into two city wards. Regent Park is located in Ward 28.

In 2002, Toronto City Councillors recognized the need for increased tenant participation in the day-to-day management of housing. As a result, Toronto Community Housing Corporation (TCHC) initiated the Tenant Participation System (TPS). The first election for TPS was held in 2003. The tenant representatives were volunteers representing a constant number of adjacent units. Overall the formal mechanism set up to give tenants voice in the day-to-day management of the Regent Park had a positive impact. For instance, lighting in Regent Park has improved as a direct result of the TPS representatives requests. However, the mechanism developed for the whole of Toronto&#x27;s various housing communities need to adopt to local conditions in order to meet the needs of the Regent Park residents more effectively.

===Emergency services===
The Toronto Fire Services station 325 is Regent Park&#x27;s fire station, located at 475 Dundas Street East. The Toronto Police Service – 51 Division is responsible for the community. It was located in the community at 30 Regent Street, but has since been moved to nearby 51 Parliament Street. As late as 2001, the relation between some residents and police was confrontational. Paramedics serving the Regent Park area are deployed from Toronto Emergency Medical Services Station 40, an Advanced Life Support and Basic Life Support station staffed with Level II (Advanced Care Paramedic) and Level I (Primary Care Paramedic) crews located at 58 Richmond Street East.

==Education==
Regent Park is served by two public libraries. The Toronto Public Library Parliament branch is located at the corner of Gerrard and Parliament streets and houses a special local history archive about Regent Park. The other nearby library is the Riverdale branch located at the junction of Gerrard Street and Broadview Avenue. In addition, the Children&#x27;s Book Bank is a small nonprofit that provides free books and literacy support, located at 350 Berkeley Street (at Gerrard). The Regent Park Child Care Centre may be found at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, which cares for infants and toddlers.

===Public education===
There are four Toronto-based school boards that provides public education for the city, including the neighbourhood of Regent Park. Two of the four Toronto-based school boards teach primarily in English, the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB). The institutions operated by the other two Toronto-based school boards, the secular Conseil scolaire Viamonde, and separate Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir, teach primarily in French. However, neither French-language school board operates a school in Regent Park. The following TDSB elementary schools operated in Regent Park:
* Nelson Mandela Park Public School on Shuter Street - first opened 1853 as Park Public School (current building built 1914-1917) and renamed in 2001 when Park Public School and Park Senior Public School merged after the late South African President Nelson Mandela; school serves Junior Kindergarten to Grade 8.
* Lord Dufferin Public School on Parliament Street
* Regent Park/Duke of York Junior Public School on Regent Street - opened 1958 as Regent Park PS and merged with Duke of York PS (located at 14 Pembroke Street and now ecole publique Gabrielle Roy of the Conseil scolaire Viamonde) during the period of 1977-1980. This school was demolished in 2015 and a new Toronto District Catholic School will be built at a future date.

==Transportation==

Regent Park is served by several Toronto Transit Commission streetcar routes: 501, 505, 506; and by the 65 Parliament bus route. The streetcars provide quick access to the Yonge subway line, while the 65 Parliament bus provides access to the Bloor-Danforth line. The Don Valley Parkway is a major highway that runs to the east of the neighbourhood.

==Academic study==
Regent Park has attracted the attention of various social science scholars and media. Scholar and activist Dr. Sean Purdy has written his thesis based on his research about Regent Park. His paper &quot;&quot;Ripped Off&quot; By the System: Housing Policy, Poverty and Territorial Stigmatization in Regent Park Housing Project, 1951–1991&quot; provides valuable insights about Regent Park. The recent Regent Park Revitalization Plan is also viewed and undertaken as a pilot Canadian social re-engineering effort. The federal and local governments view the plan as means to establish best practices and bench marks. Although such enthusiasm adds to the momentum of the revitalization plan, the Regent Park history warrants caution as not to repeat or reproduce the shortcomings of its past.

<doc id="344587" wikidata="Q3066528" url="?curid=344587" title="Rosedale, Toronto">
<text>Rosedale is a neighbourhood in central Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was formerly the estate of William Botsford Jarvis, and so named by his wife, granddaughter of William Dummer Powell, for the wild roses that grew there in abundance. It is located north of Downtown Toronto and is one of its oldest suburbs. In 2013, Rosedale was ranked the best neighbourhood in Toronto to live in by &quot;Toronto Life&quot;. According to Today’s Senior Magazine, it is known as the area where the city&#x27;s &#x27;old money&#x27; lives, and is home to some of Canada&#x27;s richest and most famous citizens including Gerry Schwartz, founder of Onex Corporation, Adrienne Clarkson, the 26th Governor General of Canada, and her husband, the author John Ralston Saul, as well as David Thomson, 3rd Baron Thomson of Fleet of the Thomson Corporation, the latter of whom is the richest man in Canada.

Rosedale&#x27;s boundaries consist of the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks to the north, Yonge Street to the west, Aylmer Avenue and Rosedale Valley Road to the south, and Bayview Avenue to the east. The neighbourhood is within the City of Toronto&#x27;s Rosedale-Moore Park neighbourhood. The neighbourhood is divided into a north and south portion by the Park Drive Ravine.

==History==
South Rosedale was first settled by Sheriff William Jarvis and his wife, Mary, in 1826 after Jarvis inherited his father&#x27;s home there two years earlier. Mary Jarvis, the granddaughter of chief justice and loyalist William Drummer Powell frequently walked and rode on horseback around the trails for that formed Rosedale&#x27;s meandering streets (which are one of the area&#x27;s trademarks). She named the estate &quot;Rosedale&quot; as a tribute to the abundance of wild roses that graced the hillsides of their estate. The Jarvis estate was subdivided in 1854 and became Toronto&#x27;s first &quot;garden suburb&quot;. The Jarvis Family sold the Rosedale homestead in 1864, which led to the residential development of the area soon after, including the extension of Cluny Drive.

A noteworthy piece of Rosedale&#x27;s History, is that it was home to Ontario&#x27;s fourth Government House. The house was called Chorley Park, and it was built for the Lieutenant Governor in 1915. It was demolished in 1960 by the city of Toronto to save money. It is now a public park of the same name.

===Notable residents===
One of Canada&#x27;s foremost fiction writers both pre- and post-World War II, Morley Callaghan lived in the southern part of Rosedale at 20 Dale Avenue from 1951 until his death in 1990; a historic plaque at the nearby Glen Road footbridge summarizes Callaghan&#x27;s noteworthy writing career and his best-known literary contemporaries, including Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Hockey Hall of Fame inductees W. A. Hewitt and Foster Hewitt, lived on Roxborough Street at Yonge Street.

==Character==

Rosedale is built among three ravines, preserved as parkland. Rosedale is full of cul de sacs and convoluted routes through the neighbourhood, which coupled with other physical boundaries (such as the ravines and bridges) lead to low levels of vehicular traffic. Even though Rosedale is located in the middle of Toronto, virtually no vehicular traffic can be heard with the abundance of trees and foliage that surround the community. The homes are mostly single family detached dwellings, many of which are at least 100 years old including some former farmhouses that are closer to 200. Houses range from Edwardian and Tudor in style to the more common Victorian and Georgian.

Rosedale Park is home to the annual spring park party, Mayfair. The event typically consists of rides, games, flea market and other such carnival-like activities. The event is traditionally on the first Saturday in May and is run and funded by Mooredale House.

According to Census tracts 0086.00 and 0087.00 of the 2006 Canadian census, Rosedale has 7,672 residents, up 4.8% from the 2001 census. The median income in this Census Tract in the 2006 Canadian Census was $55,906, while the average total income in this Census was $165,827, one of the highest incomes of all Toronto neighbourhoods. The median income level was also double that of Canada and Ontario, while the average total income levels were 4.5 to 5 times larger than that of Ontario and Canada. Similarly, the total income levels reflected in the 2011 National Household Survey (NHS) were exceedingly high with the total income median at $61,284, more than double that of Ontario and Canada, and the total income average at $210,484, more than 5 times that of Ontario and Canada. In 2015 the average Rosedale house sold for over $1,800,000. Additionally, Rosedale possesses a large population of people of English, Scottish, and Irish ethnic origin.

<text>The Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), usually known simply as the blackcap, is a common and widespread typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, and differences across the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, black in the male and reddish-brown in the female. The male&#x27;s typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the Alps. The blackcap&#x27;s closest relative is the garden warbler, which looks quite different but has a similar song.

The blackcap breeds in much of Europe, western Asia and northwestern Africa, and its preferred habitat is mature deciduous woodland. The male holds a territory when breeding, which is defended against garden warblers as well as other blackcaps. The nest is a neat cup, built low in brambles or scrub, and the clutch is typically 4–6 mainly buff eggs, which hatch in about 11 days. The chicks fledge in 11–12 days, but are cared for by both adults for some time after leaving the nest. The blackcap is a partial migrant; birds from the colder areas of its range winter in scrub or trees in northwestern Europe, around the Mediterranean and in tropical Africa. Some birds from Germany and western continental Europe have adapted to spending the winter in gardens in Great Britain and Ireland. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, but, for the rest of the year, blackcaps survive primarily on small fruit. Garden birds also eat bread, fat and peanuts in winter.

Despite extensive hunting in Mediterranean countries and the natural hazards of predation and disease, the blackcap has been extending its range for several decades, and is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as least concern. Its rich and varied song has led to it being described as the &quot;mock nightingale&quot; and it has featured in literature, films and music. In Messiaen&#x27;s opera &quot;Saint François d&#x27;Assise&quot;, the saint is represented by themes based on the blackcap&#x27;s song.

== Taxonomy ==

The genus &quot;Sylvia&quot;, the typical warblers, forms part of a large family of Old World warblers, the Sylviidae. The blackcap and its nearest relative, the garden warbler, are an ancient species pair which diverged very early from the rest of the genus at between 12 and 16 million years ago. In the course of time, these two species have become sufficiently distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera, with the blackcap in subgenus &quot;Sylvia&quot; and the garden warbler in &quot;Epilais&quot;. These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other &quot;Sylvia&quot; species except the lesser whitethroat and common whitethroat. The nearest relatives of the garden warbler outside the sister group are believed to be the African hill babbler and Dohrn&#x27;s thrush-babbler, both of which should probably be placed in &quot;Sylvia&quot; rather than their current genera, &quot;Pseudoalcippe&quot; and &quot;Horizorhinus&quot; respectively.

The blackcap was one of the many bird species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, as &quot;Motacilla atricapilla&quot;. The current genus name is from Modern Latin &quot;silvia&quot;, a woodland sprite, related to &quot;silva&quot;, a wood. The species name, like the English name, refers to the male&#x27;s black cap. &quot;Atricapilla&quot; is from the Latin &quot;ater&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, and &quot;capillus&quot;, &quot;hair (of the head)&quot;.

Fossils and subfossils of the blackcap have been found in a number of European countries; the oldest, dated to 1.2–1.0 million years ago, are from the Early Pleistocene of Bulgaria. Fossils from France show that the genus &quot;Sylvia&quot; dates back at least 20 million years.

=== Subspecies ===

The differences between subspecies are small, making subspecific boundaries hard to define, and the exact distribution of &quot;S. a. heineken&quot; is unclear, since birds from northwest Africa may be of this form. About 2% of male blackcaps on Madeira and the Azores are melanistic, with black plumage on the whole head and upper breast. Melanistic females are rarer, and are characterised by grey-brown underparts. This dark morph has also been recorded from the Canary Islands, but not from Cape Verde. The melanistic birds were formerly sometimes considered to be a distinct subspecies, &quot;S. a. obscura&quot;.

== Description ==
The blackcap is a mainly grey warbler with distinct male and female plumages. The nominate subspecies is about long with a wing length. The weight is typically , but can be up to for birds preparing to migrate. The adult male has olive-grey upperparts, other than a paler grey nape and a neat black cap on the head. The underparts are light grey, becoming silvery white on the chin, throat and upper breast. The tail is dark grey, with an olive tint to the outer edge of each feather. The bill and long legs are grey, and the iris is reddish brown. The female resembles the male, but has a reddish-brown cap and a slightly browner tone to the grey of the upperparts. Juveniles are similar to the female, but their upperparts have a slight rufous tinge, and the breast and flanks have a more olive tone; young males have a darker brown cap than their female counterparts. This species is unmistakable; other dark-headed &quot;Sylvia&quot; species, such Sardinian and Orphean warblers have extensive black on the head instead of a small cap. They are also larger and have white edges on the tail.

Blackcaps have a complete moult in their breeding areas in August and September prior to migration. Some birds, typically those migrating the greatest distances, have a further partial moult between December and March. Juveniles replace their loosely structured body feathers with adult plumage, starting earlier, but taking longer to complete, than the adults. Blackcaps breeding in the north of the range have an earlier and shorter post-juvenile moult than those further south, and cross-breeding of captive birds shows that the timing is genetically controlled.

=== Voice ===


The male&#x27;s song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, which is given in bursts of up to 30 seconds. The song is repeated for about two-and-a-half minutes, with a short pause before each repetition. In some geographically isolated areas, such as islands, peninsulas and valleys in the Alps, a simplified fluting song occurs, named the &quot;Leiern&quot; (drawling) song by the German ornithologists who first described it. The song&#x27;s introduction is like that of other blackcaps, but the final warbling part is a simple alternation between two notes, as in a great tit&#x27;s call but more fluting. The main song is confusable with that of the garden warbler, but it is slightly higher pitched than in that species, more broken into discrete song segments, and less mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is even harder to separate. The blackcap occasionally mimics the song of other birds, the most frequently copied including the garden warbler and the common nightingale. The main call is a hard &quot;tac-tac&quot;, like stones knocking together, and other vocalisations include a squeaking &quot;sweet&quot; alarm, and a low-pitched trill similar to that of a garden warbler.

Male blackcaps will sometimes sing even when incubating, especially with the second brood. This appears to be intended to maintain the bond with the female. Wintering birds in Africa are quiet initially, but start singing in January or February prior to their return north.

== Distribution and habitat ==

===Distribution===

The continental breeding range of the blackcap lies between the 14–30° July isotherms, and is occupied by the nominate subspecies, the other forms being restricted to islands or fringe areas in the Caucasus and eastern Iberia. Birds on the Mediterranean and Atlantic islands and in the milder west and south of the main Eurasian distribution often winter within the nesting range, but populations elsewhere are migratory. The blackcap is a leap-frog migrant; birds from the north of the breeding range travel furthest south, whereas Mediterranean breeders move much shorter distances. The wintering areas overlap with the breeding range, but also include extensive areas in West Africa, East Africa south to Lake Malawi, and further north in Ethiopia, South Sudan and Eritrea. The large majority of birds wintering in eastern Africa are of the southwest Asian race, &quot;S. a. dammholzi&quot;.

There is a migratory divide in Europe at longitude 10–11°E. Birds to the west of this line head southwest towards Iberia or West Africa, whereas populations to the east migrate to the eastern Mediterranean and on to East Africa. Cross-breeding in captivity of birds from the resident population on the Canary Islands with migratory blackcaps from Germany showed the urge to migrate is genetically controlled, the offspring showing intermediate behaviour in terms of restlessness at migration time. Similar experiments using birds from southern Germany and eastern Austria, on opposite sides of the migratory divide, demonstrated that the direction of migration is also genetically determined. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.

In recent decades, substantial numbers of continental European birds have taken to wintering in gardens in Great Britain, and, to a lesser extent, Ireland, where the blackcap was formerly just a summer visitor. Although the British climate is sub-optimal, compensatory factors include the ready availability of food, (particularly from bird tables), a shorter migration distance, and the avoidance of the Alps and the Sahara Desert.

It was originally thought that most of these wintering birds come from Germany, and isotope analysis (which enables the wintering location to be determined) showed that the continental birds wintering in Britain tend to mate only among themselves, and do not usually interbreed with those wintering in the Mediterranean or western Africa. This is because the British migrants arrive back on the breeding grounds earlier than blackcaps wintering around the Mediterranean, and form pairs before the southern birds arrive. Mixed pairings are also selected against because the hybrid young would migrate in an intermediate direction, which would take them into the Bay of Biscay.

It now appears that the wintering birds in the UK come from a much wider area than previously thought. The majority come from France, and some individuals come from as far away as Spain and Poland. The steady supply of winter food in gardens gives even Spanish-breeding birds an opportunity to put on weight quicker than in their home range.

A 2021 paper showed that blackcaps, particularly adults, wintering in Britain and Ireland showed high site fidelity and low movement between wintering sites, in contrast to blackcaps wintering in their traditional winter ranges. Adults that frequented gardens had better body condition, smaller fat stores, longer bills, and rounder wing tips. The bill and wing tip shapes reflected a more generalist diet than that of birds in traditional winter sites.

Blackcaps did not exclusively feed in gardens; visits were linked to harsher weather. Individuals generally stayed at garden sites until immediately before spring departure, and supplemental feeding may have benefits for winter survival, When preparing for migration, abundant supplemental food may allow blackcaps to attain better body condition and may facilitate earlier and more successful breeding attempts.

In the Iberian Peninsula, migratory blackcaps (and European robins) track similar climatic conditions over the season, which sedentary individuals must cope with great variation in climate over the year. This suggests a trade-off between the cost of travelling long distances of migrants, and the flexibility required by sedentary individuals to tolerate a wide variety of environmental conditions.

===Habitat===

The blackcap&#x27;s main breeding habitat is mature deciduous woodland, with good scrub cover below the trees. Other habitats, such as parks, large gardens and overgrown hedges, are used as long as they meet the essential requirements of tall trees for songposts and an established understory. Where other &quot;Sylvia&quot; warblers also breed, blackcaps tend to use taller trees than their relatives, preferably those with a good canopy, such as pedunculate oak. In prime habitat, breeding densities reach 100–200 pairs per square kilometre (250–500 pairs per square mile) in northern Europe, and 500–900 pairs per square kilometre (1,250–2,250 pairs per square mile) in Italy. Densities are much lower in poorer habitats such as conifer forests. Breeding occurs in Europe at altitudes up to .

The preferred winter habitat around the Mediterranean is scrub and olive orchards, where densities approach the levels found in the best breeding areas. The British wintering population is atypical, with 95% found in gardens, mostly in towns at altitudes below . In Africa, habitats include cultivated land, acacia scrub, mangroves and forest, and these warblers are found at altitudes up to in the east of the continent. Wintering birds wander in search of good fruit supplies, but often stay in good feeding areas, and return in subsequent winters. Migrants may occur in a wide variety of habitats, such as reed bed and fen, but show a preference for shrubland.

== Behaviour ==

=== Territory ===
When male blackcaps return to their breeding areas, they establish a territory. Adults that have previously bred return to the site they have used in previous summers, whereas inexperienced birds either wander until they find a suitable area, or establish a very large initial territory which contracts under pressure from neighbours. Territorial boundaries are established initially by loud singing, performed while the male displays with his crown raised, tail fanned and slow wingbeats. This display is followed, if necessary, by a chase, often leading to a fight. The typical territory size in a French study was , but in insect-rich tall maquis in Gibraltar, the average was only . Females feed within a home range which may overlap other blackcap territories, and covers up to six times the area of the defended zone.

&quot;Sylvia&quot; warblers are unusual in that they vigorously defend their territories against other members of their genus as well as conspecifics. Blackcaps and garden warblers use identical habits in the same wood, yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap. Similar songs are a feature of the &quot;Sylvia&quot; warblers as a group, and it has been suggested that this promotes interspecific competition and helps to segregate territories between related species. It appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species, other than the blackcap and garden warbler, is due to subtle habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression.

=== Breeding ===

Blackcaps first breed when they are one year old, and are mainly monogamous, although both sexes may sometimes deviate from this. A male attracts a female to his territory through song and a display involving raising the black crown feathers, fluffing the tail, slow wingbeats, and a short flapping flight. He also builds one or more simple nests (cock nests), usually near his songpost. The final nest, which may be one of the cock nests or built from scratch, is a neat cup of roots, stems and grasses lined with fine material such as hair. The nest is typically deep and across, and is built in the cover of bramble, scrubs or trees. It is constructed mainly by the female, and may be up to above the ground, although lower than is more typical. The clutch is typically 4–6 eggs (range 2–7), which are usually buff with grey and brown blotches and a few dark brown spots. The average size of the egg is .

The eggs are incubated for an average of 11 days (range 10–16). Both adults incubate, although only the female stays on the nest at night. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 11–12 days after hatching, leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly. They are assisted with feeding for a further two or three weeks. If the nest is threatened, the non-incubating bird gives an alarm call so that the sitting parent and chicks stay still and quiet. A male blackcap may mob a potential predator, or try to lure it away with disjointed runs and flaps on the ground. The blackcap normally raises just one brood, but second nestings are sometimes recorded, particularly in the milder climate of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic islands; triple brooding has been observed once, the female laying a total of 23 eggs in the season.

Of eggs laid, 65–93% hatch successfully, and 75–92% of the chicks go on to fledge. The productivity (young fledged per nest) varies with location, level of predation and quality of habitat, but the national figure for the UK was 2.5. The adult annual survival rate is 43% (males 46%, females 29%), and 36% of juveniles live through their first year. The typical life expectancy is two years, but the record is 13 years and 10 months for a bird in the Czech Republic.

===Feeding===

The blackcap feeds mainly on insects during the breeding season, then switches to fruit in late summer, the change being triggered by an internal biological rhythm. When migrants arrive on their territories they initially take berries, pollen and nectar if there are insufficient insects available, then soon switch to their preferred diet. They mainly pick prey off foliage and twigs, but may occasionally hover, flycatch or feed on the ground. Blackcaps eat a wide range of invertebrate prey, although aphids are particularly important early in the season, and flies, beetles and caterpillars are also taken in large numbers. Small snails are swallowed whole, since the shell is a source of calcium for the bird&#x27;s eggs. Chicks are mainly fed soft-bodied insects, fruit only if invertebrates are scarce.

In July, the diet switches increasingly to fruit. The protein needed for egg-laying and for the chicks to grow is replaced by fruit sugar which helps the birds to fatten for migration. Aphids are still taken while they are available, since they often contain sugars from the plant sap on which they feed. Blackcaps eat a wide range of small fruit, and squeeze out any seeds on a branch before consuming the pulp. This technique makes them an important propagator of mistletoe. The mistle thrush, which also favours that plant, is less beneficial since it tends to crush the seeds. Although any suitable fruit may be eaten, some have seasonal or local importance; elder makes up a large proportion of the diet of northern birds preparing for migration, and energy-rich olives and lentisc are favoured by blackcaps wintering in the Mediterranean.

The continental birds wintering in British gardens rely on provided food, and the major items are bread and fat, each making up around 20% of the diet; one bird survived the whole winter eating only Christmas cake. Fruit is also eaten, notably cotoneaster (41% of the fruit consumed), ivy and honeysuckle, and apple if available. Some birds have learned to take peanuts from feeders. Blackcaps defend good winter food sources in the wild, and at garden feeding stations they repel competitors as large as starlings and blackbirds. Birds occasionally become tame enough to feed from the hand.

== Predators and parasites ==

Blackcaps are caught by Eurasian sparrowhawks in the breeding range, and by Eleonora&#x27;s falcons on migration. Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take eggs and young, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels. Domestic cats are the most important predator, possibly killing up to 10% of blackcaps. Blackcaps are occasionally hosts of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The level of parasitism is low because the cuckoo&#x27;s eggs are often rejected. Blackcaps have evolved adaptations which make it difficult for the parasitic species to succeed, despite the cuckoo&#x27;s tendency to lay eggs which resemble those of their host. Blackcaps are good at spotting alien eggs, and their own eggs are very alike within a clutch, making it easier to spot the intruder. There is, however, considerable variation between different clutches, making it harder for the cuckoo to convincingly mimic a blackcap egg. The open habitat and cup nest of the warbler make it a potential target for the cuckoo; it may have experienced much higher levels of parasitism in the past, and countermeasures would have spread rapidly once they evolved.

The only blood parasites found in a study of blackcaps trapped on migration were protozoans from the genera &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; and &quot;Plasmodium&quot;. The study concluded that 45.5% of the males and 22.7% of the females were affected, but the number of parasites was small, and the ability to store fat for the migration flight was unimpaired. Seventeen strains of &quot;H. parabelopolskyi&quot; are found only in the blackcap, and form a monophyletic group; three further members of that group are found only in the garden warbler, and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species. The protozoan &quot;Isospora ashmoonensis&quot; was first identified in a blackcap in Egypt. Blackcaps may carry parasitic worms that sometimes kill their hosts. External parasites include chewing lice and feather mites. The latter do little damage, although heavy infestations cause individual tail feathers to develop asymmetrically.

== In culture ==
Aristotle, in his &quot;History of Animals&quot;, considered that the garden warbler eventually metamorphosed into a blackcap. The blackcap&#x27;s song has led to it being described as the &quot;mock nightingale&quot; or &quot;country nightingale&quot;, and John Clare, in &quot;The March Nightingale&quot; describes the listener as believing that the rarer species has arrived prematurely. &quot;He stops his own and thinks the nightingale/Hath of her monthly reckoning counted wrong&quot;. The song is also the topic of Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli&#x27;s &quot;La Capinera&quot; [The Blackcap].

Giovanni Verga&#x27;s 1871 novel &quot;Storia di una capinera&quot;, according to its author, was inspired by a story of a blackcap trapped and caged by children. The bird, silent and pining for its lost freedom, eventually dies. In the book, a nun evacuated from her convent by cholera falls in love with a family friend, only to have to return to her confinement when the disease wanes. The novel was adapted as films of the same name in 1917, 1943 and 1993. The last version was directed by Franco Zeffirelli, and its English-language version was retitled as &quot;Sparrow&quot;. In &quot;Saint François d&#x27;Assise&quot;, an opera by Messiaen, the orchestration is based on bird song. St Francis himself is represented by the blackcap.

In Finland, a caged blackcap is featured in a Christmas song &quot;Sylvian Joululaulu&quot; (compare with the Latin name &quot;Sylvia atricapilla&quot;), and is said to represent Finland before it claimed independence from Russia in 1917.

Folk names for the blackcap often refer to its most obvious plumage feature (black-headed peggy, King Harry black cap and coal hoodie) or to its song, as in the &quot;nightingale&quot; names above. Other old names are based on its choice of nesting material (Jack Straw, hay bird, hay chat and hay Jack). There is a tradition of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm bases being named for birds. A former base near Stretton in Cheshire was called HMS &quot;Blackcap&quot;.

== Status ==

The blackcap has a very large range, and its population in Europe is estimated at 41–65 million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Africa and Asia, the total population estimate is between 101 and 161 million individuals. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.

Blackcaps and other small birds are illegally trapped and hunted in large numbers in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a delicacy. Despite hunting and natural hazards, the European population of the blackcap has been rising for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as in northern Israel and the Faroes, and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland or on the islands of Arctic Russia. In the Baltic, the spread of the blackcap appears to have been helped by the availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining barred warbler.

<text>The garden warbler (Sylvia borin) is a common and widespread small bird that breeds in most of Europe and in the Palearctic to western Siberia. It is a plain, long-winged and long-tailed typical warbler with brown upperparts and dull white underparts; the sexes are similar and juveniles resemble the adults. Its two subspecies differ only slightly and interbreed where their ranges overlap. Due to its lack of distinguishing features, this species can be confused with a number of other unstreaked warblers. The garden warbler&#x27;s rich melodic song is similar to that of the blackcap, its closest relative, which competes with it for territory when nesting in the same woodland.

The preferred breeding habitat in Eurasia is open woodland with dense low cover for nesting; despite its name, gardens are rarely occupied by this small passerine bird. The clutch of four or five blotched cream or white eggs is laid in a robust cup-shaped nest built near the ground and concealed by dense vegetation. The eggs are incubated for 11–12 days. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 10 days after hatching. Only about a quarter of young birds survive their first year. The garden warbler is strongly migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. A wide range of habitats are used in Africa, but closed forest and treeless Sahel are both shunned. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, although fruit predominates when birds are fattening prior to migration, figs being a particular favourite where available. These warblers have a mixed diet of insects and fruit in their African wintering grounds.

The garden warbler is hunted by Eurasian sparrowhawks and domestic cats, and its eggs and nestlings are taken by a variety of mammalian and avian predators. It may be host to various fleas, mites and internal parasites, and it is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The large and fairly stable numbers and huge range of the garden warbler mean that it is classed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Despite a small population decline in much of its European range, the bird&#x27;s breeding distribution is expanding northwards in Scandinavia.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Sylvia&quot;, the typical warblers, forms part of a large family of Old World warblers, the Sylviidae. Fossils from France show that the genus dates back at least 20 million years. The garden warbler and its nearest relative, the blackcap, are an ancient species pair which diverged very early from the rest of the genus, between 12 and 16 million years ago. In the course of time, these two species have become sufficiently distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera, with the blackcap in subgenus &quot;Sylvia&quot; and the garden warbler in &quot;Epilais&quot;. These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other &quot;Sylvia&quot; species except the lesser whitethroat and common whitethroat.

The nearest relatives of the garden warbler outside the sister group are believed to be the African hill babbler and Dohrn&#x27;s thrush-babbler.

The garden warbler was given the binomial name &quot;Motacilla borin&quot; by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert in 1783. The current genus name is from Modern Latin &quot;silvia&quot;, a woodland nymph, related to &quot;silva&quot;, a wood. The specific &quot;borin&quot; is derived from a local name for the bird in the Genoa area of Italy; it derives from the Latin &quot;bos&quot;, ox, because the warbler was believed to accompany oxen.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries there was some uncertainty as to the correct authority for this species. Various names were used including &quot;Sylvia salicaria&quot; Linnaeus 1766, and &quot;Sylvia simplex&quot; Latham 1787. Confusingly, the species was also known as &quot;Sylvia hortensis&quot; Bechstein 1802, where &quot;hortensis&quot; is the specific epithet of the western Orphean warbler.

There are two recognised subspecies.

* &quot;Sylvia borin borin&quot; (Boddaert, 1783), the nominate subspecies, breeds in western, northern and central Europe to Finland, central Poland, western Hungary and Bosnia.
* &quot;S. b. woodwardi&quot; (Sharpe, 1877), named for Sharpe&#x27;s collaborator Bernard Barham Woodward, breeds in eastern Europe and temperate Asia east to western Siberia.

Intermediate birds occur where the recognised forms meet and interbreed, and have sometimes been given subspecies status, including &quot;S. b. kreczmeri&quot; in Poland and &quot;S. b. pateffi&quot; in Bulgaria, but these are not generally accepted as valid taxa.

== Description ==
The garden warbler is long with a wing length. The weight is typically , but can be up to for birds preparing to migrate. It is a plain, long-winged and long-tailed bird with unstreaked olive-brown upperparts and dull white underparts. It has a whitish eyering and a faint pale supercilium, and there is a buff wash to the throat and flanks. The eye is black, the legs are bluish-grey and the strong bill has a grey upper and paler grey lower mandible. The male and female are indistinguishable by external appearance including size. Juveniles have a looser plumage than an adult, with paler and greyer upperparts and a buff tone to the underparts. The eastern subspecies &quot;S. b. woodwardi&quot; is slightly larger and paler than the nominate form with a greyer tone to the upperparts and whiter underparts. The subspecies are hard to distinguish visually where they occur together in Africa, but a wing length greater than confirms &quot;S. b. woodwardi&quot; when birds are trapped.

The plain appearance of the garden warbler means that it can be confused with several other species. The melodious and icterine warblers usually have long bills and a yellowish tint to their plumage. The booted warbler is similar in colour, although it is smaller, more delicately built and has a flesh-coloured bill. Western and eastern olivaceous warblers are also relatively small, and have white outer tail feathers as well as a pinkish bill. Juvenile barred warblers, which lack the obvious barring of adults, are much larger than garden warblers and have a pale double wingbar.

Juvenile garden warblers have a partial moult mainly involving the body plumage between June and September prior to migration. Adults also have a similar, but sometimes more extensive, partial moult in late summer, and a complete moult in their African wintering areas before the return migration.

=== Voice ===
The male&#x27;s song, usually delivered by birds in dense cover, is a rich musical warbling usually delivered in bursts of a few seconds duration, but sometimes for longer periods. The song is confusable with that of the blackcap, although compared to that species it is slightly lower-pitched, less broken into discrete song segments and more mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is much more difficult to separate. The most frequent call of the garden warbler is a sharp &quot;kek-kek&quot;, which is repeated rapidly when the bird is alarmed. A quiet rasping &quot;tchurr-r-r-r&quot; resembling the main call of the common whitethroat is also sometimes heard. The juvenile has a &quot;quia&quot; alarm vocalisation. Subsong may be heard on the wintering grounds in Africa, developing into the full song in March and April prior to the return to Europe.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The garden warbler breeds in most of Europe between the isotherms and east across temperate Asia to the Yenisei River in Siberia. Its range extends further north than any other &quot;Sylvia&quot; warbler. All populations are migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa as far south as South Africa. Birds from central Europe initially migrate to the southwest, reorientating to the south or southeast once in Africa, although Scandinavian migrants may head south through the Alps and across the Mediterranean Sea. &quot;S. b. woodwardi&quot; reaches Africa by a more easterly route, many birds passing through the Arabian Peninsula. When garden warblers cross the Sahara, they fly at night, resting motionless and without feeding in suitable shade during the day. During their journey, they can metabolise not only body fat but also up to 19% of their breast and leg muscles and 39% of their digestive tract. Many birds pause for a few days to feed after the desert crossing before continuing further south.

The nominate subspecies occurs in the western and central parts of the winter range, although some birds occur as far east as Kenya. &quot;S. b. woodwardi&quot; winters in eastern and southern Africa. Movements in Africa are poorly known, although at least some birds return to the same location in subsequent years. There are only a handful of records of birds recorded in Europe in winter, from Corsica, the UK and Ireland. Spring migration routes are poorly known, but appear to lie more directly across the Mediterranean. This warbler has occurred as a vagrant in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Iceland, São Tomé and Príncipe, Somalia, Yemen, Svalbard, Jan Mayen and Madeira.

The breeding habitat of the garden warbler is open areas with dense bushes, including thickets and woodland edges. Shady areas and a bushy or herbaceous undergrowth are preferred, as are woods adjacent to rivers or reed beds; in Ireland it favours thickets on the shores of small lakes. A tolerance of willow, alder and birch allows it to breed farther north and at higher altitudes than any other European &quot;Sylvia&quot; warbler. Mature conifers and dense plantations are avoided, although young conifer plantations with thick undergrowth are suitable for nesting. Despite its name, it is not a bird of gardens. In Africa, a wide range of habitats with trees are used, although closed forests and arid areas are again avoided. This warbler occurs at altitudes of up to in suitable mountain woodland, although in East Africa it is usually found at a lower altitude than the blackcap, and in moister areas than the common whitethroat.

== Behaviour ==
=== Breeding ===

Garden warblers first breed when they are one year old, and are mainly monogamous, although the male at least may sometimes deviate from this. When males return to their breeding areas, they establish a territory. &quot;Sylvia&quot; warblers are unusual in that they vigorously defend their territories against other species in their genus as well as conspecifics. Blackcaps and garden warblers use identical habits in the same woods, yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap. Similar songs are a feature of the &quot;Sylvia&quot; warblers as a group, and it has been suggested that this promotes interspecific competition and helps to segregate territories between related species. However, it appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species, other than the blackcap and garden warbler, is due to subtle differences in habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression. There are typically 3–9 territories per hectare (1.2–3.6 per acre), but in prime habitat, such as moist willow or birch woodland or young deciduous regrowth, there may be more than 10 pairs per hectare (4 per acre). Individual territories are similar in size to those of blackcaps at .

A male attracts a female to his territory through song and a display which involves rapid wing beating while perched. He will also build a number of simple nests (cock&#x27;s nests) to show to his mate, although only rarely will she complete the structure, usually starting afresh. The nest is concealed in vegetation, the nature of which depends on local availability. &quot;Rubus&quot; species are commonly used in temperate regions, with willow predominating in alpine valleys. Sometimes, particularly in stinging nettles, the nest may be built around a number of vertical stems, in the manner of a reed warbler. The nest is normally between above the ground, and very rarely higher than . The nest is a cup of dry grass, moss and twigs, with a soft lining of finer plant material or hair. It is larger and heavier than a blackcap&#x27;s nest, averaging high and wide with a cup deep and wide.
The first eggs are laid in late April in southern Germany, early May in northwest Europe, and late May in Finland. The season is prolonged with some birds nesting as late as July. The clutch is typically four or five eggs (range two to six), which are usually whitish or buff with grey, purple and brown blotches. The average size of the egg is , and it weighs , of which 6% is shell. The eggs are incubated for 11–12 days by both adults, although only the female stays on the nest at night. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 10 days after hatching (range 9–12), leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly. They are assisted with feeding for a further two weeks, and the family may stay together for a few days after that. The short incubation and fledging times may be a result of predation pressure, the rapid development of the chicks enabling them to leave the vulnerable nest as early as possible, even while still flightless. This avoids the possible loss of an entire brood, but means that the adults must provide food to the young for a significant period until they can fend for themselves. One brood per year is normal, although a few second broods are known.

The southward migration starts in mid-July, with larger numbers departing in August and peaking in early September. Most adults have gone by mid-September, although juveniles may linger for another month.

On average, just over 50% of breeding pairs are successful in producing at least one fledged young from a nest, with early breeding and low population density being factors increasing success. In the UK, more than 50% of the failures are due to predation and about 30% result from food shortages in bad weather. The annual survival rate is about 50% for adults and 26% for juveniles in their first year. The typical lifespan is two years, but a bird in Sweden lived to ten years and two months. Much greater ages, up to 24 years, have been recorded in captive garden warblers.

=== Feeding ===

The garden warbler feeds mainly on insects in the breeding season, although other small invertebrates such as spiders are also eaten. It picks its prey off leaves and twigs, sometimes hovering to do so. It normally forages at less than above the ground. After nesting, there is a genetically controlled switch to a fruit diet, although insects are still consumed while the birds fatten prior to migration; birds gain weight more rapidly from a diet containing both fruit and insects than either alone. Berries and other soft fruit are preferred, and figs are particularly important for birds preparing to migrate. This predilection gives rise to the Italian &quot;beccafico&quot; (fig pecker) and Portuguese &quot;felosa-das-figueiras&quot; (fig-tree warbler) as names for this species. On this diet a bird can gain weight quickly and the liver increases the rate at which it produces fatty acids for storage in adipose tissue.

In Africa, the warbler eats insects as well as berries, and the fruits of the introduced Spanish flag is a favourite where present. An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds fattening even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey. Most internal organs (including the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys and heart) and the flight muscles lose weight during the journey over the Sahara, although the testes quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season. Unlike drier-habitat species like the common whitethroat, they leave from savanna rather than the treeless Sahel further north.

Fruit is normally picked by a perched bird, although there is a record of a mulberry fruit being taken in flight. Garden warblers often feed with conspecifics and other fruit-eating passerines. Over 35 plant species have been recorded as food for this warbler just in central Europe, with many additional species being consumed in the Mediterranean region and on the African wintering grounds.

== Predators and parasites ==
The main predators of the garden warbler are Eurasian sparrowhawks and domestic cats. Some falcons will also take adults, and the Eleonora&#x27;s falcon hunts the garden warbler and many other small passerines as they migrate across the Mediterranean. Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take the eggs and young of warblers, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels. The garden warbler is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The blackcap has a much lower level of parasitism than its relative because the cuckoo&#x27;s eggs are often rejected.

External parasites of the garden warbler include the fleas &quot;Ceratophyllus gallinae&quot; and &quot;Dasypsyllus gallinulae&quot; and the mite &quot;Syringophilosis borini&quot;, named after its host. Two species of protozoan parasites in the genus &quot;Isospora&quot; occur in garden warblers, &quot;I. sylvianthina&quot; and &quot;I. sylviae&quot;. Samples from two sites showed infection levels above 74% and 28% respectively for the two species. The extent of infection does not impact on the bird&#x27;s body mass or the amount of body fat. Three strains of another protozoan, &quot;Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi&quot; are found only in the garden warbler, and form a monophyletic group. Seventeen further members of that group are found only in the blackcap, and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species.

== Status ==
The garden warbler has a very large range of , and its population in Europe is estimated at 17–31 million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Asia, the total population is between 54 and 124 million individuals. There is no evidence of any serious decline in numbers, so it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.

There has been a slight decline in numbers in Europe since 1980, although the Scandinavian population is growing. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.

== In culture ==
In his &quot;History of Animals&quot;, Aristotle considered that the garden warbler eventually metamorphosed into a blackcap. The composer Olivier Messiaen used the song of the garden warbler as the basis for his 1971 solo piano piece &quot;La fauvette des jardins&quot;, the title being the French name of the species. His Turangalîla-Symphonie, a major work inspired by the legend of Tristan and Iseult, has a summer garden scene as its sixth movement. This features the song of the warbler, along with those of the nightingale and blackbird.

The garden warbler is prized as a gastronomic delicacy in Mediterranean countries. French epicure Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin said of the warbler when cooked like ortolan bunting &quot;if it were the size of a pheasant, it would be worth an acre of land&quot;. An Italian stuffed sardine dish &quot;sarde a beccafico&quot; derives its name from its supposed resemblance to the cooked birds, known in that country as &quot;beccafico&quot;, fig-pecker.

Old names for the garden warbler, such as strawsmear, small straw and haychat, are often derived from its choice of nesting material, although the commonest of the English folk names was &quot;pettychaps&quot;. These names were often shared with other warblers including the blackcap, common whitethroat and common chiffchaff.

<text>The barred warbler (Curruca nisoria) is a typical warbler which breeds across temperate regions of central and eastern Europe and western and central Asia. This passerine bird is strongly migratory, and winters in tropical eastern Africa.

It is the largest &quot;Curruca&quot; warbler, 15.5–17 cm in length and weighing 22–36 g, mainly grey above and whitish below. Adult males are dark grey above with white tips on the wing coverts and tail feathers, and heavily barred below. The female is similar but slightly paler and has only light barring. Young birds are buffy grey-brown above, pale buff below, and have very little barring, with few obvious distinctive features; they can easily be confused with garden warblers, differing in the slight barring on the tail coverts and the pale fringes on the wing feathers, and their slightly larger size. The eye has a yellow iris in adults, dark in immatures; the bill is blackish with a paler base, and the legs stout, grey-brown.

==Taxonomy==
Within the genus &quot;Curruca&quot; it is highly distinctive; the barred underside is shared only with the Cyprus warbler, which has black barring and an entirely different overall colour pattern. The barred warbler seems to represent an ancient lineage of &quot;Curruca&quot; warblers on its own and does not appear to have any particularly close relatives in the genus.

Two subspecies are recognised. The nominate &quot;Curruca nisoria nisoria&quot; occurs over most of the species&#x27; range, while &quot;Curruca nisoria merzbacheri&quot; occurs at eastern end of the range in central Asia. The latter is marginally paler and less heavily barred than the nominate subspecies, but they are barely distinct and intergrade where the ranges meet. Some authors consider them synonymous.

The specific &quot;nisoria&quot; is Medieval Latin for the Eurasian sparrowhawk, which is also barred.

==Ecology==

The barred warbler is a bird of open country with bushes for nesting, with very similar habitat preferences to the red-backed shrike. The nest is built in low shrub or brambles, and three to seven eggs are laid. Like most warblers, it is mainly insectivorous, but also takes berries and other soft fruit extensively in late summer and autumn. Its song is a pleasant chattering like a garden warbler with many clear notes, but is harsher and less melodious, and slightly higher pitched, with some resemblance to the common whitethroat&#x27;s song.

==Occurrence==

The European population is estimated at around 460,000 pairs. It has declined in some areas, particularly at the western end of its breeding range in Denmark (where it is now extinct as a breeding bird) and Germany, due to habitat loss from agricultural intensification; conversely, some increase has occurred in Ukraine and southern Finland. Further east, numbers are currently stable. Population densities range between 1–20 pairs per 10 ha in Germany, up to 30 pairs per 10 ha recorded in Kazakhstan.

Barred warblers are regular on autumn passage as far west as Great Britain (typically 100-200 records annually), where it occurs mainly on the east coast between late August and late October, and more rarely to Ireland (around 10–20 records annually); spring passage records in Britain are very rare (1–3 per decade). The vast majority of British and Irish records are of first-year birds, with adults occurring only exceptionally rarely.

<text>Portlets are pluggable user interface software components that are managed and displayed in a web portal. A portlet responds to requests from a web client with and generates dynamic content. A portlet is managed by a portlet container.

== Description ==
A portlet is a pluggable user interface software component that is managed and displayed in a web portal, for example an enterprise portal or a web CMS. A portlet can aggregate (integrate) and personalize content from different sources within a web page. A portlet responds to requests from a web client with and generates dynamic content.

Portlets produce fragments of markup (HTML, XHTML, WML) that are aggregated into a portal. Hence, a portlet (or collection of portlets) resembles a web-based application that is hosted in a portal. Some examples of portlet applications are e-mail, weather reports, discussion forums, and news.

=== Portlet containers ===
A portlet is managed by a portlet container. A portlet container runs portlets, provides them with the required runtime environment, manages their life cycles. A container also provides persistent storage mechanisms for the portlet preferences.

A portlet container receives requests from the portal to execute requests on the portlets hosted by it. A portlet container sends data to the portal for aggregation, but is not responsible for aggregating the content produced by the portlets; the portal itself handles aggregation. A portal and a portlet container can be built together as a single component of an application suite or as two separate components of a portal application.

== Standards ==

Portlet standards are platform independent application programming interfaces that are intended to enable software developers to create portlets that can be plugged into any portal supporting the standards. An example is the Java Portlet Specification.

<text>Bryonia is a genus of flowering plants in the gourd family. Bryony is its best-known common name. They are native to western Eurasia and adjacent regions, such as North Africa, the Canary Islands and South Asia.
==Description and ecology==

Bryonies are perennial, tendril-climbing, diclinous or dioecious herbs with palmately lobed leaves and flowers in axillary clusters. The fruit is a smooth, globular berry.

&quot;Bryonia&quot; is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), including the tortrix moth &quot;Phtheochroa rugosana&quot; (recorded on red bryony, &quot;B. dioica&quot;) and the cabbage moth (&quot;Mamestra brassicae&quot;). The horticultural value contributes to formation of pest and crop damage by the food plant consumption.

==Use by humans==
Bryonies are occasionally grown in gardens, sometimes accidentally, sometimes deliberately so. Some species find use in herbal medicine. Generally however, these plants are poisonous, some highly so, and may be fatal if ingested. Cucurbitacin glycosides are primarily responsible for the plants&#x27; bitterness and emetic effects.

Variants of the plants&#x27; name, such as Bryony, are used in some cultures as female given names. They were quite popular in the 18th century.

The Royal Navy of the United Kingdom named two ships HMS &quot;Bryony&quot; after the plant.

==Species==

Twelve species are currently accepted by the USDA:
Ten of these are supported in a molecular-phylogenetic analysis:
The only English species, &quot;B. dioica&quot; (red bryony), grows in hedgerows as far north as Yorkshire.

* &quot;Bryonia acuta&quot; (formerly sometimes included in &quot;B. cretica&quot;)
* &quot;Bryonia alba&quot; – white bryony

<text>The Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND; ) was a civilian commission within the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, responsible for setting policy for defense procurement. It was considered as the Chinese counterpart of DARPA of the US. The ministry was formed in 1982 to centralize Chinese defense procurement and technology whose responsibility had been distributed among several agencies. In March 2008, COSTIND was merged into a new ministry called the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and renamed as the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND). The final-term COSTIND deputy director, Chen Qiufa, was named as the head of SASTIND.

==History==
In the late-1990s, there was a massive reorganization of the Chinese defense industry. The main focus of this reorganization was to separate the purchasing of weaponry which became the responsibility of the General Armaments Division of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, the production and development of weaponry which became the responsibility of several different enterprises such as China Northern Industries and China Southern Industries which were state-owned but not under direct state management, and the development of policy for these industries which became the responsibility of COSTIND. Because of the massive change in COSTIND, many analysts referred to the new COSTIND and the old COSTIND.

COSTIND played an important role in the space program of China as one of its subagencies the China National Space Administration is responsible for Chinese space policy. COSTIND administered the China Engineering and Technology Information Network (CETIN), which has been described as a &quot;one-stop shop for foreign military technology information.&quot; French journalist Roger Faligot described COSTIND as an &quot;intelligence vacuum cleaner&quot; for collecting foreign scientific, technological, and industrial information.

According to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the China Atomic Energy Authority was part of COSTIND.

<text>Nougat ( , ;) is a family of confections made with sugar or honey, roasted nuts (almonds, walnuts, pistachios, hazelnuts, and macadamia nuts are common), whipped egg whites, and sometimes chopped candied fruit. The consistency of nougat is chewy, and it is used in a variety of candy bars and chocolates. The word &quot;nougat&quot; comes from Occitan (), which means &#x27;nutted&#x27; or &#x27;nutty&#x27;.

Three basic kinds of nougat exist. White nougat (also known as Persian nougat) is made with beaten egg whites and honey; it appeared in the early 7th century in Spain with Arabs. In Alicante, Spain there are several published recipes in the 16th century, for instance &quot;La Generosa Paliza&quot; by Lope de Rueda and other novels written by Cervantes and in Montélimar, France, in the 18th century (Nougat of Montélimar). Brown nougat is made without egg whites and has a firmer, often crunchy texture. Wiener nougat is also made without egg whites, but is soft and less chewy than French nougat.

==History==
Many legends exist around nougat&#x27;s origins. Early recipes of white nougat were found in a Middle Eastern book in Baghdad in the 10th century. That nougat was called &#x27;. One of these recipes indicates that the &#x27; comes from Harran, a city located between Urfa (now in southeast Turkey) and Aleppo, Syria. Mention of &#x27; was found in a triangle between Urfa, Aleppo, and Baghdad. At the end of the 10th century, the traveler and geographer Ibn Hawqal wrote that he ate some &#x27; in Manbij (in modern Syria) and Bukhara (in modern Uzbekistan).

==Distribution and popularity==
In southern Europe, nougat is a prominent component of Christmas meals.

&#x27; is produced in Spain; &quot;nougat&quot; in southern France; &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, and &quot;cubbaita&quot; in Cremona, Taurianova, and Sicily in Italy; &#x27; or &#x27; in Greece; &quot;mandolate&quot; or &quot;torrone&quot; in Brazil; &quot;mandulat&quot; in Dalmatia in Croatia; and &#x27; in Malta (where it is sold in village festivals). In Romania, it is known as &#x27; and is sold in local festivals and fairgrounds, mainly on the Sunday of Forgiveness preceding the Easter Lent); in a local variant form, it is made in Tabriz, Iran, where it is known as &quot;Luka&quot;. 

The nougat that appears in many candy bars in the United States and United Kingdom differs from traditional recipes and consists of sucrose and corn syrup aerated with a whipping agent (such as egg white, hydrolyzed soya protein or gelatine); it may also include vegetable fats and milk powder. Typically, it is combined with nuts, caramel, or chocolate. Some American confections feature this type of nougat as the primary component, rather than combined with other elements. Varieties of nougat are found in Milky Way, Reese&#x27;s Fast Break, Snickers, Double Decker, Zero, and Baby Ruth bars. &quot;Fluffy nougat&quot; is the featured ingredient in the 3 Musketeers bar.

In Britain, nougat is traditionally made in the style of the southern European varieties, and is commonly found at fairgrounds and seaside resorts. The most common industrially produced type is coloured pink and white, the pink often fruit flavoured, and sometimes wrapped in edible rice paper with almonds and cherries.

When nougat spread to Taiwan, preparers there began to add milk powder as the main ingredient, plus sugar, cream, protein (some companies use whey protein refined from fresh milk instead of protein and protein powder), nuts (such as peanuts, almonds, walnuts, pistachios or hazelnuts), dried fruit and petals (such as cranberry, golden pomelo, mango, orange, longan, and osmanthus). These secondary ingredients have become unique features of Taiwanese nougat. 

Compared to table-top nougat, French European nougat does not have any milk or milk powder ingredients. It is made by adding sugar or honey to egg whites and sprinkling in almonds or nuts. In addition, some manufacturers use edible rice paper to prevent the nougat from being deformed, which may affect the taste depending on the amount used.

==Variations==
Spanish nougat known as &quot;&quot; follows the traditional recipes with toasted nuts (commonly almonds), sugar, honey, and egg whites.

&#x27; from Italy includes these same basic ingredients as well as vanilla or citrus flavouring, and is often sandwiched between two very thin sheets of edible rice paper. The Venetian town of Cologna Veneta is well known for its nougat production, especially the type called &#x27; (&#x27; in Italian); this type is also based on honey, sugar, egg whites, and almonds but has a different flavour and is harder to bite than &#x27;.

Wiener (Viennese) nougat is a variant that contains only sugar, cocoa butter, nuts, and cocoa mass and has a mellow consistency. The nuts used for Viennese nougat are usually hazelnuts. In Germany and the Nordic countries, Viennese nougat is traditionally labelled as nougat, while in Sweden and Denmark, the original nougat is referred to as &quot;French nougat&quot;. In Germany, gianduja is traditionally called nougat.

<doc id="344613" wikidata="Q110257516" url="?curid=344613" title="Common whitethroat">
<text>The common whitethroat or greater whitethroat (Curruca communis) is a common and widespread typical warbler which breeds throughout Europe and across much of temperate western Asia. This small passerine bird is strongly migratory, and winters in tropical Africa, Arabia, and Pakistan.

==Taxonomy==
The English ornithologist John Latham described the common whitethroat in 1783 in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot; but introduced the binomial name &quot;Sylvia communis&quot; in the supplement to this work which was published in 1787. The specific &quot;communis&quot; is Latin for &quot;common&quot;. The common whitethroat is now placed in the genus &quot;Curruca&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1802.

This species may appear to be closely related to the lesser whitethroat, the species having evolved only during the end of the last ice age similar to the willow warbler and chiffchaffs. However, researchers found the presence of a white throat is an unreliable morphological marker for relationships in &quot;Curruca&quot;, and the greater and lesser whitethroats are not closely related. A molecular phylogenetic study of the Sylviidae published in 2011 found that within the genus &quot;Curruca&quot; the common whitethroat and the lesser whitethroat are members of different clades and are thus not sister species.

Four subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. c. communis&quot; (Latham, 1787) – breeds in Europe to north Turkey and north Africa; winters in west and central Africa
* &quot;C. c. volgensis&quot; (Domaniewski, 1915) – breeds in southeast European Russia, west Siberia and north Kazakhstan; winters in east and south Africa
* &quot;C. c. icterops&quot; (Ménétries, 1832) – breeds in central Turkey to Turkmenistan and Iran; winters in east and south Africa
* &quot;C. c. rubicola&quot; (Stresemann, 1928) – breeds in mountains of central Asia; winters in east and south Africa

==Description==
This is one of several &quot;Curruca&quot; species that has distinct male and female plumages. Both sexes are mainly brown above and buff below, with chestnut fringes to the secondary remiges. The adult male has a grey head and a white throat. The female lacks the grey head, and the throat is duller.

The whitethroat&#x27;s song is fast and scratchy, with a scolding tone. The hoarse, slightly nasal, call sounds like &quot;wed-wed&quot; or &quot;woid-woid&quot;. The warning cry is long-pulled, rough &quot;tschehr&quot; which resembles that of the Dartford warbler.

==Distribution and habitat==
This is a bird of open country and cultivation, with bushes for nesting. The nest is built in low shrub or brambles, and 3–7 eggs are laid. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous, but will also eat berries and other soft fruit.

In Europe, western and eastern populations of common whitethroats have contrasting moulting and pre-migratory fueling strategies to capitalise on food supplies before departing their breeding and non-breeding grounds.

<text>Casqui was a Native American polity visited in 1541 by the Hernando de Soto expedition. This group inhabited fortified villages in eastern Arkansas.

The tribe takes its name from the chieftain Casqui, who ruled the tribe from its primary village, thought to be located in present day Cross County, Arkansas near the town of Parkin. The suspected site is the focal point of the Parkin Archeological State Park and it has been determined that the site was continuously occupied for at least 500 years. Information about Chief Casqui and his people comes from journals made during the expedition of Hernando de Soto in 1541.

==Hernando de Soto Expedition==
When de Soto&#x27;s expedition arrived in the area the Casqui walked over a mile from their village to greet the travelers and invite them to stay in the town. The travelers declined the offer and made camp outside of the village. The journals report that de Soto gave a speech to the Casqui about religion and baptized several of the villagers as Christians. The journals report that the villagers helped them erect a large wooden cross on the central mound.

When de Soto determined to press on and visit the nearby tribe called the Pacaha many of the Casqui people followed him. The Casqui and the Pacaha had been at war for some time and the Casqui had raided the Pacaha on previous occasions. When de Soto and the Casqui approached, many of the Pacaha became afraid and attempted to flee to an island in the river and drowned. The Casqui who had followed de Soto proceeded to sack the village, desecrate holy sites, and steal everything they could.

De Soto contacted Chief Pacaha and convinced him that he had nothing to do with the attack and that the expedition&#x27;s intentions were peaceful. De Soto even assured the Pacaha that the expedition would help the Pacaha attack the Casqui to punish them for their subterfuge.

The Casqui received advance warning of the planned attack and returned the looted items to the Pacaha and issued an apology in order to stave off retribution. De Soto arranged a dinner for the two leaders and arranged a peace treaty between the tribes.

The Hernando de Soto expedition records are the only historical records of Chief Casqui and his tribe. Their later history is uncertain.

In recent years a Spanish trade bead which matches descriptions of the seven-layer glass beads carried by the expedition has been found at the Parkin site as well as two Spanish falconer&#x27;s bells, and Spanish musket balls.

<doc id="344618" wikidata="Q320644" url="?curid=344618" title="China National Space Administration">
<text>The China National Space Administration (CNSA) is a government agency of the People&#x27;s Republic of China headquartered in Haidian, Beijing, responsible for civil space administration and international space cooperation. These responsibilities include organizing or leading foreign exchanges and cooperation in the aerospace field. The CNSA is an administrative agency under the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense.

Founded in 1993, CNSA has pioneered a number of achievements in space for China despite its relatively short history, including becoming the first space agency to land on the far side of the Moon with Chang&#x27;e 4, bringing material back from the Moon with Chang&#x27;e 5 and 6, and being the second agency who successfully landed a rover on Mars with Tianwen-1.

As the governing body of civil space activities, China National Space Administration does not execute any space program. The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation executes China&#x27;s state space programs instead. The China Manned Space Program is operated by China Manned Space Agency, instead of the CNSA.

== History ==
CNSA is an agency created in 1993 when the Ministry of Aerospace Industry was split into CNSA and the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). The former was to be responsible for policy, while the latter was to be responsible for execution. This arrangement proved somewhat unsatisfactory, as these two agencies were, in effect, one large agency, sharing both personnel and management.

As part of a massive restructuring in 1998, CASC was split into a number of smaller state-owned companies. The intention appeared to have been to create a system similar to that characteristic of Western defense procurement in which entities which are government agencies, setting operational policy, would then contract out their operational requirements to entities which were government-owned, but not government-managed.

Since the passage of the Wolf Amendment in 2011, NASA has been forced by Congress to implement a long-standing exclusion policy with CNSA ever since, though this has been periodically overcome. 

In 2021, China began building the Tiangong space station, which consists of three modules designated for crew, cargo, and research. The construction was completed in late 2022, and there are plans to add an additional three modules. 

In 2024, China announced that it will undertake 100 space missions, a significant increase from the 70 missions conducted in 2023 this is mostly satellites, testing, crew replacement, cargo, and more.

== Function ==
CNSA was established as a government institution to develop and fulfill China&#x27;s due international obligations, with the approval by the 8th National People&#x27;s Congress of China (NPC). The 9th NPC assigned CNSA as an internal structure of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND).
CNSA assumes the following main responsibilities: signing governmental agreements in the space area on behalf of organizations, inter-governmental scientific and technical exchanges; and also being in charge of the enforcement of national space policies and managing the national space science, technology and industry.

China has signed governmental space cooperation agreements with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, France, Germany, India, Italy, Pakistan, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States, and some other countries. Significant achievements have been scored in the bilateral and multilateral and technology exchanges and cooperation.

== Administrators ==
The most recent administrator is Zhang Kejian. Wu Yanhua is vice-administrator and Tian Yulong is secretary general.
* April 1993: Liu Jiyuan
* April 1998: Luan Enjie
* 2004: Sun Laiyan
* July 2010: Chen Qiufa
* March 2013: Ma Xingrui
* December 2013: Xu Dazhe
* May 2017: Tang Dengjie
* May 2018: Zhang Kejian

== Departments ==
There are four departments under the CNSA:
* Department of General Planning
* Department of System Engineering
* Department of Science, Technology and Quality Control
* Department of Foreign Affairs

CNSA&#x27;s logo is a similar design to that of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. The arrow in the middle is similar to the Chinese character 人 which means &#x27;human&#x27; or &#x27;people&#x27;, to state that humans are the center of all space exploration. The three concentric ellipses stand for three types of escape velocity (minimum speed needed to reach sustainable orbits, to escape the Earth system, and to escape the Solar System) which are milestones of space exploration. The second ring is drawn with a bold line, to state that China has passed the first stage of exploration (Earth system) and is undergoing the second stage exploration (within the Solar System). The 人 character stands above the three rings to emphasize humanity&#x27;s capability to escape and explore. Olive branches were added to state that China&#x27;s space exploration is peaceful in nature.

<doc id="344623" wikidata="Q110257507" url="?curid=344623" title="Sardinian warbler">
<text>The Sardinian warbler (Curruca melanocephala) is a common and widespread typical warbler from the Mediterranean region. Like most &quot;Curruca&quot; species, it has distinct male and female plumages. The adult male has a grey back, whitish underparts, black head, white throat and red eyes. Plumages are somewhat variable even in the same locality, with the intensity of a reddish hue on upper- and/or underside that varies from absent to (in some subspecies) pronounced. The female is mainly brown above and buff below, with a grey head. The Sardinian warbler&#x27;s song is fast and rattling, and is very characteristic of the Mediterranean areas where this bird breeds.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Sardinian warbler was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the wagtails in the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Motacilla melanocephala&quot;. Gmelin based his entry on a description by the Italian zoologist Francesco Cetti in his book &quot;Gli uccelli di Sardegna&quot; (&quot;The Birds of Sardinia&quot;) that was published in 1776. This was the second volume of his &quot;Storia naturale di Sardegna&quot;. Cetti did not use scientific names for the species. When a translation of Cetti&#x27;s three volumes were published in German, the translator, David Piesch, and the editor, Nathanael Gottfried Leske, included an Appendix at the end of the third volume (published in 1784) in which they proposed the binomial name &quot;Motacilla melanocephala&quot;, the identical name that was later adopted by Gmelin. In spite of this earlier publication, as of 2023 Gmelin is treated as the authority for the species.

The species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Sylvia&quot; that was introduced in 1769 by the Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli. The genus name is from Modern Latin &quot;silvia&quot;, a woodland sprite, related to &quot;silva&quot;, a wood. The specific &quot;melanocephala&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;melas&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, and &quot;kephale&quot;, &quot;head&quot;. Currently, the Sardinian warbler is placed in the genus &quot;Curruca&quot; by the IOC, along with most of the species formerly classified in the genus &quot;Sylvia&quot;.

Together with Menetries&#x27;s warbler the Sardinian warbler forms a superspecies. Both have white malar areas and light throats, and otherwise black heads in adult males, as well as a naked ring around the eye. The eastern subalpine warbler, which seems the superspecies&#x27; closest relative, has a dark throat and breast and a dark gray upper head in males, but otherwise shares these characters. These three species are related to a dark-throated superspecies consisting of Rüppell&#x27;s warbler and the Cyprus warbler, which also share the white malar area with blackish above.

This bird may be considered a superspecies, divided into the western &quot;Curruca melanocephala&quot; and &quot;Curruca momus&quot; from the more arid regions of the Near East and adjacent Africa.

===Subspecies===
The geographical variation in the Sardinian warbler conforms to some extent with Gloger&#x27;s rule, though not as strongly as in some other typical warblers. The validity of &quot;leucogastra&quot; and &quot;norissae&quot; is not accepted by some authors, and &quot;valverdei&quot; has been described very recently. On the other hand, &quot;leucogastra&quot; might be more than one subspecies.

* &quot;Curruca melanocephala melanocephala&quot; 
:Iberia across the northern Mediterranean to western Turkey. Extends into the Maghreb from Iberia, and into Libya from Italy via Sicily. Migrates to the Sahel and oases in the Sahara in winter.
:Large, long wings, tail tip rather pointed. A dark form, usually lacking any reddish in males but flanks extensively grey. Females&#x27; uppersides vary between deep olive brown and greyish olive.
* &quot;Curruca melanocephala leucogastra&quot; - often included in &quot;melanocephala&quot;; phylogenetic status requires review
:Canary Islands, resident, probably some vagrancy between eastern islands and Maghreb.
:Medium size, short-winged and large-billed. Tenerife and La Palma (western) birds are most distinct, being dark above with some rusty/beige hue on the underside in males. Eastern birds (Fuerteventura, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria) are more like &quot;melanocephala&quot; and &quot;momus&quot; but differ in measurements.
* &quot;Curruca melanocephala momus&quot; 
:Near East. Resident, some local movements.
:Smallish, short-winged. Varies between brownish grey and rusty above; underside almost always has reddish hue. Females rusty to rusty olive.
* &quot;Curruca melanocephala norissae&quot; : Fayyum warbler - probably only a local morph of &quot;momus&quot;
:Nile Delta region. Extinct since around 1940.
:Like &quot;momus&quot;, but tend to be very reddish.
* &quot;Curruca melanocephala valverdei&quot; - recently split from &quot;melanocephala&quot;
:From Tiznit (Morocco) south to the Tropic of Cancer, inland to the edge of the Sahara. Resident, but some seasonal movements.
:Medium-sized, tail tip quite square. A very pure-colored form, the palest subspecies. Undersides clean white. Matte black cap in males. Juveniles decidedly sandy.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds in the southernmost areas of Europe and just into Asia in Turkey and the eastern end of the Mediterranean. This small passerine bird, unlike most &quot;warblers&quot;, is not particularly migratory, but some birds winter in North Africa, and it occurs as a vagrant well away from the breeding range, as far as Great Britain.

==Behaviour and ecology==
This is a bird of open country and cultivation, with bushes for nesting. The nest is built in low shrub or brambles, and 3-6 eggs are laid. Like most &quot;warblers&quot;, it is insectivorous, but will also take berries and other soft fruit.

<text>The Caño Limón – Coveñas pipeline is a crude oil pipeline in Colombia from the Caño Limón oilfield in the municipalities of Arauca and Arauquita in Arauca Department on the border of Venezuela to Coveñas on Colombia&#x27;s Caribbean coastline. It is jointly owned by the state oil firm Ecopetrol, and U.S. company Occidental Petroleum. The pipeline is long.

==History==

The pipeline was opened in 1986. During its existence, the pipeline has often been attacked by guerrilla organizations that oppose the Colombian government. The National Liberation Army (ELN), which has traditionally been involved in such attacks, charged in a communique that &quot;in our country, energy policy does not prioritize investment (in Colombia) but rather exploitation and consumption that sacrifices future generations.&quot; Together with the FARC, they have repeatedly sabotaged and exploded sections of the pipeline.

The Colombian government has militarized the area in response. For several years a security tax was imposed on oil producers in the region, which have also been targeted by guerrilla extortion and kidnappings. Occidental Petroleum also contracted the security firm AirScan to aid the Colombian military in the defense of its operations.

In 2001, there were 170 attacks on the pipeline. The pipeline was out of operation for 266 days of that year. The government estimates that these bombings potentially reduced the GDP of Colombia by 0.5%. Occidental Petroleum lobbied and testified for increased American involvement in protecting the pipeline. The government of the United States increased military aid by $98 million, in 2003, to Colombia to assist in the effort to defend the pipeline. Attacks on the pipeline have subsequently been reduced during the following years.

In 1998, AirScan misidentified the village of Santo Domingo as a hostile guerrilla target, leading to a December 18 cluster bomb attack by the Colombian military which killed eighteen civilians, including nine children. The incident led to different legal actions against all the parties involved, some of which are still in progress.

<text>The tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) is a migratory bird of the family Hirundinidae. Found in the Americas, the tree swallow was first described in 1807 by French ornithologist Louis Vieillot as &quot;Hirundo bicolor&quot;. It has since been moved to its current genus, &quot;Tachycineta&quot;, within which its phylogenetic placement is debated. The tree swallow has glossy blue-green , with the exception of the blackish wings and tail, and white . The bill is black, the eyes dark brown, and the legs and feet pale brown. The female is generally duller than the male, and the first-year female has mostly brown upperparts, with some blue feathers. Juveniles have brown upperparts, and gray-brown-washed breasts. The tree swallow breeds in the US and Canada. It winters along southern US coasts south, along the Gulf Coast, to Panama and the northwestern coast of South America, and in the West Indies.

The tree swallow nests either in isolated pairs or loose groups, in both natural and artificial cavities. Breeding can start as soon as early May, although this date is occurring earlier because of climate change, and it can end as late as July. This bird is generally socially monogamous (although about 8% of males are polygynous), with high levels of extra-pair paternity. This can benefit the male, but since the female controls copulation, the lack of resolution on how this behavior benefits females makes the high level of extra-pair paternity puzzling. The female incubates the clutch of two to eight (but usually four to seven) pure white eggs for around 14 to 15 days. The chicks hatch slightly asynchronously, allowing the female to prioritize which chicks to feed in times of food shortage. They generally fledge about 18 to 22 days after hatching. The tree swallow is sometimes considered a model organism, due to the large amount of research done on it.

An aerial , the tree swallow forages both alone and in groups, eating mostly insects, in addition to mollusks, spiders, and fruit. The nestlings, like the adult, primarily eat insects, fed to it by both sexes. This swallow is vulnerable to parasites, but, when on nestlings, these do little damage. The effect of disease can become stronger as a tree swallow gets older, as some parts of the immune system decline with age. Acquired T cell-mediated immunity, for example, decreases with age, whereas both innate and acquired humoral immunity do not. Because of its large range and stable population, the tree swallow is considered to be least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In the US, it is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, and in Canada by the Migratory Birds Convention Act. This swallow is negatively affected by human activities, such as the clearing of forests; acidified lakes can force a breeding tree swallow to go long distances to find calcium-rich food items to feed to its chicks.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The tree swallow was described as &quot;Hirundo bicolor&quot; by Louis Pierre Vieillot in his &quot;Histoire naturelle des oiseaux de l&#x27;Amérique Septentrionale&quot;, published in 1807. It was then placed in its current genus &quot;Tachycineta&quot; when Jean Cabanis established it in 1850. In 1878, Elliott Coues suggested that the tree swallow, at the very least, be put in its own subgenus, &quot;Iridoprocne&quot;, on the basis of its plumage, along with the white-winged swallow, Chilean swallow, white-rumped swallow, and mangrove swallow. By 1882, he had upgraded this to a full genus. Some authors continued to use this classification, with the addition of Tumbes swallow; however, genetic evidence supports the existence of a single genus, &quot;Tachycineta&quot;. The tree swallow is also called the white-bellied swallow for its white underparts.

The generally accepted genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;takhykinetos&quot;, &quot;moving quickly&quot;, and the specific &quot;bicolor&quot; is Latin and means &quot;two-coloured&quot;. The other genus name, &quot;Iridoprocne&quot;, comes from the Greek &quot;iris&quot;, meaning rainbow, and Procne, a figure who supposedly turned into a swallow.

How exactly the tree swallow is related to other members of &quot;Tachycineta&quot; is unresolved. In studies based on mitochondrial DNA, it was placed basal (meaning it was the first offshoot in the species tree) within the North American-Caribbean clade consisting of the violet-green swallow, golden swallow, and Bahama swallow. Although mitochondrial DNA is advocated as a better indicator of evolutionary changes because it evolves quickly, analyses based on it can suffer because it is only inherited from the mother, making it worse than nuclear DNA from multiple loci at representing the phylogeny of a whole group. A study based on such nuclear DNA placed the tree swallow in the most basal position within &quot;Tachycineta&quot; as a whole (as a sister group to the rest of the genus).

==Description==
The tree swallow has a length between about and a weight of approximately . Wingspan ranges from . The male has mostly glossy blue-green , the wings and tail being blackish. The and the cheek patch are white, although the coverts are gray-brown. The bill is black, the eyes dark brown, and the legs and feet pale brown. The female is duller in color than the male, and sometimes has a brown forehead. The second-year female also has brown upperparts, with a variable number of blue feathers; some third-year females also retain a portion of this subadult plumage. According to a 1987 study, this likely allows a younger female to explore nest sites, as the resident male is usually less aggressive to a subadult female. A 2013 study found that the resident female was less aggressive towards second-year female models when they were presented separately from older models. Why the female eventually replaces its subadult plumage is unknown; it may allow males to assess female quality, as pairs mate assortatively based on plumage brightness. The juvenile tree swallow can be distinguished by its brown upperparts and gray-brown-washed breast.

===Voice===
The tree swallow&#x27;s song consists of three parts: the chirp, the whine, and the gurgle. These sections may be repeated or omitted, and all can stand alone. The first, as the chirp call (sometimes divided into the contact call and solicitation call), is made by the female during copulation and in both sexes to stimulate the nestlings to beg or (in some populations) when their mate leaves or enters the nest cavity. The whine, generally consisting of a downward shift in frequency followed by an upward shift, may be given alone as the anxiety call, occasionally made in response to certain predators. The gurgle, as when it appears at the end of the song, is usually uttered twice. It is likely involved in pair bonding. The chatter call is used to advertise nest sites (the reason it is also known as the &quot;nest-site advertising call&quot;) and is also given to intruding conspecifics. A short high-pitched submission call is sometimes uttered after an aggressive encounter with another tree swallow. While being physically restrained or in pain, a distress call may be given. The male often utters a ticking (or rasping) aggression call during copulation, and both sexes use it at the end of mobbing dives. The alarm call is given in reaction to predators and other intruders, and can serve to induce older nestlings to crouch and stop begging when a predator is near.

Communication between parents and offspring can be disrupted by human-generated noise. A 2014 study, for example, found that broods for whom white noise was played were less likely to crouch or stop begging in response to alarm calls. Parents did not alter their calls to compensate, likely increasing predation risk. Noise can also disrupt whether parents respond to begging, but this may be balanced out by the louder calls nestlings give when exposed to it. Increased begging effort, however, may be ineffective or costly for louder levels of noise.

==Distribution and habitat==
The tree swallow breeds in North America. Its range extends to north-central Alaska and up to the tree line in Canada. It is found as far south as Tennessee in the eastern part of its range, California and New Mexico in the west, and Kansas in the center. It occasionally breeds further south in the US, and vagrants are sometimes found in the Arctic Circle, the northern Pacific, Greenland, and Europe. The wintering range is from California and southwestern Arizona in the west and southeastern Virginia in the east south along the Gulf Coast to the West Indies, Panama, and the northwestern South American coast. While migrating, this swallow often uses stop-over sites, spending an average of 57 days at these areas during autumn. To get to its wintering range, it often uses one of three flyways: the Western flyway, west of the Rocky Mountains; the Central flyway, between the Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes, stretching south into Eastern Mexico; and the Eastern flyway, from the Great Lakes east. When a swallow returns to nest, it usually does not change breeding sites.

The breeding habitat of this bird is primarily in open and wooded areas, especially those near water. It roosts every night during the non-breeding season, preferring to rest in cane or reed beds over water, but it is also found over land and on trees and wires. Roosting sites are generally apart.

==Behaviour==

Because of the large amount of research on the tree swallow and how it willingly breeds in nest boxes, biologist Jason Jones recommended that it be considered a model organism. Although it is aggressive during the breeding season, this swallow is sociable outside of it, forming flocks sometimes numbering thousands of birds.

===Breeding===

The tree swallow nests in structures with pre-existing holes, both natural and artificial. These were once found only in forested regions, but the building of nest boxes has allowed this bird to expand into open habitats. This swallow usually nests in the area it bred the year before; only about 14% of females and 4% of males disperse to breed at a new site per year. Most do not go far, usually breeding at sites less than away from their original grounds. Dispersal is influenced by breeding success; of the adult females that fail to fledge a chick, about 28% disperse, compared to 5% of successful breeders. Natal dispersal (when a bird does not return to the site it was born at to breed) is common in the tree swallow and occurs more frequently than breeding dispersal. It nests both in loose groups and isolated pairs. When nesting in loose groups, nests are usually spaced at least apart, and those that are closer in distance are usually further apart in terms of laying date. In natural cavities, the tree swallow nests about apart from its neighbor. The nest hole in these situations is, on average, above ground level, although about 45% of them are less than above the ground. Higher cavities are likely favored because they reduce predation, while lower nest holes may be chosen to avoid competition. Entrance widths are often between , whereas entrance heights are more variable: a 1989 study found openings ranging from . Cavity volume is generally below . After finding a suitable place to nest, the male perches near it and calls frequently. A lack of sites can cause fights between birds, sometimes resulting in deaths. This swallow usually defends an area around the nest with a radius of about , as well as extra nests inside of that , by blocking the entrance to the nest and chasing intruders. The nest cup itself is made from grass, moss, pine needles, and aquatic plants collected mostly by the female, and is lined with feathers gathered primarily by the male in fights. The feathers may function to insulate the nest, decreasing incubation time and likely preventing hypothermia in chicks. In addition to faster growth for chicks, eggs cool slower in nests with feathers than those without. However, a study published in 2018 did not find a significant correlation between the number of feathers in nests that were artificially warmed versus those that were not. Additionally, it found that nests in St. Denis, Saskatchewan used significantly less feathers than those in Annapolis Valley, despite the former being further north. However, temperatures in Nova Scotia (where Annapolis Valley is) are generally lower than those in Saskatchewan, possibly explaining the unexpected result.
During courtship, a male tree swallow attacks an unknown female. This can be stimulated through wing-fluttering flight by the female, which may be an invitation to court. The male may then take a vertical posture, with a raised and slightly spread tail and wings flicked and slightly drooped. This prompts the female to try to land on the male&#x27;s back, but he flies to prevent this; this is repeated. After courting the female, the male flies to his chosen nest site, which the female inspects. During copulation, the male hovers over the female, and then mounts her, giving ticking calls. He then makes with the female while holding her neck feathers in his bill and standing on her slightly outstretched wings. Copulation occurs multiple times.

Eggs are laid from early May to mid-June (although this is happening earlier due to climate change) and chicks fledge between mid-June and July. Latitude is positively correlated with laying date, while female age and wing length (longer wings allow more efficient foraging) are negatively correlated. The tree swallow is likely an income breeder, as it breeds based on food abundance and temperatures during the laying season. This species is generally socially monogamous, but up to 8% of breeding males are polygynous. Polygyny is influenced by territory: males having territories with nest boxes at least apart are more likely to be polygynous. It is suggested that this polygyny depends on the conditions during the laying season: better conditions, such as an abundance of food, allow females in polygyny who do not receive help foraging to lay more eggs.
The tree swallow has high rates of extra-pair paternity, 38% to 69% of nestlings being a product of extra-pair paternity, and 50% to 87% of broods containing at least one nestling that was the result of an extra-pair copulation. One factor that might contribute to this is that females have control over copulation, making paternity guards ineffective. This may be mitigated by more frequent copulations just before egg laying, according to a 2009 study which found that within-pair copulation attempts peaked three to one days before the first egg was laid and that more successful attempts during this period increased the share of within-pair young males had. This latter finding contradicts those of a 1993 and a 1994 study. Extra-pair paternity does not change the level of parental care the male contributes in the tree swallow. A significant number of extra-pair fathers may be floaters (those present at breeding grounds that presumably do not breed). A 2001 study found that out of 35 extra-pair nestlings, 25 were sired by local residents, three by residents of nearby sites, and seven by male floaters. In the tree swallow, floating thus helps males in good condition produce more chicks, while allowing males in bad condition to be successful by investing in parental care. There is also a significant population of female floaters; a 1985 study estimated that around 23% to 27% of females were floaters, of which about 47% to 79% were subadults.

Why females engage in extra-pair copulation and how they choose extra-pair mates is controversial. One theory, called the genetic compatibility hypothesis, states that increased offspring fitness results from increased heterozygosity, and thus that female tree swallows would prefer to mate with males that are less genetically similar to them. Females may also choose sperm after copulation to ensure a compatible mate. In support of this theory, a 2007 study found that extra-pair offspring were more heterozygous than within-pair offspring. However, a 2005 paper discovered a slight negative correlation between a pair&#x27;s genetic similarity and the proportion of extra-pair young in their nest. The good genes theory says that females choose extra-pair males based on the quality of their genes. This would explain why some tree swallows do not have any extra-pair young, whereas others do. However, most studies have not found phenotypic differences between extra-pair and within-pair males (although a 2007 study did find that older males with brighter plumage were more likely to mate outside of the pair bond). Additionally, according to a 2017 thesis, extra-pair offspring are no more likely to join their natal population than within-pair offspring. Another theory suggests that extra-pair paternity is context dependent, with extra-pair young outperforming within-pair young in certain situations, and underperforming in other environments. A 2017 dissertation, for example, found that extra-pair young were larger, heavier, and longer-winged than within-pair young when both were exposed to predator mounts, while within-pair young were heavier than extra-pair young when they were shown non-predator mounts. This thesis also found that within-pair young outperformed extra-pair young in terms of life-time fitness when they were raised in less-variable environments, suggesting that extra-pair offspring have less developmental plasticity than within-pair offspring. A 2018 study weakly supported this context dependent hypothesis, finding that extra-pair offspring were more likely to fledge than within-pair offspring in experimentally enlarged broods; however, neither telomere length (a correlate of survival and reproductive success) nor size 12 days after hatching were significantly different among these young, and no significant differences between the two types were found in non-enlarged broods.

Studies attempting to prove the adaptability of extra-pair paternity for females have been criticized for the lack of positive effect that increased offspring fitness would have when compared with the potential cost of decreased fitness for the female, such as increased predation from searching for mates. Thus, theories based on the non-adaptivity of extra-pair paternity for females have been postulated. These theories are based on genetic constraint, where an allele resulting in a maladaptive behavior is maintained because it also contributes to a beneficial phenotype. The theory of intersexual antagonistic pleiotropy says that strong selection for extra-pair paternity in males (as seen in this bird) overrides the weak selection against extra-pair paternity in females. The hypothesis of intrasexual antagonistic pleiotropy, meanwhile, argues that extra-pair paternity is present because the genes regulating it have pleiotropic effects on aspects of female fitness, like within-pair copulation rate.
The tree swallow lays a clutch of two to eight, although usually four to seven, pure white, and translucent at laying, eggs that measure about . These eggs are incubated by the female, usually after the second-to-last egg is laid, for 11 to 20 days, although most hatch after 14 to 15 days. About 88% of nests produce at least one nestling, but this can be lowered by poor weather and a younger breeding female. The eggs generally hatch in the order they were laid. They also hatch slightly asynchronously, with an average of 28 hours between when the first and final nestling emerges. This can result in a weight hierarchy where earlier-hatched chicks weigh more (especially early in the nestling period) than those hatched later, allowing the female to prioritize which chick to give food to during food shortages. This likely has its greatest effect early in the nestling period, as by 12 days after hatching, there are generally no significant weight differences. Infanticide of the chicks and eggs sometimes occurs when a male is replaced by another male. Infanticide usually does not occur when the clutch is not complete, as replacement males then have a chance to fertilize at least one egg. When the male arrives during incubation, it sometimes commits infanticide, but other times adopts the eggs, as there is a chance that some eggs were sired from the replacement male. If the replacement male arrives after the chicks hatch, infanticide is usually committed, though the female will sometimes prevent this.

Nests produced by females of better condition often have sex ratios skewed towards high quality males. A 2000 study hypothesized this to be because males have more variable reproductive success, and therefore that a high quality male produces more offspring than a female of similar quality.

The growth and survival of nestling tree swallows is influenced by their environment. In both younger and older nestlings (those between two and four days old and between nine and eleven days, respectively) growth is positively influenced by a higher maximum temperature, particularly in the former. A later hatching date negatively impacts growth, especially for younger nestlings. Older chicks grow somewhat faster when insects are abundant. Growth in younger nestlings increases with age, while in old nestlings, it decreases as they get older. Young tree swallows are able to thermoregulate at least 75% as effectively as the adult at an average age of 9.5 days when out of the nest, and from four to eight days old when in the nest (depending on the size of the brood). The nestlings fledge after about 18 to 22 days, with about 80% fledging success. Like hatching success, this is negatively affected by unfavourable weather and a younger female. Chicks may be preyed on by snakes and raccoons. This predation can be exacerbated by begging calls.

===Feeding===

The tree swallow forages up to above the ground singly or in groups. Its flight is a mix of flapping and gliding. During the breeding season, this is mostly within of the nest site. When it is foraging for nestlings, though, it usually goes up to from the nest, mostly staying in sight of it, and forages at a height up to . As well as being caught in flight, insects are sometimes taken from the ground, water, vegetation, and vertical surfaces.

The tree swallow eats mostly insects, with some mollusks, spiders, and fruit. In North America, flies make up about 40% of the diet, supplemented with beetles and ants. Otherwise, the diet is about 90% flies. The insects taken are a mix of aquatic and terrestrial organisms; the former are an important source of omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids. This is because, although the tree swallow can convert the precursor α-Linolenic acid into highly unsaturated fatty acids like docosahexaenoic acid, it cannot do so in the quantities needed. The seed and berry food is mainly from the genus &quot;Myrica&quot;, which is mainly taken in all four of the Northern Hemisphere seasons except summer. Crustaceans were also found to be important in the wintering diet in a study on Long Island, New York.

Both sexes feed the nestlings (although the male feeds the chicks less than the females) resulting in about 10 to 20 feedings per hour. The parents often use the chirp call to stimulate nestlings to beg. This is used more frequently with younger chicks, as they beg less than older chicks when the parent arrives with food but does not call. The likelihood of begging in the absence of parents also increases with age. The hatching order affects how much a chick is fed; last-hatched nestlings (in cases where hatching is asynchronous) are likely fed less than those hatched earlier. Nestlings closer to the entrance of the nest are also more likely to be fed, as are those who beg first and more frequently. The overall rate at which a brood is fed also increases with more begging. The diet itself is composed mostly of insects, those in the orders Diptera, Hemiptera, and Odonata making up most of the diet. These insects are mostly up to in size, but sometimes are up to in length. In nests near lakes acidified by humans, calcium supplements, primarily fish bones, crayfish exoskeletons, clam shells, and the shells of bird eggs, are harder to find. This forces the adult tree swallow to travel further than usual—sometimes up to away from the nest—to get these calcium supplements.

==Survival==
The tree swallow has an average lifespan of 2.7 years and a maximum of 12 years. About 79% of individuals do not survive their first year, and those that do face an annual mortality rate of 40% to 60%. Most deaths are likely the result of cold weather, which reduces insect availability, leading to starvation. Lifespan is associated with telomere length: a 2005 study that used return rates (to the breeding site of the previous year) as a proxy for survival found that those with the longest telomeres at one year of age had a predicted lifespan of 3.5 years, compared to the 1.2 years for those with the shortest telomeres. Whether short telomeres cause a reduction in fitness or are simply an indicator of it is unknown. Regardless, a 2016 thesis found that measures of condition were positively correlated with telomere length. Males also generally had longer telomeres than females, as did smaller-winged birds. Individuals with shorter telomeres may compensate for potential losses in fitness by increasing reproductive effort, whereas those with longer telomeres may decrease their investment, as evidenced by the smaller proportion of chicks females with longer telomeres fledged. Telomere length is highly heritable, and is especially dependent on that of the mother.

===Predation===
The tree swallow is susceptible to a wide range of predators. Eggs, nestlings, and adults in the nest fall victim to black rat snakes, American crows, American kestrels, common grackles, northern flickers, chipmunks, deermice, domestic cats, weasels, American black bears, and raccoons. While flying or perched, predators to the tree swallow include American kestrels, black-billed magpies, barred owls, great horned owls, merlins, peregrine falcons, and sharp-shinned hawks. While evasive flight is the usual response to predators in free-flying swallows, mobbing behavior is common around the nest, and is directed not just towards predators, but also towards nest site competitors, who might be scared off by it. This behavior involves the swallow swarming and diving towards (but not actually striking) the intruder from around above the ground, usually giving soft ticking calls near the end and coming within about of the predator. It seems to alter the intensity of its attacks based on which predator approaches; a 1992 study found that ferrets elicited a more vigorous defense than black rat snakes, and a 2019 thesis similarly discovered that black rat snake models were dived at the least and eastern chipmunk models the most. It is suggested that the snake prompted a weaker response because defense behaviors may be less effective and more dangerous to perform against it.

===Parasites===

The tree swallow is vulnerable to various parasites, such as the blood parasite &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;. It is also susceptible to the flea &quot;Ceratophyllus idius&quot; and the feather mites &quot;Pteronyssoides tyrrelli&quot;, &quot;Trouessartia&quot;, and (likely) &quot;Hemialges&quot;. It is also probably afflicted by lice of the genera &quot;Brueelia&quot; and &quot;Myrsidea&quot;. There is a correlation between the number of fleas on a bird and the number of young it is caring for. This relationship is speculated to arise from an improved microclimate for fleas due to a larger clutch. Nestlings also suffer from parasites, like blow-flies of the genus &quot;Protocalliphora&quot;, which results in a loss of blood by nestlings. These parasites, though, are found in a majority of nests and do not seem to have a large effect on nestlings. A study published in 1992 found that the effects of blow-fly parasitism explained only about 5.5% of the variation in nestling mass.

===Immunology===
In the breeding female tree swallow, humoral immunocompetence (HIC) is inversely correlated with laying date. This means that, on average, a bird that lays its eggs earlier has a stronger antibiotic response to an antigen than a bird that lays later. A tree swallow that is handicapped by wing-clipping generally has a lower HIC. These relationships could be interpreted as supporting the conclusion that a female that lays earlier acquires a higher HIC, but the authors of the study that found the correlations believed this unlikely, due to the colder temperatures near the start of the breeding season. Instead, they thought that HIC could be a measure of quality, and that a higher quality female is able to lay earlier. The authors also postulated that it is an indicator of workload, as shown by the lower HIC of handicapped birds.

Higher quality female tree swallows (as measured by laying date) are able to maintain their reproductive effort while diverting resources to fight an immune challenge. Lower quality swallows are less able to do so; a 2005 study in Ithaca, New York, found that late-laying females with an artificially enlarged brood, although able to maintain offspring quality, had lower responses to an immune challenge than those that were of higher quality or did not have an enlarged brood. Whether a female chooses to prioritize offspring quality or immunocompetence is likely related to survival probabilities; a 2005 study discovered that females with an enlarged brood in Alaska, where survival rates are lower, had weaker immune responses, but kept reproductive effort steady, whereas those in Tennessee, with higher survival rates, had a stronger response but lower quality offspring.

In the tree swallow, some components of the immune system deteriorate with age. Acquired T cell-mediated immunity, for example, declines with age in the female tree swallow. But, the age of a female does not affect both the acquired and innate humoral immunity; the lack of deterioration in the former contrasts with studies on barn swallows and female collared flycatchers. Because of this immunosenescence (a decrease in immune function with age), older females infected with a disease generally visit their nest less, resulting in their nestlings growing slower. They are also likely to lose weight because of an infection.

==Status==
The tree swallow is considered to be least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This is due to the bird&#x27;s large range of about , and its stable population, estimated to be about 20,000,000 individuals. It is protected in the US by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, and in Canada by the Migratory Birds Convention Act. In some parts of the US, the range of this swallow has extended south, likely due to changes in land use, the reintroduction of beavers, and nest boxes installed for bluebirds. The tree swallow is negatively impacted by the clearing of forests and the reduction of marshes, the latter reducing the habitat available for wintering. This swallow has to compete for nest sites with the common starling, house sparrow (both introduced to North America), bluebirds, and the house wren (which also destroys nests without occupying them). Acidification of lakes can force this swallow to go relatively long distances to find calcium-rich items, and can result in chicks eating plastic. Other chemicals, like pesticides and other pollutants, can become highly concentrated in eggs, and PCBs are associated with the abandonment of a pair&#x27;s clutch. Contamination from oil sands mine sites can negatively affect tree swallows by increasing the presence of toxins, as measured by the activity of ethoxyresorufin-&quot;o&quot;-deethylase (a detoxification enzyme) in nestlings. This normally has little influence on nestling and fledging, though extreme weather can reveal the effects: a 2006 study found that nestlings from wetlands most polluted by oil sands processing material were more than 10 times more likely to die than those from a control site during periods of synchronized cold temperatures and heavy rainfall, compared to the lack of difference in mortality between the groups when the weather was less extreme. A 2019 paper, however, found that increased precipitation caused a similar decline in hatching and nestling success for nestlings both near and far from oil sands sites. In another study, birds exposed to mercury fledged, on average, one less chick than those not, an effect amplified by warm weather. In addition, cold weather events can rapidly reduce the availability of aerial insect prey, and in some populations with advancing reproduction may result in reduced offspring survival.

He has also won five Grammy awards and 59 Gospel Music Association Dove Awards, more Dove awards than any other artist in history. His seven &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; Dove Awards are also an industry record. As of 2022, Chapman has sold more than 16 million albums and has 10 RIAA-certified Gold or Platinum albums.

On July 27, 2024, he was invited to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry by Ricky Skaggs.

== History ==
Steven Curtis Chapman was born to Judy and Herb Chapman in Paducah, Kentucky, on November 21, 1962. Steven&#x27;s father is a guitar teacher and owns a music store in Paducah; Steven and his older brother Herb Jr. grew up playing the guitar and singing.

After graduating from high school, Chapman enrolled as a pre-med student at Georgetown College in Kentucky. After several semesters he transferred to Anderson College in Anderson west of Muncie, Indiana for a short time but dropped out. He went to Nashville to pursue a career in music. While in Nashville he briefly attended Belmont University. He began working at an Opryland USA music show in East Nashville while being involved in songwriting. In the 1980s, Chapman wrote a song called &quot;Built to Last&quot;, which was recorded by prominent gospel group the Imperials. The success of the song landed him a songwriting deal with Sparrow Records; he rose to prominence there. By 2007, artists like Sandi Patty, Billy Dean, Glen Campbell, the Cathedral Quartet and Roger Whittaker had recorded Chapman&#x27;s songs.

In 1987, Chapman released his first album, &quot;First Hand&quot;. The album included the song &quot;Weak Days&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 on the Contemporary Christian Music chart. In 1988, he followed with his second album, &quot;Real Life Conversations&quot;, earning him four more hits including the No. 1 song &quot;His Eyes&quot;. The song, which was co-written with James Isaac Elliott, earned the Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year award from the Gospel Music Association in 1989. In the same year, he also won a GMA Award for Songwriter of the Year. Next Chapman released more albums including &quot;More to This Life&quot; and &quot;For the Sake of the Call&quot;. These albums featured several No. 1 singles and were awarded several GMA Awards. The latter gave Chapman his first Grammy in the Best Pop Gospel Album category. These achievements strengthened his position in the Christian music scene.

In 1992, Chapman made a successful shift into a more mainstream audience with his album &quot;The Great Adventure&quot;. The album garnered Chapman two more Grammys, for the album and for the title track video, again in gospel categories. After Sparrow Records was purchased by EMI/Liberty, they began to market the album to a broader audience pushing it to gold status in 1993. The success of the album prompted Chapman to record one of his concerts and release it as &quot;The Live Adventure&quot;, both as a video and a CD. This continuation won Chapman more GMA Awards, and also a new award from &quot;American Songwriter&quot; magazine for Songwriter and Artist of the Year.

&quot;Heaven in the Real World&quot;, &quot;Signs of Life&quot;, and &quot;Speechless&quot; continued his success. In 2000, he provided the voice of Baloo in &quot;The Jungle Book Groove Party&quot; and reprised the role 22 years later in &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;. In 2001 with the release of &quot;Declaration&quot;, Chapman got more attention in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. That album along with 2003&#x27;s &quot;All About Love&quot;, peaked in the Top 15. The follow-up, &quot;All Things New&quot;, peaked at No. 22. Chapman has also released four Christmas albums, beginning with 1995&#x27;s &quot;The Music of Christmas&quot;. In 2003 he released &quot;Christmas Is All in the Heart&quot; exclusively through Hallmark Gold Crown Stores and in 2005, he released &quot;All I Really Want for Christmas&quot; and finally &quot;Joy&quot; was released in 2012. Chapman has been a frequent guest performer at Walt Disney World, and has been a guest narrator for Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional, most recently appearing in 2016, 2019, and 2021.

In 2006, Chapman toured several Asian countries. His website said that his concert for U.S. troops serving in South Korea was the first Christian concert ever performed for the troops in that country, and a concert in Shanghai, China, was &quot;the first public performance by a Gospel recording artist event in the city open to China passport holders&quot;, and the third-largest concert in Shanghai that spring. He went to Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Singapore on the tour. During the time, his song &quot;The Blessing&quot; reached No. 1 on Thailand radio charts.

In 2007, Chapman co-headlined NewSong&#x27;s annual Winter Jam tour with Jeremy Camp. For the tour, he brought his sons&#x27; band, Colony House, on tour to play as his backing band, along with longtime keyboardist Scott Sheriff. Chapman also released &quot;This Moment&quot;, which included the hit singles &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Yours&quot;, in October 2007. &quot;Cinderella&quot; was chosen for &quot;WOW Hits 2009&quot;. On April 20, 2008, Chapman was awarded a star on Nashville&#x27;s Walk of Fame for his contributions in Christian music. On November 3, 2009, Chapman released his seventeenth album &quot;Beauty Will Rise&quot;. Many of the songs from this album are inspired by the death of his daughter, Maria Sue. He claims that the songs on the album are his &quot;personal psalms&quot;. Chapman, his wife, and two sons have a tattoo of the flower that Maria drew before her untimely death.

In August 2012, Chapman announced his departure from Sparrow Records and that he had signed with Sony Music&#x27;s Provident Label Group. He released his fourth Christmas album, &quot;JOY&quot;, on October 16, 2012. &quot;Deep Roots&quot; was released exclusively through Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. on March 11, 2013. In September 2013, Reunion Records released Chapman&#x27;s eighteenth album (the second with Reunion Records), &quot;The Glorious Unfolding&quot;, which is also his first studio album in seven years that features completely original material. The album received critical acclaim, with many critics ranking it among his other chart-topping albums. The album peaked at No. 27 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

From September 2014 until September 2017, Chapman hosted the Sam&#x27;s Place: Music for the Spirit concert series at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville and featured performances including MercyMe, Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, and Third Day. In 2015, Chapman released &quot;Warrior&quot; as the official song for the soundtrack to &quot;War Room&quot;. &quot;Amen&quot;, was sent to Christian AC radio on October 6, 2015. In 2019, Chapman released the sequel to his &quot;Billboard&quot; Bluegrass #1 Album &quot;Deep Roots&quot; entitled &quot;Deeper Roots: Where the Bluegrass Grows,&quot; which also peaked #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bluegrass charts.

On July 27, 2024, Chapman was invited to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry by Ricky Skaggs. He was inducted November 1, 2024. His father and brother joined him on stage to sing a song together and fulfilled his father’s lifelong dream of singing at the Grand Ole Opry.

==Personal life==
Chapman is a devout Christian and is married to Mary Beth Chapman (née Chapman). They met in the early 1980s at Anderson University in Anderson, Indiana, and married in the fall of 1984. The couple live in Franklin, Tennessee and have three biological children: Emily Elizabeth, Caleb Stevenson, and Will Franklin. They adopted three daughters from China; Shaohannah Hope Yan, Stevey Joy Ru, and Maria Sue Chunxi.

Chapman and his wife together have written three children&#x27;s books with adoption themes: &quot;Shaoey And Dot: Bug Meets Bundle&quot; (2004), &quot;Shaoey and Dot: The Christmas Miracle&quot; (2005), and &quot;Shaoey and Dot: A Thunder and Lightning Bug Story&quot; with illustrations by Jim Chapman (2006). Chapman&#x27;s modern fairytale, &quot;Cinderella: The Love of a Daddy and His Princess&quot; (2008) chronicles and celebrates the blessings of childhood, family, love, and life. Together with minister Scotty Smith, Chapman has authored two books for the adult inspirational market: &quot;Speechless&quot; (1999), and &quot;Restoring Broken Things&quot; (2005). Chapman&#x27;s song &quot;All About Love&quot; has been featured in commercials for the Fox television show &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot;. In 2016, he released the memoir &quot;Between Heaven and the Real World: My Story&quot;.

Chapman and his sons recorded a cover of the song &quot;I Love My Lips&quot; under the name of &quot;Stevenson&quot; after his oldest son Caleb Stevenson for the 2003 &quot;Veggie Rocks&quot; album. His sons Caleb and Will perform together as the band Colony House. Chapman is best friends with Geoff Moore. On November 10, 2011, Chapman and his wife became grandparents for the first time when a baby girl, Eiley Eliza Richards, was born to Emily and her husband Tanner Richards in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
Chapman&#x27;s brother-in-law, Jim Chapman, is the bass vocalist in the 1990s country music group 4 Runner and his father, Herb is also in the group. Steven&#x27;s son, Will Chapman, married singer/songwriter Jillian Edwards from Richardson, Texas which is next to Dallas, in December 2012.

===Death of Maria Sue Chunxi Chapman===
Maria Sue Chunxi Chapman died from her injuries and blood loss in a driveway accident on May 21, 2008. The accident happened eight days after Maria&#x27;s 5th birthday. Will Franklin was pulling into the driveway of their house after he auditioned for a musical at school and Maria Sue was running to meet him so she could ask Will to put her on the monkey bars. They didn&#x27;t see each other in time and Will accidentally ran over Maria. Steven&#x27;s family did CPR on Maria while they were waiting for the paramedics to arrive. They were unable to revive her. Maria was life-flighted via air medical services to Vanderbilt Children&#x27;s Hospital. The paramedics tried but failed to save Maria on the way to the hospital. Maria was pronounced dead on arrival. At the time of Maria&#x27;s death, the Chapman family was preparing to celebrate Caleb&#x27;s high school graduation from Christ Presbyterian Academy and Emily&#x27;s engagement just hours before the accident.

During the memorial service for Maria, the family expressed their faith in God and their love for one another. After Maria&#x27;s accident, the Chapman family spoke publicly about their loss and the role which faith played in their healing. They have appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, in &quot;People&quot;, &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, and &quot;Huckabee&quot;. Maria was buried in the flower girl dress that she was planning to wear to Emily&#x27;s October wedding. The family put Maria&#x27;s ballet shoes, her favorite doll, letters from her brothers and sisters, and other personal mementos to Maria in her coffin. During the funeral service, Will kept Maria&#x27;s security blanket around his shoulders. Maria Sue is buried in Williamson Memorial Gardens in Franklin, Tennessee. Chapman&#x27;s next album, &quot;Beauty Will Rise&quot;, is about Maria&#x27;s death and its aftermath. Steven nearly quit his singing career due to Maria&#x27;s death and he nearly chose to never sing &quot;Cinderella” again, but soon realized that Maria would have wanted him to continue singing and to honor her memory by singing &quot;Cinderella”. An investigation of Maria&#x27;s death was performed by the Tennessee Highway Patrol. It was ruled as an accident and no charges were filed. In November 2009, a year after Maria died, Steven performed at a special concert at Harvest Christian Fellowship. Greg Laurie, the pastor of Harvest, suffered the loss of his own son, Christopher Laurie, just months after Steven&#x27;s loss. Steven performed several songs from &quot;Beauty Will Rise&quot;.

Since Maria&#x27;s unexpected death, Mary Beth Chapman has written and released a book about the death of her daughter called &quot;Choosing to SEE: A Journey of Struggle and Hope&quot;. Steven and Mary Beth later honored Maria&#x27;s memory by starting Maria&#x27;s Big House of Hope.

===Honorary doctorate===
On May 7, 2011, Steven Chapman received an honorary doctorate of music degree from Anderson University and was the commencement speaker for the class of 2011.

==Activism and charity work==
In the late 1990s, Chapman became involved in youth violence prevention efforts following the 1997 Heath High School shooting at his alma mater in West Paducah. He dedicated a song, &quot;With Hope&quot;, from his 1999 album, &quot;Speechless&quot;, to the families who lost someone in the shooting. In addition, he was asked to sing at the joint funeral held for the three victims. Chapman later gave a memorial concert and joined Charles Colson and others in creating a video designed to sensitize teenagers to the signs of serious violence planning among peers and to encourage them to report plans that are told to them.

In 2009, Show Hope finished building Maria&#x27;s Big House of Hope, a medical care center in China that provides holistic care to orphans with special needs. Maria&#x27;s Big House of Hope is also dedicated to the memory of the late Maria Sue Chunxi Chapman. Also in 2009, Steven Chapman and Mary Beth Chapman received the Children&#x27;s Champion Award from the charitable organization Children&#x27;s Hunger Fund for their work with Show Hope. In September 2011, Chapman and his wife were awarded the Congressional Angels in Adoption award by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute (CCAI) in Washington, D.C.

Steven Chapman also has promoted the international charity World Vision for at least a decade, serving as spokesman for Project Restore, its program serving the U.S. Gulf Coast region in recovery from Hurricane Katrina, in cooperation with the Gospel Music Association. He has occasionally traveled to Uganda to help with the problem of street children, and to help orphans and adoption organizations. He has played at local churches, including KPC (Kampala Pentecostal Church) in Kampala, Uganda.

In 2020, Chapman was a featured guest at Keith &amp; Kristyn Getty&#x27;s Sing! Global 2020 Conference designed to train music leaders and instill the importance of solid doctrine and Gospel saturated lyrics in Christian music.

== Politics ==
During the 2016 presidential election, Chapman encouraged evangelical Christians to trust that &quot;God is on the throne&quot; and &quot;resist the urge to argue and fight with each other about our opinions.&quot; After the 2021 United States Capitol attack on January 6, Chapman released &quot;A Desperate Benediction&quot; as a live, home-studio video to his Facebook page. In the prose that accompanied the posting he wrote, &quot;now more than ever before, it seems like the soul of our world (&amp; our nation) is aching, longing and desperate for peace.&quot;

==Discography==

Chapman has released 23 studio albums, more than 25 albums total in his career, including 4 Christmas, 2 live, and several compilation albums. He has sold more than 11 million total albums (including two certified Platinum albums, eight certified Gold albums) and has had 49 No. 1 radio songs.

<doc id="344634" wikidata="Q460995" url="?curid=344634" title="List of Roman laws">
<text>This is a partial list of Roman laws. A Roman law () is usually named for the sponsoring legislator and designated by the adjectival form of his &quot;gens&quot; name (&quot;nomen gentilicum&quot;), in the feminine form because the noun &quot;lex&quot; (plural &quot;leges&quot;) is of feminine grammatical gender. When a law is the initiative of the two consuls, it is given the name of both, with the &quot;nomen&quot; of the senior consul first. Sometimes a law is further specified by a short phrase describing the content of the law, to distinguish that law from others sponsored by members of the same &quot;gens&quot;.

== Roman laws ==
== Post-Roman law codes based on Roman legislation ==

*&quot;lex Romana Burgundionum&quot; one of the law tables for Romans after the fall of the Western Roman Empire
*&quot;lex Romana Visigothorum&quot; (AD 506) one of the law tables for Romans after the fall of the Western Roman Empire

== General denominations ==

*&quot;lex agraria&quot; A law regulating distribution of public lands
*&quot;lex annalis&quot; A law regarding qualifications for magistracies, such as age or experience
*&quot;lex ambitus&quot; A law involving electoral bribery and corruption; see &quot;ambitus&quot;
*&quot;lex curiata&quot; Any law passed by the &quot;comitia curiata&quot;. These included Roman adoptions, particularly so-called &quot;testamentary adoptions&quot; (famously in 59 BC when the patrician Clodius Pulcher was adopted into a plebeian &quot;gens&quot; in order to run for the office of tribune of the &quot;plebs&quot;) and the &quot;lex curiata de imperio&quot; which granted &quot;imperium&quot; to senior Roman magistrates under the Republic, likely also ratifying the choice of a new king during the monarchy. It was the traditional basis for the later lex de Imperio allowing imperial succession.
*&quot;lex frumentaria&quot; A law regulating the price of grain
*&quot;lex sumptuaria&quot; A law regulating the use of luxury items and public manifestations of wealth

== Other ==
*&quot;Constitution of the Roman Republic&quot; Set the separation of powers and checks and balances of the Roman Republic
*&quot;Acceptilatio&quot; spoken statement of debt or obligation release
*&quot;Constitutio Antoniniana&quot; granted citizenship to the Empire&#x27;s freemen
*&quot;Corpus Iuris Civilis&quot; codification by emperor Justinian
*&quot;Syro-Roman law book&quot;a compilation of secular legal texts from the eastern Roman Empire
*&quot;Stipulatio&quot; basic oral contract
*&quot;Twelve Tables&quot; The first set of Roman laws published by the &quot;Decemviri&quot; in 451 BC, which would be the starting point of the elaborate Roman constitution. The twelve tables covered issues of civil, criminal and military law. Every Roman that went to school was supposed to know them by heart.

<text>This is a timeline of Roman history, comprising important legal and territorial changes and political events in the Roman Kingdom and Republic and the Roman and Byzantine Empires. To read about the background of these events, see Ancient Rome and History of the Byzantine Empire.

Events and persons of the Kingdom of Rome (and to some degree of the early Republic) are negros, and their accounts are considered to have varying degrees of veracity.

Following tradition, this timeline marks the deposition of Romulus Augustulus and the Fall of Constantinople as the end of Rome in the west and east, respectively. See Third Rome for a discussion of claimants to the succession of Rome.

<text>Carl Andrew Spaatz (born Spatz; 28 June 1891 – 14 July 1974), nicknamed &quot;Tooey&quot;, was an American World War II general. As commander of Strategic Air Forces in Europe in 1944, he successfully pressed for the bombing of the enemy&#x27;s oil production facilities as a priority over other targets. He became Chief of Staff of the newly formed United States Air Force in 1947.

==Early life==
Carl Andrew Spatz was born on 28 June 1891, in Boyertown, Pennsylvania, to Anna Amelia (née Muntz) and Charles Busch Spatz. Spaatz had an older sister Flora (1889–1971).

Of German ancestry, in 1937 Spaatz legally added the second &quot;a&quot; to his surname at the request of his wife and three daughters to clarify the pronunciation of the name, as many pronounced it &quot;spats&quot;. The second &quot;a&quot; was added, as it was in the European branch of his family, to draw out the sound like an &quot;ah&quot;, similar to the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;father.&quot; The name is thus correctly pronounced in American English identically to &quot;spots&quot;.

His father was a state senator who ran a printing shop and a small newspaper, &quot;The Berks County Democrat&quot;, which he published from 1904 to 1930. While a student his son worked as a linotype operator.

Using his influence his father was able to obtain a West Point appointment for his son. It was while at West Point that Spaatz received his nickname &quot;Tooey&quot; because of his resemblance to another red-headed cadet named F.J. Toohey. He graduated as a second lieutenant of Infantry on 12 June 1914, ranked 97th out of a class of 107. Other graduates included numerous men who would become general officers, such as Brehon B. Somervell, Charles P. Gross, Jens A. Doe, John B. Anderson, James L. Bradley, Orlando Ward, Harold Francis Loomis, Harold R. Bull, Frank W. Milburn, Ralph Royce, Vicente Lim, and Harry C. Ingles.

Following his graduation from West Point as an infantry lieutenant he served with the 25th Infantry at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, until his assignment to the Signal Corps Aviation School at San Diego, California, between 13 October 1915, and 15 May 1916, for pilot training. He was detailed to the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps in Mexico on 8 June 1916, after earning his Junior Military Aviator rating.

Spaatz served in the First Aero Squadron, which was attached to General John J. Pershing during the Punitive Expedition. Spaatz was promoted to first lieutenant on 1 July 1916, and to captain on 15 May 1917, a few weeks after the American entry into World War I.

==World War I==
Following America&#x27;s entry into World War I, Spaatz was sent with the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in command of the 31st Aero Squadron. Spaatz was appointed Officer in Charge, American Aviation School at Issoudun, France but after receiving orders to return to the United States, he saw three weeks of action during the final months of the war with the 13th Aero Squadron as a supernumerary pilot. In this brief period, Spaatz shot down three enemy planes and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross; during the time he was promoted to the temporary rank of major on 17 June 1918.

==Interwar==
In early 1919, Spaatz was appointed to lead one of the three &quot;troupes&quot; of the U.S. Army Air Service Victory Loan Flying Circus. His group consisted of about twenty-five officers and fifty enlisted men. His airplanes on the tour included five JN6 Jennies, five Fokker D VIIs, four RAE SE-5s and five Spad VIIs. The team gave promotional rides and flew aerial demonstrations across the Western and Southwestern United States from early April through mid-May 1919 to raise money to retire the World War I debt.

Spaatz served in California and Texas and became assistant department air service officer for the Western Department in July 1919. Spaatz experienced the chaotic ups and downs in rank common to Regular officers in 1920, when the National Defense Act of 1920 reorganized the military. He first reverted to his permanent rank of captain of Infantry on 27 February 1920. On 1 July, when the Air Service became a combatant arm of the line, he transferred to the Air Service as a captain, then was promoted to major on the same date by virtue of a provision in the National Defense Act that allowed officers who earned their rank in service with the AEF to retain it. This made him senior to a number of officers, including Henry H. Arnold (his superior at the time), with greater longevity of service. On 18 December 1922, Spaatz was discharged when Congress set a new ceiling on the number of majors authorized for the Air Service, and reappointed as a captain, then promoted again to major on 1 February 1923.

As a major, Spaatz commanded Kelly Field, Texas, from 5 October 1920, to February 1921, served at Fort Sam Houston as air officer of the Eighth Corps Area until November 1921, and was commanding officer of the 1st Pursuit Group, first at Ellington Field, Texas, and later at Selfridge Field, Michigan, until 24 September 1924. He graduated from the Air Corps Tactical School, Langley Field, Virginia, in June 1925, and then served in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps at Washington, D.C. Later that year he testified for the defence at the court-martial of Colonel Billy Mitchell.

From 1 to 7 January 1929, Spaatz along with fellow Air Corps officers, Captain Ira Eaker and Lieutenant Elwood Quesada, both of whom would later become senior United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) generals, established an aviation record by keeping the airplane &quot;Question Mark&quot; in the air over the Los Angeles vicinity for over 150 hours. For his efforts he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

From 8 May 1929, to 29 October 1931, Spaatz commanded the 7th Bombardment Group at Rockwell Field, California, and the 1st Bombardment Wing at March Field, California, until 10 June 1933. He then served in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps and became chief of the Training and Operations Division. In August 1935, he enrolled in the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and while there was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 16 September. He graduated in June 1936, and then served at Langley Field on the staff of Major General Frank M. Andrews, commander of General Headquarters Air Force, until January 1939, when he returned to the Office of the Chief of Air Corps at Washington as assistant executive officer.

On 7 November 1939, Spaatz received a temporary promotion to colonel, and during the Battle of Britain in 1940, spent several weeks in England as a special military observer. This roving assignment when combined with his Teutonic name gave rise to rumors to which he once responded by signing in at a British airbase as &quot;Col. Carl A. Spaatz, German spy.&quot;

In August, he was assigned in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps, and two months later was appointed assistant to the chief of Air Corps, General Arnold, with the temporary rank of brigadier general. He became chief of the Plans Division of the Air Corps in November 1940, and the following July was named chief of the air staff at Army Air Forces Headquarters.

==World War II==

Army Chief of Staff George Marshall named Spaatz commander of Air Force Combat Command in January 1942 and promoted him to the temporary rank of major general. In May 1942 Spaatz became commander of the Eighth Air Force and transferred its headquarters to England in July. Spaatz was placed in overall command of the USAAF in the European Theater of Operations, while retaining his Eighth Air Force command. He was promoted to the permanent rank of colonel in September 1942. He was named commander of the Allied Northwest African Air Force in February 1943, the Twelfth Air Force in March 1943, the Fifteenth Air Force, and Royal Air Forces in Italy in November 1943, and the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe in January 1944. Spaatz received a temporary promotion to lieutenant general in March 1943.

As commander of Strategic Air Forces, Spaatz directed the United States portion of the strategic bombing campaign against Germany, directing the Eighth Air Force, which was then commanded by Lieutenant General Jimmy Doolittle, based in England, and the Fifteenth Air Force, which was now commanded by Lieutenant General Nathan Twining, based in Italy.

As the commander of Strategic Air Forces in Europe, Spaatz was under the direct command of General Dwight Eisenhower. In March 1944, Spaatz proposed the Oil Plan for bombing, and in June 1944 during the Operation Crossbow priority bombing of V-1 sites aimed at the UK, Spaatz advocated, and received authorization from Eisenhower for, bombing of those targets at a lower priority. Spaatz also identified that &quot;...the chimera of one air operation that will end the war...does not exist&quot;, and advocated Tedder&#x27;s plan &quot;which retained the oil system in first position, but more clearly placed Germany&#x27;s rail system in second priority&quot;, which encouraged Eisenhower to overrule Air Ministry fears that the &quot;thrust against the oil industry&quot; might be weakened. Spaatz&#x27;s &quot;Oil Plan&quot; became the highest bombing priority in September 1944. After the war, Eisenhower said that Spaatz, along with General Omar Bradley, was one of the two American general officers who had contributed the most to the victory in Europe.

Spaatz received promotion to the rank of general on 11 March 1945. After VE Day he was transferred to the Pacific and assumed command of the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific as part of the Pacific Theatre of Operations, with headquarters on Guam, in July 1945. From this command, Spaatz directed the strategic bombing of Japan, including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Spaatz was present at Reims when the Germans surrendered to the Americans on 7 May 1945; at Berlin when they surrendered to the Soviets on 8 May; and aboard the battleship in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese surrendered on 2 September. He was the only man of general rank or equivalent present at all three of these acts of surrender. On 10 May, Spaatz conducted an interrogation of Hermann Göring along with an American historian Bruce Campbell Hopper at the Ritter School in Augsburg, Germany.

== Civil Air Patrol ==

From 1948 until 1959, he served as the first Chairman of Civil Air Patrol&#x27;s National Board. In 1964, CAP honored him by making his name synonymous with the highest cadet achievement, C/Colonel. The award&#x27;s first recipient being C/Col Douglas C. Roach from Michigan Wing in November of the same year. Since then, only 2,280 cadets have received this honor nationwide (as of February 2022).

==Later life==
In July 1945, President Harry S. Truman nominated Spaatz for promotion to the permanent rank of general. Spaatz succeeded Arnold as Commanding General of the Army Air Forces on 11 February 1946. After the creation of the independent Air Force by the National Security Act of 1947 and Truman&#x27;s Executive Order No. 9877, Spaatz was appointed as the first Chief of Staff of the new United States Air Force in September 1947.

Spaatz retired from the military at the rank of general on 30 June 1948, and worked for &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine as military affairs editor until 1961. He also served on the Committee of Senior Advisors to the Air Force Chief of Staff from 1952 until his death; and was the first President of the Air Force Historical Foundation during 1953. In 1954, Spaatz was appointed to the congressional advisory board set up to determine the site for the new United States Air Force Academy.

Spaatz died at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C., on 14 July 1974, from congestive heart failure.

He was buried at the Academy&#x27;s cemetery in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

==Personal life==
Spaatz married Ruth Harrison in 1917. Ruth was born on 28 April 1896, in Fort Riley, Kansas. She died on 19 November 1989, in Maryland. The couple had three children.

Katherine (&quot;Tattie&quot;) served in the American Red Cross mobile unit in England during World War II and later married British intelligence officer Walter Bell (diplomat) 1948. She died in 2005. Rebecca married Emmet B. Gresham, Jr. (25 March 1923 – 25 February 1954) on 13 February 1943. Following his death Rebecca married Steven P. Nagel.

Carla married Francis D. Thomas Jr. at Fort Myer on 4 April 1951.

===Distinguished Service Cross citation===
;Citation:
&quot;The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, 9 July 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Major (Air Service) Carl Andrew Spatz (ASN: 0–3706), United States Army Air Service, for extraordinary heroism in action while serving with 13th Aero Squadron, U.S. Army Air Service, A.E.F., during the St. Mihiel offensive, 26 September 1918. Although he had received orders to go to the United States, Major Spatz begged for and received permission to serve with a pursuit squadron at the front. Subordinating himself to men of lower rank, he was attached to a squadron as a pilot and saw continuous and arduous service through the offensive. As a result of his efficient work he was promoted to the position of night commander. Knowing that another attack was to take place in the vicinity of Verdun, he remained on duty in order to take part. On the day of the attack west of the Meuse, while with his patrol over enemy lines, a number of enemy aircraft were encountered. In the combat that followed he succeeded in bringing down three enemy planes. In his ardor and enthusiasm he became separated from his patrol while following another enemy far beyond the lines. His gasoline giving out, he was forced to land and managed to land within friendly territory. Through these acts he became an inspiration and example to all men with whom he was associated.&quot;

<text>Pinot gris, pinot grigio (, ), or Grauburgunder is a white wine grape variety of the species &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;. Thought to be a mutant clone of the pinot noir variety, it normally has a pinkish-gray hue, accounting for its name, but the colors can vary from blue-gray to pinkish-brown. The word &quot;pinot&quot; could have been given to it because the grapes grow in small pinecone-shaped clusters. The wines produced from this grape also vary in color from a deep golden yellow to copper and even a light shade of pink, and it is one of the more popular grapes for skin-contact wine.

Pinot gris is grown around the globe, with the &quot;spicy&quot; full-bodied Alsatian and lighter-bodied, more acidic Italian styles being most widely recognized. The Alsatian style, often duplicated in New World wine regions such as Marlborough, Oregon, South Africa, South Australia, Tasmania, and Washington, tend to have moderate to low acidity, higher alcohol levels, and an almost &quot;oily&quot; texture that contributes to the full-bodied nature of the wine. The flavors can range from ripe tropical fruit notes of melon and mango to some botrytis-influenced flavors. In Italy, pinot grigio grapes are often harvested early to retain the refreshing acidity and minimize some of the overt fruitiness of the variety, creating a more neutral flavor profile]. This style is often imitated in other Old World wine regions, such as Germany, where the grape is known as &quot;Ruländer&quot; or more commonly, &quot;Grauburgunder&quot;.

== History ==

Pinot gris has been known since the Middle Ages in the Burgundy region, where it was probably called Fromenteau. It spread from Burgundy, along with pinot noir, arriving in Switzerland by 1300. The grape was reportedly a favorite of Emperor Charles IV, who had cuttings exported to Hungary by Cistercian monks: the brothers planted the vines on the slopes of Badacsony bordering Lake Balaton in 1375. The vine soon after developed the name &quot;Szürkebarát&quot; &quot;grey monk&quot;. In 1711, a German merchant named Johann Seger Ruland rediscovered a grape growing wild in the fields of the Palatinate. The subsequent wine he produced became known as &quot;Ruländer&quot;, although the vine was later discovered to be pinot gris.

Until the 18th and 19th centuries, the grape was a popular planting in Burgundy and Champagne, but poor yields and unreliable crops caused the grape to fall out of favor in those areas. The same fate nearly occurred in Germany, but vine breeders in the early 20th century were able to develop clonal varieties that would produce a more consistent and reliable crop.

Researchers at the University of California, Davis, determined that pinot gris has a remarkably similar DNA profile to pinot noir and that the color difference is derived from a genetic mutation that occurred centuries ago. The leaves and the vines of both grapes are so similar that the coloration is the only aspect that differentiates the two.

Santa Margherita wine group, a wine producer located in the north of Italy, was the first company in the world in 1961 to vinify pink pinot grigio grapes as a white wine.

Around 2005, pinot gris began to enjoy increasing popularity in the marketplace, especially in its pinot grigio incarnation and similar New World varietal wines.

==== Alsace ====

A major grape in Alsace, grown on 13.9 percent of the region&#x27;s vineyard surface in 2006, the varietal is markedly different from pinot gris found elsewhere. The cool climate of Alsace and warm volcanic soils are particularly well suited for pinot gris, with its dry autumns allowing plenty of time for the grapes to hang on the vines, often resulting in wines of very powerful flavors.

Pinot gris is one of the so-called noble grapes of Alsace, along with Riesling, Gewürztraminer, and muscat, which may be used for varietal Alsace Grand Cru AOC and the late harvest wines Vendange Tardive and Sélection de Grains Nobles.

Previously, the pinot gris wines produced in Alsace were originally labeled Tokay d&#x27;Alsace. In the Middle Ages, the grape was popularized in the region by Hungarian traders who were introduced to the grape from Burgundy. During this time, Tokaji was one of the most popular and sought-after wines on the market, and the name was probably used to gain more prestige for the Alsatian wine. Pinot gris was believed to have been brought back to Alsace by General Lazarus von Schwendi after his campaign against the Turks in the 16th century. It was planted in Kientzheim under the name &quot;Tokay&quot;. However, the pinot gris grape has no known genetic relations to the Furmint, Hárslevelű, Yellow Muscat, and Orémus grapes that are traditionally used in Tokaji wine. In 1980, the European Economic Community passed regulations related to protected designations of origin (PDOs), and when Hungary started negotiations for European Union membership, it became clear that the Tokay name would have to become a PDO for the Tokaj-Hegyalja region. Therefore, in 1993, an agreement was reached between Hungary and the European Union to phase out the name Tokay from non-Hungarian wine. In the case of Alsace, Tokay pinot gris was adopted as an intermediate step, with the &quot;Tokay&quot; part to be eliminated in 2007. Many producers had implemented the change to plain pinot gris on their labels by the early 2000s, several years before the deadline.

In the Loire Valley, pinot gris produces a single-variety rose wine described as &quot;gris&quot; in Reuilly AOC.

=== Australia ===
Pinot gris was first introduced into Australia in 1832 in the collection of grapes brought by James Busby. In Victoria, wines from the grape are labeled both Pinot gris and Pinot grigio, depending on the sweetness of wine, with the drier wines being labeled Pingt Grigio.

=== Germany ===
&quot;Grauburgunder&quot; cultivation in Germany is divided by wine-growing area as follows:

=== Hungary ===
In Hungary, this variety of wine is called Szürkebarát and is produced primarily in the Badacsony, Mátra, and Balaton-felvidék regions.

=== Italy ===

In Italy, where the grape is known as Pinot grigio, plantings can be found in the Lombardy region around Oltrepò Pavese and in South Tyrol, Italy&#x27;s northernmost wine region. The grape is also prominent in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region.

=== New Zealand ===
Pinot gris is grown in both the North Island, (Waiheke Island, Hawkes Bay, Gisborne) and the South Island (Central Otago, Nelson, Marlborough, Waipara), with producing . This is a nearly eight-fold increase since 2003. In 2007, Pinot gris overtook Riesling as the third most planted white variety after Sauvignon blanc and Chardonnay. Half of all plantings are in Canterbury and Marlborough, with the wine developing a &quot;rich, flinty, fruit-laden character&quot;.

=== United States ===

David Lett from Eyrie Vineyards planted the first American Pinot gris vines in Oregon in 1965. Hoping to increase sales, Lett started to graft Riesling vines to Pinot gris in 1979. The grape originally had difficulties finding a sustainable market until Lett began marketing the wine to salmon traders as a good match to the fish. The wine&#x27;s popularity only increased slightly until the mid-1990s, when well-capitalized larger producers entered the picture with enough volume to warrant expensive marketing. In 1991, King Estate Winery was the world&#x27;s leading producer of premium Pinot gris and farmed the world&#x27;s largest contiguous organic vineyard, which contains over of Pinot gris grapes.

There are about planted in the Central and South coastal areas of California. The Pinot gris from California is often called Pinot grigio because of its similarity in style to the wine of Italy.

Pinot gris can be found in the northern regions of Ohio, which is considered part of the pinot trail.

=== Canada ===
As &quot;Pinot Grigio&quot; the grape has found significant success particularly in the wine growing region of Niagara, Ontario, where the cooler climate and soils offer ideal growing conditions. Pinot Grigio from Niagara displays crisp vibrant acidity and delicate fruit flavours.

== Viticulture ==
Pinot gris thrives in cooler climates, with the major growing regions being Alsace in France, north-eastern Italy and the US state of Oregon. This can lead to either a sweeter wine or if fermented to dryness, a wine high in alcohol. Clusters of Pinot gris may have a variety of colors on the vine. The grapes grow in small clusters (hence the pinecone name) and, upon ripening, often display a pinkish-gray hue, although the colors can vary from blue-gray to pinkish-brown.
Pinot gris is often blended with Pinot Noir to enrich and lighten the Pinot Noir&#x27;s flavor.

== Wine characteristics ==

Wines made from the Pinot gris vary greatly and are dependent on the region and wine-making style they are from. Alsatian Pinot gris are medium to full-bodied wines with a rich, somewhat floral bouquet. They tend to be spicy in comparison with other Pinot gris. While most Pinot gris are meant to be consumed early, Alsatian Pinot gris can age well. German Pinot gris are more full-bodied with a balance of acidity and slight sweetness. In Oregon, the wines are medium-bodied with a yellow to copper-pink color and aromas of pear, apple, and/or melon. In California, the Pinot gris are more light-bodied with a crisp, refreshing taste with some pepper and arugula notes. The Pinot grigio style of Italy is a light-bodied, often lean wine that is light in color with sometimes spritzy flavors that can be crisp and acidic.

Pinot gris is considered an &quot;early to market wine&quot; that can be bottled and out on the market within 4–12 weeks after fermentation.

<doc id="344654" wikidata="Q810196" url="?curid=344654" title="Basingstoke">
<text>Basingstoke ( ) is a town in Hampshire, situated in south-central England across a valley at the source of the River Loddon on the western edge of the North Downs. It is the largest settlement in Hampshire without city status. It is located north-east of Southampton, south-west of London, west of Guildford, south of Reading and north-east of the county town and former capital Winchester. According to the 2016 population estimate, the town had a population of 113,776. It is part of the borough of Basingstoke and Deane and part of the parliamentary constituency of Basingstoke.

Basingstoke is an old market town expanded in the mid-1960s, as a result of an agreement between London County Council and Hampshire County Council. It was developed rapidly after the Second World War, along with various other towns in the United Kingdom, in order to accommodate part of the London &#x27;overspill&#x27; as perceived under the Greater London Plan in 1944. Basingstoke market was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 and it remained a small market town until the early 1960s. At the start of the Second World War, the population was little more than 13,000. It still has a regular market, but is now larger than Hampshire County Council&#x27;s definition of a market town.

Basingstoke became an important economic centre during the second half of the 20th century and houses the locations of the UK headquarters of Motorola, The Automobile Association, De La Rue, Sun Life Financial, ST Ericsson, GAME, Barracuda Networks, Eli Lilly and Company, FCB Halesway part of FCB, BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions (the leasing arm of BNP Paribas in the UK) and Sony Professional Solutions. It is also the location of the European headquarters of the TaylorMade Golf Company. Other industries include IT, telecommunications, insurance and electronics.

== Etymology ==
The name Basingstoke (A.D 990; Embasinga stocæ, Domesday; Basingestoches) is believed to have been derived from the town&#x27;s position as the outlying, western settlement of Basa&#x27;s people. Basing, now Old Basing, a village to the east, is thought to have the same etymology, and was the original Anglo-Saxon settlement of the people – Basingas – led by a tribal chief called &quot;Basa&quot;. Basing remained the main settlement until changes in the local church moved the religious base from St Marys Church, Basing, to the church in Basingstoke.

== History ==

=== Early settlements ===
A Neolithic campsite of around 3000 BC beside a spring on the west of the town is the earliest known human settlement here, but the Willis Museum has flint implements and axes from nearby fields that date back to Palæolithic times. The hillfort at Winklebury ( west of the town centre), known locally as Winklebury Camp or Winklebury Ring dates from the Iron Age and there are remains of several other earthworks around Basingstoke, including a long barrow near Down Grange. The site of Winklebury camp was home to Fort Hill Community School (this school has shut down). Nearby, to the west, Roman Road marks the course of a Roman road that ran from Winchester to Silchester. Further to the east, another Roman road ran from Chichester through the outlying villages of Upton Grey and Mapledurwell. The Harrow Way is an Iron-age ancient route that runs to the south of the town. The first recorded historical event in the area was the defeat of King Æthelred of Wessex and his brother Alfred the Great at Old Basing by the Danes in 871.

=== Market town ===
Basingstoke is recorded as a weekly market site in the Domesday Book, in 1086, and has held a regular Wednesday market since 1214.
During the Civil War, and the siege of Basing House between 1643 and 1645, the town played host to large numbers of Parliamentarians. During this time, St. Michael&#x27;s Church was damaged whilst being used as an explosive store and lead was stripped from the roof of the Chapel of the Holy Ghost, Basingstoke leading to its eventual ruin. It had been incorporated in 1524, but was effectively out of use after the Civil War. The 17th century saw serious damage to much of the town and its churches, because of the great fires of 1601 and 1656. Cromwell is thought to have stayed here towards the end of the siege of Basing House, and wrote a letter to the Speaker of the House of Commons addressed from Basingstoke.

The cloth industry appears to have been important in the development of the town until the 17th century along with malting. Brewing became important during the 18th and 19th centuries, and the oldest and most successful brewery was May&#x27;s Brewery, established by Thomas and William May in 1750 in Brook Street.

=== Victorian history ===

The London and South Western Railway arrived in 1839 from London, and within a year it was extended to Winchester and Southampton. In 1848 a rival company, sponsored by the Great Western Railway built a branch from Reading. In 1854 a line was built to Salisbury by the London and South Western. In the 19th century Basingstoke began to move into industrial manufacture, Wallis and Haslam (later Wallis &amp; Steevens), began producing agricultural equipment including threshing machines in the 1850s, moving into the production of stationary steam engines in the 1860s and then traction engines in the 1870s.

Two traders who opened their first shops within a year of each other in the town, went on to become household names nationally: Thomas Burberry in 1856 and Alfred Milward in 1857. Burberry became famous after he invented Gabardine and Milward founded the Milwards chain of shoe shops, which could be found on almost every high street until the 1980s.

John May, a member of the brewery family, was several times mayor of the town. A benefactor to the town, he paid for the building of a drill hall in Sarum Hill for the use of the Hampshire Volunteers (later used as a cinema and then a furniture shop) and a wing for the Cottage Hospital in Hackwood Road. The drill hall was opened in 1885 and also used for concerts and exhibitions. He also bought a piece of open space that was about to be sold for housing and let it at a low rent to the Basingstoke Cricket Club. This cricket ground is still in use and is called &quot;May&#x27;s Bounty&quot;.

Ordinary citizens were said to be shocked by the emotive, evangelical tactics of the Salvation Army when they arrived in the town in 1880, but the reaction from those employed by the breweries or within the licensed trade quickly grew more openly hostile. Violent clashes became a regular occurrence. On Sunday 27 March 1881 troops were called upon to break up the conflict after the Mayor had read the Riot Act. The riot and its causes led to questions in Parliament and a period of notoriety for the town. The town was described as &#x27;Barbarous Basingstoke&#x27; by one London newspaper in 1882 but by March 1882 the disturbances were dying down.
In 1898 John Isaac Thornycroft began production of steam-powered lorries in the town and Thornycroft&#x27;s quickly grew to become the town&#x27;s largest employer.

=== Recent history ===
Basingstoke suffered very little bomb damage during the Second World War. A stick of German bombs did fall in the Church Square area on 16 August 1940. The same day bombs destroyed part of a row of houses in Burgess Road. Six people were killed in the raid. Overall, 13 civilians died from enemy action during the war in the town. After the war, the town had a population of 25,000.

As part of the London Overspill plan, along with places such as Ashford and Swindon, Basingstoke was rapidly developed in the late 1960s as an &#x27;expanded town&#x27;, in similar fashion to Milton Keynes. As the population increased, the town produced more figures of national importance, such as the art critic Waldemar Januszczak and the actress Elizabeth Hurley. Many office blocks and large estates were built, as well as a ring road. The shopping centre was built in phases. The first phase was completed by the 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s, and was known as The Walks. The second phase was completed by the early 1980s, and became The Malls. The third phase was abandoned and the site was later used to build the Anvil concert hall. The central part of the shopping centre was rebuilt in 2002 and reopened as Festival Place. This has brought a dramatic improvement to shoppers&#x27; opinions of the town centre.

== Geography ==
Situated in a valley through the Hampshire Downs at an average elevation of Basingstoke is a major interchange between Reading, Newbury, Andover, Winchester, and Alton, and lies on the natural trade route between the southwest of England and London. The area had been something of an interchange even in ancient times. It had been cut by a Roman roadway that ran from northeast to southwest, from Silchester towards Salisbury (Sorbiodunum), and by another Roman road that linked Silchester (Calleva Atrebatum) in the north with Winchester (Venta Belgarum) to the south. These cross-cutting highways, along with the good agricultural land hereabouts, account for the many &quot;Roman&quot; villas in the area, mostly put up by Romanized native nobility (Roman villa). Even more ancient was the Harrow Way, a Neolithic trackway, possibly associated with the ancient tin trade, that crossed all of southern England from west to east, from Cornwall to Kent, passing right through Andover and Basingstoke.

=== Physical geography and geology ===
Basingstoke has no single boundary that encompasses all the areas contiguous to its development. The unparished area of the town represents its bulk, but several areas popularly considered part of the town are separate parishes, namely Chineham, Rooksdown, and parts of Old Basing and Lychpit. The unparished area includes Worting which was previously a separate village and parish,
extending beyond Roman Road and Old Kempshott Lane, which might otherwise be considered the town&#x27;s &#x27;natural&#x27; western extremity.

Basingstoke is situated on a bed of cretaceous upper chalk with small areas of clayey and loamy soil, inset with combined clay and flint patches. Loam and alluvium recent and pleistocene sediments line the bed of the river Loddon. A narrow line of tertiary Reading beds run diagonally from the northwest to the southeast along a line from Sherborne St John through Popley, Daneshill and the north part of Basing. To the north of this line, encompassing the areas of Chineham and Pyotts Hill, is London clay, which has in the past allowed excavation for high quality brick and tile manufacture.

=== Divisions and suburbs ===
Basingstoke&#x27;s expansion has absorbed much surrounding farmland and scattered housing, transforming it into housing estates or local districts. Many of these new estates are designed as almost self-contained communities, such as Lychpit, Chineham, Popley, Winklebury, Oakridge, Kempshott, Brighton Hill, Viables, South Ham, Black Dam, Buckskin and South Ham Extension and Hatch Warren. The M3 acts as a buffer zone to the south of the town, and the South West Main Line constrains the western expansion, with a green belt to the north and north-east. The villages of Cliddesden, Dummer, Sherborne St John and Oakley, although being very close to the town limits, are distinct parishes. Popley, Hatch Warren and Beggarwood saw rapid growth in housing in the mid to late 2000s.

=== Demography ===
The population of Basingstoke increased from around 2,500 in 1801 to over 52,000 in 1971; the most significant growth occurring during the latter half of the 20th century. The borough of Basingstoke was merged with other local districts in 1974 to form the borough of Basingstoke and Deane, and census data from that point covers the whole borough.

Figures published for the UK census in 2011 for the Borough of Basingstoke and Deane give a population of 167,799 and a population density of 2.7 persons per hectare—only about half the national figure. The number of women slightly exceeded that of men, and a slight increase in the percentage of residents over 65 was also noted. Among other findings in 2001 were that 74.33 per cent felt they were in good health, 50.98 per cent were economically active full-time employees (over 10 per cent higher than the national average) and 48.73 per cent were buying their property with a mortgage or loan (almost 10 per cent higher than the national average).
Amongst the working population, 64.2 per cent travelled less than to work. The biggest percentage of employees, 17.67 per cent, worked in real estate, renting and business activities.

== Governance ==
Basingstoke is part of a two-tier local government structure and returns county councillors to Hampshire County Council. It is the third largest settlement in the ceremonial county, but when the cities of Southampton and Portsmouth attained unitary authority status in 1998, Basingstoke became the largest settlement in the county administered by the county council.

Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council is the lower-tier local authority for the town, and has its offices in the town centre. Elections to the council take place in 3 out of every 4 years.

Under the town twinning scheme, the local council have twinned Basingstoke with Alençon in France, Braine-l&#x27;Alleud in Belgium, and Euskirchen in Germany.

== Facilities ==
The Top of Town is the historic heart of Basingstoke, housing the Willis Museum in the former Town Hall building (rebuilt 1832) as well as several locally run shops and the market place.

Basingstoke is home to two theatrical organisations: the Haymarket, which is situated in the former Corn Exchange, and The Anvil, which is near the railway station.

The Willis Museum was founded and directed by Alderman George W. Willis, a local clocksmith, who served as Mayor of Basingstoke in 1923–24. Willis established the museum in 1931 with much public support, and built its holdings up into a major collection on local history, with a particularly extensive collection of prehistoric implements and of antique clocks and watches. His association with the expanding museum continued for forty years. The museum&#x27;s central location today is where, once upon a time, Jane Austen and her sister used to go to dances, and a statue of Jane Austen was installed outside the museum in 2017, on the 200th anniversary of her death. Although ostensibly set in Hertford, Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, written in 1797, is thought to have been based on her view of Basingstoke society two centuries ago.

The major shopping area is Festival Place, which opened in October 2002. Festival Place gave a huge boost to the town centre, transforming and replacing what was the former The Walks Shopping Centre and the New Market Square. Aside from a wide range of shops, there is also a range of cafés and restaurants as well as a large multiscreen Vue cinema (formerly Ster Century from Festival Place&#x27;s opening until their takeover in 2005; the pre-existing Vue in the Leisure Park was sold to Odeon).

The Malls is a shopping area linked by a gateway entrance to the rail station. It had declined since the opening of Festival Place and the closure of its Allders department store. The leasehold was purchased in 2004 by the St Modwen development group in partnership with the Kuwait property investment company Salhia Real Estate, with provision for redevelopment The redevelopment of The Malls started in late 2010. A clear roof canopy was installed to protect the Malls from bad weather while still allowing natural light and air in. The Malls has been repaved and new street furniture installed. The redevelopment was completed in the last quarter of 2011. The redevelopment work was carried out by Wates Group using a variety of subcontractors.

A large Waitrose store is located near the station. It was built in November 2015 as part of the redevelopment of Basing View. A John Lewis at home store which was part of the same redevelopment closed down in 2021.

The town&#x27;s nightlife is split between the new Festival Square, and the traditional hostelries at the Top of Town, with a few local community pubs outside the central area. The town has four nightclubs, two in the town itself, one on the east side and one out to the west.

The Basingstoke Sports Centre is located in Portchester Square. The sports centre has a subterranean swimming pool, sauna, jacuzzi and steam room. Above ground there is a gym, aerobics studios, squash courts and main hall. There is also an Ofsted-registered crèche.

=== Sport and leisure ===
Outside the town centre there is a leisure park featuring the Aquadrome swimming pool, which opened in May 2002. Also located at the leisure park are an ice rink, a bowling alley, an indoor sky-diving centre with ski and surf machines, a Bingo club and a ten-screen Odeon (formerly Vue prior to the takeover of the Ster Century cinema in Festival Place, and before that, Warner-Village) cinema, as well as a restaurant and fast food outlets. The leisure park is home to the Milestones Museum, a living history museum which contains a network of streets and buildings based on the history of Hampshire.

Basingstoke has a football club, Basingstoke Town F.C., the Basingstoke Rugby Football Club and the Basingstoke Bison ice hockey team. Basingstoke also has a swimming team, known as the Basingstoke Bluefins and an American Flag Football Team known as the Basingstoke Zombie Horde. Further sporting organisations in the area include Basingstoke &amp; Mid Hants Athletic Club, Basingstoke Demons Floorball Club, Basingstoke Volleyball Club, Basingstoke Bulls Korfball Club and Lasham Gliding Society. The home ground of Basingstoke &amp; North Hants Cricket Club, Mays Bounty, was until 2000 used once a season by Hampshire County Cricket Club. As of 2011, Basingstoke has a roller derby league and team, the Basingstoke Bullets. Due to difficulty finding a suitable venue, the team practice in nearby Whitchurch. Basingstoke is also the home of Rising Phoenix Cheer, a successful competitive Allstar Cheerleading programme for athletes from age 5 upwards, training at Aldworth school.

=== Musical groups ===
Basingstoke has a wide diversity for musical groups ranging from brass bands to symphony orchestras. The Basingstoke Concert Band is a traditional wind band which has now been in existence for more than 35 years. The band was started in 1977 by Lawrie Shaw when Brighton Hill Community School opened, where he was the first headteacher. Shaw formed the band as an evening class for amateur wind players and it was then known as the Brighton Hill Centre Band.

=== Media ===
There are two local newspapers – the &quot;Basingstoke Gazette&quot;, and the &quot;Basingstoke Observer&quot;. The town is also covered by the broadsheet newspaper &quot;Hampshire Chronicle&quot;.

Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian, with BBC London and ITV London also received in the town.

Basingstoke is served by two regional radio stations. Greatest Hits Radio Berkshire &amp; North Hampshire, serving North Hampshire and parts of Surrey and Sussex, and Heart South, previously broadcast from Reading. BBC Radio Berkshire is available in the town. The town has coverage from digital radio; the BBC, Independent National and Now Reading multiplexes can be received in the town, and the outskirts can receive London and South Hampshire stations as well. The BBC national stations and DAB coverage is enhanced by a small relay just south of the town centre.

The local radio Station is HHCR - Basingstoke&#x27;s Community Radio, an internet-based broadcaster opened on 3 June 2019 by Cllr Diane Taylor Mayor of Basingstoke and Deane.

== Education ==
The Holy Ghost School (subsequently Queen Mary&#x27;s School for Boys) was a state funded grammar school operating in Basingstoke for four centuries, from 1556 until 1970, producing nationally recognised alumni such as Revd. Gilbert White (1720–1793), a pioneer naturalist, and the famed cricket commentator, John Arlott (1914–1991).

In modern times education in Basingstoke has been co-ordinated by Hampshire County Council. Each neighbourhood in the town has at least one primary school, while secondary schools are distributed around the town on larger campuses. Basingstoke has two large further education colleges: a sixth form college, Queen Mary&#x27;s College (QMC) and Basingstoke College of Technology (BCoT). The University of Winchester had a campus in Basingstoke (Chute House Campus) which closed in July 2011; it had offered full-time and part-time university courses in subjects including childhood studies, various management pathways, community development and creative industries. Bournemouth University&#x27;s health and social care students can work on placement at the North Hampshire Hospital. The hospital only caters for midwifery students.

== Transport ==

===Road===
Basingstoke is situated close to junctions 6, 7 and 8 of the M3 motorway, which skirts the town&#x27;s south-eastern edge, linking the town to London, and to Southampton and the south-west. The central area of the town is encircled by The Ringway, a ring road constructed in the 1960s, and is bisected east to west by the A3010 (Churchill Way). The A33 runs north-east to Reading and the M4 motorway, and south-west to Winchester. The A30 runs east to Hook and west to Salisbury. The A303 to Wiltshire and the West Country begins a few miles south-west of Basingstoke, sharing the first few miles with the A30. On the M3, there is a flyover, which passes over the slip road to A303, near Junction 8. The A339 runs south-east to Alton and north-west to Newbury.

===Railway===
The South West Main Line runs east and west through the centre of the town and Basingstoke railway station, linking Basingstoke to London Waterloo, Winchester, Southampton, Bournemouth and Weymouth. The West of England line links Basingstoke to Salisbury and to Exeter. The Reading–Basingstoke line runs north-east to Reading and is part of an important through route for longer distance services to Birmingham and the North.

The town was the terminus of the defunct Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway.

Current rail services from Basingstoke are operated by South Western Railway, CrossCountry and Great Western Railway. The Reading-Basingstoke Line runs parallel to Chineham Business Park, Vyne Park, the suburb of Chineham and Taylors Farm.

===Bus===
Most bus services in the town operate from Basingstoke bus station. The majority are provided by the Stagecoach Group through their Stagecoach in Hampshire sub-division. Basingstoke Community Transport and Communities First Wessex run some smaller routes.

A peak-time service is provided by Thames Valley Buses between Chineham Business Park and the railway station. National Express offers direct coach services to London and Southampton from the bus station.

===Cycling===
Separating cyclists from other road traffic was not part of the remit of the 1960s town redevelopment and, in 1996, the perception of provision for cyclists was very poor. Following the Basingstoke Area Cycling Strategy in 1999 an extensive cycle network was developed, mainly utilising on-road routes or off-road routes that run parallel with and directly alongside roads. Basingstoke was linked to Reading on the National Cycle Network route 23 in May 2003; the route was extended south to Alton and Alresford in April 2006.

=== Basingstoke Canal ===
The Basingstoke Canal started at a canal basin, roughly where the cinema in Festival Place is located. From there the canal ran alongside the River Loddon following the line of Eastrop Way. The old canal route passes under the perimeter ring road and then follows a long loop partly on an embankment to pass over small streams and water meadows towards Old Basing, where the route goes around the ruins of Basing House and then through and around the eastern edge of Old Basing. It followed another loop to go over small streams near the Hatch public house (a lot of this section was built over when constructing the M3) and headed across fields on an embankment towards Mapledurwell. The section of the canal from Up Nately to the western entrance of the Greywell Tunnel still exists and is a nature reserve; there is water in the canal and the canal towpath can be walked. A permissive footpath at the western entrance to the tunnel allows walkers to access public footpaths to get to the eastern entrance of the tunnel. The limit of navigation is about 500m east of the Greywell Tunnel. The renovated sections of the canal can then be navigated east towards West Byfleet where it joins the Wey Navigation, which itself can be navigated to the River Thames at Weybridge.

Aims to reconnect Basingstoke with the surviving sections of the Basingstoke Canal have been beset with difficulties, and actual restoration of a canal link is impossible. The Basingstoke Canal Society aspire to re-establish the route of the lost section of the canal as closely as possible with a footpath and cycleway.

== Religious sites ==
* The Anglican church of St. Michael&#x27;s is located west of Festival Place. The chancel dates from 1464, and the south chapel may be older. The nave and aisles were added fifty years later by Richard Foxe, Bishop of Winchester. The Memorial Chapel at the north-east corner of the church was completed in 1921. 
* The ruined Chapel of the Holy Ghost, north of the railway station, has not been a place of worship for four centuries, an effect of the Reformation. It was built by the first Lord Sandys, beginning in 1524, when King Henry VIII issued a charter of incorporation. The west tower of a 13th-century building also survives. It is surrounded by an ancient (as well as a more modern) cemetery; William, Lord Sandys himself lies buried in the chapel with his wife. 
* In 1902, the Catholic Holy Ghost Church was built by Alexander Scoles, named after the old chapel. It is a Grade II listed building. 
* The Church of St Mary, Eastrop is an old church, enlarged in 1912. 
* All Saints&#x27; Church was built in 1915, designed by Temple Moore. 
* St Peter&#x27;s Church was built in 1964-5, designed by Ronald Sims and is in a housing estate built in the 1960s. 
* In 2014, a group named Basingstoke Community Churches covered an area of six churches in the town. There are also an Assemblies of God church called Wessex Christian Fellowship, two Roman Catholic churches, St. Bede&#x27;s and St. Joseph&#x27;s, and churches of other denominations. 
* In 2019, Gateway Church Basingstoke began a partnership with Christians Against Poverty (CAP) to launch a Debt Centre in Basingstoke.

== International relations ==
Basingstoke is twinned with:
* Braine-l&#x27;Alleud, Wallonia, Belgium
* Alençon, Normandy, France
* Euskirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany

== Cultural associations ==
&quot;Basingstoke&quot; is a code word in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s 1887 comic opera &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, used by the &quot;bad baronet&quot; after he reforms, to remind his bride &quot;Mad Margaret&quot; of their plan to live lives of boring respectability. In 1895, Thomas Hardy referred to Basingstoke as &quot;Stoke Barehills&quot; in &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;.

Basingstoke&#x27;s North Hampshire Hospital was one of two hospitals used for the filming of Channel 4&#x27;s hit comedy &quot;Green Wing&quot;. George Formby&#x27;s film, &quot;He Snoops to Conquer&quot; was partly shot in the town in 1944 and in 1974 the National Film Board of Canada produced a documentary here called &quot;Basingstoke – Runcorn: British New Towns&quot;. The former Park Prewett Mental Hospital was the setting for the novel &quot;Poison in the Shade&quot; (1953), by Eric Benfield, a local author and sculptor who worked as an art therapist at that hospital.

Patrick Wilde&#x27;s 1993 play, &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong with Angry?&quot;, is set in Basingstoke. It was later adapted into the 1998 film, &quot;Get Real&quot;, which was filmed at various locations around Basingstoke.

<text>Retrocognition (also known as postcognition or hindsight), from the Latin &quot;retro&quot; meaning &quot;backward, behind&quot; and &quot;cognition&quot; meaning &quot;knowing,&quot; describes &quot;knowledge of a past event which could not have been learned or inferred by normal means.&quot; The term was coined by Frederic W. H. Myers.

==Overview==
Scientific researchers into psychic phenomena have long considered retrocognition untestable. To verify an accurate retrocognitive experience, existing documents and human knowledge must be consulted, which raises the possibility that the information was already known contemporaneously.

For instance, if you purport retrocognitive knowledge that &quot;Winston Churchill killed a parrot&quot;, the only way of verifying that knowledge would be to consult extant sources of Churchill&#x27;s activities. If it is found that he did, indeed, kill a parrot at one time; it could be said that you &quot;simply&quot; obtained contemporary knowledge of this fact (by clairvoyance or telepathy, if need be, of the relevant documents, or someone&#x27;s knowledge of them), rather than directly perceived – in the manner of retrocognition – any event in Churchill&#x27;s past. Given this fundamental logical difficulty, there has been very little experimental investigation by parapsychologists of retrocognition. The evidence for retrocognition has, therefore, been limited to naturalistic cases suggestive of the phenomenon.

The most popularly celebrated case of retrocognition concerns the visions in 1901 of Annie Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain – two scholars and early administrators of British university education for women – as they tried to find their way to Marie Antoinette&#x27;s private château, the Petit Trianon. Becoming lost on their way, they believed that they instead came unto the Queen&#x27;s presence itself. They published an account of their experience in 1911 as &quot;An Adventure&quot;. Moberly and Jourdain described how they had become convinced, over the following weeks, that persons they saw and even spoke to on that occasion – given certain details of dress, accent, topography and architecture – must have been of a presumed &quot;recollection&quot; by Marie Antoinette, on 10 August 1792, of her last days at Trianon in 1789. While often considered in popular literature as evidence for retrocognition, the book was immediately dismissed by Eleanor Sidgwick, a leading member of the British Society for Psychical Research, in an article published in its &quot;Proceedings&quot;, as the product of mutual confabulation.

<doc id="344663" wikidata="Q192265" url="?curid=344663" title="Focșani">
<text>Focșani (; ) is the capital city of Vrancea County in Romania on the banks the river Milcov, in the historical region of Moldavia. , it has a population of 66,719.

==Geography==
Focșani lies at the foot of the Curvature Carpathians, at a point of convergence for tectonic geologic faults, which raises the risk of earthquakes in the vicinity. Though Vrancea County is one of the most popular wine-producing regions in Romania, Odobești being just to the northwest, in Romania, Focșani itself is not considered a wine-producing center. The wine sold as &quot;Weisse von Fokshan&quot; in Germany and some other European countries is generally a &quot;Fetească Albă de Odobești&quot; wine, and practically a second-rated wine which does not comply to the European Union rules of naming the regions of origin of wines.

The vicinity is rich in minerals such as iron, copper, coal, and petroleum.

The city administers two villages, Mândrești-Moldova and Mândrești-Munteni.

Focșani lies within the strategically important Focșani Gate. In the 19th century, the Focșani–Nămoloasa–Galați line was built to defend this area more properly.

===Seismic hazard===
The territory of Vrancea County corresponds to the most seismically active zone of Romania.

The earthquakes with the epicenter in Vrancea are caused by the movements of the nearby fault blocks. Devastating earthquakes measuring 7 to 8 on the Richter scale have been recorded in 1738, 1802, 1838, 1940, 1977 and 1986.

==History==

As a town on the Moldavian-Wallachian border, Focșani developed into an important trade center halfway between the Russian Empire and the Balkans. A congress between Imperial Russian and Ottoman diplomats took place near the city in 1772. Near the town, the Ottomans suffered a severe defeat at the hands of the allied forces of the Habsburg monarchy under Prince Frederick Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and Imperial Russia under Alexander Suvorov in 1789 (&quot;see Battle of Focșani&quot;).

In the 1850s (after the Crimean War), Focșani grew in importance as the center of activities in favor of the union between Wallachia and Moldavia (the Danubian Principalities), leading up to the double election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza in Iași and Bucharest in 1859. From 1858, it housed a Central Commission regulating the common legislation of the two countries, as well as the High Court of Justice. Both institutions were disestablished in 1864, when the Romanian Principality was founded as a unified state. Focșani&#x27;s role in the forming of the modern Romanian state is immortalized in the Union Square Obelisk. It was suggested that Focșani become the capital of the United Principalities in 1861, as a desire to establish a more strategically located capital and represent both Wallachia and Moldavia as a compromise.

On 30–31 December 1881, following the impact of Zionism on the Romanian Jewish community, the First Congress of all Zionist Unions in Romania for the promotion of the return to Eretz Israel was held at Focșani. It was attended by 51 delegates, representing 32 organizations, two press editors, three newspaper reporters and important guests. This 1881 Congress, the first ever held, 16 years before the World Zionist Organization&#x27;s First Zionist (held in Basel), had a major influence on the Romanian Jews, and its proceedings also became known outside the borders of Romania.

In 1917, during the Romanian Campaign of World War I, Focșani and Galați were part of a line of fortifications known as the &quot;Siret Line&quot;. The Armistice of Focșani was signed in the city on 9 December 1917, between the Kingdom of Romania and the Central Powers.

In 1944, during World War II, Focșani was supposed to be part of the fortified Focșani–Nămoloasa–Galați line, where 9 elite divisions were preparing to resist the Soviet Red Army&#x27;s advance after the Battle of Târgu Frumos. However, due to the coup d&#x27;état on 23 August 1944 (&quot;see Romania during World War II&quot;), this never materialized.

==Demographics==

As of 2011 census data, Focșani has a population of 73,868, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census, making it the 27th largest city in Romania.

According to the census from 2002, there were 101,854 people living within the city of Focșani. The ethnic makeup was as follows:

* Romanians: 98.68%
* Roma: 1.07%
* Hungarians: 0.05%
* Other: 0.2%

==Coat of arms==

Focșani&#x27;s location on the Milcov (the river that divided Wallachia and Moldavia) inspired the design of its coat of arms, which depicts the handshake of two women personifying both principalities as a symbol of the union, with the motto &quot;Unirea face puterea&quot; (&quot;Unity makes strength&quot;).

<doc id="344670" wikidata="Q17146716" url="?curid=344670" title="Organic lawn management">
<text>Organic lawn management or organic turf management or organic land care or organic landscaping is the practice of establishing and caring for an athletic turf field or garden lawn and landscape using organic horticulture, without the use of manufactured inputs such as synthetic pesticides or artificial fertilizers. It is a component of organic land care and organic sustainable landscaping which adapt the principles and methods of sustainable gardening and organic farming to the care of lawns and gardens.

==Techniques==

A primary element of organic lawn management is the use of compost and compost tea to reduce the need for fertilization and to encourage healthy soil that enables turf to resist pests. A second element is mowing tall (3&quot; – 4&quot;) to suppress weeds and encourage deep grass roots, and leaving grass clippings and leaves on the lawn as fertilizer.

Additional techniques include fertilizing in the fall, not the spring. Organic lawns often benefit from over seeding, slice seeding and aeration more frequently due to the importance of a strong root system. Well-maintained organic lawns are often drought-tolerant. If a lawn does need watering it should be done infrequently but deeply.

Other organic techniques for caring for a lawn include irrigation only when the lawn shows signs of drought stress and then watering deeply – minimizing needless water consumption. Using low volume sprinklers provides more penetration without runoff. Lawnmowers with a mulching function can useful in reducing fertilizer use by allowing grass clippings and leaves that are cut so minutely that they can settle into the grass inconspicuously to decompose into the soil.

=== Clover lawns ===
Grass seed mixes used to contain white clover, which provides natural fertilizer, but this practice fell out of favor with the rise of synthetic fertilizer and businesses profiting from the sale of this fertilizer. In recent years, homeowners have returned to the use of clover as a natural fertilization source for lawns. In 2022, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported on the growing popularity of clover lawns. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported &quot;#cloverlawn has over 65 million views on TikTok.&quot;

=== Organic pesticides ===
Organic land managers may use registered pesticides approved under the National Organic Program in their lawn care programs. These pesticides are generally derived from natural materials and are minimally-processed. Alternatives include the use of beneficial insects and natural predators such as nematodes to prevent infestation of lawns with pests such as crane fly larvae and ants. Pesticides are allowed under the NOFA Standards for organic land care but not always used in organic lawn care because proper cultural practices can keep pest populations below action thresholds, such as preventing fungal infections using physical maintenance techniques such as effective mowing and raking.

===Organic fertilizers===
Synthetic (inorganic based) fertilizers are made in chemical processes, some of which use fossil fuels and contribute to global warming. They also greatly increase the amount of nitrogen entering the global nitrogen cycle which has a serious negative impact on the organization and functioning of the world&#x27;s ecosystems, including accelerating the loss of biological diversity and decline of coastal marine ecosystems and fisheries. Nitrogen fertilizer releases N2O, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere after application. Organic fertilizer nitrogen content is typically lower than synthetic fertilizer.

Organic lawns contribute to biodiversity, by definition, when they contain more than one or two grass species. Examples of additional lawn and grasslike species that can be encouraged in organic lawns include dozens of grass species (eight for ryegrass alone, sedges, mosses, clover, vetches, trefoils, yarrow, ground cover alternatives, and other mowable plants). Biodiversity increases the functioning and stress tolerance of ecosystems. Lack of biodiversity is a significant environmental issue brought up by the use of lawns with grassroots groups emerging to promote this method of lawn care. Certain low-growing grass species can also eliminate the need for mowing, thus also being environmentally friendly. Clover is often mixed with grasses for its ability to fix nitrogen into the soil and fertilize the lawn.

== No Mow May ==
No Mow May is a campaign to encourage homeowners to not mow their lawns during the month of May to support pollinators, native plants and wildlife diversity. The campaign was started in 2019 by Plantlife, a nature conservation charity based in the United Kingdom. In 2020, the city of Appleton, Wisconsin stopped mowing for the month of May. In 2022, cities around the United States participated in No Mow May. The campaign is supported by the Xerces Society through its Bee City USA program, and has described the movement as a &quot;gateway&quot; to creating better habitat for bees when adapted to local conditions and including native wildflowers.

== Locations with organic lawns &amp; pesticide ordinances ==
Many small properties with lawns around the world are maintained using organic techniques. In the late 20th century, a movement to manage lawns organically began to grow. Some large properties and municipalities require organic lawn management and organic landscaping and have enacted pesticide ordinances. Locations with organic lawn management plans or pesticide ordinances include:

=== Ryton Organic Gardens, Ryton-on-Dunsmore, Warwickshire, England ===

In 1985, the nonprofit Garden Organic, formerly known as the Henry Doubleday Research Association, relocated to its present site where it operates organic, landscaped grounds open to the public. The property is owned by Coventry University.

===Highgrove House estate, Gloucestershire, England===
In 1996, King Charles III, then the Prince of Wales, had transitioned the Highgrove House estate&#x27;s farm and gardens to organic management.

=== Painshill, Cobham, Surrey, England ===
In 1998, Painshill was awarded the Europa Nostra Medal for its restoration of the 18th century organic gardens originally designed by Charles Hamilton between 1738 and 1773 using what today are called organic methods.

=== Common Ground Education Center, Unity, Maine, United States ===
In 1998, the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association acquired the 300 acre property in Unity, Maine, and converted the land to organic demonstration fields, gardens, orchards, shade trees and low-impact forestry woodlots. It is the site of the annual Common Ground Country Fair, a fair showcasing organic food and farming.

=== Brooksvale Park, Hamden, Connecticut, United States ===
In 2003, Friends of Brooksvale Park formed to support the 500-acre park and implement environmental programming and initiatives, including organic practices and the Brooksvale Organic Garden, which produces vegetables for soup kitchens and food banks.

=== Vineyard Golf Club, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts, United States ===
In 2002, the Vineyard Golf Club opened on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard with the requirement that it use organic turf management. The first course superintendent, Jeff Carlson, was the recipient of the 2003 GCSAA/Golf Digest Environmental Leaders in Golf Award and is the 2008 winner of the President&#x27;s Award for Environmental Stewardship.

===Harvard University, Massachusetts, United States===

In 2009, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported on Harvard University&#x27;s decision to use organic management on all their grounds, which was championed by President Drew Gilpin Faust and implemented by landscape director Wayne Carbone. The New York Times noted: &quot;Thanks to these efforts, the university has reduced the use of irrigation by 30 percent, according to Mr. Carbone, thus saving two million gallons of water a year. And the 40-year-old orchards at Elmwood, which have been treated with compost tea, are recovering from leaf spot and apple scab, two ailments that had afflicted them.&quot;

=== High Line, Manhattan, New York, United States ===

In 2009, the first section of the organically-managed 1.45 mile linear park the High Line opened on the former New York Central Railroad, an elevated train line spur, on the west side of Manhattan in New York City. The High Line&#x27;s design is a collaboration between James Corner Field Operations, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and Piet Oudolf.

===Takoma Park, Maryland, United States===
Residents Catherine Cummings and Julie Taddeo began a campaign in 2011 to restrict lawncare pesticide use in Takoma Park, Maryland. City council members Seth Grimes and Tim Male quickly got behind the effort and drafted Takoma Park&#x27;s Safe Grow Act of 2013, leading to the city council&#x27;s enactment of the law, which went into effect March 1, 2014.

===Ogunquit, Maine, United States===
In 2014, Bill and Judy Baker and other residents convinced the Ogunquit Town Council to pass a strict pesticide ban requiring organic land care on both public and private property.

===Montgomery County, Maryland, United States===

In 2015, Julie Taddeo and Catherine Cummings and Safe Grow Montgomery colleagues campaigned to get Montgomery County, Maryland to adopt a pesticide ban that required organic lawn management throughout the county on both public and private property. Montgomery County Council President George Leventhal (D-at-large) wrote and introduced Bill 52-14, based on Takoma Park&#x27;s 2013 legislation. The county council enacted Bill 52-14 that October. The ban was challenged in court by local lawn care companies and pesticide industry lobbying group Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment (RISE). In 2017, the ban was overturned by a Circuit Court, and the ruling was appealed. In 2019, a Maryland appeals court upheld the ban.
===Irvine, California, United States===
In 2016, Non Toxic Irvine, a group led by citizens Laurie Thompson, Ayn Craciun, Kathleen Hallal, Kim Konte and Bob Johnson with help from City Councilor Christina Shea convinced the City Council to adopt an organic integrated pest management program requiring organic land care on all city property.

===Carlsbad, California, United States===
In 2017, Non Toxic Carlsbad campaigned to get the city to adopt an ordinance requiring organic land care on all city property.

===Portland, Maine, United States===
In 2018, Portland Protectors led by Avery Yale Kamila and Maggie Knowles convinced the Portland City Council to adopt an organic ordinance requiring organic land care on all public and private property.

===Dover, New Hampshire, United States=== 
In 2018, the Dover City Council unanimously approved a resolution calling for a &quot;Commitment to Organic Land Management Practices&quot; brought to the Council by resident group Non Toxic Dover, NH and sponsored by Councilor Dennis Shanahan. The City began an all-organic turf program for City property in 2020.

===Gardens of Vatican City, Rome, Italy ===
In 2019, Rafael Tornini, head of the Garden and Environment Service of the Vatican, announced the 37 acre Gardens of Vatican City had been transitioning to organic management since 2017.
=== Delta Dental Stadium, Manchester, New Hampshire, United States ===
In 2019, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats began the transition to make Delta Dental Stadium the first professional baseball field that is organically managed. Stonyfield, as part of its #playfree campaign to convert recreational spaces to organic management, supported the field&#x27;s transition.

===New York City public lands, United States===
In 2021, the New York City Council banned the use of synthetic pesticides by city agencies. The effort was started by teacher Paula Rogovin&#x27;s kindergarten class at P.S. 290.

=== Maui, Hawaii, United States ===
In 2021, the island of Maui banned synthetic pesticides and fertilizers from all county lands. Community organizers including Autumn Ness, director of Beyond Pesticides&#x27; Hawai&#x27;i Organic Land Management Program worked to enact the law.

=== Baltimore, Maryland, United States ===
In 2022, a synthetic pesticide ban on public and private property passed by the Baltimore City Council in 2020 went into effect. It includes a fine of up to $250 for violators.

=== Hallowell, Maine, United States ===
In 2024, a synthetic pesticide ban on public and private property went into effect in Hallowell, which is located along the Kennebec River.

<text>Apocynaceae (, from &quot;Apocynum&quot;, Greek for &quot;dog-away&quot;) is a family of flowering plants that includes trees, shrubs, herbs, stem succulents, and vines, commonly known as the dogbane family, because some taxa were used as dog poison. Members of the family are native to the European, Asian, African, Australian, and American tropics or subtropics, with some temperate members. The former family Asclepiadaceae (now known as Asclepiadoideae) is considered a subfamily of Apocynaceae and contains 348 genera. A list of Apocynaceae genera may be found here.

Many species are tall trees found in tropical forests, but some grow in tropical dry (xeric) environments. Also perennial herbs from temperate zones occur. Many of these plants have milky latex, and many species are poisonous if ingested, the family being rich in genera containing alkaloids and cardiac glycosides, those containing the latter often finding use as arrow poisons. Some genera of Apocynaceae, such as &quot;Adenium&quot;, bleed clear sap without latex when damaged, and others, such as &quot;Pachypodium&quot;, have milky latex apart from their sap.

==Description==
===Growth pattern===
The dogbane/milkweed family includes annual plants, perennial herbs, stem succulents, woody shrubs, trees, or vines. Most exude a milky latex when cut.

===Leaves and stems===
Leaves are simple. They may appear one at a time (singly) with each occurrence on alternating sides of the stem, but usually occur in pairs (and rarely in whorls). When paired, they occur on opposite sides of the stem (opposite), with each pair occurring at an angle rotated 90° to the pair below it (decussate).

There is no stipule (a small leaf-like structure at the base of the leaf stem), or stipules are small and sometimes finger-like.

===Inflorescence and fruit===
Flowers have radial symmetry (actinomorphic), and are borne in heads that are cymes or racemes, or are solitary in axils. They are perfect (bisexual), with a synsepalous, five-lobed calyx united into a tube at the base. Inflorescences are terminal or axillary. Five petals are united into a tube with four or five epipetalous stamens. The style head is swollen. The pollen is transported in foam. The ovary is usually superior, &quot;bicarpellary,&quot; and &quot;apocarpous,&quot; with a common fused style and stigma. (Fig. 5. and Fig.6. in the illustration of &quot;Rhigospira quadrangularis&quot; show a typical tripartite style which divides into three zones (specialised for pollen deposition, viscin secretion, and the reception of pollen).

The fruit is a drupe, a berry, a capsule, or a (frequently paired) follicle. The seeds are often winged or have appendages of long silky hairs.

==Taxonomy==

As of 2012, the family was described as comprising some 5,100 species, in five subfamilies: 
* Apocynoideae Burnett, 1835
* Asclepiadoideae Burnett, 1835 (incorporating the Asclepiadaceae)
* Periplocoideae Endl., 1838
* Rauvolfioideae Kostel., 1834
* Secamonoideae Endl., 1838

The former family Asclepiadaceae is included in Apocynaceae according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III (APG III) modern, largely molecular-based system of flowering plant taxonomy.
An updated classification, including 366 genera, 25 tribes, and 49 subtribes, was published in 2014.

376 genera are currently accepted.

==Distribution and habitat==

Species in this family are distributed mainly in tropical regions: 
*In the tropical forests and swamps of Indomalaya: small to very tall evergreen trees up to tall, often with buttress roots, such as &quot;Alstonia&quot; and &quot;Dyera.&quot;
*In Australia: occurs in all habitats; about 46 genera and about 200 species, including about 20 naturalised; herbs, vines, shrubs and trees.
*In deciduous forests of Africa, India, and Indo-China: smaller trees such as &quot;Carissa&quot;, &quot;Wrightia,&quot; and &quot;Holarrhena&quot;
*In tropical America, India, Myanmar, and Malaya: evergreen trees and shrubs, such as &quot;Rauvolfia&quot;, &quot;Tabernaemontana,&quot; and &quot;Acokanthera.&quot;
*In Central America: &quot;Plumeria&quot;, or the frangipani, with its waxy white or pink flowers and a sweet scent.
*In South America, Africa, and Madagascar: many lianas, such as &quot;Landolphia&quot;
*In the Mediterranean region: &quot;Nerium&quot;, with the well-known oleander or be-still tree (&quot;Nerium oleander&quot;), and Apple of Sodom (&quot;Calotropis procera&quot;), with other (&quot;Calotropis&quot;) species extending into South Asia.
*The only genera found in temperate Europe away from the Mediterranean are &quot;Vinca&quot; (Rauvolfioideae) and &quot;Vincetoxicum&quot; (Asclepiadoideae). Also &quot;Asclepias syriaca&quot; is an invasive weed (e. g., in many areas of Ukraine).
*In North America: &quot;Apocynum&quot;, dogbane or Indian hemp, including &quot;Apocynum cannabinum&quot;, a traditional source of fiber. Also the bluestars, &quot;Amsonia&quot;, herbaceous perennials of upright habit, grown as ornamental plants for their attractive flowers.
*In continental southern Africa (Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Mozambique, South Africa, and Zimbabwe) and Madagascar, except for the humid evergreen forest of the eastern side of Madagascar, and never above for the entire island: &quot;Pachypodium&quot; and &quot;Fockea.&quot;

==Ecology==
Several genera are preferred larval host plants for the Queen Butterfly (&quot;Danaus gilippus&quot;).

==Toxicity==
Many species of plants from the family Apocynaceae have some toxicity, with some being extremely poisonous if parts are ingested, or if they are not handled properly. Genera containing cardiac glycosides—&quot;Cerbera&quot;, &quot;Nerium&quot;, &quot;Asclepias&quot;, &quot;Cascabela&quot;, &quot;Strophanthus,&quot; &quot;Acokanthera&quot;, &quot;Apocynum,&quot; &quot;Thevetia,&quot; etc.—have therapeutic ranges, but are often associated with accidental poisonings, in many cases lethal (see below). Alkaloid-producing species like &quot;Rauvolfia serpentina,&quot; &quot;Catharanthus roseus,&quot; and &quot;Tabernanthe iboga&quot; are likewise the source of compounds with therapeutic ranges, but which have significant associated toxicities if not taken in appropriate doses and in controlled fashion. (See below)

==Uses==
Several members of the family Apocynaceae have had economic uses in the past. Several are sources of important natural products—pharmacologic tool compounds and drug research candidates, and in some cases actual prescription drugs. Cardiac glycosides, which affect heart function, are a ready example. Genera studied and known to contain such glycosides include &quot;Acokanthera&quot;, &quot;Apocynum&quot;, &quot;Cerbera&quot;, &quot;Nerium&quot;, &quot;Thevetia&quot; and &quot;Strophanthus.&quot; &quot;Rauvolfia serpentina&quot; (Indian snakeroot) contains the alkaloid reserpine, which has been used as an antihypertensive and an antipsychotic drug but its adverse effects limit its clinical use. &quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot; yields alkaloids used in the treatment of cancer. &quot;Tabernanthe iboga, Voacanga africana, and Tabernaemontana undulata&quot; contain the alkaloid ibogaine, which is a psychedelic drug which may help with drug addiction, but which has significant adverse effects, with ibogaine being both cardiotoxic and neurotoxic. Ajmalicine, an alkaloid found in &quot;Rauvolfia&quot; spp., &quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot;, and &quot;Mitragyna speciosa&quot;, is an antihypertensive drug used in the treatment of high blood pressure.

Many genera are grown as ornamental plants, including &quot;Amsonia&quot; (bluestar), &quot;Nerium&quot; (oleander), &quot;Vinca&quot; (periwinkle), &quot;Carissa&quot; (Natal plum), &quot;Allamanda&quot; (golden trumpet), &quot;Plumeria&quot; (frangipani), &quot;Thevetia&quot;, &quot;Mandevilla&quot; (Savannah flower), and &quot;Adenium&quot; (desert-rose).

In addition, the genera &quot;Landolphia&quot;, &quot;Carpodinus&quot;, and &quot;Mascarenhasia&quot; have been used as commercial sources of inferior rubber. (See Congo rubber)

There are limited dietary uses of plants from this family. The flower of &quot;Echites panduratus&quot; (common name: &quot;&quot;) is edible. &quot;Carissa&quot; (Natal plum) produces an edible fruit, but all other parts of the plant are poisonous. The genus &quot;Apocynum&quot; was reportedly used as a source of fiber by Native Americans. The aromatic fruit juice from &quot;Saba comorensis&quot; (syn. &quot;Landolphia comorensis&quot;, the Bungo or Mbungo fruit) is used as a drink.

Finally, ethnopharmacologic and ethnotoxicologic uses are also known. The roots of &quot;Tabernanthe iboga&quot; and certain &quot;Voacanga&quot; species have traditionally been used ceremonially as hallucinogens in Africa. The ibogaine-type alkaloids responsible for the psychoactivity of these plants have been studied with regard to the treatment of drug addiction. The juice of &quot;Acokanthera&quot; species such as &quot;A. venenata&quot; and the milky juice of the Namibian &quot;Pachypodium&quot; have been used as poison for arrow tips.

Many species are ornamental in gardens or as houseplants.

<text>Michael Jan de Goeje (August 13, 1836 – May 17, 1909) was a Dutch orientalist focusing on Arabia and Islam.

==Early life==
Michael Jan de Goeje was born in Dronrijp, Friesland. He devoted himself at an early age to the study of oriental languages and became especially proficient in Arabic, under the guidance of Reinhart Dozy and Theodor Juynboll, to whom he was afterwards an intimate friend and colleague. He took his degree of doctor at Leiden in 1860, and then studied for a year in Oxford, where he examined and collated the Bodleian manuscripts of al-Idrisi (part being published in 1866, in collaboration with Dozy, as &quot;Description de l&#x27;Afrique et de l&#x27;Espagne&quot;). About the same time he wrote &quot;Mémoires de l&#x27;histoire et de la géographie orientales&quot;, and edited &quot;Expugnatio regionum&quot;. In 1883, on the death of Dozy, he became Arabic professor at Leiden, retiring in 1906.

==Career==
Though perhaps not a teacher of the first order, he wielded great influence during his long tenure of the chair not only over his pupils, but over theologians and eastern administrators who attended his lectures. His many editions of Arabic texts are of the highest value to scholars; the most important being his great edition of Tabari. Though highly averse to politics, he took a keen interest in the municipal affairs of Leiden and made a special study of elementary education. He took the leading part in the International Congress of Orientalists at Algiers in 1905. He was a member of the Institut de France, was awarded the German Order of Merit, and received an honorary doctorate of Cambridge University. At his death he was president of the newly formed International Association of Academies of Science. He became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1869.

==Bibliography==
Among his chief works are:

*&quot;Fragmenta historicorum Arabicorum&quot; (1869-1871) Fragmenta historicorum arabicorum Volume 1 Volume 2 Fragmenta historicorum arabicorum Fragmenta historicorum arabicorum
*&quot;Diwan of Moslim ibn al-Wâlid&quot; (1875)

*An edition of Ibn Qutaiba&#x27;s biographies (1904)

He was also the chief editor of the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; (vols. i.-iii.), and contributed many articles to periodicals. He wrote for the 9th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica.

==Commemoration==
De Goeje&#x27;s name is preserved in that of the Stichting de Goeje which subsidises the publication of academic studies relating to the Middle East.
