<text>Manisha Koirala (; born 16 August 1970) is a Nepalese actress who works in Indian films, predominantly in Hindi and Tamil. Born to the politically prominent Koirala family, she is the daughter of Prakash Koirala and the granddaughter of Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala. One of the most popular and highest-paid actresses of her time, she is the recipient of several accolades, including three Filmfare Awards, one Filmfare Awards South and one Filmfare OTT Awards . In 2001, the Government of Nepal awarded her with the Order of Gorkha Dakshina Bahu.

Koirala made her acting debut with the Nepali film &quot;Pheri Bhetaula&quot; (1989), and later debuted in Indian cinema with the Hindi drama &quot;Saudagar&quot; (1991). Following a brief setback, she established herself with commercial successes in both Bollywood and Kollywood films, including &quot;Bombay&quot; (1995), &quot;Agni Sakshi&quot; (1996), &quot;Indian&quot; (1996), &quot;&quot; (1997), &quot;Kachche Dhaage&quot; (1999), &quot;Mudhalvan&quot; (1999) and &quot;Company&quot; (2002). She also received critical recognition for playing a naive girl in &quot;1942: A Love Story&quot; (1994), an ambitious wife in &quot;Akele Hum Akele Tum&quot; (1995), the daughter of deaf-mute parents in &quot;&quot; (1996), a terrorist in &quot;Dil Se..&quot; (1998) and a mistreated woman in &quot;Lajja&quot; (2001). 

Over the course of the next decade, she garnered praise for her performances in several unconventional and art-house films, such as the survival drama &quot;Escape From Taliban&quot; (2003), the Malayalam psychological drama &quot;Elektra&quot; (2010), and the anthology film &quot;I Am&quot; (2010). In 2012, Koirala took a break from acting after being diagnosed with last stage ovarian cancer and underwent an year-long treatment, making a successful recovery by mid-2014. She returned with the coming-of-age drama &quot;Dear Maya&quot; (2017), followed by her portrayal of actress Nargis in &quot;Sanju&quot; (2018). The same year Koirala featured in the Netflix production &quot;Lust Stories&quot;. She has since starred in the acclaimed period drama series &quot;&quot; (2024).

In addition to acting in films, Koirala was appointed as the Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Population Fund in 1999 for India and 2015 for Nepal, and was involved in the relief works after the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. She also contributed as an author to the novel &quot;Healed: How Cancer Gave Me a New Life&quot;; which is an account of her struggle with ovarian cancer. Koirala is frequently cited as one of the most beautiful actresses of her times.

== Early Life ==

Manisha Koirala was born on 16 August 1970 into the politically prominent Koirala family, in Biratnagar, Nepal. Her father, Prakash Koirala, is a politician, former Cabinet minister and a former member of Nepal’s House of Representatives, while her mother, Sushma Koirala, is a homemaker. 

Koirala has one brother, Siddharth Koirala, who is a former Bollywood actor. Several members of her family went on to become politicians; her grandfather, Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala, was the Prime Minister of Nepal during the late 1950s to the early 1960s, as were two of her great-uncles, Girija Prasad Koirala and Matrika Prasad Koirala. 

Koirala spent her early life in India, and she stayed in Varanasi at her maternal grandmother&#x27;s home for some years and later in Delhi and Mumbai. While at home in Varanasi, she attended the Vasant Kanya Mahavidyalaya until Class X. Aspiring to become a doctor, she moved to Delhi and studied at the Army Public School (APS) of the Dhaula Kuan, New Delhi campus. In an interview, she said that living on her own in Delhi helped her become &quot;strong and independent.&quot; Determined to pursue a career in acting, Koirala later moved to Mumbai for film roles.

==Career==
===1989–1993: Debut and initial work ===

During a break after her class X board exams, Koirala acted in the 1989 Nepali film &quot;Pheri Bhetaula&quot; as an experiment. She also took on a few modeling assignments during her time in Delhi, but later shifted her focus toward acting. One of these was for a wool company. 

In 1991, Koirala made her Hindi film debut with Subhash Ghai&#x27;s directorial &quot;Saudagar&quot;, which emerged as a commercial success. According to Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com, &quot;[C]ritics saw sparks in Manisha, even as she was constantly referred to as Madhuri Dixit&#x27;s lookalike&quot;. &quot;Yalgaar&quot; (1992), did well at the box-office and was classified as a hit. However, this was trailed by a series of films that performed poorly at the box office, including &quot;First Love Letter&quot; (1991), &quot;Anmol&quot; and &quot;Dhanwan&quot; (both 1993), which led to Koirala being labeled &quot;a jinx&quot; by producers.

===1994–1999: Breakthrough, critical acclaim and established actress ===

Koirala&#x27;s career prospects improved after starring in Vidhu Vinod Chopra&#x27;s romance film &quot;1942: A Love Story&quot; (1994), set during the Indian independence movement. She played Rajjo, the daughter of a freedom fighter who falls in love with Naren (Anil Kapoor), the apolitical son of a British colonial employee. Chopra dismissed Koirala as a &quot;terrible actress&quot; after her first screen test, but was impressed with her performance for a second audition and decided to cast her in place of Madhuri Dixit. The film featured the protagonists sharing a deep kiss; it was certified U/A (Parental guidance required) by the Central Board of Film Certification, becoming the first Indian film to receive the rating. Koirala&#x27;s performance received positive reviews, with critics hailing her as &quot;a sensitive performer&quot;. The film proved to be a box office flop. However, it fetched Koirala her first nomination for Best Actress at the annual Filmfare Awards ceremony.

In 1995, Koirala made her debut in Tamil cinema with the Mani Ratnam-directed political romance &quot;Bombay&quot;, starring alongside Arvind Swami. She took up the role on the insistence of her friend Ashok Mehta, at a time when other contemporaries urged her to not act in non Hindi film industries. It received critical acclaim, with American critic James Berardinelli writing, &quot;&quot;Bombay&quot; recalls how forceful a motion picture can be. It also reminds us of the maxim that those who don&#x27;t learn from history are doomed to repeat it&quot;. For playing a Muslim who marries a Hindu journalist against the backdrop of the Bombay riots in the eponymous film. At the 43rd Filmfare Awards South, she received her first Award in the Best Actress – Tamil category. Koirala&#x27;s performances in &quot;1942: A Love Story&quot; and &quot;Bombay&quot; proved to be milestones in her career, and established her in the film industry. The same year, she featured in the musical romance &quot;Akele Hum Akele Tum&quot; opposite Aamir Khan a remake of 1979 American film &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, and received her second nomination in the Best Actress category at the Filmfare Awards.

The following year, she played a battered wife on the run from her mentally-ill husband in the drama &quot;Agni Sakshi&quot;, a remake of the Julia Roberts-starrer &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot; (1991), which begot her positive reviews for her performance. The film was released in close succession with two other remakes of the same film –&quot;Yaraana&quot; (1995) and &quot;Daraar&quot; (1996) and was a commercial success, emerging as the second highest-grossing film of the year in India. Koirala next featured opposite Salman Khan in the comedy &quot;Majhdhaar&quot; the same year, which was both a critical and commercial failure. She then played a starring role in S. Shankar&#x27;s &quot;Indian&quot; (1996), which marked her second Tamil film. It was also dubbed and released in Hindi under the title &quot;Hindustani&quot;. Featuring Kamal Haasan in dual roles alongside Koirala, Urmila Matondkar and Sukanya, it was the most expensive Indian film at that time, with a budget of 150 million. Both &quot;Indian&quot; and &quot;Hindustani&quot; were commercial successes. 

In her last release of 1996, she acted in the musical drama &quot;&quot;, which marked Sanjay Leela Bhansali&#x27;s directorial debut. Koirala played Annie, a caring daughter to her deaf-mute parents Joseph and Flavy, portrayed by Nana Patekar and Seema Biswas respectively; Salman Khan played Raj, her love interest. In preparation for her role, Koirala learned the Indian Sign Language. A critic from Channel 4 wrote, &quot;Koirala in particular is in her element and demonstrates the full range of her acting ability, rather than playing against it as she has had to do in more traditional films&quot;. Despite receiving critical acclaim, &quot;Khamoshi: The Musical&quot; was a flop. &quot;Filmfare&quot; included her performance among a list of &quot;80 Iconic Performances&quot; of Indian cinema in 2011. In a box office roundup of the year, &quot;The Indian Express&quot; felt Koirala put up an &quot;impressive show&quot; with her successes. Her performance in &quot;Khamoshi&quot; earned her a second Filmfare Award for Best Performance and a nomination for Best Actress. She also received her only win for Best Actress at the Screen Awards.

In 1997, she played the leading role alongside Kajol and Bobby Deol in the thriller &quot;&quot;, which was one of the biggest hits that year but her other films in the year were unsuccessful. The next year, she went on to collaborate once again with the acclaimed director Mani Ratnam, and starred in his film &quot;Dil Se..&quot; (1998) opposite Shah Rukh Khan. Her role received similarly good reviews and earned her several award nominations including the Filmfare Best Actress Award nomination. The film proved to be a hit overseas. The film became the first Indian film to enter the top 10 in the United Kingdom box office charts. Even months after its release in September 1998, the film was still screened on five screens, five times per day with an average of 3,000 spectators across all screens in the Cineworld complex in Feltham, West London. Koirala later played the leading role opposite to Govinda in the movie &quot;Maharaja&quot;.

In 1999, she starred in the successful &quot;Kachche Dhaage&quot;, which was followed by six more releases, the most notable of them being Indra Kumar&#x27;s drama &quot;Mann&quot;, remake of 1957 Hollywood classic &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot;, which entered into the top five highest-grossing films of the year. Her performance in the film won her favourable reviews. Film critic M. Ali Ikram wrote about her performance: &quot;If there is a respite for Manisha&#x27;s innumerable fans of late, this flick is it. We may not care about hits and flops, but it is painful to watch this acting virtuoso in the innumerable side roles she has been seen in of late. Indra Kumar&#x27;s decision to cast Manisha here is a case of perfect casting, and she never lets him or the audience down. This lady is truly the Meena Kumari of her generation. It is great fun watching Manisha and Aamir Khan&#x27;s perfect chemistry opposite one another. The film&#x27;s climax has both stars permanently molding a spot for themselves in Bollywood history, and it will have you shedding tears by the bucketful.&quot; It was a successful feature at the box office. While filming &quot;Laawaris&quot; (1999), Koirala began to get tired of her busy schedule and felt &quot;the pressure getting to [her]&quot;; she turned to alcohol for solace and developed anger issues. She also reunited with  S.Shankar  for &quot;Mudhalvan&quot; (1999) which went on to become one of the highest grossers of Tamil Nadu that year.

===2000–2007: Transition to art-house cinema and career fluctuations===

In 2000, Koirala starred in four films including action dramas &quot;Baaghi&quot; and &quot;Champion&quot;, but none of the films became major successes. The same year, she debuted on television and hosted the reality game show titled &quot;Sawaal Dus Crore Ka&quot; on Zee TV alongside Anupam Kher. Both anchors were later replaced due to poor performance of the show. Koirala was extremely hurt and upset for being made the scapegoat and blamed the poor production quality on the sets.

In 2001, she starred in the drama &quot;Grahan&quot; opposite Jackie Shroff. Her portrayal of a rape victim in the film who seeks justice was appreciated, but the film, which was a much-delayed project, was a major commercial failure. After starring in moderately successful &quot;Chhupa Rustam: A Musical Thriller&quot; she next played the protagonist in Rajkumar Santoshi&#x27;s drama &quot;Lajja&quot;, along with an ensemble cast that included Rekha, Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit. The film received a positive reception from critics, and so did Koirala&#x27;s performance. Her last release of the year was &quot;Moksha&quot;, opposite Arjun Rampal, which was a failure at the box office.

In 2002, she starred opposite Ajay Devgan in Ram Gopal Verma&#x27;s &quot;Company&quot;. The film was a critical success and she won her third Filmfare Critics&#x27; Best Actress Award. In that same year, she appeared in &quot;Ek Chotisi Love Story&quot;. The film, when released, generated tremendous response at the box office, becoming one of the few successes of the year. The movie&#x27;s release was stayed as she accused the director of the film, Shashilal Nair, of using her body double to shoot some love scenes in the film, and portraying her in bad light by shooting positions using another actress in her place, without her approval. A court finally decided to stay the release of the film.

Koirala then ventured into strong woman-oriented films in 2003, such as &quot;Escape From Taliban&quot;, which won her the BFJA Award for Best Actress. She then played the protagonist in &quot;Market&quot;, a film portraying the whole life story of a young prostitute. The film did decently at the box office and was considered &#x27;average.&#x27; 

After receiving a diploma in filmmaking in New York, she produced the small-budget caper-comedy &quot;Paisa Vasool&quot; (2004). In 2005, she appeared in various unsuccessful films such as historical epic drama &quot;Taj Mahal: An Eternal Love Story&quot;, the thriller &quot;Tum - A Dangerous Obsession&quot;, and the horror film &quot;Anjaane – The Unknown&quot; and the black comedy &quot;Mumbai Express&quot;. Her only releases in 2006 and 2007 were &quot;Darwaaza Bandh Rakho&quot; and &quot;Anwar&quot; respectively, where she played supporting roles, working with her brother Siddharth in the latter.

===2008–2017: Comeback attempts and sporadic work===

In 2008, Koirala starred opposite Irrfan Khan in the family drama &quot;Tulsi&quot;, in her first leading role since &quot;Mumbai Express&quot; (2005). Before its release, her role was described by the media as a &quot;shocking comeback&quot; but the film suffered from poor marketing. Although Koirala&#x27;s performance as Tulsi, a young homemaker diagnosed with leukemia, was well received. Taran Adarsh from &quot;IndiaFM&quot; wrote: &quot;Manisha Koirala sinks her teeth in this role and delivers a fine performance.&quot; She next starred in &quot;Sirf&quot; (2008) which was a critical and box office failure. Her first Bengali film &quot;Khela&quot;, directed by Rituparno Ghosh, released the same year, along with the long delayed Hindi film &quot;Mehbooba&quot;; both films released on the same day. 

In 2009, Koirala starred in Deepti Naval&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Do Paise Ki Dhoop, Char Aane Ki Barish&quot; which premiered at the market section of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival to a positive response. Later that year, she acted in Partho Ghosh&#x27;s &quot;Ek Second... Jo Zindagi Badal De?&quot;.

In 2010, Koirala made her foray into Malayalam cinema with Shyamaprasad&#x27;s &quot;Elektra&quot;, a psycho-sensual drama based on Sophocles&#x27;s ancient Greek tragic play &quot;Electra&quot;. She plays the antagonist in the film, which revolves around the concept of the Electra complex, which is a daughter&#x27;s psychosexual competition with her mother for her father&#x27;s affection. The film premiered at the International Film Festival of India, where it was well received. She also acted in her native Nepali-language film, &quot;Dharmaa&quot;, after a gap of 22 years since her first film. She was next seen in director Onir&#x27;s critically acclaimed anthology film &quot;I Am&quot;, sharing the screen with Juhi Chawla. Noted film critic Taran Adarsh commented: &quot;It&#x27;s a delight to watch Juhi and Manisha, after a hiatus. Both deliver striking performances – even getting the language right.&quot; 

In 2011, Koirala appeared in &quot;Mappillai&quot;, marking her comeback to Tamil cinema after five years. A remake of the 1989 film of the same name, the film saw her reprising the role originally played by Srividya. Her performance earned her a nomination at the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress – Tamil and the film was declared a hit.

In 2012, she collaborated with director Ram Gopal Verma for his 3D horror film &quot;Bhoot Returns&quot;, a sequel to the 2003 hit &quot;Bhoot&quot;. It was deemed to be yet another comeback for Koirala, however she refused to call it a comeback because she had not been away from films for a long time. Despite the good initial response to its promos and trailers, the film turned out to be a critical and commercial failure. 

Three years later, in 2015, her much delayed psychological thriller &quot;&quot; released but went unnoticed. A year later, she silently returned with the Kannada-Tamil mystery film &quot;Game&quot; (2016) where she portrayed the main female lead. 

In 2017, Koirala made another Bollywood comeback attempt with the drama &quot;Dear Maya&quot;. Directed by Sunaina Bhatnagar and co-starring Madiha Imam, her role was of a middle-aged lonely woman who embarks on a journey to find love when she receives love letters. The film received mixed reviews from critics with praise directed to Koirala&#x27;s performance. Sweta Kaushal of &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; said: &quot;Manisha Koirala shines like a diamond in a coal mine.&quot; Suhani Singh from &quot;India Today&quot; noted that she is the &quot;star in this mawkish coming-of-age story&quot;, while Stutee Ghosh of &quot;The Quint&quot; wrote that &quot;Manisha Koirala&#x27;s grace makes it worth a watch.&quot;

=== 2018–present: Streaming projects ===

In 2018, Koirala featured in one of the segments directed by Dibakar Banerjee in the Netflix anthology &quot;Lust Stories&quot;, where she played a middle-aged housewife, having an extra-marital affair with her husband&#x27;s best friend. The film was nominated for International Emmy Award for Best TV Movie or Miniseries, and Koirala&#x27;s performance was also appreciated. This was followed by an appearance in Rajkumar Hirani&#x27;s biography &quot;Sanju&quot;, based on the life of actor Sanjay Dutt; Koirala portrayed the role of actress Nargis, Dutt&#x27;s mother. The film emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year. 

In 2019, Koirala featured in &quot;Prasthanam&quot; Hindi remake of the political thriller with &quot;the same title&quot;, in which she played Sanjay Dutt&#x27;s wife. Her much delayed film &quot;Do Paise Ki Dhoop, Chaar Aane Ki Baarish&quot; also released on Netflix this year. It was followed by the Netflix original &quot;Maska&quot; in 2020, directed by Neeraj Udhwani.

In 2021, she appeared in AR Rahman&#x27;s romantic musical &quot;99 Songs&quot;. She then starred in an American comedy film &quot;India Sweets and Spices&quot;, directed by Geeta Malik.

In 2023, she appeared in the action-drama &quot;Shehzada&quot;. Her performance was appreciated, although the film was a commercial failure.

In 2024, Koirala played the chief courtesan Mallikajaan in Sanjay Leela Bhansali&#x27;s series &quot;Heeramandi&quot;. Nandini Ramnath of &quot;Scroll.in&quot; noted, &quot;Manisha Koirala, sporting a deep voice and her nastiest manner, gives a near-parodic role her best shot. But she is hard-pressed to portray Mallikajaan’s campy tendencies.&quot; She won a Filmfare OTT award for Best Actor, Series (Female): Drama for the role.

<doc id="355385" wikidata="Q729505" url="?curid=355385" title="Soft Machine">
<text>Soft Machine are an English rock band from Canterbury, Kent. The band were formed in 1966 by Mike Ratledge, Robert Wyatt, Kevin Ayers, Daevid Allen and Larry Nowlin. Soft Machine were central in the Canterbury scene; they became one of the first British psychedelic acts, and later moved into progressive and jazz rock. In 1971, Soft Machine became a purely instrumental band. Soft Machine&#x27;s lineup has undergone many changes, and has included Andy Summers, Hugh Hopper, Elton Dean, John Marshall, Karl Jenkins, Roy Babbington and Allan Holdsworth. , the current line-up consists of John Etheridge, Theo Travis, Fred Thelonious Baker and Asaf Sirkis.

Though they achieved little commercial success, critics consider Soft Machine to have been influential in rock music. Dave Lynch at AllMusic called them &quot;one of the most influential underground bands of their era&quot;. The band&#x27;s name originates from William S. Burroughs&#x27;s novel &quot;The Soft Machine&quot;.
==History==
===Original run (1966–78)===
In mid 1966, Mike Ratledge (keyboards), Robert Wyatt (drums, vocals), Kevin Ayers (bass, vocals), Daevid Allen (guitar) and Larry Nowlin (guitar) formed Soft Machine, who were billed as The Soft Machine up to 1969 or 1970. Allen and Wyatt first played together in 1963 as part of the Daevid Allen Trio, and were occasionally accompanied by Ratledge. In 1964, Wyatt and Ayers were founding members of The Wilde Flowers; by 1966, they had both left that band and rejoined Allen to form the short-lived band Mister Head, which also included Nowlin. The four members soon joined with Ratledge to form The Soft Machine. Ayers suggested the band&#x27;s name, which comes from William S. Burroughs&#x27;s novel &quot;The Soft Machine&quot; (1961). The band became a quartet when Nowlin departed in September 1966.

During late 1966 and early 1967, Soft Machine became involved in the early UK underground scene. Along with Pink Floyd, they became one of the major resident bands at the UFO Club, and played other London clubs like the Speakeasy and Middle Earth. According to Wyatt, The Soft Machine received negative reactions when playing at venues other than these underground clubs; this led to their penchant for long tracks and segued tunes because continuously playing deprived their audiences chances to boo them. In February 1967, the band released their first single &quot;Love Makes Sweet Music&quot; on Polydor Records.

In April 1967, The Soft Machine recorded nine demo songs with producer Giorgio Gomelsky in De Lane Lea Studios; due to a dispute over studio costs, these tracks were unreleased for several years. Polydor later released these demos in 1972 as &quot;Jet Propelled Photographs&quot;. Later in 1967, the band began touring in mainland Europe, becoming especially popular in France. When returning from a tour of France in August, Allen, an Australian, was denied re-entry to the UK, so the group continued as a trio while Allen returned to Paris to form Gong.

The Soft Machine, who shared the same management as The Jimi Hendrix Experience, supported them on two North American tours during 1968. The band signed to Probe Records and recorded their eponymous first album in New York City in April at the end of the first tour, though it was not released until December. In London, guitarist Andy Summers, later of The Police, joined The Soft Machine. The band&#x27;s new line-up began a US tour with some headlining shows before supporting Hendrix in August and September 1968. By the time the Hendrix tour began, Summers had been fired at Ayers&#x27; insistence. Ayers himself departed amicably after the final tour date at the Hollywood Bowl in September, and Soft Machine disbanded. Wyatt stayed in the US to record solo demos while Ratledge returned to London and began composing.

In December 1968, to fulfil contractual obligations, Wyatt and Ratledge re-formed The Soft Machine with their former road manager Hugh Hopper replacing Ayers on bass. Hopper, like Ayers and Wyatt, was a founding member of The Wilde Flowers. In 1969, The Soft Machine recorded their second album &quot;Volume Two&quot; , which started a change to jazz fusion. The album fulfilled the band&#x27;s contract with Probe and they signed with CBS Records by the beginning of 1970. In May 1969, The Soft Machine played as the uncredited backing band on two tracks of &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot;, the debut solo album of Pink Floyd&#x27;s Syd Barrett. Shortly after the Barrett recording, Hopper&#x27;s brother Brian Hopper, another Wilde Flowers co-founder, joined The Soft Machine on saxophone. Around this time, the band recorded the soundtrack for a multimedia show called &quot;Spaced&quot;, which ran in London for five days in mid 1969. The soundtrack was commercially released in 1996 by Cuneiform Records. In October 1969, following Brian Hopper&#x27;s departure, The Soft Machine expanded to a septet; Wyatt, Ratledge and Hugh Hopper added a four-piece horn section composed of the saxophonists Elton Dean and Lyn Dobson, cornet player Mark Charig and trombonist Nick Evans. After two months, Charig and Evans departed the band.

The quintet continued until March 1970, when Dobson departed. The remaining quartet recorded the double album &quot;Third&quot; (1970) and its single-album follow-up &quot;Fourth&quot; (1971). &quot;Third&quot; was mostly instrumental save for Wyatt&#x27;s song &quot;Moon in June&quot;, the last Soft Machine song to have lyrics. &quot;Third&quot; is unusual for its time in having each of the four sides feature one suite. &quot;Third&quot; has since become Soft Machine&#x27;s biggest-selling album. From &quot;Fourth&quot; onwards, the band became completely instrumental on record, and then on stage following Wyatt&#x27;s departure soon after the album&#x27;s release. During this period, the band received unprecedented acclaim across Europe, and they became the first rock band to be invited to play in August 1970 at London&#x27;s Proms concert, and the show was broadcast live on UK national television.

After differences over the group&#x27;s musical direction, Wyatt was fired in August 1971 and formed Matching Mole (a pun on &quot;machine molle&quot;, French for &quot;soft machine&quot;; also said at the time to have been taken from stage lighting equipment &quot;Matching Mole&quot;). He was briefly replaced by Australian drummer Phil Howard. This line-up toured extensively in Europe during late 1971 and began the recording of their next album &quot;Fifth&quot;, but further musical disagreements led to Howard&#x27;s dismissal at the beginning of 1972, with the album being completed with his replacement, John Marshall. &quot;Fifth&quot; was released in 1972, with side one comprising tracks recorded with Howard and side two comprising tracks recorded with Marshall. Later that year, Dean left the band and was replaced by Karl Jenkins, who also played keyboards in addition to saxophone. Both Marshall and Jenkins were former members of Ian Carr&#x27;s Nucleus. The band&#x27;s next album was a half-live half-studio double album &quot;Six&quot;, released in early 1973.

After the release of &quot;Six&quot;, Hopper left the band and was replaced by Roy Babbington, another former Nucleus member. During this period, Jenkins began to take over as bandleader and main composer. After they released &quot;Seven&quot; in late 1973, Soft Machine again switched record labels from CBS to Harvest Records, a sub-label of EMI Records. At the end of 1973, another former Nucleus member Allan Holdsworth was added to the band, becoming their first guitarist since Andy Summers&#x27; brief tenure in 1968. Holdsworth played on the next album &quot;Bundles&quot; (1975) before leaving in early 1975. Holdsworth&#x27;s replacement was John Etheridge, and the saxophonist Alan Wakeman, a cousin of Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman, also joined at the beginning of 1976. The next album, &quot;Softs&quot; (1976), was the first without Ratledge, the last-remaining original member of the band, who left in March 1976. Other members of Soft Machine during the late 1970s were the saxophonist Ray Warleigh, the violinist Ric Sanders, and the bassists Percy Jones of Brand X and Steve Cook. During 1977, Soft Machine recorded the live album &quot;Alive &amp; Well: Recorded in Paris&quot;, which was released early the following year. In 1978, Soft Machine gave only one live performance, which was at the Sound &amp; Musik Festival in Dortmund, West Germany, on 8 December, with a line-up of Marshall, Jenkins, Cook and Holdsworth. After this show, Soft Machine disbanded.

===Occasional reunions (1980–81; 1984)===
The name Soft Machine was resurrected for the 1981 album &quot;Land of Cockayne&quot;. Soft Machine also briefly reformed for a series of concerts at London&#x27;s Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in mid 1984 that featured John Marshall, Karl Jenkins, Ray Warleigh, John Etheridge, bassist Paul Carmichael and pianist Dave MacRae.

===Alternative bands (1978–2015)===

====Soft Heap / Soft Head (1978–88)====
Soft Heap was formed in January 1978 by Hugh Hopper and Elton Dean from Soft Machine, and Alan Gowen and Pip Pyle from National Health. is an acronym that is composed of the initials of the members&#x27; first names. The band toured in the early-to-mid 1978 as Soft Head because Dave Sheen replaced Pip Pyle due to Pyle&#x27;s commitments to National Health. The live album &quot;Rogue Element&quot; was recorded on that tour and was released in 1978.

The original Soft Heap line-up reformed in October 1978 to record their eponymous studio album, which was released in 1979.

After two line-up changes from 1979 to 1981, the new line-up intermittently toured throughout the 1980s; they performed four tours during the decade in 25 European concerts, culminating on 11 May 1988 at the festival &quot;Jazz sous les pommiers&quot; in Coutances, France.

====Soft Ware (1999), Soft Works (2002–04), Soft Mountain (2003) and Soft Bounds (2004)====
Soft Ware (sometimes SoftWhere), which was formed in September 1999, was composed of Elton Dean, Hugh Hopper, John Marshall on drums and Marshall&#x27;s long-time friend Keith Tippett. This short-lived line-up played one performance at (Augustusburg Hunting Lodge, Germany, on 4 September 1999. In 2002, with Tippett unavailable, another former Soft Machine member Allan Holdsworth (on guitar) joined the other three members of Soft Ware, who in June2002 renamed themselves Soft Works to avoid confusion with Peter Mergener&#x27;s band Software. Soft Works made their live debut on 17 August 2002 at the Progman Cometh Festival at Moore Theater in Seattle, Washington; and a live album of the performance was released on 29 July 2003. Their only studio album &quot;Abracadabra&quot;, consisting of new material and recorded at Eastcote Studios, London, on 5–7 June 2002. The album was toured in Japan in August 2003, Italy in January and February 2004, and Mexico in March 2004.

During a Japanese Soft Works tour in August 2003, Elton Dean on saxophone and Hugh Hopper on bass formed the band Soft Mountain along with Japanese musicians Hoppy Kamiyama on keyboards, whom Hopper had met two years earlier, and Yoshida Tatsuya from the band Ruins on drums. Soft Mountain named themselves after Hoppy Kamiyama, whose name translates as &quot;God Mountain&quot;. Looking for a break from relatively fixed set lists and song forms, Hugh Hopper had contacted Kamiyama with the idea of using a studio for one day to see what might happen. Kamiyama brought in Tatsuya, and, with no discussion, the quartet played two 45-minute improvisations. In 2007, a year after Elton Dean died aged 60, Soft Mountain released the eponymous album they had recorded on 10 August 2003 in Tokyo, Japan. The two-part &quot;Soft Mountain Suite&quot; extracts the best thirty minutes from each improvisation.

In June 2004, Elton Dean and Hugh Hopper formed the band Soft Bounds with Sophia Domancich on keyboards and Simon Goubert on drums); they played at the Festival &quot;Les Tritonales&quot; in Les Lilas, Paris, France. This concert was partially released in 2005 as the Soft Bounds&#x27; album &quot;Live at Le Triton&quot;.

====Soft Machine Legacy (2004–15)====
In October 2004, the members of Soft Works, with John Etheridge permanently replacing Holdsworth, took the name &quot;Soft Machine Legacy&quot; and performed two festival shows; one on 9 October in Turkey and the other on 15 October in the Czech Republic. Liam Genockey temporarily replaced John Marshall who had ligament problems. The new band&#x27;s line-up was Elton Dean, John Etheridge, Hugh Hopper and Liam Genockey. Soft Machine Legacy released three albums: &quot;Live in Zaandam&quot; (2205), the studio album &quot;Soft Machine Legacy&quot; (2006), which was recorded in September 2005 and features fresh material, and &quot;Live at the New Morning&quot; (2006). After Elton Dean died in February 2006, the band continued with the British saxophonist and flautist Theo Travis, formerly of Gong and The Tangent.

In December 2006, the new Legacy line-up recorded the album &quot;Steam&quot; in Jon Hiseman&#x27;s studio. &quot;Steam&quot; was released in August 2007 by Moonjune Records before a European tour. Hopper left the band in 2008 because he was suffering from leukaemia, so for live performances Fred Thelonious Baker deputising for Hopper. Following Hopper&#x27;s death in 2009, the band announced they would continue with Roy Babbington again replacing Hopper on bass.

Soft Machine Legacy released their fifth album in October 2010; the 58-minute record &quot;Live Adventures&quot; was recorded live in October 2009 in Austria and Germany during a European tour. Founding Soft Machine bassist Kevin Ayers died in February 2013 at aged 68, and 77-year-old Daevid Allen died in March 2015 following a short battle with cancer. On 18 March 2013, the Legacy band released a new studio album titled &quot;Burden of Proof&quot;. Travis stated: &quot;legally we could actually be called Soft Machine but for various reasons it was decided to be one step removed&quot;.

=== A return to the name &quot;Soft Machine&quot; (2015–present) ===
In September and October 2015, it was announced Soft Machine Legacy, which was composed of drummer John Marshall, guitarist John Etheridge, bassist Roy Babbington, and sax, flute and keyboard player Theo Travis, would be performing under the name Soft Machine in late 2015 and early 2016: they would perform two shows in the Netherlands and Belgium in early December 2015, and seven UK shows in March and April 2016. In December 2015, it was confirmed the band were dropping the word &quot;Legacy&quot; from their name, becoming known as Soft Machine for the first time since 1984.

The former Soft Machine member Allan Holdsworth, aged 70, died from heart failure on 15 April 2017 at his home in Vista, California. On 7 September 2018, Soft Machine released &quot;Hidden Details&quot; on Dyad Records in the UK and Tonefloat Records in the US, their first new studio album since &quot;Land of Cockayne&quot; (1981). In late 2018 and until February 2019, they toured the world to mark their 50th anniversary and to support the new album.

On 20 March 2020, Soft Machine released &quot;Live at The Baked Potato&quot;, their first original live album since &quot;Alive &amp; Well&quot; (1978). It was recorded live on 1 February 2019 at The Baked Potato, Los Angeles, and was initially only available as a twelve-track limited-edition double vinyl LP of 200 copies but it has since been released on Compact Disc (CD). The album documents their extensive 2018–2019 world tour. On 7 December 2021, Soft Machine announced Babbington was retiring from the band and would be replaced by Fred Thelonious Baker.

In June 2023, Soft Machine released the new studio album &quot;Other Doors&quot;, which was recorded with John Marshall before he retired from music. Marshall died on 16 September 2023. , the line-up of Soft Machine was Etheridge, Travis, Baker and drummer Asaf Sirkis. They embarked on a seven-date UK tour beginning on 3 February 2023 at the New Cross Inn in London and ending on 26 May 2023 at City Varieties in Leeds. The band began touring again in November 2023 with dates booked until November 2024.

Co-founding member Mike Ratledge died on 5 February 2025.

==Style==
Soft Machine&#x27;s music encompasses progressive rock, experimental rock, jazz rock, jazz, proto-prog, psychedelic rock and art rock. The band are part of the Canterbury scene of progressive rock. According to Hugh Hopper: &quot;We weren&#x27;t consciously playing jazz rock, it was more a case of not wanting to sound like other bands; we certainly didn&#x27;t want a guitarist&quot;.

<text>Grover Cleveland Alexander (February 26, 1887 – November 4, 1950), nicknamed &quot;Old Pete&quot; and &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball pitcher. He played from 1911 through 1930 for the Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, and St. Louis Cardinals. In 1938, Alexander was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Alexander was born in Elba, Nebraska One of eight children born to William Alexander and Martha &quot;Maggie&quot; Cootey. His father was a Democrat, and Alexander was born during the first term of President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, so his parents named him for Cleveland. Alexander attended the schools of Elba and St. Paul, and graduated from St. Paul High School in 1909. After completing his education, Alexander was employed digging postholes for the Howard County Telephone Company.

Alexander played semi-professional baseball in his youth, signing his first professional contract at age 20 in 1907 for $50 per month ($ in current dollar terms). In 1909, he played for the Galesburg Boosters in the Class D Illinois–Missouri League and went 15–8 that year with a 1.36 ERA. His career was almost ended when he was struck by a thrown ball while baserunning. Although this ended his 1909 season, he recovered by 1910 to become a star pitcher again, finishing with a 29–11 record for the Syracuse Stars in the Class B New York State League, before being sold to the Philadelphia Phillies for $750 ($ in current dollar terms).

==Major League Baseball career==
=== Philadelphia Phillies ===
Alexander made his Philadelphia Phillies debut during the pre-season 1911 City Series, pitching five innings of no-hit, no-run baseball against the Athletics. He made his official Major League debut on April 15. He was joined on the Phillies that year by catcher Bill Killefer, who went on to become Alexander&#x27;s favorite battery mate, catching 250 of his games.

In his rookie year, Alexander led the league with 28 wins (a modern-day rookie record), 31 complete games, 367 innings pitched, and seven shutouts, while finishing second in strikeouts and fourth in ERA. From 1912 to 1921, Alexander led the league in ERA four times (1915–16, 1919, and 1920), wins five times (1914–17, 1920), innings six times (1912, 1914–17, 1920), strikeouts six times (1912, 1914–1917, 1920), complete games five times (1914–1917, 1920), and shutouts five times (1915, 1916 [a single-season record 16], 1917, 1919, 1921). He won the National League pitching Triple Crown in 1915, 1916, and 1920, and is sometimes credited with a fourth in 1917. In 1915, he was instrumental in leading the Phillies to their first pennant, pitching a record five one-hitters and winning his only Major League triple crown. Along the way, Alexander began to have problems with alcohol, a struggle that would plague him the rest of his life. In 1915, he won his first World Series game (the opening game of that series), for the Phillies. It would be 65 years before the Phillies won another World Series game.

=== Chicago Cubs ===
After the 1917 season, the Phillies traded Alexander and catcher Bill Killefer to the Cubs for catcher Pickles Dillhoefer, pitcher Mike Prendergast, and $55,000. Phillies owner William Baker later admitted, &quot;I needed the money.&quot;

After the United States entered World War I, Alexander was drafted into the Army, and one month before shipping out, he married Aimee Marie Arrant on May 31 in a courthouse ceremony in Manhattan, Kansas (the couple divorced in 1929, remarried in 1931, and divorced again in 1941).

Alexander spent most of the season in France as a sergeant with the 342nd Field Artillery Regiment, 89th Division. While he was serving in France, he was exposed to German mustard gas and a shell exploded near him, causing partial hearing loss and triggering the onset of epilepsy. Alexander returned to the United States in April 1919 on the SS Rochambeau. Following his return from the war, Alexander suffered from shell shock and was plagued with epileptic seizures, which people often misinterpreted as a sign of drunkenness; this only exacerbated his drinking problem.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
In spite of all this, Alexander gave Chicago several successful years and won another pitching triple crown in 1920. Tiring of his increasing drunkenness and insubordination that was often directly related to his epilepsy, the Cubs sold him to the Cardinals in the middle of the 1926 season for the waiver price. The Cubs manager, Joe McCarthy, supposedly said that even with Alexander, the Cubs had finished last the previous season, &quot;...and if they finished last again, I&#x27;d rather it was without him.&quot;

The Cardinals won the National League pennant that year and met the New York Yankees in the World Series, where Alexander pitched complete game victories in Games 2 and 6. According to teammate Bob O&#x27;Farrell in &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;, after the game six victory, Alexander got drunk that night and was still feeling the effects when he was sent out to pitch the next day in Game 7. Alexander came into the game in the seventh inning after starter Jesse Haines developed a blister, with the Cardinals ahead 3–2, the bases loaded and two out. Facing Yankee slugger Tony Lazzeri, Alexander struck him out and then held the Yankees scoreless for two more innings to preserve the win and give St. Louis the championship. The final out of the 7th game was made when Babe Ruth tried to steal second base.

===Return to Phillies===
He had one last 20-win season for the Cardinals in 1927, but his continued drinking ended his career. After a brief return to the Phillies in 1930, he left the major leagues.

Alexander&#x27;s 90 shutouts are a National League record and his 373 wins are tied with Christy Mathewson for first in the National League record book. He is also tied for third all time in wins, tenth in innings pitched (5190), second in shutouts, and eighth in hits allowed (4868). At the time of Alexander&#x27;s final victory in August 1929, the news media reported that he had broken Mathewson&#x27;s career victories record of 372. In the 1940s, Mathewson was discovered to have qualified for an additional victory (May 21, 1912) and his total was officially upped to 373 and into a tie with Alexander. Alexander posted a lifetime winning percentage of , compared to Mathewson&#x27;s .665. Alexander has the most career wins of any pitcher who never threw a no-hitter.

Alexander was a good fielding pitcher for his era, committing only 25 errors in 1,633 total chances for a career .985 fielding percentage. As a hitter, he accumulated 378 hits in 1,810 at-bats for a .209 batting average with 11 home runs, 163 runs batted in, 154 runs and 77 bases on balls in a 20-year career.

==Later life and legacy==

During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Alexander continued to play baseball, touring as a player-coach for the Grover Cleveland Alexander&#x27;s House of David Team. The team&#x27;s tour was managed by J. L. Wilkinson and often played against the Kansas City Monarchs. Alexander played with and against many of the Negro league stars of the day, including Satchel Paige, John Donaldson, Newt Joseph, Chet Brewer, and Andy Cooper. After the end of prohibition, Alexander operated a tavern in St. Louis with Hughie Miller as his partner.

Alexander was elected to Baseball&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1938, the third year of the Hall. Alexander was the only player elected that year.

Alexander attended Game 3 of the 1950 World Series at Yankee Stadium, where he saw the Phillies lose to the Yankees. He died less than a month later, on November 4 in St. Paul, Nebraska, at the age of 63. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in St Paul.

Alexander was the subject of the 1952 biographical film &quot;The Winning Team&quot;, portrayed by Ronald Reagan, giving Alexander the unique distinction of being named for one U.S. president and being portrayed by another. The film earned an estimated $1.7 million at the North American box office in 1952.

In 1999, he ranked number 12 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Since he played before the Phillies adopted uniform numbers, the block-letter &quot;P&quot; from the 1915 season uniforms was retired by the team in 2001 to honor his career with them.

Alexander is the first player mentioned in the poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash:
==Nicknames==
Newspapers often mentioned Alexander&#x27;s full name when writing about him, in addition to just &quot;Grover&quot;. He was also sometimes called &quot;Alec&quot;, and on occasions when he succeeded in grand fashion (as with the 1926 World Series), they would call him &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;. He was so dominant during the 1910s that many players and writers of his era referred to him as &quot;the best pitcher to ever put on a pair of shoes&quot;.

The nickname of &quot;Old Pete&quot; began as &quot;Alkali Pete&quot;, which was in itself a pastiche, based on a series of early silent film westerns based on characters named Alkali Ike and Mustang Pete. While on a hunting trip with Bill Killefer in Texas, Alexander&#x27;s dusty appearance prompted Killefer to name him &quot;Alkali Pete&quot; and it stuck. Before going to war, he was given a watch engraved with the nickname, dating its origin to no later than 1918. By the late 1920s, it had morphed into &quot;Old Pete.&quot;

It is uncertain how frequently Alexander was publicly called by that nickname during his playing days. When he won his 373rd game on August 10, 1929, one newspaper had called him &quot;old Pete&quot;, indicating that the nickname was in public circulation. On his 1940 Playball baseball card he was referred to as &quot;Ol&#x27; Pete.&quot; In &quot;The World Series and Highlights of Baseball&quot;, by Lamont Buchanan, published in 1951, the year after Alexander died, on pages 106–107 the author refers to &quot;Pete Alexander&quot; and &quot;Ol&#x27; Pete&quot; in a matter-of-fact way, suggesting the nickname was well known.

The Baseball-Reference.com website lists him as Grover Alexander with a name note and an AKA as Pete Alexander.

His nickname among family friends in Nebraska was &quot;Dode&quot;.

<text>Bart Berman (; born 29 December 1938) is a Dutch-Israeli pianist and composer, best known as an interpreter of Franz Schubert and 20th-century music.

== Career ==
Bart Berman studied piano with Jaap Spaanderman at a predecessor of the Conservatorium van Amsterdam and complemented his piano education with Theo Bruins and a master class by Alfred Brendel. In 1978 he moved to Israel.

As a soloist Berman was awarded the Dutch Prize of Excellence, the first prize in the Gaudeamus Competition for interpreters of contemporary music, the Friends of the Concertgebouw Award and four first prizes at competitions for young soloists. He has performed in Israel, Europe and the United States, as a soloist and in chamber music. Berman was a soloist with many Dutch and Israeli orchestras and has recorded for radio and television.

Collaborations included those with flautist Abbie de Quant (since 1970), Duo 4 with pianist Meir Wiesel, the Tamar Piano Trio with violinist Itzhak Segev and cellist Louis Rowen, as well as ensembles with several vocalists among whom Bat-Sheva Zeisler. Past partnerships include Duo Beer Sheva with the late pianist Sara Fuxon, Ensemble M, and Negev Baroque. From 2004 until 2008 Berman accompanied the remake of Hanoch Levin&#x27;s satirical cabaret &quot;You, Me and the Next War&quot;, in 2007 he was the pianist and musical director of &quot;Schubert Plus, An Operatic Episode in Two Acts&quot;, and during 2011 to 2015 he was a guest soloist with the Zamir Quartet. In 2014 he launched a new program for 4 pianists at 2 pianos, based on Duo 4.

Berman taught piano at the conservatoires of Rotterdam and Arnhem and was an editor of the Israel Music Institute. Among his many students are Cleem Determeijer, Kees van Eersel, Margriet Ehlen, Dror Elimelech, Gerard Houtman, and Matthijs Verschoor.

Berman studied composition with Bertus van Lier and Wouter van den Berg. He has composed many original works, including cadenzas to all piano concerti by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven and second piano parts to be played alongside original compositions by Muzio Clementi and Daniel Steibelt.

<text>Solomon Feferman (December 13, 1928July 26, 2016) was an American philosopher and mathematician who worked in mathematical logic. In addition to his prolific technical work in proof theory, computability theory, and set theory, he was known for his contributions to the history of logic (for instance, via biographical writings on figures such as Kurt Gödel, Alfred Tarski, and Jean van Heijenoort) and as a vocal proponent of the philosophy of mathematics known as predicativism, notably from an anti-platonist stance.

==Life==
Solomon Feferman was born in The Bronx in New York City to working-class parents who had immigrated to the United States after World War I and had met and married in New York. Neither parent had any advanced education. The family moved to Los Angeles, where Feferman graduated from high school at age 16.

He received his B.S. from the California Institute of Technology in 1948, and in 1957 his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley, under Alfred Tarski, after having been drafted and having served in the U.S. Army from 1953 to 1955. In 1956 he was appointed to the Departments of Mathematics and Philosophy at Stanford University, where he later became the Patrick Suppes Professor of Humanities and Sciences. While the majority of his career was spent at Stanford, he also spent time as a post-doctoral fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, a visiting professor at MIT, and a visiting fellow at the University of Oxford (Wolfson College and All Souls College). 

Feferman died on 26 July 2016 at his home in Stanford, following an illness that lasted three months and a stroke. At his death, he had been a member of the Mathematical Association of America for 37 years.

==Contributions==
Feferman was editor-in-chief of the five-volume &quot;Collected Works&quot; of Kurt Gödel, published by Oxford University Press between 2001 and 2013.

In 2004, together with his wife Anita Burdman Feferman, he published a biography of Alfred Tarski: &quot;Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic&quot;.

Influenced by the writings of Hermann Weyl, he worked on predicative mathematics. In particular, he introduced the Feferman–Schütte ordinal as a measure of the strength of certain predicative systems.

==Recognition==
Feferman was awarded Guggenheim Fellowships in 1972 and 1986 and the Rolf Schock Prize in logic and philosophy in 2003. He was invited to give the Gödel Lecture in 1997 and the Tarski Lectures in 2006. In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

<doc id="355407" wikidata="Q78858" url="?curid=355407" title="Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky">
<text>Margarete &quot;Grete&quot; Schütte-Lihotzky ( Lihotzky; 23 January 1897 – 18 January 2000) was an Austrian architect and a communist activist in the Austrian resistance to Nazism. She is mostly remembered today for designing what is known as the Frankfurt kitchen.

== Early life and education ==
Margarete Lihotzky was born on 23 January 1897 into a bourgeois family in Margareten, since 1850 part of Vienna. Her grandfather Gustav Lihotzky was a mayor of Czernowitz, Ducal Bukovina, and her mother Julie Bode was relative of Wilhelm von Bode. Her father was a liberal-minded civil servant, Erwin Lihotzky, whose pacifism made him welcome the end of the Habsburg Empire and the founding of the republic in 1918. Lihotzky became the first female student at the &quot;Kunstgewerbeschule&quot;, today the University of Applied Arts Vienna), where renowned artists such as Josef Hoffmann, Anton Hanak, and Oskar Kokoschka taught. Lihotzky almost did not get in. Her mother persuaded a close friend to ask the famous artist Gustav Klimt for a letter of recommendation. In 1997, celebrating her 100th birthday and reminiscing about her decision to study architecture, she remarked that &quot;in 1916 no one would have conceived of a woman being commissioned to build a house – not even myself.&quot;

Lihotzky studied architecture under Oskar Strnad, winning prizes for her designs even before her graduation. Strnad was one of the pioneers of &quot;sozialer Wohnbau&quot; in Vienna, affordable yet comfortable social housing for the working classes. Inspired by him, Lihotzky understood that connecting design to functionality was the new trend that would be in demand in the future. After graduating, among her other projects, she collaborated with Adolf Loos, planning settlements for World War I invalids and veterans. During this time she also worked alongside architect Josef Frank and philosopher Otto Neurath in the context of the newly founded Austrian Settlement and Allotment Garden Association where she developed core houses. Her memories of these and many other Austrian architects and intellectuals are collected in her book &quot;Warum ich Architektin wurde&quot; (&#x27;Why I Became an Architect&#x27;).

== Housing design==
In 1926 she was called to the &quot;Hochbauamt&quot; of the City Council of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, by the architect and city planner Ernst May where she worked on the New Frankfurt project. May had been given the political power and financial resources to solve Frankfurt&#x27;s housing shortage. He and Schütte-Lihotzky, together with the rest of May&#x27;s assembled architectural staff, successfully brought functional clarity and humanitarian values to thousands of the city&#x27;s housing units.

Lihotzky continued her work by designing kindergartens, students&#x27; homes, schools and similar community buildings. Schütte-Lihotzky designed kindergarten pavilions based on the ideas of Maria Montessori. In Frankfurt she met colleague Wilhelm Schütte, whom she married the following year.

=== Frankfurt Kitchen ===

As part of the New Frankfurt-project Lihotzky created the Frankfurt Kitchen in 1926, which was the prototype of the built-in kitchen now prevalent in the Western world. Based on scientific research by U.S. management expert Frederick Winslow Taylor and her own research, Lihotzky used a railroad dining car kitchen as her model to design a &quot;housewife&#x27;s laboratory&quot; using a minimum of space but offering a maximum of comfort and equipment. The kitchen measured just 1.9 x 3.4 meters. Kitchen surfaces were painted blue-green as scientists claimed the color repelled flies. The Frankfurt City Council eventually installed 10,000 of her mass-produced, prefabricated kitchens in newly-built working-class apartments.

On her 100th birthday Schütte-Lihotzky commented &quot;You&#x27;ll be surprised that, before I conceived the Frankfurt Kitchen in 1926, I never cooked myself. At home in Vienna my mother cooked, in Frankfurt I went to the &quot;Wirthaus&quot; [restaurant-pub]. I designed the kitchen as an architect, not as a housewife.&quot;

In September 2024, in central Vienna, a 1970s version of the Frankfurt kitchen, restored by architect Renate Allmayer-Beck on the basis of Schütte-Lihotzky&#x27;s original plans and photos, was opened to the public. 

== Wartime activities ==
As the political situation in the Weimar Republic deteriorated and shifted to the political right, Schütte-Lihotzky joined a team of seventeen architects, the &quot;May Brigade&quot;, led by architect Ernst May and including her husband and Erich Mauthner, also from Vienna. In 1930 they travelled to Moscow by train. There the group was commissioned to help realize the first of Stalin&#x27;s five-year plans by building the industrial city of Magnitogorsk in the southern Ural Mountains. On their arrival, the city consisted of mud huts and barracks. It was to have 200,000 inhabitants in a few years&#x27; time, the majority the populace working in the steel industry. Although the May Brigade was credited with the construction of 20 cities in three years, political conditions were bad and the results mixed. May left Russia in 1933 when his contract was up.

With the exception of brief business trips and lecture tours to Japan and China, Schütte-Lihotzky remained in the Soviet Union until 1937. She and her husband moved first to London and later to Paris. Also, in 1933 Schütte-Lihotzky had presented some of her work at the Chicago world&#x27;s fair, &quot;Century of Progress&quot;.

In 1938 Schütte-Lihotzky, together with her husband, was called to Istanbul, Turkey, to teach at the Academy of Fine Arts, and to reunite with exiled German architect Bruno Taut. (Unfortunately Taut died soon after their arrival.) On the eve of World War II Istanbul was a haven for exiled Europeans, a common destination for exiled Germans, and the Schüttes encountered artists such as the musicians Béla Bartók and Paul Hindemith.

In Istanbul Schütte-Lihotzky met fellow Austrian Herbert Eichholzer, an architect who at the time was busy organizing Communist resistance to the Nazi regime. In 1939 Schütte-Lihotzky joined the Austrian Communist Party (KPÖ) and in December 1940, of her own free will, together with Eichholzer, travelled back to Vienna to secretly contact the Austrian communist resistance movement. Schütte-Lihotzky agreed to meet a leading Resistance member nicknamed &quot;Gerber&quot;, Erwin Puschmann, and help set up a communications line with Istanbul. She met &quot;Gerber&quot; at the Cafe Viktoria on 22 January 1941, where they were surprised and arrested by the Gestapo, only 25 days after her arrival. While Eichholzer and other resistance fighters, who had also been seized, were charged with high treason, sentenced to death by the &quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot; and executed in 1943, Schütte-Lihotzky was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment and taken to a prison in Aichach, Bavaria. She was liberated by U.S. troops on 29 April 1945.

== Post-war ==

In 1945, after the war had ended, she moved to Sofia, Bulgaria, where she came up with the Kindergarten System, a modular architectural system of plans she designed for the municipality. Positing that the advancement of women would benefit society at large, she wrote of her Kindergarten System in Sofia, &quot;The growing percentage of the Bulgarian women in production and in all sectors of the public life of the country will make the establishment of children’s institutions increasingly important in the coming years.&quot; It was also during this time that she was able to reunite with her husband, Wilhelm Schütte, after being imprisoned for more than four years for her participation in the Communist Resistance against the Nazi regime. 

Margarete Schütte-Lihotsky eventually returned to her native Vienna in 1947. Her strong political views – she remained a communist – prevented her from receiving any major public commissions in post-war Austria, despite the fact that innumerable buildings had been destroyed and had to be rebuilt (&quot;Wiederaufbau&quot;). Consequently, apart from designing some private homes, Schütte-Lihotzky worked as a consultant in China, Cuba, and the German Democratic Republic. In 1951 she separated from her husband, Wilhelm Schütte.

Belatedly, her accomplishments were officially recognized in Austria. She was first recognised for her non-architecture activities: in 1977 she received a medal for her peace work and, in 1978, an honour badge for her work in the Resistance. She received the Architecture Award from the City of Vienna in 1980. In 1985 she published her memoirs, &quot;Erinnerungen aus dem Widerstand&quot; (&#x27;Memories From the Resistance&#x27;). She refused to be honoured in 1988 by Austrian Federal President Kurt Waldheim on the grounds of Waldheim&#x27;s dubious wartime record. She eventually received the award in 1992. In 1995 she was one of a group of Austrian Holocaust survivors who sued Jörg Haider after a debate in the Austrian parliament on bomb attacks on Romanies in which Haider referred to Nazi concentration camps as &quot;prison camps&quot;.

In 1990 a scale model of the Frankfurt Kitchen was put on display in the Austrian Museum for Applied Art in Vienna.

She celebrated her 100th birthday in 1997, dancing a short waltz with the Mayor of Vienna and remarking, &quot;I would have enjoyed it, for a change, to design a house for a rich man.&quot;

Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky died in Vienna, on 18 January 2000, at the age of 102, five days before her 103rd birthday, of complications after contracting influenza. She was interred in the Vienna Central Cemetery.

== Commemoration ==
The Australian singer, writer, and director Robyn Archer wrote a play based on Schütte-Lihotzky&#x27;s life. &quot;Architektin&quot;, featuring Helen Morse, Ksenja Logos, Craig Behenna, Duncan Graham, Antje Guenther, Michael Habib and Nick Pelomis, produced by the State Theatre Company of South Australia, and directed by Adam Cook, opened on 2 September 2008 at the Dunstan Playhouse, Adelaide, South Australia. The song &quot;The Frankfurt Kitchen&quot; by Rotifer is another tribute to her work.

Schütte-Lihotzky was celebrated in an exhibition &quot;Cumhuriyet Kadınları Sahneye Çıkıyor: Cevval, Akılcı, Dirençli, Sabırlı ve İnançlı&quot;, (Republican Women Take to the Stage: Brave, Rational, Resistant, Patient and Faithful) organised at Goethe-Institut Ankara from 5 December 2023 to 4 February 2024 in honour of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Turkey and the 90th anniversary of Turkish women gaining the right to vote. It showcased the lives and careers of six women who were educated in the young Turkish Republic and the Weimar Republic and whose careers made an impact on the world. Alongside Schütte-Lihotzky, the exhibition featured archaeologist Halet Çambel, architect Mualla Eyüboğlu Anhegger, Semiha Berksoy, Turkey&#x27;s first Muslim opera singer, paediatrician Erna Eckstein Schlossmann and computer scientist Marianne Laqueur.

<text>The Iron Crown (in Italian, Latin, and Lombard: &quot;Corona Ferrea&quot;; ) is a reliquary votive crown, traditionally considered one of the oldest royal insignia of Christendom. It was made in the Middle Ages, consisting of a circlet of gold and jewels fitted around a central silver band, which tradition held to be made of iron beaten out of a nail of the True Cross. In the later Middle Ages, the crown came to be seen as a heritage from the Kingdom of the Lombards and was used as regalia for the coronation of some Holy Roman Emperors as kings of Italy. It is kept in the Duomo of Monza.

==Description==
The Iron Crown is so called because it contains a one-centimetre-wide band within it that is said to have been beaten out of a nail used at the crucifixion of Jesus. The outer circlet of the crown is made of six segments of beaten gold, partly enamelled, joined together by hinges. It is set with 22 gemstones that stand out in relief, in the form of crosses and flowers. Its small size and hinged construction have suggested to some that it was originally a large armlet or, most probably, a votive crown. According to early modern scholars such as Bartolomeo Zucchi and Ludovico Antonio Muratori, the small size is due to a readjustment after the loss of two segments.

==Legend==
According to tradition, St. Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, had the crown forged for her son around a beaten nail from the True Cross, which she had discovered. Pope Gregory the Great passed this crown to Theodelinda, princess of the Lombards, as a diplomatic gift, although he made no mention of it among his recorded donations. Theodelinda donated the crown to the church at Monza in 628.

According to another tradition reported by the historian Valeriana Maspero, the helm and the bit of Constantine were brought to Milan by the emperor Theodosius I, who resided there, and were exposed at his funeral, as described by Ambrose in his funeral oration &quot;De obitu Theodosii&quot;. Then, as the bit remained in Milan (where it is currently preserved in the cathedral), the helm with the diadem was transferred to Constantinople, until Theoderic the Great, who had previously threatened Constantinople itself, claimed it as part of his right as the king of Italy. The Byzantines then sent him the diadem, holding the helmet (which was exposed in the cathedral of Hagia Sophia) until it was looted and lost following the sack of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade in 1204. King Theoderic then adopted the diadem &quot;gemmis insignitum, quas pretiosior ferro innexa(s)crucis redemptoris divinae gemma connecteretas&quot; (Ambrose, &quot;De obitu Theodosii&quot;) as his crown. This is the Iron Crown, passed by the Goths to the Lombards when they invaded Italy.

The crown was used in Charlemagne&#x27;s coronation as King of the Lombards in 774.

==History==
The crown was certainly in use for the coronation of the kings of Italy by the 14th century, and supposedly since at least the 11th. 

Old research dates the crown to the 8th or early 9th century. However, according to a more recent study, the crown in its current state is the result of two different works made between the 4–5th and the 9th century. This seems to validate the legends about the origin of the crown, that date it back to the Lombard era. In reality, the Lombard royalty ignored the coronation ceremonies. As for other Germanic populations, the ritual of accession was an acclamation by the armed people in the royal palace of Pavia, during which the sovereign received a lance as a symbol of his power.

Lord Twining cites a hypothesis by Reinhold N. Elze that Gisela, the daughter of the Emperor Louis the Pious who married Duke Eberhard of Friuli, may have originally possessed the crown and left it to her son Berengar I of Italy on her death in 874. Berengar was the only major benefactor of the church at Monza at this time and also gave the Cathedral of St. John in Monza a cross made in the same style as the Iron Crown, which is still preserved in the church&#x27;s treasury. The crown and cross may therefore have been made as a votive ornament. Twining also notes that the Imperial Museum at St. Petersburg includes in its collection two medieval crowns found at Kazan in 1730 made in the same style and of the same size as the Iron Crown. Twining notes that while these crowns and the Iron Crown are too small to be worn around an adult human head, they could be worn on the top of the head if they were affixed to a veil, and this would account for the small holes on the rim of the Iron Crown. Twining also mentions a relief plaque in the cathedral which appears to represent the coronation of Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor at Milan in 1209 as it was described by Morigias in 1345 and stresses the point that although four votive crowns are shown hanging above the altar, the crown which the archbishop is placing on the king&#x27;s head bears no resemblance to the Iron Crown.

Finally, Twining cites a study by Ludovico Antonio Muratori which documents the various degrees of the ecclesiastical authorities alternately authorizing and suppressing the veneration of the Iron Crown until, in 1688, the matter was subjected to be studied by the Congregation of Rites in Rome, which in 1715 diplomatically concluded its official examination by permitting the Iron Crown to be exposed for public veneration and carried in processions, but leaving the essential point of whether the iron ring came from one of the nails of Christ&#x27;s crucifixion undecided. However, subsequently Archbishop Visconti of Milan made his own decision that &quot;the iron ring in the Monza crown should be considered as one of the Nails of the Holy Cross and as an original relic.&quot; Twining notes that the clergy of Monza assert that despite the centuries that the Iron Crown has been exposed to public veneration, there is not a speck of rust on the essential inner iron ring. Lipinsky, in his examination of the Iron Crown in 1985, noted that the inner ring does not attract a magnet. Analysis of the inner ring in 1993 revealed that the ring is made of silver.

Thirty-four supposed coronations with the Iron Crown were counted by the historian Bartolomeo Zucchi from the 9th to the 17th century (beginning with Charlemagne). The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; states that the first reliable record of the use of the Iron Crown in the coronation of a King of Italy is that of the coronation of Henry VII in 1312. Later coronations in which the crown was used include:
* Charles IV (1355, at the presence of Petrarch)
* Sigismund (1431)
* Charles V (1530)
* Napoleon I (1805)
* Ferdinand I of Austria (1838)

From the 10th century, the Roman-Germanic Kings would travel to Rome to be crowned Holy Roman Emperors. En route, they traditionally stopped in Lombardy to be crowned as Kings of Italy, supposedly with the Iron Crown. The traditional site of the coronation was Pavia, the old Lombard capital, in the Basilica San Michele Maggiore. Starting with Conrad II in 1026, coronations were also performed at Milan. In 1530, Charles V received the Iron Crown simultaneously with his Imperial coronation at Bologna.
On 26 May 1805 Napoleon Bonaparte had himself crowned King of Italy at Milan, with suitable splendour and magnificence. Seated upon a throne, he was invested with the usual insignia of royalty by the Cardinal-Archbishop of Milan and, ascending the altar, he took the iron crown, placed it on his head, and exclaimed, being part of the ceremony used at the enthronement of the Lombard kings, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;God gives it to me, beware whoever touches it&#x27;).

On the occasion, Napoleon founded the Order of the Iron Crown, on 15 June 1805. After Napoleon&#x27;s fall and the annexation of Lombardy to Austria, the order was reinstituted by Emperor Francis I of Austria, on 1 January 1816.

The last to be crowned with the Iron Crown was Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria, in his role as King of Lombardy and Venetia. This occurred in Milan, on 6 September 1838.

After the Second Italian War of Independence, when the Austrians had to withdraw from Lombardy in 1859, the Iron Crown was moved to Vienna, where it remained until 1866 when it was given back to Italy after the Third Italian War of Independence.

===Coronation rite for the kings of Italy===

From the 9th to the 18th century, most Kings of Italy were also the Holy Roman Emperors, so many of them were crowned at Pavia, the official capital of the Kingdom.

The earliest definitively documented use of the Iron Crown in a coronation was at that of Henry VII at Milan in 1311 or 1312, a ceremony with French and Roman influences that was the most elaborate example of the Milanese coronation rite. It was given to the King with the words &quot; (&#x27;Receive this royal crown&#x27;) and the prayer &quot; (&#x27;God of continuity&#x27;). This followed the King&#x27;s receiving the sword of state and preceded the sceptre, verge, and orb and cross.

==Scientific analysis==
In 1993, the crown was subjected to extensive scientific analysis performed by the University of Milan using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis and radiocarbon dating. The XRF analysis on the crown metal revealed that all the foils, rosettes and bezels were made with the same alloy, made of 84–85% gold, 5–7% silver, and 8–10% copper, suggesting a contemporary construction of the main part of the crown, while the fillets external to the enamel plates and the hinge pins were made of 90–91% gold and 9–10% silver, suggesting subsequent reworking.

Three of the 24 vitreous enamel plates are visually different from the others in colour and construction and were traditionally considered to be later restorations. The XRF analysis confirmed that they were made with a different technique, with their glass being made of potassium salt, while the others are made of sodium salt (sodium is not directly detectable by the XRF analysis).

Radiocarbon dating of fragments of beeswax used to fix the enamel plates to the gold foils of the crown showed that the wax under the &quot;strange&quot; plates was from around 500 AD, while the ones under the &quot;normal&quot; plates came from around 800 AD. This is consistent with the tradition of a more antique crown, further decorated during the reign of Theoderic (with the addition of the enamels), and then extensively restored during the reign of Charlemagne.

The &quot;iron nail&quot; was found to be 99% silver, meaning the crown contains no iron. A note from the Roman Ceremonial of 1159 provides that the Iron Crown is so called &quot;&quot;, stating that the iron was once laid the crown (probably as an arch, as in other crowns of the era), not into it. Speculations have been made that the silver circle was added by the goldsmith Antellotto Bracciforte, who restored the crown in 1345 to reinforce it given that the (presumed) theft of two plates had weakened the hinges. (Currently, in one of the crown&#x27;s junctions, two of the plates are not joined by the hinge, which is too damaged, but are held only by the inner silver ring.) In 1352, for the first time, a document (the inventory of the treasury of the Cathedral of Monza) describes the crown as being .

The gems in the crown are seven red garnets, seven blue corundums (sapphires), four violet amethysts, and four gems made of glass.

==Cultural references==
A surprising image of the Iron Crown figures in Chapter 37 &quot;Sunset&quot; of Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. The brief chapter is devoted to Captain Ahab&#x27;s soliloquy. Among his delusions of persecution and grandeur, he imagines himself crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy.

The Italian film &quot;La corona di ferro&quot; (1941), directed by Alessandro Blasetti, tells a story about the arrival of the crown in Italy.

In the &quot;Father Brown&quot; TV series, the crown figures in episode 70 (The Two Deaths of Hercule Flambeau).

<text>Howard Earl Averill (May 21, 1902 – August 16, 1983) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a center fielder from 1929 to 1941, including 11 seasons for the Cleveland Indians. He was a six-time All-Star (1933–1938) and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975.

==Major League Baseball career==
Born in Snohomish, Washington, Averill broke into the Major Leagues in 1929 (at the age of 27) with the Cleveland Indians. He played for Cleveland for over ten years, and remains the all-time Indians leader in total bases, runs batted in (RBIs), runs, and triples. He also remains third in all-time Indians hits and doubles, and fourth in all-time Indians home runs and walks. During his time in Cleveland, the team never finished higher than third. His nickname was &quot;the Earl of Snohomish&quot;. He famously hit the line drive that broke Dizzy Dean&#x27;s toe in the 1937 All-Star Game. Dizzy, who had averaged 24 wins a season up to then, and only 4 wins a season after, changed his delivery due to the broken toe, damaged his arm, which led to his retiring in 1941 at the age of 31.

Averill was the first major league player to hit four home runs in a doubleheader (three home runs in the first game, one in the second game) on September 17, 1930; he was also one of the first players to hit a home run in his first Major League at-bat (April 16, 1929, opening day). Averill batted .378 in 1936, leading the American League in hits with 232, but finishing second to Luke Appling in the batting race (Appling batted .388 for the White Sox).

During a July 1 incident in 1935, Averill was lighting firecrackers with his four children as part of a pre-July 4 celebration. One exploded while he was holding it, and he suffered lacerations on the fingers of his right hand, as well as burns on his face and chest. After several weeks, he made a full recovery.

In 1937, Averill experienced temporary paralysis in his legs and was diagnosed with a congenital spine condition. This caused him to alter his batting style and become less of a power hitter.

Averill was traded to the Detroit Tigers in the middle of the 1939 season (June 14). The following season, his playing time was limited, but the Tigers reached the World Series. In the seven-game series against the Cincinnati Reds, the 38-year-old Averill went 0-for-3 in three pinch-hit attempts. The Reds won the series 4 games to 3.

In 1941, Averill struggled with the Boston Braves, batting just .118 (2-for-17) in 8 games and was released on April 29. He wound down his pro career in the Pacific Coast League with the Seattle Rainiers.

In a 13-year career, Averill was in 1,669 games played, compiling a .318 batting average (2,019-for-6,353) with 1,224 runs scored, 401 doubles, 128 triples, 238 home runs, 1,164 RBIs, 774 bases on balls, .395 on-base percentage and .534 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .970 fielding percentage. He hit better than .300 eight times. He recorded five 100+ RBI seasons in his major league career. Averill recorded five 5-hit games in his MLB career.

==After baseball==
After his career, he was very outspoken on being elected to the Hall of Fame. While he did not campaign for induction, he did make the statement that, &quot;Had I been elected after my death, I had made arrangements that my name never be placed in the Hall of Fame.&quot; Averill was inducted in 1975, eight years before his death.

He made news of a different sort, according to &quot;Baseball Digest&quot;, in the early 1960s when he was boarding an airplane to fly to a site for an old-timers&#x27; game, insisting on bringing his own bat in a gun case.

His son, Earl D. Averill, also played in the majors from 1956 through 1963. He was mainly a catcher but also played left field and a few games at infield.

<doc id="355411" wikidata="Q3345893" url="?curid=355411" title="Midland, North Carolina">
<text>Midland is a town in southern Cabarrus County in the U.S. state of North Carolina. Located in the Charlotte region of North Carolina, Midland is a 30-minute commute to uptown Charlotte. The name of the town is derived from its location approximately halfway between Charlotte and Oakboro on the railroad line. The population was 3,073 at the 2010 census.

The U.S. Postal Service has maintained a post office in Midland for many years (ZIP code 28107), and rural mail routes extend from Midland into portions of four counties.

== History ==

Midland began as a railroad town about 1913 with the arrival of rail service via the North Carolina Railroad (NCRR). The town is now incorporated, as of 2000. Prior to Midland&#x27;s becoming a railroad village, a community named Garmon existed in the area (a few miles to the east) around the Garmon Mill begun by Michael Garmon in the late-1700s, and Garmon appears on an 1864 map of North Carolina. Another community located to the west, Cabarrus Station, also predated Midland as a railroad stop, and has been incorporated into the town of Midland.

Formerly, the economy of Midland was essentially agricultural with some textile-related manufacturing jobs. With the growth of Charlotte to the west, farming has played a decreasing role in the economic life of the town. Increasingly, Midland has become a bedroom community for those commuting to work in nearby Charlotte and Concord. 

The Reed Gold Mine, site of the first discovery of gold in the United States, is located east of the town. The Reed Gold Mine is now a historic site under state management and is open to the public. The area was an important gold mining center in the 19th century; however, gold mining activity in the region predates the founding of Midland.

The Bethel Church Arbor, John Bunyan Green Farm, and Robert Harvey Morrison Farm and Pioneer Mills Gold Mine are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
The climate in Midland is temperate, with chilly winters and hot summers. Thunderstorms are frequent in warmer weather. Severe weather occurs occasionally, and a few tornadoes have been recorded in Midland and its vicinity. Snow accumulations occur on occasion in the winter, and anywhere from zero to three significant accumulations of snow might reasonably be expected in an average winter. Accumulating snows generally melt away between snow events, and there is no consistent snowpack in winter. Pleasantly warm daytime temperatures may be experienced into November. Rainfall averages per year.

The town sits approximately above sea level. The land is gently rolling with no especially high points.

US Highway 601 and NC 24/27 are the major highways.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 4,684 people, 1,182 households, and 912 families residing in the town.

==Economy==

Corning operates a large-scale fiber-optic cable manufacturing plant in Midland that underwent a $50M expansion in 2012. Intertape Polymer Group announced in 2016 that they would build a $49M advanced manufacturing plant for the e-commerce sector north of the Corning plant.

<text>Player Piano is the debut novel by American writer Kurt Vonnegut Jr., published in 1952. The novel depicts a dystopia of automation partly inspired by the author&#x27;s time working at General Electric, describing the negative impact technology can have on quality of life. The story takes place in a near-future society that is almost totally mechanized, eliminating the need for human laborers. The widespread mechanization creates conflict between the wealthy upper class, the engineers and managers, who keep society running, and the lower class, whose skills and purpose in society have been replaced by machines. The book uses irony and sentimentality, which were to become hallmarks developed further in Vonnegut&#x27;s later works.

== Plot ==
While most Americans were fighting in the third world war, the nation&#x27;s managers and engineers responded by developing ingenious automated systems that allowed factories to operate with only a few workers. Ten years after the war, most workers have now been replaced by machines. The polarization of the population is represented by the division of Ilium, New York, into &quot;Homestead&quot;, where every person not a manager or an engineer lives – added to by the growing number of those displaced from that status – and the industrialized north side of the river, inhabited by those who service and develop the machines.

The novel develops two parallel plotlines that converge only briefly at the beginning and the end of the story. The more prominent plot centers on Dr. Paul Proteus, the intelligent, 35-year-old manager of Ilium Works. The secondary plot follows the American tour of the Shah of Bratpuhr, a spiritual leader of six million residents in a distant, underdeveloped nation. These provide contrasting perspectives: that of Paul, as the embodiment of what a man within the American industrial system should strive to be, and the other of a visitor from a contrasting culture, but in which there is also a simple binary social system.

The main story follows Paul&#x27;s development from an uncritical cog in the system to one of its critics. Paul&#x27;s father had held a supremo status that had given him almost complete control over the nation&#x27;s economy. Paul has inherited his father&#x27;s reputation but harbors an uneasy dissatisfaction with the industrial system and his own contribution to society. His acknowledgment of that feeling is heightened when Ed Finnerty, an old friend whom Paul holds in high regard, informs him that he has quit his important engineering job in Washington, D.C.

Paul and Finnerty visit the &quot;Homestead&quot; section of town, where workers who have been displaced by machines live out their meaningless lives in mass-produced houses. There they meet Lasher, an Episcopal minister with a M.S. in anthropology, who helps the two engineers realize the unfairness of the system from which they have profited. Eventually learning that Lasher is the leader of a rebel group known as the &quot;Ghost Shirt Society&quot;, Finnerty instantly takes up with him. Paul is not yet bold enough to make a clean break until his superiors ask him to betray Finnerty and Lasher. 

Paul purchases a rundown farm with the intention of starting a new life there with his wife, Anita. She, however, is disgusted by the prospect of such a radically different and less privileged lifestyle. &quot;Of all the people on the north side of the river, Anita was the only one whose contempt for those in Homestead was laced with active hatred... If Paul …hadn&#x27;t married her, this was where she&#x27;d be, what she&#x27;d be.&quot; But for the moment, she uses her sexual hold on Paul to convince him to stay and compete with two other engineers, Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Garth, for a more prominent position in Pittsburgh.

While Paul takes part in the annual managerial bonding event at &quot;the Meadows&quot;, his superiors tell him that he has been chosen to infiltrate the &quot;Ghost Shirt Society&quot;, and rumors of his disloyalty to the system are circulated. Then, after arriving in Homestead, he is kidnapped and drugged by Society operatives and later made the organization&#x27;s public (but largely nominal) figurehead. Paul&#x27;s name is famous and so the organization intends to use it to their advantage. However, in the first committee meeting that Paul attends, he is captured during a police raid.

Paul is now put on public trial; but as the general population begins to riot, destroying the automated factories, he is freed. The mob, once unleashed, now goes further than the leaders had planned, destroying all means of production regardless of usefulness. Despite the brief and impressive success of the rebellion, the military quickly surrounds the town, while the population begin to use their innate abilities to rebuild the machines of their own volition. Paul, Finnerty, Lasher, and other committee members of the Society acknowledge that at least they have stood against the government&#x27;s oppressive system before surrendering themselves.

== Major themes ==
The automation of industry and the effect that it has on society are the predominant themes of &quot;Player Piano&quot;. It is &quot;a novel about people and machines, and machines frequently got the best of it, as machines will.&quot; More specifically, it delves into a theme to which Vonnegut returns, &quot;a problem whose queasy horrors will eventually be made world-wide by the sophistication of machines. The problem is this: How to love people who have no use.&quot; Unlike much dystopian fiction, the novel&#x27;s society was created by indifference, both of the populace and the technology that replaced it. As such, it is the sense of purposelessness of those living in a capitalistic society that has outgrown a need for them that must be rectified.

Mankind&#x27;s blind faith in technology and its usually-disastrous effect on society as well as the dehumanization of the poor or oppressed later became common themes throughout Vonnegut&#x27;s work. Throughout his life, Vonnegut continued to believe the novel&#x27;s themes were of relevance to society, writing, for example, in 1983 that the novel was becoming &quot;more timely with each passing day&quot;.

== Style ==
&quot;Player Piano&quot; displays the beginnings of the idiosyncratic style that Vonnegut developed and employed throughout much of his career. It has early inklings of the hallmark Vonnegutian flair of using meta-fiction, such as when a writer&#x27;s wife describes her husband&#x27;s dilemma to the Shah of Bratpuhr in the back of the limousine: that the writer&#x27;s &quot;anti-machine&quot; novel cannot get a passing &quot;readability quotient&quot; under the reading machine&#x27;s scoring algorithm. However, the fourth wall does not get broken, as in later writings. His style of self-contained chapters &quot;of no more than five hundred words, often as few as fifty&quot;, which would come to define his writing, had yet to be developed.

== Background ==
=== Influences ===
In a 1973, interview Vonnegut discussed his inspiration to write the book: I was working for General Electric at the time, right after World War II, and I saw a milling machine for cutting the rotors on jet engines, gas turbines. This was a very expensive thing for a machinist to do, to cut what is essentially one of those Brâncuși forms. So they had a computer-operated milling machine built to cut the blades, and I was fascinated by that. This was in 1949 and the guys who were working on it were foreseeing all sorts of machines being run by little boxes and punched cards. &quot;Player Piano&quot; was my response to the implications of having everything run by little boxes. The idea of doing that, you know, made sense, perfect sense. To have a little clicking box make all the decisions wasn&#x27;t a vicious thing to do. But it was too bad for the human beings who got their dignity from their jobs. In the same interview, he acknowledges that he &quot;cheerfully ripped off the plot of &quot;Brave New World&quot;, whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin&#x27;s &quot;We&quot;.&quot;

=== Title ===
A player piano is a modified piano that &quot;plays itself&quot;. The piano keys move according to a pattern of holes punched in an unwinding scroll. Unlike a music synthesizer, the instrument actually produces the sound itself, with the keys moving up and down, driving hammers that strike the strings. Like its counterpart, a player piano can be played by hand as well. When a roll is run through the instrument, the movement of its keys produce the illusion that an invisible performer is playing the instrument. Vonnegut uses the player piano as a metaphor to represent how even the most simple of activities, such as teaching oneself how to play the piano in one&#x27;s spare time, has been replaced by machines instead of people. Early in the book, Paul Proteus&#x27;s friend and future member of the Ghost Shirt Society, Ed Finnerty, is shown manually playing a player piano, suggesting the idea of humans reclaiming their animus from the machines. The book&#x27;s most tragic character is Rudy Hertz, the machinist who was the prototype recorded by the machines. They are player pianos replicating his physical motions.

== Publication history ==
This satirical take on industrialization and the rhetoric of General Electric and the big corporations, which discussed arguments very topical in the postwar United States, was instead advertised by the publisher with the more innocuous and marketable label of &quot;science fiction&quot;, a genre that was booming in mass popular culture in the 1950s. Vonnegut, surprised by that reception, wrote, &quot;I learned from reviewers that I was a science-fiction author. I didn&#x27;t know that.&quot; He was distressed because he felt that science fiction was shoved in a drawer which &quot;many serious critics regularly mistake... for a urinal&quot; because &quot;[t]he feeling persists that no one can simultaneously be a respectable writer and understand how a refrigerator works.&quot;

&quot;Player Piano&quot; was later released in paperback by Bantam Books in 1954 under the title Utopia 14 in an effort to drive sales with readers of science fiction. Paul Proteus&#x27; trial was dramatized in the 1972 TV movie &quot;Between Time and Timbuktu&quot;, which presented elements from various works by Vonnegut.

In 2009, Audible.com produced an audio version of &quot;Player Piano&quot;, narrated by Christian Rummel, as part of its Modern Vanguard line of audiobooks.

In the Italian translation, &quot;Player Piano&quot; is rendered as &quot;Piano meccanico&quot;, a double-entendre, which, by itself, can mean either &quot;player piano&quot; or &quot;mechanical plan&quot;.

==Reception==
The science fiction anthologist Groff Conklin reviewed the novel in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;, declaring it &quot;a biting, vividly alive and very effectively understated anti-Utopia.&quot; The founding editors of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas, named &quot;Player Piano&quot; to their &quot;year&#x27;s best&quot; list, describing it as &quot;Human, satirical, and exciting;... by far the most successful of the recent attempts to graft science fiction onto the serious &#x27;straight&#x27; novel.&quot; They praised Vonnegut for &quot;blending skillfully a psychological study of the persistent human problems in a mechanistically &#x27;ideal&#x27; society, a vigorous melodramatic story-line, and a sharp Voltairean satire.

&quot;Player Piano&quot; was nominated for the International Fantasy Award in 1953.

<text>Thomas William Francis Gann (13 May 1867 – 24 February 1938) was a medical doctor by profession, but is best remembered for his work as an amateur archaeologist exploring ruins of the Maya civilization.

==Personal history==
Thomas Gann was born in Murrisk Abbey, County Mayo, Ireland, the son of William Gann of Whitstable, England, and Rose Garvey of Murrisk Abbey. He was raised in Whitstable, where his parents were prominent in the social life of the town. Gann trained in medicine in Middlesex, England.

Somerset Maugham named the heroine of &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot; Rosie Gann.

==Career==
In 1894 he was appointed district medical officer for British Honduras, where he would spend most of the next quarter century. He soon developed a keen interest in the colony&#x27;s Mayan ruins, which up to then had been little documented. He also traveled in the Yucatán Peninsula, exploring ruins there.

Gann discovered a number of sites, including Lubaantun, Ichpaatun, and Tzibanche. He published the first detailed descriptions of such ruins as Xunantunich and Lamanai. He made important early explorations at Santa Rita, Louisville, and Coba. At Tulum he documented buildings overlooked by previous explorers, including a rare find of a temple with the Pre-Columbian idol still intact inside.

Midway through his career, in 1908 Gann became the honorary lecturer in Central American Antiquities at the new Institute of Archaeology of the University of Liverpool (not long after he had taken the Diploma there in Tropical Medicine). Liverpool subscribers funded several of his fieldwork seasons up to 1912.

==Retirement==
Thomas Gann retired as British Honduras&#x27;s medical officer in 1923 when he wrote several books about his travels and explorations. He sold a large number of objects he had collected in the Mayan region to the British Museum in 1924.

==Legacy==
Thomas Gann is reflected upon by different contemporaries in many ways. Some like David David Pendergast reflect on Ganns methods as destructive saying he ‘remained more destructive than protective of evidence from beginning to end’ This was supported by Gann&#x27;s independent claims of blowing up numerous mounds all across Belize, Guatemala, and Mexico to the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1897. Jared Jared Milanich took a more comedic route when discussing Gann referring to him as a &quot;mound mauler&quot; for his past actions and excavation techniques. This implies that while he doesn&#x27;t approve of his methods, he views them as something comical from a prior era. Author Cynthia Robin an anthropologist at NorthWestern] described them as both &quot;unsightly&quot; and as &quot;&#x27;Gann Holes&#x27;&quot; Though some Authors such as J.E. Thompson cut Gann some slack saying, &quot;Gann reflected the attitude of his period, which regarded excavation as the retrieval of works of art or &quot;curios,&quot; not as a means of recovering history.&quot;

<doc id="355422" wikidata="Q244383" url="?curid=355422" title="Rose of Lima">
<text>Rose of Lima, TOSD (born Isabel Flores de Oliva; 20 April 1586 24 August 1617) (, ) was a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic in Lima, Peru, Spanish Empire, who became known for both her life of severe penance and her care of the poverty stricken of the city through her own private efforts. 

Rose of Lima was born to a noble family and is the patron saint of embroidery, gardening and cultivation of blooming flowers. She was the first person born in the Americas to be canonized as a saint.

As a saint, Rose of Lima has been designated as a co-patroness of the Philippines along with Pudentiana; both saints were moved to second-class patronage in September 1942 by Pope Pius XII, but Rose remains the primary patroness of Peru and of the local people of Latin America. Her image was formerly featured on the highest denomination banknote of Peru.

==Biography==

She was born as Isabel Flores de Oliva in the city of Lima, then in the Viceroyalty of Peru, Spanish Empire, on 20 April 1586. She was one of eleven children of , a harquebusier in the Imperial Spanish army whose family were from Baños de Montemayor, Cáceres, Spain and later travelled to Puerto Rico. His wife and Rose&#x27;s mother, María de Oliva y Herrera (b. 1560), was a &quot;criolla&quot; native of Lima. Her maternal grandparents were Francisco de Oliva and Isabel de Herrera. Rose’s siblings (in birth order) were Gaspar, Bernardina, Hernando, Francisco, Juana, Antonio, Andrés, Francisco and Jacinta, all born in Lima.

Her later nickname &quot;Rose&quot; comes from an incident in her infancy: a servant claimed to have seen her face transform into a rose. In 1597 Isabel was confirmed by the Archbishop of Lima, Toribio de Mogrovejo, who was also to be declared a saint. She formally took the name of Rose (Rosa in Spanish) at that time.

As a young girl, in emulation of the noted Dominican tertiary Catherine of Siena, she began to fast three times a week and performed severe penances in secret. When she was admired for her beauty, Rose cut off her hair and rubbed peppers on her face, upset that men were beginning to take notice of her. She rejected all suitors against the objections of her friends and her family. Despite the censure of her parents, she spent many hours contemplating the Blessed Sacrament, which she received daily, an extremely rare practice in that period. She was determined to take a vow of virginity, which was opposed by her parents who wished her to marry. Finally, out of frustration, her father gave her a room to herself in the family home.

As an addition to fasting, she took permanent abstinence from eating meat. She helped the sick and hungry around her community, bringing them to her room and taking care of them. Rose sold her fine needlework and took flowers that she grew to market, to help her family. She made and sold lace and embroidery to care for the poor, and she prayed and did penance in a little grotto that she had built. Otherwise, she became a recluse, leaving her room only for her visits to church.

She attracted the attention of the friars of the Dominican Order. She wanted to become a nun, but her father forbade it, so she instead entered the Third Order of St. Dominic while living in her parents&#x27; home. In her twentieth year, she donned the habit of a tertiary and took a vow of perpetual virginity. She only allowed herself to sleep two hours a night at most so that she had more hours to devote to prayer. She donned a heavy crown made of silver, with small spikes on the inside, in emulation of the Crown of Thorns worn by Christ.

For eleven years she lived this way, with intervals of ecstasy, and eventually died on 24 August 1617, at the young age of 31, after a long illness. It is said that she prophesied the date of her death. Her funeral was held in the cathedral, attended by all the public authorities of Lima. Her feast day is on the 23rd day of August (the 30th day of August in the Traditional calendar).

==Veneration==
Rose was beatified by Pope Clement IX on 10 May 1667, and canonized on 12 April 1671, by Pope Clement X, and was the first Catholic in the Americas to be declared a saint. Her shrine, alongside those of her friends Martin de Porres and John Macias, is currently located inside of the convent of Saint Dominic in Lima. The Catholic Church says that many miracles followed her death: there were stories that she had cured a leper, and that, at the time of her death, the city of Lima smelled like roses; roses also started falling from the sky. Many places in the New World are named Santa Rosa after her.

Her liturgical feast was inserted into the General Roman Calendar in 1729 for celebration initially on 30 August, because 24 August, the date of her death, is the feast of Saint Bartholomew the Apostle and 30 August was the closest date not already allocated to a well-known saint. Pope Paul VI&#x27;s 1969 revision of the calendar made 23 August available, the day on which her feast day is now celebrated throughout the world, including Spain, but excluding Peru and some other Latin American countries, where 30 August is a public holiday in her honor.

Early lives of Rosa were written by the Dominican Father Hansen, &quot;Vita Sanctae Rosae&quot; (2 vols., Rome, 1664–1668), and Vicente Orsini, afterward. Pope Benedict XIII wrote &quot;Concentus Dominicano, Bononiensis ecclesia, in album Sanctorum Ludovici Bertrandi et Rosae de Sancta Maria, ordinero praedicatorum&quot; (Venice, 1674).

There is a park named for her in downtown Sacramento, California. A plot of land at 7th and K streets was given to the Catholic Church by Peter Burnett, first Governor of the State of California. Father Peter Anderson built one of the first of two churches in the diocese to be consecrated under the patronage of St. Rose.

In the Caribbean twin-island state of Trinidad and Tobago, the Santa Rosa Carib Community, located in Arima, is the largest organization of indigenous peoples on the island. The second oldest parish in the Diocese of Port of Spain is also named after this saint. The Santa Rosa Church, which is located in the town of Arima, was established on 20 April 1786, as the Indian Mission of Santa Rosa de Arima, on the foundations of a Capuchin Mission previously established in 1749.

On the Caribbean Island of Saint Lucia there are two flower festivals supported by their Societies. Each society has a patron saint on whose feast day the grande fete is celebrated. For the Roses it is the feast of St. Rose of Lima on 30 August; and for the Marguerites it is that of St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, 17 October.

Rose&#x27;s skull, surmounted with a crown of roses, is on public display at the Basilica in Lima, Peru, along with that of Martin de Porres. It was customary to keep the torso in the basilica and pass the head around the country.

She is also commemorated on 24 August in some places.

===Patronage===
Saint Rose is the patroness of the Americas, the indigenous people of the Americas, and of Peru, especially the city of Lima, Sittard in the Netherlands, of the Indies, and of the Philippines.

==Legacy==

On the last weekend in August, the Fiesta de Santa Rosa is celebrated in Dixon, New Mexico, and the Sint Rosa Festival in Sittard, Netherlands. Also, in Sibbe, Netherlands, a maypole dedicated to Saint Rose is erected on the first Saturday after the 23rd of August by the local Jonkheid.

A barony of Saint Rose of Lima was created in the Royal House of Rwanda on 25 July 2016 by the Catholic king in exile, King Kigeli V of Rwanda.

<text>A castle town is a settlement built adjacent to or surrounding a castle. Castle towns were common in Medieval Europe. Some examples include small towns like Alnwick and Arundel, which are still dominated by their castles. In Western Europe, and England particularly, it is common for cities and towns that were not castle towns to instead have been organized around cathedrals.

Towns organized around Japanese castles are called . Castles are typically built near towns to gain and equip supplies.

<text>Brandenberg is a municipality in the Austrian state of Tyrol in the district Kufstein. It consists of the &quot;Brandenberg&quot; village and the &quot;Aschau&quot; locality (German: &quot;Ortsteil&quot;).

Brandenberg was first mentioned in 1140, and became an independent municipality in the beginning of the 19th century. The municipality is located in the valley of the Brandenberger Ache river, a tributary of the Inn River. To the north, it shares a border with Germany. Neighbouring Austrian and German municipalities are Achenkirch, Breitenbach am Inn, Kramsach, Kreuth, Rottach-Egern, Steinberg am Rofan, and Thiersee.

A local specialty is the &quot;Prügeltorte&quot; cake.

<doc id="355435" wikidata="Q170089" url="?curid=355435" title="Cho Oyu">
<text>Cho Oyu (Nepali: चोयु; ; ) is the sixth-highest mountain in the world at above sea level. Cho Oyu means &quot;Turquoise Goddess&quot; in Tibetan. The mountain is the westernmost major peak of the &quot;Khumbu&quot; sub-section of the Mahalangur Himalaya 20 km west of Mount Everest. The mountain stands on the China–Nepal border, between the Tibet Autonomous Region and Koshi Province.

Just a few kilometres west of Cho Oyu is Nangpa La (5,716m/18,753 ft), a glaciated pass that serves as the main trading route between the Tibetans and the Khumbu&#x27;s Sherpas. This pass separates the Khumbu and Rolwaling Himalayas. Due to its proximity to this pass and the generally moderate slopes of the standard northwest ridge route, Cho Oyu is considered the easiest 8,000 metre peak to climb. It is a popular objective for professionally guided parties.

==Height==
Cho Oyu&#x27;s height was originally measured at and at the time of the first ascent it was considered the 7th highest mountain on earth, after Dhaulagiri at (Manaslu, now , was also estimated lower at ). A 1984 estimate of made it move up to sixth place. New measurements made in 1996 by the Government of Nepal Survey Department and the Finnish Meteorological Institute in preparation for the Nepal Topographic Maps put the height at 8,188 m, one remarkably similar to the used by Edmund Hillary in his 1955 book &quot;High Adventure&quot;.

==Climbing history==
Cho Oyu was first attempted in 1952 by an expedition organised and financed by the Joint Himalayan Committee of Great Britain as preparation for an attempt on Mount Everest the following year. The expedition was led by Eric Shipton and included Edmund Hillary, Tom Bourdillon and George Lowe. A foray by Hillary and Lowe was stopped due to technical difficulties and avalanche danger at an ice cliff above and a report of Chinese troops a short distance across the border influenced Shipton to retreat from the mountain rather than continue to attempt to summit.

The mountain was first climbed on October 19, 1954, via the north-west ridge by Herbert Tichy, Joseph Jöchler and Sherpa Pasang Dawa Lama of an Austrian expedition. Cho Oyu was the fifth eight-thousander to be climbed, after Annapurna in June 1950, Mount Everest in May 1953, Nanga Parbat in July 1953 and K2 in July 1954. Until the ascent of Mount Everest by Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler in 1978, this was the highest peak climbed without supplemental oxygen.
Cho Oyu is considered the easiest eight-thousander, with the lowest death-summit ratio (th of Annapurna&#x27;s). It is the second most climbed eight-thousander after Everest (whose height makes it the most popular), and has over four times the ascents of the third most popular eight-thousander, Gasherbrum II. It is marketed as a &quot;trekking peak&quot;, achievable for climbers with high fitness, but low mountaineering experience. It has a broadly flat summit plateau with no cairn (the traditional prayer flags on Cho Oyu&#x27;s summit plateau do not mark the &quot;technical&quot; summit), which can be a source of confusion, and debate, amongst climbers (see Elizabeth Hawley).

*1952 First reconnaissance of north-west face by Edmund Hillary and party.
*1954 First ascent by Austrians Joseph Jöchler and Herbert Tichy, and Pasang Dawa Lama (Nepal)
*1958 Second ascent of the peak, by an Indian expedition. Sherpa Pasang Dawa Lama reaches the peak for the second time. First death on Cho Oyu.
*1959 Four members are killed in an avalanche during a failed international women&#x27;s expedition.
*1964 A controversial third ascent by a German expedition as there is no proof of reaching the summit. Two mountaineers die of exhaustion in camp 4 at .
*1978 Edi Koblmüller and Alois Furtner of Austria summit via the extremely difficult southeast face.
*1983 Reinhold Messner succeeds on his fourth attempt, with Hans Kammerlander and Michael Dacher.
*1984 Věra Komárková (USA) and Dina Štěrbová (Czechoslovakia) become the first women to climb Cho Oyu. Štěrbová is also the first woman from Czechoslovakia to climb an 8,000er.
*1985 On February 12, Poles Maciej Berbeka and Maciej Pawlikowski make the first winter ascent via a new route on the southeast face. It is the only winter ascent on an eight-thousander made on a new route and the first winter ascent without additional oxygen support. The ascent was repeated three days later by Andrzej Heinrich and Jerzy Kukuczka, with Kukuczka setting an additional record for climbing two eight-thousanders during the same winter, as he had earlier climbed Dhaulagiri.
*1988 On November 2, a Slovenian expedition consisting of Iztok Tomazin, Roman Robas, Blaž Jereb, Rado Nadvešnik, Marko Prezelj and Jože Rozman reach the summit via the never before climbed north face.
*1994 On May 13 Carlos Carsolio sets a world record speed ascent from base camp to summit, ascending in 18 hours and 45 minutes.
*1994 First solo ascent via the South West face by Yasushi Yamanoi.
*2000 Russian-Finnish expedition of nine climbers summitted the top, but two of them disappeared in the attempt and were presumed dead. 
*2004 Second summit by a double amputee (Mark Inglis)
*2007 Second Indian ascent. Expedition led by Abhilekh Singh Virdi.
*2009 Clifton Maloney, husband of US Representative Carolyn Maloney and at that time the oldest American to summit an eight-thousander, died at age 71 after summiting on 25 September. His final words were &quot;I’m the happiest man in the world. I’ve just summited a beautiful mountain.&quot;
*2011 Dutch climber Ronald Naar dies after becoming unwell at .

<text>The eight-thousanders are the 14 mountains recognized by the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation (UIAA) as being more than in height above sea level, and sufficiently independent of neighbouring peaks. There is no precise definition of the criteria used to assess independence, and at times, the UIAA has considered whether the list should be expanded to 20 mountain peaks by including the major satellite peaks of eight-thousanders. All of the eight-thousanders are located in the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain ranges in Asia, and their summits lie in the altitude range known as the death zone.

From 1950 to 1964, all 14 eight-thousanders were summited by expedition climbers in the summer (the first to be summited was Annapurna I in 1950, and the last was Shishapangma in 1964), and from 1980 to 2021, all 14 were summited in the winter (the first to be summited in winter being Mount Everest in 1980, and the last being K2 in 2021). On a variety of statistical techniques, the deadliest eight-thousander is Annapurna I (one death – climber or climber support – for every three summiters), followed by K2 and Nanga Parbat (one death for every four to five summiters), and then Dhaulagiri and Kangchenjunga (one for every six to seven summiters).

The first person to summit all 14 eight-thousanders was the Italian climber Reinhold Messner in 1986, who did not use any supplementary oxygen. In 2010, Edurne Pasaban, a Basque Spanish mountaineer became the first woman to summit all 14 eight-thousanders, but with the aid of supplementary oxygen. In 2011, Austrian Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner became the first woman to summit all 14 eight-thousanders without the aid of supplementary oxygen. In 2013, South Korean Kim Chang-ho climbed all 14 eight-thousanders in 7 years and 310 days, without the aid of supplementary oxygen. In July 2023, Kristin Harila and Tenjen Lama Sherpa set a speed record of 92 days for climbing all 14 eight-thousanders, with supplementary oxygen. In July 2022, Sanu Sherpa became the first person to summit all 14 eight-thousanders twice, which he did from 2006 to 2022.

Issues with false summits (e.g. Cho Oyu, Annapurna I and Dhaulagiri), or separated dual summits (e.g. Shishapangma and Manaslu), have led to disputed claims of ascents. In 2022, after several years of research, a team of experts reported that they could only confirm evidence that three climbers, Ed Viesturs, Veikka Gustafsson and Nirmal Purja, had stood on the true geographic summit of all 14 eight-thousanders.

==Climbing history==

===First ascents===

The first recorded attempt on an eight-thousander was when Albert F. Mummery, Geoffrey Hastings and J. Norman Collie tried to climb Pakistan&#x27;s Nanga Parbat in 1895. The attempt failed when Mummery and two Gurkhas, Ragobir Thapa and Goman Singh, were killed by an avalanche.

The first successful ascent of an eight-thousander was by the French climbers Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal, who reached the summit of Annapurna on 3 June 1950 using expedition climbing techniques as part of the 1950 French Annapurna expedition. Due to its location in Tibet, Shishapangma was the last eight-thousander to be ascended, which was completed by a Chinese team led by Xu Jing in 1964 (Tibet&#x27;s mountains were closed by China to foreigners until 1978).

The first winter ascent of an eight-thousander was by a Polish team led by Andrzej Zawada on Mount Everest, with Leszek Cichy and Krzysztof Wielicki reaching the summit on 17 February 1980; all-Polish teams would complete nine of the first fourteen winter ascents of eight-thousanders. The final eight-thousander to be climbed in winter was K2, whose summit was ascended by a 10-person Nepalese team on 16 January 2021.

Only two climbers have completed more than one first ascent of an eight-thousander, Hermann Buhl (Nanga Parbat and Broad Peak) and Kurt Diemberger (Broad Peak and Dhaulagiri). Buhl&#x27;s summit of Nanga Parbat in 1953 is notable as being the only solo first ascent of one of the eight-thousanders. The Polish climber Jerzy Kukuczka is noted for creating over ten new routes on various eight-thousander mountains. Italian climber Simone Moro made the first winter ascent of four eight-thousanders (Shishapangma, Makalu, Gasherbrum II, and Nanga Parbat), while three Polish climbers have each made three first winter ascents of an eight-thousander, Maciej Berbeka (Cho Oyu, Manaslu, and Broad Peak), Krzysztof Wielicki (Everest, Kangchenjunga, and Lhotse) and Jerzy Kukuczka (Dhaulagiri I, Kangchenjunga, and Annapurna I).

===All 14===

On 16 October 1986, Italian Reinhold Messner became the first person to climb all 14 eight-thousanders. In 1987, Polish climber Jerzy Kukuczka became the second person to accomplish this feat. Messner summited each of the 14 peaks without the aid of bottled oxygen, a feat that was only repeated by the Swiss Erhard Loretan nine years later in 1995 (Kukuczka had used supplementary oxygen while summiting Everest and on no other eight-thousander).

On 17 May 2010, Spanish climber Edurne Pasaban became the first woman to summit all 14 eight-thousanders. In August 2011, Austrian climber Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner became the first woman to climb the 14 eight-thousanders without the use of supplementary oxygen.

The first couple and team to summit all 14 eight-thousanders were the Italians Nives Meroi (who was the second woman to accomplish this feat without supplementary oxygen), and her husband on 11 May 2017. The couple climbed alpine style, without the use of supplementary oxygen or other support.

On 23 May 2023, Nepali guide Kami Rita summitted Everest for the 28th time (a record for Everest), becoming the first-ever person to climb an eight-thousander 38 times. In July 2022, Sanu Sherpa became the first person to summit all 14 eight-thousanders twice. He started with Cho Oyu in 2006, and completed the double by summiting Gasherbrum II in July 2022.

On 20 May 2013, South Korean climber Kim Chang-ho set a new speed record of climbing all 14 eight-thousanders, without the use of supplementary oxygen, in 7 years and 310 days. On 29 October 2019, the British-Nepali climber Nirmal Purja set a speed record of 6 months and 6 days for climbing all 14 eight-thousanders with the use of supplementary oxygen. On 27 July 2023, Kristin Harila and Tenjen Lama Sherpa set a new speed record of 92 days for climbing all 14 eight-thousanders with supplementary oxygen.

===Deadliest===


The eight-thousanders are the world&#x27;s deadliest mountains. The extreme altitude and the fact that the summits of all eight-thousanders lie in the Death Zone mean that climber mortality (or &quot;death rate&quot;) is high. Two metrics are quoted to establish a &quot;death rate&quot; (i.e. broad and narrow) that are used to rank the eight-thousanders in order of &quot;deadliest&quot;.

* Broad death rate: The first metric is the &quot;ratio of total deaths on the mountain to successful climbers summiting&quot; over a given period. The &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; uses this metric to name Annapurna I as the deadliest eight-thousander, and the world&#x27;s deadliest mountain with roughly one person dying for every three people who successfully summit, i.e. a ratio of circa 30%. Using consistent data from 1950 to 2012, mountaineering statistician Eberhard Jurgalski (see table) used this metric to show Annapurna is the deadliest mountain (31.9%), followed by K2 (26.5%), Nanga Parbat (20.3%), Dhaulagiri (15.4%) and Kangchenjunga (14.1%). Other statistical sources including &quot;MountainIQ&quot;, used a mix of data periods from 1900 to Spring 2021 but had similar results showing Annapurna still being the deadliest mountain (27.2%), followed by K2 (22.8%), Nanga Parbat (20.75%), Kangchenjunga (15%), and Dhaulagiri (13.5%). Cho Oyu was the safest at 1.4%.
* Narrow death rate: The drawback of the first metric is that it includes the deaths of any support climbers or climbing sherpas that went above base camp in assisting the climb; therefore, rather than being the probability that a climber will die attempting to summit an eight-thousander, it is more akin to the total human cost in getting a climber to the summit. In the &quot;Himalayan Database&quot; (HDB) tables, the climber (or member) &quot;Death Rate&quot; is the &quot;ratio of deaths above base camp, of all climbers who were hoping to summit and who went above base camp&quot; (calculated for 1950 to 2009), and is closer to a true &quot;probability of death&quot; (see table below). The data is only for the Nepalese Himalaya and therefore does not include K2 or Nanga Parbat. HDB estimates the probability of death for a climber attempting the summit of an eight-thousander is still highest for Annapurna I (4%), followed by Kangchenjunga (3%) and Dhaulagiri (3%); the safest is still Cho Oyu at 0.6%.

The tables from the HDB for eight-thousanders also show that the death rate of climbers for the period 1990 to 2009 (e.g. modern expeditions), is roughly half that of the combined 1950 to 2009 period, i.e. climbing is becoming safer for the climbers attempting the summit.

== List of first ascents ==
From 1950 to 1964, all 14 of the eight-thousanders were summited in the summer (the first was Annapurna I in 1950, and the last was Shishapangma in 1964), and from 1980 to 2021, all 14 were summited in the winter (the first being Everest in 1980, and the last being K2 in 2021).

== List of climbers of all 14 ==

There is no single undisputed source or arbitrator for verified ascents of Himalayan eight-thousander peaks.

Various mountaineering journals, including the &quot;Alpine Journal&quot; and the &quot;American Alpine Journal&quot;, also maintain extensive records and archives on expeditions to the eight-thousanders, but do not always opine on disputed ascents, and nor do they maintain registers or lists of verified ascents of the eight-thousanders.

Elizabeth Hawley&#x27;s &quot;The Himalayan Database&quot;, is considered as an important source for verified ascents for the &quot;Nepalese Himalayas&quot;. Online databases of Himalayan ascents pay close regard to &quot;The Himalayan Database&quot;, including the website &quot;AdventureStats.com&quot;, and the &quot;Eberhard Jurgalski List&quot;.

===Verified ascents===


The &quot;No O2&quot; column lists people who have climbed all 14 eight-thousanders without supplementary oxygen.
=== Disputed ascents===
Claims have been made for summiting all 14 peaks for which not enough evidence was provided to verify the ascent; the disputed ascent in each claim is shown in parentheses in the table below. In most cases, the Himalayan chronicler Elizabeth Hawley is considered a definitive source regarding the facts of the dispute. Her &quot;The Himalayan Database&quot; is the source for other online Himalayan ascent databases (e.g. AdventureStats.com). The &quot;Eberhard Jurgalski List&quot; is also another important source for independent verification of claims to have summited all 14 eight-thousanders.

===Verification issues===

A recurrent problem with verification is the confirmation that the climber reached the true peak of the eight-thousander. Eight-thousanders present unique problems in this regard as they are so infrequently summited, their summits have not yet been exhaustively surveyed, and summiting climbers are often suffering the extreme altitude and weather effects of being in the death zone.

Cho Oyu for example, is a recurrent problem eight-thousander as its true peak is a small hump about a thirty minutes walk into the large flat summit plateau that lies in the death zone. The true peak is often obscured in very poor weather, and this led to the disputed ascent (per the table above) of British climber, Alan Hinkes (who has refused to re-climb the peak). Shishapangma is another problem peak because of its dual summits, which despite being close in height, are up to two hours climbing time apart and require the crossing of an exposed and dangerous snow ridge. When Hawley judged that Ed Viesturs had not reached the true summit of Shishapangma (which she deduced from his summit photos and interviews), he then re-climbed the mountain to definitively establish his ascent.

In a May 2021 interview with the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Jurgalski pointed out further issues with false summits on Annapurna I (a long ridge with multiple summits), Dhaulagiri (misleading false summit metal pole), and Manaslu (additional sharp and dangerous ridge to the true summit, like Shishapangma), noting that of the existing 44 accepted claims (as per the table earlier), at least 7 had serious question marks (these were in addition to the table of disputed ascents), and even noting that &quot;It is possible that no one has ever been on the true summit of all 14 of the 8,000-meter peaks&quot;. In June 2021, Australian climber Damien Gildea wrote an article in the &quot;American Alpine Journal&quot; on the work that Jurgalski and a team of international experts were doing in this area, including publishing detailed surveys of the problem summits using data from the German Aerospace Center.

In July 2022, Jurgalski posted conclusions of the team&#x27;s research (the wider team being of Rodolphe Popier and Tobias Pantel of The Himalayan Database, and Damien Gildea, Federico Bernardi, and Thaneswar Guragai). According to their analysis, only three climbers, Ed Viesturs, Veikka Gustafsson and Nirmal Purja have stood on the true summit of all 14 eight-thousanders, and no female climber had yet done so. Viesturs is also the first to have done so without the use of oxygen. Jurgalski allowed for the fact that they had deliberately not stood on the true summit of Kangchenjunga out of religious respect. The team has not formally published their work, and according to Popier, they had not decided about &quot;the best respectful form to present it&quot;.

==Proposed expansion==

In 2012, to relieve capacity pressure and overcrowding on the world&#x27;s highest mountain, greater restrictions were placed on expeditions to the summit of Mount Everest. To address the growing capacity constraints, Nepal lobbied the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (or UIAA) to reclassify five subsidiary summits (two on Lhotse and three on Kanchenjunga), as standalone eight-thousanders, while Pakistan lobbied for a sixth subsidiary summit (on Broad Peak) as a standalone eight-thousander. See table below for list of all subsidiary summits of eight-thousanders.

In 2012, the UIAA initiated the &quot;ARUGA Project&quot;, with an aim to see if these six new -plus peaks could feasibly achieve international recognition. The proposed six new eight-thousander peaks have a topographic prominence above , but none would meet the wider UIAA prominence threshold of (the lowest prominence of the existing 14 eight-thousanders is Lhotse, at ). Critics noted that of the six proposed, only Broad Peak Central, with a prominence of , would even meet the prominence threshold to be a British Isles Marilyn. The appeal noted the UIAA&#x27;s 1994 reclassification of Alpine four-thousander peaks used a prominence threshold of , amongst other criteria; the logic being that if worked for summits, then is proportional for summits.

, there has been no conclusion by the UIAA and the proposals appear to have been set aside.

<doc id="355439" wikidata="Q297190" url="?curid=355439" title="Giovanni Giolitti">
<text>Giovanni Giolitti (; 27 October 1842 – 17 July 1928) was an Italian statesman. He was the prime minister of Italy five times between 1892 and 1921. He is the longest-serving democratically elected prime minister in Italian history, and the second-longest serving overall after Benito Mussolini. A prominent leader of the Historical Left and the Liberal Union, he is widely considered one of the most wealthy, powerful and important politicians in Italian history; due to his dominant position in Italian politics, Giolitti was accused by critics of being an authoritarian leader and a parliamentary dictator.

Giolitti was a master in the political art of &quot;trasformismo&quot;, the method of making a flexible, centrist coalition of government which isolated the extremes of the Left and the Right in Italian politics after the unification. Under his influence, the Liberals did not develop as a structured party and were a series of informal personal groupings with no formal links to political constituencies. The period between the start of the 20th century and the start of World War I, when he was prime minister and Minister of the Interior from 1901 to 1914, with only brief interruptions, is often referred to as the &quot;Giolittian Era&quot;.

A liberal with strong ethical concerns, Giolitti&#x27;s periods in office were notable for the passage of a wide range of progressive social reforms, together with the enactment of several policies of government intervention. Besides putting in place several tariffs, subsidies, and government projects, Giolitti also nationalized the private telephone and railroad operators. Liberal proponents of free trade criticized the &quot;Giolittian System&quot;, although Giolitti himself saw the development of the national economy as essential in the production of wealth.

The primary focus of Giolittian politics was to rule from the centre with slight and well-controlled fluctuations between conservatism and progressivism, trying to preserve the institutions and the existing social order. Right-wing critics like Luigi Albertini considered him a socialist due to the courting of socialist and leftist votes in parliament in exchange for political favours, while left-wing critics like Gaetano Salvemini accused him of being a corrupt politician and of winning elections with the support of criminals. Nonetheless, his highly complex legacy continues to stimulate intense debate among writers and historians.

==Early life==

Giolitti was born at Mondovì, in Piedmont. His father Giovenale Giolitti had been working in the avvocatura dei poveri, an office assisting poor citizens in both civil and criminal cases. He died in 1843, a year after Giovanni was born. The family moved in the home of his mother Enrichetta Plochiù in Turin.

His mother taught him to read and write; his education in the gymnasium San Francesco da Paola of Turin was marked by poor discipline and little commitment to study. He did not like mathematics and the study of Latin and Greek grammar, preferring history and reading the novels of Walter Scott and Honoré de Balzac. At sixteen he entered the University of Turin and, after three years, he earned a law degree in 1860.

His uncle was a member of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Sardinia and a close friend of Michelangelo Castelli, the secretary of Camillo Benso di Cavour; however, Giolitti did not appear particularly interested in the Risorgimento and differently to many of his fellow students, he did not enlist to fight in the Italian Second War of Independence.

===Career in the public administration===
Giolitti pursued a career in public administration in the Ministry of Grace and Justice. That choice prevented him from participating in the decisive battles of the Risorgimento (the unification of Italy), for which his temperament was not suited anyway, but this lack of military experience would be held against him as long as the Risorgimento generation was active in politics.

In 1869, Giolitti moved to Calabria and was appointed as chief secretary of the Central Tax Commission. He moved to Rome Italy in 1905. That year he married Rosa Sobrero and they would have seven children – Giovenale, Enrichetta, Lorenzo, Luisa, Federico, Maria and Giuseppe. In 1870, he moved to the Ministry of Finance, becoming a high official and working along with important members of the ruling Right, like Quintino Sella and Marco Minghetti. In the same year, he married Rosa Sobrero, the niece of Ascanio Sobrero, a famous chemist, who discovered nitroglycerine.

In 1877, Giolitti was appointed to the Court of Audit and in 1882 to the Council of State.

==Beginnings of the political career==

At the 1882 Italian general election he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of Parliament) for the Historical Left. This election was a great victory for the ruling Left of Agostino Depretis, which won 289 seats out of 508.

As deputy, he chiefly acquired prominence by attacks on Agostino Magliani, Treasury Minister in the cabinet of Depretis.

Following Depretis&#x27;s death on 29 July 1887 Francesco Crispi, a notable politician and patriot, became the leader of the Left group and was also appointed prime minister by King Umberto I.

On 9 March 1889, Giolitti was selected by Crispi as the new Minister of Treasury and Finance. But in October 1890, Giolitti resigned from his office due to contrasts with Crispi&#x27;s colonial policy. A few weeks before, the Ethiopian emperor Menelik II had contested the Italian text of the Wuchale Treaty, signed by Crispi, stating that it did not oblige Ethiopia to be an Italian protectorate. Menelik informed the foreign press and the scandal erupted.

After the fall of the government led by the new prime minister Antonio Starabba di Rudinì in May 1892, Giolitti, with the help of a court clique, received from the King the task of forming a new cabinet.

==First term as prime minister==
Giolitti&#x27;s first term as prime minister (1892–1893) was marked by misfortune and misgovernment. The building crisis and the commercial rupture with France had impaired the situation of the state banks, of which one, the Banca Romana, had been further undermined by maladministration.

===Banca Romana scandal===
The &quot;Banca Romana&quot; had loaned large sums to property developers but was left with huge liabilities when the real estate bubble collapsed in 1887. Then prime minister Francesco Crispi and his treasury minister Giolitti knew of the 1889 government inspection report, but feared that publicity might undermine public confidence and suppressed the report.

The Bank Act of August 1893 liquidated the &quot;Banca Romana&quot; and reformed the whole system of note issue, restricting the privilege to the new &quot;Banca d&#x27;Italia&quot; – mandated to liquidate the &quot;Banca Romana&quot; – and to the &quot;Banco di Napoli&quot; and the &quot;Banco di Sicilia&quot;, and providing for stricter state control. The new law failed to effect an improvement. Moreover, he irritated public opinion by raising to senatorial rank the governor of the &quot;Banca Romana&quot;, Bernardo Tanlongo, whose irregular practices had become a byword, which would have given him immunity from prosecution. The senate declined to admit Tanlongo, whom Giolitti, in consequence of an intervention in parliament upon the condition of the Banca Romana, was obliged to arrest and prosecute. During the prosecution, Giolitti abused his position as premier to abstract documents bearing on the case.

===Fasci Siciliani===

Another main problem that Giolitti had to face during his first term as prime minister was the Fasci Siciliani, a popular movement of democratic and socialist inspiration, which arose in Sicily in the years between 1889 and 1894. The Fasci gained the support of the poorest and most exploited classes of the island by channelling their frustration and discontent into a coherent programme based on the establishment of new rights. Consisting of a jumble of traditionalist sentiment, religiosity, and socialist consciousness, the movement reached its apex in the summer of 1893, when new conditions were presented to the landowners and mine owners of Sicily concerning the renewal of sharecropping and rental contracts.

Upon the rejection of these conditions, there was an outburst of strikes that rapidly spread throughout the island, and was marked by violent social conflict, almost rising to the point of insurrection. The leaders of the movement were not able to keep the situation from getting out of control. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene. Giovanni Giolitti tried to put a halt to the manifestations and protests of the Fasci Siciliani, his measures were relatively mild. On November 24, Giolitti officially resigned as prime minister. In the three weeks of uncertainty before Crispi formed a government on 15 December 1893, the rapid spread of violence drove many local authorities to defy Giolitti&#x27;s ban on the use of firearms.

In December 1893, 92 peasants lost their lives in clashes with the police and army. Government buildings were burned along with flour mills and bakeries that refused to lower their prices when taxes were lowered or abolished.

===Resignation===
Simultaneously a parliamentary commission of inquiry investigated the condition of the state banks. Its report, though acquitting Giolitti of personal dishonesty, proved disastrous to his political position, and the ensuing Banca Romana scandal obliged him to resign. His fall left the finances of the state disorganized, the pensions fund depleted, diplomatic relations with France strained in consequence of the massacre of Italian workmen at Aigues-Mortes, and a state of revolt in the Lunigiana and by the Fasci Siciliani in Sicily, which he had proved impotent to suppress. Despite the heavy pressure from the King, the army and conservative circles in Rome, Giolitti neither treated strikes – which were not illegal – as a crime, nor dissolved the Fasci, nor authorised the use of firearms against popular demonstrations. His policy was &quot;to allow these economic struggles to resolve themselves through amelioration of the condition of the workers&quot; and not to interfere in the process.

==Indictment and comeback==
After his resignation, Giolitti was indicted for abuse of power as minister, but the Supreme Court of Cassation quashed the indictment by denying the competence of the ordinary tribunals to judge ministerial acts.

For several years he was compelled to play a passive part, having lost all credit. But by keeping in the background and giving public opinion time to forget his past, as well as by parliamentary intrigue, he gradually regained much of his former influence.

Moreover, Giolitti made capital of the Socialist agitation and of the repression to which other statesmen resorted, and gave the agitators to understand that were he premier he would remain neutral in labour conflicts. Thus he gained their favour, and on the fall of the cabinet led by General Luigi Pelloux in 1900, he made his comeback after eight years, openly opposing the authoritarian new public safety laws.

Due to a left-ward shift in parliamentary liberalism at the general election in June, after the reactionary crisis of 1898–1900, he dominated Italian politics until World War I.

Between 1901 and 1903 he was appointed Italian Minister of the Interior by Prime Minister Giuseppe Zanardelli, but critics accused Giolitti of being the de facto prime minister, due to Zanardelli&#x27;s age.

==Second term as prime minister==
On 3 November 1903, Giovanni Giolitti was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III.

===Social policy===

During his second term as head of the government onwards, Giolitti courted the left and labour unions with social legislation, including subsidies for low-income housing, preferential government contracts for worker cooperatives, and old age and disability pensions. Under a circular of November 1903, as noted by one study, “the most substantial investigation of drinking water was initiated.&quot; A law of January the 31st 1904 extended accident insurance to a number of agricultural workers, while a law of July 1904 offered fiscal and economic support to companies wishing to establish business in the Neapolitian area. That same year, the State facilitated the building of an Apulian aquaduct, while national legislation was passed aimed at enhancing living conditions in asylums. A healthcare reform law was introduced in February 1904 which, as noted by one study, reiterated some key concepts of a previous health law passed under Francesco Crispi, “extending its potential through appropriate modifications and additions. The interventions were essentially concentrated on four issues: making the fate of municipal doctors less precarious, completing health care for the poor, facilitating better organization of local hygiene supervision and initiating more effective protection of the population in the countryside.” In addition, a law of March 1904 established a pension fund for municipal secretaries. 

A law of March 1904 concerning the Basilicata region (aimed at promoting social and economic conditions) included provisions such as public works (including the building of farmhouses, sewers, water supplies and roads). The Orlando law of 1904 increased the mandatory education age to 12 while also providing (as noted by one study) “for a general increase in state commitment with the splitting of large classes and the state’s contribution to the payment of teacher’s salaries.” The Public Welfare Commission Law of 1904 required general public welfare institutions to allocate a third of their funds to poor children. Conditions for staff in the government libraries and prisons, together with the lower ranks of the army, were improved. Provision was made in connection with a sickness and old age fund for workmen, while a pension fund was set up for workmen in the tobacco factories and for veterans of the War of Independence. In addition, prisoners were also given the right to work in the open. A modification of the laws concerning hospitals and similar institutions, designed to provide (as Giolitti noted) “for an effective trusteeship over the funds of these bodies,” was carried out, while public health legislation was updated. Financial provision for elementary school teachers and primary schools was improved, and a duty of landlords to provide healthy habitations for agricultural workers was established. Co-operative agricultural and industrial societies were also given the right to apply for public contracts. After 1904 (as noted by one historian), &quot;municipal councils could have public works and irrigation schemes carried out by co-operatives.&quot;

===Relations with the Socialists===
Giolitti tried to sign an alliance with the Italian Socialist Party, which was growing so fast in the popular vote and became a friend of the Socialist leader Filippo Turati. Giolitti would have liked to have Turati as a minister in his cabinets, but the Socialist leader always refused, due to the opposition of the left wing of his party.

===Approach towards labor union strikes===

Giolitti, differently from his predecessors like Francesco Crispi, strongly opposed the repression of labour union strikes. According to him, the government had to act as a mediator between entrepreneurs and workers. These concepts, which today may seem obvious, were considered revolutionary at the time. The conservatives harshly criticized him; according to them, this policy was a complete failure that could create fear and disorder.

===Resignation===
However, Giolitti too, had to resort to strong measures in repressing some serious disorders in various parts of Italy, and thus he lost the favour of the Socialists. In March 1905, feeling himself no longer secure, he resigned, indicating Fortis as his successor. When the leader of the Historical Right, Sidney Sonnino, became premier in February 1906, Giolitti did not openly oppose him, but his followers did.

== Third term as prime minister ==
When Sonnino lost his majority in May 1906, Giolitti became prime minister once more. His third government was known as the &quot;long ministry&quot; (&quot;lungo ministero&quot;).

===Financial policy===

In the financial sector, the main operation was the conversion of the annuity, with the replacement of fixed-rate government bonds maturing (with a coupon of 5%) with others at lower rates (3.75% before and then 3.5%). The conversion of the annuity was conducted with considerable caution and technical expertise: the government, in fact, before undertaking it, requested and obtained the guarantee of numerous banking institutions.

The criticism that the government received from conservatives proved unfounded: public opinion followed almost fondly the events relating, as the conversion immediately took on the symbolic value of a real and lasting fiscal consolidation and a stable national unification. The resources were used to complete the nationalization of the railways.

The strong economic performance and the careful budget management led to currency stability; this was also caused by a mass emigration and especially on remittances that Italian migrants sent to their relatives back home. The 1906–1909 triennium is remembered as the time when &quot;the lira was premium on gold&quot;.

===Social policy===
As a means of strengthening the role of labour inspectors, Law No. 380 of 1906 “provided extraordinary funds to the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce with a view implementing the Italian-French Convention. Consequently, as a result of a ministerial circular of November 1906, the first territorial labour inspection services started to be established in Turin, Milan and Brescia.” A law of 1907 fixed the age of admission to employment at 14 years for underground work in mines not employing mechanical motive power while forbidding the employment of children under 15 in especially dangerous occupations. A law of June 1906 established a social security system for bus, tram and rail workers. This was later extended to employees of extra-urban lines in 1907, and to shipyard workers in 1910. A law of June 1908 established a fund for state railway employees. 

On 7 July 1907 an important law providing for a weekly day of rest was passed, and that same year a treaty was ratified with France concerning industrial accidents, &quot;by which French laborers in Italy and Italian laborers in France were given all the benefits of the insurance laws of the country in which they are employed.&quot; A law was also passed on 22 March 1908 abolishing night work in bakeries. The 1907 Malaria Law &quot;contained important dispositions protecting women and children, banning night work and limiting the workday to nine hours, prohibited work in the last month of pregnancy, and mandated two breaks to breastfeed children.&quot; A law of 27 February 1908, concerning inexpensive or people’s dwellings, granted communes the power &quot;to construct people&#x27;s dwellings exclusively for renting purposes, people’s lodging houses, and free public dormitories whenever a commune considers it necessary to supply dwellings for the poorer classes of the population and there are neither cooperative societies nor private organizations undertaking these constructions or when these societies exist but do not meet the commune’s needs.&quot; Various laws related to agriculture were also introduced, public works for the South were initiated, the tax on heating oil used by the poor was cut, and sickness and old age insurance was extended and improved.

===1908 Messina earthquake===
On 28 December 1908, a strong earthquake of magnitude of 7.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity scale of XI, hit Sicily and Calabria. About ten minutes after the earthquake, the sea on both sides of the Strait suddenly withdrew a 12-meter (39-foot) tsunami swept in, and three waves struck nearby coasts. It impacted hardest along the Calabrian coast and inundated Reggio Calabria after the sea had receded 70 meters from the shore. The entire Reggio seafront was destroyed and numbers of people who had gathered there perished. Nearby Villa San Giovanni was also badly hit. Along the coast between Lazzaro and Pellaro, houses and a railway bridge were washed away. The cities of Messina and Reggio Calabria were almost completely destroyed and between 75,000 and 200,000 lives were lost.

News of the disaster was carried to Prime Minister Giolitti by Italian torpedo boats to Nicotera, where the telegraph lines were still working, but that was not accomplished until midnight at the end of the day. Rail lines in the area had been destroyed, often along with the railway stations.

The Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (&quot;Royal Navy&quot;) and &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; (Royal Army) responded and began searching, treating the injured, providing food and water, and evacuating refugees (as did every ship). Giolitti imposed martial law with all looters to be shot, which extended to survivors foraging for food. King Victor Emmanuel III and Queen Elena arrived two days after the earthquake to assist the victims and survivors. The disaster made headlines worldwide and international relief efforts were launched. With the help of the Red Cross and sailors of the Russian and British fleets, search and cleanup were expedited.

===1909 election and resignation===
In 1909 general election, Giolitti&#x27;s Left gained 54.4% of votes and 329 seats out of 508. Giolitti found himself faced with the necessity for renewing the steamship conventions which were about to lapse. The bill presented by his Cabinet on this subject was designed to conciliate conflicting politicaI interests rather than to solve the actual problem. The vigorous attacks of the conservative opposition, led by Baron Sidney Sonnino, induced Giolitti to adjourn the debate until the autumn, when, the Cabinet having been defeated on a point of procedure, he resigned on 2 December. Giolitti proposed Sonnino as new prime minister, but after a few months, he withdrew his support for Sonnino&#x27;s government and supported the moderate Luigi Luzzatti as new head of government. Given his party&#x27;s position, Giolitti remained the real power.

==After the premiership==
===Universal manhood suffrage===
During Luzzatti&#x27;s government the political debate had begun to focus on the enlargement of the right to vote. The Socialists, in fact, but also the Radicals and the Republicans, has long demanded the introduction of universal manhood suffrage, necessary in a modern liberal democracy. Luzzatti developed a moderate proposal with some requirements under which a person had the right to vote (age, literacy and annual taxes). The government&#x27;s proposal was of a gradual expansion of the electorate, but without reaching the universal male suffrage.

Giolitti, speaking in the Chamber, declared himself in favor of universal male suffrage, overcoming the impulse to government positions. His aim was to cause Luzzatti&#x27;s resignation and become prime minister again; moreover he want to start a cooperation with the Socialists in the Italian parliamentary system. Furthermore, Giolitti intended to extend his pre-war reforms. Conscripted men were fighting overseas in Libya and so it appeared as a symbol of national unity that they be given the vote.

Giolitti believed that the extension of the franchise would bring more conservative rural voters to the polls as well as drawing votes from grateful socialists.

Many historians considered Giolitti&#x27;s proposal a mistake. Universal male suffrage, contrary to Giolitti&#x27;s opinions, would destabilize the entire political establishment: the &quot;mass parties,&quot; i.e. Socialist, Popular and later Fascist, were the ones who benefitted from the new electoral system. Giolitti &quot;was convinced that Italy can not grow economically and socially without enlarging the number of those who partecipated [sic?] in public life.&quot;

Sidney Sonnino and the Socialists Filippo Turati and Claudio Treves proposed to introduce also female suffrage, but Giolitti strongly opposed it, considering it too risky, and suggested the introduction of female suffrage only at the local level.

==Fourth term as prime minister==

Although a man of first-class financial ability, great honesty and wide culture, Luzzatti had not the strength of character necessary to lead a government: he showed lack of energy in dealing with opposition and tried to avoid all measures likely to make him unpopular. Furthermore, he never realized that with the chamber, as it was then constituted, he only held office at Giolitti&#x27;s good pleasure. So on 30 March 1911 Luzzatti resigned from his office and King Victor Emmanuel III again gave Giolitti the task to form a new cabinet.

===Social policy===
During his fourth term, Giolitti tried to seal an alliance with the Italian Socialist Party, proposing the male universal suffrage, implementing left-wing social policies, introducing the National Insurance Institute, which provided for the nationalization of insurance at the expense of the private sector. Moreover, Giolitti appointed the socialist Alberto Beneduce as the head of this institute. Law No.1361 of 1912 and the Royal Decree No. 431 that was approved in 1913 “represented the legal basis of the institutional activity of the Labour Inspectorate, still structured within the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and Trade.” The purpose of the inspectorate was to supervise the application of labor legislation. A law introduced on July the 6th 1912 authorized the formation (in the province of Liguria) of an agricultural credit association. That same year, benefits were introduced for pregnant women and mothers.

Also in 1912, Giolitti had Parliament approve an electoral reform bill that expanded the electorate from 3 million to 8.5 million voters – introducing near-universal male suffrage – while commenting that first &quot;teaching everyone to read and write&quot; would have been a more reasonable route. Considered his most daring political move, the reform probably hastened the end of the Giolittian Era because his followers controlled fewer seats after the 1913.

During his ministry, the Parliament approved a law requiring the payment of a monthly allowance to deputies. In fact, at that time the parliamentarians had no type of salary, and this favoured the wealthy candidates.

===Libyan War===

The claims of Italy over Libya dated back to Turkey&#x27;s defeat by Russia in the war of 1877–1878 and subsequent discussions after the Congress of Berlin in 1878, in which France and Great Britain had agreed to the occupation of Tunisia and Cyprus respectively, both parts of the then declining Ottoman Empire. When Italian diplomats hinted about possible opposition by their government, the French replied that Tripoli would have been a counterpart for Italy. In 1902, Italy and France had signed a secret treaty which accorded freedom of intervention in Tripolitania and Morocco; however, the Italian government did little to realize the opportunity and knowledge of Libyan territory and resources remained scarce in the following years.
The Italian press began a large-scale lobbying campaign in favour of an invasion of Libya at the end of March 1911. It was fancifully depicted as rich in minerals, well-watered, and defended by only 4,000 Ottoman troops. Also, the population was described as hostile to the Ottoman Empire and friendly to the Italians: the future invasion was going to be little more than a &quot;military walk&quot;, according to them.

The Italian government was hesitant initially, but in the summer the preparations for the invasion were carried out and Prime Minister Giolitti began to probe the other European major powers about their reactions to a possible invasion of Libya. The Socialist party had strong influence over public opinion; however, it was in opposition and also divided on the issue, acting ineffectively against military intervention.

An ultimatum was presented to the Ottoman government led by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) party on the night of 26–27 September. Through Austrian intermediation, the Ottomans replied with the proposal of transferring control of Libya without war, maintaining a formal Ottoman suzerainty. This suggestion was comparable to the situation in Egypt, which was under formal Ottoman suzerainty but was actually controlled by the United Kingdom. Giolitti refused, and war was declared on 29 September 1911. He was criticised for having declared war without consulting Parliament, and for not having summoned it until several months later. His conduct of the Government during the campaign was also severely criticised, as he acted as though the war were merely an affair of internal politics and party combinations.

On 18 October 1912, Turkey officially surrendered. As a result of this conflict, Italy captured the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet (province), of which the main sub-provinces were Fezzan, Cyrenaica, and Tripoli itself. These territories together formed what became known as Italian Libya.

During the conflict, Italian forces also occupied the Dodecanese islands in the Aegean Sea. Italy had agreed to return the Dodecanese to the Ottoman Empire according to the Treaty of Ouchy in 1912 (also known as the First Treaty of Lausanne (1912), as it was signed at the Château d&#x27;Ouchy in Lausanne, Switzerland.) However, the vagueness of the text allowed a provisional Italian administration of the islands, and Turkey eventually renounced all claims on these islands in Article 15 of the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923.
Although minor, the war was a precursor of World War I as it sparked nationalism in the Balkan states. Seeing how easily the Italians had defeated the weakened Ottomans, the members of the Balkan League attacked the Ottoman Empire before the war with Italy had ended.

The invasion of Libya was a costly enterprise for Italy. Instead of the 30 million lire a month judged sufficient at its beginning, it reached a cost of 80 million a month for a much longer period than was originally estimated. The war cost Italy 1.3 billion lire, nearly a billion more than Giolitti estimated before the war. This ruined ten years of fiscal prudence.

===Foundation of the Liberal Union===
In 1913, Giolitti founded the Liberal Union, which was simply and collectively called Liberals. The Union was a political alliance formed when the Left and the Right merged in a single centrist and liberal coalition which largely dominated the Italian Parliament.

Giolitti had mastered the political concept of &quot;trasformismo&quot;, which consisted in making flexible centrist coalitions of government which isolated the extremes of the political left and the political right.

===Gentiloni Pact===

In 1904, Pope Pius X informally gave permission to Catholics to vote for government candidates in areas where the Italian Socialist Party might win. Since the Socialists were the arch-enemy of the Church, the reductionist logic of the Church led it to promote any anti-Socialist measures. Voting for the Socialists was grounds for excommunication from the Church.

When Pius X lifted the ban on Catholic participation in politics in 1913, and the electorate was expanded by a new franchise law from 3 million to 8 million, he collaborated with the Catholic Electoral Union, led by Ottorino Gentiloni in the Gentiloni pact. It directed Catholic voters to Giolitti supporters who agreed to favour the Church&#x27;s position on such key issues as funding private Catholic schools and blocking a law allowing divorce.

The Vatican had two major goals at this point: to stem the rise of Socialism and to monitor the grassroots Catholic organizations (co-ops, peasant leagues, credit unions, etc.). Since the masses tended to be deeply religious but rather uneducated, the Church felt they were in need of conveyance so that they did not support improper ideals like Socialism or Anarchism. Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giolitti understood that the time was ripe for cooperation between Catholics and the liberal system of government.

===1913 election and resignation===
A general election was held on 26 October 1913, with a second round of voting on 2 November. Giolitti&#x27;s Liberal Union narrowly retained an absolute majority in the Chamber of Deputies, while the Radical Party emerged as the largest opposition bloc. Both groupings did particularly well in Southern Italy, while the Italian Socialist Party gained eight seats and was the largest party in Emilia-Romagna; however, the election marked the beginning of the decline of the Liberal establishment.

In March 1914, the Radicals of Ettore Sacchi brought down Giolitti&#x27;s coalition, who resigned on 21 March.

==World War I==
After Gioilitti&#x27;s resignation, the conservative Antonio Salandra was brought into the national cabinet as the choice of Giolitti himself, who still commanded the support of most Italian parliamentarians; however, Salandra soon fell out with Giolitti over the question of Italian participation in World War I. Giolitti opposed Italy&#x27;s entry into the war on the grounds that Italy was militarily unprepared and he tried to use his personal hold over the parliamentary majority to upset the Salandra Cabinet, but was frustrated by an uprising of public opinion in favour of war. At the outbreak of the war in August 1914, Salandra declared that Italy would not commit its troops, maintaining that the Triple Alliance had only a defensive stance and Austria-Hungary had been the aggressor. In reality, both Salandra and his ministers of Foreign Affairs, Antonino Paternò Castello, who was succeeded by Sidney Sonnino in November 1914, began to probe which side would grant the best reward for Italy&#x27;s entrance in the war and to fulfil Italy&#x27;s irredentist claims.

On 26 April 1915, a secret pact, the Treaty of London or London Pact (), was signed between the Triple Entente (the United Kingdom, France, and the Russian Empire) and the Kingdom of Italy. According to the pact, Italy was to leave the Triple Alliance and join the Triple Entente. Italy was to declare war against Germany and Austria-Hungary within a month in return for territorial concessions at the end of the war. Giolitti was initially unaware of the treaty. His aim was to get concessions from Austria-Hungary to avoid war.

While Giolitti supported neutrality, Salandra and Sonnino, supported intervention on the side of the Allies, and secured Italy&#x27;s entrance into the war despite the opposition of the majority in parliament (&quot;see Radiosomaggismo&quot;). On 3 May 1915, Italy officially revoked the Triple Alliance. In the following days Giolitti and the neutralist majority of the Parliament opposed declaring war, while nationalist crowds demonstrated in public areas for entering the war. On 13 May 1915, Salandra offered his resignation, but Giolitti, fearful of nationalist disorder that might break into open rebellion, declined to succeed him as prime minister and Salandra&#x27;s resignation was not accepted. On 23 May 1915, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary.

On 18 May 1915, Giovanni Giolitti retired to Cavour and kept aloof from politics for the duration of the conflict. He consequently lost his influence over public opinion, and in many quarters was regarded as little better than a traitor.

==Fifth term as prime minister==
Giolitti returned to politics after the end of the conflict. In the electoral campaign of 1919 he charged that an aggressive minority had dragged Italy into war against the will of the majority, putting him at odds with the growing movement of Fascists. This election was the first one to be held with a proportional representation system, which was introduced by the government of Francesco Saverio Nitti.

===Social policy===
In October 1920, a decree was issued providing guaranteed tenure to illegal land occupiers, and in January 1921 a bill was introduced guaranteeing (until the end of 1922) all jobs in the agricultural sector.

===Red Biennium===

The election took place in the middle of &quot;Biennio Rosso&quot; (&quot;Red Biennium&quot;) a two-year period, between 1919 and 1920, of intense social conflict in Italy, following the war. The revolutionary period was followed by the violent reaction of the Fascist blackshirts militia and eventually by the March on Rome of Benito Mussolini in 1922.

The &quot;Biennio Rosso&quot; took place in the context of an economic crisis at the end of the war, with high unemployment and political instability. It was characterized by mass strikes, worker manifestations as well as self-management experiments through land and factory occupations. In Turin and Milan, workers councils were formed and many factory occupations took place under the leadership of anarcho-syndicalists. The agitations also extended to the agricultural areas of the Padan plain and were accompanied by peasant strikes, rural unrests and guerrilla conflicts between left-wing and right-wing militias.

In the general election, the fragmented Liberal governing coalition lost the absolute majority in the Chamber of Deputies, due to the success of the Italian Socialist Party and the Italian People&#x27;s Party.

Giolitti became prime minister again on 15 June 1920, because he was considered the only one who could solve that dramatic situation. As he did before, he did not accept the demands of landowners and entrepreneurs asking the government to intervene by force. He succeeded in forming a cabinet which comprised a number of non-Giolittians of all parties, but only a few of his own old guard, so that he won the support of a considerable part of the parliament, although the Socialists and the Popolari (Catholics) rendered his hold somewhat precarious.

To the complaints of Giovanni Agnelli, who intentionally described a dramatic and exaggerated situation of FIAT, which was occupied by workers, Giolitti replied: &quot;Very well, I will give orders to the artillery to bomb it&quot;. After a few days, the workers spontaneously ceased the strike. The Prime Minister was aware that an act of force would have only aggravated the situation and also suspected that in many cases the entrepreneurs were linked to the occupation of factories by workers.

===Fiume Exploit===
Before entering the war, Italy had made a pact with the Allies, the Treaty of London, in which it was promised all of the Austrian Littoral, but not the city of Fiume. After the war, at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, this delineation of territory was confirmed, with Fiume remaining outside of Italian borders, instead joined with adjacent Croatian territories into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Moreover, Giolitti&#x27;s last term saw Italy relinquish control over most of the Albanian territories it gained after World War I, following prolonged combat against Albanian irregulars in Vlorë.
The Italian nationalist and poet Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio was angered by what he considered to be the handing over of the city of Fiume. On 12 September 1919, he led around 2,600 troops from the Royal Italian Army (the Granatieri di Sardegna), Italian nationalists and irredentists, into a seizure of the city, forcing the withdrawal of the inter-Allied (American, British and French) occupying forces. Their march from Ronchi dei Legionari to Fiume became known as the &quot;Impresa di Fiume&quot; (&quot;Fiume Exploit&quot;).

On the same day, D&#x27;Annunzio announced that he had annexed the territory to the Kingdom of Italy. He was enthusiastically welcomed by the Italian population of Fiume. The Italian government of Giolitti opposed this move. D&#x27;Annunzio, in turn, resisted pressure from Italy. The plotters sought to have Italy annexe Fiume but were denied. Instead, Italy initiated a blockade of Fiume while demanding that the plotters surrender.

The approval of the Treaty of Rapallo on 12 November 1920, between Italy and Yugoslavia, turned Fiume into an independent state, the Free State of Fiume. D&#x27;Annunzio ignored the Treaty of Rapallo and declared war on Italy itself. On 24 December 1920, Giolitti sent the Italian Royal Army to Fiume and ordered the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; to bombard the city; these forced the Fiuman legionnaires to evacuate and surrender the city.

The Free State of Fiume would officially last until 1924, when Fiume was eventually annexed to the Kingdom of Italy under the terms of the Treaty of Rome. The administrative division was called the Province of Fiume.

===1921 election and resignation===
When workers&#x27; occupation of factories increased the fear of a communist takeover and led the political establishment to tolerate the rise of the fascists of Benito Mussolini, Giolitti enjoyed the support of the fascist squadristi and did not try to stop their forceful takeovers of city and regional government or their violence against their political opponents.

In 1921 Giolitti founded the National Blocs, an electoral list composed by his Liberals, the Italian Fasces of Combat led by Benito Mussolini, the Italian Nationalist Association led by Enrico Corradini, and other right-wing forces. Giolitti&#x27;s aim was to stop the growth of the Italian Socialist Party.

Giolitti called for new elections in May 1921, but his list obtained only 19.1% of votes and a total of 105 MPs. The disappointing results forced him to step down.

==Rise of Fascism==

Still the head of the liberals, Giolitti did not resist the country&#x27;s drift towards Italian Fascism. In 1921, he supported the cabinet of Ivanoe Bonomi, a social-liberal who led the Italian Reformist Socialist Party; when Bonomi resigned, the Liberals proposed again Giolitti as prime minister, considering him the only one who could save the country from civil war. The People&#x27;s Party of Don Luigi Sturzo, which was the senior party in the coalition, strongly opposed him. On 26 February 1922, King Victor Emmanuel III gave Luigi Facta the task of forming a new cabinet. Facta was a Liberal and close friend of Giolitti.

When the Fascist leader Benito Mussolini marched on Rome in October 1922, Giolitti was in Cavour. On 26 October, former prime minister Antonio Salandra warned the then prime minister Facta that Mussolini was demanding his resignation and that he was preparing to march on Rome; however, Facta did not believe Salandra and thought that Mussolini would govern quietly at his side. To meet the threat posed by the bands of Fascist troops gathering outside Rome, Facta, who had resigned but continued to hold power, ordered a state of siege for Rome. Having had previous conversations with the king about the repression of fascist violence, he was sure the king would agree, but Victor Emmanuel III refused to sign the military order. On 28 October, the King handed power to Mussolini, who was supported by the military, the business class, and the right wing.

Mussolini pretended to be willing to take a subalternate ministry in a Giolitti or Salandra cabinet but then demanded the Presidency of the Council. Giolitti supported Mussolini&#x27;s government initially – accepting and voting in favour of the controversial Acerbo Law, which guaranteed that a party obtaining at least 25 per cent and the largest share of the votes would gain two-thirds of the seats in parliament. He shared the widespread hope that the fascists would become a more moderate and responsible party upon taking power, but withdrew his support in 1924, voting against the law that restricted press freedom. During a speech in the Chamber of Deputies, Giolitti said to Mussolini: &quot;For the love of your country, do not treat the Italian people as if they did not deserve the freedom they always had in the past!&quot;

In December 1925, the provincial council of Cuneo, in which Giolitti was re-elected president in August, voted a motion which asked him to join the National Fascist Party. Giolitti, who by that time was completely opposed to the regime, resigned from his office. In 1928 he spoke to the Chamber against the law which effectively abolished the elections, replacing them with the ratification of governmental appointments.

==Death and legacy==

Powerless, Giolitti remained in Parliament until his death in Cavour, Piedmont, on 17 July 1928. His last words to the priest were: &quot;My dear father, I am old, very old. I served in five governments, I could not sing &quot;Giovinezza&quot;.&quot; &quot;Giovinezza&quot;, which means &quot;youth&quot;, was the official anthem of the Fascist regime.

According to his biographer Alexander De Grand, Giolitti was Italy&#x27;s most notable prime minister after Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour. Like Cavour, Giolitti came from Piedmont; like other leading Piedmontese politicians, he combined a pragmatism with an Enlightenment faith in progress through material advancement. An able bureaucrat, he had little sympathy for the idealism that had inspired much of the Risorgimento. He tended to see discontent as rooted in frustrated self-interest and believed that most opponents had their price and could be transformed eventually into allies.

The primary objective of Giolittian politics was to govern from the political centre with slight and well-controlled fluctuations, now in a conservative direction, then in a progressive one, trying to preserve the institutions and the existing social order. Critics from the political right considered him a &quot;socialist&quot; due to the courting of socialist votes in parliament in exchange for political favours; writing for the , Luigi Albertini mockingly described Giolitti as &quot;the Bolshevik from the Most Holy Annunciation&quot; after his Dronero speech advocating Italy&#x27;s neutrality during World War I like the Socialists. Critics from the political left called him &quot;ministro della malavita&quot; (&quot;Minister of the Underworld&quot;), a term coined by the historian Gaetano Salvemini, accusing him of winning elections with the support of criminals.

According to one study, Giolitti represented a new kind of liberalism, noting that

Giolitti stands out as one of the major liberal reformers of late 19th- and early 20th-century Europe alongside the French Georges Clemenceau (Independent Radicals) and the British David Lloyd George (Liberal Party). He was a staunch adherent of 19th-century elitist liberalism trying to navigate the new tide of mass politics. A lifelong bureaucrat aloof from the electorate, Giolitti introduced near universal male suffrage and tolerated labour strikes. Rather than reform the state as a concession to populism, he sought to accommodate the emancipatory groups, first in his pursuit of coalitions with socialist and Catholic movements, and at the end of his political life in a failed courtship with Italian Fascism.

Antonio Giolitti, the post-war leftist politician, was his grandson.

==Giolittian Era==

Giolitti&#x27;s policy of never interfering in strikes and leaving even violent demonstrations undisturbed at first proved successful, but indiscipline and disorder grew to such a pitch that Zanardelli, already in bad health, resigned, and Giolitti succeeded him as prime minister in November 1903. Giolitti&#x27;s prominent role in the years from the start of the 20th century until 1914 is known as the Giolittian Era, in which Italy experienced an industrial expansion, the rise of organised labour and the emergence of an active Catholic political movement.

The economic expansion was secured by monetary stability, moderate protectionism and government support of production. Foreign trade doubled between 1900 and 1910, wages rose, and the general standard of living went up. Nevertheless, the period was also marked by social dislocations. There was a sharp increase in the frequency and duration of industrial action, with major labour strikes in 1904, 1906 and 1908.

Emigration reached unprecedented levels between 1900 and 1914 and rapid industrialization of the North widened the socio-economic gap with the South. Giolitti was able to get parliamentary support wherever it was possible and from whoever was willing to cooperate with him, including socialists and Catholics, who had been excluded from government before. Although an anti-clerical he got the support of the catholic deputies repaying them by holding back a divorce bill and appointing some to influential positions.

Giolitti was the first long-term Prime Minister of Italy in many years because he mastered the political concept of &quot;trasformismo&quot; by manipulating, coercing and bribing officials to his side. In elections during Giolitti&#x27;s government, voting fraud was common, and Giolitti helped improve voting only in well-off, more supportive areas, while attempting to isolate and intimidate poor areas where opposition was strong. Many critics accused Giolitti of manipulating the elections, piling up majorities with the restricted suffrage at the time, using the prefects just as his contenders; however, he refined the practice in the general elections of 1904 and 1909 that gave the Liberals secure majorities.

More positively, the Giolittian Era was characterized by a great deal of progressive social and economic reform. As noted by one study

<text>Mikhail Naumovich Epstein (also transliterated Epshtein; ; born 21 April 1950) is a Russian-American literary scholar, essayist, and cultural theorist best known for his contributions to the study of Russian postmodernism. He is the Emeritus S. C. Dobbs Professor of Cultural Theory and Russian Literature at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. His writings encompass Russian literature and intellectual history, the philosophy of religion, the creation of new ideas in the age of electronic media, semiotics, and interdisciplinary approaches in the humanities. His works have been translated into over 26 languages. 

The Modern Language Association of America awarded Epstein the Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize for Studies in Slavic Languages and Literatures for his book &quot;Ideas Against Ideocracy: Non-Marxist Thought of the Late Soviet Period (1953–1991)&quot; on 6 December 2023. 

==Biography==
Mikhail Naumovich Epstein was born April 21, 1950 in Moscow, USSR, the only child of Naum Moiseevich Epstein, an accountant, and Maria Samuilovna Lifshits, an economist at Transport Publishing House. He graduated from the Department of Philology at Moscow State University in 1972 with a degree in Russian and spent the next six years as a researcher at the Department of Theoretical Problems, World Literature Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. In 1978, he joined the Union of Soviet Writers. Epstein also began to explore Moscow&#x27;s underground poetry and art scene of the 1970s, developing a lifelong interest in conceptualism, metarealism, and the cross-cultural interplay of ideas.

Throughout the 1980s, Epstein actively engaged with Moscow&#x27;s intellectual life. He founded the Essayists&#x27; Club in 1982. In 1986, as President Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s policy of Glasnost permitted more open questioning of Soviet cultural orthodoxies, Epstein established the Image and Thought association, which later gave rise to the Bank of New Ideas and Terms and the Laboratory of Contemporary Culture groups in Moscow. He was awarded the St. Petersburg-based Andrei Bely Prize for Research in the Humanities in 1991.

In 1990, Epstein emigrated to the United States, where he spent a semester teaching at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, before joining the faculty of the Russian and East Asian Languages and Cultures Department at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Almost immediately, he received a year-long fellowship at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars(Washington, D.C.) to research Soviet ideological language. Upon his return to Emory, Epstein taught a variety of graduate and undergraduate courses in subjects ranging from literary theory, semiotics, and intellectual history to 19th-and 20th-century Russian literature.

From 1992-1994, Epstein researched the history of Russian thought of the late Soviet period thanks to a grant from the National Council for Soviet and East European Research.

In the second half of the 1990s, as the World Wide Web rapidly permeated both academic and popular culture, Epstein embraced the new medium for cross-cultural communication. His internet projects during this time include The InteLnet (Intellectual Network), 1995 &quot;The Book of Books&quot; (since 1998), and &quot;The Gift of a Word: The Projective Lexicon of the Russian Language&quot; (since 2000). InteLnet&#x27;s Bank of New Ideas was recognized by the Institute for Social Inventions, awarding it the 1995 Creativity Social Innovations Award. 

From fall 1999 to the spring of 2001, and again from fall of 2003 to the spring of 2006, Epstein co-chaired the interdisciplinary Gustafson faculty seminar at Emory University.

In the spring of 2011, he was appointed IAS Fellow and Prowse Fellow at Van Mildert College, Durham University Institute of Advanced Study in Durham, U.K. He remained at Durham from 2012-2015 as Professor and Founding Director of the Centre for Humanities Innovation, where he founded the Repository of New Ideas.

==Research and scholarship==

Epstein&#x27;s research interests in the humanities include postmodernism; contemporary philosophy and theology, in particular the philosophy of culture and language; the poetics and history of Russian literature; the semiotics of everyday life, and the evolution of language.

== Russian postmodernism ==
Epstein pioneered the study of Russian postmodernism, affirming its place in global postmodernity. In his books &quot;After the Future: The Paradoxes of Postmodernism and Contemporary Russian Culture&quot; (1995) and &quot;Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture&quot; (with Alexander Genis and Slobodanka Vladiv-Glover, 1999, 2015), he situated Russian fiction, poetry, art and spirituality of the 1970s–1990s both along the continuum of metaphysically oriented metarealism and linguistically self–reflective conceptualism, and in the context of the global postmodern literary-cultural conversation. According to Epstein, the first wave of Russian postmodernism harkened back to Soviet-era socialist realism of the 1930s-1950s, which opposed the &quot;obsolete&quot; aesthetic individualism of modernism, erased distinctions between elite and mass culture, and tried to construct a post-historical space where all the great discourses of the past could be merged and resolved.

Socialist realism managed to erase semantic differences between idea and reality, the signifier and the signified. Despite these commonalities, socialist realism lacked the playful, ironically self-conscious aspect of mature postmodernism. It was not until the late 1950s and again the 1970s that Soviet artists and writers such as Ilya Kabakov, Vitaly Komar, Aleksandr Melamid, Dmitri Prigov, Vsevolod Nekrasov, and others turned a distinctly postmodern, playful, ironic gaze toward the ideological simulations of socialist realism (heroic workers, collective struggle, communal apartment, the glorious communist future, etc.).

Instead of denouncing Soviet ideology as a lie, Russian postmodern writers and artists viewed ideas or concepts in and of themselves as the only true substance of the Soviet way of life. Thus, Epstein presents two separate phases of Russian postmodernism: &quot;naïve&quot; — socialist realism, and &quot;reflective&quot;  — conceptualism. These two Russian postmodernisms, in effect, both complement and contradict each other due to a significant historical gap. In contrast, the development of Western postmodernism was more straightforward and less complex, concentrated within a single historical period.

== Transculturalism ==
Epstein has written and lectured extensively on culturology and its outgrowth, transculture. As a distinct field of study, culturology developed in the 1960s–1970s, in parallel to cultural studies in the West and in opposition to the dominant Marxist philosophy of the Soviet era. Advanced from different angles by thinkers such as Mikhail Bakhtin, Juri Lotman, and Sergei Averintsev, culturology investigates, describes, and links diverse cultural phenomena previously approached from separate fields such as history, philosophy, sociology, literary and art criticism. It seeks to rise above social, national, and historical distinctions, examining both &quot;culture&quot; as an integral whole and &quot;cultures&quot; as diverse, infinitely rich and intrinsically valuable sites of encoding human phenomena.

Epstein built on the foundation of culturology with his conception of transculturalism, a conscious liberation from the strictures of one&#x27;s own specific, inherently incomplete culture and cultivation of a radical openness toward and dialogue with others. For Epstein, emigration provided an opportunity to study the interaction of cultures firsthand. He describes the transcultural model as distinct from both the American &quot;melting pot&quot;, in which cultural distinctions are merged and subsumed into a national norm, and multiculturalism, which posits pride in discrete cultural identities based on racial, ethnic, or sexual differences. According to Epstein, &quot;Transculture is an emerging sphere where humans position themselves free from the limitations of the primary culture(s) of their home environment. The elements of transculture are freely chosen by people rather than dictated by rules and prescriptions within their given cultures.&quot; Transculture acknowledges the need to see the self in the other, allowing the multiplication of possible worlds, a boundless fluidity of discourses, values, and knowledge systems that would embrace difference rather than seek to obliterate it.

This insight inspired Epstein to revisit the collective improvisation events he had conducted at the Club of Essayists and Center for Experimental Creativity in Moscow in the 1980s. Epstein held similar &quot;collective brainstorming&quot; events as laboratory models of transcultural activity at Bowling Green State University (1996), the international conference &quot;The Future of the Humanities. International School of Theory in Humanities&quot;, Santiago de Compostela University (1997) and Emory University (1998-2004). These participatory improvisational sessions aimed to &quot;explore creativity, technology, and the role of spirituality in everyday mental processes&quot;.

== Minimal religion / &quot;poor faith&quot; ==
Epstein&#x27;s research on post-Soviet Russian cultural and spiritual conditions brought him to the concept of &quot;minimal religion&quot;, a phenomenon of post-atheist religiosity originating in the first country to experience 70 years of mass, state-sanctioned atheism. Apart from the significant number of Russians who turned to traditional Russian Orthodox practice or other faiths (Judaism, Protestant Christianity, Islam, etc.) in the 1970s–1990s, roughly a quarter of Russian poll respondents profess a general belief in God that is unaffiliated with any organized church or religious doctrine. In abandoning atheism, these &quot;minimal believers&quot; seek to fill a spiritual void with a holistic view of God, above and beyond the historic divisions and prescriptive rituals of organized religion. However, in contrast to Western secular humanism or agnosticism, Epstein posits minimal religion in Russia as essentially theistic. His term &quot;poor faith&quot; refers not to inadequacy but freedom from the material trappings of traditional religions: possessions, buildings, ritual objects, and intermediaries between the individual and God. The minimal believer possesses only faith in the here and now, without any institutional forms or organizations (as distinct from Protestant denominations).

Furthermore, Epstein emphasizes that Soviet mass atheism was a necessary prerequisite to the rebirth of faith in the form of minimal religion. &quot;Atheism had used the diversity of religions to argue for the relativity of religion. Consequently, the demise of atheism signaled the return to the simplest, virtually empty, and infinite form of monotheism and monofideism. If God is one, then faith must be one.&quot;

== Transformative humanities ==
Epstein advocates for the importance of the humanities and their transformative potential. In a time of increasing focus on STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) subjects, Epstein&#x27;s work asserts that the humanities can play a vital role in shaping the future of society: &quot;The future-oriented humanities must not limit themselves to scholarship, but rather should seek to create their own ways to change what they study, to transform the human world.&quot; According to Epstein, an educational program uniting major fields of the humanities could be established under the acronym PILLAR: philosophy, intellectual history, language, literature, art, religion. Rather than teach the six humanistic disciplines as separate and discrete subjects, PILLAR integrates them into a cohesive learning paradigm based on real-world and future–oriented applications. As a transdisciplinary strategy complementary to STEM, PILLAR integrates not only traditional areas of the humanities but also scholarship and inventorship.

Epstein envisions transformative humanities (or transhumanities) as a practical means of transforming culture, much like technology serves as a practical application of the natural sciences and politics does with the social sciences. Constructively, transhumanities might include building new intellectual communities, initiating new artistic movements, creating new modes of communication, and developing new paradigms of thought, rather than simply studying or criticizing the products of culture.

In his book &quot;The Transformative Humanities: a Manifesto&quot; (2012) Epstein contends that the scholarly discipline of the humanities as it exists requires radical, innovative ideas from outside the halls of academic privilege to disrupt stale habits of thought and infuse the humanities with a &quot;proto-global mentality&quot;.

Freed from externally imposed cultural imperatives, humanities programs could expand their scope of research into areas more attuned to the techno-scientific challenges of the twenty-first century. Practical and experimental branches of newly invented fields might include &quot;humanology&quot; (&quot;the ecology of humans and the anthropology of machines&quot;); &quot;ecophilology&quot; (the study of the role of textual environments),  &quot;micronics&quot; (the study of the qualitative meaning of the smallest entities and of the miniaturization of things); and &quot;horrorology&quot;, the study of the self-destructive mechanisms of civilization, which make it susceptible to all forms of terrorism and &quot;horrification&quot;, including its biological and technological forms.

== Possibilism, philosophy, and technology ==
Epstein defines the general direction of his work as the creation of multiple alternatives to the dominant sign systems and theoretical models—what he calls &quot;possibilism&quot;. Along this path, &quot;thinkable worlds&quot; emerge—philosophical systems, religious and artistic movements, life orientations, new words, terms and concepts, new disciplines and forms of humanitarian research. Possibilism assumes that a thing or event acquires meaning only in the context of its possibilities—&quot;may be&quot; as opposed to &quot;is&quot;. The potentiality cannot be reduced to either actuality or necessity. A world consisting solely of actualities would lack meaning and significance. He proposes the discipline of potentiology as a burgeoning branch of metaphysics, one that concentrates on potentiality and complements the established branches of ontology and epistemology.

Expanding his &quot;transformative&quot; and &quot;possibilistic&quot; methodology,  Epstein developed a project of &quot;synthetic&quot;, or constructive philosophy, in contrast to the analytic tradition dominant in modern Western thought. The turning point from analysis to synthesis is the problematization of the elements identified in the analysis, their criticism, replacement, or rearrangement, leading to the construction of alternative concepts and propositions that expand the field of the thinkable and doable. This lays foundation to the synthesis of philosophy and technology,  &quot;technosophia&quot; (the metaphysics applied to the construction of virtual worlds). Technology of the 21st century is not merely instrumental/utilitarian, but a &quot;fundamental&quot; technology (&quot;onto–technology&quot;), which, thanks to science&#x27;s penetration into the micro-  and macrocosm, can change the foundational parameters of being, thereby acquiring a philosophical dimension. Accordingly, philosophy as a study of the general principles of the universe becomes a prerequisite in any &quot;world-forming&quot;, synthesizing acts of technology, including the design of computer games and multi-populated virtual worlds (e.g., &quot;Second Life&quot; and &quot;Meta&quot;), that involve a new ontology, logic, ethics, and axiology. The vocation of philosophy in the 21st century is not just to comprehend our world, but to lay the foundations for new world-forming practices, to initiate and design the ontology of possible worlds, and to pave the way for alternative forms of synthetic life and artificial intelligence. Contrary to Hegel, philosophy is no longer the &quot;owl of Minerva&quot; taking flight at dusk, but a skylark proclaiming the dawn of a new &quot;technosophical&quot; age.

== Projective dictionaries and neologisms ==
Epstein&#x27;s work is often characterized by his use of neologisms and their lexical predecessors, protologisms—neologisms that have not yet been accepted as useful or substantiated additions to the vocabulary. His own term for this process of word-creation is &quot;Lexicopeia&quot;, a literary genre that involves combining specific morphemes into new, meaningful words for previously undefined concepts.

In his &quot;PreDictionary&quot; (Atelos, 2011), Epstein explores the creative potential of neologisms the formative role played by the blank spaces in language. Applying the transformative humanities concept to linguistics, Epstein embraces a shift from analyzing existing language to synthesizing new words that in turn generate new concepts and meanings. For example, one entry in the PreDictionary is &quot;Lexipoem&quot;—that is, a poem consisting of a single word, or lexical unit.

Epstein expanded on this philological—linguistic and philosophical—methodology in a later book, &quot;Proektivnyi slovar&#x27; gumanitarnykh nauk&quot; [A Projective Dictionary of the Humanities] (Moscow: Novoe Literaturnoe Obozrenye, 2017; published in Russian), which brings together over 400 newly coined concepts in the humanities, philosophy, culturology, aesthetics, linguistics, religious studies, and other emerging disciplines. The dictionary contains a systematic description of the concepts and terms of the humanities, covering philosophy (including ethics and aesthetics), cultural studies, religious studies, linguistics, literary studies, as well as humanitarian approaches to nature, history, society, and technology.

== History of Russian philosophy ==
Epstein interrogates the common perception of Russian philosophy as a mere reflection of Western philosophy, with few original ideas to contribute. He views Russia as a philosophical nation in a more fundamental, comprehensive sense: &quot;Perhaps no other nation in the world [has] so totally surrendered its social, cultural, and even economic life to the demands of philosophical concepts.&quot;

Epstein&#x27;s analysis places particular emphasis on two opposing tendencies peculiar to Russian thought and evident throughout the country&#x27;s history. The first tendency uses generalization and unification to transform social and cultural reality, leading eventually to ideocracy and totalitarianism, while the second promotes the unsurpassable value of individuality, revealing the relativity and futility of all general ideological constructs.

The first tendency, developed in the 19th century in various manifestations (&quot;sobornost&#x27;, Vladimir Solovyov&#x27;s &quot;total unity&quot;, the back-to-the-land movement, etc.), lost its inspirational force as it merged with official Soviet ideology. It began to decline in the 1950s and had almost disappeared from philosophy by the late 1980s. The second tendency (including concepts such as personalism, conceptualism, polyphony, and many others) reached the height of its influence in the post-Soviet period. Epstein argues that the contrast and interplay between these two tendencies—generalization, totalitarianism, and utopianism versus individualization, personalism, and conceptualism--define the peculiar character of Russian thought and its contribution to world philosophy.

In his two-volume investigation of Russian philosophy of the late Soviet period (1950s–1980s) Epstein concludes that Russian intellectual history of the 20th century is a history of thought struggling desperately to escape the prison of an ideocratic system created by the strenuous and sacrificial efforts of thought itself. Тhe Russian &#x27;intelligentsia&#x27;, or intellectual elite, opposed &#x27;ideocracy&#x27;, the rule by ideology; yet, the intelligentsia&#x27;s own thinking inadvertently gave rise to ideocracy. This self-defeating cycle of thought not only undermines its own premises but also imparts an unprecedented, paradoxical, and at times tragically sarcastic character to Russian philosophy.&quot;

The second book, &quot;Ideas Against Ideocracy: Non-Marxist Thought of the Late Soviet Period (1953–1991)&quot;, became the cowinner of the Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize for Studies in Slavic Languages and Literatures awarded by Modern Language Association MLA, 2023).

== Current war events in &quot;Russkii Antimir&quot; (Russian Antiworld) (2023) ==
Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in February, 2022 crystalized many of Epstein&#x27;s thoughts on the progression of Russian civilization. In his book &quot;Русский Анти-мир: Политика на Грани Апокалипсиса&quot; (Russian Anti-World: Politics on the Brink of Apocalypse) (2023; published in Russian), Epstein examines the war through a philosophical lens. 

In the book, Epstein states that the Kremlin&#x27;s slogan &quot;Russkii mir&quot; (Russian world), referring to an ever-widening sphere of Russian territory and influence set in opposition to the decadent, &quot;satanic&quot; West, exemplifies a radical ideological rhetoric (including open nuclear threats) not seen even during the Soviet era. Russian politicians and propagandists idealize a mythologized &quot;great empire&quot; of the past (both Tsarist and Soviet) that is incompatible with the modern world. Rather than develop their own civilizational project for Russia, Vladimir Putin and his allies define the &quot;Russian world&quot; only as an &quot;anti-world&quot;: a negation of the West and all it stands for. Epstein believes that in the rhetoric surrounding Russia&#x27;s &quot;special military operation&quot; in Ukraine, the &quot;Russian world&quot; emerges as the antithesis to the modern world; it negates modern ideals such as peace, modern geopolitical norms such as territorial sovereignty, modern notions about the separation of church and state, international humanitarian law; it even inverts conceptual definitions of terms such as &quot;war&quot; and &quot;fascism&quot;.

Epstein defines the ideological framework of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine as &quot;schizofascism&quot;, or &quot;fascism disguised as a struggle against fascism&quot;; &quot;an entire worldview that combines the theory of moral, ethnic or racial superiority, divine mission, imperialism, nationalism, xenophobia, aspiration to superpower, anti-capitalism, anti-democracy, anti-liberalism&quot;.

The intensifying apocalyptic rhetoric of Putin&#x27;s regime permeates Russian culture internally and externally. While the explicit threat of nuclear annihilation at Russia&#x27;s hands hangs over the world, Russian Orthodox church leaders, as part of the state apparatus, preach apocalyptic notions that equate losing Ukraine to the &quot;end of the world&quot;. Epstein interprets these as threats not only against the non-Russian &quot;other&quot; but ultimately, against the Russian people themselves, who are systematically deprived of basic freedoms, factual information, meaningful political choices, material goods, and ultimately their lives, as more and more young men are conscripted to be used as cannon fodder on the battlefield.

<text>Groton is a town in northwestern Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States, within the Greater Boston metropolitan area. The population was 11,315 at the 2020 census. An affluent bedroom community roughly 45 miles from Boston, Groton has a large population of professional workers, many of whom work in Boston&#x27;s tech industry. It is loosely connected to Boston by highways (Route 2) and commuter rail (the MBTA Fitchburg Line).

The town has a long history dating back to the colonial era. It was a battlefield in King Philip&#x27;s War and Queen Anne&#x27;s War, and several Grotonians played notable roles in the American Revolution (including William Prescott, the American commander at the Battle of Bunker Hill) and Shays&#x27; Rebellion. Groton is home to two college-preparatory boarding schools: Lawrence Academy at Groton, founded in 1792; and Groton School, founded in 1884. Notable Groton residents include former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, sports writers Peter Gammons and Dan Shaughnessy, and NBC political correspondent Steve Kornacki.

==History==
=== Early frontier settlement ===
The area surrounding modern-day Groton has, for thousands of years, been the territory of various cultures of indigenous peoples. They settled along the rivers, which they used for domestic tasks, fishing and transportation. Historic tribes were the Algonquian-speaking Nipmuc and Nashaway Indians, who established trails connecting the area to Massachusetts Bay.

The European presence in the era began when John Tinker established a trading post with the Nashaway tribe at the confluence of Nod Brook and the Nashua River. The Nashaway called the area &quot;Petapawag&quot;, meaning &quot;swampy land.&quot; Over the years, more European settlers moved to the area, as it was productive for fishing and farming.

In 1655, the town of Groton was officially settled and incorporated by a group of selectmen including Deane Winthrop. The town was named for Groton in Suffolk, England, the hometown of Deane&#x27;s father, the Massachusetts governor John Winthrop. Called &quot;The Plantation of Groton&quot;, it included all of present-day Groton and Ayer, almost all of Pepperell and Shirley, large parts of Dunstable, Littleton, and Tyngsborough, smaller parts of Harvard and Westford, and the New Hampshire towns of Nashua and Hollis.

During King Philip&#x27;s War, when English colonists and Native Americans tried to destroy each other, on March 13, 1676, Native Americans raided and burned all buildings except for four Groton garrisons. Among those killed was John Nutting, a Groton Selectman. Survivors fled to Concord and other safe havens. Two years later, many returned to rebuild. The rebuilt town was heavily militarized, and recorded a garrison of 91 men in 1692.

In 1694, Abenaki warriors attacked the town again during the Raid on Groton (during King William&#x27;s War). Lydia Longley and two of her siblings were taken captive; the rest of their family was killed. Lydia was taken to Montreal where she was ransomed, converted to Catholicism, and joined the Congregation of Notre Dame, a non-cloistered order.

In 1704, during Queen Anne&#x27;s War, an Abenaki raiding party kidnapped Matthias Farnsworth III from his home and brought him to Montreal.

In June 1707, Abenaki warriors abducted three children of the large family of Thomas Tarbell and his wife Elizabeth (Wood), cousins to the Longleys who were abducted in 1694. The raiders took them overland and by water to the Mohawk mission village of Kahnawake (also spelled Caughnawaga) south of Montreal. The two Tarbell boys, John and Zachariah, were adopted by Mohawk families and became fully assimilated. They later each married chiefs&#x27; daughters, had families, and became respected chiefs themselves. They were among the founders in the 1750s of Akwesasne, after moving up the St. Lawrence River from Kahnawake to escape the ill effects of traders. The brothers&#x27; older sister Sarah Tarbell was ransomed by a French family, and converted to Catholicism. Renamed as Marguerite, she followed Lydia Longley in joining the Congregation of Notre Dame, and served with them for the rest of her life. In the late nineteenth century, a plaque was installed about the Tarbell children at the site of the family&#x27;s former farm in Groton. Descendants with the Tarbell surname are among the Mohawk living at Kahnewake and Akwesasne in the 21st century.

=== Revolutionary era and early republic ===

The townsfolk of Groton supported the Patriot cause in the American Revolutionary War. Following the Boston Tea Party, the town passed a resolution thanking Boston &quot;for their wise, prudent and spirited conduct at this alarming crisis,&quot; and resolved to boycott the tea industry until duties on tea were lifted.

In 1775, local minutemen assembled on the common in front of the First Parish Church of Groton before marching to the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Groton sent 101 men to the battle, but they arrived too late to participate. The American commander at the Battle of Bunker Hill, William Prescott, was born in Groton, and Groton lost 10 or 12 men at the battle, more than any other town.

This patriotic feeling did not last very long, and a majority of Groton residents aligned with the rebels during Shays&#x27; Rebellion. Job Shattuck, a former Continental Army officer and Groton&#x27;s largest landowner, organized an early tax revolt in 1782. He escaped with a fine, but rose up again in 1786 and led a mob that shut down the Middlesex County Courthouse in Concord, Massachusetts. He was captured by a search party that included some pro-government Groton residents. He was sentenced to death but pardoned by Governor John Hancock.
Early Groton developed a strong economy, assisted by its location near the confluence of the Nashua and Squannacook Rivers. By 1790 it was the second-largest town in Middlesex County, with 1,840 residents. Agriculture was the backbone of the economy, but the town also welcomed industry. In the early 1800s, the Hollingsworth family (Hollingsworth &amp; Vose) acquired a paper mill in West Groton. In 1828, miners discovered a large soapstone quarry; Groton eventually hosted the nation&#x27;s largest soapstone factory, which exported products as far away as China. South Groton (Groton Junction, now Ayer) was connected to railroad lines in the 1840s. One line survives as the MBTA Fitchburg Line, the town&#x27;s present-day commuter rail link to Boston.

African-Americans have lived in the area since at least the 1750s, when Primus Lew (father of Barzillai Lew) bought a farm in the area. Private Pomp Phillis was called up to fight at Lexington and Concord. Historian Jeremy Belknap wrote that &quot;a negro man belonging to Groton&quot; fired the shot that killed Major John Pitcairn at the Battle of Bunker Hill.

Starting in the 1840s, Catholic immigrants (mainly Irish, but also some French Canadians) began moving to the Nashoba Valley in large numbers. St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church was established in 1858 to serve the Catholic residents of Ayer. Ayer split off from Groton in 1871, and in 1904, one of the local private schools donated Sacred Heart Church for the use of the Catholics who stayed in Groton proper.

===Economic decline and social unrest===
Groton&#x27;s economic growth slowed in the second half of the nineteenth century. The soapstone quarry shut down in 1868. The town&#x27;s population nearly halved (3,584 to 1,862) from 1870 to 1880, although most of this was due to the 1871 secession of Ayer, which had 1,600 residents in 1870.

In the 19th century and early part of the 20th century, Groton&#x27;s population was largely white and Christian; people have debated whether it was a sundown town. The town became a center of the Second Ku Klux Klan, which was active in Massachusetts in the 1920s. This incarnation of the Klan expressed primarily anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant prejudice, while also opposing racial minorities. Local schoolmaster Endicott Peabody summarized the movement as follows: &quot;There is an astonishing tendency among some of the respectable people in this part of the world to justify [the Klan&#x27;s] existence on the ground that the Jews and Roman Catholics are taking possession of the country.&quot;The Klan held a rally in Groton in September 1924. In 1925, an Irish resident reported a cross burning on Gibbet Hill, not far from Main Street. In October 1926, a group of 400 Klansmen were meeting in a field in the town when they were fired upon with guns used by a group of approximately 100 people opposed to the Klan; the police reported that over 100 gunshots were exchanged between the two groups, but no casualties were reported. In 1927, the local Klan chapter endorsed a full slate of candidates for the town elections, with partial success. The Klan appears to have peaked as an organized force in the area by 1931, when Klan head Hiram Wesley Evans visited West Townsend to implore the remaining Klansmen to rebuild the local chapters. The rate of inter-confessional marriages, which decreased significantly from 1924 to 1928, began rising again starting in 1929.

In 2020, Groton unanimously approved a measure denouncing racial bigotry and advocating equality in recognition of earlier violence and the contemporary social justice movement.

=== Economic revival ===
Starting in the 1950s, the town of Groton enjoyed an economic revival as Boston&#x27;s high-tech sector expanded along the Route 128 beltway. Although Groton does not lie on Route 128, the gravity of the suburban beltway pulled exurban towns like Groton into Boston&#x27;s economic orbit. The town attracted professional workers, and the population expanded rapidly, nearly quadrupling since 1950. (A group led by Marion Stoddart, the wife of one such technology worker, sponsored the cleanup of the Nashua River; previously, the river was so polluted with sludge that on some days, animals could run across it.) In 2021, Groton&#x27;s per capita income ranked 32nd out of 341 towns and cities in Massachusetts. In addition, as of 2015, 31 Groton residents reported incomes over $1 million. Town representatives describe Groton as a &quot;bedroom community&quot; and &quot;a relatively affluent town&quot; where &quot;[m]ost residents are well-educated and hold high-paying professional, managerial, or other office jobs.&quot;

In the 21st century, the town has sought to preserve its rural character and to slow population growth; as of 2017, 42% of the town&#x27;s 32.5 square miles of land was permanently protected from development. In the 2000s, Geotel Communications founder Steven Webber purchased the 338-acre Gibbet Hill Farm to prevent residential development on the site; the town meeting reportedly greeted his intervention with a standing ovation. Town representatives state that they welcome tourists and seek to encourage &quot;a constant trickle rather than a deluge of visitors.&quot; In 2017, the town adopted the motto &quot;All Are Welcome&quot; and placed six waystones engraved with the motto on the major roads entering the town.

Although the town&#x27;s policies have successfully slowed population growth, town amenities have generally improved. Gibbet Hill now hosts a farm-to-table steakhouse. In 2017, the nation&#x27;s largest Shirdi Sai Baba temple opened in Groton; it cost approximately $11 million to build. The 126,000-square-foot Groton Hill Music Center opened in 2022 and includes a 1,000-seat (expandable to 2,300) concert hall, a 300-seat secondary performance hall, a professional orchestra, and a community music school; it was the gift of an anonymous donor, posthumously revealed to be Sterilite owner Albert Stone. The Groton-Dunstable Regional School District is currently building a new $88.4 million campus for its elementary school, which is scheduled to open in 2024. However, the annual per-pupil expenditures in the 2022–23 school year were $19,392.35, just below the state average of $20,133.67, and in April 2024, voters rejected a proposed $7.6 million/3 year tax increase for the school district by a 3-to-2 margin.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Groton has a total area of 33.7 square miles (87.3 km2), of which 32.8 square miles (84.9 km2) is land and 0.9 square miles (2.4 km2) (2.79%) is water.

<text>Central Sulawesi (Indonesian: &quot;Sulawesi Tengah&quot;) is a province of Indonesia located at the centre of the island of Sulawesi. The administrative capital and largest city is located in Palu. The province borders the provinces of Gorontalo to the east, Southeast Sulawesi, South Sulawesi, and West Sulawesi to the south, and sharing maritime borders with East Kalimantan to the west, North Maluku to the east, and Malaysia and the Philippines to the north. 

The 2010 census recorded a population of 2,635,009 for the province, and the 2020 Census recorded 2,985,734, of whom 1,534,706 were male and 1,451,028 were female. The official estimate as at mid 2023 was 3,086,750 (comprising 1,583,650 males and 1,503,100 females). According to BPS (Indonesia&#x27;s Central Statistics Bureau), Central Sulawesi has an area of , but the sum of the area figures submitted by the regencies and city is actually ; in either case, the province has the largest area among all provinces on Sulawesi Island, and has the second-largest population on Sulawesi Island after the province of South Sulawesi. 

It is bordered by the provinces of Gorontalo to the north, West Sulawesi, South Sulawesi and South East Sulawesi to the south, by Maluku to the east, and by the Makassar Strait to the west. The province is inhabited by many ethnic groups, such as the Kaili, Tolitoli, etc. The official language of the province is Indonesian, which is used for official purposes and inter-ethnic communication, while there are several indigenous language spoken by the Indigenous peoples of Central Sulawesi. Islam is the dominant religion in the province, followed by Christianity which is mostly adhered to by the people in the eastern part of the province.

In the 13th century, several kingdoms had been established in Central Sulawesi such as the Kingdom of Banawa, the Kingdom of Tawaeli, the Kingdom of Sigi, the Kingdom of Bangga, and the Kingdom of Banggai. The influence of Islam on the kingdoms in Central Sulawesi began to be felt in the 16th century. The spread of Islam in Central Sulawesi was a result of the expansion of kingdoms in South Sulawesi. The influence that first came was from the Kingdom of Bone and the Kingdom of Wajo. Dutch traders began arriving in the beginning of the 17th century. The Dutch built several fortifications in present-day Parigi to combat piracy in the region after annexing the region as part of the Dutch East Indies. The province remained part of the Indies for the next three centuries until the Dutch were ousted by the Japanese during World War II. After the Japanese surrendered, the area was incorporated into the new Republic of Indonesia. Initially, the area was part of North Sulawesi before being formed as a separate province on 13 April 1964.

According to UNICEF, Central Sulawesi is a province with a significant number of young people. As many as 1 million people or 35 percent of the total population in this province are children. More than three out of four children live in rural areas. More than 185,000 children (18.2 percent) live below the provincial poverty line in 2015 (Rp. 11,127 per person per day). However, more households are in a vulnerable position and live with income that is slightly above the poverty line. In addition, three-quarters of children experience deprivation in two dimensions non-income poverty or more, with that inequality striking between urban and rural areas.

==History==

=== Pre-colonial period ===

There are over 400 granite megaliths in the area of the Lore Lindu National Park, of which around 30 represent human forms. They vary in size from a few centimetres to approximately . The original purpose of the megaliths is unknown. Other megaliths in the area are large stone pots (&quot;Kalamba&quot;) accompanied by stone lids (&quot;Tutu&#x27;na&quot;). Various archaeological studies have dated the carvings from between 3000 BC to 1300 AD.

Central Sulawesi Province has many caves, seven of which have ancient pictures and, based on 2011 research by a joint Indonesian and Australian team, the pictures are known to have been drawn at least 40,000 years ago (about the same age as pictures found in the Caves of Monte Castillo, Spain which are known as the oldest ancient pictures in Europe).

Some of the oldest bronze objects are discovered in Central Sulawesi. The Makassar Axe is a 1st-century AD bronze axes probably used as a valuable object in a ceremony. The Kulawi tribe of Central Sulawesi still practice the exchange of heirloom bronze objects e.g. the taiganja, whose basic form has been discovered throughout the eastern part of Indonesia.

Islam reached the region in the 17th century, shortly after the Islamic avowal of Gowa, the powerful kingdom at the south part of Sulawesi island. Areas along the western coast of Central Sulawesi, from Kaili to Tolitoli, were conquered by the Sultanaete of Gowa around the middle of the 16th century under the leadership of King Tunipalangga. The area around the Gulf of Palu is an important center and trade route, coconut oil producer, and &quot;entrance&quot; to the interior of Central Sulawesi. On the other hand, the Gulf of Tomini area is largely under the control of the Kingdom of Parigi.

With the widespread influence of South Sulawesi, Islam spread to the region Islam first spread to the coastal area of Central Sulawesi. In the middle of the 16th century, two kingdoms, namely Buol and Luwuk, accepted Islamic teachings. Since 1540, Buol has been in the form of a sultanate and led by a sultan named Eato Mohammad Tahir.

=== Colonial era ===
In the beginning of the 17th century, the Dutch started arriving in Central Sulawesi. Under the pretext of securing his fleet from pirate attacks, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) built fortresses in Parigi and Lambunu. Soon afterwards, the region began to fall into the Dutch sphere of influence. In the 18th century, the Dutch forced the kings of Central Sulawesi to come to Manado and Gorontalo to take an oath of loyalty to the VOC. This would mark the beginning of the Dutch colonial rule in the region for the next three centuries.

Initially, the colonial government paid little attention to the region. In 1824, representatives of the Kingdom of Banawa and the Kingdom of Palu signed the &quot;Korte Verklaring&quot; (Short Agreement) with the colonial government. Dutch ships began to sail frequently in the southern part of the Gulf of Tomini after 1830.

By the 19th century, most of the interior part of Central Sulawesi still remained unexplored. In 1860, a government official named Johannes Cornelis Wilhelmus Diedericus Adrianus van der Wyck, managed to visit Lake Poso in 1865 – becoming the first European and Dutch to do so. This step was followed by another government official, Willem Jan Maria Michielsen, in 1869. The proposal to occupy the Poso region was rejected – referring to the anti-expansion policies issued by the colonial government at that time. It was not until 1888 that locals of the region began to establish relations with the government in Batavia through a short agreement signed by kings and local authorities, as an anticipatory measure against the possibility of the spread of British political and economic influence in the region.

During this period, Central Sulawesi was under the jurisdiction of Gorontalo Afdeling, based in Gorontalo. G. W. W. C. Baron van Höevell, Gorontalo Resident Assistant, worried that the strong influence of Islam in Gorontalo would extend to the Central Sulawesi – which at that time the population was mostly are adheres to Animism or other Folk religion. He contacted the Dutch missionary institution, the Nederlandsch Zendeling Genootschap (NZG), and asked them to place a missionary in this area. In 1892, the NZG then sent a missionary named Albert Christian Kruyt, who was stationed in Poso. This step was continued in 1894, when the government appointed Eduard van Duyvenbode Varkevisser, as Controller or government official who would become a supervisor and regional leader in Poso.

In 1905, parts of Poso Regency were involved in guerrilla rebellions against Dutch forces, as part of a coordinated Dutch military campaign to annex entire Sulawesi mainland. One of the famous military campaigns was the &quot;pacification&quot; of the Kingdom of Mori in the Wulanderi War that took place in 1907. At the beginning of the 20th century, movements resisting the Dutch colonial rule started appearing. In addition to local movements, movements also based in Java entered. The first organization to establish a branch in Central Sulawesi was the Sarekat Islam (SI), established in Buol Toli-Toli in 1916. Another organization that developed in this area was the Indonesian National Party (PNI) whose branch was established in Buol in 1928. Other organizations opened branches in Central Sulawesi are Muhammadiyah and Islamic Association Party of Indonesia.

The resistance reached its peak on 25 January 1942. A group of resistance fighters led by I.D. Awuy captured government officials such as Controleur Toli-Toli De Hoof, Bestuur Assistant Resident Matata Daeng Masese, and Controleur Buol de Vries. On 1 February 1942, the Indonesian flag was raised for the first time in Toli-Toli. But this situation did not last long because a week later the Dutch troops staged a counter-attack and recaptured Tolitoli.

=== Contemporary era ===
Japanese forces landed in Luwuk on 15 May 1942. The Japanese succeeded in expelling the Dutch and taking control of Central Sulawesi in just a short time. During the Japanese occupation, people&#x27;s lives were increasingly depressed and the misery of all people&#x27;s activities was only intended to support Japanese warfare. This situation lasted until Japan surrendered to the Allies and was followed by the proclamation of the independence of the Republic of Indonesia. At the beginning of independence, Central Sulawesi was part of the Sulawesi province. The Dutch attempted to return to the region, resulting in a bloody war between the Dutch and the Indonesian. After the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference, the Dutch recognize Indonesia and withdrew from the region.

The present Central Sulawesi was initially part of North Sulawesi with the capital in Manado, but was separated on 13 April 1964.
Between 1999 and 2001 the region has been plagued by inter-religious violence between Muslims and Christians, where over 1,000 people were killed. The Malino II Accord was thus made in 2001. However, riots erupted again in September 2006 on the Christian dominated areas of Central Sulawesi, after the execution by firing squad of three Roman Catholics convicted of leading Christian militants during the violence of the early first decade of the 21st century. The riots appeared to be aimed at government authorities, not Muslims.

In 2010, Abu Wardah, also known as Santoso, declared the formation of the East Indonesia Mujahideen (Indonesian: &quot;Mujahidin Indonesia Timur -&quot; MIT) in the jungles of Poso. He aimed to topple the Indonesian government and create an Islamic State. The group has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Initially, MIT scores victory against the Indonesian government, killing many police and army personnel. In response, the government launched Operation Tinombala, a joint police-armed force operation to destroy the group. Many insurgents were killed or captured during the ensuing operation. Santoso was killed on 18 July 2016 by the Indonesian police after two years of hiding in the jungles near Poso, Sulawesi.

On 28 September 2018, a shallow, large earthquake struck in the neck of the Minahasa Peninsula, with its epicentre located in the mountainous Donggala Regency. The magnitude 7.5 quake was located away from the provincial capital Palu and was felt as far away as Samarinda on East Kalimantan and also in Tawau, Malaysia. The 6.1 magnitude foreshock occurred at 15:00 local time while the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the evening caused severe destruction in Palu city, Donggala Regency and Sigi Regency, destroying hundreds of structures. At least 2,256 people are confirmed dead after the disaster and more than 10,000 others injured, of which 4,612 were seriously injured. More than 70,000 houses are reported to be damaged, forcing tens of thousands of people to live in shelters and tents.

== Geography ==
The northern part of Central Sulawesi borders the Sulawesi Sea and Gorontalo, the eastern part is bordered by Maluku, the southern part is bordered by West Sulawesi and South Sulawesi, the southeastern part is bordered by Southeast Sulawesi, and the western part is bordered by the Makassar Strait.

The equator that crosses the northern peninsula in Central Sulawesi makes the climate of this region tropical. However, it is different from Java and Bali and parts of Sumatra, the rainy season in Central Sulawesi between April and September while the dry season between October and March. The average rainfall ranges from 800 to 3,000 millimeters per year which includes the lowest rainfall in Indonesia.

Temperatures range from 25 to 31 °C for terrain and beaches with a humidity level of 71 to 76%. In mountainous regions temperatures can reach 16 to 22 &#x27;Celsius.

Central Sulawesi also has several rivers, including the Lariang River as a rafting arena, Gumbasa River and Palu River. There is also two lakes that are tourist attractions, namely Lake Poso and Lake Lindu. Central Sulawesi has several conservation areas such as nature reserves, wildlife reserves and protected forests that have unique flora and fauna which are also objects of research for scientists and naturalists.
=== Flora and fauna ===
Sulawesi is a unique border zone in the Asia Oceania region, where the flora and fauna differ greatly from the Asian flora and fauna that stretches across Asia with the Borneo border, also different from the Oceania flora and fauna in Australia to New Guinea and Timor. The virtual line that limits this zone is called the Wallace Line, while the peculiarities of flora and fauna are called Wallacea, because this theory was put forward by Alfred Wallace, a British researcher who helped find the theory of evolution with Charles Darwin.

Sulawesi has its own flora and fauna. The island&#x27;s unique animals are buffalo-like anoa, babirusa which are slightly hairy and have fangs in their mouths, tertiary, Tonkean monkeys, colorful Sulawesi marsupial cuscus which are varieties of marsupials and maleo birds that lay eggs on hot sand.

Sulawesi&#x27;s forest also has its own characteristics, dominated by agatis wood which is different from the Great Sunda which is dominated by areca nut (&quot;Rhododendron&quot; species). The variety of flora and fauna is the object of scientific research and study. To protect flora and fauna, national parks and nature reserves have been established such as Lore Lindu National Park, Morowali Nature Reserve, Tanjung Api Nature Reserve and finally the Bangkiriang Wildlife Reserve.

==Government and administrative divisions==
From its creation in 1964, Central Sulawesi Province was composed of four regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) - Donggala, Buol Toli-Toli (itself recently split off from the northern part of Donggala Regency on 4 July 1959), Poso and Banggai, but on 22 July 1994 the City of Palu was separated from Donggala Regency to be constituted as a regency-level independent city. On 4 October 1999 three additional regencies were created - Morowali from part of Poso Regency, Buol from part of Buol Toli-Toli, and Banggai Islands from part of Banggai Regency. Five further regencies were later created - Parigi Moutong on 10 April 2002 from part of Donggala Regency, Tojo Una-Una on 18 December 2003 from part of Poso Regency, Sigi on 24 June 2008 from part of Donggala Regency, Banggai Sea on 14 December 2012 from part of Banggai Islands Regency, and North Morowali on 12 April 2013 from part of Morowali Regency. Central Sulawesi is thus now divided into twelve regencies and one city (&quot;kota&quot;), which are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2000, 2010 and 2020 Censuses, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.

Notes: (a) The 2000 Census populations for Parigi Moutong Regency and Sigi Regency are included in the figure for Donggala Regency. &lt;br&gt;(b) the province&#x27;s BPS figure for Sigi Regency at the 2020 Census was 257,585 as shown, but the regency&#x27;s BPS own figure for that Census was only 239,421. (c) The 2000 Census population for Tojo Una-Una Regency is included in the figure for Poso Regency. (d) The 2000 Census population for Banggai Laut Regency is included in the figure for Banggai Kepulauan Regency. (e) The 2000 Census population for Morowali Utara Regency is included in the figure for Morowali Regency.

Palu is the provincial capital and the province&#x27;s largest city by far. Other towns include Ampana, Banggai, Bungku, Buol, Donggala, Kolonodale, Luwuk, Parigi, Poso, and Toli-toli.

The province forms one of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Central Sulawesi Electoral District consists of all of the 12 regencies in the province, together with the city of Palu, and elects 7 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

==Demographics==
===Population===
Average annual population growth between 1990 and 2000 was 2.57% and 1.96% from 2000 to 2010.
=== Ethnic groups ===
The indigenous population of Central Sulawesi consists mainly of 19 ethnic or tribal groups, namely:

# in Donggala Regency, Parigi Moutong Regency, Sigi Regency and Palu city
# in Sigi Regency
# in Poso Regency
#Pamona in Poso Regency
# in Morowali Regency
#Bungku in Morowali Regency
# or Loinang in Banggai Regency
#Balantak in Banggai Regency
#Mamasa in Banggai Regency
# in Banggai Regency
# in Poso Regency and Tojo Una-Una Regency
#Banggai in Banggai Islands Regency and Banggai Laut Regency
# in Buol Regency
# in Tolitoli Regency
# in Parigi Moutong Regency
#Dampal in Dampal, Tolitoli Regency
# in Dondo, Tolitoli Regency
#Pendau in Tolitoli Regency
# in Donggala Regency

In addition to these nineteen ethnic groups, there are several tribes living in mountainous areas such as the Da&#x27;a tribe in Donggala and Sigi, the Wana tribe in Morowali, the Seasea tribe and the Taa tribe in Banggai and the Daya tribe in Buol and Tolitoli. Although the people of Central Sulawesi have around 22 languages that differ from one ethnic group to another, people can communicate with each other using the Indonesian Language as a national language and the language of instruction every day.

Besides its indigenous people, Central Sulawesi is also inhabited by transmigrants such as Java, Bali, West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara. The immigrant groups from the southern half of Sulawesi, who also inhabit the area of Central Sulawesi since the early 19th century, are Mandar, Bugis, Makassar, Toraja and other ethnic groups in Indonesia, and have blended in.

=== Language ===
As in other places in Indonesia, Indonesian is the official language used in Central Sulawesi.&lt;ref name=&quot;UU No 24/2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian is used in inter-ethnic communication as well as official documents released by the provincial government as well as road signs. The people of Central Sulawesi have around 22 languages that differ from one ethnic group to another, such as Kaili, Pamona, Banggai, etc. All of these languages fall into the Austronesian peoples subgroup.

===Religion===

Most of the inhabitants of Central Sulawesi practice Islam. Recorded in the 2015 census, 76.37% of the population practiced Islam, 16.58% practiced Protestantism, 4.45% practiced Hinduism, Roman Catholicism as much as 1.85%, and Buddhism as much as 0.74%.

Islam was spread in Central Sulawesi by Datuk Karama and Datuk Mangaji, scholars of West Sumatra; which was then forwarded by Al Alimul Allamah Al-Habib As Sayyed Idrus bin Salim Al Djufri, a teacher at the Alkhairaat school and also proposed as a national hero. One of his grandchildren named Salim Assegaf Al Jufri was a former Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs.

Christianity was first spread in the Poso district and the southern part of Donggala by Dutch missionaries such as Albertus Christiaan Kruyt. Although the majority of the people of Central Sulawesi are Muslim, the level of religious tolerance is very high and a strong spirit of mutual cooperation is part of people&#x27;s lives.
== Culture ==
Central Sulawesi is rich in culture inherited from generation to generation. Traditions concerning aspects of life are preserved in people&#x27;s daily lives. Old beliefs are cultural heritage that are maintained and carried out in several forms with various modern influences and religious influences.

Because many ethnic groups inhabit Central Sulawesi, there are also many differences between these ethnic groups which are harmonious peculiarities in society. Those who live on the western coast of Donggala Regency have mixed with Bugis people from South Sulawesi and the people of Gorontalo. In the eastern part of Sulawesi, there are also strong influences from Gorontalo and Manado, seen from the Luwuk regional dialect and from the distribution of the Gorontaloan people in Bualemo Regency, where it is quite dominant.

There are also influences from West Sumatra as seen in the wedding ceremony decorations. Donggala Regency has a tradition of weaving fabrics inherited from Hindu times. Weaving centers are in Donggala Kodi, Watusampu, Palu, Tawaeli and Banawa. Double tie weaving systems, which are special techniques patterned in Bali, India and Japan, can still be found.

While the mountain tribes has its own culture that is much influenced by the Toraja people in South Sulawesi. However, tradition, customs, clothing models and house architecture are different from Toraja, as an example is that they use banyan skin as body-warmer clothes. The traditional Central Sulawesi house is made of poles and wooden walls that have thatched roofs and only have one large space. Lobo or duhunga is a shared space or hall that is used for festivals or ceremonies, while Tambi is a residence. Apart from the house, there is also a rice barn called Gampiri.

Buya or sarong like a European model, up to the waist and keraba, a kind of blouse equipped with gold thread. The rope or crown on the head is thought to be the influence of the European empire. The banjara shirt embroidered with gold thread is a men&#x27;s shirt that is up to knee length. Silk dressers or sarongs stretching along the chest to shoulders, colorful crowns of heads and machetes slipped around the waist complement traditional clothing.

=== Music ===
Music and dance in Central Sulawesi varies between regions. Traditional music has instruments such as Gongs, kakula, lalove and jimbe. This musical instrument functions more as entertainment and not as part of religious rituals. In the Kaili ethnic area around the west coast – Waino – traditional music – is displayed when there is a death ceremony. This art has been developed in a more popular form for young people as a means of finding partners in a crowd. Many dances come from religious beliefs and are displayed during festivals.

The famous community dance is Dero from the Pamona people, Poso Regency and then followed by the Kulawi people, Donggala Regency. Special dero dances are displayed during the harvest season, guest welcoming ceremonies, thanksgiving and certain holidays. Dero is a dance where men and women hold hands and form a circle. This dance is not an ancestral inheritance but was a habit during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia during World War II. This dance is a traditional dance from Central Sulawesi.

=== Cuisine ===
The typical Central Sulawesi cuisine has its own characteristics, food in Central Sulawesi is known for its spicy taste and sour taste, because the most basic temperament is the result of a lot of nature around Central Sulawesi. The most commonly found fruit is mango. Even though the staple food is the same as most Indonesian people, namely rice, for complementary foods there are various kinds of tubers, papaya, mango, banana and guava.

One of the most famous dish that is originated from Central Sulawesi is &quot;Kaledo&quot;, which originated from Donggala Regency. Kaledo is a traditional cow&#x27;s trotters soup served in spicy broth. This soup is often consumed with steamed rice or sweet potatoes, using the usual utensils that consist of spoon, fork, and occasionally knife; and also additionally using straw, used to sip out the marrow inside of the bones. The broth itself was often served with sliced lime, in order to give sour freshness in otherwise quite oily soup.

&quot;Kapurung&quot; is a dish originated from Palu that is made from sago. The cooked sago is then doused with a yellow sauce made from fish broth, vegetables, mango slices, and shrimp meat. &quot;Milu Siram or&quot; also known as &quot;Binte biluhuta&quot; is corn soup with fish and shrimp which also originated from Palu. &quot;Lalampa&quot; is a typical Palu snack that is similar to lemper. However, the difference is the filling of these foods, &quot;Lalampa&quot; is usually filled with Skipjack tuna. Other typical Palu snacks besides &quot;Lalampa&quot; are &quot;Labia dange&quot; or &quot;sago dange&quot;. This particular snack is made from sago cooked using a skillet and clay furnace. Usually eaten with processed brown sugar or with fish, this food has a savory and crunchy taste.

Central Sulawesi is also famed for its coffee industry. Central Sulawesi consists of 12 regencies and 1 city. Of the 13 autonomous regions, only the city of Palu does not have a coffee plantation. In Central Sulawesi, Sigi and Poso Regencies are areas that have the longest history of coffee. Coffee gardens in this area have been planted since the era of Dutch colonialism. Gradually, the spread of coffee plants expanded to the area of Lore Lindu National Park, Kulawi, Pipikoro, Palolo and the valley around the Poso area. The most productive coffee-producing area is in Poso but the most extensive coffee plantation area is in Sigi. While Donggala does not have a very large area but the coffee produced is also quite a lot. Donggala Regency has local coffee known as Kopi Sojol. This coffee is planted in the mountainous area of 3,226 meters above sea level. This area is suitable for planting arabica type of coffee which usually grows in cool highlands. But overall, Central Sulawesi is a robusta coffee producer. In the town of Pipikoro in Sigi Regency, there is coffee named kopi toratima. This unique coffee is a natural fermented product of bats, rats and squirrels. The difference with kopi luwak is that kopi toratima is not fermented in the digestive system of animals. Because it is traditionally processed, in general Central Sulawesi coffee has a unique taste character. The aroma bursts strong while the taste of the coffee is slightly savory. This special coffee flavor makes the people of Central Sulawesi proud of their local coffee.

Other potentials are spread in Morowali Regency, Bungku Utara District, Bungku Tengah and Bungku Barat. The potential of copper minerals, spread in the Bulagidun area, Bunobogu District, in the Paleleh mountains, with copper ore potential of around 14.4 million tons, and copper metals around 87,840 tons. The next potential of molybdenum found in the mountains west of Malala Village, Dondo Subdistrict, Tolitoli Regency, is in porphyry sediment veins of quartz diorite, with thicknesses varying from 4 to 20 centimeters, at depths above 200 meters. It is estimated that the potential of Molybdenum seeds is around 85 million tons. Other potentials are ironsand, hematite and magnetite blocks, located along the Ulubongka coastline, with rates below 50 percent. This mineral is also found in the titanium-mixed Buol Regency, on the shore of Timbulon Bunobogu-Oyak.

Furthermore, in Morowali Regency, black sand can also be found along the coast of Topogaro, West Bungu Subdistrict with levels between 51 and 69 percent.

<text>Kerry Anne Wells (born 25 September 1951 in Perth) is an Australian fashion designer, writer, commentator, news anchor and beauty queen who was crowned Miss Universe 1972.

The 1972 pageant was the first to take place outside the continental United States. That year, it was held in Dorado, Puerto Rico. Wells was not crowned by her predecessor, Georgina Rizk because Rizk was not able to travel to Puerto Rico due to government restrictions because of fears of a terrorist attacks after a group of Japanese hired by Arab terrorists, attacked the international airport in Tel Aviv and killed twenty-two Puerto Rican tourists. For that reason Wells was crowned by Miss Universe 1970, Marisol Malaret of Puerto Rico.

Her crowning moment was not shown on television because of a strike threat among pageant electricians. The screen blacked out as her name was announced as the new Miss Universe.

Kells was delegated to crown the winner of Miss Universe 1975, due to the suspension of duties by reigning titleholder at the time, Amparo Munoz. 

After her reign, she pursued working as a news anchor. Prior to entering the pageants, she worked as a weather girl.

Wells&#x27;s Miss Universe victory came in a year that Australian women also won the Miss World crown, the Miss Asia Pacific title, and placed second in Miss International. This record was broken by India in the year 2000 where 4 beauty queens, Lara Dutta, Priyanka Chopra, Dia Mirza and Aditi Gowitrikar won Miss Universe, Miss World, Miss Asia Pacific and Mrs. World titles respectively.

, Kerry Anne Wells is a successful fashion designer, writer and commentator who speaks out about positive realistic body image and self-esteem. She is involved with BodyThink, a healthy lifestyle program designed for Australian schools.

<doc id="355462" wikidata="Q464899" url="?curid=355462" title="Monte Albán">
<text>Monte Albán is a large pre-Columbian archaeological site in the Santa Cruz Xoxocotlán Municipality in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca (17.043° N, 96.767°W). The site is located on a low mountainous range rising above the plain in the central section of the Valley of Oaxaca, where the latter&#x27;s northern Etla, eastern Tlacolula, and southern Zimatlán and Ocotlán (or Valle Grande) branches meet. The present-day state capital Oaxaca City is located approximately east of Monte Albán.

The partially excavated civic ceremonial center of the Monte Albán site is situated atop an artificially leveled ridge. It has an elevation of about above mean sea level and rises some from the valley floor, in an easily defensible location. In addition to the monumental core, the site is characterized by several hundred artificial terraces, and a dozen clusters of mounded architecture covering the entire ridgeline and surrounding flanks. The archaeological ruins on the nearby Atzompa and El Gallo hills to the north are traditionally considered to be an integral part of the ancient city as well.

Besides being one of the earliest cities of Mesoamerica, Monte Albán was important for nearly one thousand years as the pre-eminent Zapotec socio-political and economic center. Founded toward the end of the Middle Formative period at around 500 BC, by the Terminal Formative ( – AD 200) Monte Albán had become the capital of a large-scale expansionist polity that dominated much of the Oaxacan highlands and interacted with other Mesoamerican regional states, such as Teotihuacan to the north (Paddock 1983; Marcus 1983). The city lost its political pre-eminence by the end of the Late Classic (–750), and soon thereafter was largely abandoned. Small-scale reoccupation, opportunistic reuse of earlier structures and tombs, and ritual visitations marked the archaeological history of the site into the Colonial period.

The etymology of the site&#x27;s present-day name is unclear. Tentative suggestions regarding its origin range from a presumed corruption of a native Zapotec name to a colonial-era reference to a Spanish soldier by the name Montalbán or to the Alban Hills of Italy. The ancient Zapotec name of the city is not known, as abandonment occurred centuries before the writing of the earliest available ethnohistorical sources.

== Research history ==
Being visible from anywhere in the central part of the Valley of Oaxaca, the impressive ruins of Monte Albán attracted visitors and explorers throughout the colonial and modern eras. Among others, Guillermo Dupaix investigated the site in the early 19th century CE, J. M. García published a description of the site in 1859, and A. F. Bandelier visited and published further descriptions in the 1890s. A first intensive archaeological exploration of the site was conducted in 1902 by Leopoldo Batres, then General Inspector of Monuments for the Mexican government under Porfirio Diaz.

It was not until 1931 that large-scale scientific excavations were undertaken, under the direction of Mexican archaeologist Alfonso Caso. In 1933, Eulalia Guzmán assisted with the excavation of Tomb 7. Over the following eighteen years, Caso and his colleagues Ignacio Bernal and Jorge Acosta excavated large sections within the monumental core of the site. Much of what is visible today in areas open to the public was reconstructed at that time. Besides resulting in the excavation of a large number of residential and civic-ceremonial structures and hundreds of tombs and burials, one lasting achievement of the project by Caso and his colleagues was the establishment of a ceramic chronology (phases Monte Albán I through V) for the period between the site&#x27;s founding in c. 500 BCE to end of the Postclassic period in CE 1521.

The investigation of the periods preceding Monte Albán&#x27;s founding was a major focus in the late 1960s of the Prehistory and Human Ecology Project started by Kent Flannery of the University of Michigan. Over the following two decades, this project documented the development of socio-political complexity in the valley from the earliest Archaic period (c. 8000–2000 BCE) to the Rosario phase (700–500 BCE) immediately preceding Monte Albán. It set the stage for an understanding of the latter&#x27;s founding and developmental trajectory. In this context, among the major accomplishments of Flannery&#x27;s work in Oaxaca are his extensive excavations at the important formative center of San José Mogote in the Etla branch of the valley, a project co-directed with Joyce Marcus of the University of Michigan.

A further important step in the understanding of the history of occupation of the Monte Albán site was reached with the Prehistoric Settlement Patterns in the Valley of Oaxaca Project begun by Richard Blanton and several colleagues from the University of Michigan in the early 1970s. Their intensive survey and mapping of the entire site demonstrated the full scale and size of Monte Albán, beyond the limited area which had been explored by Caso. Subsequent seasons of the same project under the direction of Blanton, Gary Feinman, Steve Kowalewski, Linda Nicholas, and others extended the survey coverage to practically the entire valley, producing an invaluable amount of data on the region&#x27;s changing settlement patterns from the earliest times to the arrival of the Spanish in CE 1521.

==Site history==

As indicated by Blanton&#x27;s survey of the site, the Monte Albán hills appear to have been uninhabited prior to 500 BCE (the end of the Rosario ceramic phase). At that time, San José Mogote was the major population center in the valley and base of a chiefdom that likely controlled much of the northern Etla branch. Perhaps as many as three or four other, smaller chiefly centers controlled other sub-regions of the valley, including Tilcajete in the southern Valle Grande branch and Yegüih in the Tlacolula arm to the east. Competition and warfare seem to have characterized the Rosario phase. The regional survey data suggests the existence of an unoccupied buffer zone between the San José Mogote chiefdom and those to the south and east.

It is within this no-man&#x27;s land that Monte Albán was founded at the end of the Rosario period and it quickly reached a population estimate of around 5,200 by the end of the following Monte Albán Ia phase (c. 300 BCE). This remarkable population increase was accompanied by an equally rapid decline at San José Mogote and neighbouring satellite sites, making it likely that its chiefly elites were directly involved in the founding of the future Zapotec capital. This rapid shift in population and settlement, from dispersed localized settlements to a central urban site in a previously unsettled area, has been referred to as the “Monte Alban Synoikism” by Marcus and Flannery, in reference to similar recorded instances in the Mediterranean area in antiquity.

Although it was previously thought that a similar process of large-scale abandonment, and thus participation in the founding of Monte Albán, occurred at other major chiefly centers, such as Yegüih and Tilcajete, at least in the latter&#x27;s case this now appears to be unlikely. A recent project directed by Charles Spencer and Elsa Redmond of the American Museum of Natural History in New York has shown that, rather than being abandoned, the site grew significantly in population during the periods Monte Albán Early I and Late I (c. 500–300 BCE and 300–100 BCE, respectively). Tilcajete might have actively opposed incorporation into the increasingly powerful Monte Albán state. 
By the beginning of the Terminal Formative (Monte Albán II phase, – CE 200), Monte Albán had an estimated population of 17,200, making it one of the largest Mesoamerican cities at the time. As its political power grew, Monte Albán expanded militarily, through cooption, and via outright colonization, into several areas outside the Valley of Oaxaca, including the Cañada de Cuicatlán to the north and the southern Ejutla and Sola de Vega valleys.(Feinman and Nicholas 1990) During this period and into the subsequent Early Classic (Monte Albán IIIA phase, c. CE 200–500), Monte Albán was the capital of a major regional polity that exerted a dominating influence over the Valley of Oaxaca and across much of the Oaxacan highlands. Evidence at Monte Albán is suggestive of high-level contacts between the site&#x27;s elites and those at the powerful central Mexican city of Teotihuacan, where archaeologists have identified a neighbourhood inhabited by ethnic Zapotecs from the valley of Oaxaca (Paddock 1983). By the Late Classic (Monte Albán IIIB/IV, c. CE 500–1000), the site&#x27;s influence outside and inside the valley declined. Elites at several other centers, once part of the Monte Albán state, began to assert their autonomy, including sites such as Cuilapan and Zaachila in the Valle Grande and Lambityeco, Mitla, and El Palmillo in the eastern Tlacolula arm. The latter is the focus of an ongoing project by Gary Feinman and Linda Nicholas of Chicago&#x27;s Field Museum (Feinman and Nicholas 2002). By the end of the same period (c. AD 900–1000), the ancient capital was largely abandoned. The once powerful Monte Albán state was replaced by dozens of competing smaller polities, a situation that lasted up to the Spanish conquest.

== Monuments ==

The monumental center of Monte Albán is the Main Plaza, which measures approximately 300 meters by 150 meters. The Main Plaza was created through artificial levelling of the mountaintop, being covered in white plaster afterwards. The plaza would have had the capacity to hold the entire population of the city for participation in state-sponsored rituals. The site&#x27;s main civic-ceremonial and elite-residential structures are located around it or in its immediate vicinity. Most of these have been explored and restored by Alfonso Caso and his colleagues.

To the north and south the Main Plaza is delimited by large platforms accessible from the plaza via monumental staircases. On its eastern and western sides, the plaza is similarly bounded by a number of smaller platform mounds, on which stood temples and elite residences, as well as one of two ballcourts known to have existed at the site. A north-south spine of mounds occupies the center of the plaza and similarly served as platforms for ceremonial structures. The majority of the temples faced in the east or west directions, aligning with the sun&#x27;s path. The temples were constructed with a characteristic two-room floor plan: a communal porch situated at the front, connected to a lesser revealed sanctuary at the backend. This collection of sacred venues may have been dedicated to royal ancestors, who acted as supplicants to Cocijo.
One characteristic of Monte Albán is the large number of carved stone monuments throughout the plaza. The earliest examples are the so-called &quot;Danzantes&quot; (literally, dancers), found mostly in the vicinity of Building L. These represent naked men in contorted and twisted poses, some of them genitally mutilated. The figures are said to represent sacrificial victims, which explains the morbid characteristics of the figures. The Danzantes feature physical traits characteristic of Olmec culture. The 19th-century notion that they depict dancers is now largely discredited. These monuments, dating to the earliest period of occupation at the site (Monte Albán I), are now interpreted as representing tortured, sacrificed war prisoners, some identified by name. They may depict leaders of competing centers and villages captured by Monte Albán.(Blanton et al. 1996) Over 300 “Danzantes” stones have been recorded to date, and some of the better preserved ones can be viewed at the site&#x27;s museum. There is some indication that the Zapotecs had writing and calendrical notation.
A different type of carved stones is found on the nearby Building J in the center of the Main Plaza, a building also characterized by its unusual arrow-like shape and an orientation that differs from most other structures at the site. Inserted within the building walls are more than 40 large, carved slabs dating to Monte Albán II. They depict place-names, occasionally accompanied by additional writing and in many cases characterized by upside-down heads. Alfonso Caso was the first to identify these stones as &quot;conquest slabs&quot;, likely listing places which the Monte Albán elites claimed to have conquered and/or controlled. Some of the places listed on Building J slabs have been tentatively identified. In one case (the Cañada de Cuicatlán region in northern Oaxaca), Zapotec conquest there has been confirmed through archaeological survey and excavations.

The site of Monte Alban contains several pieces of evidence, through its architecture, to suggest that there was social stratification within the settlement. Walls ranging up to nine meters tall and twenty meters wide were built around the settlement; these would not only have created a boundary between Monte Alban and neighboring settlements, but also proved the power of the elites within the community. In Scott Hutson&#x27;s analysis of the relationships between the commoners and the elites in Monte Alban, he notes that the monumental mounds found within the site seemed to be evenly spaced throughout the area. The mounds were thus close enough to each house to easily keep them under surveillance. Hutson also notes that, over time, the style of houses seemed to have changed, becoming more private to those living in the buildings and making it harder for outsiders to obtain information about the residents. These changes in the ability of the elites to gain information about the private lives of other citizens would have played a key role in the internal political structure of the settlement.

Many of the artifacts excavated at Monte Albán, in over a century of archaeological exploration, can be seen at the Museo Nacional de Antropologia in Mexico City and at the Museo Regional de Oaxaca, located in the Church of Santo Domingo de Guzmán in Oaxaca City. The latter museum houses many of the objects discovered in 1932 by Alfonso Caso in Monte Albán&#x27;s &quot;Tomb 7&quot;, a Classic period Zapotec tomb that was opportunistically reused in Postclassic times for the burial of Mixtec elite individuals. Their burials were accompanied by some of the most spectacular burial offerings of any site in the Americas.

Monte Albán is a popular tourist destination for visitors to Oaxaca. Its small museum on site displays mostly original carved stones from the site. The site received 429,702 visitors in 2017.

== Threats ==
The primary threat to this archaeological site is urban growth, which is encroaching and &quot;threatening to expand into territories that have potential archaeological value.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICOMOS Heritage at Risk 2001/2002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To complicate matters, the administration of the site is divided amongst four different municipalities, making a unified effort to stop the urban encroachment challenging.

== Architecture ==
Symmetry was not a major concern for the layout of Monte Albán plaza. Although the angles within the plaza are not perfect 90-degree corners, the plaza appears to be a rectangle without actually being so. The structures are not laid out in a symmetrical fashion, as the distances between the structures vary greatly from building to building. Construction methods used for orientation changed as Monte Albán expanded. Early structures, on the western side of the plaza, are rotated south of east, while later structures align more with the cardinal directions.

The exception is the structure referred to as building “J.” This structure is located on the center line of the plaza but it is rotated and does not align with the other structures. It is believed that building “J” had an astronomical relation/ significance. Its steps are aligned perpendicular to the rising of the star of Capella at that time, so that a person looking out a doorway on the building would have faced it directly. Capella is significant as its heliacal rising took place within a day of the Sun passing directly overhead over Monte Albán. In design / construction of the structures, earthquakes were also taken into consideration. Thick walls were often used in construction, as well as sloped sides when constructing tall / larger structures.

Elite residencies were made up of three to four rooms, encompassing an inner patio and sub-patio tomb accessible via stairway. Classical tombs of the elite were walled with stone and often adorned in painted murals. Civilians lived on residential terraces that coated the slopes of the mountain below the Main Plaza. Such residencies were one or two room adobe brick houses with a central, partially enclosed patio.

== Agriculture ==

Monte Albán was not just a fortress or sacred place, but a fully functioning city. The inhabitants had come from the rich agricultural land below Monte Albán and depended greatly on agriculture. Monte Albán became an agricultural center as the area expanded which was developed with structures. The population cultivated the valleys and land up to the crest of the mountain in order to support this growing population.

<text>The southern alligator lizard (Elgaria multicarinata) is a common species of lizard in the family Anguidae. The species is native to the Pacific coast of North America. It ranges from Baja California to the state of Washington and lives in a variety of habitats including grasslands, chaparral, forests, and even urban areas. In dry climates, it is likely to be found in moist areas or near streams. There are five recognized subspecies.

==Subspecies==
The following five subspecies are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies.
*&quot;Elgaria multicarinata ignava&quot; 
*&quot;Elgaria multicarinata multicarinata&quot; 
*&quot;Elgaria multicarinata nana&quot; 
*&quot;Elgaria multicarinata scincicauda&quot; 
*&quot;Elgaria multicarinata webbii&quot; 

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The generic name &quot;Elgaria&quot; is possibly named for an &quot;Elgar&quot; or a pun on &quot;alligator.&quot; The specific name &quot;multicarinata&quot; refers to the keeled scales characteristic of this species. The common name &quot;alligator lizard&quot; is a reference to the fact that the back and belly scales of these lizards are reinforced by bone, as they are in alligators.

The subspecific name &quot;webbii&quot; is in honor of Thomas Hopkins Webb (1801–1866) who was Secretary of the United States and Mexican Boundary Survey (1848–1855). The subspecific name &quot;scincicauda&quot; means &quot;skink tail&quot;.

==Description==

The southern alligator lizard measures from in snout-to-vent length (SVL). Including tail, it can reach a foot in length (30 cm). It has a round thick body with small legs and a long somewhat prehensile tail that can be twice as long as the lizard&#x27;s body. Like many lizards, this species can drop its tail if attacked, possibly giving it a chance to flee. It lives on average 10 to 15 years, and survives well in captivity.

The color of this species is variable, and can be brown, gray, green, or yellowish above, often with red blotches on the middle of the back. Usually there are between 9 and 13 dark crossbands on the back, sides, and tail, with adjacent white spots. These crossbands can be pronounced or covered with reddish or yellowish color.

The scales of &quot;E. multicarinata&quot; are keeled on the back, sides, and legs. There are 14 rows of scales across the back at the middle of the body. A band of smaller granular scales separates the larger scales on the back and stomach, creating a fold along each side of the animal. These folds allow the body to expand to hold food or eggs.

==Geographic range and habitat==
The southern alligator lizard is native to the Pacific coast of North America, ranging from the state of Washington to Baja California. These lizards can be found across many diverse habitats, including grassland, open forest, chaparral, suburban and urban areas, and even into the desert along the Mojave River. This species is particularly common in foothill oak woodlands, and is often found hiding under rocks, logs, or other surface cover.

==Diet==
&quot;E. multicarinata&quot; eats small arthropods, slugs, lizards, small mammals, and occasionally young birds and eggs.

The southern alligator lizard frequently eats western black widow spiders, and has demonstrated an immunity to the spider&#x27;s potent venom.

==Behavior and reproduction==

The southern alligator lizard frequently can be found near human habitation, and is often seen foraging in the mornings and evenings. It is often found in or around suburban yards and garages. &quot;E. multicarinata&quot; is notable for its vicious self-defense, and will bite and defecate if handled.

Mating occurs in spring, typically from April to May, though in warmer regions this species will breed year-round. Eggs are usually laid between May and June and hatch during late summer and early fall. Females lay two clutches of eggs per year, often in decaying wood or plant matter to keep them warm. Females will guard the eggs until they hatch.

<text>Mitla is the second-most important archeological site in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico, and the most important of the Zapotec culture. The site is located 44 km from the city of Oaxaca, in the upper end of the Tlacolula Valley, one of the three cold, high valleys that form the Central Valleys Region of the state. At an elevation of 4,855 ft (1,480 m), surrounded by the mountains of the Sierra Madre del Sur, the archeological site is within the modern municipality of San Pablo Villa de Mitla. It is 24 mi (38 km) southeast of Oaxaca city. While Monte Albán was the most important politically of the Zapotec centers, Mitla became the main religious one in a later period as the area became dominated by the Mixtec.

The name Mitla is derived from the Nahuatl name Mictlán, meaning the &quot;place of the dead&quot; or &quot;underworld.&quot; Its Zapotec name is &quot;Lyobaa&quot;, which means “place of rest”. The name Mictlán was transliterated to Mitla. It was established as a sacred burial site by the Zapotec, but the architecture and designs also show the influence of the Mixtec, who had become prominent in the area during the peak of Mitla settlement.

Mitla is unique among Mesoamerican sites because of its elaborate and intricate mosaic fretwork and geometric designs that cover tombs, panels, friezes, and even entire walls of the complex. These mosaics are made with small, finely cut and polished stone pieces that have been fitted together without the use of mortar. No other site in Mexico has this decorative work.

==History of the site==
Mitla is one of many well-preserved archeological sites in the Oaxaca Valley, where the cold, dry climate has conserved sites as old as 10,000 years. This valley was settled by the Zapotec before the turn of the first millennium, who over the centuries developed a hierarchical society governed by elites. While the valley was relatively isolated, the Zapotec did have contacts with other Mesoamerican peoples. This has been demonstrated by cultural, pottery and other influences that flowed back and forth between other peoples.

By the time the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, the Mixtec had migrated into the area. The mixed Zapotec state had a population of more than 500,000. They had developed and used sophisticated construction techniques, a writing system, two calendar systems, and sophisticated systems of agricultural cultivation. Their basic crops were maize, beans, squash, and chili peppers. These were dependent on their constructed irrigation systems and the use of terraces on mountain slopes in order to grow food for the mostly urban population.

Mitla was inhabited at least since the Classic Period (100-650 CE) and perhaps from as early as 900 BCE. It began as a fortified village on the outer edge of the valley and later became the main religious center of the Zapotec. The Mixtec took control of the area around 1000 CE, although the area remained populated by many Zapotec. The city reached its height and largest size between 750 and 1521, with both Zapotec and Mixtec influences in its architecture during that time.

Mitla is one of the pre-Columbian sites that express the Mesoamerican belief that death was the most consequential part of life after birth. It was built as a gateway between the world of the living and the world of the dead. Nobles buried at Mitla were believed to be destined to become “cloud people,” who would intercede on behalf of the population below.

Mitla was still occupied and functioning as the main religious center when the Spanish explorers and military expeditions arrived in the 1520s and later. The high priest, called the &quot;Uija-tào,&quot; resided at Mitla. At that time the urban center covered an area of , with suburban areas surrounding it. In the rural areas, intensive agriculture was practiced over an area of more than to feed the city.

During the early colonial period, some descriptions of the site were by the Spanish invaders and missionaries who first arrived in the valley. Friar Toribio de Benavente Motolina wrote about the city in the mid-16th century, and was one of the first to do so. He said that its name meant “hell,” his interpretation of the underworld. Another early writer was Diego García de Palacio, a Spanish nautical engineer working in Mexico and Guatemala, whose account was dated in 1576.

In 1553 Oaxacan Archbishop Albuquerque ordered the destruction of the Mitlan site. As the site had long held great political and religious significance for the area, he wanted to dissolve its power. Spanish-directed forces attacked the buildings, dismantling and sacking them, with few buildings spared. Later, Spanish clergy lived in some of the rooms of the sacred site, to displace the Zapotec who had been there before.

The stone blocks and remains were used as building materials for Spanish churches, including the Church of San Pablo, which was constructed on top of part of the ruins. The north side of the Cathedral of Oaxaca incorporates design features from Mitla to symbolize that the old culture was superseded by the new religious order.

In the state of Oaxaca, Mitla is second in importance as an archeological site only to Monte Albán, the central city. At the beginning of the 20th century, the government of Porfirio Díaz chose Mitla as one of the emblematic symbols of pre-Hispanic Mexico for the Centennial celebrations of Mexico’s Independence. Alfonso Caso, the archaeologist who excavated Monte Albán in 1931, also did work at Mitla in the 1920s and 1930s.

Since the 1980s, Mitla has been the site of further excavations, with important work conducted on the North Group. The colonial church was excavated around the start of the 21st century. For Mexico&#x27;s bicentennial celebrations in 2010, INAH has been intensifying efforts to conserve the ancient ruins.

In 2023, the Association for Archaeological Research and Exploration released a review of the previous year of research at the site that is exploring subterranean aspects of the site.

==Description of site==
Rather than being a group of pyramids on a ridge, as is Monte Albán, Mitla is a group of structures built on the valley floor. These valleys are at high elevations in the mountains; it is more than 4500 feet high. The site does not have the far and wide vistas of Monte Albán. The architecture is characterized as more for the comfort of the residents rather than for magnificence. The construction of Mitla as a ceremonial center began in 850CE. The city was fully developed when the Spaniards arrived and brutally destroyed it due to religious zeal in the mid-16th century.

The oldest group of buildings has been dated to between 450 and 700 CE and shows architectural features similar to those found at the earlier Monte Albán. Mitla is one of the few sites that was started in the Classic period, when the Mixtec became dominant in the area. The site represents the most developed architecture of the Zapotec; it is the product of the syncretism of Mixtec and Zapotec design features, which reached its height in 1200. Another syncretism was later expressed by the Catholic churches using Zapotec design features as they built over the foundations by destroying indigenous temples in this area, such as the San Pedro Church, located in the North Group, and the Calvario Chapel, located in the Adobe Group.

The construction of the stone walls appears to have had similar techniques for all groups: a core of mud and stone covered with plaster or well-cut trachyte rock. Some of the large stones, such as those used as columns and lintels, weigh as much as 18 tons. Construction on the site, and acquisition and transportation of such materials, required the complex coordination of large groups of workers.

Today the archeological site consists of five groups of buildings, with a fence of cactus plants surrounding much of it. The five groups are called the South, the Adobe, the Arroyo, the Columns or Palace, and the Church or North Group. All of the groups’ buildings are aligned with the cardinal directions. The South Group and the Adobe Group have been classified as ceremonial centers, featuring central plazas surrounded by mound structures. The South, Columns and Church groups have been classified as palaces, with rooms surrounding square courtyards. The two best preserved groups are the Columns Group and the Church Group, both at the north end of the site.

The Columns Group and the Church Group were both fully excavated and restored by the early 1980s and are open to the public. Both consist of rectangular courtyards surrounded by one-story rectangular buildings, with long, narrow rooms.

===Church Group===

The entrance to the site is by the Church or North Group. In the 16th century, the Spanish built the Church of San Pablo here. It was constructed on top of a large pre-Hispanic platform, which now serves as the church atrium. The Zapotec believed that the lord and lady of the underworld lived in this group of structures. The Spaniards built their church here in turn to emphasize their power and to keep the “devil” from escaping.

The group also contains the main Zapotec temple, called the &quot;yohopàe&quot;, which translates to “house of the vital force.” This temple faces a large courtyard. The portal to the temple is flanked by two large columns, which lead into an antechamber. This antechamber once had a roof, supported by six columns, but only the columns and walls remain. Beyond the antechamber is the main room, where priests burned incense, made sacrifices and performed other rites. Behind the main chamber are the living quarters of the Zapotec priests. Walls throughout this building are covered by intricate mosaic fretwork, and murals depicting mythological scenes and characters.

There are lithic tombs, shaped as a cruciform or cross, under some of the buildings. They are reached by stairs that descend from the patio area. Inside they are decorated with mosaics. One of the tombs has an entrance that is divided by a thick column. This column is popularly known as the &quot;Columna de la Vida&quot; (Column of Life). According to legend, if a person wraps their arms around the column, the space remaining between the hands indicates the amount of life the individual has left.

===Columns Group===

To the south of the Church Group is the Columns Group, whose main building is called the Palace. This group has two entrances to the outside, which face south. The entrance room contains immense columns which support the roof. The north wall has a small opening facing the patio, believed to be used to pass into the afterlife.

The main building is called the Palace or the Grand Hall of Columns. It measures and has six columns of volcanic stone that once supported the roof. After passing through a small corridor, access is gained to the courtyard, which is intricately decorated in mosaic fretwork and geometric designs. The north and east buildings of the group have elaborate tombs where high priests and Zapotec rulers were buried. In front of the stairs of the north building is a cross-shaped tomb with an antechamber. The ceiling has large beams made of stone, and the walls are decorated with tablets and stone fretwork. The east building is characterized by a monolithic stone column that supports the roof.

===Friezes===
The main distinguishing feature of Mitla is the intricate mosaic fretwork and geometric designs that profusely adorn the walls of both the Church and Columns groups. The geometric patterns, called &quot;grecas&quot; in Spanish, are made from thousands of cut, polished stones that are fitted together without mortar. The pieces were set against a stucco background painted red. The stones are held in place by the weight of the stones that surround them. Walls, friezes and tombs are decorated with mosaic fretwork. In some cases, such as in lintels, these stone “tiles” are embedded directly into the stone beam. The elaborate mosaics are considered to be a type of “Baroque” design, as the designs are elaborate and intricate, and in some cases cover entire walls. None of the fretwork designs is repeated exactly anywhere in the complex. The fretwork here is unique in all of Mesoamerica.

==Conservation of the site==
The two main concerns for the Mitla site are the eroding effects of wind, rain etc. and graffiti. The latter, which is mostly painted or etched by visitors, has been a serious problem at least since the early 20th century. To protect the ruins, especially the grecas, shelters have been constructed over a number of the rooms of the Palace or Columns Group. These shelters are palm-thatched roofs supported by wooden beams and columns. They are intended to resemble roofs that were common in the Mesoamerican period. Reconstruction projects planned or underway include, rebuilding the 17th-century wall of a room used as a priests’ residence in the Church Group, laying stucco floors in the Columns Group, sealing of platforms and fortifications walls, and landscaping and the restoration of a colonial-era rainwater collection tank. The last was the only one of its kind built in the valley during the colonial period.

Mitla is one of the sites to be included in a planned program called the Archeology Corridor of Oaxaca Valley (Corredor Arqueológico del Valle de Oaxaca). The government&#x27;s goals are to maintain and restore ruins, as well as to make the site more accessible for visitors. In addition, archeologists such as Nelly Robles have supported efforts to gain recognition of the site, especially as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, because of its importance. It is already listed on Mexico’s list of national heritage sites, called the &quot;Lista Indicativa del Patromonio Nacional.&quot; The Mitla ruins are listed along with the Tree of Tule in the region, and nearby caves that have ancient paintings and show evidence of human habitation for 8,000 years.

==Tourism==
Mitla is the second most visited archeological site in the state of Oaxaca, after Monte Albán. The Mitla site is very important to the modern town of San Pablo Villa de Mitla, as tourist-related activities support most of the economy. Many residents feel that neither the site or the town is promoted sufficiently by the government. Authorities who administer the site say that tourism is rising. Most visitors are Mexicans who visit on weekends from Veracruz and Puebla states. Foreign visitors are mostly European. On average 500 people per day visit the site.

<doc id="355477" wikidata="Q333035" url="?curid=355477" title="Home Run Baker">
<text>John Franklin &quot;Home Run&quot; Baker (March 13, 1886 – June 28, 1963), also known as Frank Baker, was an American professional baseball player. A third baseman, Baker played in Major League Baseball from 1908 to 1922 for the Philadelphia Athletics and New York Yankees. Although he never hit more than 12 home runs in a season and hit only 96 in his major league career, Baker has been called the &quot;original home run king of the majors&quot;.

Baker was a member of the Athletics&#x27; $100,000 infield. He helped the Athletics win the 1910, 1911 and 1913 World Series. After a contract dispute, the Athletics sold Baker to the Yankees, where he and Wally Pipp helped the Yankees&#x27; offense. Baker appeared with the Yankees in the 1921 and 1922 World Series, though the Yankees lost both series, before retiring.

Baker led the American League in home runs from 1911 to 1914. He had a batting average over .300 in six seasons, had three seasons with more than 100 runs batted in, and had two seasons with over 100 runs scored. Baker&#x27;s legacy has grown over the years, and he is regarded by many as one of the best power hitters of the deadball era. During his 13 years as a major league player, Baker never played a single inning at any position other than third base. Baker was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1955.

==Early life==
John Franklin &quot;Home Run&quot; Baker was born on March 13, 1886, to Franklin Adams Baker and Mary Catherine (&quot;née&quot; Fitzhugh) on their farm in Trappe, Maryland. The Bakers, who were of English descent, had been farmers in Trappe for six generations. His mother, of Scottish descent, was reported to be a distant relative of Robert E. Lee.

Baker enjoyed working on his father&#x27;s farm, but he aspired to become a professional baseball player from the age of ten. In Trappe, most of the residents attended the local baseball team&#x27;s games on Saturdays. Frank&#x27;s older brother, Norman, was well known in the town for his playing ability. Norman once tried out for the Philadelphia Athletics, but he did not like that city and stopped pursuing a baseball career.

Baker attended Trappe High School and played for their baseball team as a pitcher and outfielder. He also worked as a clerk at a butcher shop and grocery store owned by relatives.

==Semiprofessional career==
Baker signed with a local semi-professional baseball team based in Ridgely, Maryland, in 1905, at the age of 19. The team, which was managed by Buck Herzog, paid him $5 per week ($ in current dollar terms) and covered his boarding costs. Herzog found that Baker could not pitch well, but that he could hit. Baker was unable to play the outfield well, but he was able to move into the infield as a third baseman for Ridgely.

In 1906, Baker played for Sparrows Point Club in Baltimore, earning $15 per week ($ in current dollar terms). He received an offer to play for a team in the Class C Texas League in 1907, which he turned down. He instead signed with an independent team based in Cambridge, Maryland.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
A scout for the New York Giants of the National League noticed Baker while he was playing for Sparrows Point. They arranged for Baker to receive a tryout with the Baltimore Orioles of the Class A Eastern League late in the 1907 season. Playing in five games, Baker recorded two hits, both singles, in 15 at-bats. Orioles&#x27; manager Jack Dunn decided that Baker &quot;could not hit&quot;, and Baker was released.

In 1908, Baker began the season with the Reading Pretzels of the Class B Tri-State League. He had a .299 batting average in 119 games played, adding six home runs, 65 runs scored, and 23 stolen bases.
===Philadelphia Athletics (1908–1914)===
Connie Mack, the manager of the Philadelphia Athletics, purchased Baker&#x27;s contract in September 1908. In nine games, Baker batted .290 in 31 at-bats to close the 1908 season. Mack named Baker his starting third baseman for the 1909 season. That year, Mack established his &quot;$100,000 infield&quot;, with Baker joined by first baseman Stuffy McInnis, second baseman Eddie Collins, and shortstop Jack Barry. He hit .305 with a .447 slugging percentage and four home runs for Philadelphia in 1909, including the first home run to go over the fence in right field of Shibe Park. His slugging percentage was fourth best in the American League, while his 85 runs batted in (RBIs) were third-best, and his 19 triples led the league. The Athletics improved by 27 wins over their 1908 record in 1909, but finished in second place behind the Detroit Tigers.

In a late season series against the Tigers in 1909, Ty Cobb spiked Baker while sliding into third base, lacerating Baker&#x27;s arm. Baker referred to the spiking as &quot;deliberate&quot; on the part of Cobb, while Mack called Cobb the dirtiest player he had seen, and asked American League president Ban Johnson to investigate. A photograph taken for &quot;The Detroit News&quot; vindicated Cobb, by showing that Baker had to reach across the base to reach Cobb. Though Baker remained in the game after wrapping his arm, he acquired a reputation for being weak and easily intimidated. Joe S. Jackson, a sportswriter for the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, referred to Baker as a &quot;soft-fleshed darling&quot;.

In the 1910 season, Baker led the American League with 11 home runs in , and batted .344. Baker helped the Athletics win the 1910 World Series over the Chicago Cubs, four games to one, as he batted .409 in the five-game series.

In the 1911 World Series, the Athletics faced off against the Giants. Based on Baker&#x27;s past run-in with Cobb, Giants players believed they could intimidate him. Fred Snodgrass spiked Baker while sliding into third base in Game One, knocking the ball loose and requiring Baker to bandage his arm. In Game Two, Baker hit a go-ahead home run off Rube Marquard for an Athletics win. He hit a ninth-inning game-tying home run off Christy Mathewson in Game Three. Later in the game Snodgrass again attempted to spike Baker, but he was able to hold onto the ball and the Athletics won again. A six-day delay between games as a result of rain, which turned Shibe Park into a &quot;virtual quagmire&quot;, allowed Baker&#x27;s feats to be magnified by the Philadelphia press, during which time he began to be referred to by the nickname &quot;Home Run&quot;. The Athletics defeated the Giants in six games, as Baker led the Athletics with a .375 batting average, nine hits and five RBIs in the series.

Baker again led the American League in home runs in 1912, and led the league with 130 RBIs as well. But his Athletics finished in third place, and the Boston Red Sox defeated the Giants in an exciting eight-game World Series. In 1913, he again led the league with 12 home runs and 117 RBIs, but this time the Athletics defeated the Giants in the World Series, as Baker batted .450 with a home run and seven RBIs in the five games. He led the league in home runs for a fourth consecutive season in 1914, with nine, despite suffering from pleurisy during the season. He also batted .319 and added 89 RBIs, 10 triples and 19 stolen bases. Late in the season, Mack sent Baker, Collins and pitcher Chief Bender to scout the Boston Braves, their opponent in the 1914 World Series. Despite predictions that Philadelphia would win the series handily, the Braves defeated the Athletics four games to none, as Baker batted only .250.

After the 1914 World Series, Mack began to sell off some of his best players not including Collins, to whom he had given a multiyear contract during the regular season to prevent him from jumping to the upstart Federal League. Baker, who had just completed the first year of a three-year contract, attempted to renegotiate his terms, but Mack refused. Baker sat out the entire 1915 season as a result of this contract dispute. He remained in baseball, playing for a team representing Upland, Pennsylvania, in the semi-professional Delaware County League.

===New York Yankees (1916–1919, 1921–1922)===

Pressured by American League president Ban Johnson, Mack sold Baker&#x27;s contract in to the New York Yankees for $35,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Even though Baker reported to the Yankees with an injured finger, and he injured his knee during a game in May, he and Wally Pipp combined to form the center of the Yankees&#x27; batting order. Pipp led the American League in home runs with 12 in 1916; Baker finished second with 10, despite missing almost a third of the Yankees&#x27; games. Pipp hit nine home runs in 1917, again leading the league. Baker led the league with 141 games played in the season. The Yankees hit a league-leading 47 home runs that year, of which Baker hit ten. Sports cartoonist Robert Ripley, working for the &quot;New York Globe&quot; coined the term &quot;Murderer&#x27;s Row&quot; to refer to the lineup of Baker, Pipp, Roger Peckinpaugh, and Ping Bodie.

Baker sat out of baseball during the 1920 season, as his wife died of scarlet fever. His two daughters were also affected, but they were able to recover. Late in the 1920 season, Baker again played for Upland, and stated his desire to return to New York. He rejoined the Yankees in 1921, as the Yankees reached the World Series for the first time in franchise history. Missing the last six weeks of the 1921 season, Yankees&#x27; manager Miller Huggins started Mike McNally in his place. In the 1921 World Series, a best-of-nine series, Huggins opted to start McNally over Baker, though he wanted to be sure to take advantage of Baker&#x27;s World Series experience. The Giants defeated the Yankees five games to three; Baker played in only four of the eight games, though McNally struggled to a .200 batting average.

In the 1922 season, Baker played in 66 games. Overshadowed by Babe Ruth as a home run hitter, Baker complained about the &quot;rabbit ball&quot;, saying that the ball being used traveled much further than the ball used for the majority of his career. The Yankees again faced the Giants in the World Series, losing four games to none. Baker received only one at bat in the 1922 World Series. He finished his career as a Yankee with a .288 batting average, 48 home runs and 379 RBIs in 676 games.

==Managerial career==
Following his retirement as a player, Baker managed the Easton Farmers of the Eastern Shore League during the 1924 and 1925 seasons. He was credited with discovering Jimmie Foxx and recommending him to Mack. After Baker sold Foxx to the Athletics, the Farmers fired Baker, because they believed Mack did not pay a high enough price for Foxx.

==Personal life==
Baker was a modest man who never drank, smoked, or swore. He returned to his Maryland farm every offseason, where he enjoyed duck hunting. While playing in Cambridge, Baker met Ottilie Tschantre, the daughter of a Swiss jeweler. They were married on November 12, 1909.

Baker and his wife had twin babies in late January 1914. The babies were reported as doing well a couple of days later, but they died before they were two weeks old. The twins were initially reported as being a boy and a girl by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, but they were reported as twin girls by the same publication a few days later. After the 1919 season, his wife contracted scarlet fever and died. He remarried, to Margaret Mitchell, after leaving the Yankees.

In addition to working on his farm, Baker served Trappe as a member of the Trappe Town Board, a tax collector, and a volunteer firefighter. He was also a director of the State Bank of Trappe. In 1924 Baker intervened to stop the lynching of a black man in Easton, Maryland who had assaulted Baker&#x27;s sister-in-law.

On June 28, 1963, Baker died about two weeks after having a stroke. He was survived by his wife and two children from each of his two marriages. He was interred in Spring Hill Cemetery in Easton, Maryland.

==Legacy==

Though nicknamed &quot;Home Run&quot;, Baker hit only 96 home runs in his career, and never more than 12 in a season as he played during the dead ball era. Walter Johnson referred to Baker as &quot;the most dangerous batter I ever faced.&quot;

Baseball historian Bill James rated the 1914 edition of the $100,000 infield as the greatest infield of all time, and also ranked the 1912 and 1913 editions in the top five of all time.

In 1955, the Veterans Committee elected Baker into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the baseball hall of fame for Reading, Pennsylvania. Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their 1981 book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. In his 2001 book &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, Bill James ranked Baker the 70th greatest player of all time and the 5th greatest third baseman.

Home Run Baker Park in his hometown of Trappe is named for him.

<doc id="355478" wikidata="Q311019" url="?curid=355478" title="Boris Berezovsky (businessman)">
<text>Boris Abramovich Berezovsky (, ; 23 January 1946 – 23 March 2013), also known as Platon Elenin, was a Russian business oligarch, government official, engineer and mathematician and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He had the federal state civilian service rank of 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation.

Berezovsky made his fortune in early post-soviet Russia in the 1990s, when the country implemented privatization of state property. He profited from gaining control over assets, including the country&#x27;s main television channel, Channel One. In 1997, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Berezovsky&#x27;s wealth at US$3 billion. Berezovsky helped fund Unity, the political party that would form Vladimir Putin&#x27;s first parliamentary base, and was elected to the Duma in the 1999 Russian legislative election. However, following the Russian presidential election in March 2000, Berezovsky went into opposition and resigned from the Duma. Berezovsky would remain a vocal critic of Putin for the rest of his life.

In late 2000, after the Russian Deputy Prosecutor General demanded that Berezovsky appear for questioning, he did not return from abroad and moved to the United Kingdom, which granted him political asylum in 2003. After he moved to Britain, the Russian government took over his television assets, and he divested from other Russian holdings. In Russia, Berezovsky was later convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; of fraud and embezzlement. The first charges had been brought during Primakov&#x27;s government in 1999. Despite an Interpol Red Notice for Berezovsky&#x27;s arrest, Russia repeatedly failed to obtain the extradition of Berezovsky from Britain; the situation became a major point of diplomatic tension between the two countries.

In late 2011, an Israeli private investigator ordered the mercenary Indian hack-for-hire firm Appin to hack Berezovsky and his lawyers. In 2012, Berezovsky lost a London High Court case he brought over the ownership of the major oil producer Sibneft, against Roman Abramovich, in which he sought over £3 billion in damages. The court concluded that Berezovsky had never been a co-owner of Sibneft.

Berezovsky was found dead in his home, Titness Park, at Sunninghill, near Ascot in Berkshire, on 23 March 2013. A post-mortem examination found that his death was consistent with hanging and that there were no signs of a violent struggle. However, the coroner at the inquest into Berezovsky&#x27;s death later recorded an open verdict.

==Early life, scientific research and engineering experience==
Boris Abramovich Berezovsky was born in 1946, in Moscow, to Abram Markovich Berezovsky (1911–1979), an Ashkenazi Jewish civil engineer in construction works, and his wife, Anna Aleksandrovna Gelman (22 November 1923 – 3 September 2013). He studied applied mathematics, receiving his doctorate in 1983. After graduating from the Moscow Forestry Engineering Institute in 1968, Berezovsky worked as an engineer from 1969 until 1987, serving as assistant research officer, research officer and finally the head of a department in the Institute of Control Sciences of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Berezovsky researched optimization and control theory, publishing 16 books and articles between 1975 and 1989. After graduation, he got a job by distribution. Berezovsky later stated that he disliked his initial job, although appreciated his academic entourage that &quot;shaped his personality&quot;.

As a member of the Communist Party, he did not act as a political dissident. Yet, he disagreed with the official ideology, and sought to exploit his membership for career growth, that helped him to &quot;intuitively compensate&quot; lack of scientific talent.

==Political and business career in Russia==
===Accumulation of wealth===
Alexander Khinshtein (State Duma deputy, member of the United Russia faction) claimed that in 1979 Boris Berezovsky was detained by the OBKhSS authorities in Makhachkala (Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic) for profiteering. In Khinshtein&#x27;s opinion, Berezovsky has been a KGB officer since 1979.

In 1989, Berezovsky took advantage of the opportunities presented by perestroika to found LogoVAZ with Badri Patarkatsishvili and senior managers from Russian automobile manufacturer AvtoVAZ. LogoVAZ developed software for AvtoVAZ, sold Soviet-made cars and serviced foreign cars. The dealership profited from hyperinflation by taking cars on consignment and paying the producer at a later date when the money lost much of its value.

One of Berezovsky&#x27;s early endeavors was All-Russia Automobile Alliance (AVVA), a venture fund he formed in 1993 with Alexander Voloshin (Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s future Chief of Staff) and AvtoVAZ Chairman Vladimir Kadannikov. Berezovsky controlled about 30% of the company, which raised nearly US$50 million from small investors through a bonded loan to build a plant producing a &quot;people&#x27;s car&quot;. The project did not collect sufficient funds for the plant and the funds were instead invested into AvtoVAZ production, while the debt to investors was swapped for equity. By 2000, AVVA held about one-third of AvtoVAZ.

In 1994, Berezovsky was the target of a car bombing incident, but survived the assassination attempt, in which his driver was killed and he himself was injured. Alexander Litvinenko led the FSB investigation into the incident and linked the crime to the resistance of the Soviet-era AvtoVaz management to Berezovsky&#x27;s growing influence in the Russian automobile market.

Berezovsky&#x27;s involvement in the Russian media began in December 1994, when he gained control over ORT Television (see Channel One (Russia)) to replace the failing Soviet TV Channel 1. He appointed the popular anchorman and producer Vladislav Listyev as CEO of ORT. Three months later Listyev was assassinated amid a fierce struggle for control of advertising sales. Berezovsky was questioned in the police investigation, among many others, but the killers were never found.

Under Berezovsky&#x27;s stewardship, ORT became a major asset of the reformist camp as they prepared to face Communists and nationalists in the upcoming presidential elections.

From 1995 to 1997, through the controversial loans-for-shares privatisation auctions, Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili assisted Roman Abramovich in acquiring control of Sibneft, the sixth-largest Russian oil company, which constituted the bulk of his wealth. In an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2000, Berezovsky revealed that financier George Soros declined an invitation to participate in the acquisition.

In 1995, he played a key role in a management reshuffle at Aeroflot and participated in its corporatization, with his close associate Nikolai Glushkov becoming Aeroflot&#x27;s CFO. In January 1998, it was announced that Sibneft would merge with Mikhail Khodorkovsky&#x27;s Yukos to create the third-largest oil company in the world. The merger was abandoned five months later amid falling oil prices.

===Role in Yeltsin&#x27;s reelection in 1996===

Berezovsky entered the Kremlin&#x27;s inner circle in 1993 through arranging for the publication of Yeltsin&#x27;s memoirs and befriended Valentin Yumashev, the President&#x27;s ghost-writer.

In January 1996, at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Berezovsky liaised with fellow oligarchs to form an alliance – which later became known as the &quot;Davos Pact&quot; – to bankroll Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s campaign in the upcoming presidential elections. On his return to Moscow, Berezovsky met and befriended Tatyana Dyachenko, Yeltsin&#x27;s daughter, According to a later profile by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Berezovsky masterminded the 1996 re-election of Boris Yeltsin... He and his billionaire friends coughed up £140 million for Yeltsin&#x27;s campaign&quot;.

In the summer of 1996, Berezovsky had emerged as a key advisor to Yeltsin, allied with Anatoly Chubais, opposing a group of hardliners led by General Alexander Korzhakov. One night in June, in the drawing room of Club Logovaz, Berezovsky, Chubais and others plotted the ouster of Korzhakov and other hardliners. On 20 June 1996, Yeltsin fired Korzhakov and two other hawks, leaving the reformers&#x27; team in full control of the Kremlin. Firing them was controversial though, as Korzhakov a few days before caught two of Yeltsin&#x27;s campaign organizers carrying US$500,000 cash without invoices out of the presidential administration building.

On 16 June 1996, Yeltsin came first in the first round of elections after forging a tactical alliance with Gen. Alexander Lebed, who finished third. On 3 July, in the runoff vote, he beat the Communist Gennady Zyuganov. His victory was due largely to the support of the TV networks controlled by Gusinsky and Berezovsky (NTV and ORT) and the money from the business elite. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Berezovsky the &quot;public spokesman and chief lobbyist for this new elite, which moved from the shadows to respectability in a few short years&quot;.

===Role in Chechen conflict===
On 17 October 1996, Yeltsin dismissed General Alexander Lebed from the position of National Security Advisor amid allegations that he was plotting a coup and secretly mustering a private army. Lebed promptly accused Berezovsky and Gusinsky of engineering his ouster, and formed a coalition with the disgraced General Alexander Korzhakov. The dismissal of Lebed, the architect of the Khasavyurt peace accord, left Yeltsin&#x27;s Chechen policy in limbo. On 30 October 1996, in a political bombshell, Yeltsin named Ivan Rybkin as his new National Security Advisor and appointed Berezovsky Deputy Secretary in charge of Chechnya with a mandate to oversee the implementation of the Khasavyurt Accord: that is, the withdrawal of Russian forces, the negotiation of a peace treaty, and the preparation of a general election. On 19 December 1996, Berezovsky made headlines by negotiating the release of 21 Russian policeman held hostage by the warlord Salman Raduev amid efforts by radicals from both sides to torpedo peace negotiations.

On 12 May 1997, Yeltsin and Maskhadov signed the Russian–Chechen Peace Treaty in the Kremlin. Speaking at a press conference in Moscow, Berezovsky outlined his priorities for the economic reconstruction of Chechnya, particularly the construction of a pipeline for transporting Azerbaijani oil. He called upon the Russian business community to contribute to the rebuilding of the republic, revealing his own donation of US$1 million (some sources mention US$2 million) for a cement factory in Grozny. This payment would come to haunt him years later, when he was accused of funding Chechen terrorists.

After his dismissal from the Security Council, Berezovsky vowed to continue his activities in Chechnya as a private individual and maintained contact with Chechen warlords. He was instrumental in the release of 69 hostages, including two Britons, Jon James and Camilla Carr, whom he flew in his private jet to RAF Brize Norton in September 1998. In an interview with Thomas de Waal in 2005, he revealed the involvement of the British Ambassador to Russia, Sir Andrew Wood, and explained that his former negotiations counterpart, the Islamic militant leader Movladi Udugov, helped arrange the Britons&#x27; release.

Berezovsky had a phone conversation with Movladi Udugov in the spring of 1999, six months before the beginning of fighting in Dagestan. A transcript of that conversation was leaked to a Moscow tabloid on 10 September 1999 and appeared to mention the would-be militants&#x27; invasion. It has been the subject of much speculation ever since. As Berezovsky explained later in interviews to de Waal and Goldfarb, Udugov proposed to coordinate the Islamists&#x27; incursion into Dagestan, so that a limited Russian response would topple the Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov and establish a new Islamic republic, which would be anti-American but friendly to Russia. Berezovsky said that he disliked the idea but reported Udugov&#x27;s overture to prime-minister Stepashin. &quot;Udugov and Basayev,&quot; he asserted, &quot;conspired with Stepashin and Putin to provoke a war to topple Maskhadov ... but the agreement was for the Russian army to stop at the Terek River. However, Putin double-crossed the Chechens and started an all-out war.&quot;

===Battle with &quot;Young Reformers&quot;===
In March 1997, Berezovsky and Tatyana Dyachenko flew to Nizhniy Novgorod to persuade the city&#x27;s governor, Boris Nemtsov, to join Chubais&#x27; economic team, which became known as the government of Young Reformers. This was the last concerted political action of the &quot;Davos Pact&quot; (see above). Four months later the group split into two cliques fiercely competing for Yeltsin&#x27;s favour. The clash was precipitated by the privatization auction of the communication utility Svyazinvest, in which Onexim bank of Chubais&#x27; loyalist Vladimir Potanin, backed by George Soros, competed with Gusinsky, allied with Spanish Telefónica. An initially commercial dispute swiftly developed into a contest of political wills between Chubais and Berezovsky.

Potanin&#x27;s victory unleashed a bitter media war, in which ORT and NTV accused the Chubais group of fixing the auction in favor of Potanin, whereas Chubais charged Berezovsky with abusing his government position to advance his business interests. Both sides appealed to Yeltsin, who had proclaimed a new era of &quot;fair&quot; privatization &quot;based on strict legislative rules and allowing no deviations&quot;. In the end, both sides lost. Berezovsky&#x27;s media revealed a corrupt scheme whereby a publishing house owned by Onexim Bank paid Chubais and his group hefty advances for a book that was never written. The scandal led to a purge of Chubais&#x27; loyalists from the government. Chubais retaliated by persuading Yeltsin to dismiss Boris Berezovsky from the national security council. Berezovsky&#x27;s service on the Security Council ended on 5 November 1997. Soros called the Berezovsky-Chubais clash a &quot;historical event, in the reality of which I would have never believed, if I had not watched it myself. I saw a fight of the people in the boat floating towards the edge of a waterfall&quot;. He argued that the reformist camp never recovered from the wounds sustained in this struggle, setting the political stage for conservative nationalists, and eventually Vladimir Putin.

===Philanthropy===
In 1991, Berezovsky founded the &quot;Triumph&quot; award, bestowed upon outstanding Russian poets, musicians, artists, directors and ballet dancers.

It is reported in the documentary series Captive that Boris Berezovsky, in 1998, was effective in the release of two English aid workers who had been held hostage for ransom in Chechnya for 14 months

===The Kremlin Family and Putin&#x27;s rise to power===
In the spring of 1998, Berezovsky made an unexpected political comeback, starting with his appointment, in April 1998, to the position of executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States. He emerged in the centre of a new informal power group – the &quot;Family&quot;, a close-knit circle of advisers around Yeltsin, which included Yeltsin&#x27;s daughter Tatyana and his chief of staff, Yumashev. It was rumoured that no important government appointment could happen without the Family&#x27;s support. By 1999, the Family also included two of Berezovsky&#x27;s associates, his former AVVA partner Alexander Voloshin, who replaced Yumashev as Yeltsin&#x27;s chief of staff, and Roman Abramovich.

The principal concern of the Family was finding an &quot;electable&quot; successor to Yeltsin to counter the presidential aspirations of the then–prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, who was leaning to more statist positions. Political battles between the Family and Primakov&#x27;s camp dominated the two last years of Yeltsin&#x27;s presidency.

In November 1998, in a televised press conference, five officers of the FSB, led by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Litvinenko, revealed an alleged plot by their superiors to assassinate Berezovsky.

In April 1999, Russia&#x27;s Prosecutor General, Yury Skuratov, opened an investigation into embezzlement at Aeroflot and issued an arrest warrant for Berezovsky, who called the investigation politically motivated and orchestrated by Primakov. Nikolai Glushkov, Aeroflot&#x27;s former General Director, later revealed that conflict with Primakov arose from the irritation that Berezovsky&#x27;s management team caused in the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, which Primakov headed before becoming prime minister, over firing of thousands of spies, who used Aeroflot as a front organization in Soviet times. The arrest warrant was dropped a week later, after Berezovsky submitted to questioning by the prosecutors. No charges were brought. Yeltsin sacked Primakov&#x27;s government shortly thereafter and replaced him with Sergey Stepashin as new prime-minister.

Vyacheslav Aminov () supported Berezovsky and headed Berezovsky&#x27;s security service.

Vladimir Putin&#x27;s meteoric rise from relative obscurity to the Russian presidency in the course of a few short months of 1999 has been attributed to his intimacy with the &quot;Family&quot; as a protege of Berezovsky and Yumashev. By the end of 1999, the Family had persuaded Yeltsin to name Putin his political successor and candidate for the presidency.

Berezovsky&#x27;s acquaintance with Putin dated back to the early 1990s, when the latter, as Deputy Mayor of St. Petersburg, helped Logovaz establish a car dealership. They enjoyed friendly relations; on occasion, Berezovsky took Putin skiing with him in Switzerland.

In February 1999, when Berezovsky&#x27;s political standing looked uncertain because of his clash with Primakov over Aeroflot, Putin, then Director of the FSB, made a bold gesture of friendship by showing up at a birthday party for Berezovsky&#x27;s wife. &quot;I absolutely do not care what Primakov thinks of me&quot;, Putin told Berezovsky on that night. That was the beginning of their political alliance. According to the Times, Spanish police discovered that on up to five occasions in 1999, Putin had secretly visited a villa in Spain belonging to Berezovsky.

In mid-July 1999, the Family dispatched Berezovsky to Biarritz, where Putin was vacationing, to persuade him to accept the position of prime minister and the role of heir apparent. On 9 August, Yeltsin sacked the government of Sergei Stepashin and appointed Putin prime minister, amid reports that Berezovsky had masterminded the reshuffle.

Putin&#x27;s principal opponents were the former Prime Minister Evgeny Primakov and the Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, backed by the Fatherland-All Russia alliance. To counter this group in the Duma elections of 1999, Berezovsky was instrumental in the creation, within the space of a few months, of the Unity party, with no ideology other than its support for Putin. Later, he disclosed that the source of Unity&#x27;s funding, with Putin&#x27;s knowledge and consent, was Aeroflot. In the 1999 election, Berezovsky campaigned as a Putin loyalist and won a seat in the Duma, representing the North Caucasian republic of Karachaevo-Cherkessia.

During the Duma election campaign Berezovsky&#x27;s ORT TV served as an extremely effective propaganda machine for the Putin camp, using aggressive attack reporting and programming to denigrate and ridicule Putin&#x27;s rivals, Primakov and Luzhkov, tactics strongly criticized as undue interference with the media. But Unity got a surprisingly high score in the elections, paving the way for Putin&#x27;s election victory in spring 2000.

===Conflict with Putin and emigration===
Berezovsky&#x27;s disagreements with Putin became public three weeks into Putin&#x27;s presidency. On 8 May 2000, Berezovsky and Abramovich were spotted together at Putin&#x27;s invitation-only inauguration ball in Moscow. However, on 31 May, Berezovsky sharply attacked the constitutional reform proposed by the president, which would give the Kremlin the right to dismiss elected governors. On 17 July 2000, Berezovsky resigned from the Duma, saying he &quot;did not want to be involved in the country&#x27;s ruin and the restoration of an authoritarian regime&quot;. In August, Berezovsky&#x27;s media attacked Putin for the way he handled the sinking of the &quot;Kursk&quot; submarine, blaming the death of 118 sailors on the Kremlin&#x27;s reluctance to accept foreign help. In September, Berezovsky alleged that the Kremlin had attempted to expropriate his shares in ORT and announced that he would put his stake into a trust to be controlled by prominent intellectuals.

In an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2000, Berezovsky argued that in the absence of a strong civil society and middle class it may sometimes be necessary for capitalists &quot;to interfere directly in the political process&quot; of Russia as a counterweight to ex-Communists &quot;who hate democracy and dream of regaining lost positions.&quot; Berezovsky took legal action against the journalist Paul Klebnikov, who accused him of various crimes. In October, in an interview in &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, Putin announced that he would no longer tolerate criticism of the government by media controlled by the oligarchs. &quot;If necessary we will destroy those instruments that allow this blackmail&quot;, he declared. Responding to a question about Berezovsky, he warned that he had a &quot;cudgel&quot; in store for him. &quot;The state has a cudgel in its hands that you use to hit just once, but on the head. We haven&#x27;t used this cudgel yet. We&#x27;ve just brandished it... [But] the day we get really angry, we won&#x27;t hesitate to use it.&quot;

In the same month, Russian prosecutors revived the Aeroflot fraud investigation and Berezovsky was questioned as a witness. On 7 November 2000, Berezovsky, who was travelling abroad, failed to appear for further questioning and announced that he would not return to Russia because of what he described as &quot;constantly intensifying pressure on me by the authorities and President Putin personally. Essentially,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#x27;m being forced to choose whether to become a political prisoner or a political emigrant.&quot; Berezovsky claimed that Putin had made him a suspect in the Aeroflot case simply because ORT had &quot;spoken the truth&quot; about the sinking of the submarine Kursk. In early December, his associate Nikolai Glushkov was arrested in Moscow and Berezovsky dropped the proposal to put ORT stake in trust.

===Divestment from Russian holdings===
In 2001, the Russian government made a systematic takeover of privately owned television networks, in the course of which Berezovsky, Gusinsky and Patarkatsishvili lost most of their media holdings, prompting one of them to warn of Russia &quot;turning into a banana republic&quot; in a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In February, Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili sold their stake in ORT to Roman Abramovich, who promptly ceded editorial control to the Kremlin. Berezovsky later claimed that there was a secret understanding that Nikolai Glushkov would be released from prison as part of that deal, a promise that was never fulfilled. In April, the government took control of Vladimir Gusinsky&#x27;s NTV. Berezovsky then moved to acquire a controlling stake in a smaller network, TV-6, made Patarkatsishvili its chairman, and offered employment to hundreds of locked out NTV journalists. Almost immediately, Patarkatshishvili became a target of police investigation and fled the country. In January 2002 a Russian arbitration court forced TV-6 (Russia) into liquidation. The liquidation of TV-6 was precipitated by LUKoil, a partly state-owned minority shareholder, using a piece of legislation that was almost immediately repealed.

In 2001, Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili ended their involvement in Sibneft for a US$1.3 billion fee from Roman Abramovich. This transaction was the subject of a later dispute in the UK commercial courts, with Berezovsky alleging that he had been put under pressure to sell his stake to Abramovich at a fraction of the true value, an allegation that the court rejected.

In 2006, Berezovsky sold the &quot;Kommersant&quot; (&quot;The Businessman&quot;) newspaper and his remaining Russian assets.

==Exile in Britain==
From his new home in the UK, Stanley House, where he and associates including Akhmed Zakayev, Alexander Litvinenko and Alex Goldfarb became known as &quot;the London Circle&quot; of Russian exiles, Berezovsky publicly stated that he was on a mission to bring down Putin &quot;by force&quot; or by bloodless revolution. He established the International Foundation for Civil Liberties (IFCL), to &quot;support the abused and the vulnerable in society – prisoners, national minorities and business people&quot; in Russia and criticized Putin&#x27;s record in the West.

Berezovsky launched a concerted campaign to expose alleged misdeeds of Vladimir Putin, from suppressing freedom of speech to committing war crimes in Chechnya. He also accused Russia&#x27;s FSB security service of staging the Moscow apartment bombings of 1999 in order to help Putin win the presidency. Many of these activities were funded through the New York-based IFCL, directed by Berezovsky&#x27;s friend Alex Goldfarb.

Berezovsky bought a Belgravia flat, the 125-acre Wentworth Park estate near Virginia Water in Surrey, and for a while owned the 172-acre Hascombe Court estate in Godalming. In 2012, he sold his Wentworth Park house.

===Political asylum and extradition proceedings===
On 9 September 2003, Berezovsky was granted refugee status and political asylum by the British Home Office which he, according to Alex Goldfarb, welcomed.

On 12 September 2003, judge Timothy Workman of Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court in central London dropped extradition proceedings against Berezovsky, ruling that it would be pointless to pursue the case as the granting of asylum status to Berezovsky made the proceedings redundant.

However, when Berezovsky told Reuters in early February 2006 that he was working on plans to overthrow Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Foreign Minister Jack Straw warned the London-based Russian tycoon not to plot against the Russian President while living in Britain. His refugee status could be reviewed if he continued to make such remarks.

===Convictions &quot;in absentia&quot; and investigations abroad===
After Berezovsky gained political asylum in Britain, the Russian authorities vigorously pursued various criminal charges against him. This culminated in two trials &quot;in absentia&quot;. From London, Berezovsky called the trial, which sentenced him to six years in prison, &quot;a farce&quot;. In June 2009, the Krasnogorsk City Court near Moscow sentenced Berezovsky to thirteen years imprisonment for defrauding AvtoVAZ of 58 million rubles (US$1.9 million) in the 1990s. Berezovsky was represented by a court-appointed lawyer.

In spite of Berezovsky&#x27;s successes in Britain in fighting off extradition requests and exposing Russian court convictions as politically motivated (see below), some other jurisdictions cooperated with Russian authorities in seizing his property and targeting his financial transactions as money laundering. Berezovsky succeeded in overturning some of these actions. In July 2007, Brazilian prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Berezovsky in connection with his investment in the Brazilian football club Corinthians. However, a year later the Brazilian Supreme Court cancelled the order and stopped the investigation. On Russian requests, French authorities raided his villa in Nice in search of documents, and seized his two yachts berthed on the French Riviera. However, some months later, the boats were released by a French court. Swiss prosecutors have been assisting their Russian colleagues for over a decade in investigating Berezovsky&#x27;s finances.

===Accusations and libel suits in the UK===
Berezovsky&#x27;s meteoric enrichment and involvement in power struggles have been accompanied by allegations of various crimes from his opponents. After his falling out with Putin and exile to London, these allegations became the recurrent theme of official state-controlled media, earning him comparisons with Leon Trotsky and the &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; character Emmanuel Goldstein.

In 1996, &quot;Forbes&quot;, an American business magazine, published an article by Paul Klebnikov entitled &quot;Godfather of the Kremlin?&quot; with the sub-heading &quot;Power. Politics. Murder. Boris Berezovsky could teach the guys in Sicily a thing or two.&quot; The article linked Berezovsky to corruption in the car industry, to the Chechen mafia and to the murder of Vladislav Listyev. In 2000, the House of Lords gave Berezovsky and Nikolai Glushkov permission to sue for libel in the UK courts. Given that only 2,000 of the 785,000 copies sold worldwide were sold in the United Kingdom, this led numerous scholars to cite &quot;the case&quot; as an example of libel tourism. The case slowly proceeded until the claimants opted to settle when &quot;Forbes&quot; offered a partial retraction. The following statement appended to the article on the &quot;Forbes&quot; website summarises: &quot;On 6 March 2003, the resolution of the case was announced in the High Court in London. &quot;Forbes&quot; stated in open court that (1) it was not the magazine&#x27;s intention to state that Berezovsky was responsible for the murder of Listiev, only that he had been included in an inconclusive police investigation of the crime; (2) there is no evidence that Berezovsky was responsible for this or any other murder; (3) in light of the English court&#x27;s ruling, it was wrong to characterize Berezovsky as a mafia boss; and (4) the magazine erred in stating that Glouchkov had been convicted for theft of state property in 1982.&quot; Klebnikov elaborated his allegations in his 2000 book &quot;Godfather of the Kremlin: Boris Berezovsky and the looting of Russia&quot; (the 2001 edition was titled &quot;Godfather of the Kremlin: The Decline of Russia in the Age of Gangster Capitalism&quot;).

In 2006, a UK court awarded Berezovsky £50,000 in libel damages against the Russian private bank Alfa-Bank and its chairman, Mikhail Fridman. Fridman had claimed on a Russian television programme that could be watched in the UK that Berezovsky had threatened him when the two men were competitors for control of the Kommersant publishing house, and that making threats was Berezovsky&#x27;s usual way of conducting business. The jury rejected the defendants&#x27; claim that Fridman&#x27;s allegations were true. Berezovsky accepted the apology and withdrew his libel suit.

In March 2010, Berezovsky, represented by Desmond Browne QC, won a libel case and was awarded £150,000 damages by the High Court in London over allegations that he had been behind the murder of Alexander Litvinenko. The allegations had been broadcast by the Russian state channel RTR Planeta in April 2007 on its programme &quot;Vesti Nedeli&quot;, which could be viewed from the UK. In his judgement, Mr Justice Eady stated: &quot;I can say unequivocally that there is no evidence before me that Mr Berezovsky had any part in the murder of Mr Litvinenko. Nor, for that matter, do I see any basis for reasonable grounds to suspect him of it.&quot; Berezovsky had sued both the channel and a man called Vladimir Terluk, whom Mr Justice Eady agreed was the man who had been interviewed in silhouette by the programme under the pseudonym &#x27;Pyotr&#x27;. Terluk had claimed that to further his UK asylum application Berezovsky had approached him to fabricate a murder plot against himself, and that Litvinenko knew of this. Mr Justice Eady accepted that Terluk had not himself alleged Berezovsky&#x27;s involvement in the murder of Litvinenko, but considered that his own allegations were themselves serious and that there was no truth in any of them. As RTR did not participate in the proceedings, Terluk was left to defend the case himself, receiving significant assistance (as the judge noted) from the Russian prosecutor&#x27;s office.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; described the 2010 libel case as &quot;almost anarchic at times as officials from the Russian prosecutors&#x27; office repeatedly intervened despite not being party to proceedings. So obvious was their intention that when one of their mobile phones went off in court one day, Desmond Browne quipped: &#x27;That must be Mr Putin on the line.&#x27;&quot; The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal but the appeal was dismissed, Lord Justice Laws giving a judgment with which the Chancellor of the High Court and Lady Justice Rafferty agreed. The Lord Justice described a witness statement of Andrei Lugovoi, newly adduced by the defendants, as &#x27;not sensibly capable of belief&#x27;.

===High Court case against Abramovich===

In 2011, Berezovsky brought a civil case against Roman Abramovich in the High Court of Justice in London, accusing Abramovich of blackmail, breach of trust and breach of contract, and seeking over £3 billion in damages. This became the largest civil court case in British legal history.

Berezovsky&#x27;s claimed past ownership of Sibneft – which constituted the bulk of his fortune – was put into question by Abramovich, who in a statement to the High Court in London asserted that Berezovsky had never owned shares in Sibneft, and that US$1.3 billion paid in 2001 ostensibly for his stake in the company was actually in recognition of Berezovsky&#x27;s &quot;political assistance and protection&quot; during the creation of Sibneft in 1995. The hearings, which started on 3 October 2011, examined Berezovsky&#x27;s US$5.5 billion claim against Abramovich for damages arising from the sale of his assets under alleged &quot;threats and intimidation&quot;.

In late 2011, Israeli private detective Tamir Mori ordered the mercenary Indian hack-for-hire firm Appin to hack more than 40 targets, including Berezovsky and his lawyers. On 31 August 2012, the High Court found for Abramovich. The High Court judge stated that because of the nature of the evidence, the case hinged on whether to believe Berezovsky or Abramovich&#x27;s evidence. In her ruling, the judge observed: &quot;On my analysis of the entirety of the evidence, I found Mr. Berezovsky an unimpressive, and inherently unreliable, witness, who regarded truth as a transitory, flexible concept, which could be moulded to suit his current purposes. ... I regret to say that the bottom line of my analysis of Mr. Berezovsky&#x27;s credibility is that he would
have said almost anything to support his case.&quot; She ruled that the monies paid represented a final payment in discharge of all obligations.

===Business and personal activities in exile===
Berezovsky conducted business with Neil Bush, the younger brother of the US President George W. Bush. Berezovsky was an investor in Bush&#x27;s Ignite! Learning, an educational software corporation, since at least 2003. In 2005, Neil Bush met with Berezovsky in Latvia, causing tension with Russia due to Berezovsky&#x27;s fugitive status. Neil Bush was also seen with Berezovsky in his box at an Arsenal F.C. match at the Emirates Stadium in London. There had been speculation that the relationship had become a cause of tension in Russo-American bilateral relations.

It had been speculated that Berezovsky&#x27;s wealth was depleted with the onset of the late 2000s recession. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, in 2011 his net worth was about US$900 million.

===Appeals for regime change===
In September 2005, Berezovsky said in an interview with the BBC: &quot;I&#x27;m sure that Putin doesn&#x27;t have the chance to survive, even to the next election in 2008. I am doing everything in my power to limit his time frame, and I am really thinking of returning to Russia after Putin collapses, which he will.&quot; In January 2006, Berezovsky stated in an interview to a Moscow-based radio station that he was working on overthrowing the administration of Vladimir Putin by force. Berezovsky also accused Putin of being &quot;a gangster&quot; and the &quot;terrorist number one&quot;.

Berezovsky declared that he was plotting the overthrow of President Putin on 13 April 2007 during an interview &quot;The Guardian&quot; conducted: &quot;We need to use force to change this regime. It isn&#x27;t possible to change this regime through democratic means. There can be no change without force, pressure.&quot; He also admitted that during the last six years he had struggled hard to &quot;destroy the positive image of Putin&quot; and said that &quot;Putin has created an authoritarian regime against the Russian constitution. ... I don&#x27;t know how it will happen, but authoritarian regimes only collapse by force.&quot;

Soon after Berezovsky&#x27;s 2007 statement, Garry Kasparov, a figure in the opposition movement The Other Russia and leader of the United Civil Front, wrote the following on his website: &quot;Berezovsky has lived in emigration for many years and no longer has significant influence upon the political processes which take place in Russian society. His extravagant proclamations are simply a method of attracting attention. Furthermore, for the overwhelming majority of Russian people he was a political symbol of the 90s, one of the &#x27;bad blokes&#x27; enriching themselves behind the back of president Yeltsin. The informational noise around Berezovsky was specifically beneficial for the Kremlin, which was trying to compromise Russia&#x27;s real opposition. Berezovsky has not had and does not have any relation to Other Russia or the United Civil Front.&quot; Berezovsky responded in June 2007 by saying that &quot;there is not one significant politician in Russia whom he has not financed&quot; and that this included members of Other Russia. The managing director of the United Civil Front, in turn, said that the organization would consider suing Berezovsky over these allegations, but the lawsuit has never been brought before the court.

The Russian Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office had launched a criminal investigation against Berezovsky to determine whether his comments could be considered a &quot;seizure of power by force&quot;, as outlined in the Russian Criminal Code. If convicted, an offender faces up to twenty years imprisonment. The British Foreign Office denounced Berezovsky&#x27;s statements, warning him that his status of a political refugee might be reconsidered, should he continue to make similar remarks. Furthermore, Scotland Yard had announced that it would investigate whether Berezovsky&#x27;s statements violated the law. However, in the following July, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that Berezovsky would not face charges in the UK for his comments. Kremlin officials called it a &quot;disturbing moment&quot; in Anglo-Russian relations.

===Involvement in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election===
In September 2005, the former president of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, accused Berezovsky of having financed Viktor Yushchenko&#x27;s 2004 Ukrainian presidential election campaign, and provided copies of documents showing money transfers from companies he claimed were controlled by Berezovsky to companies controlled by Yuschenko&#x27;s official backers. Berezovsky claimed that he met Yushchenko&#x27;s representatives in London before the election, and that the money was transferred from his companies, but he declined to confirm or deny that the companies that received the money were used in Yushchenko&#x27;s campaign. Financing of election campaigns by foreign citizens is illegal in Ukraine. In November 2005, Berezovsky also claimed he had heavily financed Ukraine&#x27;s Orange Revolution (that had followed the presidential election). In September 2007, Berezovsky launched lawsuits against two Ukrainian politicians, Oleksandr Tretyakov, a former presidential aid, and David Zhvaniya, a former emergencies minister. Berezovsky was suing the men for nearly US$23 million, accusing them of misusing the money he had allocated in 2004 to fund the Orange Revolution. Yushchenko has denied Berezovsky financed his election campaign.

Berezovsky called on Ukrainian business to support Yushchenko in the 2010 presidential election of January 2010 as a guarantor of debarment of property redistribution after the election. On 10 December 2009, the Ukrainian minister of interior affairs Yuriy Lutsenko stated that if the Russian interior ministry requested it, Berezovsky would be detained upon arriving in Ukraine.

In February 2012, in an interview for the independent Russian TV Rain channel Berezovsky reiterated that he had personally provided approximately $50 million to the Ukrainian Orange revolution. () and Oleksandr Tretiakov were among the ones who allegedly received money.

===&quot;Persona non-grata&quot; in Latvia since October 2005===
In October 2005, Latvian Prime Minister Aigars Kalvītis signed a decree placing Berezovsky on the list of &quot;personae non gratae&quot;. The exact reasons for blacklisting Berezovsky were not disclosed. Kalvitis called Berezovsky a &quot;threat&quot; to national security. Previously, the National Security Council of Latvia took the decision to recommend that Berezovsky be barred from travelling to Latvia. The decision to bar the one-time Russian oligarch came swiftly after Berezovsky&#x27;s trip to Riga in September 2005. Berezovsky was in Riga along with Neil Bush to discuss a project with Latvian businessmen.

The Baltic News Service quoted Berezovsky saying that he believes Latvia&#x27;s decision to declare him &quot;persona non-grata&quot; was the result of intense pressure by Russia and structures linked with George Soros, the US business magnate who had had acrimonious relations with Berezovsky. Kalvitis however denied the theory that the banning came on pressure from the Kremlin or the White House.

==Alleged assassination attempts in London==
===Alleged 2003 plot===
According to Alexander Litvinenko, a Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officer in London was preparing to assassinate Berezovsky with a binary weapon in September 2003. This alleged plot was reported to British police. Hazel Blears, then a Home Office Minister, said that inquiries made [into these claims] were &quot;unable to either substantiate this information or find evidence of any criminal offences having been committed&quot;.

===Alleged 2007 plot===
In June 2007, Berezovsky said he fled Britain on the advice of Scotland Yard, amid reports that he was the target of an assassination attempt by a suspected Russian hitman. On 18 July 2007, the British tabloid &quot;The Sun&quot; reported that the alleged would-be assassin was captured by the police at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane. They reported that the suspect, arrested by the anti-terrorist police after being tracked for a week by MI5, was deported back to Russia when no weapons were found and there was not enough evidence to charge him with any offence. In addition, they said British police placed a squad of uniformed officers around Akhmed Zakayev&#x27;s house in north London, and also phoned Litvinenko&#x27;s widow, Marina, to urge her to take greater security precautions.

Berezovsky again accused Vladimir Putin of being behind a plot to assassinate him. The Kremlin had denied similar claims in the past.

According to the interview given by a high-ranking British security official on BBC Two in July 2008, the alleged Russian agent, known as &quot;A&quot;, was of Chechen nationality. He was identified by &quot;Kommersant&quot; as the Chechen mobster Movladi Atlangeriyev; after returning to Russia, Atlangeriyev was forcibly disappeared in January 2008 by unknown men in Moscow.

==Death of friends and associates in London==
===Death of Alexander Litvinenko in November 2006===

Alexander Litvinenko, one of Berezovsky&#x27;s closest associates, was murdered in London in November 2006 with a rare radioactive poison, Polonium 210. The British authorities charged a former FSB officer and head of security at ORT, Andrey Lugovoy, with the murder and requested his extradition, which Russia refused. Several Russian diplomats were expelled from the UK over the case. The UK government has not publicly expressed a view on the matter, but allegations that the murder was sponsored by the Russian state have been expressed by &quot;sources in the UK government&quot;, according to the BBC, and by officials of the US Department of State, as revealed by leaked diplomatic cables; they were reflected in a 2008 resolution by the US Congress. The intricate details of the murder, the relationship between Litvinenko and Berezosvsky, and the implications of the case have been described in the 2007 book, &quot;Death of a Dissident: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB&quot; by Alex Goldfarb with Marina Litvinenko.

An alternative, more dubious narrative – that the murder was orchestrated by Berezovsky and his associate Alex Goldfarb with the aim of &quot;framing&quot; the Russian government and discrediting it on the global stage – has aired in Russian state-funded media by Lugovoy, by Litvinenko&#x27;s Italy-based father, by Nikita Chekulin and by Russian officials. Berezovsky won a UK libel suit against Russian State Television over these allegations in 2010 (see above), following which he commented, &quot;I trust the conclusions of the British investigators that the trail leads to Russia and I hope that one day justice will prevail.&quot;

===Death of Badri Patarkatsishvili in February 2008===
In the evening of Tuesday, 12 February 2008, Georgia&#x27;s richest man, billionaire Arkady &quot;Badri&quot; Patarkatsishvili, a close friend and long-time business partner of Berezovsky, collapsed and died in his bedroom after a family dinner at Downside Manor, his mansion in Leatherhead, Surrey, England, at the age of 52.

Patarkatsishvili, who as a presidential candidate had also been campaigning to oust Georgia&#x27;s President Mikhail Saakashvili, spent his last day in the City of London office of international law firm Debevoise and Plimpton. He was preparing along with his lawyer Lord Goldsmith QC and fellow exiles, the Russians Nikolai Glushkov and Yuli Dubov. Shortly after dining at Downside Manor, Patarkatsishvili told his family he felt unwell and went upstairs to his bedroom where he was found unconscious after a heart attack. Resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful. As in any other case of unexpected death, Surrey police treated the case as &quot;suspicious&quot; and launched an official investigation. Preliminary reports indicated a heart attack as the cause of death.

Berezovsky described the death of his closest friend as &quot;a terrible tragedy&quot;.

==Death==

On 23 March 2013, Berezovsky was found dead at his home, Titness Park, at Sunninghill, near Ascot in Berkshire. His body was found by a bodyguard in a locked bathroom, with a ligature around his neck.

His death was announced in a post on Facebook, by his son-in-law. Alexander Dobrovinsky, a lawyer who had represented Berezovsky, wrote that he may have committed suicide, adding that Berezovsky had fallen into debt after losing the lawsuit against Abramovich, and had spent the final few months of his life selling his possessions to cover his court costs. Berezovsky was also said to have recently been depressed and to have isolated himself from friends. He reportedly suffered from depression and was taking antidepressant drugs; a day prior to his death he told a reporter in London that he had nothing left to live for.

The Thames Valley Police classified his death as &quot;unexplained&quot; and launched a formal investigation into the circumstances behind it. Specialists in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials were deployed to Berezovsky&#x27;s home as a &quot;precaution&quot;. These specialists later &quot;found nothing of concern&quot;.

Berezovsky was buried on 8 May 2013 in a private ceremony at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey. The burial timing had been changed on several occasions to try to avoid interest from the Russian media.

A post-mortem examination carried out by the Home Office pathologist found the cause of death was consistent with hanging and there was nothing pointing to a violent struggle. At the March 2014 inquest into the death, however, Berezovsky&#x27;s daughter Elizaveta introduced a report by German pathologist Bernd Brinkmann, with whom she had shared the autopsy photos, noting that the ligature mark on her father&#x27;s neck was circular rather than V-shaped as is commonly the case with hanging victims, and called the coroner&#x27;s attention to a statement by one of the responding paramedics who found it strange that Berezovsky&#x27;s face was purple, rather than pale as hanging victims usually are. The body also had a fresh wound on the back of the head and a fractured rib (injuries police believed Berezovsky could have suffered in the process of falling as he hanged himself). An unidentified fingerprint was found near the body, and one paramedic&#x27;s radiation alarm sounded as they entered the house. Pathologist Bernd Brinkmann said that he did not believe that the marks on Berezovsky&#x27;s neck were a result of hanging. Following the inquest the coroner, Peter Bedford, recorded an open verdict commenting, &quot;I am not saying Mr Berezovsky took his own life, I am not saying Mr Berezovsky was unlawfully killed. What I am saying is that the burden of proof sets such a high standard it is impossible for me to say.&quot;

===Apology to Putin===
After Berezovsky&#x27;s death, a spokesman for President Putin reported that Berezovsky had sent a letter to the Russian president, asking for permission to return to Russia and asking &quot;forgiveness for his mistakes&quot;. Some of Berezovsky&#x27;s associates doubted the letter&#x27;s existence, claiming that it was out of character. However, his girlfriend at the time, Katerina Sabirova, later confirmed in an interview that he did in fact send the letter:

It was claimed by anonymous sources that rival Roman Abramovich delivered the letter to Putin personally, having received an apology from Berezovsky himself. Both Putin&#x27;s chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov, and Abramovich&#x27;s spokesman alluded to the letter being passed by a &quot;certain person&quot;, but did not go into details due to the personal nature of the issue.

==Publications by Berezovsky==
Berezovsky was a doctor of technical sciences and author of many academic papers and studies such as &quot;Binary relations in multi-criteria optimizations&quot; and &quot;Multi-criteria optimization: mathematical aspects&quot;. In the mathematical review index MathSciNet, B. A. Berezovsky is credited with 16 publications from 1975 to 1989 on operations research and mathematical programming, earning 9 citations in other publications. Most cited is the book &quot;The Problem of Optimal Choice&quot; with A. V. Gnedin (Nauka, Moscow 1984), devoted to secretary problems.

Aside from his academic publications, he frequently authored articles and gave interviews; these are collected in &quot;The Art of the Impossible&quot; (3 volumes). He continued to contribute articles while in exile, taking a highly critical view of Russia&#x27;s political leaders.

==Works about Berezovsky==
In 1996, the Russian-American journalist Paul Klebnikov wrote a highly critical article entitled &quot;Godfather of the Kremlin?&quot; on Berezovsky and the state of Russia more generally, in response to which Berezovsky sued &quot;Forbes&quot; in the UK; in 2001, he expanded his article into a book entitled &quot;Godfather of the Kremlin&quot;, alternatively subtitled &quot;The Decline of Russia in the Age of Gangster Capitalism&quot; and &quot;Boris Berezovsky and the looting of Russia&quot;. On 9 July 2004, while leaving the &quot;Forbes&quot; office in Moscow, unknown assailants fired at Klebnikov from a slowly moving car. He was shot four times and died later in hospital. The same day Berezovsky, in the words of investigative journalist Richard Behar, &quot;whipped out his tongue from its holster and publicly called the 41-year-old editor of Forbes Russia &#x27;a dishonest reporter. The books &quot;Secret Diary of a Russian Oligarch&quot; and &quot;How to get rid of an Oligarch or Who Beat Berezovsky&quot; by Sasha Nerozina (friend of the Berezovsky family and a spokeswoman of Berezovsky&#x27;s wife Galina) were published in Russia and other former Soviet states in 2013 and 2014 by Olma Media Publishing House.

Yuli Dubov, a close business associate of Berezovsky, wrote a novel based on Berezovsky&#x27;s life which provided the basis for the 2002 film &quot;Tycoon&quot;. Like Berezovsky, he fled to London and successfully fought extradition to Russia. Judge Timothy Workman of Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court in central London dropped extradition proceedings against Yuly Dubov in October 2003.

Alex Goldfarb, a microbiologist and activist who became acquainted with Berezovsky in the 1990s and later worked for him, provides snapshots of Berezovsky at crucial moments as background to his 2007 account of the Litvinenko murder case, co-written with Marina Litvinenko, &quot;Death of a Dissident: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB&quot;. David E. Hoffman of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;The Oligarchs: Wealth and Power in the New Russia&quot;, which provides a comparative treatment of Berezovsky and several of his fellow so-called business oligarchs. Ben Mezrich wrote &quot;Once Upon a Time in Russia: The Rise of the Oligarchs—A True Story of Ambition, Wealth, Betrayal, and Murder&quot;, which provides a comparative narrative of Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich through their careers, friendship, and ultimate rivalry.

In 2017, the Russian book &quot;The age of Berezovsky&quot; (also known as &quot;The time of Berezovsky&quot;) was published by Corpus (an imprint of AST), in which Petr Aven – a friend of Berezovsky – interviewed various people who were close to Berezovsky at different times, including Leonid Boguslavsky, Yuli Dubov, Galina Besharova, Yelena Gorbunova, Yuri Shefler, Anatoly Chubais, Mikhail Fridman, Valentin Yumashev, Sergey Dorenko, Eugene Shvidler, Vladimir Posner, Alexander Goldfarb, Alexander Voloshin, Stanislav Belkovsky and Yuri Felshtinsky. In the book Aven opined that Berezovsky &quot;played a particularly important role in two episodes of new Russian history: the 1996
election and the struggle against Primakov and Luzhkov in
1999&quot;.

A documentary about Berezovsky&#x27;s efforts to undermine Putin from his exile in UK was shown on BBC Two in December 2005.

Berezovsky features in a painting by the Russian artist Ilya Glazunov, displayed in Moscow&#x27;s Ilya Glazunov Gallery. According to the Rough Guide, &quot;&quot;The Market of Our Democracy&quot; shows Yeltsin waving a conductor&#x27;s baton as two lesbians kiss and the oligarch Berezovsky flaunts a sign reading &#x27;I will buy Russia&#x27;, while charlatans rob a crowd of refugees and starving children.&quot;

Berezovsky also features as a character in the opera &quot;The Life and Death of Alexander Litvinenko&quot; by Alexander Woolf to a libretto by David Pountney, which was premiered in July 2021 at Grange Park Opera.

&quot;Patriots&quot; premiered at the Almeida Theatre in Islington, London, in May 2022, following the life of Berezovsky from the president&#x27;s inner circle to public enemy number one. Tom Hollander played Berezovsky. The play was written by Peter Morgan and directed by Rupert Goold. It played a limited run from 2 July 2022 until 20 August. It transferred to the West End in 2023.

In the 2022 ITVX miniseries &quot;Litvinenko&quot;, Berezovsky was portrayed by Nikolai Tsankov.

<text>David James Bancroft (April 20, 1891 – October 9, 1972) was an American professional baseball shortstop and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Giants, Boston Braves and the Brooklyn Robins between 1915 and 1930.

Born in Sioux City, Iowa, Bancroft played in minor league baseball from 1909 through 1914, at which point he was bought by the Phillies. The Giants traded for Bancroft during the 1920 season. After playing for the Giants through the 1923 season, he became player-manager of the Braves, serving in that role for four years. After he was fired by the Braves, Bancroft played two seasons for the Robins and ended his playing career with the Giants the next season. He coached with the Giants, then managed in the minor leagues and the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

Bancroft was part of the Giants&#x27; World Series championship teams in 1921 and 1922. He was also a part of the National League pennant-winning teams of 1915 and 1923. Considered an excellent defensive shortstop and a smart ball player, Bancroft was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1971. His election was not without controversy as the Committee included former teammates of Bancroft, resulting in charges of cronyism.

==Early life==
Bancroft was born on April 20, 1891, in Sioux City, Iowa, the youngest of three children of Ella (née Gearhart) and Frank Bancroft. Frank worked as a news vendor on the Milwaukee Railroad. Bancroft attended Hopkins Grade School and Sioux City High School.

==Career==

===Early career===
In the summer after his junior year of high school, at the age of 18, Bancroft began his professional career in 1909 with the Duluth White Sox of the Class-D Minnesota–Wisconsin League. Bancroft did not have immediate success, registering a .210 batting average and .917 fielding percentage in 111 games, but he developed a positive reputation in the league. The Superior Blues acquired Bancroft at midseason, and he remained there through the 1911 season. Bancroft finished the 1911 season with a .273 batting average and 41 stolen bases, and the Blues won the league championship.

The Portland Beavers of the Class-AA Pacific Coast League (PCL) drafted Bancroft from Superior for the 1912 season. He struggled in 1912, batting .207, and was demoted to the Portland Colts of the Class-B Northwestern League in 1913. After batting .244 for the Colts, he was promoted back to the Beavers in 1914, where he batted .271 and drew comparisons to former Beavers star shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh as the team won the PCL championship. While with the Beavers, Bancroft earned the nickname &quot;Beauty&quot;, for his habit of referring to pitches as &quot;beauties&quot; while he batted.

===Major League Baseball===

====Philadelphia Phillies====
Before the 1915 season, the Philadelphia Phillies purchased Bancroft from Portland for $5,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Portland&#x27;s manager was quoted as saying he did not expect Bancroft would last with the Phillies. In his rookie season, Bancroft finished second in the National League (NL) to teammate Gavvy Cravath in walks (77), third in runs scored (85), and tied Fred Luderus for sixth in home runs (7). For his ability to hit with power from both sides of the plate, &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; declared he was developing into &quot;a second Honus Wagner&quot;. The Phillies won their first NL pennant in 1915, but lost the 1915 World Series to the Boston Red Sox. Bancroft&#x27;s offense contributed to the Phillies&#x27; victory in Game 1, as he had an infield hit leading to the Phillies&#x27; winning run. Though the Phillies batted .182 as a team in the series, Bancroft batted .294.
Bancroft batted third in the Phillies&#x27; lineup in 1916. However, he slumped to a .212 batting average that season, the lowest of his career. Despite his offensive struggles, he gained recognition for his fielding skills, and an injury to Bancroft late in the season contributed to the Phillies&#x27; poor play late in the season.

Bancroft feuded with Cravath, who became the Phillies&#x27; manager in 1919. Before the 1919 season, Bancroft requested a trade to the Cincinnati Reds, but the trade request was not granted. John McGraw, manager of the New York Giants, coveted Bancroft due to his intelligent and hard-nosed style of playing. Upon McGraw&#x27;s urging, the Giants traded Art Fletcher, Bill Hubbell and $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms) to the Phillies for Bancroft on June 7, 1920.

====New York Giants====
With the Giants, Bancroft was an able performer. His 102 runs scored during the 1920 season were second only to new Giants teammate George Burns. On June 1, 1921, in a game the Giants won against the Phillies, Bancroft hit for the cycle. His 153 games played in the 1921 season tied for second in the NL with several others, behind only Rogers Hornsby. He also tied teammate Frankie Frisch for second with 121 runs scored, behind only Hornsby, while his 193 hits were eighth-best and his .389 on-base percentage was ninth-best in the NL. However, he only batted .152 in the 1921 World Series, which the Giants won over the New York Yankees in eight games.

Bancroft played in all 156 games in the 1922 season. He tied Jack Smith for third with 117 runs scored, finished third with 209 hits, and tied Bob O&#x27;Farrell for second with 79 walks. His .321 batting average was his career-high. He set an MLB record for the most fielding chances by a shortstop in a season (984). Though the Giants swept the 1922 World Series from the Yankees in four games, he again had a poor World Series, batting .211.
Serving as team captain, Bancroft began to suffer through leg injuries in 1923. He was also hospitalized with a case of pneumonia during the season. Bancroft returned by the postseason, but batted .091 in the 1923 World Series, which the Yankees won in six games.

====Boston Braves====
With a young Travis Jackson ready to succeed Bancroft as the Giants&#x27; shortstop, and with Bancroft desiring an opportunity to manage, McGraw traded Bancroft to the Boston Braves with Bill Cunningham and Casey Stengel for Joe Oeschger and Billy Southworth after the 1923 season. McGraw was also looking to aid his former star Christy Mathewson, who was then the general manager of the Braves.

Bancroft served as player–manager for the Braves for three seasons, from 1924 through 1927. Upon becoming manager, he became the youngest manager in the National League (NL). He missed time during the 1924 season with appendicitis. After finishing in last place in the eight-team NL, Bancroft overhauled the Braves&#x27; roster for the 1925 season. However, he lost the services of Rube Marquard and Joe Genewich, and the Braves finished in fifth place. Bancroft suggested that Bob Smith, ineffective as an infielder, become a pitcher; Smith&#x27;s successes as a pitcher benefited the Braves&#x27; starting rotation. The Braves lacked offense going into the 1926 season, but hoped their pitching and defense could lead them into contention. The Braves finished in seventh place in the NL in 1926 and 1927.

====Brooklyn Robins and return to the Giants====
Failing to turn the Braves into a winning team, Bancroft requested his release from the team after the 1927 season. He signed with the Brooklyn Robins the same day. Stating that he was happy to no longer have the stress of managing, he played for the Robins for the 1928 and 1929 seasons. During his time with the Robins, he was seen as a possible successor to manager Wilbert Robinson.

The Robins released Bancroft after the 1929 season, and he returned to the Giants as assistant manager and coach, serving under McGraw. He ended his MLB playing career in 1930. He remained as a coach, filling in for McGraw when he was too ill to manage. During the 1930 offseason, he led a team of MLB players on an exhibition trip to Cuba. When McGraw retired in 1932, the Giants appointed Bill Terry as player-manager. Surprised and disappointed that Terry was chosen over him, Bancroft left the Giants.

===Later career===
After retiring as a player, Bancroft managed in minor league baseball. He managed the Minneapolis Millers of the Class-AA American Association in 1933. Though the Millers reached the championship series, he was not retained for the 1934 season, as the Millers sought a player-manager to help the team reduce costs.

After the season, Bancroft interviewed for the managerial job with the Cincinnati Reds; however, the Reds hired O&#x27;Farrell. Bancroft next managed the Sioux City Cowboys of the Class-A Western League in 1936. He appeared in one game for Sioux City as a player. Bancroft then managed the St. Cloud Rox of the Class-C Northern League in 1947. In the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, Bancroft managed the Chicago Colleens in 1948 and South Bend Blue Sox in 1949 and 1950.

==Legacy==

Grover Cleveland Alexander, Bancroft&#x27;s teammate in Philadelphia, and Hughie Jennings, his coach in New York, considered Bancroft one of the best shortstops in MLB. Sportswriter Frank Graham called Bancroft &quot;the greatest shortstop the Giants ever had and one of the greatest that ever lived.&quot; Bancroft is still considered to be among the top fielders in baseball history. He was also considered one of the fastest shortstops in baseball. In contrast to other great fielding shortstops, Bancroft was noted for his offensive ability.
After failing to be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA), the Veterans Committee elected Bancroft in 1971. Former Giants teammates Terry and Frankie Frisch, who joined the Veterans Committee in 1967, aided the elections of several of their former teammates; they shepherded the selections of Jesse Haines in 1970, Bancroft and Chick Hafey in 1971, Ross Youngs in 1972, George Kelly in 1973, Jim Bottomley in 1974, and Freddie Lindstrom in 1976. Bancroft, along with some of the other selections made by Terry and Frisch, has been considered among the weakest of all inductees. According to the BBWAA, the Veterans Committee was not selective enough in choosing members. Charges of cronyism were levied against the Veterans Committee. This led to the Veterans Committee having its powers reduced in subsequent years.

Despite the criticism of players elected to the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in this period, Bancroft grades well in terms of sabermetric statistics. He finished fourth in the NL in Wins Above Replacement in 1920 (6.5) and third in 1921 (7.2) and 1922 (6.0). Bancroft was also inducted in &quot;The Des Moines Register&quot;s Iowa Sports Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Bancroft married Edna Harriet Gisin while he played minor league baseball. They had no children and lived in Superior, Wisconsin, for the remainder of their lives.

After retiring from baseball, Bancroft worked as a warehouse supervisor with the Interprovincial Pipeline Company. He retired in 1956 and spent his later years hunting and fishing. Bancroft died on October 9, 1972, in a hospital in Superior at the age of 81.

<doc id="355497" wikidata="Q6900022" url="?curid=355497" title="Monica Moorehead">
<text>Monica Gail Moorehead (born 1952) is an American retired teacher, writer, and political activist. She was the presidential nominee of the Workers World Party (WWP) in 1996, 2000, and 2016.

==Biography==
A political activist since high school, Moorehead distributed newspapers for the Black Panther Party and subsequently joined the WWP in 1972. She rose to the national leadership in 1979. In 1996, Moorehead was the presidential nominee of the party. She appeared on the ballot in 12 states and received around 29,000 votes, 0.3 percent of all cast, the best-ever showing for a WWP candidate in a presidential election. In 2000 she received 4,795 votes; that year she was only on the ballot in Florida, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin. On both occasions, her vice-presidential running-mate was Gloria La Riva.

In an open letter (entitled &quot;Blame Monica!&quot;), posted on his website shortly after the U.S. presidential election of 2000, filmmaker and activist Michael Moore sarcastically argued that Moorehead, not supporters of Ralph Nader like himself, were responsible for the election of George W. Bush.

Other works include being the author of &quot;Feminism and Marxism in the 90s&quot; and &quot;South Africa: Which Road to Liberation?&quot; She also edited the book &quot;Marxism, Reparations, and the Black Freedom Struggle&quot;, a collection of articles from &quot;Workers World&quot; newspaper, written by herself and others.

In 2004, Moorehead was one of the campaign managers for the party&#x27;s presidential candidate, John Parker. During the 2008 presidential campaign, she endorsed Green Party candidate, Cynthia McKinney.

===2016 presidential election===

On November 8, 2015, Moorehead received the 2016 presidential nomination of the Workers World Party, the first time since 2004 that the party had opted to run a presidential candidate. Her running mate was Lamont Lilly. At the time of Moorehead&#x27;s nomination, the party did not have ballot access in any state. Moorehead ran in the Peace and Freedom Party&#x27;s presidential primary in California, and received 1,487 votes, 29.72 percent of all ballots cast. Moorehead lost to Gloria la Riva, by then a member of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, who won with 49.47 percent of the vote. 

Farleigh Dickinson University included Moorehead as one of four choices — along with Clinton, Trump, and Prohibition Party candidate Jim Hedges — in an October 2016 poll and found that, in the absence of the Green and Libertarian Party nominees as named choices, Moorehead drew three percent support. In the 2016 general election, Moorehead appeared on the ballot in three states — New Jersey, Utah, and Wisconsin — and as a recognized write-in candidate in six others. She received a total of 4,317 votes. 

In 2019, the &quot;Atlantic&quot; referred to Moorehead as &quot;the once and perhaps future presidential candidate of the Workers World Party&quot;, although she did not run in 2020.

<text>Leonotis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. One species, &quot;Leonotis nepetifolia&quot;, is native to tropical Africa and southern India. It is naturalized throughout most of the tropics. The other species are endemic to southern + eastern Africa.

&quot;Leonotis&quot; was named by Robert Brown in 1810 in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The name means &quot;lion&#x27;s ear&quot;.

The type for the genus is the specimen of &quot;Leonotis ocymifolia&quot; that was originally described as &quot;Leonotis leonitis&quot;. It is a specimen of &quot;Leonotis ocymifolia var. ocymifolia&quot;.

Leonotis leonurus and Leonotis nepetifolia seem to be mildly psychoactive, similar to cannabis albeit producing a far less potent and less intense &quot;high&quot; 

==Species==
# &quot;Leonotis decadonta&quot; - southeast Africa from Burundi + Tanzania south to Mozambique
# &quot;Leonotis goetzei&quot; - Tanzania
# &quot;Leonotis grandis&quot;      - Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia
# &quot;Leonotis leonurus&quot; - South Africa, Angola; naturalized in Burundi, Java, St. Helena
# &quot;Leonotis myricifolia&quot; - Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia
# &quot;Leonotis myrothamnifolia&quot; - Malawi, Zambia
# &quot;Leonotis nepetifolia&quot; - sub-Saharan Africa from Ethiopia west to Senegal and south to Transvaal, also Indian subcontinent; naturalized in Morocco, Canary Islands, Southeast Asia, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, much of Latin America; West Indies
# &quot;Leonotis ocymifolia&quot; - eastern Africa from Sudan + Eritrea south to Transvaal
# &quot;Leonotis pole-evansii&quot; - Zambia

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Leonotis&quot; is a member of the subfamily Lamioideae. &quot;Leonotis&quot; might be paraphyletic or even polyphyletic because &quot;Leonotis leonurus&quot; is not closely related to the other species. In 2009, it was shown that &quot;Leonotis&quot; and 3 other genera are embedded in &quot;Leucas&quot;, a genus of about 100 species. If the 4 embedded genera were merged with &quot;Leucas&quot;, the expanded &quot;Leucas&quot; would have about 132 species.

<doc id="355502" wikidata="Q201608" url="?curid=355502" title="Dennis Rodman">
<text>Dennis Keith Rodman (born May 13, 1961) is an American former professional basketball player. Renowned for his defensive and rebounding abilities, his biography on the official NBA website states that he is &quot;arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history&quot;. Nicknamed &quot;the Worm&quot;, he played for the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs, Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, and Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Rodman played at the small forward position in his early years before becoming a power forward.

He earned NBA All-Defensive First Team honors seven times and won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice. He also led the NBA in rebounds per game for a record seven consecutive years and won five NBA championships. On April 1, 2011, the Pistons retired Rodman&#x27;s No. 10 jersey, and he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame later that year. In October 2021, Rodman was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.

Rodman experienced an unhappy childhood and was often described as shy and introverted in his early years. After aborting a suicide attempt in 1993, he reinvented himself as a &quot;bad boy&quot; and became notorious for numerous controversial antics. He repeatedly dyed his hair in artificial colors, had many piercings and tattoos, and regularly disrupted games by clashing with opposing players and officials. He famously wore a wedding dress to promote his 1996 autobiography &quot;Bad as I Wanna Be&quot;. Rodman also attracted international attention for his visits to North Korea and his subsequent befriending of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2013.

In addition to being a former professional basketball player, Rodman has appeared in professional wrestling. He was a member of the nWo and fought alongside Hulk Hogan in the main event of two Bash at the Beach pay-per-views. In professional wrestling, Rodman was the first-ever winner of the Celebrity Championship Wrestling tournament. He had his own TV show, &quot;The Rodman World Tour&quot;, and had starring roles in the action films &quot;Double Team&quot; (1997) and &quot;Simon Sez&quot; (1999). He appeared in several reality TV series and was the winner of the $222,000 main prize of the 2004 edition of &quot;Celebrity Mole&quot;.

==Early life==
Rodman was born in Trenton, New Jersey, the son of Shirley and Philander Rodman, Jr., an Air Force enlisted member, who later fought in the Vietnam War. When he was young, his father left his family, eventually settling in the Philippines. Rodman has many brothers and sisters: according to his father, he has either 26 or 28 siblings on his father&#x27;s side. However, Rodman has stated that he is the oldest of a total of 47 children.

After his father left, Shirley took many odd jobs to support the family, up to four at the same time. In his 1996 biography &quot;Bad As I Wanna Be&quot;, he expresses his feelings for his father: &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen my father in more than 30 years, so what&#x27;s there to miss ... I just look at it like this: Some man brought me into this world. That doesn&#x27;t mean I have a father&quot;. He would not meet his father again until 2012.

Rodman and his two sisters, Debra and Kim, grew up in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas, at the time one of the most impoverished areas of the city. Rodman&#x27;s mother gave him the nickname &quot;The Worm&quot; for how he wiggles while playing pinball. Rodman was so attached to his mother that he refused to move when she sent him to a nursery when he was four years old. According to Rodman, his mother was more interested in his two sisters, who were both considered more talented than he was in basketball and made him a laughingstock whenever he tagged along with them. He felt generally &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by the all-female household. Debra and Kim would go on to become All-Americans at Louisiana Tech and Stephen F. Austin, respectively. Debra won two national titles with the Lady Techsters.

While attending South Oak Cliff High School, Rodman was a gym class student of future Texas A&amp;M basketball coach Gary Blair. Blair coached Rodman&#x27;s sisters Debra and Kim, winning three state championships. However, Rodman was not considered an athletic standout. According to Rodman, he was &quot;unable to hit a layup&quot; and was listed in the high school basketball teams but was either benched or cut from the squads. Measuring only as a freshman in high school, he also failed to make the football teams and was &quot;totally devastated&quot;.

==College career==
After finishing high school, Rodman worked as an overnight janitor at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. He then experienced a sudden growth spurt from to and decided to try basketball again, despite becoming even more withdrawn because he felt odd in his own body.

A family friend tipped off the head coach of Cooke County College (now North Central Texas College) in Gainesville, Texas. In his single semester there, he averaged 17.6 points and 13.3 rebounds, before flunking out due to poor academic performance. After his short stint in Gainesville, he transferred to Southeastern Oklahoma State University, an NAIA school. There, Rodman was a three-time NAIA All-American and led the NAIA in rebounding twice (1985, 1986). In three seasons there (1983–1986), he averaged 25.7 points and 15.7 rebounds, and registered a .637 field goal percentage. In 1986 he led his team to the NAIA semifinals where he scored 46 points in a single game, while grabbing a tournament-tying record 32 rebounds, as they finished the season with the highest ranking in school history, at No. 3 in the nation. This helped get him invited to the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, a pre-draft camp for NBA hopefuls, where he won Most Valuable Player honors and caught the attention of the Detroit Pistons.

During college, Rodman worked at a summer youth basketball camp, where he befriended camper Byrne Rich who was 13 years old at the time, who was shy and withdrawn due to a hunting accident in which he mistakenly shot and killed his best friend. The two became almost inseparable. Rich invited Rodman to his rural Oklahoma home; at first, Rodman was not well-received by the Riches due to the fact he was 22 years old and black, but the Riches were so grateful to him for bringing their son out of his shell that they were able to set aside their prejudices. Although Rodman had severe family and personal issues himself, he &quot;adopted&quot; the Riches as his own in 1982 and went from the city life to &quot;driving a tractor and messing with cows&quot;. Though Rodman credited the Riches as his &quot;surrogate family&quot; that helped him through college, as of 2013 he had stopped communicating with the Rich family after Byrne&#x27;s mother allegedly referred to Rodman as a &quot;nigger&quot;.

==Professional basketball career==

=== Detroit Pistons (1986–1993) ===

====Early years and first championship (1986–1989)====

Rodman made himself eligible for the 1986 NBA draft. He was drafted by the Detroit Pistons as the third pick in the second round (27th overall), joining the rugged team of coach Chuck Daly that was called &quot;Bad Boys&quot; for their hard-nosed approach to basketball. The squad featured Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars at the guard positions, Adrian Dantley and Sidney Green at forward, and center Bill Laimbeer. Bench players who played more than 15 minutes per game were sixth man Vinnie Johnson and the backup forwards Rick Mahorn and John Salley. Rodman fit well into this ensemble, providing 6.5 points, 4.7 rebounds and some tough defense in 15.0 minutes of playing time per game.

Winning 52 games, the Pistons comfortably entered the 1987 playoffs. They swept the Washington Bullets and soundly beat the Atlanta Hawks in five games but bowed out in seven matches against the archrival Boston Celtics in what was called one of the physically and mentally toughest series ever. Rodman feuded with Celtics guard Dennis Johnson and taunted Johnson in the closing seconds when he waved his right hand over his own head. As the Celtics closed out Game Seven, Johnson went back to Rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture.

After the loss, Rodman made headlines by saying Celtics star Larry Bird was overrated because he was white. &quot;Larry Bird is overrated in a lot of areas...Why does he get so much publicity? Because he&#x27;s white. You never hear about a black player being the greatest&quot;. Although teammate Thomas supported him, he endured harsh criticism, but avoided being called a racist because, according to him, his own girlfriend Anicka &quot;Annie&quot; Bakes was white.

In the following 1987–88 season, Rodman steadily improved his stats, averaging 11.6 points and 8.7 rebounds and starting in 32 of 82 regular season games. The Pistons fought their way into the 1988 NBA Finals, and took a 3–2 lead, but lost in seven games against the Los Angeles Lakers. In Game Six, the Pistons were down by one point with eight seconds to go; Dumars missed a shot, and Rodman just fell short of an offensive rebound and a putback that could have won the title. In Game Seven, L.A. led by 15 points in the fourth quarter, but Rodman&#x27;s defense helped cut down the lead to six with 3:52 minutes to go and to two with one minute to go. But then, he fouled Magic Johnson, who hit a free throw, missed an ill-advised shot with 39 seconds to go, and the Pistons never recovered. In that year, he and his girlfriend Annie had a daughter they named Alexis.

Rodman remained a bench player during the 1988–89 season, averaging 9.0 points and 9.4 rebounds in 27 minutes, yet providing such effective defense that he was voted into the All-Defensive Team, the first of eight times in his career. He also began seeing more playing time after Adrian Dantley was traded at midseason to Dallas for Mark Aguirre. In that season, the Pistons finally vanquished their playoffs bane by sweeping the Boston Celtics, then winning in six games versus the Chicago Bulls—including scoring champion Michael Jordan—and easily defeating the Lakers 4–0 in the 1989 NBA Finals. Rodman was hampered by back spasms but dominated the boards, grabbing 19 rebounds in Game 3 and providing tough interior defense.

====Second championship and rebounding titles (1989–1993)====
In the 1989–90 season, Detroit lost perennial defensive forward Rick Mahorn, who was taken by the Minnesota Timberwolves in that year&#x27;s expansion draft and ended up on the Philadelphia 76ers when the Pistons could not reacquire him. It was feared that the loss of Mahorn – average in talent, but high on hustle and widely considered a vital cog of the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; teams – would diminish the Pistons&#x27; spirit, but Rodman seamlessly took over his role. Averaging 8.8 points and 9.7 rebounds while starting in the last 43 regular-season games, he established himself as the best defensive player in the game, lauded by the NBA &quot;for his defense and rebounding skills, which were unparalleled in the league&quot;. Rodman&#x27;s feats drew him his first big individual accolade: the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. He also had a .595 field goal percentage, best in the league. In the 1990 playoffs, the Pistons beat the Bulls again, and in the 1990 NBA Finals, Detroit met the Portland Trail Blazers. Rodman suffered from an injured ankle and was often replaced by Mark Aguirre, but even without his defensive hustle, Detroit beat Portland in five games and claimed their second title.

During the 1990–91 season, Rodman finally established himself as the starting small forward of the Pistons. He played such strong defense that the NBA said he &quot;could shut down any opposing player, from point guard to center&quot;. After coming off the bench for most of his earlier years, he started in 77 of the 82 regular-season games, averaged 8.2 points and 12.5 rebounds, and won his second Defensive Player of the Year Award. In the 1991 playoffs, the Pistons were swept by the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Bulls went on to win the championship.

In the 1991–92 season, Rodman made a remarkable leap in his rebounding. He collected an astounding 18.7 per game, winning his first of seven consecutive rebounding crowns, along with scoring 9.8 points per game, and making his first All-NBA Team. His 1,530 season rebounds (the most since Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s 1,572 in the 1971–1972 season) have not since been surpassed. (Kevin Willis, who grabbed 1,258 boards that same season, came closest. Willis lamented that Rodman had an advantage in winning the rebounding title with his lack of offensive responsibilities.) In a March 1992 game, Rodman grabbed a career-high 34 rebounds. However, the aging Pistons were eliminated by the up-and-coming New York Knicks in the first round of the 1992 playoffs.

Rodman experienced a tough loss when coach Chuck Daly, whom he had admired as a surrogate father, resigned in May; Rodman skipped the preseason camp and was fined $68,000. The following 1992–93 season was even more tumultuous. Rodman and Annie Bakes, the mother of his daughter Alexis, were divorcing after a short marriage, an experience which left him traumatized. The Pistons won only 40 games and missed the 1993 playoffs entirely.

Four years later in his biography &quot;Bad As I Wanna Be&quot;, Rodman revealed just how far he had fallen. He had driven to The Palace of Auburn Hills in February 1993 late one night carrying a loaded rifle in his truck, debating whether or not he wanted to continue living. Eventually he fell asleep in the truck, where he was found by police who had been called to perform a welfare check on Rodman by a friend. It was in that moment that he had an epiphany: &quot;I decided that instead [of killing myself] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn&#x27;t want to go ... So I just said, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to live my life the way I want to live it and be happy doing it.&#x27; At that moment I tamed [sic] my whole life around. I killed the person I didn&#x27;t want to be.&quot; The book was later adapted for a TV movie &quot;Bad As I Wanna Be: The Dennis Rodman Story&quot;. Although he had three years and $11.8 million remaining on his contract, Rodman demanded a trade. On October 1, 1993, the Pistons dealt him to the San Antonio Spurs.

=== San Antonio Spurs (1993–1995) ===

==== Playoff upset (1993–1994) ====
In the 1993–94 season, Rodman joined a Spurs team that was built around perennial All-Star center David Robinson, with a supporting cast of forwards Dale Ellis, Willie Anderson and guard Vinny Del Negro. On the hardwood, Rodman now was played as a power forward and won his third straight rebounding title, averaging 17.3 boards per game, along with another All-Defensive Team call-up. Living up to his promise of killing the &quot;shy imposter&quot; and &quot;being himself&quot; instead, Rodman began to show first signs of unconventional behavior: before the first game, he shaved his hair and dyed it blonde, which was followed up by stints with red, purple, blue hair and a look inspired from the film &quot;Demolition Man&quot;. During the season, he headbutted Stacey King and John Stockton, refused to leave the hardwood once after being ejected, and had a highly publicized affair with Madonna. The only player to whom Rodman related was reserve center Jack Haley, who earned his trust by not being shocked after a visit to a gay bar. However, despite a 55-win season, Rodman and the Spurs did not survive the first round of the 1994 playoffs and bowed out against the Utah Jazz in four games.

==== Team conflict and shoulder injury (1994–1995) ====
In the following 1994–95 season, Rodman clashed with the Spurs front office. He was suspended for the first three games, took a leave of absence on November 11, and was suspended again on December 7. He finally returned on December 10 after missing 19 games. After joining the team, he suffered a shoulder separation in a motorcycle accident, limiting his season to 49 games. Normally, he would not have qualified for any season records for missing so many games, but by grabbing 823 rebounds, he just surpassed the 800-rebound limit for listing players and won his fourth straight rebounding title by averaging 16.8 boards per game and made the All-NBA Team. The Spurs won 62 games.

However, things fell apart in the playoffs. During the second round series against the Los Angeles Lakers, Rodman was suspended for insubordination for sitting on the floor with his shoes off during a timeout. Despite this, the Spurs advanced to the Western Conference Finals against their division rivals, the Houston Rockets. The Rockets had only recorded 47 wins and had to come back from a 3-1 deficit to win their previous series against the Phoenix Suns, but the team was the defending NBA champion, and it was thought that Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon would have a hard time asserting himself versus Robinson and Rodman, who had both been voted into the NBA All-Defensive Teams.

The Spurs, however, were never able to stop Olajuwon as he averaged 35.3 points per game in the series. Rodman was particularly critical of Spurs coach Bob Hill&#x27;s play calling, saying that he coached the playoffs &quot;like we were playing Minnesota in the middle of December&quot; and that his idea that Rodman should assist Robinson, who he accused of freezing up in big moments, in defending Olajuwon was counterproductive because it would force him off his man and leave the Spurs prone to giving up scoring opportunities. He even went off on the organization, including general manager Gregg Popovich, in the locker room following a game, saying that everything they did &quot;sucked&quot; and that Hill was &quot;a loser&quot;. The Spurs would lose in six games, in a series Rodman said they &quot;could have and SHOULD have&quot; won.

Rodman admitted his frequent transgressions, but asserted that he lived his own life and thus a more honest life than most other people:

I just took the chance to be my own man ... I just said: &quot;If you don&#x27;t like it, kiss my ass.&quot; ... Most people around the country, or around the world, are basically working people who want to be free, who want to be themselves. They look at me and see someone trying to do that ... I&#x27;m the guy who&#x27;s showing people, hey, it&#x27;s all right to be different. And I think they feel: &quot;Let&#x27;s go and see this guy entertain us.&quot;

=== Chicago Bulls (1995–1998) ===

==== Third championship (1995–1996) ====

Before the 1995–96 season, Rodman was traded to the Chicago Bulls for center Will Perdue to fill a void at power forward left by Horace Grant, who had left the team before the 1994–95 season. Rodman could not wear No. 10 jersey because the Bulls had retired it for Bob Love, and the NBA denied him the reversion 01, Rodman instead picked the number 91, whose digits add up to 10. Although the trade for the already 34-year-old and volatile Rodman was considered a gamble at that time, the power forward quickly adapted to his new environment, helped by the fact that his best friend Jack Haley was also traded to the Bulls. Under coach Phil Jackson, he averaged 5.5 points and 14.9 rebounds per game, winning yet another rebounding title, and was part of the great Bulls team that won 72 of 82 regular season games, an NBA record at the time. About playing next to the iconic Jordan and co-star Scottie Pippen, Rodman said:

On the court, me and Michael are pretty calm and we can handle conversation. But as far as our lives go, I think he is moving in one direction and I&#x27;m going in the other. I mean, he&#x27;s goin&#x27; north, I&#x27;m goin&#x27; south. And then you&#x27;ve got Scottie Pippen right in the middle. He&#x27;s sort of the equator.

Although struggling with calf problems early in the season, Rodman grabbed 20 or more rebounds 11 times and had his first triple-double against the Philadelphia 76ers on January 16, 1996, scoring 10 points and adding 21 rebounds and 10 assists; by playing his trademark tough defense, he joined Jordan and Pippen in the All-NBA Defense First Team. On March 16, 1996, Rodman head butted referee Ted Bernhardt during a game in New Jersey; he was suspended for six games and fined $20,000, a punishment that was criticized as too lenient by the local press.

In the 1996 playoffs, Rodman scored 7.5 points and grabbed 13.7 rebounds per game and had a large part in the six-game victory against the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1996 NBA Finals: in Game Two at home in the Bulls&#x27; United Center, he grabbed 20 rebounds, among them a record-tying 11 offensive boards, and in Game Six, again at the United Center, the power forward secured 19 rebounds and again 11 offensive boards, scored five points in a decisive 12–2 Bulls run, unnerved opposing power forward Shawn Kemp and caused Seattle coach George Karl to say: &quot;As you evaluate the series, Dennis Rodman won two basketball games. We controlled Dennis Rodman for four games. But Game 2 and tonight, he was the reason they were successful.&quot; His two games with 11 offensive rebounds each tied the NBA Finals record of Elvin Hayes.

Rodman garnered much publicity for his public antics. In 1996, Rodman wore a wedding dress to promote his autobiography &quot;Bad As I Wanna Be&quot;, claiming that he was bisexual and that he was marrying himself.

==== Suspensions and fourth championship (1996–1997) ====
In the 1996–97 season, Rodman won his sixth rebounding title in a row with 16.7 boards per game, along with 5.7 points per game, but failed to rank another All-Defensive Team call-up. However, he made more headlines for his notorious behavior. On January 15, 1997, he was involved in an incident during a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. After tripping over cameraman Eugene Amos, Rodman kicked Amos in the groin. Though he was not assessed a technical foul at the time, he ultimately paid Amos a $200,000 settlement, and the league suspended Rodman for 11 games without pay. Thus, he effectively lost $1 million. Missing another three games to suspensions, often getting technical fouls early in games and missing an additional 13 matches due to knee problems, Rodman was not as effective in the 1997 playoffs, in which the Bulls reached the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. He struggled to slow down Jazz power forward Karl Malone but did his share to complete the six-game Bulls victory.

==== Fifth ring and Finals controversy (1997–1998) ====
The regular season of the 1997–98 season ended with Rodman winning his seventh consecutive rebounding title with 15.0 boards per game, along with 4.7 points per game. He grabbed 20 or more rebounds 11 times, among them a 29-board outburst against the Atlanta Hawks and 15 offensive boards (along with ten defensive) versus the Los Angeles Clippers. Led by the aging Jordan and Rodman (respectively 35 and 37 years old), the Bulls reached the 1998 NBA Finals, again versus the Jazz. After playing strong defense on Malone in the first three games, he caused major consternation when he left his team prior to Game Four to go wrestling with Hulk Hogan. He was fined $20,000, but it was not even ten percent of what he earned with this stint. However, Rodman&#x27;s on-court performance remained top-notch, again shutting down Malone in Game Four until the latter scored 39 points in a Jazz Game Five win, bringing the series to 3–2 from the Bulls perspective. In Game Six, Jordan hit the decisive basket after a memorable drive on Jazz forward Bryon Russell, the Bulls won their third title in a row and Rodman his fifth ring.

After the 1997–98 season, the Bulls started a massive rebuilding phase, largely at the behest of general manager Jerry Krause. Head coach Phil Jackson and several members of the team left via free agency or retirement, including Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Steve Kerr, and Jud Buechler. Rodman was released by the Bulls on January 21, 1999, before the start of the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season.

=== Los Angeles Lakers (1999) ===
With his sister acting as his agent at the time, Rodman joined the Los Angeles Lakers, for a pro-rated salary for the remainder of the 1998–1999 season. With the Lakers he played in only 23 games, in which he started in 11 of them and averaged 2 points and 11 rebounds per game and was released in the offseason.

=== Dallas Mavericks (2000) ===
In the 1999–2000 season, the then-38-year-old power forward Rodman was signed by the Dallas Mavericks, returning Rodman to his hometown. Dallas had won 10 of 13 before his arrival but went just 4–9 until he was waived by the Mavericks. He played 12 games, received six technical fouls, was ejected twice, and served a one-game suspension. While averaging 14.3 rebounds per game, above his career average of 13.1, Rodman alienated the franchise with his erratic behavior and did not provide leadership to a team trying to qualify for their first playoffs in 10 years. Dallas guard Steve Nash commented that Rodman &quot;never wanted to be [a Maverick]&quot; and therefore was unmotivated.

=== Long Beach Jam (2003–2004) ===

After his NBA career, Rodman took a long break from basketball and concentrated on his film career and on wrestling.

After a longer hiatus, Rodman returned to play basketball for the Long Beach Jam of the newly formed American Basketball Association during the 2003–04 season, with hopes of being called up to the NBA midseason. While he did not get that wish that season, he did help the Jam win the ABA championship in their inaugural season.

=== Fuerza Regia (2004) ===
Rodman also played in Mexico, with Fuerza Regia in 2004.

=== Orange County Crush (2004–2005) ===
In the following 2004–05 season, Rodman signed with the ABA&#x27;s Orange County Crush

=== Tijuana Dragons (2005–2006) ===
Rodman played the following season with the ABA&#x27;s Tijuana Dragons. In November 2005, he played one match for Torpan Pojat of Finland&#x27;s basketball league, Korisliiga.

=== Brighton Bears (2006) ===
The return to the NBA never materialized, but on January 26, 2006, it was announced that Rodman had signed a one-game &quot;experiment&quot; deal for the UK basketball team Brighton Bears of the British Basketball League to play Guildford Heat on January 28 and went on to play three games for the Bears. In spring 2006, he played two exhibition games in the Philippines along with NBA ex-stars Darryl Dawkins, Kevin Willis, Calvin Murphy, Otis Birdsong and Alex English. On April 27, they defeated a team of former Philippine Basketball Association stars in Mandaue City, Cebu and Rodman scored five points and grabbed 18 rebounds. On May 1, 2006, Rodman&#x27;s team played their second game and lost to the Philippine national basketball team 110–102 at the Araneta Coliseum, where he scored three points and recorded 16 rebounds.

On April 4, 2011, it was announced that Rodman would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Legacy in basketball==
From the beginning of his career, Rodman was known for his defensive hustle, which was later accompanied by his rebounding prowess. In Detroit, he was mainly played as a small forward, and his usual assignment was to neutralize the opponent&#x27;s best player; Rodman was so versatile that he could guard centers, forwards, or guards equally well and won two NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards. From 1991 on, he established himself as one of the best rebounders of all time, averaging at least 15 rebounds per game in six of the next seven years. Playing power forward as member of the Spurs and the Bulls, he had a historical outburst in the 1996 NBA Finals: he twice snared 11 offensive rebounds, equalling an all-time NBA record. In addition, he had a career-high 34-rebound game on March 4, 1992. Rodman&#x27;s rebounding prowess with Detroit and San Antonio was also aided by his decreased attention to defensive positioning and helping teammates on defense. Daly said Rodman was selfish about rebounding, but deemed him a hard worker and coachable. Rodman&#x27;s defensive intensity returned while with Chicago.

On offense, Rodman&#x27;s output was mediocre. He averaged 11.6 points per game in his second season, but his average steadily dropped: in the three championship seasons with the Bulls, he averaged five points per game and connected on less than half of his field goal attempts. His free throw shooting (lifetime average: .584) was considered a big liability: on December 29, 1997, Bubba Wells of the Dallas Mavericks committed six intentional fouls against him in only three minutes, setting the record for the fastest foul out in NBA history. The intention was to force him to attempt free throws, which in theory would mean frequent misses and easy ball possession without giving up too many points. However, this plan backfired, as Rodman hit 9 of the 12 attempts. This was Dallas coach Don Nelson&#x27;s early version of what would later develop into the famous &quot;Hack-a-Shaq&quot; method that would be implemented against Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Dwight Howard, and other poor free throw shooters.

In 14 NBA seasons, Rodman played in 911 games, scored 6,683 points, and grabbed 11,954 rebounds, translating to 7.3 points and 13.1 rebounds per game in only 31.7 minutes played per game. NBA.com lauds Rodman as &quot;arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history and one of the most recognized athletes in the world&quot; but adds &quot;enigmatic and individualistic, Rodman has caught the public eye for his ever-changing hair color, tattoos and, unorthodox lifestyle&quot;. On the hardwood, he was recognized as one of the most successful defensive players ever, winning the NBA championship five times in six NBA Finals appearances (1989, 1990, 1996–1998; only loss 1988), being crowned NBA Defensive Player of the Year twice (1990–1991) and making seven NBA All-Defensive First Teams (1989–1993, 1995–1996) and NBA All-Defensive Second Teams (1994). He additionally made two All-NBA Third Teams (1992, 1995), two NBA All-Star Teams (1990, 1992) and won seven straight rebounding crowns (1992–1998) and finally led the league once in field goal percentage (1989).

Rodman was recognized as the prototype bizarre player, stunning basketball fans with his artificial hair colors, numerous tattoos and body piercings, multiple verbal and physical assaults on officials, frequent ejections, and his tumultuous private life. He was ranked No. 48 on the 2009 revision of &quot;SLAM Magazine&quot;″s Top 50 Players of All-Time. In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Rodman as the 62nd greatest player in NBA history. Metta World Peace played one year with the 91 jersey number in homage to Rodman, who he described as a player who he liked &quot;on the court as a hustler, not when he kicked the cameraman.&quot;

==Professional wrestling career==
===World Championship Wrestling (1997–1999)===

Rodman took up his hobby of professional wrestling seriously and appeared on the edition of March 10 of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; with his friend Hollywood Hulk Hogan in World Championship Wrestling (WCW). At the March 1997 Uncensored event, he appeared as a member of the nWo. His first match was at the July 1997 Bash at the Beach event, where he teamed with Hogan in a loss to Lex Luger and The Giant. At the August 1997 Road Wild event, Rodman appeared as the Impostor Sting hitting Luger with a baseball bat to help Hogan win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.

After the 1997–98 season, where Rodman and the Chicago Bulls defeated Karl Malone and the Utah Jazz in the 1998 NBA Finals, Rodman and Malone squared off again, this time in a tag team match at the July 1998 Bash at the Beach event. He fought alongside Hulk Hogan, and Malone tagged along with Diamond Dallas Page. In a poorly received match, the two power forwards exchanged &quot;rudimentary headlocks, slams and clotheslines&quot; for 23 minutes. Rodman bested Malone again as he and Hogan picked up the win.

Rodman returned to WCW in 1999 and feuded with Randy Savage. This culminated in a match at Road Wild which Rodman lost.

===i-Generation Superstars of Wrestling and retirement (2000)===
On July 30, 2000, Rodman competed on the i-Generation Superstars of Wrestling pay-per-view event. He fought against i-Generation champion Curt Hennig in an Australian Outback match; Hennig won the match by disqualification. Following the match, Rodman refrained from wrestling at the top level and retired.

===Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Celebrity Championship Wrestling (2008)===
Rodman came out of retirement to appear as a contestant on &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Celebrity Championship Wrestling&quot;, broadcast on CMT. Rodman was the winner of the series, defeating other challengers such as Butterbean and Dustin Diamond.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2023) ===
Rodman made an appearance on the September 2 episode of AEW Collision, where he was confronted by Jeff Jarrett, Jay Lethal, Sonjay Dutt and Satnam Singh. During the segment he aligned himself with The Acclaimed and Billy Gunn and accompanied them to the ring the following night during All Out on September 3, 2023.

==Media appearances==

In 1995, Rodman appeared as himself in an episode of the CBS situation comedy &quot;Double Rush&quot;.

In 1996, Rodman had his own MTV reality talk show called &quot;The Rodman World Tour&quot;, which featured him in a series of odd-ball situations. That same year, Rodman had two appearances in releases by rock band Pearl Jam. A Polaroid picture of Rodman&#x27;s eyeball is on the cover of the album &quot;No Code&quot;, and &quot;Black, Red, Yellow&quot;, B-side of its lead single &quot;Hail, Hail&quot;, was written about Rodman and has him contribute a voice message.

A year later, he made his feature film debut in the action film &quot;Double Team&quot; alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme and Mickey Rourke. The film was critically panned and his performance earned him three Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst New Star, Worst Supporting Actor and Worst Screen Couple (shared with Van Damme). Rodman starred in &quot;Simon Sez&quot;, a 1999 action/comedy and co-starred with Tom Berenger in a 2000 action film about skydiving titled &quot;Cutaway&quot;. In 1998, he joined the cast of the syndicated TV show &quot;Special Ops Force&quot;, playing &#x27;Deke&#x27; Reynolds, a flamboyant but skilled ex-Army helo pilot and demolitions expert.

In 2005, Rodman became the first man to pose naked for PETA&#x27;s advertisement campaign &quot;Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur&quot;. That same year, Rodman traveled to Finland, at first, he was present at Sonkajärvi in July in a wife-carrying contest. However, he resigned from the contest due to health problems. Also in 2005, Rodman published his second autobiography, &quot;I Should Be Dead By Now&quot;; he promoted the book by sitting in a coffin.

Rodman became Commissioner of the Lingerie Football League in 2005.

Since his initial entry into acting, he has appeared in few acting roles outside of playing himself. Rodman has made an appearance in an episode of &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; playing the character of himself, except being a fellow alien with the Solomon family. He voiced an animated version of himself in the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror XVI&quot;.

Rodman has also appeared in several reality shows: in January 2006, Rodman appeared on the fourth version of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in the UK, and on July 26, 2006, in the UK series &quot;Love Island&quot; as a houseguest contracted to stay for a week. Finally, he appeared on the show &quot;Celebrity Mole&quot; on ABC. He wound up winning the $222,000 grand prize.

In 2008, Rodman joined as a spokesman for a sports website OPENSports.com, the brainchild of Mike Levy, founder and former CEO of CBS Sportsline.com. Rodman also writes a blog and occasionally answers members&#x27; questions for OPEN Sports.

In 2009, he appeared as a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. Throughout the season, each celebrity raised money for a charity of their choice; Rodman selected the Court Appointed Special Advocates of New Orleans. He was the fifth contestant eliminated, on March 29, 2009.

In 2013, he appeared again as a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. He raised $20,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and was the sixth contestant eliminated, on April 7, 2013.

In March 2013, Rodman arrived at the Vatican City during voting in the papal conclave for the selection of a new pope. The trip was organized by an Irish gambling company.

In July 2013, Rodman joined Premier Brands to launch and promote Bad Boy Vodka.

Rodman&#x27;s visits to North Korea were depicted in the 2015 documentary film &quot;Dennis Rodman&#x27;s Big Bang in Pyongyang&quot;.

In 2017, Rodman was featured on the alternative R&amp;B/hip-hop duo Mansionz&#x27;s self-titled album &quot;Mansionz&quot;. He provides vocals on the single &quot;Dennis Rodman&quot; and uncredited vocals on &quot;I&#x27;m Thinking About Horses&quot;. In 2020, Rodman again featured on a track named after him, on rapper ASAP Ferg&#x27;s &quot;Floor Sears II&quot; mixtape.

==Personal life==
Rodman had a highly publicized affair with Madonna in 1994. Madonna arranged to meet Rodman by interviewing him for &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine. They were intended to appear on the cover of the June/July 1994 issue, but it was shelved by the founder Quincy Jones. Rodman claimed that they attempted to conceive a child because Madonna had offered him $20 million to impregnate her.

===Family===
Rodman married his first wife Annie Bakes in September 1992. They began dating in 1987, and had a daughter. Their relationship was marred by infidelities and accusations of abuse. They divorced after 82 days.

On November 14, 1998, Rodman married model Carmen Electra at the Little Chapel of the Flowers in Las Vegas, Nevada. Nine days later, Rodman filed for an annulment claiming he was of &quot;unsound mind&quot; when they married. They reconciled, but Electra filed for divorce in April 1999. She later stated that it was an &quot;occupational hazard&quot; to be &quot;Rodman&#x27;s girlfriend&quot;.

In 1999, Rodman met Michelle Moyer, with whom he had a son, Dennis Jr. (&quot;DJ&quot;, b. April 25, 2001) and a daughter, Trinity (b. May 20, 2002). Moyer and Rodman married in 2003 on his 42nd birthday. Michelle Rodman filed for divorce in 2004, although the couple spent several years attempting to reconcile. The marriage was officially dissolved in 2012, when Michelle again petitioned the court to grant a divorce. It was reported that Rodman owed $860,376 in child and spousal support.

DJ started playing college basketball for Washington State in 2019. He later transferred to USC in 2023. His daughter Trinity is a professional soccer player for the Washington Spirit, and the United States national team. In a 2024 interview, Trinity rarely heard from him growing up and as an adult, saying, &quot;He’s not a dad. Maybe by blood, but nothing else.&quot;

On July 14, 2020, Rodman&#x27;s father Philander died of prostate cancer in Angeles City, Philippines, at age 79. Dennis had previously reconciled with his father in 2012 when he made a trip to the Philippines after years of being estranged.

===Alcohol issues===
Rodman entered an outpatient rehab center in Florida in May 2008. In May 2009, his behavior on &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; led to an intervention which included Phil Jackson as well as Rodman&#x27;s family and other friends. Rodman initially refused to enter rehabilitation because he wanted to attend the &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; reunion show. In 2009, Rodman agreed to appear on the third season of &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;. Rodman remained a patient at the Pasadena Recovery Center for the 21-day treatment cycle. A week after completion he entered a sober-living facility in the Hollywood Hills, which was filmed for the second season of &quot;Sober House&quot;. During episode seven of &quot;Sober House&quot;, Rodman was shown being reunited with his mother Shirley, from whom he had been estranged for seven years. During this same visit Shirley also met Rodman&#x27;s two children for the first time. On January 10, 2010, on the same day that &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; premiered, Rodman was removed from an Orange County (California) restaurant for disruptive behavior. In March 2012, Rodman&#x27;s financial advisor said, &quot;In all honesty, Dennis, although a very sweet person, is an alcoholic. His sickness impacts his ability to get work.&quot;

On January 15, 2014, Rodman again entered a rehabilitation facility to seek treatment for alcohol abuse. This came on the heels of a well-publicized trip to North Korea where his agent, Darren Prince, reported he had been drinking heavily and to an extent &quot;that none of us had seen before.&quot;

===Legal troubles===
Rodman has settled several lawsuits out of court for alleged sexual assault.

In August 1999, Rodman was arrested for public drunkenness and spent the night in jail after he got into an altercation at Woody&#x27;s Wharf in Newport Beach, California. The charges were eventually dropped.

On November 5, 1999, Rodman and his then-wife, Carmen Electra, were charged with misdemeanor battery after police were notified of a domestic disturbance. Each posted bail worth $2,500 and were released with a temporary restraining order placed on them. The charges were dropped the next month.

In December 1999, Rodman was arrested for drunk driving and driving without a valid driver&#x27;s license. In July 2000, Rodman pleaded guilty to both charges and was ordered to pay $2,000 in fines as well as attend a three-month treatment program.

In 2002, he was arrested for interfering with police investigating a code violation at a restaurant he owned; the charges were eventually dropped. After settling down in Newport Beach, California, the police appeared over 70 times at his home because of loud parties. In early 2003, Rodman was arrested and charged with domestic violence at his home in Newport Beach for allegedly assaulting his then-fiancée.

In April 2004, Rodman pleaded nolo contendere (no contest) to drunk driving in Las Vegas. He was fined $1,000 and ordered to serve 30 days of home detention. On April 30, 2008, Rodman was arrested following a domestic violence incident at a Los Angeles hotel. On June 24, 2008, he again pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor spousal battery charges. He received three years of probation and was ordered to undergo one year of domestic violence counseling as well as 45 hours of community service, which were to involve some physical labor activities.

On November 21, 2016, Rodman was charged with causing a hit and run accident, lying to police, and driving without a license following an incident on Interstate 5 near Santa Ana, California, in July. In February 2017, Rodman pleaded guilty to the charges. He was sentenced to three years of probation and 30 hours of community service. He was also ordered to pay restitution and donate $500 to the Victim Witness Emergency Fund.

In January 2018, Rodman was arrested for driving under the influence in Newport Beach. He pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges and received three years of probation.

In May 2019, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Newport Beach yoga studio owner Ali Shah accused Rodman of helping steal over $3,500 worth of items from the studio&#x27;s reception area, including a decorative geode. Rodman disputed the account, claiming the owner told him &quot;Dennis, get anything you want.&quot; No charges had been filed at the time of reporting.

On October 18, 2019, Rodman was charged with misdemeanor battery after slapping a man at the Buddha Sky Bar in Delray Beach, Florida.

Rodman was one of the victims of professional scam artist/fraudster Peggy Ann Fulford (Peggy King, Peggy Williams, Peggy Ann Barard, &quot;etc.&quot;), losing $1.24million, amongst the $5.79million in total she stole from him, Ricky Williams, Travis Best, Rashad McCants, Lex Hilliard and others. Fulford&#x27;s crimes included stealing funds Rodman believed were being distributed as child-support payments he owed to his first wife, contributing to an unsuspecting Rodmanin 2012being left trying to explain the missed payments in an Orange County, California, court; the issue was clarified when Fulford was indicted by the FBI in 2016. She continued her criminal activity until sentenced, in February 2018, to 10 years in prison and full financial restitution (unlikely) to her victims.

===Politics===
On July 24, 2015, Rodman publicly endorsed Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign. That same month, Rodman sent out an endorsement tweet, stating, &quot;Donald Trump has been a great friend for many years. We don&#x27;t need another politician, we need a businessman like Mr. Trump! Trump 2016.&quot;

In 2020, Rodman endorsed and campaigned for the presidential campaign of rapper Kanye West.

In 2024, Rodman endorsed Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. 

===North Korea visits===

On February 26, 2013, Rodman made a trip to North Korea with Vice Media correspondent Ryan Duffy to host basketball exhibitions. He met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Rodman and his travel party were the first Americans to meet Kim. He later said that Kim was &quot;a friend for life&quot; and suggested that President Barack Obama &quot;pick up the phone and call&quot; Kim, since the two leaders were basketball fans. On May 7, after reading an article in &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, Rodman sent out a tweet asking Kim to release American prisoner Kenneth Bae, who had been sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea. Kim released Bae the following year.

In July 2013, Rodman told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;: &quot;My mission is to break the ice between hostile countries. Why it&#x27;s been left to me to smooth things over, I don&#x27;t know. Dennis Rodman, of all people. Keeping us safe is really not my job; it&#x27;s the black guy&#x27;s [Obama&#x27;s] job. But I&#x27;ll tell you this: If I don&#x27;t finish in the top three for the next Nobel Peace Prize, something&#x27;s seriously wrong.&quot; On September 3, 2013, Rodman flew to Pyongyang for another meeting with Kim Jong Un. He said that Kim has a daughter named Kim Ju-ae, and that he is a &quot;great dad&quot;. He also noted that he planned to train the North Korean national basketball team. He stated that he is &quot;trying to open Obama&#x27;s and everyone&#x27;s minds&quot; and encouraged Obama to reach out to Kim Jong Un.

In December 2013, Rodman announced that he would visit North Korea again. He also said that he has plans to take a number of former NBA players with him for an exhibition basketball tour. According to Rory Scott, a spokesman for the exhibitions&#x27; sponsoring organization, Rodman planned to visit December 18–21 and train the North Korean team in preparation for January games. The games were scheduled for January 8 (Kim Jong Un&#x27;s birthday) and January 10, 2014. Included on the U.S. exhibition team were Kenny Anderson, Clifford Robinson, Vin Baker, Craig Hodges, Doug Christie, Sleepy Floyd, Charles D. Smith, and four streetballers. Rodman departed from Beijing on January 6. Among his entourage was Irish media personality Matt Cooper, who had interviewed Rodman a number of times on the radio.

Rodman made comments on January 7, 2014, during a CNN interview implying that Kenneth Bae was at fault for his imprisonment. The remarks were widely reported in other media outlets and provoked a storm of criticism. Two days later, Rodman apologized for his comments, saying that he had been drinking and under pressure. He added that he &quot;should know better than to make political statements&quot;. Some members of Congress, the NBA, and human rights groups suggested that Rodman had become a public relations stunt for the North Korean government. On May 2, 2016, Kenneth Bae credited Rodman with his early release. He said that Rodman&#x27;s rant raised awareness of his case and that he wanted to thank him for his expedited release.

On June 13, 2017, Rodman returned to North Korea on what was initially described as a sports-related visit to the country. &quot;My purpose is to go over there and try to see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea,&quot; he said. He added that he hoped to accomplish &quot;something that&#x27;s pretty positive&quot; during the visit. He met with national Olympic athletes and basketball players, viewed a men&#x27;s basketball practice, and visited a state-run orphanage. He was not able to meet with Kim Jong Un, but met instead with the nation&#x27;s Minister of Sports and gave him several gifts for Kim, including two signed basketball jerseys, two soap sets, and a copy of Donald Trump&#x27;s 1987 book &quot;&quot;.

Rodman posted a video on Twitter that was recorded before he left for the visit in which he and his agent describe the mission of the trip. &quot;He&#x27;s going to try to bring peace between both nations,&quot; said Rodman&#x27;s agent Chris Volo, referring to the strained relations between North Korea and the United States. Rodman added, &quot;That&#x27;s the main reason why we&#x27;re going. We&#x27;re trying to bring everything together. If not, at least we tried.&quot; The visit was sponsored by the cryptocurrency company PotCoin.

Rodman&#x27;s &quot;hoops diplomacy&quot; inspired the 20th Century Fox comedy &quot;Diplomats&quot;. Tim Story and Peter Chernin are set to produce the film, while Jonathan Abrams is reportedly writing the script.

Rodman visited North Korea again in June 2018. &quot;I&#x27;m just happy to be a part of&quot; the 2018 North Korea–United States summit, he said, &quot;because I think I deserve it.&quot;

There has been speculation that Rodman might be an intelligence officer working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on North Korea, with the CIA neither confirming nor denying existence of records concerning his employment.

====Presidential involvement suggested====
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; raised the question of whether President Donald Trump sent Rodman on his 2017 visit to negotiate the release of several American prisoners of North Korea or to open a back channel for diplomatic communications. The U.S. State Department, White House officials, and Rodman all denied any official government involvement in the visit. Rodman, who publicly endorsed Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, is a self-described longtime friend of the president and, as the article put it, &quot;Trump and Kim&#x27;s only mutual acquaintance.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; article stated, &quot;Multiple people involved in unofficial talks with North Korea say that the Trump administration has been making overtures toward the Kim regime, including trying to set up a secret back channel to the North Korean leader using &#x27;an associate of Trump&#x27;s&#x27; rather than the usual lineup of North Korea experts and former officials who talk to Pyongyang&#x27;s representatives.&quot;

When asked if he had spoken with Trump about the visit, Rodman replied, &quot;Well, I&#x27;m pretty sure he&#x27;s pretty much happy with the fact that I&#x27;m over here trying to accomplish something that we both need.&quot; Rodman publicly presented a copy of Trump&#x27;s book, &quot;The Art of the Deal&quot; to North Korean officials, as a personal gift for Kim Jong Un. In a Twitter video posted by Rodman, his agent Chris Volo said, &quot;He&#x27;s the only person on the planet that has the uniqueness, the unbelievable privilege of being friends with President Trump and Marshal Kim Jong Un.&quot; Rodman went on to say in the video that he wanted to bring peace and &quot;open doors between both countries.&quot;

Otto Warmbier, an American student held captive in North Korea for 17 months, was released to U.S. officials the same day as Rodman&#x27;s visit to North Korea. Despite the timeline of the two events, the U.S. State Department, The White House, and Rodman all flatly denied any diplomatic connection or coordination between Rodman&#x27;s visit and the U.S. government. The U.S. State Department said the release of Warmbier was negotiated and secured by high level U.S. diplomats including Joseph Yun, the State Department&#x27;s special envoy on North Korea. Warmbier, who was in a nonresponsive coma throughout much of his imprisonment in North Korea, died days after being returned to his family in the U.S.

In an emotional interview with Michael Strahan of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, Rodman expressed sorrow for the death of Warmbier and said, &quot;I was just so happy to see the kid released. Later that day, that&#x27;s when we found out he was ill. No one knew that.&quot; He added that he wished to give &quot;all the prayer and love&quot; to the Warmbier family and had contacted them and hoped to meet with them personally.

Rodman&#x27;s agent, Chris Volo, told ABC News that before they left for the 2017 trip, he had asked North Korean officials to release Warmbier as a symbol of good faith for any future sports-relations visits. &quot;I asked on behalf of Dennis for his release three times,&quot; Volo said.

In December 2017, Columbia University professor of neurobiology Joseph Terwilliger, who has accompanied Rodman to North Korea, argued that &quot;While I don&#x27;t suspect that very many Americans would have chosen him to be an emissary or international goodwill ambassador, Dennis has had a long friendship with Mr. Trump and has also developed a very cordial friendship with Mr. Kim. In this tense climate, as we stand at a perilous crossing, Mr. Rodman&#x27;s unique position as a friend to the leaders of both U.S. and North Korea could provide a much-needed bridge to help resolve the current nuclear standoff.&quot;

<text>Stephen Roche (; born 28 November 1959) is an Irish former professional road racing cyclist. In a 13-year professional career, he peaked in 1987, becoming the second of only three cyclists to win the Triple Crown of victories in the Tour de France and the Giro d&#x27;Italia general classification, plus the World road race championship, the others being Eddy Merckx and Tadej Pogačar. Roche&#x27;s rise coincided with that of fellow Irishman Sean Kelly.

Although one of the finest cyclists of his generation and admired for his pedalling style, he struggled with knee injuries and never contended in the Grand Tours post-1987. He had 58 professional career wins.

==Early life and amateur career==
On completion of his apprenticeship as a machinist in a Dublin dairy and following a successful amateur career in Ireland with the &quot;Orwell Wheelers&quot; club coached by Noel O&#x27;Neill of Dundrum (which included winning the Irish Junior Championship in 1977 and the Rás Tailteann in 1979), Roche joined the Athletic Club de Boulogne-Billancourt amateur team in Paris to prepare for the 1980 Olympic games in Moscow. Soon after his arrival Roche won the amateur Paris–Roubaix, escaping with Dirk Demol and sprinting to victory on the track at Roubaix. Roche was told by his directeur sportif that if he did not win he &quot;would be sent home to Ireland that day&quot;.

He also finished on the podium at the early-season Paris–Ezy road race and finished 14th overall in the Sealink International stage race which was won by Bob Downs. However, a knee injury caused by a poorly fitted shoe plate led to a disappointing ride in Moscow, where he finished 45th. However, on return to France, August to October saw Roche win 19 races. That led to a contract with the Peugeot professional cycling team for 1981.

==Professional career==
Roche scored his first professional victory by beating Bernard Hinault in the Tour of Corsica. Less than a month later he won Paris–Nice (where he became the first, and still the only, new pro to win Paris–Nice) despite illness following the descent from Mont Ventoux. He finished his debut season with victories in the Tour de Corse, Circuit d&#x27;Indre-et-Loire and Étoile des Espoirs races, with a second place behind Hinault in the Grand Prix des Nations. In total, his debut yielded 10 victories.

In 1982 his best performance was second in the Amstel Gold Race behind Jan Raas, but his rise continued in 1983 with victories in the Tour de Romandie, Grand Prix de Wallonie, Étoile des Espoirs and Paris–Bourges. In the 1983 Tour de France, Roche finished 13th and he finished the 1983 season with a bronze medal in the world cycling championship at Alterheim in Zurich.

In 1984, riding for La Redoute following contractual wrangles with Peugeot (the settlement of which led Roche to sport Peugeot shorts for two years before winning a court action against Vélo Club de Paris Peugeot) he repeated his Tour de Romandie win, won Nice-Alassio, Subida a Arrate and was second in Paris–Nice. He finished 25th in that year&#x27;s Tour de France.

In 1985, Roche won the Critérium International, the Route du Sud and came second in Paris–Nice and third in Liège–Bastogne–Liège. In the 1985 Tour de France Roche won stage 18 to the Aubisque and finished on the podium in 3rd position, 4 minutes and 29 seconds behind the winner Bernard Hinault.

===Chronic knee injury===
In 1986 at a six-day event with UK professional Tony Doyle at Paris-Bercy, Roche crashed at speed and damaged his right knee. This destroyed his 1986 season at new team with little to show other than second in a stage of the Giro. Roche finished the 1986 Tour de France 48th, 1h 32m behind Greg LeMond, a Tour that Roche described as like &quot;entering a dark tunnel&quot; of pain.

The injury and then associated back problems recurred throughout his career (for example in the 1989 Tour Roche abandoned after banging the problem knee on his handlebars) and a series of operations appeared to only address direct or consequential symptoms of the core injury. Later non-surgical intervention under Dr.Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt in Munich made some difference but the injury required constant care.

By the end of his career Roche was unable to compete at his best because of a back problem which led to a loss of power in the left leg. In retirement, he described riding the 1993 Tour de France &quot;just for fun&quot;. He finished 13th, riding for Claudio Chiappucci).

===1987 Triple Crown===

In 1987, Roche had a tremendous season. In the spring, he won the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana, taking a third victory in the Tour de Romandie and fourth place plus a stage win in Paris–Nice. He also finished second in Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the closest he got to winning a professional &#x27;Monument&#x27; Classic. He blamed it on tactical naiveté and &quot;riding like an amateur&quot;.

In the Giro d&#x27;Italia, Roche took three stage wins (including a team win with in the team time trial) en route to overall victory and became the first Giro victor from outside mainland Europe. Roche&#x27;s stage wins that year in the Giro were stage 1b, the time trial downhill on the Poggio into San Remo and stage 22, a individual time trial into St. Vincent. Despite his stage wins, the race is remembered for the stage from Lido di Jesolo to Sappada, where Roche, contravening team orders, broke away alone early and despite being caught late in the race, had the strength to go with the counterattack and take the pink jersey from his teammate Roberto Visentini, who had been previously leading the classification. His behaviour in the stage gained him the tifosi&#x27;s hatred. It was said the only member of his team that Roche could rely on not to ride against him was his domestique Eddy Schepers, although Roche recruited Panasonic riders and old ACBB teammates Robert Millar and Australian Phil Anderson to protect him with Schepers on the Marmolada climb (a day known as the &quot;Marmolada Massacre&quot;).

Roche finished the Giro exhausted but favourite for the Tour de France. Following Bernard Hinault&#x27;s retirement, Laurent Fignon&#x27;s choppy form and with Greg LeMond injured following an accidental shooting while hunting, the 1987 Tour was open. It was also one of the most mountainous since the war, with 25 stages. Roche won the individual time trial stage 10 to Futuroscope and came second on stage 19.

On stage 21, crossing the Galibier and Madeleine and finishing at La Plagne, Roche attacked early, was away for several hours but was caught on the last climb. His nearest rival Pedro Delgado then attacked. Despite being almost one-and-a-half minutes in arrears midway up the last climb, Roche pulled the deficit back to 4 seconds. Roche collapsed and lost consciousness and was given oxygen. When asked when revived if he was okay, he replied &quot;Oui, mais pas de femme toute de suite&quot; (&quot;yes, but I am not ready for a woman straight away&quot;).

The yellow jersey (worn by the leader of the general classification) changed hands several times with Charly Mottet, Roche, Jean François Bernard and Delgado all wearing it before Roche used the final time trial to overturn a half-minute gap and win the Tour by 40 seconds, which was at the time the second-narrowest margin (in 1968 Jan Janssen had beaten Herman Van Springel by 38 seconds; two years after Roche&#x27;s victory, Greg LeMond beat Laurent Fignon by 8 seconds). Roche became only the fifth cyclist in history to win the Tour and the Giro in the same year. He was also the only Irishman to win the Tour de France. Irish Taoiseach Charles Haughey joined Roche on the podium on the Champs-Élysées.

Later that year, with victory at the World road race championship in Villach in Austria, Roche became only the second to win the Triple Crown of Cycling. Roche arrived with insufficient training although he worked during the 23-lap, undulating terrain for his teammate Sean Kelly and escaped in the race-winning break only while covering for his countryman. With Moreno Argentin in the following group, Kelly did not chase and as the break slowed and jostling for position began for a sprint, Roche attacked from the finish and crossed the line with metres to spare.

Victory in the season-long &quot;Super Prestige Pernod International&quot; competition was assured.

Roche was given the freedom of Dublin in late September 1987. Several days later the 1987 edition of the Nissan Classic began and Roche rode strongly to finish second behind Kelly.

===Post-1987 career===

At the close of 1987, Roche moved to Fagor MBK, bringing English riders Sean Yates and Malcolm Elliot, 1984 Tour de France King of the Mountains winner Robert Millar and domestique Eddy Schepers. The team was criticised for containing too many English speakers.

The 1988 season began badly with a recurrence of the knee injury and Roche began a gradual decline. In 1989 he again took second in Paris–Nice (making four second places) and the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme. Roche finished the 1989 Giro d&#x27;Italia ninth behind Laurent Fignon. During the 1989 Tour de France, Roche withdrew due to his knee.

There were problems with his team and he changed again. In 1990, racing for Histor–Sigma, he won the Four Days of Dunkirk and in 1991 riding for Roger De Vlaeminck&#x27;s Tonton Tapis–GB brought victories in the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme and Critérium International. In the 1991 Tour de France, Roche missed the start for his team&#x27;s Team time trial and was forced to withdraw due to controversially missing the time cut.

In the Grand Tours, he was ninth in the 1989 Giro, and won a stage of the 1992 Tour de France in appalling conditions into La Bourboule (again racing for but now in support of Claudio Chiappucci) and en route to a final ninth place. Riding the last edition of the Nissan Classic Tour of Ireland, Roche was in many breaks but finished fifth. A year later, he was again ninth in the 1993 Giro d&#x27;Italia and 13th in the 1993 Tour de France.

Roche retired at the end of an anonymous 1993 which yielded a single win, in the post-Tour de France criterium at Chateau Chinon.

==Doping==

In May 1990, Paul Kimmage – a former professional and teammate of Roche at Fagor, as well as a fellow Dubliner – published an account of life in the peloton. His book &quot;Rough Ride&quot; exposed drug use apparently endemic in the peloton but spoke in fawning terms about Roche. Despite this, the publication resulted in a threat of litigation from Roche.

It was reported in the Rome newspaper, &quot;La Repubblica&quot;, in January 2000 that Francesco Conconi, a professor at the University of Ferrara involved with administering erythropoietin (EPO) to riders on the Carrera team with which Roche had some of his best years, had provided riders including Roche with EPO. Roche denied the allegations. This was further reported in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; several days later, Roche again denying EPO. In March 2000 the Italian judge Franca Oliva published a report detailing the investigation into sports doctors including Conconi. This official judicial investigation unequivocally found that Roche was administered EPO in 1993, his last year in the peloton.
Files from part of the investigation allegedly detail a number of aliases for Roche including Rocchi, Rossi, Rocca, Roncati, Righi and Rossini. In 2004 Judge Oliva again alleged that Roche had taken EPO during 1993 but due to the statute of limitations, neither Roche nor his teammates at Carrera would be prosecuted.

==Personal life==

Roche lives in Antibes on the Côte d&#x27;Azur. Roche remained involved in the sport by founding cycling camps in Majorca, taking part in race organisations and working as a commentator on cycling events for Eurosport.

He has four children with his former wife Lydia; the couple divorced in 2004. One son, Nicolas Roche, was a professional until his retirement in 2021, and was the 2009 and 2016 Irish National Road Race Champion.

Stephen&#x27;s brother Lawrence Roche was also a professional cyclist who completed his only Tour de France in 1991. They were teammates on the Tonton Tapis–GB team.

Roche&#x27;s nephew Dan Martin was also a professional cyclist and was the 2008 Irish National Road Race Champion.

Roche completed the 2008 New York Marathon in a time of 4:21:09.

In April 2022 a Spanish court found Roche guilty of fraud and ordered him to repay €733,866 to creditors of his bankrupt cycling holiday company in Majorca. The court determined he had funded his lifestyle with the company&#x27;s assets instead of paying back creditors.

==Advertisements==
Roche featured in a well-known Irish television advert for Galtee cheese in 1987, shortly after winning the Tour de France.

<text>Goodwill Industries International Inc., or simply Goodwill, is an American business that provides job training, employment placement services and other community-based programs for people who face barriers in their employment.

Goodwill Industries also hires veterans and individuals who lack job experience, an education, or face employment challenges. The business is funded by a network of 3,200+ retail thrift stores, operating as independent stores. Goodwill Industries operates as a network of independent, community-based organizations in Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Finland, Italy, South Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States, Uruguay and Venezuela, with 165 local Goodwill retail stores in the United States and Canada. It slowly expanded from its founding in 1902 and was first called Goodwill in 1915. In their 2018 fiscal year, Goodwill organizations generated $6.1 billion in revenue, of which $5.27 billion was spent on charitable services, and $646 million was spent on salaries and other operating expenses. Services constituted 89 percent of expenses. In 2015, the group served more than 37 million people, with more than 312,000 people placed into employment. Goodwill Industries&#x27; logo is a stylized letter g, resembling a smiling face, designed by Joseph Selame in 1968.

==Retail history==
In 1902, the Reverend Edgar J. Helms of Morgan Methodist Chapel in Boston started Goodwill as part of his ministry. Helms and his congregation collected used or discarded household goods and clothing from wealthier areas of the city, then trained and hired the unemployed or impoverished to mend and repair them. The products were then redistributed to those in need or kept by those who helped repair them. In 1915, Helms hosted a visit to Morgan Memorial by representatives of a workshop mission in Brooklyn, NY so they could learn the innovative programs and operating techniques of the &quot;Morgan Memorial Cooperative Industries and Stores, Inc.&quot; Helms was subsequently invited to visit New York. Out of these exchanges came Brooklyn&#x27;s willingness to adopt and adapt the Morgan Memorial&#x27;s way of doing things, while Helms was persuaded that &quot;Goodwill Industries”, the name for Brooklyn&#x27;s workshop, was preferable to the Morgan Memorial name. Morgan Memorial Goodwill Industries was created. Along with Brooklyn&#x27;s interest and ties, this became the foundation on which Goodwill Industries was to be built as an international movement. Goodwill has become an international nonprofit organization that, as of 2016, takes in more than $4.8 billion in annual revenue and provides more than 300,000 people with job training and community services each year. In 1999, George Kessinger, the head of Goodwill of Orange County during this time, started shopgoodwill.org. It is the first e-commerce auction platform created, owned, and operated by a nonprofit organization.

==Operations==

As of July 2011, there are 164 full Goodwill members in the United States and Canada. By 2006, Goodwill Industries International had a network of 207 member organizations in the United States, Canada, and 23 other countries. These are each independent social enterprises that operate their own regional Goodwill retail stores and job training programs. Morgan Memorial Goodwill Industries, Boston, is the enterprise operated in Boston, where Goodwill was founded.

The clothing and household goods donated to Goodwill are sold in more than 3,200 Goodwill retail stores, on its Internet auction site shopgoodwill.com, and eBay by a number of its regional stores.

When merchandise cannot be sold at a normal Goodwill store, it is taken to a &quot;Goodwill Outlet&quot; or &quot;Bargain Store&quot; where items are mostly sold by weight, with prices ranging from $0.49 to $1.89 per pound, depending on the location. The wide selection and massive discounts on a variety of household goods typically attract a fervent following of regular customers, some of whom make a full-time living buying and re-selling goods. Many vendors buy this merchandise in bulk and send the merchandise to third-world countries.

, CharityWatch rated the Goodwill Industries an &quot;A&quot;.

In January 2016, Goodwill Industries of Toronto, Eastern, Central, and Northern Ontario closed its 16 stores and 10 donation centres after 80 years of operations, citing cash problems. The six other Canadian Goodwill Industries Branches remain operational.

In 2019, Goodwill Industries of Northern Michigan announced that it is receiving a $1.25 million grant fund from the Amazon CEO&#x27;s Day One Families Fund.

In May 2022, Goodwill Industries International announced a $12 million investment in their Digital Career Accelerator. The donation made by Google.org of $7 million in direct grants and $7 million in search ads on Google aims to reach more than 2,000,000 people across the U.S. and Canada through infrastructure expansion to aid the development of digital skills and career training.

=== GoodwillFinds ===
In 2022, a consortium of local Goodwill organizations from across the US founded a new venture, launching in October 2022 the first nation-wide, centrally-managed online marketplace, GoodwillFinds.com, a site that allows consumers to purchase donated items from across the country in a single, branded, fixed-price, modern shopping experience. Matthew A. Kaness, a seasoned retail veteran, was hired to lead the venture, oversee its launch, and rapidly expand the new re-commerce platform. While many Goodwill member stores had previously sold some donations online, Goodwill was limited to in-store purchases, auction sites, or online stores like eBay and Amazon. The online store GoodwillFinds.com allows consumers to search by category, trend, price and donation location, and leverages AI to recommend pricing and enable personalization.

GoodwillFinds is a separate entity from Goodwill Industries International, but is a non-profit organization and shares the same mission as Goodwill. The online store is expected to raise awareness of the Goodwill brand to a new generation of shoppers, bringing in more donations as well as customers to participating Goodwills across the US.

=== Helms College and Edgar&#x27;s Hospitality Group ===
In 2021, MacKenzie Scott donated $10 million to Goodwill Industries of Middle Georgia (GIMG), the only Goodwill that includes an accredited vocational college: Helms College. The college and academic programms offer certificates, diplomas, and degrees in culinary arts, industrial trades, and medical services; it uses the restaurants within Edgar&#x27;s Hospitality Group as applied learning venues for its culinary students. It is named after Edgar Helms, founder of Goodwill. GIMG is the only Goodwill in the world operating a college and hospitality venue to serve the mission.

GIMG also dealt with former CFO Tim Ligon stealing $75,000 from the organization.

===Castro pop-up===
In November 2010, for the first time, Goodwill opened a store in San Francisco, California, specifically designed to hire employees who are transgender, gay, or lesbian. The temporary or &quot;Pop-up&quot; store was a unique partnership between Goodwill of San Francisco and the Transgender Economic Empowerment Initiative. The Castro Pop-up store closed in April 2011, and staff were transferred to various Goodwill stores throughout the San Francisco area.

===Women Veterans initiative===
In June 2013, Goodwill announced an initiative with the goal of engaging 3,000 women veterans as the organization helps them find jobs over the next two years. With this initiative, Goodwill aims to provide services and support that lead to economic self-sufficiency.

=== Evening of Treasures ===
Goodwill Industries of Greater New York holds an annual charity gala with many fashionable attendees and participants. The 2023 Evening of Treasures gala included the likes of Jenna Lyons (who hosted the event), Tommy Hilfiger, Todd Snyder, and Willy Chavarria, as participants. Designers executed upcycled looks using Goodwill thrift finds.

==Donation policies==

Goodwill has policies on donations, including items that it can accept. It will only accept items that can be resold, whether in the retail stores, online, or as bulk lots.

Goodwill stores generally do not accept donations such as automotive parts, furniture showing signs of damage, large appliances including stoves, refrigerators, washers/dryers, or exercise equipment. Most stores also do not accept hazardous materials such as paint, medications, or building materials such as doors, wood, nails, etc. For liability reasons, Goodwill generally does not accept baby cribs or car seats. Sanitary regulations prohibit accepting mattress donations, and although some Goodwill stores sell brand new mattresses, most locations are unable. Because of safety concerns, particularly lead content in painted products, some Goodwill stores do not accept certain toys.

==Criticism and compensation==

===Executive compensation===
In 2005, Goodwill Industries of the Columbia Willamette (GICW), Goodwill&#x27;s Portland, Oregon, branch, came under scrutiny due to executive compensation that the Oregon attorney general&#x27;s office concluded was &quot;unreasonable&quot;. The President of the Portland branch, Michael Miller, received $838,508 in pay and benefits for fiscal year 2004, which was reportedly out of line in comparison to other charity executives and placed him in the top one percent of American wage earners. After being confronted with the state&#x27;s findings, Miller agreed to a 24% reduction in pay, and GICW formed a new committee and policy for handling matters of employee compensation.

A 2013 article on Watchdog.org reported that Goodwill&#x27;s tax returns showed that more than 100 Goodwills pay less than minimum wage while simultaneously paying more than $53.7 million in total compensation to top executives. Douglas Barr, former CEO of the Goodwill of Southern California, was the highest paid Goodwill executive in the country. He received total compensation worth $1,188,733, including a base salary of $350,200, bonuses worth $87,550, retirement benefits of $71,050, and $637,864 in deferred compensation, after serving as CEO for 17 years. This is often incorrectly cited as his salary &quot;In 2011, the Columbia Willamette Goodwill, one of the largest in the country, says it paid $922,444 in commensurate wages to approximately 250 people with developmental disabilities. These employees worked 159,584 hours for an average hourly wage of $5.78. The lowest paid worker received just $1.40 per hour.&quot;

In 2016, an investigation by the &quot;Omaha World-Herald&quot; found that executives managing its local Goodwill stores received salaries of up to $400,000 with its CEO, Frank McGree, also collecting a 2014 bonus of $519,000—while over 100 of his store workers were paid less than minimum wage. The investigation found that 14 executives (including the CEO&#x27;s daughter) were paid more than $100,000, while only $557,000 of the enterprise&#x27;s $4,000,000 revenue went to &quot;programs&quot; for the disabled. Despite the organization claiming its profits were to assist the disabled acquire job opportunities, the paper&#x27;s investigators determined that, between 2011 and 2015, none of the store revenues supported job programs. Responding to the &quot;World&quot;&#x27;s investigation, Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson conducted an official investigation, finding that McGree&#x27;s salary was &quot;excessive&quot;, and concluded that there had become &quot;no correlation at all&quot; between what the area&#x27;s Goodwill&#x27;s executives were paid and how the organization was performing its true mission. However, Peterson concluded no laws had been broken that he could charge; instead, he urged the state legislature to enact oversight reforms to the regulation of non-profits.

In 2018, CEO Rich Cantz of Goodwill Northern New England (NNE) put out a video statement addressing the false &quot;Think Before You Donate&quot; rumors that alleged owner Mark Curran profits $2.3 million a year from the organization, and no money was going to charity. In the statement, he says that Goodwill NNE does give to charities and works to provide resources for brain injury rehabilitation centers, those with disabilities, and veterans seeking work. Further, the website states that &quot;Mark Curran&quot; is neither the owner nor CEO. As of 2020, Steven Preston is the CEO of Goodwill Industries International and has to report to a volunteer board of directors. In 2020, the stores in New England were still running a voiceover during shopping hours that reiterated this message to shoppers. The claims appeared in a longer email covering several for-profit and non-profit organizations, which was also debunked by Snopes.

===Workers&#x27; wages===
Goodwill Industries International has been criticized by some for using a provision of federal labor law to pay workers with disabilities less than the federal minimum wage. Under Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, organizations can obtain a &quot;special wage certificate&quot; to pay workers with disabilities a commensurate wage based on performance evaluations. Of Goodwill&#x27;s 105,000 employees, 7,300 are paid under the special wage certificate program. The National Federation of the Blind considers it &quot;unfair, discriminatory, and immoral&quot;. Other disability rights advocates have defended Goodwill&#x27;s use of the special wage certificate to employ workers with disabilities. Terry Farmer, CEO of ACCSES, a trade group that calls itself the &quot;voice of disability service providers&quot;, said scrapping the provision could &quot;force [disabled workers] to stay at home&quot;, enter rehabilitation, &quot;or otherwise engage in unproductive and unsatisfactory activities&quot;. Goodwill believes that the policy is &quot;a tool to create employment for people with disabilities&quot; who would not otherwise be employed. Goodwill notes that &quot;Eliminating it would remove an important tool for employers and an employment option available to people with severe disabilities and their families. Without the law, many people with disabilities could lose their jobs.&quot; Goodwill has urged Congress to &quot;support legislation that would strengthen the FLSA and increase its enforcement&quot;, and to &quot;preserve opportunities for people with disabilities who would otherwise lose the chance to realize the many tangible and intangible benefits of work&quot;. A 2013 FLSA fact sheet from Goodwill states that &quot;Without FLSA Section 14(c), many more people with severe disabilities would experience difficulty in participating in the workforce. These jobs provide individuals with paychecks that they would be unlikely to receive otherwise, as well as ongoing services and support, job security, and the opportunity for career advancement.&quot; Goodwill has updated this policy as of June 1, 2024, and currently only 9 out of 149 local Goodwills in the US still issue the certificates. The goal is to, &quot;transition people with disabilities employed under the special minimum wage certificate into competitive integrated employment.&quot;

===Lobbying===
A coalition of smaller charities in California had complained about Goodwill&#x27;s support for legislation encouraging greater regulation of donation boxes, calling the efforts an &quot;attempt to corner the clothing donation market and make more money&quot;. Local Goodwills have argued that donation boxes divert money from the community and contribute to blight, and have pushed for state legislation that requires owners of a donation box to clearly display information about whether it is a for-profit or nonprofit organization.

<doc id="355517" wikidata="Q3051017" url="?curid=355517" title="Ernie Banks">
<text>Ernest Banks (January 31, 1931 – January 23, 2015), nicknamed &quot;Mr. Cub&quot; and &quot;Mr. Sunshine&quot;, was an American professional baseball player who starred in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a shortstop and first baseman for the Chicago Cubs between 1953 and 1971. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977 in his first year of eligibility, and was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999.

Banks is regarded as being one of the greatest players of all time. He began playing professional baseball in 1950 with the Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro leagues. He served in the U.S. military for two years, played for the Monarchs again, and began his National League career in September 1953. The following year, Banks was the National League Rookie of the Year runner-up. Beginning in 1955, Banks was a National League (NL) All-Star for 11 seasons, playing in 13 of the 15 All-Star Games held during those years. Banks was the Cubs&#x27; main attraction in the late 1950s, the National League Most Valuable Player in 1958 and 1959, and the Cubs&#x27; first Gold Glove winner in 1960.

In 1962, Banks became a regular first baseman for the Cubs. Between 1967 and 1971, he was a player-coach. In 1969, through a &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; fan poll, Cubs fans voted him the greatest Cub ever. In 1970, Banks hit his 500th career home run at Wrigley Field. He retired from playing in 1971, was a coach for the Cubs in 1972, and in 1982 was the team&#x27;s first player to have his uniform number retired.

Banks was active in the Chicago community during and after his tenure with the Cubs. He founded a charitable organization, became the first black Ford Motor Company dealer in the United States, and made an unsuccessful bid for a local political office. In 2013, Banks was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama for his contribution to sports.

==Early life==
Banks was born in Dallas, Texas, to Eddie and Essie Banks on January 31, 1931; he was the second of twelve children. His father, who had worked in construction and was a warehouse loader for a grocery chain, played baseball for black, semi-professional teams in Texas. As a child, Banks was not very interested in baseball, preferring swimming, basketball and football. His father bought him a baseball glove for less than three dollars at a five and dime store and motivated him with nickels and dimes to play catch. While still in high school, Banks joined the Dallas Black Giants, a semi-pro baseball team, in 1949. His mother encouraged him to follow one of his grandfathers into a career as a minister.

Banks graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in 1950. He lettered in basketball, football and track. Banks&#x27; school did not have a baseball team; he played fastpitch softball for a church team during the summer. He was also a member of the Amarillo Colts, a semi-professional baseball team. History professor Timothy Gilfoyle wrote that Banks&#x27; talent for baseball was discovered by Bill Blair, a family friend who scouted for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League. Other sources say Banks was noticed by Cool Papa Bell of the Monarchs.

In 1951, Banks was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in Germany during the Korean War. He served as a flag bearer in the 45th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion at Fort Bliss, where he played with the Harlem Globetrotters on a part-time basis. In 1953, he was discharged from the army and joined the Monarchs for the remainder of that season, achieving a .347 batting average. Banks later said, &quot;Playing for the Kansas City Monarchs was like my school, my learning, my world. It was my whole life.&quot; Banks hosted a program on 1450 WHFC in the late 1950s.

==MLB career==
===Early career===
Banks signed with the Chicago Cubs in late 1953, making his major league debut on September 17 at age 22 and playing in 10 games at Wrigley Field. He was the Cubs&#x27; first black player; he became one of several former Negro league players who joined MLB teams without playing in the minor leagues. Larry Moffi and Jonathan Kronstadt wrote that he &quot;just was not the crusading type. He was so grateful to be playing baseball for a living, he did not have time to change the world, and if that meant some people called him an Uncle Tom, well, so be it.&quot;
During his first game for the Cubs, Banks received a visit from Jackie Robinson that influenced his quiet presence in baseball. Robinson told Banks, &quot;Ernie, I&#x27;m glad to see you&#x27;re up here so now just listen and learn ... For years, I didn&#x27;t talk and learned a lot about people&quot;. Later, when Banks felt like becoming more vocal, he discussed the issue with teammate Billy Williams, who advised him to remain quiet. Williams drew the analogy of fish that are caught once they open their mouths. Banks said, &quot;I kept my mouth shut but tried to make a difference. My whole life, I&#x27;ve just wanted to make people better&quot;.

In 1954, Banks&#x27; double play partner during his official rookie season was Gene Baker, the Cubs&#x27; second black player. Banks and Baker roomed together on road trips and became the first all-black double-play combination in major league history. When Steve Bilko played first base, Cubs announcer Bert Wilson referred to the Banks-Baker-Bilko double play combination as &quot;Bingo to Bango to Bilko&quot;. Banks hit 19 home runs and finished second to Wally Moon in Rookie of the Year voting. Banks participated in a trend toward lighter baseball bats after he accidentally picked up a teammate&#x27;s bat and liked that it was easy to generate bat speed.

In 1955, Banks hit 44 home runs, had 117 RBI and batted .295. He played and was the starting NL shortstop in his first of 13 All-Star Games that season. His home run total was a single-season record among shortstops. He also set a 30-year record of five single-season grand slam home runs. Banks finished third in 1955 in the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting, behind Roy Campanella and Duke Snider. The Cubs finished with a 72–81 win–loss record, winning 29 of 77 road games. In 1956, Banks missed 18 games due to a hand infection, breaking his run of 424 consecutive games played. He finished the season with 28 home runs, 85 RBIs, and a .297 batting average. He made the All-Star selection as a reserve player but did not play in the game. In 1957, Banks finished the season with 43 home runs, 102 RBI, and a .285 batting average.

In 1958 and 1959, Banks became the first NL player to be awarded back-to-back MVP Awards, leading the league in RBI in both those seasons (with 129 and 143, respectively). His 1958 season was also the first time an MVP winner was on a below-.500 team. Banks hit a major-league-leading (and a career best) 47 home runs in 1958, while batting .313, third best in the NL. The following year, he hit .304 with 45 home runs. In 1959, the Cubs came the closest to a winning season since Banks&#x27; arrival, finishing with a 74–80 record.

Banks had a small role in an unusual play on June 30, 1959, when the St. Louis Cardinals played the Cubs at Wrigley Field. Stan Musial was at the plate facing Bob Anderson with a count of 3–1. Anderson&#x27;s next pitch was errant, the ball evaded catcher Sammy Taylor and rolled all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called &quot;ball four&quot;, but Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with Anderson and Taylor, Musial tried to run for second base. Seeing that Musial was running to second, third baseman Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new baseball and gave it to Taylor. When Anderson noticed that Musial was trying for second, he took the new ball from Sammy Taylor and threw it towards Tony Taylor covering second base, and the ball went over Taylor&#x27;s head into the outfield. At the same time that Anderson threw the new ball towards second baseman Taylor, Dark threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see the throw and he was declared out when the tag was made.

In 1960, Banks hit a major league and NL-leading 41 HR, had 117 RBI, and led the NL in games played for the sixth time in seven years. He was also the first Cubs player to receive an annual NL Gold Glove award (for shortstop). On the eve of the 1960 World Series, Joe Reichler, a writer for the Associated Press, reported that the Milwaukee Braves were prepared to pay cash and trade pitchers Joey Jay, Carlton Willey and Don Nottebart, outfielder Billy Bruton, shortstop Johnny Logan and first baseman Frank Torre in exchange for Banks from the Cubs.

===Move to first base===
In 1961, Banks experienced problems with a knee injury he had suffered while in the army. After 717 consecutive games, he removed himself from the Cubs lineup for at least four games, ending his pursuit of the record for playing in the most consecutive NL games of 895 games set by Stan Musial. In May, the Cubs announced that Jerry Kindall would replace Banks at shortstop and that Banks would move to left field. Banks later said, &quot;Only a duck out of water could have shared my loneliness in left field&quot;. Banks credited center fielder Richie Ashburn with helping him learn to play left field; in 23 games Banks committed only one error. In June, he was moved to first base, learning that position from former first baseman and Cubs coach Charlie Grimm. He was not selected to be an All-Star for the first of two All-Star games that season since 1959, when MLB started having two All-Star Games per season through 1962, but was selected as a reserve player. Banks was a pinch hitter in the second All-Star game.
The Cubs began playing under the College of Coaches in 1961, a system in which decisions were made by a group of 12 coaches rather than by one manager. By the 1962 season, Banks hoped to return to shortstop but the College of Coaches had determined that he would remain at first base indefinitely. In May 1962, Banks was hit in the head by a fastball from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and was taken off the field unconscious. He sustained a concussion, spent two nights in a hospital, sat out a Monday game, and hit three home runs and a double on Tuesday.

In May 1963, Banks set a single-game record of 22 putouts by a first baseman. However, he caught mumps that year and finished the season with 18 home runs, 64 RBI, and a .227 batting average. Despite Banks&#x27; struggles that season, the Cubs had their first winning record since the 1940s. Banks, following his doctor&#x27;s orders, avoided his usual off-season participation in handball and basketball, and began the 1964 season weighing more than the previous year. Banks finished the season with 23 home runs, 95 RBI, and a .264 batting average. The Cubs finished in eighth place in 1964, losing over $315,000. In 1965, Banks hit 28 home runs, had 107 RBI, a .265 batting average, and played and started at first base in the All-Star Game. On September 2, he hit his 400th home run. The Cubs finished the season with a baseball operations deficit of $1.2 million, though this was largely offset by television and radio revenue, and the rental of Wrigley Field to the Chicago Bears football team.

The Cubs hired Leo Durocher as manager in 1966, hoping he could inspire renewed interest in the team&#x27;s fan base. Banks hit only 15 home runs; Cubs finished the 1966 season in last place with a 59–103 win–loss record, the worst season of Durocher&#x27;s career. From the time Durocher arrived in Chicago, he was frustrated at his inability to trade or bench the aging Banks. In Durocher&#x27;s autobiography, he says: ... [Banks] was a great player in his time. Unfortunately, his time wasn&#x27;t my time. Even more unfortunately, there was not a thing I could do about it. He couldn&#x27;t run, he couldn&#x27;t field; toward the end, he couldn&#x27;t even hit. There are some players who instinctively do the right thing on the base paths. Ernie had an unfailing instinct for doing the wrong thing. But I had to play him. Had to play the man or there would have been a revolution in the street.&quot;
Banks said of Durocher, &quot;I wish there had been someone around like him early in my career ... He&#x27;s made me go for that little extra needed to win&quot;. Durocher served as Cubs manager until mid-1972, the season after Banks retired. In his memoir &quot;Mr. Cub&quot;, published around the time that Banks retired, Banks said too much had been made of the racial implications in his relationship with Durocher:
My philosophy about race relations is that I&#x27;m the man and I&#x27;ll set my own patterns in life. I don&#x27;t rely on anyone else&#x27;s opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don&#x27;t care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black you will never be treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don&#x27;t feel this way. You can&#x27;t convince a fool against his will ... If a man doesn&#x27;t like me because I&#x27;m black, that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;ll just go elsewhere, but I&#x27;m not going to let him change my life.

The Cubs appointed Banks a player-coach for the 1967 season. Banks competed with John Boccabella for a starting position at first base. Shortly after, Durocher named Banks the outright starter at first base. Banks hit 23 home runs and drove in 95 runs, and went to the All-Star Game that year. After the 1967 season, an article in &quot;Ebony&quot; said Banks was not thought to have made more than $65,000 (equal to $ today) in any season. He had received a pay increase from $33,000 to $50,000 between his MVP seasons in 1958 and 1959, but &quot;Ebony&quot; said several MLB players were making $100,000 at the time.

===Final seasons===

Banks won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award in 1968, an honor recognizing playing ability and personal character. The 37-year-old Banks hit 32 home runs, had 83 RBI, and finished that season with a .246 batting average. In 1969, he came the closest to helping the Cubs win the NL pennant; the Cubs fell from first place after holding an -game lead in August. Banks made his 11th and final All-Star season appearance as a pinch hitter; it was his 14th All-Star Game appearance overall. Banks hit his 500th home run on May 12, 1970, at Chicago&#x27;s Wrigley Field. On December 1, 1971, Banks retired as a player but continued to coach for the Cubs until 1973. He was an instructor in the minor leagues for the next three seasons and also worked in the Cubs&#x27; front office.

Banks finished his career with 512 home runs; his 277 home runs as a shortstop were a career record at the time of his retirement. (Cal Ripken Jr. now holds the record for most home runs as a shortstop with 345.) Banks holds Cubs records for games played (2,528), at-bats (9,421), extra-base hits (1,009) and total bases (4,706). Banks also excelled as an infielder; he won an NL Gold Glove Award for shortstop in 1960. He led the NL in putouts five times and was the NL leader in fielding percentage as shortstop three times, and once as first baseman.

Banks holds the major league record for most games played without a postseason appearance (2,528). In his memoir, citing his fondness for the Cubs and owner Philip K. Wrigley, Banks said he did not regret signing with the Cubs rather than one of the more successful baseball franchises. Banks&#x27; popularity and positive attitude led to the nicknames &quot;Mr. Cub&quot; and &quot;Mr. Sunshine&quot;. Banks was known for his catchphrase, &quot;It&#x27;s a beautiful day for a ballgame ... Let&#x27;s play two!&quot;, expressing his wish to play a doubleheader every day out of his love of baseball.

==Personal life==
In 1953, after returning from military service in Germany, Banks married his first wife Mollye Ector. He proposed to her in a letter from Germany. Although he filed for divorce two years later, the couple briefly reconciled in early 1959. By that summer, they agreed on a divorce settlement that would pay $65,000 to Ector in lieu of alimony. Shortly thereafter, Banks eloped with Eloyce Johnson. The couple had twin sons within a year and a daughter four years after that. Ector filed suit against Banks in 1963 for failure to make payments on a life insurance policy agreed upon in their divorce settlement.

Banks was a lifelong Republican – and he also once stated that &quot;I&#x27;m not goin&#x27; anywhere I&#x27;m not wanted&quot; – prompting critics to claim that he was &quot;soft&quot; on Jim Crow; he ran for alderman in Chicago in 1963. He ran in the 8th Ward against Democratic incumbent James A. Condon. In the Feb. 26 primary, Banks finished a distant third, garnering just 12% of the vote (Condon won re-election with 55%; Gerald Gibbons drew 25%). He later said, &quot;People knew me only as a baseball player. They didn&#x27;t think I qualified as a government official and no matter what I did I couldn&#x27;t change my image ... What I learned, was that it was going to be hard for me to disengage myself from my baseball life and I would have to compensate for it after my playing days were over.&quot; Banks endorsed George W. Bush for president in 2004.

In 1966, Banks worked for Seaway National Bank in the off-season and enrolled in a banking correspondence course. He bought into several business ventures, including a gas station, during his playing career. Though he had been paid modestly in comparison to other baseball stars, Banks had taken the advice of Wrigley and invested much of his earnings. He later spent time working for an insurance company and for New World Van Lines. Banks began building assets that would be worth an estimated $4 million by the time he was 55 years old.

Banks and Bob Nelson became the first black owners of a U.S. Ford Motor Company dealership in 1967, Ernie Banks Ford on Chicago&#x27;s south side. Nelson had been the first non-white commissioned officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II; he operated an import car dealership before the venture with Banks. Banks was appointed to the board of directors of the Chicago Transit Authority in 1969. On a trip to Europe, Banks visited the Pope, who presented him with a medal that became a prized possession.

Banks was divorced from Eloyce in 1981. She received several valuable items from his playing career as part of their divorce settlement, including his 500th home run ball. She sold the items not long after the divorce. He remarried in 1984. In 1993, his third wife Marjorie was part of a group that met with MLB executives to discuss race relations in baseball after allegations of racial slurs surfaced against Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott. Banks married Liz Ellzey in 1997 and Hank Aaron served as his best man. In late 2008, Banks and Ellzey adopted an infant daughter.

Banks&#x27;s nephew, Bob Johnson, was a major league catcher and first baseman for the Texas Rangers between 1981 and 1983. His great nephew, Acie Law, is a professional basketball player who attended Texas A&amp;M University before playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

==Later years==
In 1969, Banks had been appointed to the Chicago Transit Board (the Chicago Transit Authority&#x27;s governing and administrative body) by the governor of Illinois. He would continue to serve on the board until 1981.

Banks served as a team ambassador after his retirement, though author Phil Rogers says the team had never placed Banks in a position of authority or significant influence. In 1983, shortly after Wrigley sold the team to the Tribune Company, Banks and the Cubs briefly severed ties. Rogers wrote that after the sale, Banks was viewed as &quot;something of a crazy uncle who hung around the house for no apparent reason&quot;, and that team officials anonymously told the press that Banks had been fired because he was unreliable. At the time, he was employed as the Cubs&#x27; corporate sales representative. Soon Banks and the Cubs reconciled and he resumed making appearances on behalf of the team.

In 1984, when the Cubs won the NL East division, the club named Banks an honorary team member. At the 1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the first one held at Wrigley Field since Banks&#x27; playing days, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch to starting catcher Mike Scioscia.

In 2003, he guest starred on an episode of &quot;Yes, Dear&quot;.

In June 2006, &quot;Crain&#x27;s Chicago Business&quot; said Banks was part of a group looking into buying the Chicago Cubs in case the Tribune Company decided to sell the club. Banks established a charity, the Live Above &amp; Beyond Foundation, which assists youth and the elderly with issues including self-esteem and healthcare. In 2008, Banks released a charity wine called Ernie Banks 512 Chardonnay, the proceeds of which were donated to his foundation.

Banks was an ordained minister; he presided at the wedding of MLB pitcher Sean Marshall. On March 31, 2008, a statue of Banks (&quot;Mr. Cub&quot;) was unveiled in front of Wrigley Field. That year, Eddie Vedder released a song called &quot;All The Way&quot;, which Banks had asked Vedder to write about the Cubs as a birthday gift.

Banks remained close to the Cubs team and made frequent appearances at their spring training grounds, HoHoKam Stadium in Arizona. Author Harry Strong wrote in 2013 that &quot;the Chicago Cubs do not have a mascot, but they hardly need one when the face of the franchise is still so visible&quot;.

===Death===
Banks died of a heart attack at a Chicago hospital on January 23, 2015, eight days before his 84th birthday. Following a public visitation, a memorial service was held at the Fourth Presbyterian Church. Several well-known people spoke at the service, including Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel and baseball personalities Joe Torre and Billy Williams. After the service, a procession moved from Downtown Chicago past Wrigley Field.

In the weeks after his death, a legal battle arose over Banks&#x27; estate and the disposition of his body. His estranged widow Elizabeth said that he had amended his will in October without her knowledge. The new will left all of Banks&#x27; assets to his longtime caregiver, Regina Rice. Banks had been diagnosed with dementia shortly before the change in his will. A Chicago funeral home sent Elizabeth a bill for $35,000 in funeral costs, but the bill went unpaid as Elizabeth challenged the legality of Banks&#x27; new will. In March 2015, the Chicago Cubs announced that they would pay the funeral home costs.

Banks was buried in Graceland Cemetery, near Wrigley Field, beneath a monument that pay tribute to his sports and public career. During the entire 2015 season, the Cubs had the number 14 located behind home plate.

==Honors and legacy==
Banks was voted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in , his first year of eligibility. He received votes on 321 of the 383 ballots. Though several players were selected through the Veterans Committee and the Special Committee on the Negro Leagues that year, Banks was the only player elected by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America. He was inducted on August 8 of that year. Banks ended his induction speech with his famous catchphrase:

The Cubs retired Banks&#x27; uniform number 14 in 1982. He was the first player to have his number retired by the team. The team did not retire any more numbers for another five years, when Billy Williams received the honor. Through the 2023 season only six former Cubs, along with Brooklyn Dodger Jackie Robinson, have had their numbers retired by the organization.

Banks was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. That same year, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; ranked him number 38 on its list of &quot;Baseball&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players&quot;. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Banks at number 65 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

In 2022, as part of their SN Rushmore project, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named Banks on their &quot;Chicago Mount Rushmore of Sports&quot;, along with Chicago Bulls basketball player Michael Jordan, Chicago Bears football player Walter Payton, and Chicago Blackhawks hockey player Bobby Hull.

He was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1970, in the area of Sports.

In 2009, Banks was named a Library of Congress Living Legend, a designation that recognizes those &quot;who have made significant contributions to America&#x27;s diverse cultural, scientific and social heritage&quot;. In 2013, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom with 15 other people, including Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey. During the ceremony, he presented President Obama with a bat that had belonged to Jackie Robinson.

<doc id="355519" wikidata="Q153024" url="?curid=355519" title="Rita of Cascia">
<text>Rita of Cascia, OSA (born Margherita Ferri Lotti; 1381 – 22 May 1457), was an Italian widow and Augustinian nun. After Rita&#x27;s husband died, she joined a small community of nuns, who later became Augustinians, where she was known both for practicing mortification of the flesh and for the efficacy of her prayers. Various miracles are attributed to her intercession, and she is often portrayed with a bleeding wound on her forehead, which is understood to indicate a partial stigmata.

Pope Leo XIII canonized Rita on 24 May 1900. Her feast day is celebrated on 22 May. At her canonization ceremony, she was bestowed the title of &quot;Patroness of Impossible Causes&quot;, while in many Catholic countries, Rita came to be known as the patroness of abused wives and heartbroken women. Her bodily remains lie in the Basilica of Santa Rita da Cascia.

== Early life ==


Margherita Lotti was born in 1381 in the city of Roccaporena, a small hamlet near Cascia, Umbria where various sites connected with her are the focus of pilgrimages. Her name, Margherita, means &quot;pearl&quot;. She was affectionately called Rita, the short form of her baptismal name. Her parents, Antonio and Amata Ferri Lotti, were known to be noble, charitable people, who gained the epithet &quot;Conciliatori di Cristo&quot; (English: &quot;Peacemakers of Christ&quot;).

According to pious accounts, Rita was originally pursued by a notary named Gubbio but she resisted his offer. She was married at age twelve to a nobleman named Paolo di Ferdinando di Mancino. Her marriage was arranged by her parents, a common practice at the time, despite her repeated requests to be allowed to enter a convent of religious sisters. Her husband, Paolo Mancini, was known to be a rich, quick-tempered, immoral man, who had many enemies in the region of Cascia. The marriage lasted for eighteen years, during which she was remembered for her Christian values as a model wife and mother who made efforts to convert her husband from his abusive behavior.

Rita endured his insults, physical abuse and infidelities for many years. According to popular tales, through humility, kindness and patience, Rita was able to convert her husband into a better person, more specifically renouncing a family feud known at the time as &quot;La Vendetta&quot;. Rita eventually bore two sons, Giangiacomo (Giovanni) Antonio and Paulo Maria, and brought them up in the Christian faith. As time went by and the family feud between the Chiqui and Mancini families became more intense, Paolo Mancini became congenial, but his allies betrayed him and he was stabbed to death by Guido Chiqui, a member of the feuding family.

Rita gave a public pardon at Paolo&#x27;s funeral to her husband&#x27;s murderers. Paolo Mancini&#x27;s brother, Bernardo, was said to have continued the feud and hoped to convince Rita&#x27;s sons to seek revenge. Bernardo convinced Rita&#x27;s sons to leave their manor and live at the Mancini villa ancestral home. As her sons grew, their characters began to change as Bernardo became their tutor. Rita&#x27;s sons wished to avenge their father&#x27;s murder. Rita, fearing that her sons would lose their souls, tried to dissuade them from retaliating, but to no avail. She asked God to remove her sons from the cycle of vendettas and prevent mortal sin and murder. Her sons died of dysentery a year later, which pious Catholics believe was God&#x27;s answer to her prayer, taking them by natural death rather than risk them committing a mortal sin punishable by Hell.

After the deaths of her husband and sons, Rita desired to enter the monastery of Saint Mary Magdalene in Cascia, but was turned away. Although the convent acknowledged Rita&#x27;s good character and piety, the nuns were afraid of being associated with her due to the scandal of her husband&#x27;s violent death and because she was not a virgin. However, Rita persisted in her cause and was given a condition before the convent could accept her: the task of reconciling her family with her husband&#x27;s murderers. She implored her three patron saints (John the Baptist, Augustine of Hippo, and Nicholas of Tolentino) to assist her, and she set about the task of establishing peace between the hostile parties of Cascia. Popular religious tales recall that the bubonic plague, which ravaged Italy at the time, infected Bernardo Mancini, causing him to relinquish his desire to feud any longer with the Chiqui family. She was able to resolve the conflicts between the families and, at the age of thirty-six, was allowed to enter the monastery.

Pious Catholic legends later recount that Rita was transported into the monastery of Saint Magdalene via levitation at night into the garden courtyard by her three patron saints. She remained at the monastery, living by the Augustinian Rule, until her death from tuberculosis on 22 May 1457.

== Veneration ==
The Augustinian Father Agostino Cavallucci from Foligno wrote the first biography of Rita based on oral tradition. The Vita was published in 1610 by Matteo Florimi in Siena. The work was composed long before her beatification, but the title page nevertheless refers to Rita as already ‘blessed’. Another &quot;Acta&quot; or life story of the woman was compiled by the Augustinian priest Jacob Carelicci. Rita was also mentioned in a 1641 French volume on important Augustinians by Simplicien Saint-Martin.

Rita was beatified by Pope Urban VIII in 1626. The pope&#x27;s private secretary, Fausto Poli, had been born some fifteen kilometers (nine miles) from her birthplace and much of the impetus behind her cult is due to his enthusiasm. 

She was canonized on 24 May 1900 by Pope Leo XIII. Her feast day is 22 May. The three required miracles that led to her canonization are the following: the pleasant scent emanating from her incorruptible body; the cure of smallpox and the sudden recovery of sight of the young Elizabeth Bergamini, who had been staying for four months in the convent of Cascia, asking for Blessed Rita&#x27;s intercession; and finally, the complete and sudden healing of Cosma Pellegrini in 1887, suffering from chronic catarrhal gastro-enteritis and an incurable hemorrhoidal affection, after having received a vision of the Blessed Rita on his deathbed. On the 100th anniversary of her canonization in 2000, Pope John Paul II noted her remarkable qualities as a Christian woman: &quot;Rita interpreted well the &#x27;feminine genius&#x27; by living it intensely in both physical and spiritual motherhood.&quot;

Rita has acquired the reputation, together with St. Philomena and St. Jude, as a saint of impossible causes. She is also the patron saint of sterility, abuse victims, loneliness, marriage difficulties, parenthood, widows, the sick, bodily ills, and wounds.

Augustinians claim that Rita&#x27;s body has remained incorrupt over the centuries, and it is venerated today in the shrine at Cascia which bears her name. Part of her face has been slightly repaired with wax. Many people visit her tomb each year from all over the world. French painter Yves Klein had been dedicated to her as an infant. In 1961, he created a Shrine of St. Rita, which is in Cascia Convent.

== Iconography ==

Various religious symbols are related to Rita. She is depicted holding a thorn (a symbol of her penance and stigmata) or crown of thorns, holding a large Crucifix, often with roses. She may also have a forehead wound.

=== The forehead wound ===
When Rita was approximately sixty years of age, she was meditating before an image of Christ crucified. Suddenly, a small wound appeared on her forehead, as though a thorn from the crown that encircled Christ&#x27;s head had loosened itself and penetrated her own flesh. It was considered to be a partial Stigmata, and she bore this external sign of union with Christ until her death in 1457. 

At the time of her death, the sisters of the convent bathed and dressed her body for burial. They noticed that her forehead wound remained the same, with drops of blood still reflecting light. When her body was later exhumed, it was noted that her forehead wound still remained the same, with the glistening light reflected from the drops of blood. Her body showed no signs of deterioration. Over several years, her body was exhumed two more times. Each time, her body appeared the same. She was declared an incorruptible after the third exhumation. Relics were taken at that time as is the custom in the Catholic Church in preparation for sainthood.

=== Roses ===
It is said that near the end of her life Rita was bedridden at the convent. While visiting her, a cousin visiting from Roccaporena asked if she desired anything from her old home. Rita responded by asking for a rose from the garden. It was January, and her cousin did not expect to find one due to the season. However, when her relative went to the house, a single blooming rose was found in the garden, and her cousin brought it back to Rita at the convent. 

St. Rita is often depicted holding roses or with roses nearby. On her feast day, churches and shrines of St. Rita provide roses to the congregation that are blessed by the priest during Mass.

=== The Bees ===
In the parish church of Laarne, near Ghent, Belgium, there is a statue of Rita in which several bees are featured. This depiction originates from the story of her baptism as an infant. On the day after her baptism, her family noticed a swarm of white bees flying around her as she slept in her crib. However, the bees peacefully entered and exited her mouth without causing her any harm or injury. Instead of being alarmed for her safety, her family was mystified by this sight. According to Butler, this was taken to indicate that the career of the child was to be marked by industry, virtue, and devotion.

== Legacy ==
In the 20th century, a large sanctuary was built for Rita in Cascia. The sanctuary and the house where she was born are among the most active pilgrimage sites of Umbria.

The National Shrine of Saint Rita of Cascia in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was built in 1907 and is a popular pilgrimage and devotional site.

French singer Mireille Mathieu adopted Rita as her patron saint on the advice of her paternal grandmother. In her autobiography, Mathieu describes buying a candle for Rita using her last franc. Though Mathieu claims that her prayers were not always answered, she testifies that they inspired her to become a strong and determined woman.

In 1943, &quot;Rita of Cascia&quot;, a film based on Rita&#x27;s life, was made, starring Elena Zareschi. The story of Rita increased in popularity due to a 2004 film titled &quot;Santa Rita da Cascia&quot;, filmed in Florence, Italy. The latter film altered the facts of Rita&#x27;s early life.

Rita is often credited as also being the unofficial patron saint of baseball due to a reference made to her in the 2002 film &quot;The Rookie&quot;.

The 2019 science fiction novella &quot;Sisters of the Vast Black&quot; features a fictional group of nuns known as the Order of Saint Rita.

St. Rita&#x27;s Church is located in Nanthirickal, Kollam district, in the state of Kerala, India. It is the only church in Asia to have relics of Saint Rita. It is the only Catholic church in Kerala named after St. Rita.

<text>Easterseals (formerly known as Easter Seals; founded in 1919 as the National Society for Crippled Children) is an American 501(c)(3) nonprofit providing disability services, with additional support areas serving veterans and military families, seniors, and caregivers.

==Services==
Easterseals has a network of locations across the United States. Services assist people with physical disabilities, mental disabilities, and special needs. Parents can find support for a child who has a diagnosis at birth and there are services for people who have a disability due to disease, injury, or aging.

Easterseals&#x27; offerings are categorized into support areas:
*Enhancing health – helping individuals and families to achieve life goals through autism services, rehabilitation services, mental health support and housing.
*Enriching education – helping children and adults gain skills to live a fulfilled life through assistive technology, child care and early intervention services.
*Expanding employment – helping people with disabilities, older workers, and veterans prepare for employment.
*Elevating community – providing fun activities for adults and children to build community, relax and rejuvenate through camp and recreation programs.

==Fundraising==
90% of funds raised go to Easterseals disability services across the nation. Easterseals&#x27; funding sources include government grants and agency programs, donations, and fee-for-service initiatives. Donations help the organization provide affordable offerings to clients while maintaining program costs. Easterseals serves about 1.3 million individuals per year.

The name &quot;Easter Seals&quot; derived from an earlier fundraising program: beginning in 1934, colorful adhesive seals, the size of postage stamps, were sold around Easter; purchasers stuck these on the back of mailed envelopes, as a popular tradition was to send cards to friends and family both at Christmas and Easter seasons. Because of the program&#x27;s success, the organization changed its name from &quot;the National Society for Crippled Children&quot; to &quot;Easter Seals.&quot; They have since changed their name to &quot;Easterseals.&quot;

In 2003, Easterseals started &quot;Walk With Me&quot; events across the country. Thousands of people have attended these events over the years, generating millions of dollars for disability services.

In 2010, Easterseals expanded the &quot;seal&quot; program through introducing the &quot;Easterseals Blanket.&quot; The image on the blanket is chosen through an online vote for the Lily Seal of the Year. Artists submit depictions of lilies to be featured on the blanket.

==Legislative action==
Since the 1920s, Easterseals has worked with federal, state, and local officials to advance legislation for people with disabilities and disability services. This includes the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Passed in 1990, the ADA guarantees the civil rights of people with disabilities and prohibits discrimination.

Easterseals also created a public service campaign that highlighted accessibility and employment issues to be addressed by the ADA&#x27;s implementation.

Today, Easterseals continues to advocate for policies that support people with disabilities.

==Structure==

===Headquarters===
Easterseals&#x27; national office, located in the Board of Trade Building in Chicago, provides assistance to several affiliates through management training, implementation of best practices, consultation services, fundraising, marketing, advocacy, and corporate relations.

===Affiliates and service sites===
Nationwide, Easterseals locations provide services to people with disabilities and special needs in their local communities. Each location operates independently as its own 501(c)(3) corporation under the Easterseals name.

===Board of Directors and House of Delegates===
Easterseals is governed by a National Board of Directors, which is composed of volunteers, most of whom are nominated by one of the organization&#x27;s affiliates across the country. Elections to the Board, composed of between 15 and 19 members, are held annually by another larger volunteer body, Easterseals National House of Delegates. Directors are elected for three-year terms, and terms are staggered to achieve strength and continuity on the board.

Easterseals National House of Delegates consists of volunteers certified by their affiliates to represent them as delegates at the organization&#x27;s annual convention, thus ensuring broad representation of Easterseals affiliates nationwide. In addition to the numerous training and motivational sessions offered to Easterseals board members, delegates and affiliate staff throughout the convention, the Annual Meeting of the House takes place, when the house elects new members to the national board and addresses any other motions put before it.

In March 2020, Easterseals announced the addition of Glenn Henderson, entrepreneur and motivational speaker, and Barry Simon, President and CEO at Easterseals of Oak Hill (CT), to its National Board of Directors.
