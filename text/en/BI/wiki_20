<text>They Live is a 1988 American science fiction action horror film written and directed by John Carpenter, based on the 1963 short story &quot;Eight O&#x27;Clock in the Morning&quot; by Ray Nelson. Starring Roddy Piper, Keith David, and Meg Foster, the film follows a drifter who discovers through special sunglasses that the ruling class are aliens concealing their appearance and manipulating people to consume, breed, and conform to the &quot;status quo&quot; via subliminal messages in mass media.

Having acquired the film rights to the Nelson-penned short story prior to the production of &quot;They Live&quot;, Carpenter used the story as the basis for the screenplay&#x27;s structure, which he wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Frank Armitage&quot;. Carpenter has stated that the themes of &quot;They Live&quot; stemmed from his dissatisfaction with the economic policies of then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan, as well as what Carpenter saw as increasing commercialization in both popular culture and politics.

&quot;They Live&quot; was a minor success upon release, debuting at number 1 at the North American box office. It initially received negative reviews from critics, who lambasted its social commentary, writing, and acting; however, it later gained a cult following and experienced a significantly more favorable critical reception. It is now regarded by many as one of Carpenter&#x27;s best films. The film has also entered the pop culture lexicon, notably having a lasting effect on street art (particularly that of Shepard Fairey).

==Plot==
Nada, a homeless man, comes to Los Angeles, California in pursuit of a job, where he spots a preacher warning that &quot;they&quot; have recruited the rich and powerful to control humanity. He finds employment at a construction site and befriends his coworker Frank, who invites him to live in a shantytown near a church and meets their community leader Gilbert.

A hacker takes over TV broadcasts, alerting that humanity is &quot;their cattle&quot; and the only way to unfold the truth is to shut off the signal at its source. Those watching the broadcast complain of headaches. Nada follows Gilbert and the preacher into the church, discovering a recording of gospel music playing that unbeknownst to Nada obscures a meeting with a group including the hacker. Nada also uncovers equipment and boxes inside, but escapes when he bumps into the preacher. The shantytown and church are destroyed in a police raid, and the hacker and preacher are brutalized by law enforcement officers.

Nada retrieves one of the boxes from the church and takes a pair of sunglasses from it, concealing the box in a trash pile. He finds out they make the world appear monochrome, but also reveal subliminal messages in the media to consume and conform. The most puzzling reveal, however, is they also disclose that many people are actually ghoulish, bug-eyed aliens hiding under human facades. Additionally, the creatures have wristwatch communicators that allow them to teleport, along with surveillance drones. When a group of aliens at a supermarket realize Nada can detect them, he is confronted by two alien police officers. He kills them, steals their guns, and enters a bank, where he sees that multiple employees and customers are aliens. He kills several and escapes by taking a human, Holly Thompson, hostage. Nada attempts to persuade her to put on the glasses, but she throws him out of a window and down a hill.

While Nada retrieves another pair of sunglasses from the trash pile, Frank comes to give Nada his paycheck and orders him to stay away following Nada&#x27;s killing spree becoming widespread news. When Nada tries to put the glasses on him, Frank resists and a lengthy brawl ensues. After subduing him, Nada places the glasses on Frank, who sees the aliens for himself and goes into hiding with Nada. The two run into Gilbert, who introduces them to the human resistance. They are given contact lenses to replace the sunglasses, and learn about the aliens using global warming to make Earth&#x27;s atmosphere similar to their homeworld, while depleting its resources for their own gain. They also learn that the aliens have been bribing human collaborators in exchange for wealth. Holly joins the meeting, bringing information about where the signal may be coming from. She apologizes to Nada for striking him, claiming she hadn&#x27;t known what was occurring. Soon afterwards, the meeting is raided by police, with the majority of those present killed and the survivors scattered. Nada and Frank are cornered in an alley, but Frank activates an alien wristwatch, opening a portal to the alien&#x27;s spaceport on Earth under Cable 54, an alien-run news network.

Coming across a meeting of aliens and collaborators celebrating the defeat of the human resistance, they are approached by a drifter from the shantytown, now a collaborator. Mistaking them for new recruits, he gives the pair a tour of the facility, where the aliens broadcast a signal that prevents humans from identifying them and their hidden messages. Nada and Frank locate Holly and fight their way to the transmitter on the roof, but Holly, herself a collaborator responsible for the raid, murders Frank. Nada kills Holly and destroys the transmitter, but is mortally wounded by a police helicopter. With the signal shut down, Nada gives them the middle finger as he dies.

Meanwhile, humans all over the world discover aliens hiding among them.

==Themes==
Carpenter has said that the film&#x27;s political commentary derives from his dissatisfaction with then–U.S. President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s economic policies—also known as Reaganomics—and what Carpenter viewed as increasing commercialization in both the popular culture and politics of the era.

Upon the film&#x27;s release, Carpenter remarked, &quot;The picture&#x27;s premise is that the &#x27;Reagan Revolution&#x27; is run by aliens from another galaxy. Free enterprisers from outer space have taken over the world, and are exploiting Earth as if it&#x27;s a third world planet. As soon as they exhaust all our resources, they&#x27;ll move on to another world... I began watching TV again. I quickly realized that everything we see is designed to sell us something. ... It&#x27;s all about wanting us to buy something. The only thing they want to do is take our money.&quot; To this end, Carpenter thought of sunglasses as being the tool to seeing the truth, which &quot;is seen in black and white. It&#x27;s as if the aliens have colonized us. That means, of course, that Ted Turner is really a monster from outer space.&quot; The director commented on the alien threat in an interview: &quot;They want to own all our businesses. A Universal executive asked me, &#x27;Where&#x27;s the threat in that? We all sell out every day.&#x27; I ended up using that line in the film.&quot; The aliens were deliberately made to look like ghouls, according to Carpenter, who said &quot;The creatures are corrupting us, so they, themselves, are corruptions of human beings.&quot;

In 2017, in response to neo-Nazi interpretations of the film&#x27;s themes, Carpenter further clarified that the film &quot;is about yuppies and unrestrained capitalism&quot; and &quot;has nothing to do with Jewish control of the world&quot;.

==Production==
===Development===
The idea for &quot;They Live&quot; came from a short story called &quot;Eight O&#x27;Clock in the Morning&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;weebly/91508780&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; by Ray Nelson, originally published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; in November 1963, involving a protagonist, George Nada, and an alien invasion in the tradition of &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;, which Nelson, along with artist Bill Wray, adapted into a story called &quot;Nada&quot; published in the &quot;Alien Encounters&quot; comics anthology in April 1986. John Carpenter describes Nelson&#x27;s story as &quot;... a &quot;D.O.A.&quot;-type of story, in which a man is put in a trance by a stage hypnotist. When he awakens, he realizes that the entire human race has been hypnotized, and that alien creatures are controlling humanity. He has only until eight o&#x27;clock in the morning to solve the problem.&quot; Carpenter acquired the film rights to both the comic book and short story and wrote the screenplay, using Nelson&#x27;s story as a basis for the film&#x27;s structure.

Because the screenplay was the product of so many sources—a short story, a comic book, and input from cast and crew—Carpenter decided to use the pseudonym &quot;Frank Armitage&quot;, an allusion to one of the filmmaker&#x27;s favorite writers, H. P. Lovecraft (Henry Armitage is a character in Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;). Carpenter has always felt a close kinship with Lovecraft&#x27;s worldview, and according to the director &quot;Lovecraft wrote about the hidden world, the &#x27;world underneath&#x27;. His stories were about gods who are repressed, who were once on Earth and are now coming back. The world underneath has a great deal to do with &quot;They Live&quot;.&quot;

===Casting===
For the role of Nada, the filmmaker cast professional wrestler Roddy Piper, whom he had met at WrestleMania III earlier in 1987. For Carpenter, it was an easy choice: &quot;Unlike most Hollywood actors, Roddy has life written all over him.&quot; Carpenter was impressed with Keith David&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Thing&quot; and needed someone &quot;who wouldn&#x27;t be a traditional sidekick but could hold his own.&quot; To this end, Carpenter wrote the role of Frank specifically for David.

===Filming===
&quot;They Live&quot; was shot in eight weeks during March and April 1988, principally on location in downtown Los Angeles, with a budget only slightly greater than $3 million. One of the highlights of the film is a five-and-a-half-minute alley fight between Nada and Frank over a pair of the special sunglasses. Carpenter recalls that the fight took three weeks to rehearse: &quot;It was an incredibly brutal and funny fight, along the lines of the slugfest between John Wayne and Victor McLaglen in &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;.&quot;

==Music==

Music for the film was composed by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth.

==Release==
&quot;They Live&quot; was theatrically released in North America on November 4, 1988, and debuted at #1 at the box office, grossing $4.8 million during its opening weekend. The film spent two weeks in the top ten. The film&#x27;s original release date, advertised in promotional material as October 21, 1988, had been pushed back two weeks to avoid direct competition with &quot;Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers&quot;.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 87% based on 75 reviews, and an average rating of 7.30/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A politically subversive blend of horror and sci fi, &quot;They Live&quot; is an underrated genre film from John Carpenter.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a weighted average rating of 55 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

In his review for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, &quot;Carpenter&#x27;s wit and storytelling craft make this fun and watchable, although the script takes a number of unfortunate shortcuts, and the possibilities inherent in the movie&#x27;s central concept are explored only cursorily.&quot; Jay Carr, writing for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, said &quot;[o]nce Carpenter delivers his throwback-to-the-&#x27;50s visuals, complete with plump little B-movie flying saucers, and makes his point that the rich are fascist fiends, &quot;They Live&quot; starts running low on imagination and inventiveness&quot;, but felt that &quot;as sci-fi horror comedy, &quot;They Live&quot;, with its wake-up call to the world, is in a class with &quot;Terminator&quot; and &quot;RoboCop&quot;, even though its hero doesn&#x27;t sport bionic biceps&quot;.

In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;Since Mr. Carpenter seems to be trying to make a real point here, the flatness of &quot;They Live&quot; is doubly disappointing. So is its crazy inconsistency, since the film stops trying to abide even by its own game plan after a while.&quot; Richard Harrington wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s just John Carpenter as usual, trying to dig deep with a toy shovel. The plot for &quot;They Live&quot; is full of black holes, the acting is wretched, the effects are second-rate. In fact, the whole thing is so preposterous it makes &quot;V&quot; look like &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;.&quot; Rick Groen, in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, wrote, &quot;the movie never gets beyond the pop Orwell premise. The social commentary wipes clean with a dry towelette – it&#x27;s not intrusive and not pedantic, just lighter-than-air.&quot;

The 2012 documentary film &quot;The Pervert&#x27;s Guide to Ideology&quot;, presented by the Slovene philosopher and psychoanalyst Slavoj Žižek, begins with an analysis of &quot;They Live&quot;. Žižek uses the film&#x27;s concept of wearing special sunglasses that reveal truth to explain his definition of ideology. Žižek states:

===Legacy===
&quot;They Live&quot; was ranked #18 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since &#x27;83&quot; list in 2008.

Rotten Tomatoes ranked the fight scene between Roddy Piper&#x27;s character Nada and Keith David&#x27;s character Frank Armitage seventh on their list of &quot;The 20 Greatest Fight Scenes Ever&quot;. The fight scene influenced the 2008 film &quot;The Wrestler&quot;, whose director, Darren Aronofsky, interpreted the scene as a spoof. The fight scene was parodied by the TV show &quot;South Park&quot; in the episode &quot;Cripple Fight&quot;. Shepard Fairey credits the film as a major source of inspiration, sharing a similar logo to his Andre the Giant Has a Posse campaign. &quot;&quot;They Live&quot; was...the basis for my use of the word &#x27;obey&#x27;&quot;, Fairey said. &quot;The movie has a very strong message about the power of commercialism and the way that people are manipulated by advertising&quot;.

Novelist Jonathan Lethem called &quot;They Live&quot; one of his &quot;favorite movies of the eighties, hands down&quot;. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s a great movie...Look at what it does to people, look at how it emboldens and provokes...It&#x27;s disturbing and ridiculous and outrageous and uncomfortable, but I think it&#x27;s the kind of great movie that doesn&#x27;t really need defense, it just needs to be given the air&quot;. Lethem wrote a book-length homage to the movie for the Soft Skull Press &quot;Deep Focus&quot; series.

The 2013 video game &quot;Saints Row IV&quot; features an extended parody of the film with Roddy Piper and Keith David voicing fictionalized versions of themselves in a recreation of the fight scene between Nada and Armitage.

Rock band Green Day paid homage to &quot;They Live&quot; in their music video for &quot;Back in the USA&quot; from the album &quot;Greatest Hits: God&#x27;s Favorite Band&quot;. Similarly, punk band Anti-Flag used the film as inspiration for the music video for their song &quot;The Disease&quot;. David Banner and 9th Wonder also used the film as the influence behind their 2010 video for &quot;Slow Down&quot;.

Minnesota-based alternative hip-hop artist P.O.S. used scenes from the film interspersed with clips of himself for the song &quot;Roddy Piper&quot; from his 2017 album &quot;Chill, Dummy&quot;.

In July 2018, the film was selected to be screened in the Venice Classics section at the 75th Venice International Film Festival.

The film is noted for a popularly quoted line spoken by Nada: &quot;I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass. And I&#x27;m all out of bubblegum&quot;.

The main character Duke Nukem in the video game &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; was made to be a mix of 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s action film stars, including Roddy Piper, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Kurt Russell, and Bruce Campbell. His look was partially based on Nada&#x27;s appearance, sporting similar sunglasses and quoting many lines from the film.

===Home media===
&quot;They Live&quot; was released on VHS by MCA Home Video in 1989. It was later released on DVD by Universal Home Entertainment on October 17, 2000.

On March 2, 2012, the film was released on Blu-ray by StudioCanal. On November 6, 2012, Shout! Factory released a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; of the film on both DVD and Blu-ray.

In 2014, Universal Pictures released &quot;They Live&quot; on DVD along with &quot;The Thing&quot;, &quot;Village of the Damned&quot;, and &quot;Virus&quot; as part of the &quot;4 Movie Midnight Marathon Pack: Aliens&quot;.

On January 19, 2021, Shout! Factory released the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; of the film on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray.

===Awards and honors===
==Future==
In 1996, while promoting &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;, Carpenter revealed that he&#x27;d always wanted to make a sequel to &quot;They Live&quot; as it&#x27;s one of his favorite films, but was never able to get interest or financial backing for the project.

In 2010, a remake movie was stated as being in development with Carpenter in a producing role. In 2011, Matt Reeves signed on to direct and write the screenplay. The project eventually shifted away from being a direct remake of &quot;They Live&quot;, to a re-adaptation of &quot;8 O&#x27;Clock in the Morning&quot; with intents of abandoning the satirical and political elements of the original movie. By October 2023, producer Sandy King stated that a modern audience could see similarities with events of the movie going on in a real-world context, while stating that an expansion from &quot;They Live&quot; would be announced shortly; while acknowledging the possibility of a sequel becoming a reality.

<doc id="342561" wikidata="Q299200" url="?curid=342561" title="Judah Halevi">
<text>Judah haLevi (also Yehuda Halevi or ha-Levi; ; ; c. 1075 – 1141) was a Sephardic Jewish poet, physician and philosopher. He was born in Al-Andalus, either in Toledo or Tudela, in 1075. He is thought to have died in 1141, in either Jerusalem, at that point the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, or in Alexandria, Fatimid Egypt.

Halevi is considered one of the greatest Hebrew poets, celebrated both for his secular and religious poems, many of which appear in present-day liturgy. His most famous philosophical work is the &quot;Kuzari&quot;.

== Biography ==
Judah ben Samuel ha-Levi was born either in Toledo or Tudela, both then under Almoravid rule, between 1075 and 1080. The confusion surrounding his place of birth arises from unclear text in a manuscript. Both cities were under Muslim control when he grew up but were conquered by Christian rulers during his lifetime; Toledo by Alfonso VI in 1086, and Tudela by Alfonso the Battler in 1118. He was educated in traditional Jewish scholarship, in Arabic literature, and in the Greek sciences and philosophy that were available in Arabic. As a youth, he traveled to Granada, the main center of Jewish literary and intellectual life at the time. There he modeled work after Moses Ibn Ezra for a competition, sparking recognition for Halevi&#x27;s aptitude as a poet as well as a close friendship with Ibn Ezra. As an adult he was a physician and an active participant in trade and Jewish communal affairs. He was in contact with both Jewish and non-Jewish nobles and dignitaries within Spain and around the world. For at least part of his life he lived in Toledo and may have practiced medicine for the court there. He and Abraham ibn Ezra were well acquainted and the latter quoted Halevi on multiple occasions in his commentary on Tanakh.

Like other Jewish poets during the &quot;Golden Age of Jewish culture&quot; of the 10th to 12th century, he employed the patterns and themes of Arabic poetry. His themes embrace all those that were current among Hebrew poets: panegyric odes, funeral odes, poems on heartbreak, yearning and the pleasures of life, gnomic epigrams, and riddles. He was also a prolific author of religious verse. His poetry is distinguished by special attention to acoustic effect and wit.

Halevi&#x27;s poems report that he had a daughter and that she had a son, also named Judah. He could well have had other children.

=== Journey to the Holy Land ===

Although he occupied an honored position as a physician, intellectual, and communal leader, Halevi was stirred to attempt a perilous journey to spend his final days in the Land of Israel. In his treatise known as the &quot;Kuzari&quot;, he argues that the presence of the God of Israel is most palpable in the Land of Israel (Kingdom of Jerusalem at the time), and it is therefore ideal and most religiously fulfilling for Jews to live there. He wanted to make his own aliyah: a trip believed to allow spiritual ascension by going &quot;up&quot; to the land. His deep passion for Israel eventually overpowered his hesitation and concerns about leaving his friends, family and status to live under difficult Crusader rule. Additionally, the uncertainties of Jewish communal status and favor within the government during the period of the Reconquista may have caused him to consider the future security of Jews in the Diaspora.

Halevi&#x27;s journey is viewed as either a personal religious pilgrimage or as an urging to the diaspora to abandon their cultural synthesis of Graeco-Arabic-Iberian culture, the former being the Diasporist, the latter a Zionist interpretation.

On September 8, 1140, Halevi arrived in Alexandria, where he was greeted enthusiastically by friends and admirers. He then went to Cairo, where he visited several dignitaries and friends. Returning to Alexandria in the spring, Halevi was reportedly denounced and sued by an apostate who claimed Halevi sought to force him to return to Judaism by withholding money belonging to the him, though he was reportedly acquitted through his connections and through legal subterfuge. Halevi&#x27;s ship set sail from Egypt on May 14, 1141; a letter from Abu Nasr ben Avraham to Halfon ben Netanel dated November 12, 1141 suggests Halevi died in July or August. It is uncertain if he arrived safely in Jerusalem or if his departure was delayed and he died in Egypt, but it can may be reasonably assumed that he was able to reach Palestine in this time. 

Legend also has it that Halevi was trampled by an Arab horseman as he arrived in Jerusalem, with the first account found within a Hebrew miscellany published around 450 years after Halevi&#x27;s presumed death. According to the sixteenth century legend, he died as a martyr while reciting his composition &quot;&quot; in front of the gates of Jerusalem. An 1141 letter to a prominent rabbi in Damascus also potentially refers to Halevi&#x27;s death at the gates of Jerusalem. As only fragments are preserved of this letter, it&#x27;s unclear whether the writer is discussing Halevi or another Jew. Raymond P. Scheindlin notes that &quot;the legend of his martyrdom, combined with the prominence of the Land of Israel in his life and works, invested his image with a mystique that had an important afterlife in Zionist literature.&quot;

Documents that remain from Halevi&#x27;s last years are panegyric to his various hosts in Egypt and explorations of his religious motivations for his aliyah, preserved in the Cairo geniza. Some contain imaginary details of the voyage, such as descriptions of a turbulent sea that express trepidation for the journey but hope for the spiritual light that might follow. Poems and letters bearing on Halevi&#x27;s journey are translated and explicated in Raymond P. Scheindlin, &quot;The Song of the Distant Dove&quot; (Oxford University Press, 2007).

== Poetry ==
Halevi&#x27;s work covers common subjects in Spanish Hebrew poetry using forms and artistic patterns of secular and religious poetry. Some formats include the &quot;zajal&quot;, the &#x27;, and poems utilizing internal rhyme, classical monorhyme patterns and the recently invented strophic patterns. About 800 of his poems are known to us today. The scholar Jose de la Fuente Salvat elevates Halevi to the &quot;most important poet in Judaism of all times&quot;. He composed &#x27; in Hebrew with &quot;kharjas&quot; containing Arabic and Romance.

=== &quot;Diwan&quot; ===
Shortly after his death, his poetry was collected into a &quot;dīwān&quot;, apparently in Egypt and based on smaller collections of his poetry already in circulation. His &quot;diwan&quot; was edited and published by Haim (Henrik) Bródy in four volumes from 1895 to 1904. Bródy&#x27;s edition divides ha-Levi&#x27;s work as follows:

# Poems about friendship and laudatory poems (&quot;shirei yedidut veshirei hakavod&quot;): 138 poems.
# Pieces of correspondence in rhymed prose (&quot;mikhtavim&quot;): 7 pieces.
# Love poems (&quot;shirei ahavah&quot;): 66 poems.
# Elegies (&quot;kol bochim; kinot v&#x27;hespedim&quot;): 43 pieces.
# Elevation of the soul to Zion; traveling poems (&quot;massa nefesh tziyonah&quot;; &quot;shirei tziyon veshirei massa&quot;): 23 poems.
# Riddle poems (&quot;ḥidot&quot;): 49 poems.
# Other poems (&quot;she&#x27;erit Yehudah&quot;; &quot;shirim shonim&quot;): 120 poems.

=== Secular poetry ===
Judah&#x27;s secular or non-religious poetry is composed of poems of friendship, love, humor, and eulogy. Drinking songs by Judah have also been preserved, as well as verses relating to his vocational work as a physician. Halevi&#x27;s prayer for the physician was first translated into English in 1924:

&quot;My God, heal me and I shall be healed.&lt;br&gt;Let not Thine anger be kindled against me so that I be consumed.&lt;br&gt;My medicines are from you, whether good&lt;br&gt;Or evil, whether strong or weak.&lt;br&gt;It is Thou who shalt choose, not I.&lt;br&gt;Of Thy knowledge is the evil and the fair.&lt;br&gt;Not upon my power of healing I rely.&lt;br&gt;Only for Thine healing do I watch.&quot;

==== Friendship ====

Even in Judah&#x27;s youth, a large number of illustrious men gathered around him, like Levi al-Tabban of Zaragoza, the aged poet Judah ben Abun, Judah ibn Ghayyat of Granada, Moses ibn Ezra and his brothers Judah, Joseph, and Isaac, the vizier Abu al-Hasan, Meïr ibn Kamnial, the physician and poet Solomon ben Mu&#x27;allam of Seville, besides his schoolmates Joseph ibn Migas and Baruch Albalia and the grammarian Abraham ibn Ezra.

In Córdoba, Judah addressed a touching farewell poem to Joseph ibn Ẓaddiḳ, the philosopher and poet. In Egypt, celebrated men vied with one another in entertaining him, his reception was a veritable triumph. Here his particular friends were Aaron ben Jeshua Alamani in Alexandria, the nagid Samuel ben Hananiah in Cairo, Halfon ha-Levi in Damietta, and an unknown man in Tyre, probably his last friend. In their sorrow and joy, in the creative spirit and all that moved the souls of these men, Judah sympathetically shared; as he says in the beginning of a short poem: &quot;My heart belongs to you, ye noble souls, who draw me to you with bonds of love&quot;.

==== Elegy ====

Especially tender and plaintive is Judah&#x27;s tone in his elegies. He often utilized the qasida form and meditated on death and fate. Many of them are dedicated to friends such as the brothers Judah (Nos. 19, 20), Isaac (No. 21), and Moses ibn Ezra (No. 16), R. Baruch (Nos. 23, 28), Meïr ibn Migas (No. 27), Isaac Alfasi, head of the yeshiva in Lucena, Cordoba (No. 14), and others. In the case of Solomon ibn Farissol, who was murdered on May 3, 1108, Judah suddenly changed his poem of eulogy (Nos. 11, 22) into one of lamentation (Nos. 12, 13, 93 et seq.).

Child mortality due to plague was high in Judah&#x27;s time and the historical record contains five elegies that mourn the death of a child. Biographer Hillel Halkin hypothesizes that at least one of these honors one of Judah&#x27;s children who did not reach adulthood and who is lost to history.

==== Love ====
Joyous, careless youth, and merry, happy delight in life find their expression in his love-songs, many of which are epithalamia. In Egypt, where the muse of his youth found a glorious &quot;Indian summer&quot; in the circle of his friends, he wrote his &quot;swan-song&quot;: &quot;Wondrous is this land to see, With perfume its meadows laden, But more fair than all to me Is yon slender, gentle maiden. Ah, Time&#x27;s swift flight I fain would stay, Forgetting that my locks are gray.&quot;

Many of his poems are addressed to a gazelle or deer according to the custom in al-Andalus, and his oeuvre includes homoerotic poems such as &quot;That Day While I Had Him&quot; and &quot;&quot;To Ibn Al-Mu&#x27;allim&quot;.&quot; They follow established themes in Arabic and Hebrew poetry such as the yearning of the lover contrasted with the cruelty of the beloved, who possesses a shining countenance. It is unknown whether this work reflects personal experience or artistic tradition.

==== Riddles ====
Judah is noted as the most prolific composer of Hebrew riddles, with a corpus of at least sixty-seven riddles, some of which survive in his own hand, and even in draft form, though only a few have been translated into English. Judah&#x27;s riddles are mostly short, monorhyme compositions on concrete subjects such as everyday objects, animals and plants, or a name or word. One example is the following: &quot;What is it that&#x27;s blind with an eye in its head, but the race of mankind its use can not spare; spends all its life in clothing the dead, but always itself is naked and bare?&quot;

=== Religious poetry ===

==== Shirei Zion (Songs of Zion) ====
Halevi&#x27;s attachment to the Jewish people is a significant theme in his religious poetry; he identifies his sufferings and hopes with that of the broader group. Like the authors of the Psalms, he sinks his own identity in the wider one of the people of Israel, so that it is not always easy to distinguish the personality of the speaker. Though his impassioned call to his contemporaries to return to Zion might have been received with indifference, or even with mockery; his own decision to go to Jerusalem never wavered. &quot;Can we hope for any other refuge either in the East or in the West where we may dwell in safety?&quot; he exclaims to one of his opponents (ib.). His Zionides give voice both to the Jewish people as a whole and to each individual Jew, and he never lost faith in the eventual deliverance and redemption of Israel and his people:

&quot;Lo! Sun and moon, these minister for aye; The laws of day and night cease nevermore: Given for signs to Jacob&#x27;s seed that they Shall ever be a nation — till these be o&#x27;er. If with His left hand He should thrust away, Lo! with His right hand He shall draw them nigh.&quot;

One of his Zionides, &quot;Zion Halo Tishali&quot;, laments the destruction of the temple and puts forth the dream of redemption. It is also one of the most famous kinnot Jews recite on Tisha B&#x27;Av: &quot;Zion, wilt thou not ask if peace&#x27;s wing / Shadows the captives that ensue thy peace / Left lonely from thine ancient shepherding? Lo! west and east and north and south — world-wide / All those from far and near, without surcease / Salute thee: Peace and Peace from every side.&quot;

Halevi&#x27;s poems of longing for Israel like &quot;Libi baMizrach&quot; (my heart is in the east) juxtapose love and pain, and dream and reality to express the distance between Spain and the Middle East and his desire to bridge it. He believed he would find true liberation through subservience to God&#x27;s will in Israel.

Judah was recognized by his contemporaries and in succeeding generations as &quot;the great Jewish national poet.&quot; Some of his poetry and writing has also been considered an early expression of support for Jewish nationalism.

==== Shirei Galut (Songs of the Diaspora) ====
Judah combined descriptions from Scripture with personal and historical Jewish experiences to form another kind of religiously themed poetry. He used devices like sound patterns and vivid imagery to evoke the suffering of exile and fear of the destruction of his people as a result of a delayed redemption.

==== Lyrical poetry ====
Halevi was a prolific author of piyyutim, selichot and kinnot. They were carried to all lands, even as far as India, and they influenced the rituals of the most distant countries. Even the Karaites incorporated some of them into their prayer-book; so that there is scarcely a synagogue in which Judah&#x27;s songs are not sung in the course of the service. The following observation on Judah&#x27;s synagogal poems is made by Zunz:

&quot;As the perfume and beauty of a rose are within it, and do not come from without, so with Judah word and Bible passage, meter and rime, are one with the soul of the poem; as in true works of art, and always in nature, one is never disturbed by anything external, arbitrary, or extraneous.&quot;

His piyyut &quot;Mi Khamokha&quot; (), was translated by Samuel di Castelnuovo and published in Venice in 1609.

Much of his work that expresses his personal relationship with God was later established as liturgical poetry.

Judah also wrote several Shabbat hymns. One ends with the words:

&quot;On Friday doth my cup o&#x27;erflow / What blissful rest the night shall know / When, in thine arms, my toil and woe / Are all forgot, Sabbath my love!

&#x27;Tis dusk, with sudden light, distilled / From one sweet face, the world is filled; / The tumult of my heart is stilled / For thou art come, Sabbath my love!

Bring fruits and wine and sing a gladsome lay, / Cry, &#x27;Come in peace, O restful Seventh day!&#x27;

Judah used complicated Arabic meters in his poems. However, his pupil Solomon Parḥon, who wrote at Salerno in 1160, relates that Judah repented having used the new metrical methods, and had declared he would not again employ them. A later critic, applying a Talmudic witticism to Judah, has said: &quot;It is hard for the dough when the baker himself calls it bad.&quot;

* Heinrich Brody, &quot;Dîwân des Abû-l-Hasan Jehudah ha-Levi/Diwan wĕ-hu &#x27;sefer kolel šire &#x27;abir ha-mešorerim Yĕhudah ben Šĕmu&#x27;el ha-Levi&quot;. 4 vols (Berlin: Itzkowski, 1894-1930): vol. 1, vol. 2 part 2 (notes), pp. 157-330, vol. 3, pp. 1-144, vol. 3, pp. 145-308, vol. 4. According to a 2002 assessment, this is &#x27;a flawed edition marred by numerous textual mistakes and by the erroneous inclusion of poems by other poets. It was also far from including ha-Levi&#x27;s complete oeuvre&#x27;. However, &#x27;even today, nearly a century after Brody&#x27;s effort, there is still no authorized edition of Judah ha-Levi&#x27;s work. The absence of such an edition has been, and will continue to be, an obstacle toward the completion of any credible study of ha-Levi&#x27;s poetry.&#x27;

In 1422, Provencal Jewish scholar Jacob ben Chayyim Comprat Vidal Farissol published a commentary on the &quot;Kuzari&quot; called the &quot;Beit Ya&#x27;akob.&quot;

== Philosophy ==
Halevi studied philosophy as a youth. He admired it but criticized it in a way comparable to al-Ghazali. In the &quot;Kuzari&quot;, he confronts Aristotelian philosophy, Christianity and Islam and expounds his views upon the teachings of Judaism, speaking in favor of accessing God through tradition and devotion rather than philosophical speculation. The work was originally written in Arabic, and entitled &quot;Kitab al-Ḥujjah wal-Dalil fi Nuṣr al-Din al-Dhalil&quot;, كتاب الحجة و الدليل في نصرة الدين الذليل. Judah ibn Tibbon translated it into Hebrew in the mid-12th century with the title &quot;Sefer Hokhahah ve ha Re&#x27;ayah le Hagganat haDat haBezuyah&quot; or &quot;Sefer ha-Kuzari&quot;).

== Burial ==
The traditional tombs of Judah Halevi and Abraham ibn Ezra are located in Cabul, a village in the Galilee.

<doc id="342569" wikidata="Q2315123" url="?curid=342569" title="Kuzari">
<text>The Kuzari, full title Book of Refutation and Proof on Behalf of the Despised Religion (; : &quot;Kitâb al-ḥujja wa&#x27;l-dalîl fi naṣr al-dîn al-dhalîl&quot;), also known as the Book of the Khazar (: &quot;Sefer ha-Kuzari&quot;), is one of the most famous works of the medieval Spanish Jewish philosopher, physician, and poet Judah Halevi, completed in the Hebrew year 4900 (1139-40CE).

Originally written in Arabic, prompted by Halevi&#x27;s contact with a Spanish Karaite, it was then translated by numerous scholars, including Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon, into Hebrew and other languages, and is regarded as one of the most important apologetic works of Jewish philosophy. Divided into five parts (&quot;ma&#x27;amarim&quot; &quot;articles&quot;), it takes the form of a dialogue between a rabbi and the king of the Khazars, who has invited the former to instruct him in the tenets of Judaism in comparison with those of the other two Abrahamic religions: Christianity and Islam.

== Historical foundation ==

The Kuzari takes place during a conversion of some Khazar nobility to Judaism. The historicity of this event is debated. The Khazar Correspondence, along with other historical documents, are said to indicate a conversion of the Khazar nobility to Judaism. A minority of scholars, among them Moshe Gil and Shaul Stampfer have challenged the document&#x27;s claim to represent a real historical event. The scale of conversions within the Khazar Khaganate (if, indeed, any occurred) is unknown.

== Influence of the &quot;Kuzari&quot; ==
The Kuzari&#x27;s emphasis on the uniqueness of the Jewish people, the Torah and the land of Israel bears witness to a radical change of direction in Jewish thinking at that juncture in history, which coincided with the Crusades. Setting aside the possible exception of the work of Maimonides, it had a profound impact on the subsequent development of Judaism, and has remained central to Jewish religious tradition.

Given what has been generally regarded as its pronounced anti-philosophical tendencies, a direct line has been drawn, prominently by Gershom Scholem, between it and the rise of the anti-rationalist Kabbalah movement.

The ideas and style of the work played an important role in debates within the Haskalah or Jewish Enlightenment movement.

== Translations ==
In addition to the 12th-century Hebrew translation by Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon, which passed through eleven printed editions (1st ed. Fano, 1506), another (albeit less successful) Hebrew rendering was made by Judah ben Isaac Cardinal at the beginning of the 13th century. Only portions of latter translation have survived.

In 1887, the text was published in its original Arabic for the first time by Hartwig Hirschfeld; in 1977, an Arabic critical translation was published by David H. Baneth. Parallel to his Arabic edition, Hirschfeld also published a critical edition of the Ibn Tibbon translation of the text that was based upon six medieval manuscripts. In 1885, Hirschfeld published the first German translation, and in 1905 his English translation appeared. In 1972, the first modern translation, by Yehudah Even-Shemuel, into Modern Hebrew from the Arabic original was published. In 1994, a French translation by Charles Touati from the Arabic original was published. In 1997, a Hebrew translation by Rabbi Yosef Qafih from the Arabic original was published, which is now in its fourth edition (published in 2013). A 2009 English translation by Rabbi N. Daniel Korobkin is in print by Feldheim Publishers.

==Contents==
===First essay===
==== Introduction ====
After a short account of the incidents preceding the conversion of the king, and of his conversations with a philosopher, a Christian, and a Muslim concerning their respective beliefs, a Jew appears on the stage, and by his first statement startles the king; for, instead of giving him proofs of the existence of God, he asserts and explains the miracles performed by Him in favor of the Israelites.

The king expresses his astonishment at this exordium, which seems to him incoherent; but the Jew replies that the existence of God, the creation of the world, etc., being taught by religion, do not need any speculative demonstrations. Further, he propounds the principle upon which his religious system is founded; namely, that revealed religion is far superior to natural religion. For the aim of ethical training, which is the object of religion, is not to create in man good intentions, but to cause him to perform good deeds. This aim cannot be attained by philosophy, which is undecided as to the nature of good, but can be secured by religious training, which teaches what is good. As science is the sum of all truth found by successive generations, so religious training is based upon a set of traditions; in other words, history is an important factor in the development of human culture and science.

==== &quot;Creatio ex Nihilo&quot; ====

Halevi writes that as the Jews are the only depositaries of a written history of the development of the human race from the beginning of the world, the superiority of their traditions cannot be denied. Halevi asserts that no comparison is possible between Jewish culture, which in his view is based upon religious truth, and Greek culture, which is based upon science only. He holds that the wisdom of Greek philosophers lacked that divine support with which the Israelite prophets were endowed. Had a trustworthy tradition that the world was created out of nothing been known to Aristotle, he would have supported it by at least as strong arguments as those advanced by him to prove the eternity of matter. Belief in the eternity of matter, however, is not absolutely contrary to Jewish religious ideas; for the Biblical narrative of the Creation refers only to the beginning of the human race, and does not preclude the possibility of preexistent matter.

Still, relying upon tradition, the Jews believe in &quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot; which theory can be sustained by as powerful arguments as those advanced in favor of the belief in the eternity of matter. The objection that the Absolutely Infinite and Perfect could not have produced imperfect and finite beings, made by the Neoplatonists to the theory of &quot;creatio ex nihilo,&quot; is not removed by attributing the existence of all mundane things to the action of nature; for the latter is only a link in the chain of causes having its origin in the First Cause, which is God.

==== Superiority of his faith ====

Halevi now attempts to demonstrate the superiority of his religion, Judaism. The preservation of the Israelites in Egypt and in the wilderness, the delivery to them of the Torah (law) on Mount Sinai, and their later history are to him evident proofs of its superiority. He impresses upon the king the fact that the favor of God can be won only by following God&#x27;s precepts in their totality, and that those precepts are binding only on Jews. The question of why the Jews were favored with God&#x27;s instruction is answered in the Kuzari at I:95: it was based upon their pedigree, i.e., Noah&#x27;s most pious son was Shem. His most pious son was Arpachshad etc. Abraham was Arpachshad&#x27;s descendant, Isaac was Abraham&#x27;s most pious son, and Jacob was Isaac&#x27;s most pious son. The sons of Jacob were all worthy and their children became the Jews. The Jew then shows that the immortality of the soul, resurrection, reward, and punishment are all implied in Scripture and are referred to in Jewish writings.

===Second essay===
==== Question of attributes ====

In the second essay Judah enters into a detailed discussion of some of the theological questions hinted at in the preceding one. To these belongs in the first place that of the divine attributes. Judah rejects entirely the doctrine of essential attributes which had been propounded by Saadia Gaon and Bahya ibn Paquda. For him there is no difference between essential and other attributes. Either the attribute affirms a quality in God, in which case essential attributes cannot be applied to Him more than can any other, because it is impossible to predicate anything of Him, or the attribute expresses only the negation of the contrary quality, and in that case there is no harm in using any kind of attributes. Accordingly, Judah divides all the attributes found in the Bible into three classes: active, relative, and negative, which last class comprises all the essential attributes expressing mere negations.

The question of attributes being closely connected with that of anthropomorphism, Judah enters into a lengthy discussion on this point. Although opposed to the conception of the corporeality of God, as being contrary to Scripture, he would consider it wrong to reject all the sensuous concepts of anthropomorphism, as there is something in these ideas which fills the human soul with the awe of God.

The remainder of the essay comprises dissertations on the following subjects: the excellence of Israel, the land of prophecy, which is to other countries what the Jews are to other nations; the sacrifices; the arrangement of the Tabernacle, which, according to Judah, symbolizes the human body; the prominent spiritual position occupied by Israel, whose relation to other nations is that of the heart to the limbs; the opposition evinced by Judaism toward asceticism, in virtue of the principle that the favor of God is to be won only by carrying out His precepts, and that these precepts do not command man to subdue the inclinations suggested by the faculties of the soul, but to use them in their due place and proportion; the excellence of the Hebrew language, which, although sharing now the fate of the Jews, is to other languages what the Jews are to other nations and what Israel is to other lands.

===Third essay - the oral tradition===
The third essay is devoted to the refutation of the teachings of Karaism and to the history of the development of the oral tradition, the Talmud. Judah ha-Levi shows that there is no means of carrying out the precepts without having recourse to oral tradition; that such tradition has always existed may be inferred from many passages of the Bible, the very reading of which is dependent upon it, since there were no vowels or accents in the original text.

===Fourth essay - Names of God ===

The fourth essay opens with an analysis of the various names of God found in the Bible. According to Judah, all these names, with the exception of the Tetragrammaton, are attributes expressing the various states of God&#x27;s activity in the world. The multiplicity of names no more implies a multiplicity in His essence than do the multifarious influences of the rays of the sun on various bodies imply a multiplicity of suns. To the intuitive vision of the prophet the actions proceeding from God appear under the images of the corresponding human actions. Angels are God&#x27;s messengers, and either they exist for a length of time, or they are created only for special purposes.

From the names of God and the essence of angels Judah passes to his favorite theme and shows that the views of the Prophets are a purer source for a knowledge of God than the teachings of the philosophers. Although he professes great reverence for the &quot;Sefer Yetẓirah,&quot; from which he quotes many passages, he hastens to add that the theories of Abraham elucidated therein had been held by the patriarch before God revealed Himself to him. The essay concludes with examples of the astronomical and medical knowledge of the ancient Hebrews.

=== Fifth essay - Arguments against philosophy ===

The fifth and last essay is devoted to a criticism of the various philosophical systems known at the time of the author. Judah attacks by turns the Aristotelian cosmology, psychology, and metaphysics. To the doctrine of emanation, based, according to him, upon the Aristotelian cosmological principle that no simple being can produce a compound being, he objects in the form of the following query: &quot;Why did the emanation stop at the lunar sphere? Why should each intelligence think only of itself and of that from which it issued and thus give birth to one emanation, thinking not at all of the preceding intelligences, and thereby losing the power to give birth to many emanations?&quot;

He argues against the theory of Aristotle that the soul of man is his thought and that only the soul of the philosopher will be united, after the death of the body, with the active intellect. &quot;Is there,&quot; he asks, &quot;any curriculum of the knowledge one has to acquire to win immortality? How is it that the soul of one man differs from that of another? How can one forget a thing once thought of?&quot; and many other questions of the kind. He shows himself especially severe against the Motekallamin, whose arguments on the creation of the world, on God and His unity, he terms dialectic exercises and mere phrases.

However, Judah ha-Levi is against limiting philosophical speculation to matters concerning creation and God; he follows the Greek philosophers in examining the creation of the material world. Thus he admits that every being is made up of matter and form. The movement of the spheres formed the sphere of the elements, from the fusion of which all beings were created. This fusion, which varied according to climate, gave to matter the potentiality to receive from God a variety of forms, from the mineral, which is the lowest in the scale of creation, to man, who is the highest because of his possessing, in addition to the qualities of the mineral, vegetable, and animal, a hylic intellect which is influenced by the active intellect. This hylic intellect, which forms the rational soul, is a spiritual substance and not an accident, and is therefore imperishable.

The discussion concerning the soul and its faculties leads naturally to the question of free will. Judah upholds the doctrine of free will against the Epicureans and the Fatalists, and endeavors to reconcile it with the belief in God&#x27;s providence and omniscience.

== Commentaries on the book ==

As mentioned above, six commentaries were printed in the fifteenth century, four of them known to us:

* &quot;Edut LeYisrael&quot;- (literally, &quot;witness for Israel&quot;), by Rabbi Shlomo Ben Menachem. (This print is lost).
* &quot;Kol Yehuda&quot;- (literally, &quot;the voice of Judah&quot;), by Rabbi Yehuda Muskato.

And two commentaries of two students of Rabbi Shlomo Ben Menachem: Rabbi Yaakov Ben Parisol and Rabbi Netanel Ben Nechemya Hacaspi. (For more information, see the translation of Yehudah Even-Shemuel, preface, p. 53).

In the 20th century, several more commentaries were written, including:

* &quot;The Kuzari - Commentary&quot;, by Rabbi Shlomo Aviner, four volumes.
* &quot;The Explained Kuzari&quot;, by Rabbi David Cohen, three volumes.

All the above commentaries are in Hebrew.

<doc id="342584" wikidata="Q34004" url="?curid=342584" title="Shona language">
<text>Shona (; ) is a Bantu language of the Shona people of Zimbabwe. The term is variously used to collectively describe all the Central Shonic varieties (comprising Zezuru, Manyika, Korekore and Karanga or Ndau) or specifically Standard Shona, a variety codified in the mid-20th century. Using the broader term, the language is spoken by over 15 million people.

The larger group of historically related languages—called Shona or Shonic languages by linguists—also includes Ndau (Eastern Shona) and Kalanga (Western Shona). In Guthrie&#x27;s classification of Bantu languages, zone S.10 designates the Shonic group.

== Languages that are related to Shona ==
Shona is closely related to Ndau, Kalanga and is related to Tonga, Chewa, Tumbuka, Tsonga and Venda.

Ndau and Kalanga are former dialects of Shona but became independent languages in 2013 because their grammar is very slightly less similar to those of Manyika, Korekore, and Zezuru.

Shona is also similar to Swahili and Tswana.

==Instruction==
Shona is a written standard language with an orthography and grammar that was codified during the early 20th century and fixed in the 1950s. In the 1920s, the Rhodesian administration was faced with the challenge of preparing schoolbooks and other materials in the various languages and dialects and requested the recommendation of South African linguist Clement Doke. The language is now described through monolingual and bilingual dictionaries (chiefly Shona – English).

The first novel in Shona, Solomon Mutswairo&#x27;s &quot;Feso&quot;, was published in 1957. Subsequently, hundreds of novels, short story collections and poetry volumes in Shona have appeared. Shona is taught in the schools, but after the first few grades it is not the general medium of instruction for subjects other than Shona grammar and literature.

==Varieties==

The last systematic study of varieties and sub-varieties of the Central Shona dialect continuum was that done by Clement Doke in 1930, so many sub-varieties are no longer functional and should be treated with caution.

According to information from Ethnologue:

* S14 Karanga (Chikaranga). Spoken in southern Zimbabwe, near Masvingo. It is also mostly spoken in the Midlands province, most notably in Gutu, Masvingo, Mberengwa and Zvishavane districts. Some people refer it as Vhitori.
:Subdialects: Duma, Jena, Mhari (Mari), Ngova, Venda (not the Venda language), Govera.

* S12 Zezuru (Chizezuru, Bazezuru, Bazuzura, Mazizuru, Vazezuru, Wazezuru). Spoken in Mashonaland east and central Zimbabwe, near Harare. The standard language.
:Subdialects: Shawasha, Gova, Mbire, Tsunga, Kachikwakwa, Harava, Nohwe, Njanja, Nobvu, Kwazvimba (Zvimba).

* S11 Korekore (Northern Shona, Goba, Gova, Shangwe). Spoken in northern Zimbabwe, Mvurwi, Bindura, Mt Darwin, Guruve, Chiweshe, Centenary.
:Subdialects: Gova, Tande, Tavara, Nyongwe, Pfunde, Shangwe.

Languages with partial intelligibility with Central Shona, of which the speakers are considered to be ethnically Shona, are the S15 Ndau language, spoken in Mozambique and Zimbabwe, and the S13 Manyika language, spoken in eastern Zimbabwe, near Mutare specifically Chipinge. Ndau literacy material has been introduced into primary schools. 
Maho (2009) recognizes Korekore, Zezuru, Manyika, Karanga, and Ndau as distinct languages within the Shona cluster.

==Phonology==
Shona allows only open syllables. Consonants belong to the next syllable. For example, (&quot;morning&quot;) is syllabified as ; is . Shona is written with a phonemic orthography, with only slightly different pronunciation or grammatical differences according to variety. Shona has two tones, a high and a low tone, but these tones are not indicated in the standard writing system.

=== Vowels ===
Shona has a simple 5-vowels system: . This inventory is quite common cross-linguistically, with similar systems occurring in Greek, Spanish, Tagalog, Swahili and Japanese. Each vowel is pronounced separately even if they fall in succession. For example, ? (&quot;Where do you go?&quot;) is pronounced .

===Consonants===
The consonant sounds of Shona are:

===Whistled sibilants===

Shona and other languages of Southern and Eastern Africa include whistling sounds, (this should not be confused with whistled speech).

Shona&#x27;s whistled sibilants are the fricatives &quot;sv&quot; and &quot;zv&quot; and the affricates &quot;tsv&quot; and &quot;dzv&quot;.
Whistled sibilants stirred interest among the Western public and media in 2006, due to questions about how to pronounce the name of Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai in Zimbabwe. The BBC Pronunciation Unit recommended the pronunciation &quot;chang-girr-ayi&quot; .

===Special characters===

*&#x27; - the apostrophe can be used after the character &quot;n&quot; to create a sound similar to the &quot;-ng&quot; from the English word &quot;ping&quot;. An example word is , which is the word for a traditional healer.

===Old alphabet===
From 1931 to 1955, Unified Shona was written with an alphabet developed by linguist Clement Martyn Doke. This included these letters:

:ɓ (b with hook),
:ɗ (d with hook), 
:ŋ (n with leg),
:ȿ (s with swash tail), 
:ʋ (v with hook), 
:ɀ (z with swash tail).

In 1955, these were replaced by letters or digraphs from the basic Latin alphabet. For example, today is used for and is used for .

==Grammar==
Noun classes ()

Shona nouns are grouped by noun class () based on:

# Meanings () e.g. words found in class 1 and 2 describe a person: (&quot;person&quot;) is in 1 and (&quot;girl&quot;) is in 2.
# Prefix () e.g. words in class 1 have prefix -, class 8 -, class 10 -, class 11 -, etc. Empty prefix units refer to words that do not require a prefix
# Singular and plural forms () e.g. words found in class 8 are plurals of class 7: (&quot;schools&quot;) in class 8 is the plural form of (&quot;school&quot;) in class 7.
# Agreement () e.g. words in class 5 have accordance of the marker -- with pronouns and modifiers: (&quot;this crocodile&quot;), (&quot;this stone&quot;), (&quot;this baboon&quot;); means &#x27;this&#x27;.
== Sample text in Shona ==
Translation

All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

&quot;(Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights)&quot;

<text>E pluribus unum ( , , ) – Latin for &quot;Out of many, one&quot; (also translated as &quot;One out of many&quot;) – is a traditional motto of the United States, appearing on the Great Seal along with &quot;Annuit cœptis&quot; (Latin for &quot;he approves the undertaking&quot;) and &quot;Novus ordo seclorum&quot; (Latin for &quot;New order of the ages&quot;) which appear on the reverse of the Great Seal; its inclusion on the seal was suggested by Pierre Eugene du Simitiere and approved in an act of the Congress of the Confederation in 1782. While its status as national motto was for many years unofficial, &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; was still considered the &quot;de facto&quot; motto of the United States from its early history. Eventually, the U.S. Congress passed an act in 1956 (H. J. Resolution 396), adopting &quot;In God We Trust&quot; as the official motto.

That the phrase &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; has thirteen letters makes its use symbolic of the original Thirteen Colonies which rebelled against the rule of the Kingdom of Great Britain and became the first thirteen states, represented today as the thirteen stripes on the American flag.

The meaning of the phrase originated from the concept that out of the union of the original Thirteen Colonies emerged a new single nation. It is emblazoned across the scroll and clenched in the eagle&#x27;s beak on the Great Seal of the United States.

==Origin==
The 13-letter motto was suggested in 1776 by Pierre Eugene du Simitiere to the committee responsible for developing the seal. At the time of the American Revolution, the phrase appeared regularly on the title page of the London-based &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, founded in 1731, which collected articles from many sources into one periodical. This usage in turn can be traced back to the London-based Huguenot Peter Anthony Motteux, who had employed the adage for his &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Journal, or the Monthly Miscellany&quot; (1692–1694). The phrase is similar to a Latin translation of a variation of Heraclitus&#x27;s tenth fragment, &quot;The one is made up of all things, and all things issue from the one&quot; (&quot;ἐκ πάντων ἓν καὶ ἐξ ἑνὸς πάντα&quot;). A variant of the phrase was used in &quot;Moretum&quot;, a poem belonging to the &quot;Appendix Virgiliana&quot;, describing (on the surface at least) the making of &quot;moretum&quot;, a kind of herb and cheese spread related to modern pesto. In the poem text, &quot;color est e pluribus unus&quot; describes the blending of colors into one. St Augustine used a variant of the phrase, &quot;ex pluribus unum facere&quot; (make one out of many), in his &quot;Confessions&quot;. But it seems more likely that the phrase refers to Cicero&#x27;s paraphrase of Pythagoras in his &quot;De Officiis&quot;, as part of his discussion of basic family and social bonds as the origin of societies and states: &quot;When each person loves the other as much as himself, it makes one out of many (&quot;unum fiat ex pluribus&quot;), as Pythagoras wishes things to be in friendship.&quot;

While &quot;Annuit cœptis&quot; (&quot;He favors our undertakings&quot;) and &quot;Novus ordo seclorum&quot; (&quot;New order of the ages&quot;) appear on the reverse side of the Great Seal, &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; appears on the obverse side of the seal (designed by Charles Thomson), the image of which is used as the national emblem of the United States, and appears on official documents such as passports. It also appears on the seal of the president and in the seals of the vice president of the United States, of the United States Congress, of the United States House of Representatives, of the United States Senate and on the seal of the United States Supreme Court.

==Usage on coins==

The first coins with &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; were dated 1786 and struck under the authorization of New Jersey by Thomas Goadsby and Albion Cox in Rahway, New Jersey. The motto had no New Jersey linkage but was likely an available die that had been created by Walter Mould the previous year for a failed federal coinage proposal. Walter Mould was also authorized by New Jersey to strike state coppers with this motto and did so beginning in early 1787 in Morristown, New Jersey. Lt. Col. Seth Read of Uxbridge, Massachusetts was said to have been instrumental in having &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; placed on U.S. coins. Seth Read and his brother Joseph Read had been authorized by the Massachusetts General Court to mint coppers in 1786. In March 1786, Seth Read petitioned the Massachusetts General Court, both the House and the Senate, for a franchise to mint coins, both copper and silver, and &quot;it was concurred&quot;. &quot;E pluribus unum&quot;, written in capital letters, is included on most U.S. currency, with some exceptions to the letter spacing (such as the reverse of the dime). It is also embossed on the edge of the dollar coin. (&quot;See United States coinage and paper bills in circulation&quot;).

According to the U.S. Treasury, the motto &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; was first used on U.S. coinage in 1795, when the reverse of the half-eagle ($5 gold) coin presented the main features of the Great Seal of the United States. &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; is inscribed on the Great Seal&#x27;s scroll. The motto was added to certain silver coins in 1798, and soon appeared on all of the coins made out of precious metals (gold and silver). In 1834, it was dropped from most of the gold coins to mark the change in the standard fineness of the coins. In 1837, it was dropped from the silver coins, marking the era of the Revised Mint Code. The Coinage Act of 1873 made the inscription a requirement of law upon the coins of the United States. &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; appears on all U.S. coins currently being manufactured, including the Presidential dollars that started being produced in 2007, where it is inscribed on the edge along with &quot;In God We Trust&quot; and the year and mint mark. After the revolution, Rahway, New Jersey became the home of the first national mint to create a coin bearing the inscription &quot;E pluribus unum&quot;.

In a quality control error in early 2007 the Philadelphia Mint issued some one-dollar coins without &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; on the rim; these coins have since become collectibles.

The 2009 and 2010 pennies feature a new design on the back, which displays the phrase &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; in larger letters than in previous years.

==Other usages==

=== U.S. Government ===
*Besides the United States Great Seal&#x27;s obverse and most American coins, the motto appears over the tribune in the United States Senate chamber, on the flags and seals of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the President, the Supreme Court and the Army, and on the state flags of Michigan, New York, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.

=== Sports ===
*The motto appears on the logo of the United States Golf Association.
*The motto is used on the emblem of the Portuguese sports club Sport Lisboa e Benfica since 1904 (initially by one of its predecessors, Sport Lisboa). Similarly to the United States coat of arms, the emblem has a shield and an eagle on top of it serving as a crest and holding a scroll with the motto (although the scroll is beneath the eagle).

=== Arts and media ===
*This motto has also been used in the &quot;Eden&quot; novel of Stanislaw Lem (cited by Doctor).
*&quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; is a march by the composer Fred Jewell, written in 1917 during World War I.

*Bugs Bunny misinterprets the motto at the end of &quot;Roman Legion Hare&quot;: &quot;E Pluribus Uranium&quot;.
*&quot;E unibus pluram&quot; is the title of a 1996 essay by David Foster Wallace which appears in the collection &quot;A Supposedly Fun Thing I&#x27;ll Never Do Again&quot;.
*In 2001, following the September 11 attacks, the Ad Council and Texas ad agency GSD&amp;M launched a public service announcement in which ethnically diverse people say &quot;I am an American&quot;; near the end of the PSA, a black screen shows and the phrase &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; is seen with the English translation underneath.

<doc id="342591" wikidata="Q841182" url="?curid=342591" title="Soyuz 13">
<text>Soyuz 13 (, &quot;Union 13&quot;) was a December, 1973, Soviet crewed space flight, the second test flight of the redesigned Soyuz 7K-T spacecraft that first flew as Soyuz 12. The spacecraft was specially modified to carry the Orion 2 Space Observatory. The flight, crewed by Pyotr Klimuk and Valentin Lebedev, was the Soviet Union&#x27;s first dedicated science mission, and was the first mission controlled by the new Kaliningrad Mission Control Center.

== Crew ==
=== Backup crew ===
=== Reserve crew ===
== Mission parameters ==
*Mass: 
*Perigee: 
*Apogee: 
*Inclination: 51.60°
*Period: 89.20 minutes

== Mission highlights ==
Launched 18 December 1973, the Soyuz 13 crew of Klimuk and Lebedev performed some of the experiments intended for the failed Salyut space stations from the previous year. Unlike Soyuz 12, the craft was equipped with solar panels to allow for an extended mission. Additionally, an orbital module was attached replacing unneeded docking equipment. This module included the Orion 2 Space Observatory (see below).

The crew used a multispectral camera to measure the atmosphere and pollution. They also tested the Oasis 2 closed ecology system, and harvested protein, yielding 30 times the original biomass. Medical tests were also carried out, including experiments to measure blood flow to the brain.

The crew landed in a heavy snowstorm on 26 December 1973, but were recovered a few minutes later, some 200 km at southwest of Karaganda, Kazakhstan.

During its 8-day mission, Soyuz 13 was in orbit around the Earth at the same time as the U.S. Skylab 4 mission, which had been launched on November 16, and which would remain in orbit until February 8, marking the first time that both the United States and the Soviet Union had crewed missions operating simultaneously. 

== Orion 2 Space Observatory ==
The Orion 2 Space Observatory, designed by Grigor Gurzadyan, was operated by crew member Lebedev. Ultraviolet spectrograms of thousands of stars to as faint as 13th magnitude were obtained by a wide-angle meniscus telescope of the Cassegrain system, with an aperture diameter of 240 mm, an equivalent focal length of 1000 mm, and a 4-grade quartz prism objective. The dispersion of the spectrograph was 17, 28 and 55 nm/mm, at wavelengths of 200, 250 and 300 nm respectively. The first satellite Ultraviolet spectrogram of a planetary nebula (IC 2149 in Auriga) was obtained, revealing lines of aluminium and titanium - elements not previously observed in objects of that type. Two-photon emission in that planetary nebula and a remarkable star cluster in Auriga were also discovered. Additionally, comet Kohoutek was observed.

The value at 1 of the &quot;n&quot;th Touchard polynomial is the &quot;n&quot;th Bell number, i.e., the number of partitions of a set of size &quot;n&quot;:
:formula_8

If &quot;X&quot; is a random variable with a Poisson distribution with expected value λ, then its &quot;n&quot;th moment is E(&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;(λ), leading to the definition:
:formula_9

Using this fact one can quickly prove that this polynomial sequence is of binomial type, i.e., it satisfies the sequence of identities:
:formula_10

The Touchard polynomials constitute the only polynomial sequence of binomial type with the coefficient of &quot;x&quot; equal 1 in every polynomial.

The Touchard polynomials satisfy the Rodrigues-like formula:
:formula_11

The Touchard polynomials satisfy the recurrence relation
:formula_12
and
:formula_13
In the case &quot;x&quot; = 1, this reduces to the recurrence formula for the Bell numbers.

A generalization of both this formula and the definition, is a generalization of Spivey&#x27;s formula

formula_14

Using the umbral notation &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)=&quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), these formulas become:
:formula_15
:formula_16

The generating function of the Touchard polynomials is
:formula_17
which corresponds to the generating function of Stirling numbers of the second kind.

Touchard polynomials have contour integral representation:
:formula_18

=== Zeroes ===

All zeroes of the Touchard polynomials are real and negative. This fact was observed by L. H. Harper in 1967. 

The absolute value of the leftmost zero is bounded from above by
:formula_19
although it is conjectured that the leftmost zero grows linearly with the index &quot;n&quot;.

The Mahler measure formula_20 of the Touchard polynomials can be estimated as follows:
:formula_21
where formula_22 and formula_23 are the smallest of the maximum two &quot;k&quot; indices such that
formula_24 and formula_25
are maximal, respectively.

== Generalizations ==
* Complete Bell polynomial formula_26 may be viewed as a multivariate generalization of Touchard polynomial formula_27, since formula_28
* The Touchard polynomials (and thereby the Bell numbers) can be generalized, using the real part of the above integral, to non-integer order:
*:formula_29

<text>The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), one of the Three Forms of Unity, is a Reformed catechism taking the form of a series of questions and answers, for use in teaching Reformed Christian doctrine. It was published in 1563 in Heidelberg, Germany. Its original title translates to Catechism, or Christian Instruction, according to the Usages of the Churches and Schools of the Electoral Palatinate. Commissioned by the prince-elector of the Electoral Palatinate, it is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;Palatinate Catechism.&#x27; It has been translated into many languages and is regarded as one of the most influential of the Reformed catechisms. Today, the Catechism is &#x27;probably the most frequently read Reformed confessional text worldwide.&#x27; 

== History ==
Frederick III, sovereign of the Electoral Palatinate from 1559 to 1576, was the first German prince who professed Reformed doctrine although he was officially Lutheran. The Peace of Augsburg of 1555 originally granted toleration only for Lutherans under Lutheran princes (due to the principle of c&quot;uius regio, eius religio&quot;). Frederick wanted to even out the religious situation of his highly Lutheran realm within the primarily Roman Catholic Holy Roman Empire. He commissioned the composition of a new catechism for his realm, which would serve to both teach the young and settle the differences in doctrine between Lutherans and the Reformed. One of the aims of the catechism was to counteract the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church as well as those of Anabaptists and &#x27;strict&#x27; Gnesio-Lutherans like Tilemann Heshusius (recently elevated to general superintendent of the university) and Matthias Flacius, who were resisting Frederick&#x27;s Reformed influences, particularly on the matter of the Eucharist.

The Catechism based each of its statements on Biblical source texts (although some may call them &#x27;proof-texts&#x27; which can have a negative connotation), but the &#x27;strict&#x27; Lutherans continued to attack it, the assault being still led by Heshusius and Flacius. Frederick himself defended it at the 1566 Diet of Augsburg as based in Scripture rather than based in Reformed theology when he was called to answer to charges, brought by Maximilian II, of violating the Peace of Augsburg. Afterwards, the Catechism quickly became widely accepted.

A synod in Heidelberg approved the catechism in 1563. In the Netherlands, the Catechism was approved by the Synods of Wesel (1568), Emden (1571), Dort (1578), the Hague (1586), as well as the great Synod of Dort of 1618–19, which adopted it as one of the Three Forms of Unity, together with the Belgic Confession and the Canons of Dort. Elders and deacons were required to subscribe and adhere to it, and ministers were required to preach on a section of the Catechism each Sunday so as to increase the often poor theological knowledge of the church members. In many Reformed denominations originating from the Netherlands, this practice is still continued.

== Authorship and influences ==

While the catechism&#x27;s introduction credits the &#x27;entire theological faculty here&#x27; (at the University of Heidelberg) and &#x27;all the superintendents and prominent servants of the church&#x27; for the composition of the Catechism, Zacharius Ursinus (1534–1583) is commonly regarded as the catechism&#x27;s principal author. Caspar Olevianus (1536–1587) was formerly asserted as a co-author of the document, though this theory has been largely discarded by modern scholarship. Johann Sylvan, Adam Neuser, Johannes Willing, Thomas Erastus, Michael Diller, Johannes Brunner, Tilemann Mumius, Petrus Macheropoeus, Johannes Eisenmenger, Immanuel Tremellius and Pierre Boquin are all likely to have contributed to the Catechism in some way. Frederick III himself wrote the preface to the Catechism and closely oversaw its composition and publication.

Ursinus was familiar with the catechisms of Martin Luther, John Calvin, Jan Łaski and Leo Jud and was therefore likely influenced by them, however the Catechism does not betray a patchwork nature but a unity of style. There are three major scholarly traditions identifying the primary theological origin or influences of the Catechism: the first as &#x27;thoroughly Calvinistic&#x27; or associated with the Genevan Reformation, the second as Reformed in the spirit of the Zurich Reformation and Heinrich Bullinger and the third as equally Reformed and Lutheran (especially Melanchthonian). The third tradition is justified by the fact that Frederick III himself was not thoroughly Reformed, but in his life represented a shift from a &#x27;Philippist/Gnesio-Lutheran theological axis to a Philippist-Reformed theological axis&#x27;, which was especially evident in his attraction to the Reformed position on the Eucharist during a formal debate of 1560 between Lutheran and Reformed theologians in Heidelberg, as well as by the fact that the theological faculty which prepared the Catechism consisted of both Reformed and Philippist Lutheran figures. A proponent of this tradition, Lyle D. Bierma, also argues for this by pointing out that the theme of &#x27;comfort&#x27; (evident in the famous first Question), is also present in works of Luther and Melanchthon which were significant in the Reformation of the Palatinate.

== Structure ==
In its current form, the Heidelberg Catechism consists of 52 sections, called &#x27;Lord&#x27;s Days&#x27;, to be taught on each Sunday of the year, and 129 Questions and Answers. After two prefatory Questions (Lord&#x27;s Day 1), the Catechism is divided into three main parts.

=== I. The Misery of Man ===

This part consists of the Lord&#x27;s Day 2, 3, and 4 (Questions 3-11), discussing the following doctrines.
* The knowledge of sin to God&#x27;s Law, with Christ&#x27;s summary of the Law in the two great commandments.
* Man&#x27;s creation after God&#x27;s image &#x27;in righteousness and true holiness; that he might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love Him and live with Him in eternal blessedness, to praise and glorify Him&#x27;.
* The Fall of Adam, leading to the present condition of man which provokes God&#x27;s wrath.

=== II. Of Man&#x27;s Redemption ===

This part consists of Lord&#x27;s Day 5 through to Lord&#x27;s Day 31 (Questions 12-85), discussing the following doctrines.
* Satisfaction theory of atonement or penal substitutionary atonement, the necessity of redemption through Christ, and its foreshadowing in the Old Testament.
* The appropriation of the effects of the Atonement by faith, which is &#x27;not only a certain knowledge whereby I hold for truth all that God has revealed to us in His Word, but also a hearty trust which the Holy Ghost works in me by the Gospel that not only to others, but to me also, forgiveness of sins, everlasting righteousness and salvation are freely given by God, merely of grace, only for the sake of Christ&#x27;s merits&#x27;.
* The importance of the content of faith which is explained by an exposition of 12 articles of the Christian faith, known as the Apostles&#x27; Creed. The discussion of these articles is further divided into sections on the Trinity as revealed by God&#x27;s Word.
** God the Father and our creation (Lord&#x27;s Days 9-10).
** God the Son and our redemption (Lord&#x27;s Days 11-19).
** God the Holy Spirit and our sanctification (Lord&#x27;s Days 20-22).
* Divine providence.
* The name of Christ and the term &#x27;Christian&#x27;.
* The Ascension of Christ and its benefits.
* The Church and the communion of saints.
* Justification
* The Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper.
* The office of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.
* The preaching of the Gospel and Church Discipline.

=== III. Of Thankfulness ===

This part consists of the Lord&#x27;s Day 32 through to Lord&#x27;s Day 52 (Questions 86-129). It discusses:
* Conversion (Lord&#x27;s Days 32–33)
* Christian duty as the fruits of repentance and faith, to the glory of God and the help of our neighbours, according to the Ten Commandments (Lord&#x27;s Days 34–44), which are expounded upon in positive and negative terms.
* Obedience to God&#x27;s will and the necessity of prayer, with and exposition of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer (Lord&#x27;s Days 45–52).

== Lord&#x27;s Day 1 ==
The first Lord&#x27;s Day should be read as a summary of the catechism as a whole. As such, it illustrates the character of this work, which is devotional as well as dogmatic or doctrinal. The celebrated first Question and Answer read thus.What is thine only comfort in life and in death?
That I, with body and soul, both in life and in death, am not my own, but belong to my faithful Saviour Jesus Christ, who with His precious blood has fully satisfied for all my sins, and redeemed me from all the power of the devil; and so preserves me that without the will of my Father in heaven not a hair can fall from my head; yea, and that all things must work together for my salvation. Wherefore by His Holy Spirit He also assures me of eternal life, and makes me heartily willing and ready henceforth to live unto Him.Bierma argues that the opening lines of this answer are remarkably similar to Luther&#x27;s explanation of the second article of the Apostles&#x27; Creed in his &quot;Small Catechism&quot; (1529), &#x27;that I may belong to him [...] [Jesus Christ] has set me free [...] He has purchased and freed me from all sins [...] from the tyranny of the devil [...] with his [...] precious blood&#x27;. However, the end of the Answer appears to originate in a north German Reformed catechism which was a translation by Marten Micron of a work by Jan Łaski, which states that &#x27;the Holy Spirit assures me that I am a member of Christ&#x27;s church in two ways: by testifying to my spirit that I am a child of God, and by moving me to obey the commandments&#x27;.

== Lord&#x27;s Day 30 ==
The Catechism is most notoriously and explicitly anti-Roman Catholic in the additions made in its second and third editions to Lord&#x27;s Day 30 concerning &#x27;the popish mass&#x27;, which is condemned as an &#x27;accursed idolatry&#x27;.

Following the late 17th-century War of Palatine Succession, Heidelberg and the Palatinate were again in an unstable political situation with sectarian battle lines. In 1719, an edition of the Catechism was published in the Palatinate that included Lord&#x27;s Day 30. The Roman Catholic reaction was so strong, that the Catechism was banned by Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine. This provoked a reaction from Reformed countries, leading to a reversal of the ban.

In some Reformed denominations Question and Answer 80, the first of Lord&#x27;s Day 30, have been removed or bracketed but noted as part of the original Catechism.

== Significance ==

According to W. A. Curtis in his &quot;History of Creeds and Confessions of Faith&quot;, &#x27;No praise is too great for the simplicity of language, the accord with Scripture, the natural order, the theological restraint and devout tone which characterize this Catechism&#x27;.

The influence of the Catechism extended to the Westminster Assembly of Divines who, in part, used it as the basis for their Shorter Catechism. In 1870, it was authorised for use in the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. The Catechism is one of the three Reformed confessions that form the doctrinal basis of the original Reformed Church in The Netherlands, and is recognized as such also by the Dutch Reformed churches that originated from that church during and since the 19th century. 

Several Protestant denominations in North America presently honour the Catechism officially: the Presbyterian Church in America, ECO (A Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians), the Christian Reformed Church, the United Reformed Churches, the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Reformed Church in America, the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, the United Church of Christ (a successor to the German Reformed churches), the Reformed Church in the United States (also of German Reformed heritage),the Evangelical Association of Reformed and Congregational Christian Churches, the Free Reformed Churches of North America, the Heritage Reformed Congregations, the Canadian and American Reformed Churches, Protestant Reformed Churches, the Reformed Protestant Churches and several other Calvinist churches of Dutch origin around the world. Likewise, the Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church lists it as an influence on United Methodism.

A revision of the catechism was prepared by the Baptist minister, Hercules Collins. Published in 1680, under the title &#x27;An Orthodox Catechism&#x27;, it was identical in content to the Heidelberg catechism, with exception to questions regarding baptism, where adult immersion was defended against infant baptism and the other modes of affusion and aspersion.

<text>The Lower East Side, sometimes abbreviated as LES, is a historic neighborhood in the southeastern part of Manhattan in New York City. It is located roughly between the Bowery and the East River from Canal to Houston streets. Historically, it was understood to encompass a much larger area, from Broadway to the East River and from East 14th Street to Fulton and Franklin Streets.

Traditionally an immigrant, working class neighborhood, it began rapid gentrification in the mid-2000s, prompting the National Trust for Historic Preservation to place the neighborhood on their list of America&#x27;s Most Endangered Places in 2008.

The Lower East Side is part of Manhattan Community District 3, and its primary ZIP Code is 10002. It is patrolled by the 7th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==Boundaries==

The Lower East Side is roughly bounded by East 14th Street on the north, by the East River to the east, by Fulton and Franklin Streets to the south, and by Pearl Street and Broadway to the west. This more extensive definition of the neighborhood includes Chinatown, the East Village, and Little Italy. A less extensive definition would have the neighborhood bordered in the south and west by Chinatown, – which extends north to roughly Grand Street – in the west by Nolita and in the north by the East Village.

Historically, the &quot;Lower East Side&quot; referred to the area alongside the East River from about the Manhattan Bridge and Canal Street up to 14th Street, and roughly bounded on the west by Broadway. It included areas known today as East Village, Alphabet City, Chinatown, Bowery, Little Italy, and NoLIta. Parts of the East Village are still known as &quot;Loisaida&quot;, a Latino pronunciation of &quot;Lower East Side&quot;.

===Political representation===
Politically, the neighborhood is in New York&#x27;s 7th and 12th congressional districts. It is in the New York State Assembly&#x27;s 65th district and 74th district; the New York State Senate&#x27;s 26th district; and New York City Council&#x27;s 1st and 2nd districts.

==History==
===Prior to Europeans===
As was true of all of Manhattan Island, the area now known as the Lower East Side was occupied by members of the Lenape tribe, who were organized in bands that moved from place to place according to the seasons, fishing on the rivers in the summer, and moving inland in the fall and winter to gather crops and hunt for food. Their main trail took approximately the route of Broadway. One encampment in the Lower East Side area, near Corlears Hook was called Rechtauck or Naghtogack.

===Early settlement===
The population of the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam was located primarily below the current Fulton Street, while north of it were a number of small plantations and large farms called &quot;bouwerij&quot; (&quot;bowery&quot;, equivalent to &quot;boerderij&quot; in present-day Dutch). Around these farms were a number of enclaves of free or &quot;half-free&quot; Africans, which served as a buffer between the Dutch and the Native Americans. One of the largest of these was located along the modern Bowery between Prince Street and Astor Place, as well as the &quot;only separate enclave&quot; of this type within Manhattan. These black farmers were some of the earliest settlers of the area.

Gradually, during the 17th century, there was an overall consolidation of the boweries and farms into larger parcels, and much of the Lower East Side was then part of the Delancey farm.

James Delancey&#x27;s pre-Revolutionary farm east of post road leading from the city (Bowery) survives in the names Delancey Street and Orchard Street. On the modern map of Manhattan, the Delancey farm is represented in the grid of streets from Division Street north to Houston Street. In response to the pressures of a growing city, Delancey began to survey streets in the southern part of the &quot;West Farm&quot; in the 1760s. A spacious projected &quot;Delancey Square&quot;—intended to cover the area within today&#x27;s Eldridge, Essex, Hester and Broome Streets—was eliminated when the loyalist Delancey family&#x27;s property was confiscated after the American Revolution. The city Commissioners of Forfeiture eliminated the aristocratic planned square for a grid, effacing Delancey&#x27;s vision of a New York laid out like the West End of London.

===Corlears Hook===
The point of land on the East River now called Corlears Hook was also called Corlaers Hook under Dutch and British rule and briefly Crown Point during British occupation in the Revolution. It was named after the schoolmaster Jacobus van Corlaer, who settled on this &quot;plantation&quot; that in 1638 was called by a Europeanized version of its Lenape name, &quot;Nechtans&quot; or &quot;Nechtanc&quot;. Corlaer sold the plantation to Wilhelmus Hendrickse Beekman (1623–1707), founder of the Beekman family of New York; his son Gerardus Beekman was christened at the plantation on August 17, 1653.

On February 25, 1643, as part of Kieft&#x27;s War, volunteers from the New Amsterdam colony killed forty Wiechquaesgecks at their encampment in the Massacre at Corlears Hook, in retaliation for ongoing conflicts between the colonists and the natives of the area, including the natives&#x27; unwillingness to pay tribute and their refusal to turn over the accused killer of a colonist.

The projection into the East River that retained Corlaer&#x27;s name was an important landmark for navigators for 300 years. On older maps and documents, it is usually spelled &quot;Corlaers&quot; Hook, but since the early 19th century, the spelling has been anglicized to &quot;Corlears&quot;. The rough unplanned settlement that developed at Corlaer&#x27;s Hook under the British occupation of New York during the Revolution was separated from the densely populated city by rugged hills of glacial till: &quot;this region lay beyond the city proper, from which it was separated by high, uncultivated, and rough hills&quot;, observers recalled in 1843.

As early as 1816, Corlears Hook was notorious for streetwalkers, &quot;a resort for the lewd and abandoned of both sexes&quot;, and in 1821 its &quot;streets abounding every night with preconcerted groups of thieves and prostitutes&quot; were noted by &quot;The Christian Herald&quot;. In the course of the 19th century, they came to be called &quot;hookers&quot;. In the 1832 summer of New York City&#x27;s cholera epidemic, a two-story wooden workshop in the neighborhood was commandeered to serve as a makeshift cholera hospital; between July 18 and September 15, when the hospital was closed as the epidemic wound down, 281 patients were admitted, both black and white, of whom 93 died.

In 1833, Corlear&#x27;s Hook was the location of some of the first tenements built in New York City.

Corlears Hook is mentioned on the first page of Chapter 1 of Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, first published in 1851: &quot;Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see? ...&quot; and again in Chapter 99—The Doubloon.

The original location of Corlears Hook is now obscured by shoreline landfill. It was near the east end of the present pedestrian bridge over the FDR Drive near Cherry Street. The name is preserved in Corlears Hook Park at the intersection of Jackson and Cherry Streets along the East River Drive.

===Immigration===
The bulk of immigrants who came to New York City in the late 19th and early 20th centuries came to the Lower East Side, moving into crowded tenements there. By the 1840s, large numbers of German immigrants settled in the area, and a large part of it became known as &quot;Little Germany&quot; or &quot;Kleindeutschland&quot;. This was followed by groups of Italians and Eastern European Jews, as well as Greeks, Hungarians, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Slovaks and Ukrainians, each of whom settled in relatively homogeneous enclaves. By 1920, the Jewish neighborhood was one of the largest of these ethnic groupings, with 400,000 people, pushcart vendors and storefronts prominent on Orchard and Grand Streets, and numerous Yiddish theatres along Second Avenue between Houston and 14th Streets.

Living conditions in these &quot;slum&quot; areas were far from ideal, although some improvement came from a change in the zoning laws, which required &quot;new law&quot; tenements to be built with air shafts between them so that fresh air and some light could reach each apartment. Still, reform movements, such as the one started by Jacob Riis&#x27;s book &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot; continued to attempt to alleviate the problems of the area through settlement houses, such as the Henry Street Settlement, and other welfare and service agencies. The city itself moved to address the problem when it built First Houses, the first such public housing project in the United States, in 1935–1936. The development, located on the south side of East 3rd Street between First Avenue and Avenue A, and on the west side of Avenue A between East 2nd and East 3rd Streets, is now considered to be located within the East Village.

===20th century===

By the turn of the twentieth century, the neighborhood had become closely associated with radical politics, such as anarchism, socialism, and communism. It was also known as a place where many popular performers had grown up, such as Eddie Cantor, Al Jolson, George and Ira Gershwin, Jimmy Durante, and Irving Berlin. Later, more radical artists such as the Beat poets and writers were drawn to the neighborhood – especially the parts which later became the East Village – by the inexpensive housing and cheap food.

The German population decreased in the early twentieth century as a result of the &quot;General Slocum&quot; disaster and due to anti-German sentiment prompted by World War I. After World War II, the Lower East Side became New York City&#x27;s first racially integrated neighborhood with the influx of African Americans and Puerto Ricans. Areas where Spanish speaking was predominant began to be called Loisaida.

By the 1960s, the influence of the Jewish and Eastern European groups declined as many of these residents had left the area, while other ethnic groups had coalesced into separate neighborhoods, such as Little Italy. The Lower East Side then experienced a period of &quot;persistent poverty, crime, drugs, and abandoned housing&quot;. A substantial portion of the neighborhood was slated for demolition under the Cooper Square Urban Renewal Plan of 1956, which was to redevelop the area from Ninth to Delancey Streets from the Bowery/Third Avenue to Chrystie Street/Second Avenue with new privately owned cooperative housing. The United Housing Foundation was selected as the sponsor for the project, which faced great opposition from the community. Neither the original large-scale development nor a 1961 revised proposal was implemented, and it was not until 1991 that an agreement was made to redevelop a small portion of the proposed renewal site.

===East Village split and gentrification===
The East Village was once considered the Lower East Side&#x27;s northwest corner. However, in the 1960s, the demographics of the area above Houston Street began to change as hipsters, musicians, and artists moved in. Newcomers and real estate brokers popularized the East Village name, and the term was adopted by the popular media by the mid-1960s. As the East Village developed a culture separate from the rest of the Lower East Side, the two areas came to be seen as two separate neighborhoods rather than the former being part of the latter.

By the 1980s, the Lower East Side had begun to stabilize after its period of decline, and once again began to attract students, artists, and adventurous members of the middle-class, as well as immigrants from countries such as Taiwan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, China, the Dominican Republic, India, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and Poland.

In the early 2000s, the gentrification of the East Village spread to the Lower East Side proper, making it one of the trendiest neighborhoods in Manhattan. Orchard Street, despite its &quot;Bargain District&quot; moniker, is now lined with upscale boutiques. Similarly, trendy restaurants, including Clinton St. Baking Company &amp; Restaurant, are found on a stretch of tree-lined Clinton Street that &quot;New York Magazine&quot; described as the &quot;hippest restaurant row&quot; on the Lower East Side.

In November 2007, the Blue Condominium, a 32-unit, 16-story luxury condominium tower, was completed at 105 Norfolk Street just north of Delancey Street. The pixellated, faceted blue design starkly contrasts with the surrounding neighborhood. Following the construction of the Hotel on Rivington one block away, several luxury condominiums around Houston, and the New Museum on Bowery, this new wave of construction is another sign that the gentrification cycle is entering a high-luxury phase similar to in SoHo and Nolita in the previous decade.

More recently, the gentrification that was previously confined to the north of Delancey Street continued south. Several restaurants, bars, and galleries opened below Delancey Street after 2005, especially around the intersection of Broome and Orchard Streets. The neighborhood&#x27;s second boutique hotel, Blue Moon Hotel, opened on Orchard Street just south of Delancey Street in early 2006. However, unlike The Hotel on Rivington, the Blue Moon used an existing tenement building, and its exterior is almost identical to neighboring buildings. In September 2013, it was announced that the Essex Crossing redevelopment project was to be built in the area, centered around the intersection of Essex and Delancey Streets, but mostly utilizing land south of Delancey Street.

== Demographics ==
The census tabulation area for the Lower East Side is bounded to the north by Houston Street and to the west by the Bowery, Essex Street, and Montgomery Street. According to the 2020 United States Census, the population of Lower East Side was 49,149, an increase of 1,725 (3.6%) from the 47,424 counted in 2010. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 28.6% (13,578) White, 9.2% (3,890) African American, 25.0% (13,009) Asian, 1.0% (467) from other races, and 3.1% (1,500) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 33.6% (15,930) of the population.

The racial composition of the Lower East Side changed moderately from 2000 to 2010, with the most significant changes being the White population&#x27;s increase by 18% (2,514), the Asian population&#x27;s increase by 10% (1,673), and the Hispanic / Latino population&#x27;s decrease by 10% (3,219). The minority Black population experienced a slight increase by 1% (41), while the very small population of all other races decreased by 17% (310).

The Lower East Side lies in Manhattan Community District 3, which encompasses the Lower East Side, the East Village and Chinatown. Community District 3 had 171,103 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 82.2 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are adults: a plurality (35%) are between the ages of 25–44, while 25% are between 45–64, and 16% are 65 or older. The ratio of youth and college-aged residents was lower, at 13% and 11%, respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 3 was $39,584, though the median income in the Lower East Side individually was $51,649. In 2018, an estimated 18% of Community District 3 residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twelve residents (8%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 48% in Community District 3, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51%, respectively. Based on this calculation, , Community District 3 was considered to be gentrifying: according to the Community Health Profile, the district was low-income in 1990 and has seen above-median rent growth up to 2010.

==Culture==

===Immigrant neighborhood===
One of the oldest neighborhoods of the city, the Lower East Side has long been a lower-class worker neighborhood and often a poor and ethnically diverse section of New York. As well as Irish, Italians, Poles, Ukrainians, Romanians and other ethnic groups, it once had a sizeable German population and was known as Little Germany (Kleindeutschland). Today it is a predominantly Puerto Rican and Dominican community, and in the process of gentrification (as documented by the portraits of its residents in the Clinton+Rivington chapter of The Corners Project.)

Since the immigration waves from Eastern Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century, the Lower East Side became known as having been a center of Jewish immigrant culture. In her 2000 book &quot;Lower East Side Memories: A Jewish Place in America&quot;, Hasia Diner explains that the Lower East Side is especially remembered as a place of Jewish beginnings for Ashkenazi American Jewish culture. Vestiges of the area&#x27;s Jewish heritage exist in shops on Hester and Essex Streets, and on Grand Street near Allen Street. An Orthodox Jewish community is based in the area, operating yeshiva day schools and a mikvah. A few Judaica shops can be found along Essex Street, as are a few Jewish scribes and variety stores. Some kosher delis and bakeries, as well as a few &quot;kosher style&quot; delis, including the famous Katz&#x27;s Deli, are located in the neighborhood. Second Avenue in the Lower East Side was home to many Yiddish theatre productions in the Yiddish Theater District during the early part of the 20th century, and Second Avenue came to be known as “Yiddish Broadway”, even though most of the theaters are now gone. Songwriter Irving Berlin, actor John Garfield, and singer Eddie Cantor grew up here.

Since the mid-20th century, the area has been settled primarily by immigrants, primarily from Latin America, especially Central America and Puerto Rico. They have established their own groceries and shops, marketing goods from their culture and cuisine. Bodegas have replaced Jewish shops, and there are mostly Roman Catholics.

In what is now the East Village, earlier populations of Poles and Ukrainians have moved on and been largely supplanted by newer immigrants. The immigration of numerous Japanese people over the last fifteen years or so has led to the proliferation of Japanese restaurants and specialty food markets. There is also a notable population of Bangladeshis and other immigrants from Muslim countries, many of whom are congregants of the small Madina Masjid, a mosque on First Avenue and 11th Street.

The neighborhood still has many historic synagogues, such as the Bialystoker Synagogue, Beth Hamedrash Hagadol, the Eldridge Street Synagogue, Kehila Kedosha Janina (the only Greek synagogue in the Western Hemisphere), the Angel Orensanz Center (the fourth oldest synagogue building in the United States), and various smaller synagogues along East Broadway. Another landmark, the First Roumanian-American congregation (the Rivington Street Synagogue), partially collapsed in 2006 and was subsequently demolished. In addition, there is a major Hare Krishna temple and several Buddhist houses of worship.

Chinese residents have also been moving into Lower East Side, and since the late 20th century, they have comprised a large immigrant group in the area. The part of the neighborhood south of Delancey Street and west of Allen Street has, in large measure, become part of Chinatown. Grand Street is one of the major business and shopping streets of Chinatown. Also contained within the neighborhood are strips of lighting and restaurant supply shops on the Bowery.

====Jewish neighborhood====

While the Lower East Side has been a place of successive immigrant populations, many American Jews relate to the neighborhood in a strong manner, and Chinatown holds a special place in the imagination of Chinese Americans, just as Astoria in Queens holds a place in the hearts of Greek Americans. It was a hub for ancestors of many people in the metropolitan area, and much depicted in fiction and films.

Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem, established in 1907, was long led by Moshe Feinstein.

In the late 20th century, Jewish communities have worked to preserve a number of buildings historically associated with the Jewish immigrant community. Notable sites include:
* The Educational Alliance Settlement house – 175 East Broadway
* Henry Street Settlement – 263–267 Henry Street and 466 Grand Street
* University Settlement House – 184 Eldridge Street
* Katz&#x27;s Deli – 205 East Houston Street
* Guss&#x27; Pickles – 87 Orchard Street
* Kossar&#x27;s Bialys – 367 Grand Street
* Gertel&#x27;s Bake Shop – formerly at 53 Hester Street from 1914 until it closed in 2007
* Knickerbocker Village – 10 Monroe Street
* Streit&#x27;s Matzo Co. – 150 Rivington Street
* Yonah Schimmel&#x27;s Knish Bakery – 137 East Houston Street
* Mendel Goldberg Fabrics, since 1890 – 72 Hester Street
* Harris Levy Fine Linens, since 1894 – 98 Forsyth Street
* Russ &amp; Daughters – 179 East Houston Street
* Schapiro&#x27;s Kosher Wine – Essex Street Market
* Forward Building – 173-175 East Broadway
* Jarmulowsky Bank Building – 54-58 Canal Street, 5-9 Orchard Street

Synagogues include:
* Adath Jeshurun of Jassy Synagogue – 58-60 Rivington Street
* Bialystoker Synagogue – 7–11 Willet Street, originally built in the Greek Revival style for the Willett Street Methodist Episcopal Church in 1826, and acquired in 1905 for the Orthodox Jewish congregation.
* Beth Hamedrash Hagadol – 60–64 Norfolk Street
* Eldridge Street Synagogue – 12 Eldridge Street
* Kehila Kedosha Janina – 280 Broome Street
* Angel Orensanz Center – the fourth-oldest synagogue building in the United States
* Congregation Chasam Sopher – 10 Clinton Street
* Congregation Chevra Kadisha Anshe Sochaczew – 121 Ludlow Street
* Meseritz Synagogue – 415 East 6th Street
* Podhajcer Shul – 108 East First Street
* Stanton Street Synagogue – 180 Stanton Street
* Boyaner &quot;kloiz&quot; at 247 East Broadway, opened in 1928 by the Boyaner Rebbe of New York

====Little Fuzhou, Chinatown====

Little Fuzhou (), or Fuzhou Town () is a neighborhood within the eastern sliver of Chinatown, in the Two Bridges and Lower East Side areas of Manhattan. Starting in the 1980s and by the 1990s, the neighborhood became a prime destination for immigrants from Fuzhou, Fujian, China. Manhattan&#x27;s Little Fuzhou is centered on East Broadway. However, since the 2000s, Chinatown, Brooklyn became New York City&#x27;s new primary destination for Fuzhou immigrants, resulting in a second Little Fuzhou that has far surpassed the original as the Fuzhou cultural center of the New York metropolitan area, and is still rapidly growing in contrast to Manhattan&#x27;s Little Fuzhou that is shrinking under gentrification.

Since the 2010s, the Fuzhou immigrant population and businesses have been declining throughout the whole eastern portion of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown due to gentrification. There is a rapidly increasing influx of high-income, often non-Chinese, professionals moving into this area, including high-end hipster-owned businesses.

===Art===

The neighborhood has become home to numerous contemporary art galleries. One of the first was ABC No Rio. Begun by a group of Colab no wave artists (some living on Ludlow Street), ABC No Rio opened an outsider gallery space that invited community participation and encouraged the widespread production of art. Taking an activist approach to art that grew out of The Real Estate Show (the take over of an abandoned building by artists to open an outsider gallery only to have it chained closed by the police) ABC No Rio kept its sense of activism, community, and outsiderness. The product of this open, expansive approach to art was a space for creating new works that did not have links to the art market place and that were able to explore new artistic possibilities.

Other outsider galleries sprung up throughout the Lower East Side and East Village—some 200 at the height of the scene in the 1980s, including the 124 Ridge Street Gallery among others. In December 2007, the New Museum relocated to a brand-new, critically acclaimed building on Bowery at Prince. A growing number of galleries are opening in the Bowery neighborhood to be in close proximity to the museum. The Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space, which opened in 2012, exhibits photography featuring the neighborhood in addition to chronicling its history of activism.

Social service agencies like Henry Street Settlement and Educational Alliance have visual and performing arts programs, the former at Abrons Arts Center, a home for contemporary interdisciplinary arts.

The neighborhood is also home to several graffiti artists, such as Chico and Jean-Michel Basquiat.

===Nightlife and live music===
As the neighborhood has gentrified and become safer at night, it has transformed into a popular late-night destination. Orchard, Ludlow and Essex between Rivington Street and Stanton Street have become especially packed at night, and the resulting noise is a cause of tension between bar owners and longtime residents. Furthermore, as gentrification continues, many established landmarks and venues have been lost.

The Lower East Side is also home to many live music venues. Punk bands played at C-Squat and alternative rock bands play at Bowery Ballroom on Delancey Street and Mercury Lounge on East Houston Street. Punk bands play at Otto&#x27;s Shrunken Head and R-Bar. Punk and alternative bands play at Bowery Electric just north of the old CBGB&#x27;s location. There are also bars that offer performance space, such as Pianos on Ludlow Street and Arlene&#x27;s Grocery on Stanton Street.

The Lower East Side is the location of the Slipper Room, a burlesque, variety and vaudeville theatre on Orchard and Stanton. Lady Gaga, Leonard Cohen and U2 have all appeared there, while popular downtown performers—including Dirty Martini, Murray Hill, and Matt Fraser—often appear. Variety shows are regularly hosted by comedians James Habacker, Bradford Scobie, Matthew Holtzclaw, and Matt Roper, under the guise of various characters.

==Police and crime==

The Lower East Side is patrolled by the 7th Precinct of the NYPD, located at Pitt Street. The 7th Precinct, along with the neighboring 5th Precinct, ranked 48th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. , with a non-fatal assault rate of 42 per 100,000 people, the Lower East Side and East Village&#x27;s rate of violent crimes per capita is less than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 449 per 100,000 people is higher than that of the city as a whole.

The 7th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 64.8% between 1990 and 2019. The precinct reported 0 murders, 7 rapes, 149 robberies, 187 felony assaults, 94 burglaries, 507 grand larcenies, and 18 grand larcenies auto in 2019.

==Fire safety==
The Lower East Side is served by two New York City Fire Department (FDNY) fire stations:
* Engine Company 15/Ladder Company 18/Battalion 4 – 25 Pitt Street
* Engine Company 9/Ladder Company 6 – 75 Canal Street

<doc id="342602" wikidata="Q1129636" url="?curid=342602" title="Lehmann–Scheffé theorem">
<text>In statistics, the Lehmann–Scheffé theorem is a prominent statement, tying together the ideas of completeness, sufficiency, uniqueness, and best unbiased estimation. The theorem states that any estimator that is unbiased for a given unknown quantity and that depends on the data only through a complete, sufficient statistic is the unique best unbiased estimator of that quantity. The Lehmann–Scheffé theorem is named after Erich Leo Lehmann and Henry Scheffé, given their two early papers.

If formula_1 is a complete sufficient statistic for formula_2 and formula_3 then formula_4 is the uniformly minimum-variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) of formula_5.

==Statement==

Let formula_6 be a random sample from a distribution that has p.d.f (or p.m.f in the discrete case) formula_7 where formula_8 is a parameter in the parameter space. Suppose formula_9 is a sufficient statistic for &quot;θ&quot;, and let formula_10 be a complete family. If formula_11 then formula_12 is the unique MVUE of &quot;θ&quot;.

===Proof===

By the Rao–Blackwell theorem, if formula_13 is an unbiased estimator of &quot;θ&quot; then formula_14 defines an unbiased estimator of &quot;θ&quot; with the property that its variance is not greater than that of formula_13.

Now we show that this function is unique. Suppose formula_16 is another candidate MVUE estimator of &quot;θ&quot;. Then again formula_17 defines an unbiased estimator of &quot;θ&quot; with the property that its variance is not greater than that of formula_16. Then

:formula_19

Since formula_10 is a complete family

:formula_21

and therefore the function formula_22 is the unique function of Y with variance not greater than that of any other unbiased estimator. We conclude that formula_12 is the MVUE.

== Example for when using a non-complete minimal sufficient statistic ==

An example of an improvable Rao–Blackwell improvement, when using a minimal sufficient statistic that is not complete, was provided by Galili and Meilijson in 2016. Let formula_24 be a random sample from a scale-uniform distribution formula_25 with unknown mean formula_26 and known design parameter formula_27. In the search for &quot;best&quot; possible unbiased estimators for formula_28, it is natural to consider formula_29 as an initial (crude) unbiased estimator for formula_28 and then try to improve it. Since formula_29 is not a function of formula_32, the minimal sufficient statistic for formula_28 (where formula_34 and formula_35), it may be improved using the Rao–Blackwell theorem as follows: 

:formula_36

However, the following unbiased estimator can be shown to have lower variance: 

:formula_37 

And in fact, it could be even further improved when using the following estimator: 

:formula_38

The model is a scale model. Optimal equivariant estimators can then be derived for loss functions that are invariant.

<doc id="342611" wikidata="Q737484" url="?curid=342611" title="Seagram Building">
<text>The Seagram Building is a skyscraper at 375 Park Avenue, between 52nd and 53rd Streets, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. Designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe along with Philip Johnson, Ely Jacques Kahn, and Robert Allan Jacobs, the high-rise tower is tall with 38 stories. The International Style building, completed in 1958, initially served as the headquarters of the Seagram Company, a Canadian distiller.

Phyllis Lambert, daughter of Seagram CEO Samuel Bronfman, heavily influenced the Seagram Building&#x27;s design, an example of the functionalist aesthetic and a prominent instance of corporate modern architecture. A glass curtain wall with vertical mullions of bronze and horizontal spandrels made of Muntz metal form the building&#x27;s exterior. On Park Avenue is a pink-granite public plaza with two fountains. Behind the plaza is a tall elevator lobby with a similar design to the plaza. The lowest stories originally contained the Four Seasons Restaurant, which was replaced in 2017 with the Grill and Pool restaurants, and the Brasserie restaurant, which was superseded in 1995 by the Lobster Club. On the upper stories are modular office spaces.

Seagram revealed plans for the building in July 1954, when it announced construction of its headquarters on the up-and-coming commercial strip of Park Avenue. After Lambert objected to Pereira &amp; Luckman&#x27;s original design, Mies was selected as the architect that November. The building&#x27;s construction began in late 1955 and finished in 1958, although the official certificate of occupancy was not granted until 1959. The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA) purchased the building in 1979, and it remained Seagram&#x27;s headquarters until 2001. TIAA sold the building in 2000 to Aby Rosen&#x27;s RFR Holding LLC, which has continued to operate the structure.

Upon opening, the Seagram Building was widely praised for its architecture. Described in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of &quot;New York&#x27;s most copied buildings&quot;, the Seagram Building has inspired the designs of other structures around the world. Within New York City, the Seagram Building helped influence the 1961 Zoning Resolution, a zoning ordinance that allowed developers to construct additional floor area in exchange for including plazas outside their buildings. In 1989, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Seagram Building&#x27;s exterior, lobby, and The Four Seasons Restaurant as official city landmarks. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

==Site==
The Seagram Building is at 375 Park Avenue, on the east side of the avenue between 52nd and 53rd streets, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. The building was never officially named for its original anchor tenant, Canadian conglomerate Seagram, and is legally known only by its address. The building is assigned its own ZIP Code, 10152; it was one of 41 buildings in Manhattan that had their own ZIP Codes . The land lot has a frontage of on 52nd Street to the south, on Park Avenue to the west, and on 53rd Street to the north. The site slopes down to the east.

The 53rd Street side contains an alley about wide, facing 100 East 53rd Street; the alley allows the Seagram Building to remain symmetrical despite the site&#x27;s irregular shape. Other nearby buildings include 345 Park Avenue across 52nd Street to the south; 399 Park Avenue across 53rd Street to the north; Lever House diagonally across Park Avenue and 53rd Street; and the Racquet and Tennis Club Building and Park Avenue Plaza across Park Avenue to the west. In addition, 599 Lexington Avenue and the Citigroup Center, as well as the New York City Subway&#x27;s Lexington Avenue/51st Street station (served by the ), are on Lexington Avenue less than one block to the east.

During the late 19th century, the Seagram Building&#x27;s site had included the original Steinway &amp; Sons piano factory, as well as tenements made of brick or brownstone. The Park Avenue railroad line had run in an open cut in the middle of Park Avenue until the 1900s. The construction of Grand Central Terminal in the early 20th century covered the line, spurring development in the surrounding area, known as Terminal City. The adjacent stretch of Park Avenue became a wealthy neighborhood with upscale apartments, including the Montana Apartments, on the site of the piano factory. Largely commercial International Style skyscrapers replaced many of the residential structures on Park Avenue during the 1950s and 1960s. These skyscrapers included the Seagram Building, Lever House, the Union Carbide Building, and the Pepsi-Cola Building. When the Seagram site was assembled in the early 1950s, it contained the Montana Apartments and four smaller row houses and apartment buildings.

==Architecture==
German-American architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe designed the Seagram Building in the International Style. Philip Johnson was the co-architect and the partnership of Ely Jacques Kahn and Robert Allan Jacobs were the associate architects. Numerous consultants were involved in the building&#x27;s design, including mechanical engineers Jaros, Baum &amp; Bolles; structural engineers Severud-Elstad Krueger; electrical engineer Clifton E. Smith; lighting consultant Richard Kelly; acoustics consultant Bolt Beranek and Newman; graphics consultant Elaine Lustig; and landscape architects Charles Middeleer and Karl Linn.

Phyllis Lambert—a Bronfman family member and the daughter of Seagram CEO Samuel Bronfman, whose idea it was to develop the building—did not impose a budget on Mies. Lambert said the Seagram Building was supposed to &quot;be the crowning glory of everyone&#x27;s work, his own, the contractor&#x27;s, and Mies&#x27;s&quot;. The architects used new or redesigned materials if they believed these innovations provided an improvement over existing products. The design used costly, high-quality materials, including bronze, travertine, and marble. The lavish interior, overseen by Johnson, was designed to ensure cohesion with the appearance of the facade. The Seagram Building was the first office building in the world to use extruded bronze on a facade, as well as the first New York City skyscraper with full-height plate glass windows.

===Form===
The Seagram Building occupies half the site and is recessed behind Park Avenue. The building&#x27;s main section is a 38-story high-rise slab topped by a mechanical story; it does not include any setbacks. The slab rises above ground. As planned, the slab measured . Along the eastern end of the slab is a narrow shaft with an emergency-exit stair, which is sometimes referred to as the &quot;spine&quot;. The spine, which forms part of the building&#x27;s framework, contains restrooms on the sixth to tenth floor and offices above.

There are two five-story wings east of the main slab, facing 52nd and 53rd Streets. The 10-story central section between the wings is sometimes characterized as a &quot;bustle&quot;. As planned, the &quot;bustle&quot; measured while the wings measured . The April 1955 edition of &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; described the relative simplicity of the building&#x27;s massing as &quot;a no-setback building but a building all set back&quot;.

====Plaza====

A pink granite plaza with pools and greenery lies on the western side of the Seagram Building. The plaza is raised slightly above sidewalk level on Park Avenue, with three steps leading from the center of the Park Avenue frontage. A low granite retaining wall runs on either side of the flight of steps, extending around to 52nd and 53rd Streets, where they flank the building. There are marble caps atop the retaining walls on the side streets. At the eastern ends of the retaining walls on 52nd and 53rd Streets are granite steps from street to lobby, above which are travertine canopies. The parapets on the side streets each measure wide by long and are made of 40 pieces of green Italian marble.

The plaza is largely symmetrical with rectangular pools placed on the northwest and southwest corners. The southern pool contains a bronze flagpole, the only deviation from the design&#x27;s symmetry. The water level of the pools is just below that of the plaza. The cluster of fountain jets at the center of either pool is not part of the original design. The pools measure wide by long and each contain of water recirculated every two-and-a-half hours. The initial plan had been to place abstract sculptures in the plaza. Mies abandoned this when he could not find a sculptor he felt could produce work suited for the landscape. East of both pools are three planting beds with ivy and a gingko tree. These planting beds had contained weeping beeches before November 1959, when they were replaced with hardier gingko trees. The plaza contains a heating system to prevent ice buildup. At the building&#x27;s completion, the plaza&#x27;s surface required daily vacuuming with a sweeper.

From its construction, the plaza was intended not only as an urban green space but as a point of interest. Architecture critic Lewis Mumford said of the plaza: &quot;In a few steps one is lifted out of the street so completely that one has almost the illusion of having climbed a long flight of stairs.&quot; In its simplicity, the plaza&#x27;s design was a marked contrast to the Channel Gardens in front of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which architectural writer Robert A. M. Stern describes as being known for its festiveness.

===Facade===

The northern, southern, and western ends of the slab overhang the plaza and are supported by bronze-clad columns at their perimeters, forming an arcade in front of the entrance. Each column measures across and two stories tall. The arcade&#x27;s ceiling contains recessed light fixtures within a ceramic tile surface. The first-story walls behind the arcade contain full-height glass panes. Above the arcade, on the western side of the building, is a marquee made of Muntz metal, with recessed lighting. The bases of the wings on 52nd and 53rd Streets, beneath the first story, are clad in granite and contain entrances to the restaurant and bar spaces inside. The eastern portions of both wings contain garage doors, while the eastern wall of the 53rd Street wing is faced in brick. The eastern section of the 52nd Street wing has an entrance that leads to the Grill and Pool restaurant while bypassing the main lobby. A similar entrance exists on the 53rd Street wing to the Brasserie restaurant.

The curtain wall begins above the lower stories and is composed of non-structural glass walls, which are colored amber-gray. The glass panels cover about and are designed to be heat- and glare-resistant. Because the windows are sealed permanently, and the tower rises with no setbacks, the Seagram Building&#x27;s window washing team could not use standard window-washing equipment. Therefore, a custom-made pneumatic scaffold was installed, with a deck that covers six columns of windows at a time. Behind each window, Mies sought to avoid irregularity when window blinds were drawn. As a result, the building uses window blinds with slats angled in 45-degree positions, allowing the blinds to be set in three positions: fully open, halfway open, or fully closed.

The facade used of bronze, manufactured by the General Bronze Corporation at its plant in Garden City, New York. The glass panes are set within vertical bronze mullions made from extrusions of I-beams. The bronze mullions separate the facade into bays, or vertical spaces between columns; each bay contains five windows per floor. The tops and bottoms of the mullions are tapered, exposing their cross-sections. The Seagram Building&#x27;s mullions are only for aesthetics and are thus susceptible to thermal expansion and contraction. At the building&#x27;s completion, General Bronze said the facade would need to be cleaned twice a year with soap, water, and lemon oil to prevent discoloration; this work could be performed using the window-washing scaffold. Spandrels, made of Muntz metal, separate the windows on each story horizontally, which gives them an appearance similar to that of copper. A sample facade section, tested in a wind tunnel in 1956, was resistant to winds of up to .

The design of the slab&#x27;s facade is carried onto the wings and &quot;bustle&quot;. The &quot;spine&quot; on the eastern side of the slab is clad with serpentine marble panels instead of glass because of the presence of shear walls made from concrete. The curtain-wall facade cost , equivalent to in . Above the 38th story is a triple-height mechanical story with a louvered screen.

===Features===
The superstructure is a steel frame covered with concrete and gypsum. At the time, American building codes required that all structural steel be covered in a fireproof material, such as concrete, because improperly protected steel columns or beams may soften and fail in confined fires. The concrete core shear walls rise to the 17th floor, while the diagonal core bracing, with shear trusses, extends to the 29th floor. The structural system also includes steel columns whose centers are apart. The Seagram Building&#x27;s heating and air conditioning systems are divided into two sections: a basement unit serving the 20th story and all floors below, and a roof unit serving the 21st story and all floors above. Ducts for utilities such as electric, telephone, and closed-circuit television cables were embedded into the concrete floor slabs.

The Seagram Building has of floor space, including three basement stories. Inside the building were the Four Seasons and Brasserie restaurants, originally designed by Philip Johnson. The restaurant interiors were decorated with numerous artworks. These included the Seagram murals by Mark Rothko, which he claimed were intended to sicken the patrons of the Four Seasons Restaurant, as well as Pablo Picasso&#x27;s painted curtain &quot;Le Tricorne&quot;, designed for the Ballets Russes in 1919. By 2017, the building housed three restaurants owned by Major Food Group: the Pool, the Grill, and the Lobster Club. The Pool was merged with the Grill in 2020, though a separate event space called the Pool Lounge continues to operate.

====Basements====
Two of the basement levels originally contained a 150-space parking garage, connected to the lobby via its own elevator. Starting in 2019, the garage was renovated into a gym known as the Seagram Playground. Covering or , the gym was designed in a contrasting style to the original building to attract younger employees. It contains a multipurpose basketball, pickleball, and volleyball court with a climbing wall. Next to the court was a multipurpose exercise room, a training area, a spin bike room, and an open lounge. The gym could also be used as a 150-seat theater with eight tiers of wooden bleachers, and there are two conference rooms on a mezzanine overlooking the gym. The basements also contain storage, loading platforms, and service areas for the first-floor occupants.

====Lobby====
Unlike designs in Beaux-Arts office buildings, the Seagram Building&#x27;s lobby lacks a central space, instead leading visitors directly from the plaza to the elevators or restaurants. The lobby is designed as if it were an extension of the plaza, leading Mumford to write: &quot;Outside and inside are simply the same.&quot; It is divided into three parts: a western section facing the plaza; a central section with elevators; and an eastern section facing the restaurant space.

The western part of the lobby has three bronze revolving doors and is interrupted by two bronze columns. The central section comprises three corridors connecting the western and eastern thirds of the lobby, within four elevator and stair enclosures, whose walls are clad with travertine. There are three elevators on each corridor&#x27;s north and south walls—a total of eighteen elevators. The elevators abutting the northern corridor serve floors 25–38; those in the center corridor serve floors 2–10; and those in the southern corridor serve floors 10–25. The northernmost and southernmost elevator enclosures have fire stairs exiting to the plaza, and all enclosures have mechanical spaces and service closets. The interiors of the elevator cabs contain stainless steel and bronze mesh panels, while the ceilings contain white panels that illuminate each cab. Above the elevator doors are fluorescent lights installed in the doorway soffits. The central third of the lobby contains mailboxes, a standpipe alarm box, and service doors made of bronze.

The eastern section has two additional revolving doors within the northern and southern glass walls. A cross-passage connects the two sets of doors. There are service doors on the eastern wall of the cross-passage, as well as an elevator control panel, a fire station panel, and directories on the western wall. From the cross-passage, a set of travertine steps connects to the restaurant spaces that originally comprised the Four Seasons Restaurant.

Throughout the entire lobby, the -tall ceiling is made of black cement and gray glass mosaic tiles. Recessed within the lobby ceiling are lights with dimmers. The floors, walls, and columns are also clad with travertine. The exterior walls of the lobby contain bronze mullions within which the exterior glass panes are set. A horizontal bronze bar, about above the floor level, surrounds the exterior walls. The horizontal bronze bar was installed in the 1970s per New York state building regulations. Signs in the lobby were originally designed in a square serif font custom-made for the Seagram Building.

====The Grill and Pool====

The Grill and Pool (formerly the Four Seasons Restaurant) occupy two stories in the Seagram Building&#x27;s &quot;bustle&quot;, east of the lobby and main shaft. The upper story is just above the lobby, while the lower story is at ground level near 52nd and 53rd Streets. When they opened as separate restaurants in 2017, the Grill served mid-20th-century cuisine while the Pool largely served seafood. The Grill and Pool, named after the rooms of the same name in the former Four Seasons, contains similar design features to the lobby. It has travertine walls and floors, cement ceilings with gray-glass mosaic tiles, and bronze engaged piers. The original Four Seasons had five dining rooms, preserved in the modern-day Grill and Pool restaurant. The Pool is on the north side of the first floor; the Grill is on the south side. There are two dining areas on a balcony above the Grill, as well as a balcony above the Pool. A staircase leads down from the Grill Room to a separate entrance lobby and foyer on 52nd Street.

The Grill and Pool are discrete rooms. Both major rooms and their auxiliary spaces have ceilings with gridded off-white aluminum panels and recessed lighting. The outer walls are glass curtain walls, containing metal curtains that ripple from air released by hidden ventilating ducts. Running north–south between them is a corridor, which is at the top of the stairs leading from the eastern lobby. A glass wall and bronze double doors separate the corridor from the main lobby. The corridor&#x27;s north and south walls contain doors leading to vestibules outside either room. The Pool is centered around a white marble pool. On the eastern side of the Pool, a staircase connects to a mezzanine on a podium slightly above the main floor. The Grill had a lounge in its northwest corner and a bar at its southwest corner. The two private dining rooms are on a balcony raised above the main Grill, accessed by separate staircases and separated from the main Grill by walnut paneled doors.

====The Lobster Club====
The Lobster Club is at ground level on 53rd Street, immediately below the Pool room, within the space formerly occupied by Brasserie. It serves Japanese seafood. Philip Johnson had designed the original interior, which was damaged in a fire and redesigned by Diller + Scofidio from 1995 to 1999. During a 2017 renovation, the Lobster Club was redesigned by Peter Marino.

The entrance connects to a lobby with restrooms to the east, a coat check to the west, and the dining room to the south. The main dining room is slightly above the 53rd Street lobby, reached by a set of stairs. The lobby is on the north wall of the main dining room, while kitchens and waiters&#x27; stations are on the south wall. A second dining room is reached through a doorway at the center of the west wall. A door on the south wall leads to a fire stair to the lobby. The Lobster Club&#x27;s main dining room has brightly colored furniture and upholstery, 150 drip-painted concrete floor tiles by artist Laura Bergman, and three bronze-partitioned booths on the south wall. There is a bar on the eastern side of the dining room. The second dining room is a private suite with white partition walls, red terrazzo flooring, and metal sculptures.

The Brasserie had seated 150 patrons. When used by Brasserie, the foyer had contained a stone wall, and a video camera displayed images of patrons entering from the street, with an LCD sign announcing every customer&#x27;s entry. The main dining room had a U-shaped counter surrounded by circular tables and glass-partitioned dining alcoves. The room had wooden panels on its walls; a set of plates designed by Picasso was mounted onto the wooden paneling. The side walls contained booths, an allusion to the original booths that Johnson had designed for the space. The west wall contained a bar on its northern section and a dining alcove on its southern section. The bar, alcove, and second dining room had carpeted floors; the main dining room had wooden floors. The ceiling was made of flat plaster with recessed lighting fixtures. The rear wall of the main dining room contained a double-paned glass wall, behind which sculptures were placed. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s bathrooms used the same cast-resin sink and were decorated with hexagonal tiles.

====Office stories====
The office stories were intended to contain executive suites. The office floors generally have a flexible plan, arranged in modules around the elevator core. The flexibility of the office stories derives from the superstructures&#x27; wide bays. In general, each of the second through fourth stories has about of rentable office space; the fifth through tenth stories, around ; and the upper stories, around . Johnson mainly oversaw the interior design; all the materials were custom-designed for the Seagram Building.

The elevator landings have green terrazzo floors, travertine walls, gray elevator-door surrounds, and gypsum ceilings. The remaining office stories used modules. The elevator doors, suite doors, and partitions were designed to rise from floor to ceiling, which made the openings appear as though they were part of the paneling. Partition panels were designed with washable materials, which became standard after they were used in the Seagram Building. Doorknobs were made of lever handles instead of round knobs. The ceilings are acoustically tiled dropped ceilings. Each story&#x27;s ceiling is surrounded by luminous tiled panels, activated by a timer, which are arranged in a consistent band measuring about wide. The luminous panels, in turn, contain vinyl diffuser panels measuring wide. The rest of each story uses indirect lighting. Air conditioning fixtures are placed only above the floor slab, enabling the windows to be full-height glass walls.

The Seagram Company occupied the second through eighth stories when the building was completed. Philip Johnson, Phyllis Lambert, and J. Gordon Carr collaborated in the design of the Seagram offices. The offices had a reception room, containing tapestries and a travertine wall with Seagram&#x27;s seal. There was also an executive office with furniture designed by Mies. The executive suites contained an oak-paneled dining room and kitchen, which could double as a conference room. On three sides of the fifth floor were offices with oak paneling, luminous ceilings, and ocher carpeting. The outer offices on the fifth story were wider than on other floors, signifying that story&#x27;s function as an &quot;important&quot; floor. The fourth floor contained several large spaces for meetings and receptions, including a assembly room that could be partitioned into three sections. Floor-to-ceiling travertine partitions walled off the restrooms in the Seagram suites. Another feature of the Seagram suites was display lights that could retract into the ceiling when they were not being used. &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; described Seagram&#x27;s offices as setting &quot;a high standard&quot; for subsequent tenants.

==History==
After the 1933 repeal of Prohibition in the United States, Seagram Distiller&#x27;s CEO Samuel Bronfman began planning a large Manhattan headquarters, though this plan was not executed for almost two decades. Bronfman decided the headquarters should be situated somewhere on Park Avenue between 50th and 59th Streets, which was becoming a commercial area.

===Development===

==== Initial plans ====
In 1951, the company bought a lot on the eastern side of Park Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Street, across from Lever House, for $4 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Bronfman sought to develop a structure that would be considered an &quot;important building&quot;. He wanted the building to be completed by 1957, coinciding with the company&#x27;s centenary. According to Philip Johnson, the earlier Lever House had set an example for the construction of what became the Seagram Building. Ely Jacques Kahn sent a letter and a brochure to Bronfman in July 1951, requesting an interview with him. The next month, prominent lawyer Alfred L. Rose wrote a letter to Bronfman endorsing Kahn and Jacob&#x27;s work. Kahn, working with several rental agents, sketched numerous diagrams for the massing of a hypothetical tower on the site, which they called &quot;Operation Skytop&quot;. The only extant diagram, labeled as &quot;scheme 2&quot;, depicted a bulky tower rising from several shallow setbacks.

Bronfman met with Charles Luckman, the former president of Lever Brothers soap company, in June 1954. Bronfman told Luckman that he intended to build a 35-story office tower topped by an imported English castle. In July 1954, Seagram announced it would build a 34-story tower designed by Luckman and William Pereira, his partner in the firm Pereira &amp; Luckman. The structure was projected to cost $15 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Luckman, who had overseen the development of Lever House, said he was &quot;very happy to come back to Park Avenue for a repeat performance&quot;. Seagram&#x27;s building, as originally planned, would have contained a four-story base of marble and bronze topped by a 30-story metal-and-glass shaft. The design would have provided for an auditorium, film screening room, display rooms, and executive offices, as well as interior garden courts. Pereira &amp; Luckman filed plans for the tower with the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) the same month.

Pereira &amp; Luckman&#x27;s design attracted negative criticism when it was announced. According to the August 1954 edition of &quot;Architectural Forum&quot;, critics likened the building&#x27;s appearance to an &quot;enormous cigarette lighter&quot; and &quot;big trophy&quot;. Lambert, Bronfman&#x27;s 27-year-old daughter, was living in Paris when she saw a rendering of Pereira &amp; Luckman&#x27;s plan in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; Paris edition. Recounting the incident, Lambert said she had been &quot;boiling with fury&quot; at the proposal. Lambert wrote a letter to her father that August, arguing that any new headquarters should be a &quot;contribution&quot; to the city in addition to serving as a symbol of Seagram. In a 2013 book recalling the building&#x27;s development, Lambert wrote, &quot;This letter starts with one word repeated very emphatically...NO NO NO NO NO.&quot; To palliate his daughter, Bronfman offered to allow Lambert to select the marble that would be used on the building&#x27;s ground floor, an offer that she flatly refused.

==== Modified plans ====
At his friend Lou Crandall&#x27;s suggestion, Bronfman relented, allowing his daughter to find an alternate architect. Pereira &amp; Luckman&#x27;s design was still publicly marketed as a &quot;preliminary model&quot; but, as &quot;Interiors&quot; managing editor Olga Gueft said, media reports suggested the original plan &quot;had been dumped overboard&quot;. Lambert became heavily involved with the design and acquainted herself with Johnson, who was then the departmental director of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art. Following his recommendation, Lambert examined several leading modernist architects and conducted several interviews. Lambert selected Mies van der Rohe to design the building in November 1954; she described Mies&#x27;s buildings, such as 860–880 Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, as &quot;sublimely urban&quot;. Bronfman, having approved Mies&#x27;s selection, designated his daughter as the building&#x27;s planning director. Lambert received an annual salary of $20,000 from this position. Because Mies was not a licensed architect in New York state, Johnson was selected as a co-architect. At the time, Johnson had never designed a skyscraper before, so Crandall convinced Bronfman to hire Kahn and Jacobs as associate architects.

Mies, who had never designed a project in New York City, wished to design a simple slab. He was dissatisfied with the setbacks in most skyscrapers designed after the passage of the 1916 Zoning Resolution. Mies considered three alternatives for a slab behind a large plaza, with a facade divided into multiple bays. One plan called for a square tower; the second plan called for a 3-by-7-bay rectangle with three bays on Park Avenue; and the third plan called for a 5-by-3-bay rectangle with five bays facing Park Avenue. He created several scale models for the proposed structure. Ultimately, Mies selected the third plan, which Lambert praised. After the architects were selected, Seagram purchased some of adjacent land for $900,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). The land acquisition allowed the building to be set back from Park Avenue while complying with the 1916 Zoning Resolution, and it allowed passersby to see it from the street. Lambert recalled that Bronfman had only one requirement for Mies: that the tower not be placed on stilts.

====Construction====

Mies filed updated plans with the DOB in March 1955; the structure was projected to cost $20 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The DOB records listed Mies&#x27;s plans as a modification to Pereira &amp; Luckman&#x27;s original plans, rather than completely new ones. At the time, 20 of 250 existing tenants on the site had left. The April 1955 issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the proposed tower as one of several on Park Avenue that &quot;add up in sum to a boom&quot;. Upon Bronfman&#x27;s suggestion, the architects specified that the tower would be made of bronze and glass. Kahn had sketched an alternative design for the Seagram Building, which called for a significantly different massing than the one Mies had proposed. Lambert disapproved of the alternative plan, saying that Kahn was &quot;undermining Mies&#x27;s decisions&quot;, and Kahn ultimately acquiesced to using Mies&#x27;s design.

Demolition of existing buildings on the site began in September 1955 and was completed in March 1956. Mies moved to a nearby apartment to oversee the Seagram Building&#x27;s development, and he applied for membership in the American Institute of Architects (AIA)&#x27;s New York division, but was rejected in December 1955. He took the AIA rejection as an affront and moved back to Chicago, placing Johnson in full control of the building&#x27;s design. Kahn wrote in his diary that the project had encountered delays in April 1956. When Mies received a license to practice architecture in New York, he rejoined the project that June.

Construction of the superstructure began in May 1956, with the first major steel column installed at the beginning of the next month. Seven hundred workers fitted over 5,000 individual pieces of steelwork together, which weighed in aggregate . Because of a no-idling rule implemented in Midtown Manhattan, some truckers were ticketed while delivering steel beams to the work site, prompting them to strike temporarily until the rule was changed to allow deliveries. The steelwork&#x27;s construction involved bolting steel beams, rather than riveting them, to reduce noise; this work received an official &quot;Quiet City Award&quot; from the city. During construction, Lambert acted as the director of planning. She convinced the builders to carry through Mies&#x27;s original design, including minor details such as the brick bonding, which was hidden from view. The superstructure was topped out during December 1956, The building&#x27;s bronze and glass facade was installed starting in September 1956 and was completed in April 1957. According to Kahn&#x27;s diary, the architects discussed &quot;violent changes&quot; to the building&#x27;s cost and design in July 1957, though these changes were not implemented.

The Seagram Company moved into its offices in December 1957, and the Department of Buildings granted a temporary certificate of occupancy the next year. The Seagram Building officially opened on May 22, 1958, with the Seagram Company leasing the office space that it did not occupy. The Department of Buildings granted a permanent occupancy certificate in 1959. Including the $5 million land purchases, the project was estimated to cost $43 million, or about . The construction cost per square foot was about twice that of similar buildings in the city. Seagram vice president Arthur S. Margolin said in a 1989 interview that the building had cost approximately $40 million.

===Seagram ownership===

==== Late 1950s and 1960s ====

By July 1958, ninety percent of the Seagram Building&#x27;s space was rented. Tenants were willing to pay for space on the upper floors, compared to an average of about for ordinary new buildings. In the building&#x27;s first year of operation, the office space was expected to earn about a 13 percent return on investment. Cushman &amp; Wakefield was hired as the rental agency. Among the initial occupants were &quot;a number of industrial and service corporations&quot; involved in manufacturing, as well as Bethlehem Steel and Maruzen Oil. The building also housed Goodson-Todman Productions; the sales headquarters of Eagle Pencil; an industrial designer; a property manager; an art producer; a direct-mail advertising company; and various other commercial tenants. Restaurant Associates took ground-level space for the Four Seasons and Brasserie restaurants, which opened in 1959. Ultimately, the Seagram Building&#x27;s luxuriously designed spaces had 115 tenants, which were drawn partly because of Mies&#x27;s international stature. By 1961, there was a waiting list for space in the Seagram Building.

In its early years, the Seagram Building and its plaza were used for displays and exhibitions. For instance, in 1958, the building held an art show to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the United Nations. A sculptured head from the Mesoamerican Olmec civilization was displayed in the plaza in 1965. The World Monuments Fund displayed a moai head in the Seagram Building&#x27;s plaza in 1968 to draw attention to the artifacts on Easter Island, which were seen as endangered. &quot;Atmospheres and Environment XII&quot;, an environmental steel sculpture by Louise Nevelson, was installed at the Seagram Building&#x27;s plaza in 1971. Other sculptures or artworks erected in the Seagram Building and plaza included Barnett Newman&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Broken Obelisk&quot;, displayed in 1967, as well as Jean Dubuffet&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Milord la Chimarre&quot;, displayed in 1974.

In 1963, the New York City government gave the Seagram Company an award for the building&#x27;s &quot;notable contribution&quot; to the city and raised the company&#x27;s property taxes. The recalculated tax assessment of $21 million was based on the potential value if the building were to be demolished, whereas Seagram fought to keep the assessment at $17 million, based on the rental income it earned. The higher tax assessment was upheld by the New York Court of Appeals, a decision the Regional Plan Association criticized as potentially destroying &quot;the hope of great commercial architecture in New York State&quot;. Architectural writer Ada Louise Huxtable called the tax a beginning of the city&#x27;s &quot;architectural annihilation&quot;, saying the higher tax assessment was a &quot;special method of taxing architectural excellence&quot;. There was still high demand for office space in Midtown Manhattan, despite a myriad of new development in the area. For example, when real estate investment firm Realty Equities moved its headquarters to the Seagram Building in 1968, another company immediately offered to sublet Realty&#x27;s space at a much higher price.

==== 1970s ====
The Seagram Company eventually found its own headquarters&#x27; rent to be too high, giving up half of its in the building and moving approximately 600 of its 983 employees elsewhere in 1972. In a letter to mayor John Lindsay, Seagram officials attributed the relocation in part because of the high tax assessment on the Seagram Building. In 1971, building management conducted what city officials believed was the first voluntary fire drill at a New York City office building. During the 1970s, Seagram received several offers for the building from potential buyers, and the company contemplated selling it and leasing back its own space. 
Seagram had decided to retain ownership of the building by 1976, saying that the building brought publicity to the company. The same year, Bronfman&#x27;s son and Seagram&#x27;s president Edgar Bronfman Sr. asked the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) to grant city-landmark status to the building. The move surprised mayor Abraham Beame, since the city&#x27;s landlords typically attempted to prevent their buildings from being listed as landmarks. The LPC ultimately did not hold a hearing for the Seagram Building. LPC rules specified that individual New York City landmarks be at least 30 years old at the time of their designation; the building had been completed only 18 years earlier. Bronfman proposed that the LPC allow designations of buildings less than 30 years old if their owners supported landmark status, but no action was taken on the proposal.

=== TIAA ownership ===
In February 1979, Seagram offered the tower for sale at $75 million. In the absence of official landmark status, the company mandated that the new owner preserve the exterior and public spaces in their original condition. This was enforced by what was known as an Article 26 restriction, which protected the exterior, public interiors, and any other interior space within of the facade. The new owner was obligated to keep the building for at least fifteen years, and would have to take over the high land-assessment taxes. Seagram sold the building to the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA) for $85.5 million in June 1979, leasing some space back from them. This fee included $70.5 million for the structure and $15 million for the underlying land. As part of the sale, the building retained the &quot;Seagram&quot; name, although it was only identified on signage by its address. For decades after the sale, Lambert continued to be involved with the Seagram Building&#x27;s operation.

The TIAA, like the Seagram Company, supported landmark status for the building. In early 1988, just over thirty years after the Seagram Building had been completed, the TIAA filed documentation with the LPC requesting that the Seagram Building&#x27;s exterior, lobby, and plaza be considered for landmark status. The Four Seasons&#x27; operators also separately endorsed landmark designation for their restaurant&#x27;s interior in the Seagram Building. On October 3, 1989, the LPC designated the Seagram Building&#x27;s exterior, the lobby, and the Four Seasons Restaurant as landmarks. The Four Seasons was only the second restaurant interior in the city to be designated a landmark, after Gage and Tollner in Brooklyn. The New York City Board of Estimate ratified all three designations in January 1990. While the TIAA had strongly supported the exterior and lobby landmark designations, it sued the LPC in 1990 to have the designation for the Four Seasons removed. The TIAA argued that the restaurant was personal property and that the designation would force the restaurant to continue operating even if the owners wished to close it. The state&#x27;s Court of Appeals upheld the designation in 1993. The Brasserie, not covered in any of the landmark designations, was renovated in 1999 after being damaged by a fire in 1995.

===RFR ownership===

==== 2000s and 2010s ====
Real estate investor Aby Rosen entered a contract in October 2000 to purchase a majority ownership stake in the building for $375 million, completing his purchase that December. At the time, 99.5 percent of the building&#x27;s space was occupied, but only six original tenants remained. The following year, the Seagram Company moved its headquarters out of the building. Rosen&#x27;s RFR Holding retained ownership of the Seagram Building. Meanwhile, French media conglomerate Vivendi, which acquired the Seagram Company in 2000, started selling off the building&#x27;s art in 2003 to raise money. RFR received the LPC&#x27;s permission in 2005 to transfer unused development rights at the Seagram Building site to a neighboring building. In exchange, the Seagram Building&#x27;s owners would be required to keep the facade in near-original condition. 

The Seagram Building was nominated for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on January 12, 2006, and was added to the NRHP on February 24, 2006. RFR obtained full ownership of the Seagram Building in 2013, when it purchased a 14 percent stake from Harry Lis. In 2015, RFR decided to terminate Four Seasons&#x27; and the Brasserie&#x27;s leases ahead of schedule, and the restaurants were closed. RFR proposed changes to the Four Seasons&#x27; interior, including removing the glass wall between the Grill Room and Pool Room, as well as converting the wine cellar to restrooms. The LPC rejected RFR&#x27;s proposal to change the interior of The Four Seasons Restaurant, except for a carpet replacement, which the commission allowed. Annabelle Selldorf restored the physical structure while William Georgis oversaw the interior design. 

The Grill and the Pool were opened within the former Four Seasons space in mid-2017. That year, architect Peter Marino designed the Lobster Club within the former Brasserie space in the basement. In addition, the facade was restored in 2016, and RFR spent $400,000 to install waterproofing on the fountains and $250,000 to renovate the plaza benches. RFR was also planning to change the underground garage, which did not have landmark status. Initially, RFR did not seek the LPC&#x27;s permission to change the landmark-designated Four Seasons interior, only requesting permission in late 2017 after the renovations were completed. The LPC retroactively approved the renovations nearly two years later, with some modifications. To conform to the plans that the LPC had approved, the Pool&#x27;s lounge room was closed in December 2019 for a one-month renovation. The next month, the Grill took over the Pool because of higher demand for cuisine in the Grill.

==== 2020s to present ====
Rosen announced in mid-2020 that he would renovate much of the garage into the Seagram Playground, a communal workers&#x27; space and gym, over the following one and a half years. The communal space was announced as a way to attract tenants in light of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, as well as the departure of Wells Fargo, a major tenant. The Seagram Playground was completed in August 2022 for $25 million; at the time, 80 percent of the space in the building was occupied. &quot;Curbed&quot; wrote that the Seagram Playground was one of several large investments that Rosen had made in &quot;prime midtown real estate at a time when it hasn&#x27;t exactly bounced back&quot; from the pandemic. The building was almost fully occupied by the end of 2022, after firms such as Blue Owl Capital and Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice signed or renewed their leases.

Rosen and his partner Michael Fuchs sought to refinance the Seagram Building by early 2023, as a $783 million commercial mortgage-backed security loan on the building was expected to mature at the end of the year; the loan was extended that May. Rosen refinanced the building for $1.1 billion in December 2023 and renewed leases for more than of space during that year. In February 2025, Rosen refinanced the building again, obtaining a $1.2 million commercial mortgage-backed security loan from a syndicate led by Morgan Stanley.

==Impact==
===Reception===

When the Seagram Building was completed, Lewis Mumford described the structure as a &quot;Rolls-Royce&quot; of buildings and wrote that &quot;it has the aesthetic impact that only a unified work of art carried through without paltry compromises can have&quot;. In 1957, Thomas W. Ennis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote the building was &quot;one of the most notable of Manhattan&#x27;s post-war buildings&quot; and characterized its design as the high point of Mies&#x27;s career. Similarly, &quot;Progressive Architecture&quot; described the Seagram Building as &quot;probably the most heralded new building in the U.S.&quot; in 1958. According to &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; in 1958, &quot;Seagram challenges accepted skyscraper practice all the way down the line.&quot; At a meeting of the Italian Cultural Institute the following year, architect Gino Pollini said the Seagram Building was &quot;a masterpiece of functional and esthetic architecture&quot;.

Critical acclaim for the Seagram Building continued. Eight years after the building opened, Ada Louise Huxtable wrote that it was &quot;dignified, sumptuous, severe, sophisticated, cool, consummately elegant architecture&quot;. &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; described the lobby in 1975 as one of &quot;The Ten Best Lobbies in New York&quot;. In 1981, architectural writer G. E. Kidder Smith found the building and its features to be &quot;in toto incomparable&quot;. According to Jerold Kayden, who wrote about the building in 2000, the Seagram Building &quot;remains the city&#x27;s quintessential International Style masterpiece of &#x27;tower in the park&#x27; architecture&quot;. Ricardo Scofidio of Diller Scofidio + Renfro said the construction of the Seagram Building &quot;was the first time you really realized that architecture brought something to the city that didn&#x27;t exist&quot;. In 2001, architecture critic Herbert Muschamp referred to it as &quot;the Building of Two Millenniums,&quot; writing that it encompassed &quot;everything essential in Western architecture&quot;.

While the public and architectural critics generally appreciated the Seagram Building, there were also comments about the design&#x27;s drawbacks. Stern stated that there were negative remarks about the plaza&#x27;s &quot;austerity&quot; and the exterior&#x27;s lack of purity. Stern cited architect Louis Kahn, who believed the rear &quot;spine&quot; took away from the purity of the slab, though Kahn also said the hidden wind bracing made the building appear like &quot;a beautiful bronze lady in hidden corsets&quot;. While Mumford largely praised the design, he found the plaza&#x27;s pools and fountains to be a &quot;gross defect&quot; in what was otherwise a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Italian architecture writers Manfredo Tafuri and Francesco Dal Co, in their 1976 book &quot;Modern Architecture&quot;, wrote that the Seagram Building stood &quot;aloof from the city&quot; and saw the juxtaposition as a symbol of absence. Architect Frank Lloyd Wright dismissed the building as &quot;a whisky bottle on a playing card.&quot;

===Architectural recognition===
The Fifth Avenue Association called the Seagram Building the best edifice constructed on Park Avenue between 1956 and 1957. The city government gave the Seagram Company an award in 1963 for the building&#x27;s positive impact on the city&#x27;s beauty. The Board of Trade awarded its 1965 architecture prize to the building, citing its plaza, form, and material. The following year, the Municipal Art Society (MAS) gave a bronze plaque to the building, recognizing it as a &quot;modern landmark&quot;. Philip Johnson received the city&#x27;s Bronze Medallion for the Seagram Building&#x27;s design in 1979. Simultaneously, the AIA&#x27;s New York division gave the Seagram Company a special citation recognizing the company&#x27;s &quot;most elegant contribution to the art of architecture and the care with which it is maintained&quot;. 

A 1977 poll of American-architecture experts ranked the Seagram Building as the fifth-best structure in the U.S., while a 1982 poll of &quot;&quot; readers ranked the Seagram Building as the second-best. The AIA further recognized the Seagram Building in 1984 with a Twenty-five Year Award for its &quot;ability to stand to the test of time&quot;. In a survey of 170 AIA fellows the next year, the building was ranked second on a list of the &quot;most successful examples of architectural design&quot;.

===Design influence===

The Seagram Building&#x27;s plaza was popular immediately when the building opened, being frequented by both office workers and tourists. In 1971, the plaza was the setting of a planning study by sociologist William H. Whyte, whose film &quot;Social Life of Small Urban Spaces&quot;, produced with the Municipal Art Society of New York (MAS), records the daily patterns of people socializing around the plaza. Whyte praised the plaza as allowing a sense of choice, in that patrons could lie down or sit on the ledges or steps, despite their relatively plain design.

The plaza&#x27;s presence helped influence the 1961 Zoning Resolution, a zoning ordinance that allowed New York City developers to increase their edifices&#x27; maximum floor areas in exchange for adding open space in front of their buildings. This was in sharp contrast to the &quot;wedding cake&quot; model of the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which had required setbacks at regular intervals. Even before the 1961 zoning codes had been implemented, some New York City buildings followed the Seagram&#x27;s model of a slab behind a plaza, such as the Time–Life Building at 1271 Avenue of the Americas, the former Union Carbide Building at 270 Park Avenue, and the One Chase Manhattan Plaza building at 28 Liberty Street. of plazas were built in New York City in the decade after the zoning-code revision.

Paul Goldberger wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1976 that the Seagram Building was one of &quot;New York&#x27;s most copied buildings&quot;, its design having been copied in several structures internationally. According to William H. Jordy, these structures included 270 Park Avenue and the Inland Steel Building. Mies reused the building&#x27;s design for towers in Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Toronto, and a replica of the Seagram Building was constructed at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada. According to writer E. C. Relph, the design was &quot;widely in various and shapes by other architects&quot;, though Relph considered some of the other towers to be &quot;devoid of interesting copies&quot;.

In mid-2005, the Skyscraper Museum in Lower Manhattan asked 100 architects, builders, critics, engineers, historians, and scholars, among others, to choose their 10 favorites among 25 of the city&#x27;s towers. The Seagram Building came in second place behind the Chrysler Building, with 76 respondents placing it on their ballots.

<text>This list provides names given in history and traditions for people who appear to be unnamed in the Bible.

==Hebrew Bible==
===Serpent of Genesis===
Revelation 12 is thought to identify the serpent with Satan, unlike the pseudepigraphical-apocryphal Apocalypse of Moses (Vita Adae et Evae) where the Devil works with the serpent.

===Wives of the antediluvian patriarchs===
The pseudepigraphical Book of Jubilees provides names for a host of otherwise unnamed biblical characters, including wives for most of the antediluvian patriarchs. The last of these is Noah&#x27;s wife, to whom it gives the name of &quot;Emzara&quot;. Other Jewish traditional sources contain many different names for Noah&#x27;s wife.

The Book of Jubilees says that Awan was Adam and Eve&#x27;s first daughter. Their second daughter Azura married Seth. For many of the early wives in the series, &quot;Jubilees&quot; notes that the patriarchs married their sisters.

The &quot;Cave of Treasures&quot; and the earlier &quot;Kitab al-Magall&quot; (part of Clementine literature) name entirely different women as the wives of the patriarchs, with considerable variations among the extant copies.

The Muslim historian Ibn Ishaq (c. 750), as cited in al-Tabari (c. 915), provides names for these wives which are generally similar to those in &quot;Jubilees&quot;, but he makes them Cainites rather than Sethites, despite clearly stating elsewhere that none of Noah&#x27;s ancestors were descended from Cain.

===Cain and Abel&#x27;s sisters===
:Name: Aclima (or Calmana or Luluwa)
:source: Golden Legend, which also tells stories about many of the saints

Appears in the Bible at: Genesis 4:17

:Name: Delbora
:source: Golden Legend, which also tells stories about many of the saints

Appears in the Bible at: Genesis 4

See also: Balbira and Kalmana, Azura and Awan for alternate traditions of names.

=== Noah&#x27;s wife ===
:Name: &quot;Naamah&quot;
:Source: Midrash Genesis Rabbah 23:4

Appears in the Bible at: Genesis 4:22; Gen. 7:7

Daughter of Lamech and Zillah and sister of Tubal-cain (Gen. iv. 22). According to Abba ben Kahana, Naamah was Noah&#x27;s wife and was called &quot;Naamah&quot; (pleasant) because her conduct was pleasing to God. But the majority of the rabbis reject this statement, declaring that Naamah was an idolatrous woman who sang &quot;pleasant&quot; songs to idols.

See also Wives aboard the Ark for a list of traditional names given to the wives of Noah and his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

===Ham&#x27;s wife===

:Name: &quot;Egyptus&quot;
:Source: Book of Abraham  

Appears in the Bible in Genesis 7 and 6

The Mormon Book of Abraham, first published in 1842, mentions Egyptus (Abraham 1:23) as being the name of Ham&#x27;s wife; his daughter apparently had the same name (v. 25).

=== Nimrod&#x27;s wife ===
A large body of legend has attached itself to Nimrod, whose brief mention in Genesis merely makes him &quot;a mighty hunter in the face of the Lord&quot;. (The biblical account makes no mention of a wife at all.) These legends usually make Nimrod to be a sinister figure, and they reach their peak in Hislop&#x27;s &quot;The Two Babylons&quot;, which make Nimrod and his wife Semiramis to be the original authors of every false and pagan religion.

===Mother of Abraham===

Appear in the Bible at Matthew 2.
The Gospel does not state that there were, in fact, three magi or when exactly they visited Jesus, only that multiple magi brought three gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Nevertheless, the number of magi is usually extrapolated from the number of gifts, and the three wise men are a staple of Christian nativity scenes. While the European names have enjoyed the most publicity, other faith traditions have different versions. According to the &quot;Armenisches Kindheitsevangelium&quot;, the three magi were brothers and kings, namely Balthasar, king of India; Melqon, king of Persia; and Gaspar, king of Arabia. The Chinese Christian Church believes that the astronomer Liu Xiang was one of the wise men.

The various versions of Epiphanius differ on whether one of the sisters was named Maria or Anna.

=== The Innocents ===

* Names: Sicarius of Brantôme, St. Memorius
:Source: St. Helena
Appears in the Bible at: Matthew 2:6–18.

=== Herodias&#x27; daughter ===
* Name: Salome

=== Peter&#x27;s wife ===
* Name: Perpetua
:Source: Acts of Peter and The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity

=== Syrophoenician woman ===

Appears in the Bible at Mark 9.

Several early Christian writers recorded a legend that the child whom Jesus took in his arms in Mark 9 was St. Ignatius of Antioch.

=== Hæmorrhaging woman ===
* Name: Berenice
:Source: Apocryphal &quot;Gospel of Nicodemus&quot;
* Name: &quot;Veronica&quot;
:Source: Latin translation of the apocryphal &quot;Gospel of Nicodemus&quot; (Gos. Nicodemus 5:26)
Appears in the Bible at .

Veronica is a Latin variant of Berenice (). Veronica or Berenice obtained some of Jesus&#x27; blood on a cloth at the Crucifixion (see also: Veil of Veronica). Tradition identifies her with the woman who was healed of a bleeding discharge in the Gospel.

=== Samaritan woman at the well ===
* Name: Photini
:Source: Eastern Orthodox Church Tradition
Appears in the Bible at John 4:5–42.

In the tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the name of the woman at the well when she met Jesus is unknown, but she became a follower of Christ, received the name Photini in baptism, proclaimed the Gospel over a wide area, and was later martyred. She is recognized as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

=== Damned rich man ===
* Name: Nineveh
:Source: Coptic folklore
* Name: Phineas
:Source: Pseudo-Cyprian, &quot;De pascha computus&quot;
* Name: Dives
:Source: European Christian folklore
Appears in the Bible at .

&quot;Dives&quot; is simply Latin for &quot;rich&quot;, and as such may not count as a proper name. The story of the blessed Lazarus and the damned rich man is widely recognised under the title of &quot;Dives and Lazarus&quot;, which may have resulted in this word being taken for a proper name.

=== Woman taken in adultery ===
* Name: Mary Magdalene
:Source: Western Christian tradition
Appears in the Bible at John 8.

A long-standing Western Christian tradition first attested by Pope Gregory I identifies the woman taken in adultery with Mary Magdalene, and also with Mary of Bethany. Jesus had exorcised seven demons out of Mary Magdalene (Mark ), and Mary Magdalene appears prominently in the several accounts of Jesus&#x27; entombment and resurrection, but there is no indication in the Bible that clearly states that Mary Magdalene was the same person as the adulteress forgiven by Jesus. Roman Catholics also have identified Mary Magdalene as the weeping woman who was a sinner, and who anoints Jesus&#x27; feet in , and while the Church has dropped this interpretation to a degree, this remains one of her more famous portrayals.

The Eastern Orthodox Church has never identified Mary Magdalene as either the woman taken in adultery, or the sinful woman who anointed Jesus&#x27; feet.

=== The man born blind ===
* Name: Celidonius
:Source: Christian tradition
Appears in the Bible at John .

* Name: Claudia, Procla, Procula, Perpetua or Claudia Procles

Appears in the Bible at .

During the trial of Jesus the wife of Pontius Pilate sent a message to him saying, &quot;Have nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.&quot;

The proposed names of Procla and Procula may not be names at all, but simply a form of Pilate&#x27;s official title of Procurator, indicating that she was the Procurator&#x27;s wife.

=== Thieves crucified with Jesus ===
* Names: Titus and Dumachus
:Source: &quot;Arabic Gospel of the Infancy of the Saviour&quot;
* Names: Dismas and Gestas (or Gesmas)

<doc id="342620" wikidata="Q128576" url="?curid=342620" title="Lady Diana Cooper">
<text>Diana Cooper, Viscountess Norwich (née Lady Diana Olivia Winifred Maud Manners; 29 August 1892 – 16 June 1986) was an English silent film actress and aristocrat who was a well-known social figure in London and Paris. 

As a young woman, she moved in a celebrated group of intellectuals known as the Coterie, most of whom were killed in the First World War. She married one of the few survivors, Duff Cooper, later British ambassador to France. 

After his death, she wrote three volumes of memoirs which reveal much about early 20th-century upper-class life.

==Birth and youth==

Lady Diana Olivia Winifred Maud Manners was born at 23A Bruton Street in Mayfair, London, on 29 August 1892. Her mother, who was a devotee of the author George Meredith, named her daughter after the titular character in Meredith&#x27;s novel &quot;Diana of the Crossways&quot;. Officially the youngest daughter of the 8th Duke of Rutland and his wife, the Duchess of Rutland, Lady Diana&#x27;s biological father was the writer Harry Cust. As early as 1908, various pamphlets were being circulated by a former governess claiming that Cust fathered Diana Manners, and David Lindsay (a distant cousin of her mother) noted in his diary that the resemblance was said to be striking. Cooper herself did not become aware of this until it was casually mentioned to her by Edward Horner at a party after she had come out into society, though &quot;It didn’t seem to matter—I was devoted to my father and I liked Harry Cust too.&quot; She later wrote to a friend that &quot;I am cheered very much by &quot;Tom Jones&quot; on bastards and I like to see myself as a living monument to incontinence.&quot;

In her prime, she had the widespread reputation as the most beautiful young woman in England, and appeared in countless profiles, photographs and articles in newspapers and magazines. She became active in the Coterie, an influential group of young English aristocrats and intellectuals of the 1910s whose prominence and numbers were cut short by the First World War. Some see them as people ahead of their time, precursors of the Jazz Age.

Lady Diana was the most famous of the group, which included Raymond Asquith (son of H. H. Asquith, the prime minister), Patrick Shaw-Stewart, Edward Horner, Sir Denis Anson, Billy and Julian Grenfell, and Duff Cooper. Diana nurtured a love for the married Asquith, and she became close friends with both him and his wife, Katherine. 

His death in the First World War devastated her, and was compounded by the loss of other men in her circle: Horner, Charles Lister, Julian and Billy Grenfell and Shaw-Stewart in the war; Anson by drowning. Lady Diana married Cooper, one of her circle of friends&#x27; last surviving male members, in June 1919. It was not a popular choice with Diana&#x27;s parents who took a dim view of his lack of title and wealth, and his drinking, gambling and womanising. They had hopes for a marriage to the Prince of Wales. As for Cooper, he once impulsively wrote a letter to Lady Diana, before their marriage, declaring, &quot;I hope everyone you like better than me will die very soon.&quot; 

In 1929, she gave birth to her only child, John Julius Cooper, later the 2nd Viscount Norwich and known as John Julius Norwich, who became a writer and broadcaster.

==Career on stage and in silent films==
She worked as a Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) nurse at Guy&#x27;s Hospital during the war, and later at a hospital for officers her mother set up in London (though she annoyed her co-workers with her inconsistent attendance, and tendency to take off with friends). She also worked briefly as editor of the magazine &quot;Femina&quot;, and she wrote a column in the Beaverbrook newspapers before turning to acting. Her work as a VAD nurse increased her popularity and public notoriety. Her name appears in the wartime version of the music hall song &quot;Burlington Bertie&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ll eat a banana/with Lady Diana/Aristocracy working at Guy&#x27;s&quot;.

In 1918 Lady Diana took uncredited film roles; in &quot;The Great Love&quot; she played herself in her capacity of a celebrity. She also appeared in a propaganda film for the war effort, &quot;Hearts of the World&quot;, directed by D.W. Griffith, who chose her because he thought her &quot;the most beloved woman in England&quot;. A few years later she starred in two of the first British colour films: &quot;The Glorious Adventure&quot; (1922) and &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot; (1923); in the latter she played Queen Elizabeth I. Then she turned to the stage, playing the Madonna in the 1924 revival of &quot;The Miracle&quot; (directed by Max Reinhardt). The play achieved outstanding international success, and she toured on and off for twelve years with the cast.

==Social figure, wife of ambassador ==
In 1924 she lent her fame to her husband&#x27;s successful campaign for election to Parliament, canvassing on his behalf in Oldham. The Coopers were friends with Edward VIII, and were guests of his on a 1936 yacht cruise of the Adriatic which famously caused his affair with Wallis Simpson to become publicly known for the first time.

She supported her husband in his political posts, even travelling with him to the Far East in late 1941 prior to the Japanese attack on British Malaya. As Prime Minister Churchill&#x27;s personal representative, Duff Cooper MP was unsuccessful in effecting a positive strategy, and he was recalled in January 1942, shortly before Singapore fell in February. In between accompanying her husband on his wartime appointments abroad, Lady Diana converted her three-acre property at Bognor Regis into a smallholding to provide her family with extra food in light of shortages and rationing. Aided by her friend Conrad Russell, she raised livestock, grew crops, practised beekeeping, and made her own butter and cheeses. She also volunteered at a YMCA canteen, and worked briefly in a workshop making camouflage nets for gunners.

Between January and August 1944 the couple lived in Algiers, where Duff Cooper was appointed British Representative to the Free French Committee of National Liberation. Lady Diana focused her energies as a hostess on making an &quot;Eden&quot; of the couple&#x27;s home for British civil servants stationed in Algiers, who were poorly housed in unheated and waterless lodgings and &quot;had no retreats, amenities, sports or welcomes.&quot; The Coopers&#x27; home provided British personnel an outlet for rest, socializing, good food, and recreation. Her reputation became even more celebrated in France as the centrepoint of immediate post-Second World War French literary culture when Cooper served from 1944 to 1948 as Britain&#x27;s ambassador to France. During this period, Lady Diana&#x27;s popularity as a hostess remained undimmed, even after allegations that the embassy guest list included &quot;pederasts and collaborators&quot;. The couple were known for maintaining an &quot;open house&quot; every evening where leading cultural figures and diplomats could come freely to socialize, while enjoying good food and plentiful liquor provided by the British government, both luxuries in Paris after years of wartime shortages.

Following Duff Cooper&#x27;s retirement in 1947, the couple continued to live in France at Chantilly, until his death in 1954, following an alcohol related upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The couple&#x27;s decision to remain in France was controversial because it was contrary to diplomatic protocol; their continuing popularity as social figures and hosts in Paris effectively made their home a rival British Embassy. She was a prominent guest at &quot;Le Bal Oriental&quot; hosted by Carlos de Beistegui at the Palazzo Labia in Venice in 1951. Known as the &quot;Ball of the Century&quot;, Lady Diana dressed as Cleopatra and greeted her fellow guests, some 1,000 people, in a vestibule pageant. Duff Cooper was created Viscount Norwich in 1952, for services to the nation, but Lady Diana refused to be called Viscountess Norwich, claiming that it sounded like &quot;porridge&quot;. Following her husband&#x27;s death, she made an announcement in &quot;The Times&quot; to this effect, stating that she had &quot;reverted to the name and title of Lady Diana Cooper&quot;.

==Later years==
Lady Diana sharply reduced her activities in the late 1950s but produced three volumes of memoirs: &quot;The Rainbow Comes and Goes&quot;, &quot;The Light of Common Day&quot;, and &quot;Trumpets from the Steep&quot;. The three volumes are included in a compilation called &quot;Autobiography&quot; (). She died at her home in Little Venice, in West London, in 1986 at the age of 93, after many years of increasing infirmity. Her body was interred within the Manners family mausoleum at Belvoir Castle.

==Books about or influenced by Lady Diana==
Philip Ziegler wrote &quot;Diana Cooper: A Biography&quot; () in 1981; it was published by Hamish Hamilton. Several writers used her as inspiration for their novels, including Evelyn Waugh, who fictionalised her as Mrs. Stitch in the &quot;Sword of Honour&quot; trilogy and elsewhere, and Nancy Mitford, who portrayed her as the narcissistic, self-dramatizing Lady Leone in &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Alfred&quot;. In F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s short story &quot;The Jelly-Bean&quot;, the character Nancy Lamar states that she wants to be like Lady Diana Manners. Enid Bagnold published &quot;The Loved and Envied&quot; () in 1951. The novel, based on Lady Diana and her group of friends, dealt with the effects of ageing on a beautiful woman. Oliver Anderson dedicated &quot;Random Rendezvous&quot;, published in 1955, to &quot;Diana Cooper and Jenny Day&quot;.

&quot;Diana Cooper Autobiography&quot;: &quot;The Rainbow Comes and Goes&quot; (1958), &quot;The Light of Common Day&quot; (1959), &quot;Trumpets from the Steep&quot;, (1960) () was published as a trilogy by Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers Inc. New York 1985, second printing 1988, and republished by Faber &amp; Faber in the &#x27;Faber Finds&#x27; series, 2011.

In 2013, her son, John Julius Norwich, edited a volume of her letters to him as a youth entitled &quot;Darling Monster: The Letters of Lady Diana Cooper to Her Son John Julius Norwich&quot;. Published by Chatto &amp; Windus, . Rachel Cooke in &quot;The Guardian&quot; says &quot;Cooper&#x27;s letters have a special immediacy and frankness ... they are conspiratorial.&quot;

<text>The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System was created by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-542), enacted by the U.S. Congress to preserve certain rivers with outstanding natural, cultural, and recreational values in a free-flowing condition for the enjoyment of present and future generations.

The Act is notable for safeguarding the special character of these rivers, while also recognizing the potential for their appropriate use and development. It encourages river management that crosses political boundaries and promotes public participation in developing goals for river protection. The Act, signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in the height of the United States environmental era, states:&quot;It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States that certain selected rivers of the Nation which, with their immediate environments, possess outstandingly remarkable scenic, recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife, historic, cultural or other similar values, shall be preserved in free-flowing condition, and that they and their immediate environments shall be protected for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations. The Congress declares that the established national policy of dams and other construction at appropriate sections of the rivers of the United States needs to be complemented by a policy that would preserve other selected rivers or sections thereof in their free-flowing condition to protect the water quality of such rivers and to fulfill other vital national conservation purposes.&quot; (Wild &amp; Scenic Rivers Act)The Act established the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System to protect and enhance rivers found to be regionally and nationally significant. Rivers may be designated by Congress or, if certain requirements are met, the secretary of the interior. Each designated river is administered by either a federal, state, or tribal agency, or as a partnership between any number of these government entities and local NGOs. Designated segments need not include the entire river and may include headwaters and tributaries. For federally administered rivers, the designated boundaries generally average one-quarter mile on either bank in the lower 48 states and one-half mile on rivers outside national parks in Alaska in order to protect river-related values.

As of August 2018, the National System protects over of 209 rivers in 40 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; this is less than one-quarter of one percent of the nation&#x27;s rivers, which flow over 3.5 million miles (5,600,000 kilometers) across the United States. By comparison, more than 75,000 large dams across the country have modified at least , or about 17 percent of American rivers.

==History==

The National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act was an outgrowth of the recommendations of a Presidential commission, the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission (ORRRC). Among other things, the commission recommended that the nation protect wild rivers and scenic rivers from development that would substantially change their free-flowing nature and values. At this time, the country was also experiencing rapid degradation of its water resources due to municipal and industrial effluent being released into the nation&#x27;s rivers. Many waterways and the fish in them were toxic, rendering them unusable by surrounding communities. Populations of aquatic species were declining and people were being relocated from their communities due to rampant dam building. All across the country people were writing letters imploring the President and First lady to protect their beloved rivers. Ultimately, the act was sponsored by Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) and signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on October 2, 1968. A river, or river section, may be designated by the U.S. Congress or the Secretary of the Interior. In 1968, as part of the original act, eight rivers were designated as National Wild and Scenic Rivers (Clearwater, Eleven Point, Feather, Rio Grande, Rogue, St. Croix, Salmon, and Wolf). , 209 rivers, totaling 12,754 miles of river in 40 states and Puerto Rico, have Wild and Scenic status. By comparison, more than 75,000 large dams across the country have modified at least 600,000 miles, or about 17%, of American rivers.

Selected rivers in the United States are preserved for possessing Outstandingly Remarkable Values (ORVs) that fall into the 8 categories: Scenic, Recreation, Geologic, Fish, Wildlife, Historic, Culture, or Other similar values. These values can be considered synonymous with ecosystem services, or those goods and services that nature provides freely and that ultimately benefit society. Rivers (or sections of rivers) so designated are set out for protection and enhancement in perpetuity by preserving their free-flowing condition from dams and development that would otherwise diminish the quality of their remarkable values. National Wild and Scenic designation essentially vetoes the licensing of new dams on, or directly affecting the designated section of river. It also provides strong protection against federally funded bank and channel alterations that adversely affect river values, protects riverfront public lands from new oil, gas, and mineral development, and creates a federal reserved water right to protect flow-dependent values such as fish habitat.

In 2018, America continues to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.

On August 2, 2018, of East Rosebud Creek in Montana were designated as a Wild and Scenic, the first Wild and Scenic designation in Montana in over 40 years.

==Classifications==

Designation as a Wild and Scenic River specifically protects the free-flowing nature of rivers in both federal and non-federal areas, something the Wilderness Act and other federal designations cannot do. Despite misplaced fears, WSR designation does not alter private property rights.

Federally administered National Wild and Scenic Rivers are managed by one or more of the four principal land-managing agencies of the federal government. Of the 209 National Wild and Scenic Rivers, the majority are managed by the United States Forest Service, followed by the National Park Service; ten of those managed by the NPS are official units, while most are part of other parks. The remaining WSR are managed under the Bureau of Land Management&#x27;s National Conservation Lands, originally called the National Landscape Conservation System, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska.

State-managed Wild and Scenic Rivers are subject to the same protections as federally administered rivers. These state rivers can be added to the National System by the Secretary of the Interior following an application by the governor of the state the river flows through.

Designated rivers are assigned one or more classifications: Wild, Scenic, or Recreational. These classifications are based on the developmental character of the river&#x27;s surroundings on the date of designation. Wild rivers are the most remote and undeveloped while Recreational rivers often have many access points, roads, railroads, bridges, and homes located within the designated corridor. Scenic rivers tend to fall somewhere between the Wild and Recreational level of development. It is important to note that a river&#x27;s classification is not related to the value(s) that made it worthy of designation. For instance, recreation may not be an outstanding value on a river with a recreational classification, nor scenery on a river classified as scenic. Notably, Wild and Scenic Rivers receive the same standard of protection regardless of classification.

<text>Research Natural Area is a designation for certain protected areas in the United States. 

Research Natural Areas (RNAs) are part of a nationwide network of ecological areas set aside for both research and education. The network includes areas managed by many Federal agencies. The United States Forest Service and other agencies establish these areas to typify certain types of important forest, shrubland, grassland, aquatic, geological, alpine, or similar environments that have unique characteristics of scientific interest. The areas &quot;contain important ecological and scientific values and are managed for minimum human disturbance&quot;. The first RNA was established on the Coronado National Forest in Arizona in 1927.

The Bureau of Land Management is another agency that designates and manages Research Natural Areas. According to the Bureau of Land Management, the objectives of the RNA program are &quot;(1) To preserve examples of all significant natural ecosystems for comparison with those influenced by man; (2) to provide educational and research areas for ecological and environmental studies; and (3) to preserve gene pools of typical and endangered plants and animals. Research natural areas are intended to represent the full array of North American ecosystems with their biological communities, habitats, natural phenomena, and geological and hydrological formations.&quot; The Bureau of Land Management manages 192 RNAs with a total area of . 

, the US Forest Service managed 289 established RNAs and more than 300 candidate RNAs. , there were 571 US Forest Service RNAs (Note that these are not complete lists): 

These areas are established under the Organic Act of 1897. Areas designated as Research Natural Areas are primarily located inside National Forests.

<text>Sir Alfred Cooper (28 January 1838 – 3 March 1908) was a fashionable English surgeon and clubman of the late 19th century whose patients included Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. 

Cooper was born in Bracondale, Norfolk, England, the son of William Cooper, barrister, by his wife Anna, née Marsh. He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School. As a doctor and surgeon, his speciality was in venereal disease, which gave him an unusual degree of access to, and perspective on, late Victorian aristocrats and their notions of morality.

He was appointed a Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel to the Loyal Suffolk Hussars on 17 May 1899. The Hussars was a Yeomanry regiment, which was embodied for active service in South Africa during the Second Boer War (1899–1902). Cooper was the senior medical officer to the regiment until he resigned his commission on 8 November 1902.

He was knighted for services to medicine in the 1902 Coronation Honours, receiving the accolade from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October that year.

== Marriage and issue ==

Cooper became the third husband of Lady Agnes Cecil Emmeline Duff, daughter of Agnes Duff, Countess Fife, and was devoted to her all his life. Lady Agnes Duff&#x27;s first husband, Viscount Dupplin, was the eldest son of the 12th Earl of Kinnoull (issue one daughter), and her second husband had been a certain Herbert Flower (brother of Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea) (no issue). 

Lady Agnes Duff was the youngest daughter of James Duff, 5th Earl Fife by his wife, Lady Agnes Hay, herself the daughter of William Hay, 18th Earl of Erroll and granddaughter of King William IV by his mistress, the actress Dorothy Jordan. 

Lady Agnes Duff&#x27;s brother, Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife, was the husband of Louise, Princess Royal, the eldest daughter of King Edward VII.

Cooper and his wife had four children together.

== Death ==
Cooper died in Menton, France, in 1908.

<doc id="342629" wikidata="Q6318238" url="?curid=342629" title="Paradise Towers">
<text>Paradise Towers is the second serial of the 24th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts from 5 to 26 October 1987.

In the serial, Kroagnon, the incorporeal architect of the giant residential building Paradise Towers, takes over the body of the Chief Caretaker (Richard Briers) so he can kill everyone in the Towers.

==Plot==

The Seventh Doctor and Mel, looking for a swimming pool, land in Paradise Towers, a luxurious 22nd-century high-rise apartment building which has now fallen into disrepair and chaos. It is divided between the Caretakers who maintain the building and roaming gangs of young girls called Kangs, grouped in colour theme; the Doctor and Mel encounter the Red Kangs.

The Chief sends a squad of Caretakers to arrest the Red Kangs and in the ensuing confusion the Doctor is split from Mel and captured by the Caretakers. Mel meanwhile heads off to an apartment in which two elderly residents (&quot;&quot;) live. Tilda and Tabby explain that all the able-bodied residents left the Towers to fight a war, leaving behind only children and the elderly. The only other man still loose in the Towers is Pex, a would-be hero, who appoints himself Mel&#x27;s guardian.

At the Caretaker control centre, the Doctor meets the Chief Caretaker, who greets him as the Great Architect Kroagnon, designer of Paradise Towers, and orders him killed. The Doctor cites an imaginary rule from the Caretakers&#x27; manual, confusing them enough to make his escape. Mel and Pex meanwhile are captured by a party of Blue Kangs who reveal to Mel that Pex is a coward and only survived by fleeing and hiding.

The Doctor is reunited with the Red Kangs who explain that Kangs and Caretakers have been disappearing in ever greater numbers. Meanwhile, Mel has visited Tilda and Tabby again and soon finds herself under threat when it emerges they are cannibals and plan to eat her. After escaping, both Tabby and Tilda are killed by a mechanical claw from their waste disposal unit.

The Chief Caretaker has been allowing the robotic cleaners to kill anybody they encounter, and after reading a sales brochure for the Towers, the Doctor remembers that Kroagnon also designed &quot;Miracle City&quot; - a cutting-edge development which used its automation to kill its occupants. The Doctor surmises that Kroagnon inhabits Paradise Towers in the basement, and thinks that inhabitants ruin his creations, so kills them off whenever possible.

Mel and Pex finally find the swimming pool. When Mel takes a dip in the pool, she is attacked by a crablike robot. Pex&#x27;s cowardice prevents him from rescuing Mel, and she has to save herself which embarrasses Pex. Mel leaves to find the Doctor, and Pex trails behind her.

The Blue and Red Kangs encounter and fight each other, but the Doctor persuades them that their game is over, and they must work together in order to defeat Kroagnon. As the Cleaners begin killing everybody, the surviving Rezzies and caretakers join forces with the Doctor and the Kangs to defeat Kroagnon. They plan to lure Kroagnon (now inhabiting the body of the Chief Caretaker) into a booby trapped room, but the plan fails. Pex sacrifices himself to drag the Chief into the trap.

After a period of reflection and Pex&#x27;s funeral, the Doctor and Mel leave, trusting the remaining Kangs, Rezzies, and Caretakers to build a better society. As the TARDIS dematerialises, a new piece of Kang graffiti is revealed – &quot;Pex Lives&quot;.

==Production==

Working titles for this story included &quot;The Paradise Tower&quot;. The 1975 J. G. Ballard novel &quot;High-Rise&quot; has been cited as an influence.

The music was originally meant to be provided by a member of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, but producer John Nathan-Turner had decided that the incidental music no longer needed to be produced in-house. Instead, freelance composer David Snell was hired to provide the score, but Nathan-Turner terminated the commission very late in the production as he was unsatisfied with the way the score was done. Snell&#x27;s original score was kept, albeit in lower quality, and is available on the DVD release of the story as an alternative soundtrack. Keff McCulloch provided the final score at short notice. Originally only booked to score &quot;Time and the Rani&quot; and &quot;Delta and the Bannermen&quot; for Season 24, he composed the replacement score to Paradise Towers in a week.

The swimming pool scene involving Mel and a pool-cleaning robot was filmed at Elmswell House near Chalfont St. Giles.

===Cast notes===
Nisha Nayar, an uncredited extra playing one of the Red Kangs, later appeared in a more substantial speaking part as the Female Programmer in the 2005 two-part story &quot;Bad Wolf&quot; and &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;. This made her the second performer to appear in both the classic and new series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

Julie Brennon, who played Fire Escape, was married at the time to Mark Strickson, who had been the Fifth Doctor&#x27;s companion Vislor Turlough. Richard Briers – The Chief Caretaker – later appears in the &quot;Torchwood&quot; episode &quot;A Day in the Death&quot; as Henry Parker. See also Celebrity appearances in Doctor Who. Clive Merrison previously played Jim Callum in &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;.

According to the extensive production documentation released with the 2021 Blu-ray box set edition of the series, both Rosemary Leach and Frances Cuka were offered the role of Maddy (Cuka being confirmed before withdrawing), Philip Jackson and later Roger Daltrey were both offered the role of the Deputy Chief Caretaker and Ronald Lacey, Ian Richardson, Denis Quilley and Edward Hardwicke were all formally offered the role of the Chief Caretaker.

==Reception==
In a 2007 comedy article, Digital Spy named &quot;Paradise Towers&quot; Episode 4 as one of the reasons for swimming pool phobia.

Richard Briers&#x27; performance has attracted considerable criticism. In the DVD special features, it is mentioned that both John Nathan-Turner and Andrew Cartmel were concerned about his performance during the recording of scenes later in the story where his character&#x27;s body is inhabited by Kroagnon, and Briers admits he ignored directions to tone it down. Patrick Mulkern, writing for &quot;Radio Times&quot;, described Briers&#x27; performance as a &quot;career low&quot;, stating Briers is &quot;shockingly bad in this story...there’s no escaping the fact that the Chief Caretaker, the key baddie in Paradise Towers, is just Richard Briers in a silly cap, silly moustache, putting on a silly voice. Mugging for England. Sending up &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in a horribly misjudged, self-indulgent performance, especially after the Caretaker has been &#x27;zombified&#x27; by the Great Architect. Briers growls and clomps about like an embarrassing dad playing the Bogeyman. It plunges an already teetering production into the abyss.&quot;

A critical analysis of the story was published as part of the Black Archive series of books from Obverse Books. The book won the Sir Julius Vogel Award for Best Professional Publication in 2023.

<doc id="342631" wikidata="Q7084506" url="?curid=342631" title="Old Men Forget">
<text>Old Men Forget is a 1953 autobiography by Duff Cooper, Viscount Norwich, detailing his Victorian childhood, Edwardian youth, and work in literature and politics. 

==Publishing history, content and reception==
The title is taken from the St Crispin&#x27;s Day Speech by King Henry in Act IV, Scene 3 of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
 Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot
 But he&#x27;ll remember with advantages
 What feats he did that day. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

Despite the title, Cooper was in his early sixties when he wrote the book, having retired from public life in 1947 at the age of fifty-seven. The publisher Rupert Hart-Davis, who was Cooper&#x27;s nephew, published the first edition in November 1953.

The book covers Cooper&#x27;s early years – his schooldays at Eton, studies and socialising at Oxford – followed by his army service in the First World War, in which he fought in the trenches and was one of the few members of his intimate circle to survive the war. In peacetime he was an official in the Foreign Office until entering Parliament in 1924. The book includes an account of Field Marshal Allenby&#x27;s struggles with David Lloyd George over Egypt, seen from Cooper&#x27;s viewpoint as a public servant. The bulk of the book deals with Cooper&#x27;s political career in the Conservative Party, as an MP and minister. His accounts of the appeasement years before the Second World War include severe criticism of Neville Chamberlain and &quot;The Times&quot;. Under Winston Churchill, Cooper served as Minister of Information, Resident Minister at Singapore, Representative to the French Committee of Liberation, and Ambassador to France. He recounts the fractious relations between Churchill and General de Gaulle, in which the latter is depicted with what a reviewer calls &quot;admiration and respect, and at times with affectionate exasperation&quot;. 

&quot;Old Men Forget&quot; was well received by reviewers. &quot;The Times&quot; said, &quot;at times he can stir the reader deeply with his account of human sorrow or success. With all this he succeeds, not indeed in writing one of the greatest autobiographies, but at least in writing one where the many good things are a delight and which is always full of interest.&quot; In &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Roger Fulford wrote, &quot;The gifts of understanding and of style, which distinguish this book, lift it above the serried ranks of recollections and memoirs into the realm of literature. Harold Nicolson in &quot;The Observer&quot; called the book &quot;an autobiography which, in its perfect balance between the objective and the subjective … furnishes an example of the way in which this sort of thing should be done.&quot;

The book was reissued by Faber &amp; Faber in 2011.

<text>An in-camera effect is any visual effect in a film or video that is created solely by using techniques in and on the camera and/or its parts. The in-camera effect is defined by the fact that the effect exists on the original camera negative or video recording before it is sent to a lab or modified. Effects that modify the original negative at the lab, such as skip bleach or flashing, are not included. Some examples of in-camera effects include the following: 

* Matte painting
* Schüfftan process
* Forced perspective
* Dolly zoom
* Lens flares
* Lighting effects
* Filtration such as using a fog filter to simulate fog, or a grad filter to simulate sunset.
* Shutter effects.
* Time-lapse, slow motion, fast motion, and speed ramping.
* Bipacks
* Slit-scan
* Infrared photography
* Reverse motion
* Front projection
* Rear projection
* Phonotrope a live animation technique that uses the frame-rate of a camera

There are many ways one could use the in-camera effect. The in-camera effect is something that often goes unnoticed but can play a critical part in a scene or plot. A popular example of this type of effect is seen in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, in which the camera is shaken to give the impression of motion happening on the scene. Another simple example could be using a wine glass to give the effect that &quot;ghosting, flares, and refractions&quot; from DIY photography.

<doc id="342635" wikidata="Q6292115" url="?curid=342635" title="Terminus (Doctor Who)">
<text>Terminus is the fourth serial of the 20th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was originally broadcast in four twice-weekly parts on BBC1 from 15 to 23 February 1983.

In the serial, the alien time traveller the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) attempts to stop the fuel from a plague spaceship called Terminus from exploding and causing the destruction of the universe.

&quot;Terminus&quot; is the second of three loosely connected serials where the Black Guardian (Valentine Dyall) attempts to compel the alien Vislor Turlough (Mark Strickson) to kill the Doctor. It marks the final regular appearance of Sarah Sutton as companion Nyssa.

==Plot==
Under the Black Guardian&#x27;s instructions, Turlough sabotages the TARDIS, causing parts of it to dissolve. As the field of instability threatens to engulf Nyssa&#x27;s room, a door appears behind her and the Fifth Doctor tells her to go through it. The TARDIS, to save itself, has merged with a spaceship heading for an unknown destination. The Doctor and Nyssa, while exploring the ship, encounter two raiders, Kari and Olvir, who are intent on plundering the ship&#x27;s cargo.

When the raiders&#x27; ship abandons Kari and Olvir, it becomes apparent that the spaceship is actually a transport carrying Lazars, sufferers of a leprosy-like disease, to a space station named Terminus. The station is owned by Terminus, Inc., which claims that a cure exists there, but no-one has returned from it. Nyssa, separated from the Doctor, is infected by the disease and ushered away with the rest of the Lazars. Terminus is manned by the Vanir, guards clad in ornate radiation armor. They are slave labour, kept alive only by regular doses of a drug called &quot;hydromel&quot;, which is supplied by the corporation.

The Doctor discovers that Terminus is at the centre of the known universe and finds this information unsettling. Nyssa, meanwhile, is given over to the Garm, a giant dog-like biped, who takes her to a chamber and exposes her to radiation. The Doctor and Kari find the control room of Terminus and he realises that Terminus is also a time ship. In some unspecified past, the fuel that powered it became unstable and the now dead pilot had tried to jettison it while still in the time vortex. The tank exploded, and the outrush of energy started &quot;Event One&quot; – the Big Bang – and hurled Terminus billions of years into the future. There is still one tank of unstable fuel left, and the computer has begun a countdown to jettison that too. However, where the first explosion created the universe, the second will undoubtedly destroy it.

Nyssa awakes to find out that she is no longer infected. The radiation cure works, but it is haphazard, with as many people dying from it as recovering. The Garm knows this, but is unable to refine it as he is controlled by the Vanir. Enlisting the Garm&#x27;s help, the Doctor staves off the countdown long enough to disable the computer and cut the engine control wires. In return, the Doctor destroys the electronic control box, setting the Garm free.

Nyssa strikes a bargain with the Vanir – in exchange for synthesising hydromel and freeing them from the corporation&#x27;s influence, they will turn Terminus from a leper colony into a true hospital, and with the Garm&#x27;s help refine the radiation cure. Deciding that her scientific skills are needed more on Terminus, Nyssa elects to stay behind, bidding her friends a tearful farewell. As Tegan and the Doctor return to the TARDIS, the Black Guardian tells Turlough that this is his last chance to kill the Doctor.

==Production==

The production of &quot;Terminus&quot; was fraught with technical difficulties, including problems with costumes, delays due to electrical problems, and a mis-built set. The result was that some scenes had to be recorded on improperly-lit sets, production ran seriously late, and several scenes were taped hastily, much to Davison&#x27;s frustration. Stephen Gallagher originally wanted to call Kari &quot;Yoni&quot; until Eric Saward pointed out that it was the Sanskrit word for the female reproductive organ.

In this serial Nyssa drops her skirt in part two and remains in a slip for the remainder of the story. According to the script she was feeling ill and trying to loosen the pressure on her stomach, but this is not clear on screen. In a 1988 interview for the book &quot;Doctor Who: 25 Glorious Years,&quot; Sarah Sutton, who played Nyssa, suggests it was deliberate fan service:

&#x27;I still smile when I remember how the Production Office kept getting letters of complaint about Nyssa being too covered up. So that&#x27;s why when I left the series in &quot;Terminus&quot; I decided to drop my skirt as a parting gesture to all those fans who had written in.

&#x27;Mind you, it caused such a stir at the time, and as I&#x27;m still being asked about it when I am interviewed, I&#x27;m not sure it was a wise thing to have done!&#x27;
In an interview for season 20&#x27;s 2023 Blu-ray release, interviewer Matthew Sweet informed Sutton of the claim that she devised the moment, attributing it to Wikipedia, which she denied. She also expressed regret that she had not spoken up against it at the time.

===Cast notes===
Liza Goddard, who plays Kari, is the former wife of Sixth Doctor actor Colin Baker.

According to the extensive production documentation released from the archive as part of the &quot;Season 20 - The Collection Box Set&quot; in September 2023, director Mary Ridge offered the part of Kari to Twiggy and the part of Eirik to Robin Ellis, writing to both their agents inviting them to play the roles. The documentation does not include a response or reasons why they turned down the roles.

<text>WNET (channel 13), branded Thirteen (stylized as THIRTEEN), is a primary PBS member television station licensed to Newark, New Jersey, United States, serving the New York City area. Owned by The WNET Group (formerly known as the Educational Broadcasting Corporation and later as WNET.org), it is a sister station to the area&#x27;s secondary PBS member, Garden City, New York–licensed WLIW (channel 21), and two class A stations: WMBQ-CD (channel 46), and WNDT-CD (channel 14, which shares spectrum with WNET). The WNET Group also operates New Jersey&#x27;s PBS state network NJ PBS, and the website NJ Spotlight through an outsourcing agreement.

WNET and WLIW share studios at One Worldwide Plaza in Midtown Manhattan with an auxiliary street-level studio in the Lincoln Center complex on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side; WNET&#x27;s transmitter is located at One World Trade Center.

==History==
===Independent station (1948–1962)===
WNET commenced broadcasting on May 15, 1948, from a transmitter located atop First Mountain in West Orange, New Jersey, as WATV, a commercial television station owned by Atlantic Television, a subsidiary of Bremer Broadcasting Corporation. Frank V. Bremer, the CEO, also owned two North Jersey radio stations, WAAT (970 AM) and WAAT-FM (94.7 MHz). The three stations were based in the Mosque Theatre at 1020 Broad Street in Newark. WATV was the first of three new stations in the New York City television market to sign on the air during 1948, and was also the first independent station. One unusual daytime program, &quot;Daywatch,&quot; consisted of a camera focused on a teletypewriter printing wire service news stories, interspersed with cutaways to mechanical toys against a light music soundtrack. Another early series by the station was &quot;Stairway to Stardom&quot; (1950–1951), one of the first TV series with an African-American host. WATV&#x27;s transmitter was moved to the Empire State Building in November 1953.

On October 6, 1957, Bremer Broadcasting announced it had sold its stations for $3.5 million to National Telefilm Associates (NTA), an early distributor of motion pictures for television, joining its NTA Film Network. On May 7, 1958, channel 13&#x27;s call sign was changed to WNTA-TV to reflect the new ownership; the radio stations also adopted these call letters. NTA&#x27;s cash resources enabled WNTA to produce a schedule of programming with greater emphasis on the people and events of New Jersey, compared to the other commercial television stations. NTA also sought to make channel 13 the center of a new commercial network, though during its run the NTA Film Network offered only one night of &quot;in-pattern&quot; network programming, Friday nights in 1957–58, and for most purposes WNTA served as the New York showcase for nationally syndicated programming and produced several such entries, notably the anthology drama series &quot;Play of the Week&quot;; the talk show &quot;Open End&quot;, hosted by David Susskind; children&#x27;s show &quot;The Magic Clown&quot;; and a popular dance program emceed by Clay Cole. The station continued to lag behind New York&#x27;s other independent stations—WNEW-TV (channel 5), WOR-TV (channel 9) and WPIX (channel 11)—in terms of audience size, and NTA incurred a large debt load. National Telefilm Associates put the WNTA stations up for sale in February 1961.

====Transition (1961–1962)====
At least three prospective purchasers expressed interest in WNTA. The most prominent was the New York City-based group Educational Television for the Metropolitan Area (ETMA), a consortium of businesspeople, cultural leaders and educators who intended to turn channel 13 into New York City&#x27;s educational station. By this time, it was obvious that the non-commercial frequency that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) originally allocated to the city, UHF channel 25, would not be nearly adequate enough to cover a market that stretched from Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the north to Ocean County, New Jersey, in the south. Prior to 1964, when the FCC required television manufacturers to include UHF tuners in newer sets as per the All-Channel Receiver Act passed in 1961, most viewers could not view UHF stations except with an expensive converter; only a few manufacturers made sets with built-in UHF tuning. Even for those who could access UHF stations, reception was marginal even under the best conditions.

With assistance from the University of the State of New York, ETMA had attempted to purchase channel 13 and convert it into a non-commercial station in 1957, when Bremer Broadcasting first put the station on the block; this bid was later withdrawn. This time ETMA was competing with NTA founding president Ely Landau, who had formed a syndicate to buy the station after resigning from NTA; and David Susskind, who received financial backing from Paramount Pictures.

ETMA&#x27;s initial bid of $4 million was rejected by NTA, but the citizens&#x27; group remained persistent. With the support and guidance of National Educational Television (NET), ETMA later received an endorsement from newly appointed FCC chairman Newton N. Minow, who established public hearings to discuss the fate of channel 13. The pendulum quickly shifted in favor of channel 13 going non-commercial, and the commercial suitors withdrew their interest.

On June 29, 1961, ETMA agreed to purchase WNTA for $6.2 million. About $2 million of that amount came from five of the city&#x27;s six remaining commercial VHF stations (WPIX was the lone holdout), all of whom were pleased to see a competitor eliminated. In addition, CBS later donated a facility in Manhattan to ETMA and NET to use as a studio. The FCC approved the transfer in October, and converted channel 13&#x27;s commercial license to non-commercial.

The outgoing New Jersey governor, Robert B. Meyner, addressing state lawmakers&#x27; concerns over continued programming specific to New Jersey, and fearing the FCC would move the channel 13 allocation to New York City, petitioned the United States courts of appeals on September 6, 1961, to block the sale of WNTA-TV. The court ruled in the state&#x27;s favor two months later.

The unsettled deal almost caused National Telefilm Associates to reconsider its decision to sell the station altogether, and NTA made plans to go forward: WNTA-TV made a play to acquire broadcast rights for the New York Mets baseball team for its inaugural 1962 season. Faced with either consummating the transaction or seeing it canceled, ETMA settled their differences with New Jersey officials on December 4, 1961. After a few last-minute issues arose to cause further delays, the transfer became final on December 22. Later that evening, WNTA-TV signed off for the final time. ETMA and NET then went to work converting the station, which they said would return with its new educational format within three months.
Ten months later, channel 13 was ready to be reborn under new call letters, WNDT (for &quot;New Dimensions in Television&quot;). With Edward R. Murrow—then director of the United States Information Agency—as host of the maiden broadcast, ETMA—now the Educational Broadcasting Corporation—flipped the switch on September 16, 1962. The return of channel 13 as WNDT gave the New York City market its first educational station, and with a dial position on the coveted VHF band (in many other cities, including large ones, educational stations had to make do with UHF frequencies). New York&#x27;s non-commercial UHF channel, on the other hand, signed on as WNYE-TV four-and-a-half years later in April 1967. Richard Heffner was appointed as WNDT&#x27;s first general manager, serving in that position in its first year; Heffner continued to appear on channel 13 as producer and host of the public affairs program &quot;The Open Mind&quot; until his death in December 2013.

===Educational/public television station (1962–present)===
During the transition, and after the inaugural broadcast, WNDT faced an immediate crisis. The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) was concerned about the use of teachers—some of whom were union-certified performers—on non-commercial television, and how they would be compensated should their work be distributed nationally.

AFTRA called a strike on the morning of WNDT&#x27;s debut. Engineers and technicians who were members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) refused to cross the AFTRA picket line, leaving the station&#x27;s management and other non-union employees to produce the three-hour inaugural broadcast. Immediately afterwards, channel 13 went off the air again, as the strike continued for nearly two weeks. The striking workers returned WNDT to the air after ten days and on September 28, the labor dispute was settled. However, the station&#x27;s financial resources were drained, requiring an infusion of cash from the Ford Foundation to help keep the station running.

NET originally wanted to merge its operations with WNDT, which would have given the station a direct line of funding as well as make channel 13 NET&#x27;s flagship station. The Ford Foundation, which supported both groups, stopped the proposed mergers on at least two different occasions in 1962 and 1965.

Events that began in 1967 led the Ford Foundation to change its stance and push for a WNDT-NET merger. The newly formed Corporation for Public Broadcasting (created by an act of the United States Congress) initially supported NET&#x27;s network role, while providing government funding for programming. But that move was followed two years later by the establishment of the Public Broadcasting Service as the CPB&#x27;s own distribution system—which was a direct threat to NET&#x27;s territory. It has been intimated that the CPB&#x27;s creation was an attempt to curb NET&#x27;s production of controversial documentaries and replace it with a less controversial, government-friendly broadcaster, less hostile in particular to the Johnson, and later the Nixon administrations (NET ignored the demand and continued with the production of the critically acclaimed documentaries). At one point, President Nixon, frustrated with NET&#x27;s documentaries criticizing his administration, especially its handling of the Vietnam War, almost managed to cut NET&#x27;s $20 million funding grant in half. This led both the Ford Foundation and the CPB to threaten NET with funding withdrawal in early 1970, unless it merged its operations with WNDT. Not long after, the Ford Foundation brokered the merger of WNDT and NET, which took effect on June 29, 1970. Channel 13&#x27;s call sign was changed to the present WNET on October 1, 1970. NET ceased network operations three days later, with PBS taking over the following day. The station continued to produce some shows for the national PBS schedule with the NET branding until early 1972, when they began to be identified as &quot;WNET/13&quot; programs; a formal consolidation of the corporation&#x27;s separate national and local production facilities occurred later that year.

Following the merger, David Loxton established the TV Lab in 1972 with support from the Rockefeller Foundation and New York State Council on the Arts. TV Lab provided artists with equipment to produce video pieces through an artist-in-residence program. The Independent Documentary Fund and Video Tape Review series were both produces of TV Lab. TV Lab ended in 1984 when the CPB withdrew funds.

Since 1979, the station has been known on-air as &quot;Thirteen&quot;. It continued to include Newark in its legal IDs (though logos for national productions read &quot;New York&quot;) until the late 1990s. Since then, it has identified mostly as &quot;New York&quot;, though it is still legally licensed to Newark.

Even after becoming a noncommercial station, channel 13 retained its original studios and offices at the Mosque Theater in Newark. The station eventually moved to the Gateway Center office building, also in Newark. In 1982, more than 20 years after becoming the New York area&#x27;s flagship public television station, WNET moved its operations to the Hudson Hotel at 237 West 58th Street in Manhattan, while retaining the Gateway Center studios for a few more years.

In 1987, channel 13 celebrated its silver anniversary with a series of rebroadcasts of older programs titled &quot;Thirteen Revisited&quot;.

In 1998, WNET moved to 450 West 33rd Street, straddling the railroad tracks going into Pennsylvania Station.

Channel 13&#x27;s transmitter facilities, including a newly installed digital transmission system, were destroyed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Gerard (Rod) Coppola, channel 13&#x27;s head transmitter engineer, was among those who died when the north tower collapsed. His remains were discovered on December 25, 2001. For the next ten months, WNYE-TV, headquartered in Brooklyn, became WNET&#x27;s surrogate transmitter and airwave: for those without cable, repeats of WNET&#x27;s prime time schedule were broadcast on WNYE until Channel 13 could re-establish transmission facilities back at the Empire State Building.

Some time later, in February 2003, WNET completed its merger with Long Island PBS broadcaster WLIW (licensed to Garden City and based in Plainview), combining the two stations into one operation. While most of the two stations&#x27; operations have been merged, they still have separate studio facilities, separate governing boards, and conduct separate fundraising efforts.

During 2009, WNET&#x27;s parent company, WNET.org, sustained financial difficulties, and in January, the company pared its workforce from 500 employees to 415, due to severe problems with its budget and fundraising. In October, WNET announced that its studios at 450 West 33rd Street would soon be up for sale, as it no longer needed the extra space. In November, WNET announced that all WNET.org employees would take an unpaid furlough for three to five days between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day, with a skeleton crew of engineers remaining during that time to keep the stations on the air; however, they, too, would have to go on furloughs at the start of 2010. In 2011, WNET moved its studios and offices to Worldwide Plaza.

WNET has been broadcasting digital-only since June 12, 2009.

On July 1, 2011, WNET took over the programming of New Jersey Network&#x27;s television stations, which were relaunched as NJTV (now NJ PBS). The network features increased coverage of news and issues pertinent to New Jersey, as well as programming from the WNET and PBS libraries. The transfer of programming to WNET was part of Governor Chris Christie&#x27;s plan for the New Jersey government&#x27;s exit from public broadcasting. As part of the deal, WNET airs NJTV&#x27;s nightly statewide newscast, &quot;NJ Today&quot; (which was renamed &quot;NJTV News&quot; on November 4, 2013), to meet its local programming obligations since it still operates on a frequency allocated to Newark. Previously, it had aired NJN&#x27;s newscast, &quot;NJN News&quot;, which it co-produced with NJN from 1978 to 1981 (the program continued to air on WNET even after NJN took full control over its production).

In 2014, the Tisch WNET Studios at Lincoln Center were built at the southwest corner of 66th Street and Broadway; this facility houses two television studios. The space can also accommodate lectures, screenings and concerts. The facility is named in honor of James S. Tisch and his wife, Merryl H. Tisch, whose $15 million gift was, at that time, the single largest donation from individuals in WNET&#x27;s history.

On May 9, 2017, it was announced that WNET would resume broadcasting from Lower Manhattan at One World Trade Center by the end of the year.

In 2019, WNET acquired New Jersey news website NJ Spotlight. The following year, it merged NJ Spotlight with NJTV&#x27;s newsroom, with the NJTV newscasts becoming &quot;NJ Spotlight News&quot;. NJ Spotlight would merge with NJTV News in 2020. On March 25, 2021, WNET.org was reorganized as The WNET Group.

On July 2, 2020, at 9 a.m. during the FCC repack, WNET relocated from channel 13 to channel 12.

WNET was also one of the original co-producing entities of the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;, along with Washington, D.C. PBS member station WETA-TV and MacNeil-Lehrer Productions. The show debuted in 1975 as a local news-analysis program, &quot;The Robert MacNeil Report&quot;. Jim Lehrer, a frequent guest on MacNeil&#x27;s show, became co-host the following year, when the show was picked up by other PBS stations. WNET produced weekend editions of &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; alongside WETA-TV for the weekday editions until 2022 when WETA assumed production for the weekend edition in addition to the weekday editions.

== Criticism and controversy ==
===Misuse of federal grants===
In 2010, the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, filed a lawsuit asserting that the WNET subsidiary, the Educational Broadcasting Corporation, misused grant money worth $13 million, donated by the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts between September 2001 and January 2008. The suit asserted that WNET had used grant money that was given for the production of programs including &quot;American Masters&quot;, &quot;Great Performances&quot; and &quot;Cyberchase&quot; for other purposes. WNET settled the lawsuit in June 2010 by paying back the United States government $950,000, pledging to instate a program to ensure they honored all future federal grant requirements and agreeing to not receive $1,015,046 in federal grant money that was about to be awarded, WNET Vice President and General Counsel, Robert Feinberg, said to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;This is not a scenario we want to repeat and we have no intention of repeating it.&quot;

===Board member influence on programming===
In November 2012, WNET was scheduled to air Alex Gibney&#x27;s film &quot;Park Avenue: Money, Power and the American Dream&quot; produced by Independent Lens. The film compared the wealth gap between the New York residents of Park Avenue in the Bronx and the wealthy residents of an exclusive Manhattan apartment block at 740 Park Avenue, including David Koch, a billionaire businessman and political activist. At the time Koch was a board member of WNET and was planning on making &quot;a seven-figure donation—maybe more&quot; to WNET. A furor erupted when &quot;The New Yorker&quot; revealed in May 2013 that to appease Koch, the president of WNET, Neal Shapiro, called Koch offering him the opportunity to screen Gibney&#x27;s film before broadcast and rebut it after it aired with a written statement. Shapiro said to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that he &quot;just called David Koch. He&#x27;s on our board. He&#x27;s the biggest main character. No one else, just David Koch. Because he&#x27;s a trustee. It&#x27;s a courtesy. I can&#x27;t remember doing anything like this [before]&quot;. WNET replaced the film&#x27;s introduction by Stanley Tucci with a new introduction calling the film &quot;controversial&quot; and &quot;provocative&quot;. Immediately after the broadcast, they aired a statement from Koch Industries criticizing the film as &quot;disappointing and divisive&quot;, although a Koch spokesperson said David Koch had only watched the trailer. WNET followed the statement with an on-air round-table discussion where the moderator repeatedly mentioned that Koch&#x27;s philanthropic contributions totaled a billion dollars. Gibney was not invited to appear at the round-table and was quoted as saying, &quot;Why is WNET offering Mr. Koch special favors? And why did the station allow Koch to offer a critique of a film he hadn&#x27;t even seen? Money. Money talks. They tried to undercut the credibility of the film, and I had no opportunity to defend it.&quot; Koch did not make the large donation to WNET and resigned from their board on May 16, 2013.

===Ethical issues with funding===
In September 2013, WNET launched a series called &quot;The Pension Peril&quot;, examining the economic sustainability of public pensions and promoting cuts to their funding. On December 18, 2013, Neal Shapiro, president and CEO of WNET was quoted in a press release saying &quot;this is the type of complex public policy story that only public television covers in an in-depth and ongoing way. WNET is poised to lead and further the dialogue about this challenging situation all across public media, on PBS, public radio, and online&quot;.

On February 12, 2014 PandoDaily reported that the sole sponsor of &quot;The Pension Peril&quot; was former Enron trader John D. Arnold who had financially backed efforts to cut public employee pension benefits. Stephen Segaller, WNET&#x27;s vice president for programming told &quot;The New York Times&quot; on February 13, 2014, that he had &quot;absolute conviction&quot; that the Laura and John Arnold Foundation was an admissible funder and the funding did not violate PBS&#x27; &quot;perception&quot; rule. On February 14, Segaller told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that WNET had reversed course after discussing with PBS &quot;both the facts and the optics. We all take very, very seriously any suggestion that there&#x27;s a perception problem about the integrity of our work or the sources of our funding, and we came to the conclusion that it&#x27;s better to err on the side of caution&quot;.
WNET and PBS issued a joint statement saying the series would go on hiatus and WNET would return the $3.5 million grant it had received from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation. Segaller said in the statement, &quot;We made a mistake, pure and simple&quot;. PBS ombudsman, Michael Getler, commented that PandoDaily&#x27;s article &quot;shines a light, once again, on what seems to me to be ethical compromises in funding arrangements and lack of real transparency for viewers caused, in part, by the complicated funding demands needed to support public broadcasting, and in part by managers who make some questionable decisions&quot;.

Getler added that WNET &quot;went seriously wrong&quot; and that their &quot;decision to accept a grant of $3.5 million from the Arnold Foundation, with a stated interest in &#x27;public employee benefits reform&#x27;, flunks PBS&#x27;s own &#x27;perception test&#x27;, which is part of the service&#x27;s Funding Standards and Practices.&quot;

===Neglecting public mission and mandate===
In late 2014, WNET programming chief Stephen Segaller received widespread criticism for proposing to push the multi award-winning documentary strands &quot;Independent Lens&quot; and &quot;POV&quot; out of a prime time slot and onto a secondary station, WLIW (Channel 21). Over 2,000 documentarians signed a petition, stating that WNET&#x27;s action would lead to the shows being marginalized by PBS affiliates nationwide and have a severe effect on cutting edge documentary filmmaking. Among the prominent opponents of rescheduling &quot;POV&quot; and &quot;Independent Lens&quot; were filmmakers Alex Gibney and Laura Poitras, who had campaigned against a similar move by WNET in 2012. TV producer Norman Lear wrote an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; accusing WNET and PBS of a ratings-chase that &quot;could devastate independent documentary film making&quot;. He criticized the broadcaster for &quot;threatening, for the second time in four years, to downgrade documentaries, which are at the heart of its public mission.&quot; Many of the subjects &quot;POV&quot; and &quot;Independent Lens&quot; covered – like the Koch brothers&#x27; influence on American politics in Alex Gibney&#x27;s film, &quot;Park Avenue: Money, Power and the American Dream&quot; — have been controversial, leading the Indie Caucus, a group of Independent filmmakers to speculate if the provocative subjects they explored might also be relegating them to the more obscure TV schedule. Segaller said it was &quot;preposterous&quot; to suggest that WNET had a censorship agenda when both programs had run for more than a decade. &quot;One disputatious moment in a many-year history does not a conspiracy make,&quot; he declared. In April 2015, WNET relented and restored both strands to their original slots.

===Inaccuracy and improper influence===
In June 2015, a media furor forced WNET to postpone the third season of &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; when the Sony Pictures hack revealed via hacked emails that a subject of the series, Ben Affleck, had lobbied for material relating to a relative owning slaves be removed from the show. Those edits, which violated PBS ethics standards, brought strong criticism from the media to WNET and the producers of the show. PBS issued a statement saying &quot;the series co-producers violated PBS standards by failing to shield the creative and editorial process from improper influence, and by failing to inform PBS or WNET of Mr. Affleck&#x27;s efforts to affect program content&quot;. The statement promised the episode would be withdrawn from distribution and that the series would employ &quot;an independent genealogist to review all versions of program episodes for factual accuracy&quot;. After the suspension of the series, &quot;Adweek&quot; commented: &quot;The network clearly understands that its integrity has been thrown into question by this controversy. Even if they understood where the producers of the show were coming from when they decided to entertain the request, PBS and the veracity of all that&#x27;s included in their documentaries, requires decisive action that conveys just how serious this infraction was&quot;. The series returned to the air in January 2016.

<doc id="342637" wikidata="Q7727721" url="?curid=342637" title="The Coterie">
<text>The Coterie was a fashionable and famous set of English aristocrats and intellectuals of the 1910s, widely quoted and profiled in magazines and newspapers of the period. They also called themselves the &quot;Corrupt Coterie&quot;.

== Members ==
Its members included Lady Diana Manners, then considered a famous beauty in England; Duff Cooper, who became a Conservative politician and a diplomat; Raymond Asquith, son of the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and a famed barrister; Maurice Baring; Patrick Shaw-Stewart, a managing director of Barings Bank and war poet; Julian &amp; Billy Grenfell, Nancy Cunard and her friend Iris Tree; Edward Horner and Sir Denis Anson. Also included in the group were Hugo Francis Charteris, Lord Elcho and Yvo Alan Charteris, sons of the Earl and Countess of Wemyss of Stanway House.

Many were the children of The Souls, with Lady Diana Manners and Raymond Asquith being seen as the undisputed leaders of the group.

=== First World War ===
The First World War destroyed the original Coterie, taking the lives of Percy &quot;Perf&quot; Wyndham in 1914; Charles Lister, Julian Grenfell, Billy Grenfell, and Yvo Charteris in 1915; Edward Tennant, Hugo &quot;Ego&quot; Charteris and Raymond Asquith in 1916; and Edward Horner and Patrick Shaw-Stewart in 1917. It also destroyed the security of the group&#x27;s prewar life, and the remnants were slowly breaking around them after the war.

Lady Diana Manners was seen as a &quot;focus for all the interlocking friendships&quot;, comforting many who had lost their husbands or siblings in the War. She wrote to Patrick Shaw-Stewart about supporting Katharine Asquith after the death of her husband Raymond Asquith: &quot;I tried to sink my misery and think of holding K up as we all must.&quot;

== Activities ==
They were best known for their extravagant parties and were associated with such places as the Café Royal and The Cave of the Golden Calf, London&#x27;s first nightclub. The group made a common pledge to be &quot;unafraid of words, unshocked by drink, and unashamed of &#x27;decadence&#x27; and gambling&quot;. The group reveled in drink, blasphemy, gambling, injecting heroin, and chloroform (&quot;chlorers&quot;) sniffing. While the group&#x27;s principal purpose was the pursuit of pleasure, their default attitude was one of cynical heartlessness, that at times was downright cruel.

Reportedly, without the occasionally moderating influence of Raymond Asquith, the behaviour of the group might have been even more unacceptable and out of control, as he was fourteen years older than Lady Diana and respected by the whole group. In the early years of the group Asquith was the leader, moderating them to take pride in their learning and erudition, while enjoying wild parties and pranks. For all their wild parties, however, there was still a standard of behaviour to be upheld and all members paid for the damage that they caused. 

The members indulged in treasure hunts, fancy dress balls, and poker evenings, while holding riotous parties until dawn, with their actions documented by the press. The members were also in high demand by the great hostesses and eminent politicians of the day. Their behaviour at one such party was documented by Asquith&#x27;s stepmother who recorded that, &quot;After dinner, Diana ejaculated, &#x27;I must be unconscious tonight&#x27; and went away in a taxi to fetch chloroform from the chemist. &#x27;Jolly old chlorers!&#x27; One guest who had nearly fainted at dinner had to be removed before the orgy began.&quot;

=== World War I ===
With the outbreak of war, many members left for the Front, causing Asquith to be seen as the pre-war symbol of the Coterie, and Lady Diana Manners, becoming Lady Diana Cooper as wife of Duff Cooper, to become the post-war symbol for the &#x27;new&#x27; Coterie. She became known for throwing wilder parties, with freer sex and drink in an effort to escape the horrors of the war.

At the start of the war, Manners wrote to Edward Horner on 7 August 1914, claiming that she thought it was &quot;...up to the Coterie to stop this war.&quot;

== Reactions ==
Lady Diana Manners later wrote that she was a little ashamed of the name, and did not know how it came to be called the Coterie, just as her mother was ashamed of the title of the Souls.

Lady Diana also reported that the group&#x27;s &quot;...peak of unpopularity was certainly 1914 and 1915.&quot; This sentiment was followed by some of their parents, as Raymond Asquith&#x27;s stepmother wrote to Hilda Harrisson, calling the group &quot;...a rotten social gang...who lead a futile and devastating life.&quot; Lady Cynthia Asquith, Raymond Asquith’s sister-in-law, wrote in her diary, &quot;I don&#x27;t care a damn about their morals and manners, but I do think what – for want of a better word – I call their anti-cant, is really suicidal to happiness.&quot;

Two deaths were attributed to the group and their actions: Gustav Hamel and Sir Denis Anson. Hamel was an aviator and racing driver, who crashing his private plane into the sea during a flight from France to London on 23 May 1914. Anson drowned two months later, after diving into the Thames as a prank during a late-night boat-party. Another man, William Mitchell, died while attempting to save Anson. Mitchell had been a musician, one of the band hired to entertain the party.

<doc id="342640" wikidata="Q44700" url="?curid=342640" title="European theatre of World War II">
<text>The European theatre of World War II was one of the two main theatres of combat during World War II, taking place from September 1939 to May 1945. The Allied powers (including the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and France) fought the Axis powers (including Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy) on both sides of the continent in the Western and Eastern fronts. There was also conflict in the Scandinavian, Mediterranean and Balkan regions. It was an intense conflict that led to at least 39 million deaths and a dramatic change in the balance of power in the continent.

Throughout the mid-to-late 1930s, Adolf Hitler, the leader of fascist Nazi Germany, expanded German territory by annexing all of Austria and the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia in 1938. This was motivated in part by Germany&#x27;s racial policy that believed the country needed to expand for the pseudoscientific &quot;Aryan race&quot; to survive. They were aided by Italy, another fascist state which was led by Benito Mussolini. World War II started with Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, joined the invasion later that month. They partitioned Poland so the country was split up among the two nations. 

Poland&#x27;s allies, France and the United Kingdom, declared war on Germany days after the invasion of Poland but did not want to actually engage in conflict. This changed after Germany invaded Norway, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The six countries were taken over, and Germany began two successive aerial bombardments of the United Kingdom, in the Battle of Britain and the Blitz. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill led his country&#x27;s war effort. Germany also began a widespread genocide of Jews in the Holocaust. In 1940, Italy invaded Greece, and in 1941, Germany invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. Germany then began an invasion of the Soviet Union, breaking the countries&#x27; non-aggression pact, and Germany declared war on the United States after Imperial Japan did so. The United States was led by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

In 1942, the Soviets stopped further invasion of their country at the Battle of Stalingrad. Meanwhile, the Allies engaged in a mass bombing campaign of German industrial targets. In 1943, the Allied powers began an invasion of Italy, causing the end of Mussolini&#x27;s regime, but Germans and Italians loyal to the Axis continued fighting. The Allies liberated Rome in 1944. In June 1944, the Allied powers began an invasion of German-occupied western Europe, as the Soviets launched a massive counterattack in eastern Europe in Operation Bagration. Both campaigns were successful for the Allies. In 1945, Roosevelt died and was succeeded by Harry S. Truman. The Soviet Union conquered most of Eastern Europe including the German capital Berlin, as Mussolini was hanged and Hitler committed suicide. Concentration camps that were used in the Holocaust were liberated. Germany unconditionally surrendered on 8 May 1945, although fighting continued elsewhere in Europe until 25 May. On 5 June 1945, the Berlin Declaration, proclaiming the unconditional surrender of Germany to the four victorious powers, was signed.

The Allied powers then moved to finishing the Pacific War against Japan. Once World War II ended, the Allies occupied the continent, giving some countries back to their pre-war leaders or creating new governments, before funding their nations&#x27; economic recovery. German military leaders were subject to the Nuremberg criminal trials. Western Europe became a series of capitalist governments and eastern Europe became communist, beginning the Cold War among the former Allied nations. Germany was split into the capitalist West Germany and the communist East Germany.

==Background==
=== Axis powers ===

Germany was defeated in World War I, and the 1919 Treaty of Versailles placed punitive conditions on the country after finding Germany and the other Central Powers guilty for starting the war. These punishments included the loss of Alsace-Lorraine, the temporary loss of the Saarland, military limitations, and reparation payments to the Allied powers. The Rhineland region of Germany was also made a demilitarised zone. Germany would also join the League of Nations, an international governmental body devoted to peacekeeping. Historians are divided on whether or not the treaty was harsh or actually &quot;very restrained&quot; compared to other peace treaties at the time. Many Germans back then blamed their country&#x27;s post-war economic collapse on the treaty&#x27;s conditions and these resentments contributed to the political instability, which made it possible for Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party to come to power. This was worsened by the worldwide Great Depression, which began in 1929.

Hitler became the chancellor and fuhrer of Germany in 1933. In February 1933, the German Reichstag building caught on fire in an arson attack, giving Hitler the opportunity to blame the fire on his political opponents, especially communists. In response, the government passed the Decree of the Reich President for the Protection of the People and State, which &quot;abolished freedom of speech, assembly, privacy and the press; legalized phone tapping and interception of correspondence; and suspended the autonomy of federated states, like Bavaria&quot;. Communist politicians were arrested, leaving the Nazi Party free to do what they wanted. Hitler made Germany an absolute dictatorship, and he withdrew from the League of Nations. In 1934, during the Night of the Long Knives, Hitler ordered the purge of leaders within the Nazi Party&#x27;s &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) paramilitary organisation, believing them to have gotten too powerful.

From 1919 to 1921, Italian fascist Benito Mussolini grew a base of supporters who wanted him to deal with Italy&#x27;s political and economic crises, which involved civil conflict over the growth of socialism in the country. Many of Mussolini&#x27;s supporters became known as blackshirts, who would form a paramilitary that terrorised the Italian countryside in a campaign against socialism. In 1922, during a controversial general strike by a weakened trade unionist movement, Mussolini and his followers seized power in Rome and installed him as the Prime Minister of Italy to run the country alongside the pre-existing monarchy of King Victor Emmanuel III. Similar to Germany, Mussolini turned the country into a one-party fascist state which outlawed free speech, the free press, trade unions, and targeted socialists, Catholics, and liberals with a network of secret police and spies. Italy became sympathetic to Nazi Germany in the 1930s.

Italy, Germany, and Imperial Japan — led by Emperor Hirohito and Prime Minister Hideki Tojo — increasingly allied with each other, and during World War II they would be known as the Axis powers. Italy and Japan needed allies, as Italy was involved in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (the Italian invasion of the Ethiopian Empire) from 1935 to 1937, and Japan started the Second Sino-Japanese War (Japan&#x27;s expanded invasion of the Republic of China) in 1937, the latter of which was subsumed by World War II and ended in 1945.

In 1936, Italy and Germany made a pact of mutual assurance, the Rome-Berlin Axis agreement. Also that year, Japan and Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact to counter the perceived threat of communism from the Soviet Union led by Joseph Stalin; Italy joined the pact in 1937. Italy and Germany signed the Pact of Steel in 1939, formalising the Rome-Berlin axis. Other smaller powers joined the Axis throughout World War II. The Axis&#x27; main opponents would be the Allies, a name reused from the Allies who were the main opponent of the Central Powers in World War I.

=== Nazi social policies ===
Under the Nazi Party, Germany developed a hierarchy which considered the pseudoscientific &quot;Aryan race&quot; — white ethnic Germans or those closest genetically to them – as the most superior race, and Jews and Slavs at or near the bottom. A major part of Nazi Germany&#x27;s racial policy was the concept of &quot;lebensraum&quot;, or &quot;living space&quot;: increasing the amount of land in Europe where members of the Aryan race could live. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum writes:
This formed a key motivation of Germany&#x27;s expansion in Europe in the mid-to-late 1930s. In 1934, Germany signed a non-aggression pact with Poland, but this would not last as Poland was considered a part of the &quot;lebensraum&quot;; Nazi mythology considered eastern Europe to be lost German land. In 1933, Germany began building concentration camps to hold their political enemies and those they considered &quot;degenerates&quot;, such as people on the lower end of their racial hierarchy, the Nazi Party&#x27;s political enemies (like socialists, social democrats, and communists), Poles, Romani people, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Freemasons, disabled people, and LGBTQ people. They were brought from many places across lower continental Europe to the camps using the extensive railway network which crossed the continent. The mass killing of the camps&#x27; prisoners, which started as soon as they were built, expanded in 1941, which is usually when the start date of the Holocaust is given. In 1938, during the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; pogroms, 30,000 Jews were sent to concentration camps.

In 1938, German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman, discovered nuclear fission, or the release of large amounts energy after the &quot;nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei&quot;. German scientists of the &quot;Uranverein&quot; (uranium club) began a project to develop a bomb using nuclear fission that could destroy entire cities, the atomic bomb. This was supposed to be secret, but scientists fleeing Nazi Germany to avoid persecution made word of the program in other Western countries. In 1939, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt was warned of the program by one of these fleeing scientists, Albert Einstein.

==== German expansion and the partition of Czechoslovakia ====
The UK and France responded to Germany&#x27;s aggressive expansion through appeasement, &quot;maintain[ing] peace in Europe by making limited concessions to German demands&quot;, which was seen as reasonable by the British and French populaces because the Treaty of Versailles was thought of as indeed too restrictive, and they did not want to go to war with Germany. In 1935, Germany revoked the Treaty of Versailles&#x27; limitations on its military, and remilitizared the Rhineland in 1936. On 13 March 1938, Germany annexed Austria in the &quot;Anschluss&quot;.Hitler then threatened to go to war with Czechoslovakia, and in response, on 30 September 1938, Hitler, Mussolini, UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, and French premiere Edouard Daladier signed the Munich Agreement, which gave Germany the Sudetenland, a Czech region near its border with Germany which had long been ethnically German. Chamberlain returned to England and proclaimed that the UK had achieved &quot;Peace for our time&quot;. At the same time, Hungary annexed a part of southern Slovakia and Poland annexed the Tešin District of Czech Silesia. On 15 March 1939, Germany occupied the remaining western half of Czechoslovakia, the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia. Later that month, part of Slovakia became the independent fascist and Catholic state of the Slovak Republic under dictator and Catholic priest Jozef Tiso. The republic was controlled by the Slovak People&#x27;s Party, who made the country a client state of Germany and allowed Germany to occupy it. At the same time, the eastern part of Slovakia, the Subcarpathian Rus, was annexed by Hungary. The latter two annexations formally ended the country of Czechoslovakia, which had existed since 1918.

By early 1939, Hitler had plans of invading Poland, despite Poland having assurances from the UK and France that those countries would intervene if Poland was attacked. Germany revoked its non-aggression pact with Poland on 28 April. To ensure Germany would not face resistance from the Soviet Union during an invasion, the two countries signed an agreement to neutrality named the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact after secret negotiations from 23 to 24 August. Hitler gave the orders to invade on 26 August, certain that the UK and the Soviet Union would not retaliate. However, on the 25th, the UK and Poland publicly signed a formal treaty of military assurance, causing Hitler to delay the war for a few days. On 31 August, he gave the order to invade the next day.

== Beginning of the war in Europe (1939–1940) ==

=== Invasion of Poland (1939) ===
On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, falsely claiming that Poland was trying to encircle and partition Germany and that ethnic Germans were being persecuted there. Germany had staged an attack on one of their own radio stations the previous night and blamed it on the Poles. 1.5 million soldiers of the German military, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, took part in the invasion, and had overwhelming military superiority to Poland&#x27;s 1 million soldiers. The invasion was led by generals Fedor von Bock, Franz Halder, Georg von Küchler, Gerd von Rundstedt, Günther von Kluge, Johannes Blaskowitz, Walther von Brauchitsch, Walther von Reichenau, and Wilhelm List. Poland fought on a large front, both on the German border and with their flanks in the German territory of East Prussia in the north and German-occupied Slovakia in the south. Poland did not move their troops eastward to more defensive positions because their western half had their most vital industrial regions.

The &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; used &quot;Blitzkrieg attacks&quot;, surprise attacks with &quot;massive, concentrated forces of fast-moving [armoured] units supported by overwhelming air power&quot;. Their air force, the Luftwaffe, specifically operated as support for the Army. They quickly destroyed vital Polish infrastructure including the railways, essentially taking out the Polish Air Force before it could be used. In 1939, they surpassed the three current Allied powers in their individual numbers of infantry and armoured divisions (the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;&#x27;s armoured divisions are also known as panzer divisions). Germany also had more machine guns, mortars, antitank guns, and howitzers per division than the Allies, while having about an equal number of tanks and military aircraft to the three of them combined.

New types of military technology invented in the interwar years included radar, the dive bomber, and the aircraft carrier. The Allied countries, motivated by their victory in World War I, had generally not worked to produce significant amounts of newer weapons and military equipment afterwards, feeling confident in what they already had, while Germany did the opposite since remilitarising in 1935. Poland did not have &quot;tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and antitank and antiaircraft guns&quot;, and believed horsed cavalry could take on German mechanised forces. The UK and France did make up for Poland&#x27;s lack of air strength; Poland only had fighters and bombers, and the other Allies had those plus aircraft meant for either reconnaissance, coastal defence, or naval aviation. The UK had ready the newer Hurricane fighter and was producing the Spitfire, which began combat in 1940. France&#x27;s military aircraft, however, were outdated, and they were trying to buy newer models from the United States. The UK did not have any armoured divisions, and France&#x27;s tanks were spread thin across its infantry divisions. The Allies in 1939 were &quot;together superior in industrial resources, population, and military manpower&quot;, but German weapons, equipment, training and logistics made the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; the most powerful army in the world. &quot;Britannica&quot; writes:

The only form of combat in which Germany had inferior capability was at sea, so they did not attack the Allies&#x27; navies with massed fleets, but instead through &quot;the individual operation of German pocket battleships and commerce raiders&quot;.

France and the UK declared war on Germany on 3 September, but they did not actually engage in warfare with Germany during the invasion of Poland. Meanwhile, the Battle of the Atlantic began over control of sea routes in the Atlantic Ocean. On 17 September, the Soviets invaded Poland, and the Poles now fought on two fronts. The next day, Polish government officials escaped into Romania, and for the next ten days, the Polish garrison in the capitol of Warsaw held on as Germans bombed the city massively, killing many civilians. On the 28th, Poland surrendered, and the next day, Germany and Soviet Union partitioned the county between them in accordance with a secret provision of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The provision originally stated the western third of Poland would be given to the Germans, and the eastern two-thirds to the Soviets, while Lithuania would be put in the German sphere of influence; now, the two countries agreed to let Lithuania fall under the Soviet sphere of influence if more of Poland was given to Germany.

The last Polish unit surrendered on 6 October. The invasion ended with 14,000 Germans dead or missing and 66,000 to 70,000 Poles dead. 700,000 Poles were taken prisoner and 80,000 escaped into neutral countries. From October 1939 to March 1940, the European theatre was in a phase known as the Phoney War, when no major land operations were made by the Allied powers.

=== Winter War and Soviet occupation of the Baltics (1939–1940) ===
As early as August 1935, the Soviets&#x27; Leningrad commissar Andrei Zhdanov had started making observations of their border with Finland. Based on these observations, the Soviets began building railway spur tracks leading west toward Finnish wilderness, in particular toward Kuusamo, Suomussalmi, Kuhmo, and Lieksa. The tracks were meant for a future invasion of Finland; they could have served no other purpose than to transport troops and material, since little trade passed through these regions.

Finland and the Baltic states – Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia — were allocated to the Soviet sphere of influence in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. On 10 October 1939, the Soviets demanded the Baltic states to allow Soviet garrisons to be stationed within them. The countries felt threatened, resentfully agreeing to sign pacts of mutual assurance allowing the soldiers in. The beginning of World War II escalated tensions between Finland and the Soviet Union. The Soviets thought the Axis would use Finland as a base to attack them, and the Finns thought the Soviets were trying to expand into Finnish territory. The Soviets then forwarded demands to Finland that were similar to the demands sent to the Baltic states; the Finns also had to destroy their defensive Mannerheim Line along the Karelian Isthmus near the border with the Soviet Union. Finland rejected these demands, instead mobilising their army and unsuccessfully attempting to gain Allied support. 

On 30 November 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland, justifying it with a staged incident at the countries&#x27; border. Thus began the Winter War, with the Soviet objective being the conquest of Finland and the installation of a communist puppet government in Helsinki. At the start of the war, the Soviets suffered severe losses and made little progress. The Finns made use of the Molotov cocktail, a type of makeshift grenade, naming it after Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov who was blamed for the war. The Finns, who had little outside help, became worn down in a war of attrition.

The Soviets reduced their strategic objectives in late January 1940 and put an end to the puppet Finnish communist government, informing the opposing Finnish government that they were willing to negotiate peace. After the Soviets reorganised and adopted different tactics, they renewed their offensive in February and breached the Mannerheim Line. On 6 March, Finland asked for peace terms, and on the 12th, the two countries signed the Moscow Peace Treaty, in which the Finns ceded 9% of their territory to the Soviet Union, and the Hanko Peninsula was leased to the Soviets for 30 years. The war ended the following day.

In June 1940, Joseph Stalin sent another set of ultimatums to the Baltic states, demanding the allowance of an unlimited number of Soviet troops into their countries and to form governments under Soviet terms. All three countries were occupied by within a few months and the Soviet Union quickly began the process of Sovietization, the enforcing of communist-led people&#x27;s assemblies (&quot;soviets&quot;) which would be the new governmental bodies. The new Baltic soviets voted for their countries to become republics of the Soviet Union; the Soviet Union formally accepted these additions in August 1940.

=== Scandinavian fronts (April–June 1940) ===
On 9 April 1940, in Operation Weserübung, Germany invaded Norway and Denmark as essentially a preventative measure to stop the UK and France from occupying Norway, as well as to protect German industry; Britain previously had set up naval blockades between Norway and Germany which cut off the import of iron from northern Sweden that was being shipped out of the Norwegian port of Narvik. The invasion was led by General of the Infantry Nikolaus von Falkenhorst. Germany notified the UK and France of the invasion in a memorandum claiming that the Allies were trying to use Scandinavia as a base from which to attack Germany from the north, and that Scandinavia needed to be protected from Allied &quot;aggression&quot;. In the opening battle of the invasion, the Battle of Drøbak Sound, the Norwegians won and the German advance was slowed down. 

Norwegian resistance quickly faltered, however, and Norwegian government heads fled for the countryside. Vidkun Quisling, of the Nasjonal Samling fascist party, proclaimed a new government on the evening of 9 April 1940, and he became the Prime Minister of Norway under Germany&#x27;s administration during the war. Norway&#x27;s army agreed to cooperate with Germany, and began attacking the Allies. The UK tried to defend Norway with ground, air, and sea presence, but it was difficult. On 27 April, the British ground soldiers began to retreat. On 28 May, the British recaptured Narvik, but the Axis took it again on 9 June. The invasion was over by 10 June 1940. The British occupied the Faroe Islands in response to Germany&#x27;s gains.

Sweden was able to remain neutral.

=== Positions of Spain and Portugal ===
In 1936, insurgents led by fascist Francisco Franco went to war with the democratically elected Spanish government in the Spanish Civil War. Hitler sided with Franco, giving aid to the insurgents. In 1939, Franco won the war, becoming the dictator of Spain. Before that, though, in early 1939, many Spaniards crossed the border into France, where they were given a choice by the French government whether to return to Spain (and be punished by Franco), or join the French military; during World War II, many Spanish soldiers fought for the Third French Republic (the French government before Germany invaded) and later for the French resistance against the Nazis. Spain claimed neutrality during World War II, but collaborated with the Axis. They gave Germany raw materials to use in weapons production. 10,000 to 15,000 Spaniards that were previously refugees in France were deported to Germany, where about 60% were killed by the Nazis. Portugal claimed neutrality as well, but they allowed the British to access Portuguese bases in the Azores.

== Axis expansion (1940–1941) ==

=== German invasion of Western Europe (1940) ===

On 10 May 1940, Germany began an invasion of France and the Low Countries (the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg). Three German commanders, Willhelm von Leeb, Fedor von Bock, and Gerd von Rundstedt took control of an army each and invaded France through the northern end of its German border, and also by crossing into France through the Low Countries, the latter movement resembling the Schlieffen Plan from World War I.

On the 10th, the Germans first entered the Netherlands and Belgium, and Neville Chamberlain resigned, making Winston Churchill the prime minister of the United Kingdom. Chamberlain had been criticised for the failure of the Norwegian campaign, and Churchill had become the Labour Party&#x27;s choice for leading the nation – even if they disliked his anti-socialist beliefs – because of his willingness to fight Germany. A coalition government was formed, led by a war cabinet of Churchill, Chamberlain, the conservative Lord Halifax, and the Labour members Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood. Churchill also became the Minister of Defence. On 12 May, the Dutch Queen Wilhelmina fled with her ministers to England, where she established the Dutch government-in-exile. The next day, the Germans crossed the Meuse river, entering France.

=== British invasion of Iceland (1940) ===

Winston Churchill, meanwhile, tried to convince Iceland to join the Allies, but they wanted to stay neutral. Ultimately, the UK decided to invade, as the country was strategically important as a base to control the North Atlantic. The invasion began on 10 May 1940. The government disliked the violation of their sovereignty, but capitulated to the UK, who occupied the country. The UK promised to compensate the Icelandic population and leave at the end of the war. Canadian troops arrived in Iceland in June 1940 and the Americans arrived a year later; foreign troops continued staying in Iceland after the war, as the country became a NATO member.

=== Fall of France (1940) ===
On 14 May 1940, Dutch Commander-in-Chief Henri Winkelman surrendered his forces east of the Scheldt river, essentially all of the Netherlands. On the 15th, French general Maurice Gamelin reported to French Premier Paul Reynard that the Germans might take Paris within days. Reynard then replaced Gamelin with retired general Maxime Weygand, who was in Syria. Weygand arrived from Syria on the 19th, leaving the French high command without a top general for days while the Germans pushed towards Paris. Weygand arrived and replaced 12 generals, notably employing general Charles de Gaulle.

The Germans broke through the French line on the 15th and marched swiftly into undefended land. They reached the English Channel by the 20th, and days later, moved north towards Calais and Dunkirk. The Belgians became encircled in Flanders. On the 24th, the Germans almost reached Dunkirk, but Hitler ordered them back, giving the British Expeditionary Forces and other Allies in Dunkirk some time to evacuate to England. They moved quickly, and the situation worsened on the 27th, when Leopold III, the king of Belgium, surrendered his army. The Allies successfully evacuated by 4 June, saving 198,000 British men and 140,000 French men. At this point, the French front had been pushed back to the Somme and Aisne rivers. French numbers and morale weakened, and many retreated westward across France. On 9 June, the Germans crossed the Seine.

On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom. They began attacking France on the 20th, but it made little effect. Reynaud had fled Paris to Tours, and he and his ministers were told by Weygand on the 12th that the French battle had been lost. Meanwhile, French Major General Victor Fortune surrendered his 10,000 men of the British Expeditionary Forces&#x27; 51st Highland Division who were being exhausted at Saint-Valéry-en-Caux. On the 14th, the French military evacuated Paris and the Germans entered the city. Reynaud again moved the government, this time to Bordeaux. The next day, Verdun fell, and on the 16th, Reynaud resigned, being succeeded by Philippe Petain. On the 17th, Petain asked the Germans for an armistice. On 18 June 1940, de Gaulle asked the French people, in a speech from London, to resistance against the Germans. The terms were dictated with Hitler on the 21st, and on the 25th, war between France and Germany/Italy was officially over. On 22 June, France was divided into two sections under the Franco-German Armistice; one was occupied by the German military and the other, Vichy France, had some autonomy.

The Chasselay massacre occurred in France in June 1940.

=== Battle of Britain and the Blitz (1940) ===
Starting in June 1940, in the Battle of Britain, the German Luftwaffe air branch launched air assaults on the United Kingdom in preparation to launch an amphibious invasion of Britain codenamed Operation Sea Lion. The British Royal Air Force (RAF) successfully defended Britain, and that phase of bombing ended in September 1940. On 7 September, the Luftwaffe started an aerial bombing campaign on Britain known as the Blitz, which instead destroyed strategic targets to hurt the British war effort.

During the Battle of Britain, the UK asked the U.S. for help, but the American public was divided over the need to get involved in the war. In the November 1940 U.S. presidential election, the incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to his third term in office. America was becoming more certain of the need to send aid to the UK; for example, Roosevelt&#x27;s main opponent in the election, Wendell Willkie of the Republican Party, differed from his party&#x27;s previous sentiment by agreeing to give aid. In December 1940, president-elect Roosevelt gave a speech in which he explained his &quot;Arsenal of democracy&quot; approach to the war and justifying providing the UK with aid. In March 1941, the U.S. Congress passed the Lend-Lease Act, which allowed the U.S. to send large amounts of aid: it ranged from &quot;tanks, aircraft, ships, weapons and road building supplies to clothing, chemicals and food.&quot; The program soon expanding to giving aid to the Soviet Union, China, and allied France. 

=== Italian invasion of Greece (1940–1941) ===
On 28 October 1940, Italy began invading Greece. This surprised the Greeks, as well as Hitler, who did not want Axis troops to be taken away from the North African campaign. Mussolini was convinced that Italy would quickly win, but they were pushed back into Albania after a week. The Italians then spent the next three months in Albania defending against the Greeks. At the Battle of Taranto, the British navy destroyed almost half of the Italian fleet. In March 1941, the British sent 58,000 Commonwealth troops to help Greece, despite their intense combat in North Africa.

=== The Holocaust begins (1940–1941) ===

From 20 to 24 November 1940, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia joined the Axis powers under the Tripartite Pact. In 1941, Hitler and other Nazi Party leaders including Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich agree on a program of mass extermination of Jews throughout occupied Europe, beginning the Holocaust; this was referred to as the &quot;Final Solution&quot; to the &quot;Jewish question&quot;, or the debate over what should happen to the Jews living on the continent. On 1 March 1941, Himmler ordered the construction of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. At the same time, Bulgaria joined the Tripartite Pact, and two days later, Germany began sealing off a Jewish ghetto in Krakow, Poland. Aside from concentration camps, the Final Solution was also enacted with &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, mobile killing units. Croatia joined the Tripartite Pact on 15 June.

=== German invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece (1941) ===
On 6 April 1941, Germany, aided by Bulgarian and Hungarian forces, started invading Yugoslavia and Greece. This was to help the Italian invasion of Greece, overthrow the pro-Allied Yugoslavia government, secure the German flank during the planned invasion of Russia, protect German oil in Romania from Allied air attacks, and create a base to attack British communication lines with the east. Major Yugoslavian cities, including Belgrade, were bombed. On 17 April, Yugoslavia capitulated, as Germany moved into northern Greece. Greek cities were subject to Blitzkrieg attacks; despite intense resistance, Athens fell on 27 April. 2,500 Germans were killed. 11,000 Allied men were captured, and 45,000 evacuated to the island of Crete.

On 20 May 1941, Germany began an invasion of Crete. They launched paratrooper assaults on multiple Cretan cities, overwhelming the Allies, who evacuated the island. Germany fought off guerrilla resistance in Yugoslavia and Greece for the rest of the war. In late 1941, the Brits started aiding the Chetnik guerrillas, led by Dragoljub Mihailovic. Eventually, the Chetniks fought in a civil war against another group of guerrillas, the Partisans, led by Josip &quot;Tito&quot; Broz. The Chetniks collaborated with the Allies, and in 1943, the British switched their alliance to the Partisans. In Greece, the communist ELAS fought a civil war with the republican EDES. They fought until a peace deal was made by the Allies.

== Greatest extent of Axis power (1941–1943) ==

=== Eastern Front (June–July 1941) ===

On 22 June 1941, Germany launched the invasion of the Soviet Union, code-named Operation Barbarossa. It had originally been planned for May, but Hitler used his troops to invade Yugoslavia and Greece, which was a more pressing matter. The campaigns in southern Europe were quick, but June would end up being a less ideal date for Barbarossa, as it was closer to the brutal Russian winter. Hitler and the Nazi High Command were convinced that by October, Germany would have taken the entirety of European Russia and the Soviet regime would collapse after losing support domestically. 3 million German soldiers were involved in Barbarossa, the largest invasion force in history. The northern end of the invasion was led by Wilhelm von Leeb; the center by Fedor von Bock, Heinz Guderian, and Hermann Hoth; and the south by Gerd von Rundstedt and Paul Ludwig von Kleist.

The Soviets were taken by surprise, and had trouble creating an opposing force in time. By 27 June 1941, the Germans had reached Minsk. The local Soviets were encircled; 300,000 became prisoners, while others escaped to the east. Guderian crossed the Dnieper river on 10 July, and on the 16th, his troops entered Smolensk, taking 200,000 prisoners. Meanwhile, the Soviets used a scorched earth policy, burning many parts of western Russia. The western manufacturing industries were moved eastward. At the same time, series of storms had turned the roads to Russia into mud, and the German tanks moved slowly. However, by mid-July, the Germans had moved 640 kilometres east from their starting positions, and were 320 kilometres to Moscow. At the end of July, the Germans broke through the Soviet front in Kiev. 520,000 Soviets were encircled and captured.

=== Eastern Front (September–December 1941) ===
Operation Reinhard, named after Reinhard Heydrich, began in the autumn of 1941. It was the plan to kill the 2 million Jews living in occupied Poland. For this purpose, Germany constructed three extermination camps, Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka, and the Reich Security Main Office lead by Heydrich deported Polish Jews to these locations. By the end of the war, around 1.5 million Jews were killed in the three camps. German police and the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) also led a number of killing missions. Operation Reinhard was directed by SS general Odilo Globocnik from autumn 1941 until summer 1943. It had overlap with Aktion T4, or Germany&#x27;s program of euthanising disabled people with carbon monoxide gas.

As the Soviet Union was in a weakened position, in 1941, Finland used the opportunity to start the Continuation War, an attempt to take back the lands that they had lost during the Winter War. It would be fought until 1944. On 8 September 1941, Germany and Finland began the Siege of Leningrad, which also continued until 1944. In October 1941, at Vyazma, 600,000 of them were encircled and captured.

On 19 September 1941, the Germans entered the city of Kiev in Ukraine. Some of them were killed in explosions from mines left by retreating Soviet soldiers, and the Germans used this as a pretext to take revenge on the local Jews, whom the explosions were blamed on. From the 29th to the 30th, in the Babi Yar massacre, approximately 33,771 of Kiev&#x27;s Jews were massacred. They had been summoned to a ravine near the city, where they were made to undress and enter the ravine before being shot.

In October 1941, the Siege of Sevastopol started when Germany and Romania tried to take Sevastopol from the Soviets. Soviet resistance prolonged the siege, but the Axis took the city in July 1942. In the First Battle of Kharkov from 20 to 24 October, the German Sixth Army successfully took the city of Kharkov where the Soviets had been producing their T-34 tanks. After the city&#x27;s capture, the Germans discovered the tanks&#x27; production had been moved out of the city prior to the battle. 
As winter approached, the Germans in the Soviet Union were beaten down by cold weather; many got frostbite and had their military equipment freeze. Meanwhile, new waves of Soviets came to defend the front. On 22 November 1941, the Germans reached Rostov-na-Donu, an important location to continue the Caucasus campaign, but the Soviets launched a counteroffensive and took back the city on the 28th. On 2 December, some Germans had reached the suburbs of Moscow, but this is the closest they got to the center of the city. On 6 December, Soviet commander Georgy Zhukov started a large counteroffensive at Moscow which confirmed Barbarossa&#x27;s failure.

=== America joins the war (1941) ===
Imperial Japan declared war on the United States by attacking the American military base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on 7 December. The next day, the Japanese Ambassador Hiroshi Oshima went to German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, asking him to finally have Germany declare war on the United States. von Ribbentrop believed that the Americans entering the war would overwhelm the German war effort, but Hitler did not think so. On 11 December, Germany declared war on the United States, and the next day, Hitler defended the decision in a speech to the Reichstag. He claimed that Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies were the actual cause of World War II.

=== Operation Archery (1941) ===
On 27 December 1941, the British Army, Royal Navy, and the RAF launched Operation Archery, an attack on the Axis in the town of Vaagso in Vaagso Island, Norway. The objective was to &quot;sink, burn and destroy any enemy shipping found in the convoy assembly anchorage, and to put out of action the garrison (kill or capture) and the German installations in the port including the fish factories.&quot; Two British Commando units attacked, one to attack the German garrison in the town and the other to stop the German guns at the nearby Maaloy Island. The Army was supported by the British cruiser HMS &quot;Kenya&quot; and RAF aircraft taking off from Scotland and the Shetlands. The British sunk eight German ships and 120 Germans were killed before the British quickly retreated. The tactics of the operation would be used the Allies during the later Normandy landings.

=== Western Front (February–May 1942) ===

On 12 February 1942, in Operation Cerberus or the Channel Dash, three of the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s biggest ships (the &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, and &quot;Sharnhorst&quot;) attempted to move from Brest, France — a vital German naval port — to the German coast in the North Sea through the English Channel&#x27;s slim Dover Strait, despite the presence of the Royal Navy and RAF Coastal Command there. Once at Germany, they were supposed to be used for defending Norway. As part of the pre-existing Operation Fuller, launched in 1941 to defend the channel, the British responded with naval and air power; the Luftwaffe defended the Germans. The British destroyed some German aircraft, but the Royal Navy and RAF faced heavy losses and were unable to prevent the ships from reaching their destination. The ships&#x27; later use was limited, however.

On 28 March 1942, in Operation Chariot or the St Nazaire Raid, the Royal Navy attacked the German dry dock at St Nazaire in occupied France. The dock served as one of the bases of operation for German u-boats, and was defended by 6,000 soldiers. If it was destroyed, then the powerful German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; — which had been defending Norway – could not be repaired at St Nazaire during potential future involvement in the Battle of the Atlantic, instead having to take trips to two other docks, during which the British could attack her easier. Operation Chariot used 611 British soldiers, first destroying the gate to the dock with the HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot;, then attacking the ships. The British faced heavy losses, with 169 of them killed and 200 taken prisoner, but they greatly hurt the German navy, forcing Germany to divert troops from elsewhere to defend their Atlantic operations.

On the night of 30–31 May 1942, the RAF Bomber Command performed Operation Millennium. 1,047 bombers - the command&#x27;s first raid involving more than 1,000 bombers – led by the Commander-in-Chief of the Bomber Command, Arthur Harris, launched a raid on Cologne, Germany. This used 2 1/2 times more pilots than any previous night raid, and was important for publicity and psychological warfare. Harris gathered large amounts of spare aircraft, and had some of them used by those who were still in pilot training. The raid was a success, starting more than 2,500 fires, destroying around 13,000 buildings, and killing less than 500 people. 41 RAF aircraft were lost. The operation&#x27;s tactics were implemented by the Bomber Command for future use during the war. 135,000 to 150,000 of the city&#x27;s previous population of around 700,000 fled.

=== German and American atomic bomb programs (1942–1945) ===
In summer 1942, the U.S. began the Manhattan Project, or their top-secret atomic bomb program in response to Germany&#x27;s own program. The Manhattan Project was led by physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, and was worked on mainly in Hanford, Washington; Los Alamos, New Mexico; and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The U.S. overestimated Germany&#x27;s program, which was cancelled as a military project in July 1942 and continued as a civilian project; it became disorganised as its Jewish scientists continued to escape Nazism, and was underfunded as Hitler did not understand its purpose.

In 1944, as Berlin was increasingly bombed, Germany&#x27;s program moved from Berlin to Haigerloch. There, scientists unsuccessfully attempted to build a nuclear reactor instead of a nuclear bomb; as Germany weakened, the program shut down. 

=== Eastern Front (April 1942 – March 1943) ===
In 1942, Reinard Heydrich was assassinated by Czech agents while in Prague. On 27 May, he was travelling through the city in an open vehicle; he did not give himself appropriate security, as he was convinced of the efficacy of his anti-resistance campaign within German-occupied Europe. His car went through a usual route taken to get to the nearby airport, where he would fly back to Hitler&#x27;s headquarters. Along the way, Free Czech parachute agents (who had been trained in Britain) rolled a hand grenade under the vehicle. Heydrich was not immediately killed, but his leg and back were hit with grenade splinters, causing an infection which killed him on 4 June 1942. On 9 June, the day of his funeral in Berlin, Hitler announced attacks targeting Czechs in retaliation, and the towns of Lidice and Ležáky were destroyed.

In the Second Battle of Kharkov from 12 to 28 May 1942, Soviet marshal Semyon Timoshenko attempted to recapture Kharkov from the Germans. 170,000 Soviets were killed and 106,000 wounded as they faced major resistance from Fedor von Bock, but the Soviets retook the city after it had been mostly destroyed.

Meanwhile, Germany wanted to capture Stalingrad to cut the Soviet&#x27;s transportation hub with southern Russia, which would let the Germans take the Caucasus region and its oil fields. It would also be a symbolic victory to capture the city that included Joseph Stalin&#x27;s name. On 5 April 1942, Hitler confirmed Case Blue, which planned to destroy the Soviet forces in the south, and then afterwards, go north to take Moscow or finish taking the Caucasus. On 28 June, Fedor von Bock&#x27;s Army Group South began the operation. On 9 July, Hitler amended Operation Blue to involve the taking of Stalingrad and the Caucasus at the same time. Army Group South would be split into Army Group A, led south by Wilhelm List, and Army Group B, led to Stalingrad by Bock. Days later, Bock was replaced by Maximilian von Weichs. The Soviets had faced encirclement until Army Group B split, allowing them to retreat eastwards.
Army Group A captured Rostov-na-Donu and went into the Caucasus in Operation Edelweiss. Army Group B&#x27;s advance was Operation Fischreiher. Hitler then reassigned the 4th Panzer Army in Army Group B to help out Army Group A. Stalin and the Soviet high command formed the Stalingrad Front of multiple armies: the 21st, 62nd, 63rd, and 64th Armies, as well as the 8th Air Army. He ordered them on 28 July to take &quot;Not One Step Back&quot; and defend Stalingrad. He disallowed the evacuation of civilians from the city, for the purpose of motivating soldiers who would be defending civilians. Hitler then moved the 4th Panzer Army to move north and attack Stalingrad from the south. On the way there, the 4th Panzer Army converged with the 6th Army.On 23 August 1942, the Battle of Stalingrad began, as a German spearhead attacked the city from the north and the Luftwaffe began bombing. The fighting was some of the most intense of World War II, as the Soviets and Germans fought over blocks and buildings. The Germans pushed the Soviets through the city until they only occupied a strip of the city near the Volga river 15 kilometres long and 3 to 5 kilometres wide. The Soviets on the other side of the river took supply crossings into the city. On 14 October, the Germans fired on a supply crossing, greatly hurting the Soviets. As winter came, the Germans faced heavy losses and fatigue.
From 19 to 23 November 1942, the Soviets launched Operation Uranus, a large counteroffensive formulated by Zhukov, Aleksandr Vasilevsky, and Nikolai Voronov. It attacked the weak and undefended flanks of the 4th Panzer Army and 6th Army, greatly surprising the Germans. The German high command asked Hitler to allow the 6th Army, which was fighting near the Volga, to join the rest of the German forces in the west of the city, but Hitler ordered the leader of the 6th Army, Freidrich Paulus, to stay at the Volga. The Luftwaffe made minor deliveries of supplies to the 6th Army.

In mid-December 1942, Hitler began Operation Winter Storm, forming a special army corps led by Erich von Manstein which would help the 6th Army. The operation failed, and Hitler told the troops to fight to the death. On 10 January 1943, the Soviets began Operation Koltso, which surrounded the 6th Army. On 31 January, Paulus disobeyed Hitler by surrendering, and soon, 22 generals surrendered with him. By 2 February, the remaining 91,000 German men had surrendered. There were more than 800,000 Axis casualties, 1.1 million Soviet casualties, and 40,000 civilian casualties. Many of the surrendering Germans were put in Soviet prison camps. In the Third Battle of Kharkov from 18 February to 20 March 1943, Erich von Manstein recaptured Kharkov despite being outnumbered by the Soviets 7-to-1.

=== Dieppe Raid (1942) ===
Operation Jubilee or the Dieppe Raid was the first time American troops fought on French soil in the war. It was a commando raid on Dieppe, France, that was supposed to be significantly more destructive than previous raids. 5,000 British, American, and Canadian engaged in paratrooper landings and amphibious attacks on the fortified port of Dieppe in a move designed to divert German attention away from the Eastern Front at Stalin&#x27;s request. Launched on 19 August 1942, the raid was a disaster for the Allies, as half of their force was killed.

=== Planning the invasion of Italy (1943) ===

Roosevelt, Churchill, de Gaulle, and French general Henri Giraud attended the Casablanca Conference in Casablanca, French Morocco from 14 to 24 January 1943. The conference, with the knowledge that the North African campaign would be over soon, heavily focused on the idea of opening a front against the Axis to relieve the pressure on the Soviets on the Eastern Front. The leaders debated invading occupied France or Italy first, and they decided to invade Italy later that year and invade France in 1944.

As the Allies prepared for the invasion, they formulated Operation Mincemeant; they wanted to take Axis attention off the island of Sicily, which would be invaded first. British intelligence took the body of a homeless worker who died of ingesting rat poison, and disguised him as a Major in the British Royal Marines named &quot;William Martin&quot;, fitting him with various documentation that established the fake identity. On 30 April, the British submarine &quot;HMS Seraph&quot; dropped his body off the coast of Spain, intending for him to be discovered by the Axis, who would find a note on his person that mentioned the Allies were planning to invade Greece and the island of Sardinia, launching a small attack on Sicily as a feint. The mission was successful, as German intelligence officers in Spain found the body and directed false intelligence to higher Axis authorities, who built up troops in Greece and Sardinia.

== Allied resurgence (1943–1945) ==

=== Allied bombings in Germany (1943) ===
In 1943, the Allies attacked three dams in the German Ruhr region (a valley and industrial center): the Eder, Möhne, and Sorpe dams. This was essential, as they secured the water supply for the region and generated electricity. The plan originated in 1937, but the technology for it was not yet invented; the dams were protected by anti-aircraft guns and the presence of torpedo nets in the waters below. In 1942, the British invented the &quot;bouncing bomb&quot;, which could skip along the surface of the water instead of getting caught in the nets. On the night of 16–17 May 1943, in Operation Chastise, the RAF successfully bombed the dams. 53 of the 133 British air crew were killed, and around 1,300 people on land were killed by flooding. It provided a morale boost to the British.

The German city of Hamburg was a key location in the German war effort, functioning as a manufacturing plant for u-boats, a shipyard to store them, as well as a transportation hub for occupied Europe. Arthur Harris identified this as a target for an Allied air attack in summer 1943. He planned a 10-day bombing raid named Operation Gomorrah. It was scheduled to start on 22 July, but was delayed until the 24th. The Brits and Americans dropped a significant amount of bombs over a few days, and dropped bits of tin foil from their planes to confuse the Luftwaffe radar systems. A second raid was launched on the 27th, a third on the 29th and 30th, and the final raid on 2 to 3 August. Operation Gomorrah greatly demoralised the Germans; German Armaments Minister Albert Speer wrote: &quot;Hamburg... put the fear of god in me.” The city quickly rebuilt, however, producing 80% of its original output within five months.

By fall 1943, General Hap Arnold of the U.S. Air Force had grown disappointed with the U.S.&#x27; Eighth Air Force, which had been bombing German targets since January but faced heavy losses in the process. In August, U.S. air planners formed an operation to respond to Arnold&#x27;s belief that the Eighth exemplified perceptions of air power being ineffective amidst the wider war. In the Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission, the 1st and 3rd Air Divisions of the Eighth were to destroy many German ball bearing factories in Schweinfurt, Germany, as well as a factory for Messerschmitt aircraft in Regensburg, Germany, at the same time. It was planned for the 7th but delayed to the 17th. The targets were hit, and German manufacturing was damaged in the short-term, but the Eighth still suffered many losses and did not go on unescorted night raids into Germany for months afterwards.

The Allies launched a bombing raid of Bremen on 8 October 1943, followed by Marienburg on the 9th and Munster on the 10th.

On 14 October, German ball bearing factories were attacked again in the Second Schweinfurt raid.

=== Italian campaign (May–August 1943) ===
In May 1943, the Allies won the North African campaign, and captured many Axis soldiers and military equipment. On 20 May, the invasion of Italy began. From 20 May to 13 June, they took the islands of Pantelleria, Lampedusa, and Linosa. On 9 July 1943, the Allies began an invasion of Sicily in Operation Husky. The Allies faced little resistance while establishing beachheads, and was able to take the rest of the island partially due to their frequent resupplying of soldiers to the front.

On the night of 24–25 July, Mussolini told the Italian Fascist Grand Council that Germany was considering evacuating southern Italy. The Council voted for a resolution against him, who resigned. King Victor Emmanuel III ordered Mussolini to be arrested and for a new government to be formed by Marshal Petro Badoglio. On 17 August, the Allies finished the conquest of Sicily. There were 23,000 Allied casualties and 165,000 Axis casualties, 30,000 of them Germans.

=== Eastern Front (July–November 1943) ===

On 5 July 1943, the Germans began Operation Citadel, an assault on a bulge in the Soviet salient around the city of Kursk. The bulge went 100 miles west towards the German lines. 900,000 German troops attacked from the north and south, beginning the Battle of Kursk. It was the largest tank battle in history, involving 6,000 tanks among both sides. The Soviets had predicted the attack, and moved their main forces out of the area. They had also placed minefields and antitank defences, which costed the Germans. On the 9th, the Allies began invading Sicily, and Hitler had to move troops there from the Eastern Front. Meanwhile, the Soviets began a buildup of forces, and on 12 July, they counterattacked. The Soviets&#x27; better numbers allowed them to make a larger offensive; they took back Orel on 5 August and Kharkov on 23 August. There were 800,000 Soviet casualties and 200,000 German casualties.

In spring and summer 1943, the Jews in the Warsaw and Bialystok ghettos engaged in armed resistance against the Germans. The same happened at the Treblinka extermination camp on 2 August and the Sobibor extermination camp on 14 October. In retaliation, in autumn 1943, Heinrich Himmler began Operation Harvest Festival, the killing of the 45,000 Jewish prisoners that remained in forced labour in the Lublin District of occupied Poland. The operation began on 3 November, and Jews were killed at the Madjanek, Poniatowa, and Trawniki work camps within days. 42,000 of them ended up being killed in the Germany&#x27;s largest massacre in the Holocaust.

From 3 to 23 August 1943, in the Fourth Battle of Kharkov, the final battle in the city, the Soviets attempted to once again capture Kharkov. von Mainstein was urged by Hitler not to give up the city, but von Manstein retreated back across the Dnieper River. 50,000 Soviets and 9,000 Germans were killed.

=== Italian campaign (September–October 1943) ===
On 2 September 1943, the Allies made a small landing at the Apulia peninsula in Italy, which surprised the Germans. This front led to the Allies capturing the ports of Brindisi and Taranto, but they did not have the resources to continue north for two weeks. On 3 September, the British crossed the Strait of Messina between Sicily and mainland Italy. Little progress was made on this front as well, because of a poor road network which stopped larger Allied mobilisation. At the same time, the new Italian government began secretly collaborating with the Allies. &quot;Britannica&quot; writes: &quot;It was understood [by the new government] that Italy would be treated with leniency in direct proportion to the part that it would take, as soon as possible, in the war against Germany.&quot; The government surrendered to the Allies on the 8th, yet Germans and Italians remaining loyal to the Axis fought with the Allies in Italy over the next two years.

On 9 September 1943, the Allied Fifth Army, led by U.S. General Mark W. Clark and made up of 55,000 Americans and Brits, landed at Salerno, south of the city of Naples. They were later supported by 115,000 more troops. For a week, they faced the German 16th Panzer Division led by Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, who were outnumbered but gave more resistance than expected because they had been preparing since the resignation of Mussolini. By this time, the Allies landed at Bari, north of Brindisi, and captured Foggia without opposition; this group now faced the rear of the Germans in Naples. The Germans thus retreated and on 1 October, the Allies entered the city. Kesselring&#x27;s forces then solidified a new hold on northern Italy, and the Germans made the &quot;Gustav Line&quot; of defences in a 160-kilometer (100-mile) line across Italy between the mouths of the Gargliano and Sangro rivers, notably crossing the town of Cassino. The Italian government declared war on Germany on 13 October 1943. The Nazi High Command announced it would not cede Italy to the Allies as it began a war of attrition south of Rome.

=== Battle of the North Cape (1943) ===
In December 1943, Germany became aware of two British convoys sailing above Norway through the Arctic Circle to bring supplies to the Soviet Union on their northern coast. German battleship &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and five destroyers left Altenfjord on the north coast of Norway and went north to intercept the convoys. This began the Battle of the North Cape on 25 December. On the 26th, the German destroyers were ordered to return to the coast, leaving the &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; up against a large British force. The &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was sunk and 1,927 Germans were killed, only 36 of them surviving after being rescued by the British.

=== Eastern Front (December 1943 – April 1944) ===
On 24 December 1943, Nikolai Vatutin&#x27;s Soviet forces broke out of their salient in Kiev and soon retook Zhytomyr and Korosten. Throughout 1944, the Germans on the Eastern Front faced having less troops while needing to defend the same wide frontlines. In January, the Germans&#x27; surrounding of Leningrad was weakened. On 4 January 1944, the Soviets crossed the pre-war Polish borders. Erich von Manstein&#x27;s German forces slowed Vatutin&#x27;s progress, but Germany lost many soldiers, and their defensive line across the Eastern Front was weakened. The Soviets used this to capture Lutsk in modern Ukraine on 5 February. In March, the Soviets crossed the Dnieper and Bug rivers, coming near Romania and Hungary. Hitler reinforced his troops in Hungary to stop further Soviet advance into central Europe, and to maintain his control of the Balkans. On 1 April, Zhukov attempted to break through these defences into Hungary, but was unsuccessful. Later that month, the Soviets regained the Crimea and Odessa, and German troops left Sevastopol. In May, Germany stabilised the Eastern Front, but they were &quot;unstable, both politically and militarily, under the surface.&quot;

=== Italian campaign (January–June 1944) ===

The Battle of Monte Cassino in Italy lasted from 17 January to 18 May 1944. Monte Cassino was a hill that, if captured, could be used by the Allies to break through the Gustav Line across Cassino. The hill, on whose summit lied an old Benedictine monastery, overlooked the highway to Rome which is named the A1 today. The first engagement of the wider battle was from 17 January to 11 February, where U.S. and French troops fought elite paratroops of the Luftwaffe; the Allies were pushed back. The second engagement was from 15 to 18 February and involved Allied troops from India and new Zealand. It included Operation Avenger, in which the Allies bombed the monastery. However, the ruins of the monastery ended up being a more effective defensive position for the Germans, who again pushed back an Allied assault. The third engagement from 15 to 26 March was again a loss for the Allies, mainly British and Canadians. The fourth engagement from 11 to 18 May, headed by Polish Allies. They faced intense resistance, but they took the summit of Monte Cassino on the 18th, which by then was mostly abandoned by the Germans. The wider battle led to 105,000 Allied and 80,000 German casualties.

The Battle of Anzio, the Allied amphibious landing at Anzio, Italy, was from 22 January to 5 June. The landing allowed the Allies to bypass the Gustav Line. 36,000 Allied soldiers took Anzio and then the nearby town of Nettuno, facing little resistance. They then spent time securing the beachhead, falsely assuming they need to secure their position before further advancements, when the path to Rome was generally undefended. British general Harold Alexander and American general John P. Lucas debated whether to more quickly push towards Rome, making little gains in the process. This gave time for the Axis to start a counteroffensive towards Anzio on 2 February; the offensive reached its peak on the 17th, and the Allied beachhead was reduced in size, but the Allies held on. The 135,000 German troops attacking Anzio were needed on the Eastern Front, and both fronts had fewer people than they needed. Neither side made significant gains over the next few months, but German power was reduced as some of the troops were sent south. On 23 May, the Allies broke out of the bridgehead, and the Germans retreated from the defensive line. On 4 June 1944, the Allies liberated Rome. During the Battle of the Anzio, the Allies suffered 24,000 American and 10,000 British casualties, while the Germans had 27,500 casualties.

=== Allied invasion of Western Europe (1944) ===

On 6 June 1944, American, British, Canadian, and Australian soldiers began the invasion of German-occupied western Europe, named Operation Overlord. In Operation Neptune, they invaded five different beaches in the French region of Normandy - nicknamed (from west to east) Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword - and established a beachhead. By the end of the day, the allies reached the French &quot;bocage&quot;, where they met intense German resistance.

The British 3rd Infantry Division, the first division to land on Sword Beach, was told to capture the French city of Caen, a major transportation hub. At the Battle for Caen towards the end of D-Day, two German panzer divisions and an infantry division annihilated the British. The city remained under German control for the next week. As the U.S. 1st Infantry Division made gains south of Omaha Beach, some Germans near Caen had to retreat, creating a gap in the western part of the city. In Operation Perch on 10 June, the British 7th Armoured Division moved into the gap. Major General Fritz Beyerlein, commander of the Panzer Lehr division, noticed the movement and sent troops to the village of Tilly-sur-Seulles in between the Brits and Caen to slow the advance. The British, in turn, decided to disengage from Tilly-sur-Seulles and attempt to outflank the Germans at the village of Villers-Bocage. In the Battle of Villers-Bocage, both sides took heavy losses, the British losing 217 men and the Germans losing an unknown amount; the Brits retreated. The Brits and Germans fought over Caen until August. Once the Germans lost Caen, they moved out of Villers-Bocage.

Meanwhile, in the Battle of Carentan from 10 to 14 June, the U.S. Army fought the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; over the town of Carentan. The Germans retreated, securing for the Americans the corridor between the town, Utah Beach, and Omaha Beach. The Allies were then successful in the Battle of Cherbourg, breaking into the Cotentin Peninsula.

Allied advancements disrupted the German high command. In the 20 July 1944 plot, many figures of the German high command attempted to assassinate Hitler in East Prussia; Hitler took revenge on many people in the military, and Erwin Rommel and Günther von Kluge committed suicide.

In Operation Cobra, starting on 25 July 1944, the Allies broke out of the front with Germany, and started heading toward Brittany. Hitler ordered Operation Luttich to reestablish the front, but it failed.

On 15 August, the Allies landed in the French Riviera in Operation Dragoon, starting an invasion of southern France. The next day, Hitler allowed the Germans in Normandy to retreat. As they left, they were encircled by American and British spearheads at Falaise, creating the Falaise pocket. However, many Germans broke out between 16 and 19 August. By the time the Germans left Normandy, 50,000 of theirs were dead and 200,000 were taken prisoner.

=== Eastern Front (June–November 1944) ===
On 23 June 1944, the Soviets launched a large counter-offensive, Operation Bagration, against Germany along a 450-mile front across eastern Europe. The Germans expected an offensive from the south and were surprised at the operation&#x27;s scale. The Soviets were quickly successful, killing thousands within days. After reaching Minsk on 3 July, 100,000 Germans were killed. The way to Poland and Lithuania opened up to the Soviets. Lviv and all of Byelorussia were liberated by the end of July. From 22 to 23 July, Majdanek near Lublin, Poland became the first major Nazi concentration camp was liberated by the Allies. The Soviets then liberated Lublin on the 24th. Operation Bagration ended on 19 August 1944. There were 750,000 Soviet casualties and 360,000 to 670,000 German casualties.

As the Soviets advanced towards Warsaw in July 1944, they had promised aid to the underground resistance in the city, the Home Army, and encouraged them to start an uprising against the occupying Germans. The Home Army attempted to gain control over the city before the Soviets got there. Starting on 1 August, in the Warsaw uprising, the Poles captured most of the city from a weakened German garrison. On 25 August, the Germans launched a successful and brutal counterattack. The Soviets gave aid to the Home Army on 13 September, but it was too late to significantly help them. The Home Army split into smaller units and continued the uprising, but they were forced to surrender on 2 October. The Germans deported the city&#x27;s population and razed it. The Soviets had allowed the Germans to suppress the uprising, thus causing the end of the military organisation that supported the Polish government-in-exile located in London.

The Finns defeated the Soviets at the Battle of Tali-Ihantala in late June and early July 1944. The battle likely convinced Stalin that conquering Finland was not worth the cost, and the Moscow Armistice was signed on 19 September 1944. The Finns agreed to remove all German troops from Finnish territory.

On 20 August 1944, the Romanians formed a new government which sided with the Soviets and thus allowed them to pass through. They moved into Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. Germany began to move its forces out of Yugoslavia and Greece. In October, the Allies invaded Greece, but fought little resistance. Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill then agreed that Greece would fall under the &quot;British sphere of influence&quot;. In the Yugoslavian campaign of World War II, 1.2 million died, and in the Greek campaign, 300,000 died.

On 20 October 1944, Belgrade was liberated. Meanwhile, the Soviets reached Hungary. On 4 November, they reached Budapest, which was greatly defended. A siege began which lasted for months. The Soviet occupation of Hungary gave its anti-fascist parties the possibility to continue their political activities, and as the Soviets captured Debrecen, they held a parliamentary election and formed the rivalling the Nazi-backed government in Budapest, which continued the war on the side of Germany. Hungarian volunteers participated in the fights for Budapest on the Soviet side.

=== Western Front (August–September 1944) ===

In 1944, during the invasion of France, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower at first was going to bypass Paris; however, on 19 August, the French in the city started a resistance against the remaining Germans, and the Allies headed towards the city. On 25 August, the Germans in Paris surrendered. By September, three Allied Army Groups were in line against German formations in the west. The pace of Allied gains was much quicker than the Allies themselves had estimated; by 11 September, they had reached eastward positions that were initially predicted to be reached around May 1945. There was optimism that the war in Europe might be over by the end of the year. Allied forces then reached the Siegfried Line, the German defensive line across western Europe. The Allies made minor gains in September and October, however, as Germans reinforced the front with new troops. From 17 to 24 September, in Operation Market Garden, the Allies sent three airborne divisions to seize road bridges in the Netherlands, to be held open for the British Second Army to cross. The Allies faced serious resistance on the ground, and the operation was abandoned.

The Allies then began heading towards the Roer river dams to stop the Germans from destroying them and flooding the area, which would delay the Allied advance. The fastest way to the dams was through Hurtgen Forest, which was one of the most fortified areas of the Germans. The Battle of Hurtgen Forest started on 19 September, as American troops forced their way through the forest. The advance was delayed by the events of the Battle of the Bulge. In October, in the Battle of Aachen, the U.S. Army faced one of its toughest urban battles in the city of Aachen, a German stronghold. It is located in the Aachen Gap, a stretch of flat land between the Allies&#x27; current position and the Ruhr region. The city of Aachen was one of the only major obstacles along the way. The U.S. captured the city after heavy losses.
The Battle of the Bulge was the last major German offensive of the Western Front. It was an attempt to push the western Allies away from Germany. It started on 16 December 1944. Germany&#x27;s 5th and 6th Panzer Armies advanced west through the Ardennes Forest, attempting to cross the Meuse river. This caught the allies by surprise. The battle happened amidst extremely cold weather. On 17 December 84 American prisoners of war were murdered by the Germans in the Malmedy massacre. The Germans failed to reach the Meuse or take Bastogne, which was held by Americans. On 3 January 1945, the western Allies began a counterattack, and by 16 January, the battle was over. The Allies suffered 75,000 casualties, and the Germans 120,000.

Afterwards, German forces were not resupplied to the front in great numbers. This depletion of manpower stopped any chances of German large-scale resistance to the Allied invasion. In early February, the Battle of Hurtgen Forest continued, and the Allies captured the desired dams. The battle cost 33,000 American casualties.

=== Eastern Front (January–February 1945) ===
From January 1945, Hitler remained in Berlin at the Chancellery and its bunker, cancelling a plan to lead a resistance in southern Germany as the Soviets closed in on Berlin. Meanwhile, Germany unsuccessfully attempted to take back Budapest. On 12 January, the Soviets launched the Vistula–Oder offensive, crossing the Vistula river at Sandomierz. On the 14th, the armies of Zhukov and Konstantin Rokossovsky joined the offensive, greatly expanding its size. Warsaw was isolated and liberated on the 17th. Also on the 17th, those in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp who were still healthy were told to march west into more fortified German territory.Rokossovsky then moved into East Prussia. By 26 January 1945, he reached the Baltic Sea, isolating all German forces east of Danzig. Meanwhile, Ivan Konev&#x27;s forces reached the Oder river, isolating the Germans in Upper Silesia. On the 27th, the Soviets liberated those were left behind at Auschwitz, and the Siege of Leningrad ended. Zhukov went through the corridor between the Vistula and Warta rivers and reached Brandenburg in Germany on 30 January. The Germans at this point benefited from a smaller front, meaning there was less to defend, but they were being attacked on both the western and eastern fronts. On 13 February, the Siege of Budapest ended, and the Soviets captured the city.

From 4 to 11 February 1945, Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill met at the Yalta Conference in Crimea. They created a plan for the defeat and occupation of Nazi Germany and its occupied states. They agreed to abolish or confiscate Germany&#x27;s military industry, try war criminals before an international court, and create interim governments in Eastern Europe before further questions of their governance can be settled.

== End of the war in Europe (1945) ==

=== German losses (February–April 1945) ===
On 14 February 1945, a raid on Dresden produced one of the most devastating fires in history. A firestorm was created in the city, and between 18,000 and 25,000 people were killed.

20 to 25 February is known as the &quot;Big Week&quot; because of Operation Argument, in which Allied air forces took off from southern Italy to perform a series of bombing raids on German industrial targets such as aircraft factories. It significantly weakened the Luftwaffe.

In early March 1945, Allied troops began assaults to help them cross the Rhine. This allowed them to continue the invasion of Germany and encircle German forces in the Ruhr. On 7 March, at the Battle of Remagen, the Ludendorff Bridge spanning the Rhine at Remagen was attacked by the Germans, and its foundation collapsed, but the bridge ultimately sat intact over the river. This allowed the U.S. to establish a bridgehead on the other side. All four U.S. armies in Western Europe went over the Rhine in the next few weeks; the First and Ninth Armies encircled 300,000 German soldiers in the Ruhr pocket, while the Third and Seventh Armies continued on towards central and southern Germany. German officer Walter Model dissolved the army inside the Ruhr pocket, and the 300,000 were taken as prisoners of war.

From 6 to 15 March, the Germans engaged in Operation Spring Awakening in Hungary, the last major German offensive of the war. The goal was to attain Hungary&#x27;s oil reserves (which were some of the last major reserves available to the Axis), as well as to prevent the Soviets from reaching Vienna. It was unsuccessful, and the Soviets began a counteroffensive on the 16th.

=== End of Nazi Germany (1945) ===
On 12 April 1945, Roosevelt died of a cerebral haemorrhage, and his vice-president Harry S. Truman succeeded him as U.S. president. On the 27th, as Allied forces closed in on Milan, Mussolini was captured by Italian Partisans. He was trying to flee Italy to Switzerland and was travelling with a German anti-air battalion. On 28 April, Mussolini and several of the other fascists captured with him were taken to Giulino di Mezzegra and executed by firing squad.
In April and May 1945, the Allies liberated the concentration camps of Buchenwald, Dachau, Dora-Mittelbau, Flossenburg, Mauthausen, Ravensbruck, Sachsenhausen, and Stutthof.
The Battle of Berlin began on 16 April as the Soviets encircled the city and began shelling the last pockets of resistance with large amounts of artillery. During the battle, many Soviet soldiers engaged in a mass rape of German women and girls known as the Rape of Berlin. Medical records suggest that 100,000 people were raped, but this is a greatly debated figure. This included people aged &quot;eight to 80&quot;, and those aged 15 to 55 were required to get tested for STDs. Abortion was temporarily made legal in Germany in response.

Hitler became exhausted and began to accept Germany&#x27;s inveitable failure and the idea of him committing suicide. In his last will and testament, he appointed Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as the new head of state and Joseph Goebbels as chancellor. On 30 April, Adolf Hitler, with his wife of one day, Eva Braun, committed suicide in his bunker. The German garrison commander, General Helmuth Weidling, then surrendered. Individual German troops continued fighting while the surrendered troops were captured and committed suicide. On 1 May, Joseph Goebbels and his wife committed suicide, at the same time organising the killing of their six children with poison. The Battle of Berlin ended on 2 May. It caused 100,000 Soviet casualties and an unknown number of German deaths. On 4 May, Dönitz went to British officer Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s headquarters in Hamburg and surrendered the German forces in northern Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands.

The next day, at the Battle for Castle Itter in Tirol, renegade German troops and Americans allied to stop the Waffen-SS from assaulting a stronghold filled with French politicians held as prisoner. It was the only time Germans and Americans allied during the war.

On 7 May, Eisenhower accepted Germany&#x27;s unconditional surrender of all their forces, which went into effect the next day. Norway was thus liberated. 8 May was Victory in Europe Day, and celebrations were had around the world. The Russian Federation celebrates 9 May as Victory Day. In northern Italy, anti-fascist parties formed a new national government which was led by Ferruccio Parri. On 20 May, Heinrich Himmler was captured by Russian soldiers, from there getting sent to British capture. On the 23rd, while his person was being searched, he bit down on a cyanide capsule that was hidden in his mouth, which was stored there in case of capture. On 5 June 1945, the Allies signed the Berlin Declaration, which formally took over the supreme authority of Germany, bringing about the end of Nazi Germany.

== Aftermath ==
39 million people died in the European theatre. More Soviet citizens died during World War II than those of all other European countries combined. Nazi ideology considered Slavs to be &quot;subhuman&quot; and German forces committed ethnically targeted mass murder. Civilians were rounded up and burned alive or shot in squads in many cities conquered by the Nazis. Russian government figures now estimate USSR losses within postwar borders to be at 26.6 million, including 8 to 9 million due to famine and disease. This figure includes 8 million dead Red Army troops died who faced the Axis on the Eastern Front.

At the Potsdam Conference of 17 July to 2 August 1945, the Allies formally agreed to many of the ideas considered at the Yalta Conference. Germany, Austria, and specifically Berlin and Vienna were all divided into four regions each occupied by the U.S., UK, France, and the Soviet Union. The countries used the &quot;Five Ds&quot; when governing these regions: &quot;demilitarization, denazification, democratization, decentralization, and deindustrialization.&quot; European cities such as Berlin, Prague, and Dresden, had been destroyed, and many died during the abnormally strong winter later that year. The U.S. paid billions of dollars to rebuild Europe in the Marshall Plan. 

The Cold War started as the capitalist and communist former Allied states began fighting for control over the new global order. In 1949, the American, British, and French occupied regions of Germany became the capitalist West Germany, and the Soviets&#x27; region became the communist East Germany. Both governments were under the influence of their respective former occupants.

After Germany&#x27;s concentration camps were liberated, many of their survivors lived in displaced persons camps for years. Many were afraid of antisemitism if they went back to their old homes in Europe, which drove many Jewish immigrants to the U.S.; in December 1945, the U.S. loosened immigration restrictions to receive those who were displaced by the Nazis. A lack of places that accepted Jews further motivated Zionism, an ideology promoting a Jewish state where the mostly-Arab state of Mandatory Palestine was located. The establishment of the Jewish state of Israel in 1948, which was supported by most major countries, began the Arab–Israeli conflict.

In the Nuremberg trials of 1945 to 1946, many officials of the Nazi high command were tried for war crimes, crimes against the peace, and crimes against humanity. Many were convicted and hanged. Karl Dönitz was sentenced to prison for ten years, leaving prison in 1956. He stayed in West Germany until his death in 1980. Albert Kesselring was sentenced to death in 1947, had his sentence changed to life imprisonment, and was pardoned and released in 1952, dying in West Germany in 1960. Meanwhile, Argentina&#x27;s &quot;fascist-leaning&quot; president, Juan Perón, established &quot;ratlines&quot; (escape routes) in Italian and Spanish ports to smuggle Nazi officials facing potential war crimes prosecution into Argentina, where many of them lived or from which they moved to other South American countries. In 1960, Israeli intelligence agents abducted Adolf Eichmann, a leading figure of the Holocaust, from the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was convicted of war crimes by an Israeli court in 1962 and executed. Another leading Holocaust architect, Josef Mengele, lived in multiple South American countries in the decades after the war, dying from a drowning in Brazil in 1979.

In Operation Overcast, later named Operation Paperclip, the U.S. secretly brought 1,600 German scientists and their families to work for the U.S. government, using &quot;German intellectual resources to help develop America’s arsenal of rockets and other biological and chemical weapons, and to ensure such coveted information did not fall into the hands of the Soviet Union&quot;. Harry Truman forbade the recruiting of former Nazi officials or sympathizers, but the operation&#x27;s leading organisations – the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency and the Office of Strategic Services — ignored the stipulation, &quot;eliminating or whitewashing incriminating evidence of possible war crimes from the scientists’ records&quot;.

<text>The Pacific War, sometimes called the Asia–Pacific War or the Pacific Theater, was the theater of World War II fought between the Empire of Japan and the Allies in East and South East Asia, the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and Oceania. It was geographically the largest theater of the war, including the Pacific Ocean theater, the South West Pacific theater, the Second Sino-Japanese War, and the brief Soviet–Japanese War, and included some of the largest naval battles in history. Fighting between Japan and the Republic of China had begun in 1937, with hostilities dating back to 1931 with Japan&#x27;s invasion of Manchuria, but the Pacific War is more widely accepted to have started in 1941, when the United States entered the war against Japan and Germany.

On December 7–8, 1941, Japan attacked the American military base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and invaded the U.S.-held Wake Island, Guam, and the Philippines and the British colonies of Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The Japanese achieved great success in the initial six months of the war, allying with Thailand and capturing the aforementioned territories in addition to Burma, Borneo, the Dutch East Indies, New Britain, the Solomon and Gilbert Islands, and parts of New Guinea. In May 1942, Japanese and Allied aircraft carriers fought at the Battle of Coral Sea, resulting in the retreat of an invasion force intended for Port Moresby. In June, Japan invaded the Aleutian Islands and was decisively defeated at the Battle of Midway, which is considered a key turning point in the Pacific War. After this point, the Japanese experienced great difficulty replacing their losses in ships and aircraft, while American factories and shipyards produced ever increasing numbers of both.

Major Allied offensives in the Pacific began in August 1942 with the Guadalcanal and New Guinea campaigns. These were followed by Operation Cartwheel from June 1943, which neutralized the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain by early 1944. Elsewhere, Allied forces recaptured the Aleutian Islands by August 1943, and initiated the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign in November 1943, which lasted until February 1944. In the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, the Japanese fleet took heavy damage; the Allied campaign to recapture the Philippines began in October and set off the Battle of Leyte Gulf, after which the Japanese were unable to fight further surface engagements and resorted to &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks. The rest of the war was characterized by an Allied strategy of island hopping, with invasions of the Mariana and Palau Islands, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa between June 1944 and June 1945. This enabled a blockade of the Japanese home islands and the start of a strategic air raid campaign which caused widespread urban destruction.

In China, Japan made large gains in Operation Ichi-Go between April and December 1944, while in Burma, the Japanese launched an offensive into India which was reversed by July 1944 and led to its liberation by the Allies in May 1945. From the start of the war, Allies had adopted a &quot;Europe first&quot; stance, giving priority to defeating Germany; after Germany&#x27;s surrender in May 1945, Allied forces were shifted to the Pacific in anticipation for Operation Downfall, a planned invasion of Japan. This became unnecessary after the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945 and Soviet invasion of Manchuria on 9 August, after which Japan surrendered unconditionally on 15 August and signed a surrender document on 2 September, ending World War II. Japan lost its former possessions in Asia and the Pacific, and was occupied by the Allies until 1952.

==Overview==
===Names of the war===
In Allied countries during the war, the &quot;Pacific War&quot; was not usually distinguished from World War II, or was known simply as the &quot;War against Japan&quot;. In the United States, the term &quot;Pacific theater&quot; was widely used. The US Armed Forces considered the China Burma India theater to be distinct from the Asiatic-Pacific theater during the conflict.

Japan used the name , as chosen by a cabinet decision on 10 December 1941, to refer to both the war with the Western Allies and the ongoing war in China. This name was released to the public on 12 December, with an explanation that it involved Asian nations achieving their independence from the Western powers through armed forces of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Japanese officials integrated what they called the into the Greater East Asia War. During the Occupation of Japan (1945–1952), these terms were prohibited in official documents (although their informal usage continued). The war became officially known as the . The is also used, referring to the period from the Mukden Incident of 1931 through 1945.

===Participants===
====Allies====
The major Allied participants included China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. China had already been engaged in a war against Japan since 1937. The US and its territories, including the Philippine Commonwealth, entered the war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, which prompted declarations of war on Japan by Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, as well as the Dutch government-in-exile which retained control of the Dutch East Indies. All of these were members of the Pacific War Council. From 1944 the French commando group Corps Léger d&#x27;Intervention also took part in resistance operations in Indochina. Some active pro-allied guerrillas in Asia included the Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army, the Korean Liberation Army, the Free Thai Movement, the Việt Minh, the Khmer Issarak, and the Hukbalahap.

The Soviet Union fought two short, undeclared border conflicts with Japan in 1938 and again in 1939, then remained neutral through the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact of April 1941, until August 1945 when it (and Mongolia) joined the rest of the Allies and invaded the territory of Manchukuo, China, Inner Mongolia, and the Japanese territories such as Korea and South Sakhalin (Karafuto).

Mexico provided air support in the form of the 201st Fighter Squadron and Free France sent naval support in the form of and later the .

====Axis powers and aligned states====
The Axis-aligned states which assisted Japan included the authoritarian government of Thailand. Also involved were members of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which included the Manchukuo Imperial Army and Collaborationist Chinese Army of the Japanese puppet states of Manchukuo (consisting of most of Manchuria), and the collaborationist Wang Jingwei regime (which controlled the coastal regions of China), respectively.

Japan conscripted many soldiers from its colonies of Korea and Taiwan. Collaborationist security units were also formed in Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, British Borneo, former French Indochina (after the overthrow of the French regime in 1945), as well as Timorese militia.

Germany and Italy both had limited involvement in the Pacific War. The German and the Italian navies operated submarines and raiding ships in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, notably the .

===Theaters===
Between 1942 and 1945, there were four main areas of conflict in the Pacific War: China, the Central Pacific, South-East Asia and the South West Pacific. US sources refer to two theaters within the Pacific War: the Pacific theater and the China Burma India Theater (CBI). However, these were not operational commands.

In the Pacific, the Allies divided operational control of their forces between two supreme commands, known as Pacific Ocean Areas and Southwest Pacific Area.

The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) did not integrate its units into permanent theater commands. The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA), which had already created the Kwantung Army to oversee its occupation of Manchukuo and the China Expeditionary Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War, created the Southern Expeditionary Army Group at the outset of its conquests of South East Asia. This headquarters controlled the bulk of the Japanese Army formations which opposed the Western Allies in the Pacific and South East Asia.

==Historical background==
===Conflict between China and Japan===

In 1931, without declaring war, Japan invaded Manchuria, seeking raw materials to fuel its growing industrial economy. By 1937, Japan controlled Manchuria and was prepared to move deeper into China. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident on 7 July 1937 provoked full-scale war between China and Japan. The Nationalist Party and the Chinese Communists suspended their civil war in order to form a nominal alliance against Japan, and the Soviet Union quickly lent support by providing large amounts of materiel to Chinese troops. In August 1937, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed some of his best troops to defend Shanghai against some 300,000 Japanese troops attempting to seize the city, which fell to Japan after three months of fighting. The Japanese continued to push deeper into China, capturing the capital Nanjing in mid-December 1937 and committing atrocities in the Nanjing Massacre, including rape, murder and torture.

In March 1938, Nationalist forces won their first victory at Taierzhuang, but the city of Xuzhou was taken by the Japanese in May. In June 1938, Japan deployed about 350,000 troops to invade Wuhan and captured it in October after a four-month campaign. The Japanese achieved major military victories, but world opinion—in particular in the US—was hostile to Japan&#x27;s invasion, especially after the &quot;Panay&quot; incident. In addition, the Japanese had failed to destroy the Chinese army, which continued to resist from the new Nationalist capital in Chongqing, or in the case of the Communists, Yan&#x27;an.

In 1939, Japanese forces tried to push into the Soviet Far East. They were defeated in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol by a mixed Soviet and Mongolian force led by Georgy Zhukov. This caused the Japanese to abandon attempts to expand to the north, while Soviet aid to China ceased as a result of the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact. In September 1940, Japan decided to invade French Indochina, which was controlled at the time by Vichy France. On 27 September Japan signed a military alliance with Germany and Italy, becoming one of the three main Axis Powers.

The war entered a new phase with Japanese defeats at the Battle of Suixian–Zaoyang, the 1st Battle of Changsha, the Battle of Kunlun Pass and the Battle of Zaoyi. After these victories, Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940; however, due to a lack of military-industrial capacity, they were repulsed in late March 1940. In August 1940, Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central China; in retaliation, Japan instituted the &quot;Three Alls Policy&quot; (&quot;Kill all, Burn all, Loot all&quot;) in occupied areas, killing at least 2.7 million civilians.

By 1941 the conflict had become a stalemate. Although Japan had occupied much of northern, central, and coastal China, the Nationalist Government had retreated to the interior and set up a provisional capital at Chongqing, while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in Shaanxi. Japanese offensive action against the retreating and regrouping Chinese forces was largely stalled by the mountainous terrain in southwestern China, while the Communists organized widespread guerrilla and saboteur activities in northern and eastern China behind the Japanese front line.

Japan sponsored several puppet governments, one of which was headed by Wang Jingwei. Conflicts between Chinese Communist and Nationalist forces vying for territorial control behind enemy lines culminated in a major armed clash in January 1941, effectively ending their co-operation.

Japanese strategic bombing efforts mostly targeted large Chinese cities such as Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chongqing, with around 5,000 raids from February 1938 to August 1943. Japan&#x27;s strategic bombing campaigns killed between 260,000 and 350,934 non-combatants.

===Tensions between Japan and the West===
As early as 1935, Japanese military strategists had concluded that the Dutch East Indies were, due to their abundant oil reserves, crucially important for further expansion by the Japanese Empire. By 1940 the Japanese also included Indochina, Malaya, and the Philippines within their concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Japanese troop build-ups in Hainan, Taiwan, and Haiphong were noted in foreign media, Japanese military officers were increasingly and openly talking about the prospect of war, and Admiral Sankichi Takahashi was reported as stating that a showdown with the US was necessary.

In an effort to discourage Japanese militarism, Western powers including Australia, the US, Britain, and the Dutch government in exile, which controlled the Dutch East Indies, stopped selling oil, iron ore, and steel to Japan. In Japan, the government and Japanese nationalists viewed these embargoes as acts of aggression; imported oil made up about 80% of domestic consumption, without which Japan&#x27;s economy would grind to a halt. The Japanese media, influenced by military propagandists, began to refer to the embargoes as the &quot;ABCD line&quot; (&quot;American-British-Chinese-Dutch&quot;).

===Japanese preparations===
The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters (GHQ) began planning for a war with the Western powers in April or May 1941. Japan increased its naval budget and placed large formations of the Army, along with their attached air components, under the command of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Historically, the IJA consumed the majority of the state&#x27;s military budget (with a 73% - 27% split in 1940), but from 1942 to 1945 the IJA would account for 60% of Japan&#x27;s military spending, while the IJN would account for 40%. Japan&#x27;s key initial objective was to seize economic resources in the Dutch East Indies and Malaya, in order to alleviate the effects of the Allied embargo. This was known as the Southern Plan. It was decided—because of the close relationship between the UK and the US, and the belief that the US would inevitably become involved in the ongoing war in Europe—that Japan would also seize the Philippines, Wake Island and Guam.

Japan had initially planned for a limited war, where Japanese forces would seize key objectives and then establish a defensive perimeter to absorb and defeat Allied counterattacks; Japanese decision-makers believed such a military situation would lead to a negotiated peace that would preserve Japanese territorial gains. Japanese planning divided the early war into two operational phases. The First Operational Phase was further divided into three separate parts in which the major objectives of the Philippines, British Malaya, Borneo, Burma, Rabaul and the Dutch East Indies would be occupied. The Second Operational Phase called for further expansion into the South Pacific by seizing eastern New Guinea, New Britain, Fiji, Samoa, and strategic points in around Australia. In the Central Pacific, Midway Island was targeted, as were the Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific. Japanese strategists believed that the seizure of these key areas would provide defensive depth and deny the Allies staging areas from which to mount a counteroffensive.

By November 1941 these plans were mostly complete, and were modified only slightly over the next month. Japanese military planners&#x27; expectation of success rested on the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union being unable to effectively respond to a Japanese attack because of the threat posed to each by Nazi Germany; in particular, the Soviet Union was seen as unlikely to commence hostilities.

The Japanese leadership was aware that a total military victory in the traditional sense against the United States was impossible, and instead envisaged that rapid, aggressive and expansive conquest would force the US to agree to a negotiated peace that would recognize Japanese hegemony in Asia.

==Japanese offensives, 1941–1942==
Following prolonged tensions between Japan and the Western powers, units of the IJN and IJA launched simultaneous surprise attacks on the United States and the British Empire on 7 December (8 December in Asia/West Pacific time zones). The locations of this first wave of Japanese attacks included the American territories of Hawaii, the Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island and the British territories of Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Concurrently, Japanese forces invaded southern and eastern Thailand and were resisted for several hours, before the Thai government signed an armistice and entered an alliance with Japan. Although Japan declared war on the United States and the British Empire, the declaration was not delivered until after Japanese forces had already struck British and American targets.

===Attack on Pearl Harbor===

In the early hours of 7 December (Hawaiian time), carrier-based Japanese aircraft launched a surprise, large-scale air strike on the US Pacific Fleet&#x27;s anchorage at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, which knocked eight American battleships out of action, destroyed 188 American aircraft, and killed 2,403 Americans. The Japanese believed that the Americans, faced with such a sudden and massive blow to their naval power in the Pacific, would agree to a negotiated settlement. However, American losses were less serious than initially thought: the three American aircraft carriers were at sea during the attack, and vital naval infrastructure, Honolulu&#x27;s submarine base, and signals intelligence units were unscathed. The fact that the bombing happened while the US was not officially at war caused a wave of outrage across the country. Japan&#x27;s fallback strategy, relying on a war of attrition against the United States, was beyond the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s capabilities.

Opposition to war in the United States vanished after the attack. On 8 December, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands declared war on Japan, followed by Australia the next day.

===South-East Asian campaigns of 1941–1942===
Thailand, with its territory already serving as a springboard for Japan&#x27;s Malayan Campaign, surrendered within hours of the Japanese invasion. The government of Thailand formally allied with Japan on 21 December. To the south, the IJA seized the British colony of Penang on 19 December, encountering little resistance.

Hong Kong was attacked on 8 December and fell to Japanese forces on 25 December 1941. American bases on Guam and Wake Island were seized by Japan at around the same time. British, Australian, and Dutch forces, already drained of personnel and matériel by two years of war with Germany, and heavily committed in the Middle East, North Africa, and elsewhere, were unable to provide more than token resistance. Two major British warships, the battlecruiser and the battleship , were sunk by a Japanese air attack off Malaya on 10 December 1941.

Following the Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942, the Allied governments appointed the British General Archibald Wavell to the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM), a supreme command for Allied forces in Southeast Asia. This gave Wavell nominal control of a huge force, albeit one that was thinly spread across a vast area, from Burma to the Philippines to northern Australia. Other regions, including India, Hawaii, and the rest of Australia, remained under local commands. On 15 January, Wavell moved to Bandung in Java to assume control of ABDACOM.

In January, Japan invaded British Burma, the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, and captured Manila, Kuala Lumpur and Rabaul. After being driven out of Malaya, Allied forces in Singapore attempted to resist the Japanese during the Battle of Singapore, but were forced to surrender to the Japanese on 15 February 1942. About 130,000 Indian, British, Australian and Dutch personnel became Japanese prisoners of war. Bali and Timor fell in February. The rapid collapse of Allied resistance left the &quot;ABDA area&quot; split in two. Wavell resigned from ABDACOM on 25 February, handing control of the ABDA Area to local commanders and returning to the post of Commander-in-Chief, India.

Meanwhile, Japanese aircraft had all but eliminated Allied air power in Southeast Asia and were carrying out air attacks on northern Australia, beginning with a bombing of the city of Darwin on 19 February, which killed at least 243 people.

At the Battle of the Java Sea in late February and early March, the IJN defeated the main ABDA naval force, under Admiral Karel Doorman. The Dutch East Indies campaign ended with the surrender of Allied forces on Java and Sumatra.

In March and April, an IJN carrier force launched a raid into the Indian Ocean. British Royal Navy bases in Ceylon were hit and the aircraft carrier was sunk, along with other Allied ships. The attack forced the Royal Navy to withdraw to the western part of the Indian Ocean, paving the way for a Japanese assault on Burma and India.

In Burma, the Japanese captured Moulmein on 31 January 1942, and then drove outnumbered British and Indian troops towards the Sittang River. On 23 February, a bridge over the river was demolished prematurely, stranding most of an Indian division. On 8 March, the Japanese occupied Rangoon. The Allies attempted to defend Central Burma, with Indian and Burmese divisions holding the Irrawaddy River valley and the Chinese Expeditionary Force in Burma defending Toungoo. On 16 April, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung, but subsequently rescued by the Chinese 38th Division, led by Sun Li-jen. Meanwhile, in the Battle of Yunnan-Burma Road, the Japanese captured Toungoo after hard fighting and sent motorized units to capture Lashio. This cut the Burma Road, which was the western Allies&#x27; supply line to Chinese Nationalist troops. Many of Chinese troops were forced either to retreat to India, or withdraw in small parties to Yunnan. Accompanied by large numbers of civilian refugees, the British retreated to Imphal in Manipur, abandoning most of their transportation and equipment. They reached Imphal in May just as the monsoon descended, which halted the operations of both sides in the area.

Within China, cooperation between the Chinese Nationalists and the Communists had waned from its zenith at the Battle of Wuhan, and the relationship between the two had soured as both attempted to expand their areas of operation and influence. The Japanese exploited this lack of unity to press their offensive operations in China.

===Philippines===

On 8 December 1941, Japanese bombers struck American airfields on Luzon. They caught most American planes on the ground, destroying 103 aircraft, more than half of the US air strength in the Philippines. Two days later, further air raids destroyed the Cavite Naval Yard. By 13 December, Japanese attacks had wrecked every major airfield and virtually annihilated American air power in the region. The previous month, a portion of the US Asiatic Fleet had been sent to the southern Philippines. However, with little air protection, the remaining surface vessels in the Philippines, especially the larger ships, were ordered to sail for Java or Australia, and the remaining American bombers in the area flew to Australia in mid-December. The only American forces that remained to defend the Philippines were the ground troops, a few fighter aircraft, about 30 submarines, and a few small vessels.

The main Japanese landings on Luzon took place on 22 and 24 December. As the Japanese troops converged on Manila, General Douglas MacArthur began executing plans to make a final stand on the Bataan Peninsula and the island of Corregidor. A series of rearguard actions brought the bulk of his troops safely into Bataan, while the Japanese entered Manila unopposed on 2 January 1942. On 7 January, the Japanese attacked Bataan. After some initial success, they were stalled by disease and casualties; however, Japanese forces could be reinforced, while the Americans and Filipinos were entirely isolated from resupply. On 11 March 1942, under orders from President Roosevelt, MacArthur abandoned Corregidor for Australia, and Lieutenant General Jonathan M. Wainwright assumed command in the Philippines. The defenders on Bataan, running low on ammunition and supplies, could no longer withstand the pressure from Japanese attacks. Bataan fell on 9 April, and the 76,000 American and Filipino prisoners of war taken on the peninsula were subjected to the long Bataan Death March. On the night of 5–6 May, after an intensive aerial and artillery bombardment, the Japanese landed on Corregidor and Wainwright surrendered. In the southern Philippines, where key ports and airfields had already been seized, the remaining American-Filipino forces surrendered on 9 May.

===Threat to Australia===
In late 1941, as the Japanese struck at Pearl Harbor, most of Australia&#x27;s best forces were committed in the Mediterranean Theatre. Australia was ill-prepared for an attack, lacking armaments, modern fighter aircraft, heavy bombers, and aircraft carriers. While still calling for reinforcements from Churchill, the Australian Prime Minister John Curtin called for American support with an announcement on 27 December 1941:


Australia had been shocked by the speed of the collapse of Commonwealth forces in British Malaya and Singapore, in which around 15,000 Australian soldiers became prisoners of war. Curtin predicted that the &quot;battle for Australia&quot; was imminent. The Japanese established a major base in the Australian Territory of New Guinea beginning with the capture of Rabaul on 23 January 1942. On 19 February 1942, Darwin was hit by an air raid, the first time the Australian mainland had come under foreign attack. Over the following 19 months, Australia was attacked from the air by the Japanese almost 100 times.

In early 1942, elements of the IJN proposed an invasion of Australia. The IJA opposed the plan and it was rejected in favor of isolating Australia via naval blockade, by advancing through the South Pacific. The Japanese decided upon a seaborne invasion of Port Moresby on the southern coast of New Guinea, which would put Northern Australia within range of Japanese bomber aircraft.

President Franklin Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to formulate a Pacific defense plan in conjunction with Australia in March 1942. Curtin agreed to place Australian forces under the command of MacArthur, who became Supreme Commander, South West Pacific. MacArthur moved his headquarters to Melbourne in March 1942 and American troops began massing in Australia. Japanese naval activity reached Sydney in late May 1942, when IJN midget submarines launched a raid on Sydney Harbour. On 8 June 1942, two Japanese submarines briefly shelled Sydney&#x27;s eastern suburbs and the city of Newcastle.

==Allies re-group, 1942–1943==
In early 1942, the governments of smaller Allied powers began to push for an inter-governmental Asia-Pacific war council. The Pacific War Council was formed in Washington DC on 1 April 1942, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, his key advisor Harry Hopkins, and representatives from Britain, China, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Canada. Representatives from India and the Philippines were later added. The council never had any direct operational control, and any decisions it made were referred to the US-UK Combined Chiefs of Staff. Australian and Dutch forces led civilians in a prolonged guerilla campaign in Portuguese Timor.

===Japanese strategy and the Doolittle Raid===
The Second Operational Phase was planned to expand Japan&#x27;s strategic depth by conquering eastern New Guinea, New Britain, the Aleutians, Midway, Fiji, Samoa, and strategic points in the Australian area. The Naval General Staff advocated an advance to the south to seize parts of Australia, but with large numbers of troops engaged in China and Manchuria, the IJA declined to contribute the necessary ground forces for the operation. The Naval General Staff still wanted to cut the sea links between Australia and the United States by capturing New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa. Because this required far fewer troops, on 13 March the Naval General Staff and the Army agreed to prepare for operations to capture Fiji and Samoa. The Second Operational Phase began when Lae and Salamaua, located in eastern New Guinea, were captured on 8 March. However, on 10 March, American carrier aircraft attacked the Japanese invasion forces and inflicted considerable losses. The raid had major operational implications, as it forced the Japanese to postpone their advance in the South Pacific until the Combined Fleet allocated sufficient naval forces to protect future offensive operations in the region.

Concurrently, the United States conducted the Doolittle Raid on the Japanese mainland in April 1942, in which 16 bombers took off from the aircraft carrier , from Japan. The raid inflicted minimal material damage on Japanese soil but was a significant boost for American morale; it also had psychological repercussions in Japan, exposing the danger to the Japanese homeland posed by American carrier forces. With only Marcus Island and a line of converted trawlers patrolling the vast waters that separate Wake Island and Kamchatka, the Japanese east coast was left open to further attacks similar to Doolittle.

Admiral Yamamoto proposed a strategy to bring about the destruction of the US Navy by occupying Midway Atoll, an objective he thought the Americans would be certain to fight for, as Japanese aircraft based on Midway could threaten Hawaii. During a series of meetings held from 2–5 April, the Naval General Staff and representatives of the Combined Fleet reached a compromise. Yamamoto was allowed to attempt his Midway operation, but only after he had threatened to resign. In return, Yamamoto had to allocate one carrier division to the operation against Port Moresby, as well as carrying out amphibious landings on strategic points in the Aleutian Islands simultaneously with the Midway operation. These concessions drew valuable Japanese military assets away from the attack on Midway, and were enough to remove the Japanese margin of superiority in the Midway attack.

===Coral Sea===

The Japanese assault on Port Moresby was codenamed the &quot;MO Operation&quot; and was divided into several parts. The island of Tulagi, in the Solomon chain, would be occupied on 3 May; IJN carriers would then conduct a sweep through the Coral Sea to the south in order to find and destroy Allied naval forces. The Japanese scheduled amphibious landings to capture Port Moresby for 10 May. The &quot;MO Operation&quot; called for a force of 60 vessels centered around two carriers, and 250 aircraft. However, the ensuing naval battle did not go according to plan for the Japanese; although Tulagi was seized on 3 May, the following day, aircraft from the American carrier struck the invasion force. The element of surprise was lost due to the success of Allied codebreakers. From the Allied perspective, if Port Moresby fell, the Japanese would control the seas to the north and west of Australia, and could effectively isolate the country from its allies in North America. An Allied task force under the command of Admiral Frank Fletcher, with the carriers and &quot;Yorktown&quot;, was assembled to stop the Japanese advance. On 7 May, the Japanese carriers launched a full strike on a contact reported to be Allied aircraft carriers, but the report turned out to be false. The strike force found and struck only an oiler, the , and the destroyer .

The American carriers also launched a strike with incomplete reconnaissance, and only located and sank the light aircraft carrier . On 8 May, the opposing carrier forces finally found each other and exchanged air strikes. Aircraft from the two Japanese carriers succeeded in sinking the carrier &quot;Lexington&quot; and damaging the carrier &quot;Yorktown&quot;. In return, the Americans damaged &quot;Shōkaku&quot;. Although &quot;Zuikaku&quot; was left undamaged, aircraft and personnel losses to &quot;Zuikaku&quot; were heavy and the Japanese naval forces were unable to support an amphibious landing on Port Moresby. As a result, the &quot;MO Operation&quot; was cancelled, and the Japanese were forced to abandon their attempts to isolate Australia.

Although they managed to sink an American carrier, the Japanese also suffered significant damage, as all three carriers that were committed to the battle would now be unavailable for the operation against Midway. After Coral Sea, the Japanese had four fleet carriers operational—, , and —and believed that the Americans had a maximum of two— and &quot;Hornet&quot;. was undergoing repair after a torpedo attack, while &quot;Yorktown&quot; had been damaged at Coral Sea and was believed by Japanese naval intelligence to have been sunk. Instead, she would sortie for Midway after just three days of repairs in Hawaii.

===Midway===

Admiral Yamamoto viewed the operation against Midway as the potentially decisive battle of the war, which could lead to the destruction of American strategic power in the Pacific, and subsequently allow for a negotiated peace settlement. Through strategic and tactical surprise, the Japanese would knock out Midway&#x27;s air strength and soften its defenses for a landing by 5,000 troops. After the capture of the island, the Combined Fleet planned to lay the basis for the most important part of the operation. Yamamoto hoped that the operation would lure the American surface fleet into a trap. The Japanese intended their attack on Midway to act as bait for the bulk of the US Navy&#x27;s strength in the Pacific, which Japanese planners anticipated would depart Pearl Harbor in order to defend the island. When the American vessels arrived, Yamamoto intended to concentrate his scattered naval forces to defeat them. Importantly, and concurrently to their attack on Midway, the Japanese launched Operation AL, an operation to seize two islands in the Aleutians.

In May, American codebreakers discovered the planned attack on Midway. Yamamoto&#x27;s complex plan contained no contingencies in the event that his fleet was found by the Americans before the Japanese had expected them. Planned surveillance of the American fleet in Pearl Harbor by long-ranged seaplanes did not occur as a result of an abortive identical operation in March. Additionally, Japanese submarine scouting lines that were supposed to be in place along the Hawaiian Islands were not ready on time.

The battle began on 3 June, when American aircraft from Midway spotted and attacked the Japanese transport group west of the atoll. On 4 June, the Japanese launched a 108-aircraft strike on the island, but failed to deliver a decisive blow to the island&#x27;s facilities. American ground-based aircraft on Midway were already airborne, adding to the 116 carrier aircraft on their way to attack the Japanese. The aircraft from Midway attacked the Japanese fleet, but failed to score a single hit. In the middle of these uncoordinated attacks, a Japanese scout aircraft reported the presence of an American task force, but it was not until later that the presence of an American carrier was confirmed. Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo was put in a difficult tactical situation. After quick deliberation, he opted for a delayed, but better-prepared, attack on the American task force.

At 10:22am, American SBD Dauntless dive bombers surprised and attacked three of the Japanese carriers. &quot;Sōryū&quot;, &quot;Kaga&quot;, and &quot;Akagi&quot; were destroyed in short order. A single Japanese carrier, &quot;Hiryū&quot;, remained operational, and launched an immediate counterattack. Her aircraft scored hits on &quot;Yorktown&quot; and put her out of action. Later in the afternoon, aircraft from the two remaining American carriers found and destroyed &quot;Hiryū&quot;. The crippled &quot;Yorktown&quot;, along with the destroyer , were later sunk by the Japanese submarine . With the striking power of the Kido Butai destroyed, Japan&#x27;s offensive naval power was significantly blunted. Early on the morning of 5 June, the Japanese cancelled the Midway operation.

===New Guinea and the Solomons===
Japanese land forces continued to advance in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. From July 1942, several Australian reserve battalions fought a stubborn rearguard action on New Guinea, delaying the Japanese advance along the Kokoda Track towards Port Moresby. These militia units were relieved in late August by troops from the Second Australian Imperial Force. In early September 1942 Japanese marines attacked a strategic Royal Australian Air Force base at Milne Bay, near the eastern tip of New Guinea. They were repulsed by Allied forces, the first defeat of the war for Japanese forces on land.

On New Guinea, the Japanese on the Kokoda Track came within sight of Port Moresby but were ordered to withdraw to the northeastern coast as fighting intensified between Japanese and Allied forces over Guadalcanal. Australian and American forces attacked the IJA&#x27;s fortified positions in the north, and after more than two months of fighting in the Buna–Gona area, finally captured the key Japanese beachhead on New Guinea in early 1943.

====Guadalcanal====
Allied forces became aware via coastwatchers of a Japanese airfield under construction at Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. On 7 August 1942, 16,000 US Marines landed on Guadalcanal and the island of Tulagi in the Solomons. Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa, commander of the newly formed IJN Eighth Fleet at Rabaul, quickly sortied with the ships under his command to engage the Allied force off the northern coast of Guadalcanal. On the night of 8–9 August, Mikawa&#x27;s ships surprised Allied naval forces in the Battle of Savo Island, sinking four Allied heavy cruisers and withdrawing with no losses of their own. The battle was one of the worst Allied naval defeats of the war. The Japanese victory was mitigated only by Mikawa&#x27;s failure to attack the Allied transport ships, which had been left vulnerable by the defeat at Savo Island. Had Mikawa done so, the American troops on Guadalcanal would have been left dangerously isolated and undersupplied, and the first American counterattack in the Pacific may have been halted. Separately, and importantly, the Japanese originally perceived the American landings in the Solomons as nothing more than a reconnaissance operation.

With Japanese and Allied forces both occupying parts of Guadalcanal, over the following six months both sides poured resources into an escalating battle of attrition over the island and its littoral. American ground-based aircraft at Henderson Field ensured American control of the waters around Guadalcanal during daytime, while the superior night-fighting capabilities of the IJN gave the Japanese the advantage at night. In August, Japanese and US carrier forces fought the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, resulting in the sinking of the IJN light carrier . In October, US forces successfully challenged the Japanese in night fighting during the Battle of Cape Esperance, sinking a Japanese cruiser and one destroyer for the loss of one destroyer of their own. During the night of 13 October, Japanese battleships &quot;Kongō&quot; and &quot;Haruna&quot; bombarded Henderson Field, temporarily disabling it; the airfield was swiftly returned to service by American engineers. On 26 October, the Japanese carriers &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; sank the American carrier &quot;Hornet&quot; and heavily damaged &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. The loss of &quot;Hornet&quot;, coupled with the earlier loss of to the IJN submarine and heavy submarine damage to &quot;Saratoga&quot; in September, meant that US carrier strength in the region was reduced to a single vessel, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. However, the two IJN carriers were forced to retire to home waters for repairs and aircrew replacements. From 12 to 15 November, Japanese and American surface ships engaged in night actions in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, one of the only two battles in the Pacific War during which battleships fought each other; two US admirals were killed and two Japanese battleships were sunk. The Japanese subsequently ceased attempts to bombard American positions on Guadalcanal from the sea.

During the campaign, most of the Japanese aircraft based in the South Pacific were redeployed to the defense of Guadalcanal. Many were lost in engagements with the Allied air forces, and the Japanese were largely unable to rescue their downed pilots in the region, attriting their pool of experienced combat airmen. Japanese ground forces launched repeated attacks on heavily defended American positions around Henderson Field, but were repulsed with high casualties. To sustain these offensives, resupply to IJA forces on Guadalcanal was carried out by Japanese convoys at night, termed the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; by the Allies. The convoys were challenged by American naval forces with increasing intensity as the campaign wore on, and the IJA troops on Guadalcanal began to suffer from disease and malnutrition as their lines of supply from the IJN were constricted. The multiple fleet battles involving heavier ships, as well as daytime carrier battles, resulted in the waters north of Guadalcanal becoming known as &quot;Ironbottom Sound&quot;, due the dozens of ships from both sides that were sunk in the area. Over the course of the campaign, however, the Allies were much better able to replace their losses than the Japanese, and by late 1942 the Japanese decided to abandon Guadalcanal. The Japanese evacuated their remaining troops from the island and withdrew in February 1943. Over six months, the Japanese had committed their forces to Guadalcanal piecemeal, and had proved unable to withstand the attrition of such an protracted and intense campaign. The battle had painfully exposed the internal rifts and rivalries that divided the Japanese military regime, and frequently paralyzed its ability to craft coherent strategies and react dynamically to challenges by Allied forces.

Ultimately, nearly 20,000 Japanese soldiers died on Guadalcanal, compared to just over 7,000 Americans. The Japanese had also lost a significant number of transports and experienced aircrew, valuable assets that they could not easily or quickly replace. Victory on Guadalcanal provided a significant boost to Allied morale, and had awarded them the strategic initiative in the Pacific theater.

==Stalemate in China and Southeast Asia==
===China 1942–1943===
In early 1942 in mainland China, the Japanese 3rd, 6th, and 40th Divisions, a total of around 120,000 troops, massed at Yueyang and advanced southward in three columns, attempting again to cross the Miluo River to reach Changsha. In January 1942, Chinese forces scored a victory at Changsha, the first Allied success against Japan.

After the Doolittle Raid, the IJA conducted the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, with the goal of locating surviving American airmen, punishing the Chinese who had aided them and destroying air bases. This operation started on 15 May 1942 with 40 infantry and 15–16 artillery battalions, but was repelled by Chinese forces by September. During this campaign, the IJA engaged in biological warfare, spreading cholera, typhoid, plague and dysentery throughout Japanese-occupied areas of China. Chinese estimates put the death toll from Japanese-inflicted biological warfare at 250,000 civilians. Around 1,700 Japanese troops died, out of a total 10,000 who fell ill when Japanese biological weapons infected their own forces.

On 2 November 1943, Isamu Yokoyama, commander of the Japanese 11th Army, deployed around 100,000 troops to attack Changde. During the seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese forced Japan to fight a campaign of attrition. Although the Japanese captured the city, the Chinese were able to pin them down long enough for reinforcements to arrive and encircle them. The Chinese then cut Japanese supply lines, prompting the Japanese to retreat, pursued by Chinese forces. During the battle, Japan used chemical weapons.
=== Burma 1942–1943 ===
In the aftermath of the Japanese conquest of Burma, there was widespread public disorder and pro-independence agitation in eastern India, as well as a famine in Bengal, causing up to 3 million deaths. Wavell (commander-in-chief in India) was eager to mount British counterattacks into Burma.

The British subsequently initiated an offensive in Arakan intended to secure Akyab island, considered vital for its port and airfield. The 14th Indian Infantry Division advanced overland down the Mayu peninsula. The offensive was stalled at Rathedaung and Donbaik, only a few miles north of Akyab, by numerically inferior but well-fortified Japanese forces. Repeated assaults by Commonwealth forces from January to March 1942 failed to overcome these positions. A Japanese division was redeployed to Arakan from Central Burma and proceeded to attack the 14th Indian Division&#x27;s exposed left flank, overrunning several units. The headquarters of the 26th Indian Infantry Division took over command of the front, and intended to conduct a counterattack, but its troops were exhausted and the division was forced to fall back to the Indian frontier in the first week in May.

Most British officers accepted that the failure resulted from inadequate training for jungle warfare. To offset the results of the Arakan offensive, the Allies widely publicized a long distance raid mounted by the Chindits under Brigadier Orde Charles Wingate. The raid itself was a mixed success; the Chindits suffered heavy losses (1,138 out of a force of just over 3,000) and inflicted only minor damage to the Japanese lines of communication. Wingate insisted that ordinary British and Indian troops could fight in the jungle as easily as the Japanese. The raid also contributed to the Japanese decision to invade India during 1944.

In August 1943 the Allies formed a new South East Asia Command (SEAC) to take over strategic responsibilities for Burma and India from the Commander-in-Chief, India, who headed the British Indian Army. In October 1943 Winston Churchill appointed Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten as its Supreme Commander. Wavell was appointed Viceroy of India and immediately took measures to address the famine in Bengal. General Claude Auchinleck became commander in chief of the Indian Army and restructured its administration and training departments. The British and Indian Fourteenth Army was formed to face the Japanese in Burma. Under Lieutenant General William Slim, its training, morale and health greatly improved. The American General Joseph Stilwell, who commanded US forces in the China Burma India Theater, directed aid to China and prepared to construct the Ledo Road to link India and China.

In 1943, the Thai Phayap Army invasion headed to Xishuangbanna in China, but were driven back by the Chinese Expeditionary Force.

==Allied offensives, 1943–1944==
After Midway, the US began to harness its vast industrial potential to greatly increase production of ships, planes, and other materiel, and to train more airmen at an increasing rate. At the same time, Japan, lacking an adequate industrial base, coherent technological strategy, comprehensive aircrew training program or adequate naval resources and commerce defense, began to fall behind. The Allies began a protracted offensive campaign across the Pacific theater, seizing several island bases in a series of (often bloody) amphibious assaults against determined Japanese defenders. Some Japanese strongholds like Truk, Rabaul, and Formosa, were neutralized by air attack and bypassed. The goal was to get close to Japan itself, then launch massive strategic air attacks, improve the submarine blockade, and finally (only if necessary) execute an invasion.

The US Navy did not seek out the Japanese fleet for a decisive battle. The Allied advance could only be stopped by a Japanese naval attack, which increasing oil shortages (induced by submarine attack) were rendering increasingly impossible.

===Allied offensives on New Guinea and up the Solomons===

In June 1943, the Allies launched Operation Cartwheel, a series of amphibious invasions to recapture the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, and ultimately isolate the major Japanese forward base at Rabaul. Following the Japanese invasion of Salamaua–Lae in March 1942, Cartwheel began with the Salamaua–Lae campaign in Northern New Guinea in April 1943, which was followed in June to October by the New Georgia campaign, in which the Allies used the Landings on Rendova, as well as the Drive on Munda Point and accompanying Battle of Munda Point to secure a secretly constructed Japanese airfield at Munda and the rest of New Georgia Islands group. Landings from September until December secured the Treasury Islands and landed Allied troops on Choiseul, Bougainville and Cape Gloucester.

These landings prepared the way for Nimitz&#x27;s island-hopping campaign towards Japan.

=== Invasion of the Gilbert and Marshall Islands ===

In November 1943, US Marine forces sustained high casualties when they overwhelmed the 4,500-strong Japanese garrison at Tarawa Atoll. This experience drove the Allies to improve their techniques of amphibious landings, implementing changes such as thorough pre-emptive aerial bombings and shore bombardment, more careful planning regarding tides and landing schedules, and better unit coordination. Operations in the Gilbert Islands were followed in late-January and mid-February 1944 by further, but less costly, landings on the Marshall Islands.

===Cairo Conference===

On 22 November 1943 US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and ROC Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek met in Cairo, Egypt, to discuss a strategy to defeat Japan. The meeting was also known as the Cairo Conference and concluded with the Cairo Declaration.

===Submarine warfare===
Throughout the war, American, British and Dutch submarines operated out of bases at Cavite in the Philippines (1941–1942),Fremantle and Brisbane in Australia, Pearl Harbor, Trincomalee in Ceylon, Midway, and later on Guam. Allied submarine forces played a major role in defeating Japan, even though submarines made up only a small proportion of the Allied navies—less than two percent in the case of the US Navy. Submarines strangled Japanese commercial and military shipping, inflicting severe damage on its merchant fleet, intercepting many troop transports, and cutting off nearly all the oil imports essential to weapons production and military operations. In particular, the fuel situation grew so acute that prior to the Battle of Leyte Gulf in late 1944, Japanese naval strategists were uncertain that the attacking IJN fleet would even have the ability to withdraw to safety, regardless of which way the battle went. By early 1945, Japanese oil supplies were so limited that the remaining IJN fleet was virtually stranded in the anchorages that they lay at.

The Japanese military claimed to have sunk 468 Allied submarines during the war. In reality, only 42 American submarines were sunk in the Pacific due to hostile action, with 10 others lost in accidents or as the result of friendly fire. The Dutch lost five submarines due to Japanese attack or minefields, and the British lost three.

American submarines accounted for 56% of the Japanese merchantmen sunk; mines or air attack destroyed most of the rest. American submariners also claimed 28% of all Japanese warships destroyed. In addition, submarines played important reconnaissance roles and rescued hundreds of downed fliers.

Within hours of Pearl Harbor, in retribution against Japan, Roosevelt promulgated a new doctrine: unrestricted submarine warfare against Japanese shipping. This meant sinking any warship, commercial vessel, or passenger ship in Japanese-controlled waters, without warning and without aiding survivors. The United States itself had a long supply line, leaving it vulnerable to submarine attack, but Japan utilized its submarines primarily for long-range reconnaissance, only occasionally attacking US supply lines.

As the war turned against Japan, IJN submarines increasingly served to resupply island strongholds that had been cut off, such as Truk and Rabaul. In addition, Japan honored its neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union and ignored American freighters shipping military supplies from San Francisco to Vladivostok, much to the consternation of its German ally.

American submarines, by contrast, engaged in extensive commerce raiding from the outset of hostilities. However, the problem of Allied forces surrounded in the Philippines in early 1942 led to diversion of submarines to &quot;guerrilla submarine&quot; missions. Basing in Australia placed boats under Japanese aerial threat while &quot;en route&quot; to patrol areas, reducing their effectiveness, and Nimitz relied on submarines for close surveillance of Japanese bases. The standard-issue Mark 14 torpedo and its Mark VI exploder both proved defective and were not corrected until September 1943. Before the war, a US Customs officer had seized a copy of the Japanese merchant marine code, not knowing that the Office of Naval Intelligence had broken it. The Japanese promptly changed it, and the new code was not broken again by OP-20-G until 1943.

In 1944 the US Navy restructured its submarine fleet, installing effective shipboard radar on its 150 submarines, replacing commanders that were deemed not aggressive enough, and fixing design flaws in the torpedoes. Japanese commerce protection was &quot;shiftless beyond description&quot;, and Japanese convoys were poorly organized and defended compared to those of the Allies. The number of American submarines patrols (and sinkings) rose steeply as the war progressed: 350 patrols (180 ships sunk) in 1942, 350 (335) in 1943, and 520 (603) in 1944. By 1945, sinkings of Japanese vessels had decreased because there were so few ships left to target at all. In sum, Allied submarines destroyed 1,200 Japanese merchant ships – about five million tons of shipping. At critical stages of the Guadalcanal, Saipan, and Leyte campaigns, thousands of Japanese troops were killed or diverted from where they were needed due to the actions or threat of submarine attack. Over 200 IJN warships were sunk, including a battleship and no fewer than eight carriers.

Underwater warfare was especially dangerous; of the 16,000 Americans who went out on submarine patrol, 3,500 (22%) never returned, the highest casualty rate of any American force in World War II. The Japanese losses, 130 submarines in all, were even higher.

==Japanese offensives in Asia, 1944==

===Japanese counteroffensives in China, 1944===
In mid-1944, Japan marshalled over 500,000 troops on the Chinese mainland and launched its largest ground offensive of the war, codenamed Operation Ichi-Go. The goal of the offensive was to connect Japanese-controlled territory in China and French Indochina by land, in part to alleviate the catastrophic losses suffered by Japanese merchant shipping, as well as to capture airbases in southeastern China where American bombers were based. Though Japan suffered about 100,000 casualties, it gained significant territory in China before Ichi-Go ground to a halt near Guangxi. Despite major tactical victories, the operation overall failed to provide Japan with any significant strategic gains. A majority of the Chinese forces involved in the battle were able to retreat out of the area, and would later return to attack Japanese positions at the Battle of West Hunan. Japanese losses in the Pacific meant that Japan was unable to accrue the time and resources needed to achieve victory over China. Operation Ichi-Go created a sense of social confusion in the areas of China that it affected. Chinese Communist guerrillas were able to exploit this confusion to expand their influence and gain control of greater areas of the countryside in the aftermath of the fighting.

===Japanese offensive in India, 1944===

After the Allied setbacks in 1943, the South East Asia command prepared to launch offensives into Burma on several fronts. In early 1944, the Chinese and American troops of the Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC), commanded by the American general Joseph Stilwell, began extending the Ledo Road from India into northern Burma, while the Indian XV Corps began an advance along the coast in Arakan Province. In February 1944, the Japanese mounted a local counter-attack in Arakan. After early Japanese success, this counter-attack was defeated in the Battle of the Admin Box when the isolated Indian divisions of XV Corps repelled a concerted Japanese assault, relying on supplies dropped by parachute.

The Japanese launched a long-planned offensive, codenamed Operation U-Go, into India in mid-March 1944. Lieutenant General Slim, commanding Fourteenth Army, and his forward commander, Lieutenant General Geoffry Scoones, planned to withdraw into the Imphal plain and force the Japanese to fight with their communications stretching over miles of primitive jungle trails. However, they were slow to respond when the Japanese attack commenced and did not foresee several Japanese objectives. Some British and Indian units had to fight their way out of encirclement, and by early April Commonwealth forces had concentrated around Imphal. Several units were flown from the Arakan to reinforce them. A Japanese division that had advanced to Kohima in Nagaland cut the main road to Imphal and isolated a small British garrison, but failed to break through Kohima&#x27;s defenses. During April, the Japanese attacks against Imphal itself failed, while fresh Allied formations relieved the garrison of Kohima and drove the Japanese from the positions they had captured on Kohima ridge.

As many Japanese military planners had feared, their inadequate lines of communication and the failure of Mutaguchi&#x27;s gamble on an early victory meant that their troops began to starve. Once the monsoon rains descended in mid-May, IJA troops also began succumbing to disease in large numbers. During May, while Mutaguchi continued to order attacks, the Allies advanced southwards from Kohima and northwards from Imphal. The two Allied attacks met on 22 June, breaking the Japanese siege of Imphal. The Japanese finally broke off the operation on 3 July. They had lost over 50,000 troops, mainly to starvation and disease—the worst defeat suffered by the IJA to that date.

Although the advance in Arakan had been halted to make troops and aircraft available for the Battle of Imphal, the Americans and Chinese had continued to advance in northern Burma, aided by reinforced Chindit units operating against Japanese lines of communication. In mid-1944, the Chinese Expeditionary Force invaded northern Burma, capturing a fortified position at Mount Song. By the time campaigning ceased during the monsoon, the Northern Combat Area Command had secured a vital airfield at Myitkyina after a prolonged siege, which eased the problems of air resupply from India to China over &quot;The Hump&quot;.

==Beginning of the end in the Pacific, 1944==
In May 1943, the Japanese prepared Operation Z or the Z Plan, which envisioned utilizing Japanese naval power to counter American forces threatening the outer defense perimeter line, which ran from the Aleutians down through Wake, the Marshall and Gilbert Islands, Nauru, the Bismarck Archipelago, New Guinea, and then westward past Java and Sumatra to Burma. In 1943–1944, Allied forces in the Solomons began driving relentlessly toward Rabaul, eventually encircling and neutralizing the stronghold while leaving it in Japanese hands. With their position in the Solomons disintegrating, the Japanese modified the Z Plan by eliminating the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, as well as the Bismarck Archipelago, as vital areas to be defended as part of their outer perimeter. Japanese planners instead focused on the defense of a smaller inner perimeter, which included the Marianas, Palau, Western New Guinea, and the Dutch East Indies. Meanwhile, in the Central Pacific, the Americans initiated a major offensive, beginning in November 1943 with landings in the Gilbert Islands. Japanese garrisons in the Gilberts, and then the Marshalls, were methodically seized via amphibious assault. The Japanese strategy of holding overextended island garrisons had proven impossible to accomplish in practice.

In February 1944, during Operation Hailstone, the US Navy&#x27;s fast carrier task force carried out a series of large-scale air raids on the major IJN naval base at Truk. Although the Japanese had moved their major vessels out in time to avoid being caught at anchor in the atoll, two days of Allied air attacks still resulted in significant losses to Japanese aircraft and merchant shipping. The Japanese navy was forced to abandon Truk as a primary anchorage, and was now unable to effectively counter the Americans on any front along the perimeter. Consequently, the Japanese decided to husband their remaining naval strength for what they hoped would be a decisive battle at sea in the near future. Accordingly, the Japanese then developed a new plan, known as &quot;A-GO&quot;: a decisive fleet action that would be fought somewhere from the Palaus to the Western Carolines. It was in this area that the newly formed Mobile Fleet, along with large numbers of land-based aircraft, would be concentrated. A-GO envisioned land-based aircraft, operating from airfields on islands in the defense perimeter, carrying out a first wave of attacks against the American fleet, wherever along the perimeter it appeared. Once the location along the perimeter of the attacking American vessels had been determined, A-GO called for the IJN&#x27;s Mobile Fleet to intercept, engage and destroy it, supported by land-based airpower.

===Marianas and Palaus===

On 12 March 1944, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered the seizure of the Northern Marianas, with a target date of 15 June. All forces for the Marianas operation—535 warships and auxiliaries together with a ground force of over 127,500 troops—were to be commanded by Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. For the Americans, securing the Marianas would disrupt the movement of Japanese airpower to and from the southern Pacific, allow for the construction of advanced naval bases closer to Japan, and provide airfields from which B-29 bombers could reach the Japanese Home Islands. Seizing the Marianas would also offer American commanders several possible objectives for the next phase of operations, which would keep the Japanese uncertain and hinder their defensive preparations. It was also hoped that a penetration of the Japanese inner defense zone might provoke the Japanese fleet to sail out in strength for a decisive engagement, offering the opportunity to cripple the Japanese navy in a single battle. The ability to plan and execute such a complex operation in the space of 90 days was indicative of the high degree of logistical &amp; operational superiority that Allied strategists enjoyed over their Japanese counterparts at this stage of the war.

On 15 June, the 2nd and 4th Marine Divisions landed on the island of Saipan, supported by naval bombardment. However, Japanese resistance on shore was intense, and the first day&#x27;s objective was not reached until D+3. Despite fanatic Japanese opposition and some desperate fighting, the Marines captured Aslito airfield on 18 June. Nafutan, Saipan&#x27;s southern point, was secured on 27 June. In the north, Mount Tapotchau, the highest point on the island, was also taken on 27 June. The Marines then steadily advanced northward. On the night of 6–7 July, three to four thousand Japanese carried out a massed banzai charge that penetrated American lines near Tanapag before being repulsed. Following this attack, hundreds of civilians on Saipan committed mass suicide, most of whom were Japanese colonists, often at the instigation of fanatical IJA troops. By 9 July, organized Japanese resistance on Saipan had ceased. The U.S. Marines reached northernmost tip of Saipan, Marpi Point, twenty-four days after the landing. Only isolated groups of hidden Japanese holdouts remained.

A month after the invasion of Saipan, the US recaptured Guam and captured Tinian, just south of Saipan. Saipan and Tinian were used extensively by the US military, as they finally placed mainland Japan within round-trip range of American B-29 bombers. Japanese air units attacked the bases on Saipan and Tinian intermittently from November 1944 to January 1945. Until the end of the war, the United States Army Air Forces based out of these islands conducted an intense strategic bombing campaign against Japanese cities of military and industrial importance, including Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe.

The invasion of Peleliu in the Palau Islands on 15 September was notable for a drastic change in Japanese defensive tactics, resulting in the highest casualty rate amongst US forces in an amphibious operation during the Pacific War. In a departure from the Japanese strategy in previous island battles such as Tarawa and Saipan, where defending IJA troops intensely contested the landing beaches but not the island interior, on Peleliu the Japanese constructed extensive fortifications within the ridges that dominated the center of the island. This was an example of &quot;fukkaku&quot;, or honeycomb, tactics that Japanese island garrisons would again utilize during the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945. Instead of the predicted four days, it took over two months and over 10,000 casualties for American forces to secure the island. The strategic value of the landings is still contested.

===Philippine Sea===
When the Americans landed on Saipan in the Marianas, the Japanese viewed holding the island as imperative, and initiated plan A-GO. The Japanese navy deployed its largest carrier force of the war for the forthcoming battle: the nine-carrier Mobile Fleet under Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, supplemented by 500 land-based aircraft. Facing them was the US Fifth Fleet under Admiral Raymond A. Spruance: 15 fleet carriers and 956 aircraft. The clash was the largest carrier battle in history.

On 19 June, a series of Japanese carrier air strikes on the Fifth Fleet were shattered by strong American defenses. The lopsided engagement was later dubbed the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;, a testament to the catastrophic losses suffered by Japanese carrier aircrew in the battle. All US carriers had combat-information centers, which interpreted the flow of radar data and radioed interception orders to the combat air patrols. The few Japanese planes that made it through patrolling American fighters and reached the Fifth Fleet fleet did so in a staggered sequence, only to encounter massed anti-aircraft fire with proximity fuses. Only one American warship was slightly damaged. On the same day, &quot;Shōkaku&quot; was hit by four torpedoes from the submarine and sank with heavy loss of life. The was also sunk by a single torpedo from the submarine . The next day, on 20 June, the Japanese carrier force was subjected to sustained American carrier air attack and suffered the loss of the carrier &quot;Hiyō&quot;. The four Japanese carrier air strikes involved 373 aircraft, of which 130 returned. Many of these survivors were subsequently lost when &quot;Taihō&quot; and &quot;Shōkaku&quot; were sunk by American submarine attacks. After the second day of the battle, Japanese losses totaled three carriers and 445 aircrew, along with more than 433 carrier aircraft and around 200 land-based aircraft. The Americans lost 130 aircraft and 76 aircrew, with many due to aircraft running out of fuel returning to their carriers at night.

Although the Japanese defeat at the Philippine Sea was severe in terms of the loss of the three fleet carriers, the more significant impact on Japan&#x27;s war effort was the evisceration of the IJN&#x27;s carrier air groups. The IJN had spent the better part of a year reconstituting its carrier air arm, and the Americans had destroyed 90% of it in two days. The Japanese had only enough pilots left to form an air group for a single light carrier. The Mobile Fleet returned home with only 35 aircraft of the 430 that it had embarked with. The battle ended in a comprehensive Japanese defeat, and virtually erased the IJN&#x27;s ability to project airpower at sea.

===Leyte Gulf, 1944===
The loss at the Philippine Sea left the Japanese with two options: either launch an all-out offensive employing the IJN&#x27;s remaining surface vessels against the next American amphibious landing, or allow the Americans to cut the sea lanes between the Home Islands and Southeast Asia. The Japanese opted for the former, and sought to utilize their last remaining strength – the firepower of their heavy cruisers and battleships – against the American beachhead at Leyte in the Philippine islands in October 1944. The Japanese planned to use their remaining carriers as bait to lure the American carriers away from Leyte Gulf long enough for heavy warships to enter and to destroy any American ships present.

The Japanese assembled four carriers, nine battleships, 14 heavy cruisers, seven light cruisers, and 35 destroyers for this operation. These forces were split into three formations: the &quot;Center Force&quot;, under the command of Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita, which included the battleships and ; the &quot;Northern Force&quot;, under the command of Ozawa, which had four carriers and two battleships partly converted to carriers, but was largely bereft of planes; and the &quot;Southern Force&quot;, containing one group of battleships, cruisers and destroyers under the command of Shōji Nishimura and another under Kiyohide Shima. The Center Force would pass through the San Bernardino Strait into the Philippine Sea, turn southwards, and then attack the transports at anchor near the American beachhead on Leyte. The Southern Force would strike at the beachhead littoral through the Surigao Strait, while the Northern Force would lure the main American covering forces away from Leyte. Functioning as a decoy, Ozawa&#x27;s carriers embarked just 108 aircraft.

However, after the Center Force departed from Brunei Bay on 23 October, two American submarines attacked it, resulting in the loss of two heavy cruisers with another crippled. After entering the Sibuyan Sea on 24 October, Center Force was again waylaid by American carrier aircraft, forcing another heavy cruiser to retire. The Americans then sank &quot;Musashi&quot;. Many other ships of Center Force were also attacked, but continued on. Convinced that their attacks had rendered the Center Force ineffective and that it had turned back, the American carriers sailed north to address the newly detected threat Ozawa&#x27;s Northern Force and its carriers. On the night of 24–25 October, the Southern Force under Nishimura attempted to enter Leyte Gulf from the south through Surigao Strait, where an American-Australian force led by Rear Admiral Jesse Oldendorf ambushed the Japanese. American destroyers and naval gunfire destroyed two battleships and three destroyers, with only a single Japanese destroyer surviving. As a result of observing radio silence, Shima&#x27;s group was unable to coordinate its movements with Nishimura&#x27;s group and arrived at Surigao Strait at the worst possible moment, in the middle of the encounter; after making a haphazard torpedo attack, Shima retreated.

Off Cape Engaño, north of Leyte Gulf, the Americans launched over 500 aircraft sorties at the Northern Force, followed by a surface group of cruisers and destroyers. All four Japanese carriers were sunk, but the Japanese had succeeded in drawing the American carriers away from Leyte Gulf. On 25 October the final major surface action fought between the Japanese and the American fleets occurred off Samar, when Kurita&#x27;s Center Force fell upon a group of American escort carriers accompanied only by destroyers and destroyer escorts. Both sides were surprised, but the outcome looked certain, given the overwhelming advantage in firepower possessed by the Japanese. However, the Center Force conducted a largely indecisive gunnery duel before breaking off, managing only to sink several American destroyers and two escort carriers.

Overall Japanese losses in the battle were extremely heavy, with four carriers, three battleships, six heavy cruisers, four light cruisers and eleven destroyers sunk. The Americans lost one light carrier, two escort carriers, two destroyers and two destroyer escorts. The Battle of Leyte Gulf was the largest naval battle of World War II and arguably the largest naval battle in history. It was also the only time that an aircraft carrier was sunk by surface warship in the Second World War, when the Japanese Center Force sank the escort carrier &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; off Samar. For the Japanese, the defeat at Leyte Gulf was catastrophic—its navy&#x27;s greatest ever loss of ships and men in combat. The inevitable liberation of the Philippines also meant that the Japanese Home Islands would be virtually cut off from the vital resources in Japan&#x27;s occupied territories across Southeast Asia.

===Philippines, 1944–1945===

On 20 October 1944 the US Sixth Army, supported by naval and air bombardment, landed on the favorable eastern shore of Leyte, north of Mindanao. The US Sixth Army continued its advance from the east, while the Japanese rushed reinforcements to the western side. The US reinforced the Sixth Army successfully, but the US Fifth Air Force devastated Japanese attempts to resupply IJA troops on the island. In torrential rains and over difficult terrain, the US advance continued across Leyte and the neighboring island of Samar to the north. On 7 December US Army units landed and, after a major land and air battle, cut off the Japanese ability to reinforce and supply Leyte. Although fierce fighting continued on Leyte for months, the US Army was in control.

On 15 December 1944, landings against minimal resistance took place on the southern beaches of the island of Mindoro, a key location in the planned Lingayen Gulf operations, in support of major landings scheduled on Luzon. On 9 January 1945 General Krueger&#x27;s Sixth Army landed its first units on the western coast of Luzon. Almost 175,000 men followed within a few days. With heavy air support, Army units pushed inland, taking Clark Field, northwest of Manila, in the last week of January.

Two more major landings followed, one to cut off the Bataan Peninsula, and another, which included a parachute drop, south of Manila. Pincers closed in on the city, and on 3 February 1945 American forces pushed into Manila proper. The month-long battle for Manila resulted in over 100,000 civilian deaths and was the scene of the worst urban fighting by American forces in the Pacific theater. As the advance on Manila continued from the north and the south, the Bataan Peninsula was rapidly secured. On 16 February paratroopers and amphibious units assaulted the island fortress of Corregidor, and Japanese resistance ended there on 27 February.

In all, ten US divisions and five independent regiments fought on Luzon, making it the largest ground campaign of the Pacific War, involving more troops than the US had used in North Africa, Italy, or southern France. Forces included the Mexican Escuadrón 201 fighter-squadron as part of the Fuerza Aérea Expedicionaria Mexicana, with the squadron attached to the 58th Fighter Group of the United States Army Air Forces that flew tactical support missions. Of the 250,000 Japanese troops defending Luzon, 80 percent died. The last Japanese holdout in the Philippines, Hiroo Onoda, finally surrendered on 9 March 1974.

The Eighth Army invaded Palawan Island, between Borneo and Mindoro (the fifth-largest and westernmost Philippine island) on 28 February 1945, with landings at Puerto Princesa. The Japanese put up little direct defense of Palawan, but cleaning up pockets of Japanese resistance lasted until late April, as the Japanese used their common tactic of withdrawing into the mountain jungles, dispersed as small units. Throughout the Philippines, Filipino guerrillas aided US forces to dispatch the holdouts.

The US Eighth Army moved on to its first landing on Mindanao (17 April), the last of the major Philippine Islands to be taken. Then followed the invasion and occupation of Panay, Cebu, Negros and several islands in the Sulu Archipelago. These islands provided bases for the US Fifth and Thirteenth Air Forces to attack targets throughout the Philippines and the South China Sea.

==Final stages==
===Allied offensives in Burma, 1944–1945===

In late 1944 and early 1945, the Allied South East Asia Command launched offensives into Burma, intending to recover most of the country, including the capital of Rangoon, before the onset of the monsoon in May. The offensives were fought primarily by British Commonwealth, Chinese and American forces against Japan, assisted to some degree by Thailand, the Burma National Army and the Indian National Army. The Commonwealth land forces were drawn primarily from the United Kingdom, British India, and Africa.

The Indian XV Corps (including two West African divisions) advanced along the coast in Arakan Province, at last capturing Akyab Island. They landed troops behind the retreating Japanese, inflicting heavy casualties, and captured Ramree Island and Cheduba Island, establishing airfields used to support the offensive into Central Burma. The Chinese Expeditionary Force captured Mong-Yu and Lashio, while the Chinese and American Northern Combat Area Command resumed its advance in northern Burma. In late January 1945, these two forces linked up at Hsipaw. The Ledo Road was completed, linking India and China, but too late in the war to have any significant strategic effect on operations in China.

The Japanese Burma Area Army attempted to forestall the main Allied attack by withdrawing their troops behind the Irrawaddy River. Lieutenant General Heitarō Kimura, the new Japanese commander in Burma, hoped that the Allies&#x27; lines of communications would be overstretched trying to cross this obstacle. However, the advancing British Fourteenth Army switched its axis of advance to outflank the Japanese.

During February, the Fourteenth Army secured bridgeheads across the Irrawaddy. On 1 March, mechanized units of IV Corps captured the supply node of Meiktila, throwing the Japanese defenses into disarray. While the Japanese attempted to recapture Meiktila, XXXIII Corps captured Mandalay. The Japanese armies were heavily defeated, and with the capture of Mandalay, the Burmese population and the Burma National Army (which the Japanese had initially created) turned against the Japanese.

During April, Fourteenth Army advanced south towards Rangoon, but was delayed by Japanese rearguards to the north. Slim feared that the Japanese would defend Rangoon in house-to-house during the monsoon, which would commit his army to prolonged action with disastrously inadequate supplies, and in March he had asked that a plan to capture Rangoon by an amphibious force, Operation Dracula, which had been abandoned earlier, be reinstated. &quot;Dracula&quot; was launched on 1 May, only to find that the Japanese had already evacuated the city. The troops that occupied Rangoon linked up with Fourteenth Army five days later, securing the Allies&#x27; lines of communication.

Japanese forces that had been bypassed by the Allied advances attempted to break out across the Sittaung River during June and July to rejoin the Burma Area Army, which had regrouped in Tenasserim in southern Burma. They suffered 14,000 casualties, half of their strength. Overall, the Japanese lost some 150,000 men in Burma. Only 1,700 Japanese soldiers surrendered and were taken prisoner. The Allies were preparing to make amphibious landings in Malaya when word of the Japanese surrender arrived.

===Iwo Jima===

Although the Marianas were secure and American bases firmly established, the long range from the Marianas meant that B-29 aircrews bombing Japan found themselves ditching at sea if severely damaged. To alleviate this issue, American strategists focused their attention on the small island of Iwo Jima, about halfway between the Marianas and Japan. American planners recognized the strategic importance of the island. It was used by the Japanese as an early-warning station against impending air raids on Japanese cities. Japanese aircraft based on Iwo Jima were able to attack the B-29s on their bombing missions, and even to attack installations in the Marianas themselves. The capture of Iwo Jima would provide emergency landing airfields for B-29s and a base for P-51 fighter escorts, as well as land-based air support to protect US naval fleets sailing close to the Japanese Home Islands.
The Japanese had also come to realize the strategic value of Iwo Jima, and Lt. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi was assigned command of the island&#x27;s garrison in May 1944. The Japanese began constructing elaborate defenses, making the best possible use of the island&#x27;s natural caves and uneven, rocky terrain. The island was transformed into a massive network of bunkers, hidden guns, and underground passageways leading from one strongpoint to another. The Japanese also went to great lengths to construct large underground chambers, some as much as five stories deep, to serve as storage and hospital areas with thick walls and ceilings of reinforced concrete. A series of strongpoints covering the landing areas were also built, most covered with sand and carefully camouflaged. Well-hidden 120mm and 6-inch guns were emplaced so that their fire could be directed to the beaches. Smaller-caliber artillery, antiaircraft guns, and mortars were also hidden and located where only a direct hit could destroy them. The Japanese were determined to make the Americans pay a high price for Iwo Jima, and were prepared to defend it to the death. Kuribayashi knew that he could not win the battle, but he nonetheless hoped to inflict casualties so costly that it would slow the American advance on Japan, and perhaps give the Japanese government bargaining power in negotiations to end the war. By February 1945, a total of 21,000 Japanese troops were deployed on Iwo Jima.

The American operation (&quot;Operation Detachment&quot;) to capture the island involved three Marine divisions of the V Amphibious Corps, a total of 70,647 troops, under the command of Holland Smith. From mid-June 1944, Iwo Jima came under American air and naval bombardment, until the days leading up to the invasion.

An intense naval and air bombardment preceded the landing, but did little except drive the Japanese defenders further underground and further mangle the island&#x27;s barren volcanic terrain. Most Japanese fortifications survived the bombardment virtually unscathed. On the morning of 19 February 1945, 30,000 men under the command of Maj. General Harry Schmidt landed on the southeast coast near Mt. Suribachi, the dormant volcano around which most of the island&#x27;s defenses were concentrated. As soon as the Marines pushed inland they came under devastating machine gun and artillery fire. By the end of the day, the Marines reached the west coast, but their losses were severe: almost 2,000 men killed or wounded. On 23 February, the 28th Marine Regiment reached the summit of Mt. Suribachi, prompting the now famous &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot; photograph, often cited as the most reproduced photograph in history and the archetypal representation of the Pacific War. For the rest of February, the Americans grinded north through a maze of Japanese defenses. By 1 March, they had taken two-thirds of the island. It was not until 26 March that the island was secured.

Iwo Jima was one of the bloodiest battles fought by the Americans during the Pacific War. American casualties were 6,821 killed and 19,207 wounded. The Japanese losses totaled well over 20,000 men killed, with only 1,083 prisoners taken. It was the only major island battle in the Pacific war where American casualties outnumbered Japanese losses. Historians continue to debate whether Iwo Jima was strategically worth the casualties sustained in capturing it.

===Okinawa===

The largest and bloodiest battle fought by the Americans against the Japanese took place on Okinawa. The seizure of islands in the Ryukyus was meant to be the last step before an invasion of Japan proper. Okinawa, the largest of the Ryukyu Islands, was located from Kyushu. The capture of Okinawa would provide airbases that could intensify aerial bombardment of Japan and offer direct land-based air support to an invasion of Kyushu. Seizing the islands would also allow the Americans to further tighten the blockade of Japan and be used as a staging area and supply base for any invasion of the Home Islands.

The Japanese troops defending Okinawa, under the command of Lieutenant General Mitsuru Ushijima, were a mixed force some 75,000–100,000 strong, augmented by thousands of conscripted civilians. American forces for the operation totaled 183,000 troops in seven divisions (four US Army and three Marine) under the Tenth Army. The British Pacific Fleet operated as a separate unit; its objective was to strike airfields on the chain of islands between Formosa and Okinawa, to prevent the Japanese from reinforcing Okinawa.

After an intense seven-day bombardment, the main landings on Okinawa took place on 1 April 1945, on the Hagushi beaches on the island&#x27;s west coast. The Japanese did not contest the landings, and there was little opposition at the beaches, as the Japanese had decided to meet the Americans farther inland, out of range of naval gunfire. About 60,000 American troops landed on the first day, seizing two nearby airfields and pushing across the narrow width of the island.

The first major Japanese counterattack occurred on 6 and 7 April, in the form of attacks by kamikaze aircraft and a naval operation, called &quot;Ten-Go&quot;. Under the command of Admiral Seiichi Itō, the battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;, the light cruiser and eight destroyers sortied from Kyushu as bait, meant to draw away as many American carrier aircraft as possible from Okinawa, in order to leave Allied naval forces vulnerable to large-scale kamikaze attacks. As a consequence of crippling Japanese shortages, the &quot;Yamato&quot; had only enough fuel to reach Okinawa. If she managed to reach the island,&quot;Yamato&quot; was ordered to beach herself and use her guns to support Japanese forces with indirect fire. After being sighted by an American submarine and reconnaissance aircraft, the &quot;Yamato&quot;, &quot;Yahagi&quot; and four of the destroyers were sunk in a multi-hour blitz of aerial attacks by American carrier aircraft. Mass kamikaze attacks on American vessels near Okinawa intensified during the following three months, with 5,500 sorties being flown by the Japanese.

In the northern part of Okinawa, American troops only met light opposition, and the area was captured within about two weeks. However, the main Japanese defenses were in the south. There was bitter fighting against well-entrenched Japanese troops, but US forces slowly made progress. The seizure of Shuri castle on 29 May, the linchpin of Japanese resistance in the south, represented both a strategic and psychological blow to the remaining Japanese defenders. Organized resistance did not cease until 21 June; and many Japanese went into hiding. The campaign was not declared over until 2 July.

The battle for Okinawa proved costly and lasted much longer than the Americans had expected. The Japanese skillfully utilized terrain to inflict maximum casualties upon Allied ground forces. Total American casualties were 49,451, including 12,520 dead or missing and 36,631 wounded. Japanese casualties were approximately 110,000 killed and 7,400 taken prisoner. 94% of the Japanese soldiers died, along with many civilians. Kamikaze attacks sank 36 ships, damaged 368 more and killed 4,900 US sailors, for the loss of 7,800 Japanese aircraft.

===China, 1945===
Despite Japanese victories in Operation Ichi-Go, Japan was losing the battle in Burma and facing constant attacks from Chinese Nationalist forces and Communist guerrillas in the countryside. The IJA began preparations for the Battle of West Hunan in March 1945, mobilizing 80,000 men to seize Chinese airfields and secure railroads in West Hunan by early April. In response, the Chinese National Military Council dispatched the 4th Front Army and the 10th and 27th Army Groups with He Yingqin as commander-in-chief. At the same time, it airlifted the entire American-equipped Chinese New 6th Corps, along with veterans of the Burma Expeditionary Force, from Kunming to Zhijiang. Chinese forces totaled 110,000 men, supported by about 400 aircraft from Chinese and American air forces. Chinese forces decisively repulsed the Japanese advance, and subsequently launched a large counterattack. Concurrently, the Chinese repelled a Japanese offensive in Henan and Hubei. Afterwards, Chinese forces retook Hunan and Hubei in South China. Chinese forces launched a counteroffensive to retake Guangxi, the last major Japanese stronghold in South China. In August 1945, Chinese forces retook Guangxi.

===Borneo, 1945===

The Borneo campaign of 1945 was the last major campaign in the South West Pacific Area. In a series of amphibious assaults between 1 May and 21 July, the Australian I Corps, under General Leslie Morshead, attacked Japanese forces occupying the island. Allied naval and air forces, centered on the US 7th Fleet under Admiral Thomas Kinkaid, the Australian First Tactical Air Force and the US Thirteenth Air Force also played important roles in the campaign.

The campaign opened with a landing on the small island of Tarakan on 1 May. This was followed on 1 June by simultaneous assaults in the northwest, on the island of Labuan and the coast of Brunei. A week later the Australians attacked Japanese positions in North Borneo. The attention of the Allies then switched back to the central east coast, with the last major amphibious assault of World War II taking place at Balikpapan on 1 July.

Although the campaign was criticized in Australia as a &quot;waste&quot; of the lives of soldiers, it achieved a number of objectives, such as increasing the isolation of significant Japanese forces occupying the Dutch East Indies, capturing major oil supplies and freeing Allied prisoners of war, who were being held in deteriorating conditions. At one of the very worst sites, around Sandakan in Borneo, only six of 2,500 British and Australian prisoners survived.

===Landings in the Japanese home islands (1945)===

Hard-fought battles on the Japanese islands of Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and others resulted in horrific casualties on both sides before finally producing a Japanese defeat. Of the 117,000 Okinawan and Japanese troops defending Okinawa, 94 percent died. Faced with the loss of most of their experienced pilots, the Japanese increased their use of kamikaze tactics in an attempt to create unacceptably high casualties for the Allies. The US Navy proposed to force a Japanese surrender through a total naval blockade and air raids. Many military historians believe that the Okinawa campaign led directly to the atomic bombings as a means of avoiding the ground invasion of Japan. This view is explained by Victor Davis Hanson: &quot;because the Japanese on Okinawa... were so fierce in their defense (even when cut off, and without supplies), and because casualties were so appalling, many American strategists looked for an alternative means to subdue mainland Japan, other than a direct invasion. This means presented itself, with the advent of atomic bombs, which worked admirably in convincing the Japanese to sue for peace [unconditionally], without American casualties.&quot;

Towards the end of the war, as strategic bombing became more important, a new command for the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific was created to oversee all US strategic bombing in the hemisphere, under General Curtis LeMay. Japanese industrial production plunged as nearly half of the built-up areas of 67 cities were destroyed by B-29 firebombing raids. On 9–10 March 1945 LeMay oversaw Operation Meetinghouse, in which 300 B-29s dropped 1,665 tons of bombs, mostly napalm-carrying M-69 incendiary bombs, on the Japanese capital. This attack is seen the most destructive bombing raid in history and killed between 80,000 and 100,000 people in a single night, destroying over 270,000 buildings and leaving over 1 million homeless. In the ten days that followed, almost 10,000 bombs were dropped, destroying 31% of Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Kobe.

LeMay also oversaw Operation Starvation, in which the inland waterways of Japan were extensively mined by air, which disrupted the little remaining Japanese coastal sea traffic. On 26 July 1945, US President Harry S. Truman, Chiang, and Churchill issued the Potsdam Declaration, which outlined the terms of surrender for Japan that were agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference. This ultimatum stated that, if Japan did not surrender, it would face &quot;prompt and utter destruction&quot;.

===Atomic bombs===

On 6 August 1945, the US dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in the first nuclear attack in history. In a press release issued after the bombing, Truman warned Japan to surrender or &quot;expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this Earth&quot;. On 9 August, the US dropped another atomic bomb on Nagasaki. More than 140,000–240,000 people died as a direct result of these two bombings. The necessity of the atomic bombings has long been debated, with detractors claiming that a naval blockade and incendiary bombing campaign had already made invasion, hence the atomic bomb, unnecessary. However, other scholars have argued that the atomic bombings shocked the Japanese government into surrender and helped avoid Operation Downfall, or a prolonged blockade and conventional bombing campaign, any of which would have exacted much higher casualties among Japanese civilians. Historian Richard B. Frank wrote that a Soviet invasion of Japan was never likely because they had insufficient naval capability.

===Soviet entry===
In February 1945 during the Yalta Conference the Soviet Union had agreed to enter the war against Japan 90 days after the surrender of Germany. At the time, Soviet participation was seen as crucial in order to tie down the large number of Japanese forces in Manchuria and Korea, keeping them from being transferred to the Home Islands to defend against an invasion.

On 9 August, exactly on schedule, the Soviet Union entered the war by invading Manchuria. A battle-hardened, one million-strong Soviet force, transferred from Europe, attacked Japanese forces of the &quot;Kantōgun&quot; (Kwantung Army) across most of the Manchurian frontier.

The Manchurian strategic offensive operation began on 9 August 1945, with the Soviet invasion of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. This was the last campaign of the Second World War, and the largest of the 1945 Soviet–Japanese War, which resumed hostilities between the USSR and Japan after almost six years of peace. Soviet forces conquered Manchukuo, Mengjiang (Inner Mongolia) and northern Korea. The USSR&#x27;s entry into the war was a significant factor in the Japanese decision to surrender, as it became apparent to the government in Tokyo that the Soviets were no longer willing to act as an intermediary for a negotiated settlement on terms favorable to Japan.

In late 1945, the Soviets launched a series of successful invasions of northern Japanese territories, in preparation for the possible invasion of Hokkaido:
* Invasion of South Sakhalin (11–25 August)
** Maoka Landing (19–22 August)
* Invasion of the Kuril Islands (18 August to 1 September)
** Battle of Shumshu (18–23 August)

===Surrender===

Months of American air and naval attacks, two atomic bombings, and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria had a profound impact on Japanese decision-making. On 10 August 1945, Japanese Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki and his cabinet decided to accept the Potsdam terms on one condition: the &quot;prerogative of His Majesty as a Sovereign Ruler&quot;. At noon on 15 August, after the American government&#x27;s intentionally ambiguous reply, stating that the &quot;authority&quot; of the Emperor &quot;shall be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers&quot;, the Emperor Hirohito broadcast the rescript of surrender.

In Japan, 14 August is considered the end of the Pacific War. However, as Imperial Japan actually surrendered on 15 August, this day became known in the English-speaking countries as V-J Day (Victory in Japan). The formal Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed on 2 September 1945. The surrender was accepted by MacArthur as Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. MacArthur then went to Tokyo to oversee the occupation of Japan (from 28 August 1945 to 28 April 1952, when the Treaty of San Francisco came into force).

==Casualties==
===Allied===
====United States====

American casualties were 107,903 killed in action and 208,333 wounded. The figure for battle deaths include Army prisoners who died in Japanese captivity; this is the standard itemization of for US deaths in the Pacific War. However, historian John W. Dower notes that there are inconsistencies within the official US statistics themselves. The total number of deaths in the Pacific theaters rises to 132,723 if 24,820 non-combat Army deaths are included. Over half of all American losses suffered in the Pacific occurred between July 1944 and July 1945. Combined, the US and allied navies lost nearly 200 warships, including 4 battleships, 12 aircraft carriers, 25 cruisers, 84 destroyers and destroyer escorts, 63 submarines, and nearly 30,000 aircraft. This gave the Allies a 2–1 exchange ratio with the Japanese in terms of ships and aircraft.

The US protectorate in the Philippines suffered considerable losses. Military losses were 27,000 dead (including POWs), 75,000 living POWs, and an unknown number wounded, not counting irregulars that fought in the insurgency. Between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Filipino civilians died due to war-related shortages, massacres, shelling, and bombing.

====China====
* Chinese state media outlet &quot;China Daily&quot; lists the total number of military and non-military casualties, both dead and wounded, at 35 million. Duncan Anderson, Head of the Department of War Studies at the Royal Military Academy, states that the total number of casualties was around 20 million.
* The official account of the war published in Taiwan reported that the Nationalist Chinese Army lost 3,238,000 men (1,797,000 wounded, 1,320,000 killed, and 120,000 missing) and 5,787,352 civilians casualties putting the total number of casualties at 9,025,352. The soldiers of the Chinese Communist Party suffered 584,267 casualties, of which 160,603 were killed, 133,197 missing, and 290,467 wounded. This would equate to a total of 3.82 million combined NRA/CCP casualties, of which 1.74 million were killed or missing.
* An academic study published in the United States estimates Chinese military casualties as 1.5 million killed in battle, 750,000 missing in action, 1.5 million deaths due to disease and 3 million wounded; civilian casualties: due to military activity, 1,073,496 killed and 237,319 wounded; 335,934 killed and 426,249 wounded in Japanese air attacks.
* Rudolph Rummel gave a figure of 3,949,000 people in China murdered directly by the Japanese army while giving a figure of 10,216,000 total dead in the war with the additional millions of deaths due to indirect causes like starvation or disease. Famines during the war caused by drought affected both China and India: the Chinese famine of 1942–1943 in Henan led to starvation deaths of 2 to 3 million people, Guangdong famine caused more than 3 million people to flee or die, and the 1943–1945 Indian famine in Bengal killed about 7 million Indian civilians in Bihar and Bengal.
* According to historian Mitsuyoshi Himeta, at least 2.7 million civilians died during the &quot;kill all, loot all, burn all&quot; operation (Three Alls Policy) implemented in May 1942 in north China by general Yasuji Okamura.
* The property loss suffered by the Chinese was valued at 383 billion US dollars according to the currency exchange rate in July 1937, roughly 50 times the gross domestic product of Japan at that time. The war created 95 million refugees.

====Commonwealth====
Between the Malayan Campaign (130,000 discounting some 20,000 Australians), Burma Campaign (86,600), Battle of Hong Kong (15,000), and various naval encounters, British, Dominion and Empire forces incurred some 235,000 casualties in the Pacific Theater, including roughly 82,000 killed (50,000 in combat and 32,000 as POWs).

Britain incurred 90,332 casualties, of whom 29,968 were killed, 12,433 as prisoners of war. The Japanese captured a total of 50,016 POWs from Britain.

The Royal Navy lost 23 warships in the Pacific and Indian oceans: 1 battleship, 1 battlecruiser, 1 aircraft carrier, 3 cruisers, 8 destroyers, 5 submarines, and 4 escorts. There were significant indirect losses to the British Empire territories of India and Burma, including 3 million deaths in the Bengal famine and 0.25 to 1 million deaths in British Burma.

Australia incurred casualties of 45,841 not including natural deaths: 17,501 killed (including POW deaths in captivity), 13,997 wounded, and 14,345 living POWs. New Zealand lost 578 killed, with an unknown number wounded or captured. 294 Canadians were killed in Hong Kong and the Aleutians, and a further 1,691 were captured, of whom 273 died as POWs, for a total of 567 dead. Eight Royal Australian Navy warships were sunk: 3 cruisers (&quot;Canberra&quot;, &quot;Perth&quot;, and &quot;Sydney&quot;), 2 destroyers, and 3 corvettes.

====Others====
Between Lake Khasan, Khalkin Gol, advisors deployed to China, and the 1945 operations in Manchuria and the Kuriles, Soviet casualties against Japan totaled 68,612: 22,731 killed/missing and 45,908 wounded. Material losses included some 1,000 tanks and AFVs, 5 landing ships, and 300 aircraft. Mongolian casualties were 753.

The entire 140,000-strong Royal Dutch East Indies Army was killed, captured, or missing by the conclusion of the East Indies Campaign. 1,500 colonial and 900 Dutch soldiers were killed in action. Most of the colonial soldiers were freed on the spot or deserted. Of the ethnic Dutch troops, 900 were killed in action and 37,000 became prisoners. 8,500 of these POWs would die in Japanese captivity. Dutch naval losses in the Pacific numbered 2 cruisers, 7 destroyers, 5 submarines, 7 minelayers, and 7 minesweepers. About 30,000 Dutch and 300,000 Indonesian forced laborers died during the Japanese occupation of the East Indies, while 3 million Indonesian civilians perished in famines.

Similar to the Dutch, the 65,000-strong French colonial army in French Indochina (16,500 European French and 48,500 colonial) disintegrated at the end of the Japanese invasion. 2,129 European French and 2,100 Indochinese colonial troops were killed, while 12,000 French and 3,000 colonial troops were kept as prisoners. 1–2 million deaths occurred in French Indochina during the Japanese occupation, mostly due to the 1945 Vietnamese Famine.

===Axis===
Eight hundred thousand Japanese civilians and over 2 million Japanese soldiers died during the war. According to a report by the Relief Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare in 1964, combined Japanese Army and Navy deaths during the war (1937–1945) numbered approximately 2,121,000 men, mostly against either the Americans (over 1.3 million), or against Chinese factions (over 500,000). The losses were broken down as follows:
General George C. Marshall put Japanese &quot;battle dead&quot; against the Americans at 965,000 (South Pacific: 684,000, Central Pacific: 273,000, Aleutians: 8,000), with 37,308 captured, from 7 December 1941 to 30 June 1945 (the war had yet to conclude). These are juxtaposed with the losses in the theater of the US Army alone, suggesting Japanese naval casualties were not included. His figure for Japanese &quot;battle dead&quot; in China was 126,000 in the same period.

The IJN lost over 341 warships, including 11 battleships, 25 aircraft carriers, 39 cruisers, 135 destroyers, and 131 submarines, almost entirely in action against the US Navy. The IJN and IJA together lost 45,125 aircraft.

Germany lost ten submarines and four auxiliary cruisers (, , , and ) in the Indian and Pacific oceans.

===War crimes===


====By Japan====
During the Pacific War, Japanese soldiers killed millions of non-combatants, including prisoners of war, from surrounding nations. At least 20 million Chinese died during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Three Alls Policy was responsible for the deaths of more than 2.7 million Chinese civilians.

The Nanjing Massacre is the most infamous example of Japanese atrocities against civilians during the war. According to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, more than 200,000 Chinese civilians were killed, while the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal concluded that over 300,000 died. The Manila massacre killed over 100,000 Filipino civilians. Japan also employed biological weapons.

According to the findings of the Tokyo Tribunal, the death rate of Western prisoners was 27%, seven times that of Western POWs under the Germans and Italians. Some of the more notorious instances of abuse of prisoners were the Bataan Death March and forced labor in the construction of the Burma–Thailand &quot;Death Railway&quot;. Around 1,536 US civilians died in Japanese internment camps, compared to 883 in German internment camps.

A widely publicized example of institutionalized sexual slavery are comfort women—200,000 women and girls, mostly from Korea and China, who were forced to serve in Japanese military camps.

====By the Allies====

The firebombing of Tokyo has been described by writer Jonathan Rauch as a war crime. A United States Strategic Bombing Survey estimated that 84% of the attacked area was residential, mostly inhabited by women, children and the elderly; the over 100,000 victims constitute the deadliest aerial bombing raid in history.

American soldiers commonly collected the body parts of dead Japanese soldiers as trophies. American soldiers are alleged to have committed rapes during the Battle of Okinawa.

====Tribunals====
The International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Ichigaya from 29 April 1946 to 12 November 1948 tried those accused of the most serious war crimes. Military tribunals were also held throughout Asia and the Pacific.

<text>A national grassland is an area of protected and managed federal lands in the United States authorized by Title III of the Bankhead–Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937 and managed by the United States Forest Service. For administrative purposes, they are essentially identical to national forests, except that grasslands are areas primarily consisting of prairie. Like national forests, national grasslands may be open for hunting, grazing, mineral extraction, recreation and other uses. Various national grasslands are typically administered in conjunction with nearby national forests.

All but four national grasslands are on or at the edge of the Great Plains. Those four are in southeastern Idaho, northeastern California, central Oregon, and a reserve in Illinois. The three national grasslands in North Dakota, together with one in northwestern South Dakota, are administered jointly as the Dakota Prairie Grasslands. National grasslands are generally much smaller than national forests – while a typical national forest would be about , the average size of a national grassland is . The largest, the Little Missouri National Grassland in North Dakota, covers , which is approximately the median size of a national forest. As of September 30, 2007, the total area of all 20 national grasslands was .

==Soil Conservation Service==

The catastrophic Dust Bowl of the 1930s led to the creation of the Soil Conservation Service in 1933. This and subsequent federal laws paved the way for establishing national grasslands.

==Related==
The smaller Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, created much later and east of the Mississippi River, is technically not a &quot;National Grassland&quot;, as it was formed under different legislation, but it is managed by the Forest Service like one, as a unique prairie resource.

<text>Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxy-&quot;trans&quot;-stilbene) is a stilbenoid, a type of natural phenol or polyphenol and a phytoalexin produced by several plants in response to injury or when the plant is under attack by pathogens, such as bacteria or fungi. Sources of resveratrol in food include the skin of grapes, blueberries, raspberries, mulberries, and peanuts.

Although commonly used as a dietary supplement and studied in laboratory models of human diseases, there is no high-quality evidence that resveratrol improves lifespan or has a substantial effect on any human disease.
==Research==
Resveratrol has been studied for its potential therapeutic use, with little evidence of anti-disease effects or health benefits in humans.

===Cardiovascular disease===
There is no evidence of benefit from resveratrol in people who already have heart disease. A 2018 meta-analysis found no effect on systolic or diastolic blood pressure; a sub-analysis revealed a 2 mmHg decrease in systolic pressure only from resveratrol doses of 300 mg per day, and only in diabetic people. A 2014 Chinese meta-analysis found no effect on systolic or diastolic blood pressure; a sub-analysis found an 11.90 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure from resveratrol doses of 150 mg per day.

===Cancer===
, there is no evidence of an effect of resveratrol on cancer in humans.

===Metabolic syndrome===
There is no conclusive evidence for an effect of resveratrol on human metabolic syndrome. One 2015 review found little evidence for use of resveratrol to treat diabetes. A 2015 meta-analysis found little evidence for an effect of resveratrol on diabetes biomarkers.

One review found limited evidence that resveratrol lowered fasting plasma glucose in people with diabetes. Two reviews indicated that resveratrol supplementation may reduce body weight and body mass index, but not fat mass or total blood cholesterol. A 2018 review found that resveratrol supplementation may reduce biomarkers of inflammation, TNF-α and C-reactive protein.

===Lifespan===
, there is insufficient evidence to indicate that consuming resveratrol has an effect on human lifespan.

===Cognition===
Resveratrol has been assessed for a possible effect on cognition, but with mixed evidence for an effect. One review concluded that resveratrol had no effect on neurological function, but reported that supplementation improved recognition and mood, although there were inconsistencies in study designs and results.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===

A 2022 meta-analysis provided preliminary evidence that resveratrol, alone or in combination with glucose and malate, may slow cognitive decline in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===Diabetes===

Although animal experiments have found some evidence that resveratrol may help improve insulin sensitivity and so potentially help manage diabetes, subsequent research on people is limited and does not support the use of resveratrol for this purpose.

===Other===
There is no significant evidence that resveratrol affects vascular endothelial function, neuroinflammation, skin infections or aging skin. A 2019 review of human studies found mixed effects of resveratrol on certain bone biomarkers, such as increases in blood and bone alkaline phosphatase, while reporting no effect on other biomarkers, such as calcium and collagen.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Resveratrol has been identified as a pan-assay interference compound, which produces positive results in many different laboratory assays. Its ability for varied interactions may be due to direct effects on cell membranes.

As of 2015, many specific biological targets for resveratrol had been identified, including NQO2 (alone and in interaction with AKT1), GSTP1, estrogen receptor beta, CBR1, and integrin αVβ. It was unclear at that time if any or all of these were responsible for the observed effects in cells and model organisms.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

The viability of an oral delivery method is unlikely due to the low aqueous solubility of the molecule. The bioavailability of resveratrol is about 0.5% due to extensive hepatic glucuronidation and sulfation. Glucuronidation occurs in the intestine as well as in the liver, whereas sulfonation not only occurs in the liver but in the intestine and by microbial gut activity. Due to rapid metabolism, the half-life of resveratrol is short (about 8–14 minutes), but the half-life of the sulphate and glucoronide metabolites is above 9 hours.

=== Metabolism ===
Resveratrol is extensively metabolized in the body, with the liver and intestines as the major sites of its metabolism. Liver metabolites are products of phase II (conjugation) enzymes, which are themselves induced by resveratrol in vitro.

== Chemistry ==
Resveratrol (3,5,4&#x27;-trihydroxystilbene) is a stilbenoid, a derivative of stilbene. It exists as two geometric isomers: &quot;cis-&quot; (&quot;Z&quot;) and &quot;trans-&quot; (&quot;E&quot;), with the &quot;trans&quot;-isomer shown in the top image. Resveratrol exists conjugated to glucose.

The &quot;trans-&quot; form can undergo photoisomerization to the &quot;cis-&quot; form when exposed to ultraviolet irradiation.

UV irradiation to cis-resveratrol induces further photochemical reaction, producing a fluorescent molecule named &quot;Resveratrone&quot;.

&quot;Trans&quot;-resveratrol in the powder form was found to be stable under &quot;accelerated stability&quot; conditions of 75% humidity and 40 °C in the presence of air. The &quot;trans&quot; isomer is also stabilized by the presence of transport proteins. Resveratrol content also was stable in the skins of grapes and pomace taken after fermentation and stored for a long period. lH- and 13C-NMR data for the four most common forms of resveratrols are reported in literature.

=== Biosynthesis ===
Resveratrol is produced in plants via the enzyme resveratrol synthase (stilbene synthase). Its immediate precursor is a tetraketide derived from malonyl CoA and 4-coumaroyl CoA. The latter is derived from phenylalanine.

=== Biotransformation ===
The grapevine fungal pathogen &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; is able to oxidise resveratrol into metabolites showing attenuated antifungal activities. Those include the resveratrol dimers restrytisol A, B, and C, resveratrol trans-dehydrodimer, leachinol F, and pallidol. The soil bacterium &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot; can be used to transform resveratrol into piceid (resveratrol 3-O-beta-D-glucoside).

== Adverse effects ==
Only a few human studies have been done to determine the adverse effects of resveratrol, all of them preliminary with small participant numbers. Adverse effects resulted mainly from long-term use (weeks or longer) and daily doses of 1000 mg or higher, causing nausea, stomach pain, flatulence, and diarrhea. A review of 136 patients in seven studies who were given more than 500 mg for a month showed 25 cases of diarrhea, 8 cases of abdominal pain, 7 cases of nausea, and 5 cases of flatulence. A 2018 review of resveratrol effects on blood pressure found that some people had increased frequency of bowel movements and loose stools.

== Occurrences ==

=== Plants ===
Resveratrol is a phytoalexin, a class of compounds produced by many plants when they are infected by pathogens or physically harmed by cutting, crushing, or ultraviolet radiation. Plants that synthesize resveratrol include Japanese knotweed, pine trees (including Scots pine and Eastern white pine), Concord grape vines, raspberries, mulberries, peanut plants, cocoa bushes, and &quot;Vaccinium&quot; shrubs that produce berries, including blueberries, cranberries, and bilberries.

=== Foods ===
The levels of resveratrol found in food varies considerably, even in the same food from season to season and batch to batch.

==== Wine and grape juice ====
Resveratrol concentrations in red wines average trans-resveratrol/L (), ranging from nondetectable levels to 14.3 mg/L (62.7 μM) &quot;trans&quot;-resveratrol. Levels of &quot;cis&quot;-resveratrol follow the same trend as &quot;trans&quot;-resveratrol.

In general, wines made from grapes of the Pinot noir and St. Laurent varieties showed the highest level of &quot;trans&quot;-resveratrol, though no wine or region can yet be said to produce wines with significantly higher concentrations than any other wine or region. Champagne and vinegar also contain appreciable levels of resveratrol.

Red wine contains between 0.2 and 5.8 mg/L, depending on the grape variety. White wine has much less because red wine is fermented with the skins, allowing the wine to extract the resveratrol, whereas white wine is fermented after the skin has been removed. The composition of wine is different from that of grapes since the extraction of resveratrol from grapes depends on the duration of the skin contact, and the resveratrol 3-glucosides are in part hydrolysed, yielding both &quot;trans&quot;- and &quot;cis&quot;-resveratrol.

Though its extraction (i.e. from wood chips or other sources) during artificial ageing, resveratrol is added in red wines to improve the color and sensory properties.

==== Selected foods ====
Ounce for ounce, peanuts have about 25% as much resveratrol as red wine. Peanuts, especially sprouted peanuts, have a content similar to grapes in a range of 2.3 to 4.5 μg/g before sprouting, and after sprouting, in a range of 11.7 to 25.7 μg/g, depending on peanut cultivar.

Mulberries (especially the skin) are a source of as much as 50 micrograms of resveratrol per gram dry weight.

Most US supplements of resveratrol are derived from the root of Reynoutria japonica (also called Japanese knotweed, Hu Zhang, etc.)

== History ==
The first mention of resveratrol was in a Japanese article in 1939 by Michio Takaoka, who isolated it from &quot;Veratrum album&quot;, variety &quot;grandiflorum&quot;, and later, in 1963, from the roots of Japanese knotweed. In 2004, Harvard University professor David Sinclair co-founded Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, the initial product of which was a resveratrol formulation. Sirtris was purchased and made a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million and shut down in 2013, without successful drug development.

<text>Patrick Houston Shaw-Stewart (17 August 1888 – 30 December 1917) was a British scholar and poet of the Edwardian era who died on active service as a battalion commander in the Royal Naval Division during the First World War. He is best remembered today for his &quot;Achilles in the Trench&quot;, one of the best-known war poems of the First World War.
==Life==
Patrick Shaw-Stewart was born in Aber Artro Hall, near Llanbedr in Merionethshire, Wales. He was the son of Major-General John Heron Maxwell Shaw-Stewart (1831–1908), a military engineer, and Mary Catherine Bedingfeld Shaw-Stewart. While Patrick was still young his parents&#x27; marriage broke down and he was largely raised by a nanny, whom he habitually referred to as &quot;dear&quot;. His appearance was quite striking with a shock of bright ginger hair, pale white freckled skin, and a lengthy nose.

His career was one of great academic brilliance, matched by a steely determination to succeed. He came first in the Eton scholarship in 1901, a year after his friend, Ronald Knox, had come first in the same examination. He won the Newcastle Scholarship at Eton in 1905. At Oxford, he won the Craven, the Ireland, and the Hertford Scholarships in Classics as well as taking a double first in Classical Moderations in 1908 and Greats in 1910. Elected to a fellowship of All Souls&#x27; College, Oxford, he instead, due to the prospect of considerable financial rewards, committed his career to Barings Bank, where he was appointed one of the youngest managing directors in the bank&#x27;s history, in 1913.

At this time he became devoted to Lady Diana Manners and wrote her many intimate letters full of erotic allusions to Greek and Latin literature, though it proved to be a case of unrequited love, as Manners was devoted to Raymond Asquith, and after his death married Duff Cooper. He became a leading member of her &quot;corrupt coterie&quot; known as the Coterie. Another member of the Coterie, Julian Grenfell, said of Shaw-Stewart at this time &quot;animals edge away from him, and the more intelligent the animal, the more they edge away from him&quot;, and also &quot;I think there is something rather obscene about him, like the electric eel at the zoo.&quot; Raymond Asquith&#x27;s pithy appraisal was &quot;not long enough in the bottle&quot;. Both found his single-minded preoccupation with achieving wealth and status somewhat distasteful.

Shaw-Stewart served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. When war was declared in 1914, he joined the Royal Naval Division, serving with Rupert Brooke. Shaw-Stewart was present at Brooke&#x27;s burial on Skyros and commanded the firing party. He was shaken by his prominent role in the young poet&#x27;s funeral in Greece: &quot;The brilliant and beguiling youth who had never failed in anything, for whom all life&#x27;s prizes seemed to wait his taking, had little wish to outlive his friends. He now used all his charm and influence in high places to get into the firing line.&quot;

While he was at Imbros he seemed to enjoy speaking ancient Greek to the inhabitants of the island; in one of his letters he wrote: &quot;here I am, living in a Greek village and talking the language of Demosthenes to the inhabitants (who are really quite clever at taking my meaning).&quot;

Shaw-Stewart was involved in the Gallipoli campaign, which was his first experience of real combat. His letters home to friends and relations showed an increasing sense of frustration and disillusionment with the war. After the Allied withdrawal from the Dardanelles, he was posted to Salonika in a liaison role with the French.

In 1916, the Cross of Chevalier of the French Legion of Honour was conferred upon him &quot;in recognition of valuable services rendered&quot;. and, later the same year, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre.

During 1917, Shaw-Stewart increasingly felt that he was doing very little of any use in Salonika and was missing the comradeship of his friends in the Royal Naval Division. After having several requests to be moved to France turned down, he effectively absconded while on leave in England and rejoined his old battalion in France. 
Promoted to lieutenant commander and in temporary command of the Hood Battalion, he was killed in France on 30 December 1917 while making his way up a sunken road just behind the fire trenches. Stewart was struck in the mouth by a shell fragment and died almost immediately. He is buried at Metz-en-Couture in the British extension to the communal cemetery.

==Work==

His fame today stems from one of his poems, &quot;Achilles in the Trench&quot;, one of the best-known of the war poems of the First World War. It was written while Shaw-Stewart waited to be sent to fight at Gallipoli and was on leave on the island of Imbros, overlooking Hisarlik (the site of the ancient city of Troy), and in the poem, Shaw-Stewart makes numerous references to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, questioning, &quot;Was it so hard, Achilles,/So very hard to die?&quot; In the stanza beginning, &quot;O hell of ships and cities&quot;, he plays on the similarity of &quot;hell&quot; and &quot;Helen&quot;, imitating the similar wordplay in Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Agamemnon&quot; 681–690. In the final stanza, he evokes the image of flame-capped Achilles screaming from the Achaean ramparts after the death of Patroclus and requests that Achilles likewise shout for him during the battle.

==Legacy==
The first biography of Shaw-Stewart, by Ronald Knox, was published in 1920. Elizabeth Vandiver&#x27;s &quot;Stand in the Trench, Achilles&quot; includes a detailed discussion of Shaw-Stewart. A new biography by Miles Jebb was published in May 2010.

A memorial to him was erected at Balliol College, Oxford, on the west wall of the Chapel passage. He is also named on the war memorial in the antechapel at All Souls College, Oxford and on the Knockbain parish war memorial in the county of Ross and Cromarty, Scotland.

<doc id="342651" wikidata="Q7243546" url="?curid=342651" title="Primitive Area">
<text>A Primitive Area is a land designation previously used by the United States Forest Service. Although there are still lands with this title, most are now known as wilderness areas. 
The Forest Service began this new designation in 1929 with the L-20 regulations.

The L-20 regulations defined three types of areas: Natural Area, Experimental Forest and Range, and Primitive Area. The L-20 section on Primitive Area read, &quot;to maintain primitive conditions of transportation, subsistence, habitation, and environment to the fullest degree compatible with their highest public use.&quot; as stated by M. Rupert Cutler, in a briefing before the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives on July 24. 1979.

The US Forest Service, along with preservationist Bob Marshall, continued to add acreage to the fledgling wilderness system. 
 [Marshall&#x27;s] total acreage recommendation to the Forest Service for
 primitive classification was almost three times more than the Service
 was willing or able to set aside. Areas in which the Park Service had
 shown a special interest, however, were almost all formally classified
 as primitive areas—even those under in the West which
 were not of special interest to Marshall.

Stricter regulations for these new protected areas began in 1939 from Bob Marshall&#x27;s efforts. This resulted in the &quot;U-Regulations&quot; as they came to be known.
The U-Regulations superseded the L-20 Regulations and created two types of areas. Regulation U-1 created Wilderness Areas (over 100,000 acres). Regulation U-2 created Wild Areas (5,000 to 100,000 acres). The U Regulations prohibited mechanized access, timber harvesting and road construction in the wilderness and wild areas. 
The U-Regulations replaced the term primitive area with wilderness area and wild area and were used by the Forest Service until the passage of the federal Wilderness Act of 1964.

The Wilderness Act gave federal protection to these US Forest Service administrative areas and created the National Wilderness Preservation System.

<text>Bishop&#x27;s University () is a small English-language liberal arts university in Lennoxville, a borough of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. The founder of the institution was the Anglican Bishop of Quebec, George Mountain, who also served as the first principal of McGill University. It is one of three universities in the province of Quebec that teach primarily in English (the others being McGill University and Concordia University, both in Montreal). It began its foundation by absorbing the Lennoxville Classical School as Bishop&#x27;s College School in the 1840s. The college was formally founded in 1843 and received a royal charter from Queen Victoria in 1853.

It remains one of Canada&#x27;s few primarily undergraduate universities, functioning in the way of an American liberal arts college, and is linked with three others in the Maple League. Established in 1843 as Bishop&#x27;s College, the school used to be affiliated with the University of Oxford in 1853, where many professors at BU were appointed from. The school remained under the Anglican church&#x27;s direction from its founding until 1947. Since that time, the university has been a non-denominational institution. Bishop&#x27;s University has graduated fifteen Rhodes Scholars.

The university shares a campus with its neighbor, Champlain College Lennoxville, an English-language public college.

==History==


Bishop&#x27;s University can trace its roots back to 1836 when Bishop&#x27;s College School, a &quot;Grammar School in connection with the College,&quot; was founded as the Lennoxville Classical School, an independent institute by Rev. Lucius Doolittle and Edward Chapman. The university section, Bishop&#x27;s College was based on the grammar school and established by the Lord Bishop of Québec The Rt. Rev. Dr. George Jehoshaphat Mountain (who also served as the first principal of McGill College) on December 9, 1843, in Lennoxville, Quebec, for the education of members of the Church of England and erected into a university in 1853. The school was founded by Bishop Mountain, the third Anglican bishop of Quebec, as a liberal arts college. In 1845, instruction began, and in 1854, the first degrees were granted.

In 1845, the Reverend Jasper Hume Nicolls, a Fellow of Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford was appointed first principal of Bishop&#x27;s College. In 1853, he and Bishop Mountain obtained the Royal Charter through which the college became a university. He led Bishop&#x27;s for 32 years, through several financial crises.

A faculty of medicine, known as Bishop&#x27;s Medical Faculty, Montreal, was established in Montreal in 1871, and closed in 1905 when it amalgamated with McGill University.

A short-lived Faculty of Law was established in Sherbrooke in 1880, to close in 1888. It granted only fifteen degrees.

In 1922, Bishop&#x27;s College School moved to its new campus on Moulton Hill from the Little Forks at BU as a severe fire happened in 1891. Yet, many connections are remained.

The Church of England controlled the university until 1947. Since 1947, a corporation and appointed trustees have been responsible for its business affairs, and a senate has dealt with academic matters. This bicameral model of governance was based on the 1906 provincial University of Toronto Act, which established a system dividing university government into a senate (faculty) to set academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) to oversee financial policy and other matters.

The president, appointed by the board, was to perform institutional leadership and provide a link between the senate and the board of governors. In the early part of the twentieth century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law, and medicine, while graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced. The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.

On December 9, 1993, a Sesquicentennial Convocation was held in Centennial Theatre. Governor General of Canada Ray Hnatyshyn presented the Coat of Arms and Flag and signed and presented the Letters Patent of Bishop&#x27;s University.

In 2007, enrollment had shrunk by 14 percent and was &quot;falling like a stone,&quot; then-Principal Michael Goldbloom told &quot;The Montreal Gazette&quot; after he was hired in 2008. Furthermore, campus morale was low after a 41-day strike by staff and a lock-out of faculty. The university had a $1.4 million operating deficit and was relying on a $9 million line of credit to remain solvent, prompting rumours that the university would close. By 2010, however, Bishop&#x27;s rebounded as enrollment shot up by 20 percent after new leadership was hired and aggressive student recruitment efforts were instituted. The university&#x27;s finances also improved significantly.

Language officials in Quebec announced in October 2023 that Canadian students from outside Quebec who come to study at a university in the province will pay twice as much in tuition beginning in the fall of 2024. The new policy would disproportionately affect the province&#x27;s three English-language universities. Citing the potential loss of 30% of the student body, Sébastien Lebel-Grenier, Bishop&#x27;s principal and vice-chancellor, told the Montreal Gazette, &quot;That’s more than significant — for Bishop’s, it could mean an existential threat.&quot; The CAQ government announced shortly thereafter that it is looking at various scenarios to maintain the vitality of Bishop&#x27;s as many in the business and political communities have called for an exemption for Bishop&#x27;s. At a news conference on Nov. 24, 2023, Quebec Premier Francois Legault announced that Bishop&#x27;s University will be &quot;exempted&quot; from the proposed tuition hikes for out-of-province students at Quebec&#x27;s universities.

==Academic programs==

Primarily undergraduate, Bishop&#x27;s University also offers graduate courses and M.A. and M.Ed. degrees in education and M.Sc. in computer science and physics. Bishop&#x27;s offers several programs from five academic divisions:
*Williams School of Business
*Division of Humanities

*Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics
*Division of Social Sciences

*School of Education
Each division seeks to provide a well-rounded education for all its students. The average class size as of fall 2017 was 34.7 in first- and second-year courses and 18.9 in upper-year courses. Administratively, the Divisions of Humanities, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and Social Sciences are part of the Faculty of Arts and Science.

In 2004, Bishop&#x27;s joined the Université de Sherbrooke in creating SIXtron, a joint spin-off of technology based in Montreal which is focused on developing highly scalable and cost-effective, amorphous silicon carbide (SiC)-based thin film coatings for the solar industry.

In 2009, the Psychological Health and Well-Being Laboratory was founded as an initiative to produce and share knowledge regarding how to enhance the psychological health and well-being of individuals and the communities that they live in. The research cluster is headed by Dr. Heather Lawford. It is one of four research clusters, the others examining Social and Cultural Identities; climate change; and astrophysics.

As of 2018, Bishop&#x27;s had a total of 2,867 students. The student body represents every Canadian province and territory along with 18 U.S. states and more than 50 countries.

===Williams School of Business===
The Williams School of Business is the business school at Bishop&#x27;s University. It is accredited under the Network of International Business Schools (NIBS) and claims multiple first place victories in international business case competitions. It offers courses through a bachelor of business administration (BBA) or Bachelor of Arts (BA) major in business. A cooperative education program is also offered. Approximately 22% of Bishop&#x27;s University students are enrolled in the Williams School of Business.

The Williams School of Business offers the following concentrations under the BBA:
*Accounting
*Entrepreneurship
*Finance

*Human Resources
*International Business
*Marketing

*General Business Management
==Campus==
The Bishop&#x27;s campus is located on of land at the junction of the Saint Francis and Massawippi rivers in the Eastern Townships region of Quebec and features 25 buildings. The site of Bishop&#x27;s College, a grassy knoll at the confluence of two rivers, provided a natural setting where architecture would be viewed as an integral but subsidiary part of the scenic vista. Known as &#x27;Oxford on the Massawippi&#x27; for its architectural style, the campus is significantly influenced by the Gothic Revival period and is home to some of Quebec&#x27;s most historic buildings, including St. Mark&#x27;s chapel. Construction on campus began with &quot;Old Arts&quot; in 1846 and continues today with the university&#x27;s most recent building, the Library Learning Commons, in 2017. The campus also provided the setting for the films &quot;Lost and Delirious&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Covenant&quot; (2006).
===McGreer Hall===
McGreer Hall is named in honour of Arthur Huffman McGreer (1883–1947), Principal from 1922 to 1947. The original hall was constructed in 1846; the Lodge was added in 1847 as a residence for the Principal. In 1876 the central block was gutted by fire. It was rebuilt, and enlarged in 1898 with the extension of the third floor and the addition of the central tower. In 1909 the Library wing was added.

===Bishop Williams Hall===

Bishop Williams Hall is a lecture and presentation hall originally built in 1891. Funds for its construction were raised by Bishop&#x27;s College School (BCS) old boys, who wanted to mark the 25th anniversary of the consecration of Bishop James William Williams, a former headmaster of the college and 4th Anglican bishop of Québec. The hall was destroyed by fire later the same, and rebuilt in 1892.
===Bandeen Hall===
Bandeen Hall was originally used as a gymnasium for undergraduates and for the boys of Bishop&#x27;s College School. In 1950 the room was converted into a dining-hall for the Norton-Pollack residence complex. After 1971 the room served as the undergraduate Pub, and for a time housed temporary studios for the Fine Arts departments of Champlain College and the university.

In 1990, funds raised by the Learning for Life campaign were used to convert the area into a concert hall; it was named for the late Robert A. Bandeen, a former Chancellor of the university, and his wife, Mona Blair Bandeen.

===Centennial Theatre===
Centennial Theatre opened as a performing arts centre in 1967, with a mandate to provide a theatrical and cultural platform for English-speaking residents in the Eastern Townships. The theatre combines the wide auditorium style of a Greek amphitheatre with an Italian stage house, with proscenium and flies. It has seating for 549.

===Old Library and Archives===

This building was added to McGreer Hall in 1909, and served as the University Library. In the 1970s it was divided into two floors, the wooden ceiling covered by tiles, and became office space. The library wing was restored to its original design in time for the Sesquicentennial celebrations in 1993–1994.

The Old Library houses the collections of the University Archives and the Eastern Townships Research Centre, including books, genealogical information, documents, photographs, postcards, maps, plans, and audio-visual material. The room also hosts lectures, receptions, special events, and quiet study.

The Library Learning Commons—formerly known as the John Bassett Memorial Library prior to extensive renovations completed in 2018—provides study and research support for the students and faculty of both Bishop&#x27;s University and Champlain College, Lennoxville Campus. The present building was built in 1959, and expanded in 1970, 1990, and 2017. The Library&#x27;s holdings are over 598,000 items, including books, microforms, and audio-visual materials, as well as those of the approximately 19,550 periodical titles including online periodicals. Research and study are further supported by collections of Canadian Government documents, and Maps. In-house resources are augmented by an Inter-Library Loan network.

===Art Gallery===
Bishop&#x27;s University houses the Foreman Art Gallery, which exhibits contemporary and historical painting, sculpture, mixed media, installation, video and films by students, faculty, Canadian and international artists. Hung throughout the buildings on campus, the collection consists of 150 works, many by 19th- and 20th-century Canadian artists.

===Nicolls Building===

The Nicolls Building is named in honour of the Reverend Jasper Hume Nicolls. An observatory is located on the roof of the Nicolls building. The observatory houses a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and is also open to the public.

===Old Lennox Golf &amp; Ski===

The Bishop&#x27;s campus uniquely features a golf course and cross-country ski club: The Old Lennox Golf &amp; Ski. The club was founded by the university and was chartered by the Royal Canadian Golf Association in 1897. The course remains one of the oldest in Canada. The club features over 7 km of cross-country ski trails, including about 5 km which are certified by the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS)

===St. Mark&#x27;s Chapel===
St. Mark&#x27;s Chapel was built in the Perpendicular Gothic style, and was consecrated in 1857 by George Jehoshaphat Mountain. It was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1891, and rebuilt on the same site, and fitted with ash furniture, panelling and wood sculptures by the Sherbrooke cabinet-making firm of George Long and his assistant, Georges Bélanger. St. Mark&#x27;s Chapel was declared Cultural Property by the Quebec Ministere des Affaires culturelles in 1989.

==Athletics==
The Bishop&#x27;s University teams are known as the Bishop&#x27;s Gaiters and compete in the U SPORTS, RSEQ, AUS, and CUFLA. Although their logo and mascot suggest the term stems from the word alligator, &quot;Gaiter&quot; actually refers to a leg covering worn by Anglican bishops up until the middle of the 20th century. The Gaiters are represented by seven varsity teams (Football, Men&#x27;s &amp; Women&#x27;s Basketball, Men&#x27;s &amp; Women&#x27;s Rugby, Women&#x27;s Soccer, and Golf) and four club teams (Men&#x27;s Lacrosse, Women&#x27;s Hockey, Men&#x27;s Hockey, Men&#x27;s Soccer). The Bishop&#x27;s Gaiters have a long history with the university. The early days were marked by massive participation in team sports such as cricket and football. Rugby football began in 1888 and Canadian football was a budding varsity sport by the 1930s. The Gaiters football team&#x27;s home stadium is Coulter Field which is also used as a practice facility by the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League.

In football, the Gaiters have made five appearances in CIS semifinal bowls, most recently the 1994 Churchill Bowl. In basketball, the Gaiters won women&#x27;s national championships in 1982-83 and 1983–84 and the men&#x27;s national championship in 1997–98. The 1997-98 men&#x27;s championship team is the last Quebec University men&#x27;s team to win a basketball national title.

As of March 2019, there are three former Bishop&#x27;s football players in the CFL: Adrian Clarke, Stephen Adekolu, and Junior Turner.

==Traditions==

=== School song ===

Bishop&#x27;s official school song, &quot;Alma Mater,&quot; was written in 1937. In 1964, however, the lyrics &quot;Raise a toast to Bishop&#x27;s University&quot; were written by John Piper, Douglas Tees, Ace Henderson and John Martland as part of the musical comedy, &quot;The Grate Escape,&quot; performed by the Bishop&#x27;s choir. The tune stuck and has become the unofficial song of the university. In practice however, the second line of the second verse is changed to a more vulgar and humorous version.

=== The Gait ===
Bishop&#x27;s on-campus bar. Located across from the bookstore in the SUB, the bar has been run for students, by students. Owned and operated by the SRC, it is also a place of employment for around 20 bar staff, multiple student musicians, student DJs, and student security. The Gait also helps students fundraise for student initiative through pizza and/or hot dog sales, photo booths, etc.

=== WinterFest ===
WinterFest is Bishop&#x27;s University&#x27;s largest on-campus event, with approximately 900 attendees in 2019. Since its first edition in 2003, WinterFest has become a yearly tradition. The 2-days outdoor festival is a ski competition, the Rail Jam, as well as a large concert hosted in the Quad at the heart of campus. Shaun Frank, Lost Kings, and Jazz Cartier have performed, as well as guest skiers and snowboarders such as Sébastien Toutant.

=== Orientation Week ===
Orientation Week, also known as Frosh Week, is a week-long event hosted before the first week of classes in the fall, with activities on and off campus for first-year students to get to know campus, Lennoxville, and to meet their classmates.

<text>Great Barrington is a town in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, United States. It is part of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 7,172 at the 2020 census. Both a summer resort and home to Ski Butternut, a ski resort, Great Barrington includes the villages of Van Deusenville and Housatonic.

==History==

===1676–1995===
The Mahican Indians called the area &quot;Mahaiwe&quot;, meaning &quot;the place downstream&quot;. It lay on the New England Path, which connected Fort Orange near Albany, New York, with Springfield and Massachusetts Bay.

The first recorded account of Europeans in the area happened in August 1676, during King Philip&#x27;s War. Major John Talcott and his troops chased a group of 200 Mahican Natives west from Westfield, eventually overtaking them at the Housatonic River in what is now Great Barrington. According to reports at the time, Talcott&#x27;s troops killed twenty-five Indians and imprisoned another twenty. Today, a plaque for John Talcott marks the spot where the massacre is believed to have happened.

On April 25, 1724, Captain John Ashley of Westfield, Massachusetts, bought on behalf of himself and a committee of the Massachusetts General Court the land that became the towns of Great Barrington, Sheffield, Egremont, Alford, Mount Washington, and Boston Corner for £460, three barrels of &quot;sider,&quot; and thirty quarts of rum from 21 Native American sachems headed by Conkepot Poneyote. The Konkapot River in southwestern Massachusetts is named after him.

The village was first settled by colonists in 1726 and from 1742 to 1761 was the north parish of Sheffield. In 1761, it was officially incorporated as Great Barrington, named after the village of Great Barrington in Gloucestershire, England.

In the summer of 1774, local colonists temporarily forced the closure of the Berkshire County Court in response to unpopular British policies. In the winter of 1776, Henry Knox passed through Great Barrington while transporting the &quot;noble train of artillery&quot; from Fort Ticonderoga to the outskirts of Boston during the siege of Boston. Due to his time in the area, he established an agricultural interest in the area of Great Barrington.

With the arrival of the railroad in the late 19th century, Great Barrington developed as a Gilded Age resort community for those seeking relief from the heat and pollution of cities. Wealthy families built grand homes called Berkshire Cottages here, as others would in Lenox and Stockbridge.

Among the earliest estates was one built by New York City banker, industrialist and art patron David Leavitt, who built an elaborate estate, and was soon followed by those of his sons nearby. Leavitt was instrumental in the development of the local Housatonic Railroad, serving as its president.

Later estates included Searles Castle, commissioned in 1888 by the widow of Mark Hopkins together with her second husband, Edward Francis Searles, and &quot;Brookside&quot;, built for William Hall Walker. In 1895, Colonel William L. Brown, part owner of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, presented Great Barrington with a statue of a newsboy, now a landmark on the western edge of town.

====World&#x27;s first alternating current/transformer system====
In November 1885 electrical engineer William Stanley, Jr., a sometime Great Barrington resident working for George Westinghouse, began installing a demonstration transformer based alternating current lighting system. Stanley felt alternating current was an improvement over the direct current system being used by Thomas Edison. Stanley was trying to get Westinghouse to adopt it. Stanley had developed a series transformer he thought would make alternating current practical. He built his components at the &quot;Old Rubber Factory&quot; south of Cottage Street and installed a Westinghouse steam engine powering a 500 volt Siemens generator. Stringing the power lines from tree to tree down the street, in March 1886 Stanley powered the system up and was able to expand it to the point where it could light 23 businesses along Main Street with very little power loss over . Using the new Stanley transformers, at each location, the system&#x27;s 500 volts were stepped down to 100 volts which was used to power incandescent lamps. This was the world&#x27;s first practical demonstration of an alternating current with transformers system. It was the basis of the alternating current systems Westinghouse would begin installing later that year.

====Alice&#x27;s Restaurant====

Arlo Guthrie&#x27;s song &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant,&quot; which runs for minutes, is based on true-life events of the mid-20th century in Great Barrington and the adjoining towns of Stockbridge and Lee. The Old Trinity Church, which was the home of Ray and Alice Brock at the time of these incidents, is now owned by Guthrie, and is at 4 Van Deusenville Road in Great Barrington.

===Recent history===

The town was the site of an F4 tornado around 7:00 pm on Memorial Day, May 29, 1995. The tornado killed three people and caused damage in the area.

On July 24, 2009, Great Barrington was named an Appalachian Trail Community by application and acceptance by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.

On June 1, 2010, a new fire station was opened for the Great Barrington Fire Department, located on Route 7. The new fire station replaced the old one, on Castle Street. It had deteriorated and was too small for the growing needs of the fire department. The new $9.1 million facility was planned as a center for community events such as elections. It serves as the hub for emergency operations in southern Berkshire County.

The town celebrated its 250th anniversary with a large parade on July 10, 2011. Other events celebrating the 250th anniversary were held throughout the year as well.

The &quot;&quot; was launched in 2011, involving major improvements along Main Street between Saint James Place and Cottage Street. The plan elements include new pavement, new sidewalks, sewer and utility improvements, and the removal of the large pear trees that span Main Street, to be replaced with a much wider array of trees of varying sizes and growth habits. The project had finished its design phase as of 2012, and construction was to be completed in 2016.

In 2023 the town made national news after plainclothes police conducted a search of the WEB DuBois Regional Middle School based on an anonymous tip that someone in the school possessed a copy of the book Gender Queer: A Memoir.

The Appalachian Trail crosses through East Mountain State Forest in the southeast corner of town. The southwest corner of town is the site of several country clubs and a fairgrounds.

U.S. Route 7 passes through the center of town, and was once part of New England Interstate Route 4 (also known as the New York-Berkshire-Burlington Way). Massachusetts Route 23 passes from west to east through town, combining with Massachusetts Route 41 and U.S. Route 7 in the western part of town and Massachusetts Route 183 in the eastern part of town, which also follows part of the path of Route 7 northward from Route 23 before splitting towards the village of Housatonic. Great Barrington is approximately south of Exit 2 of Interstate 90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike), the nearest interstate highway.

<text>Raymond Herbert Asquith (6 November 1878 – 15 September 1916) was an English barrister and eldest son of British prime minister H. H. Asquith. A distinguished Oxford scholar, he was a member of the fashionable group of intellectuals known as the Coterie, which included, Lady Diana Manners (with whom he had a long flirtatious relationship), Patrick Shaw-Stewart, Charles Lister, Hugo &quot;Ego&quot; Charteris, Julian Grenfell and Edward Horner. The Coterie were notable for their unconventional lifestyles and lavish hospitality. Like several of them, Asquith was killed in action in the First World War during his father&#x27;s term in office.

== Career and honours ==
Asquith was the eldest son of British prime minister H. H. Asquith (1852-1928) by his first wife, Helen Kelsall Melland (1854-1891).

He was educated at Winchester, from where he won a scholarship to Balliol in 1896, taking with him a reputation for brilliance. He won the Ireland, Derby, and Craven scholarships, and graduated with first-class honours. Elected a fellow of All Souls in 1902, he received the Eldon Law Scholarship, and was called to the bar in 1904. The tall, handsome Asquith was a member of the Coterie, a group of Edwardian socialites and intellectuals.

Asquith was junior counsel in the North Atlantic Fisheries Arbitration and the British Wreck Commissioner&#x27;s inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and was considered a putative Liberal candidate for Derby. However, his rise was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War. He was initially commissioned, on 17 December 1914, as a second lieutenant into the 16th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Queen&#x27;s Westminster Rifles). He was transferred to the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards on 14 August 1915, and assigned as a staff officer, but he requested to be returned to active duty with his battalion, a request granted before the Battle of the Somme.

While leading the first half of 4 Company in an attack near Ginchy on 15 September 1916, at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, he was shot in the chest but famously lit a cigarette to hide the seriousness of his injuries so that his men would continue the attack, being shot at 16:30 pm. He died whilst being carried back to British lines. His body was buried at Guillemont in the CWGC Guillemont Road Cemetery (Plot I. Row B. Grave 3.). The grave&#x27;s headstone is inscribed: &#x27;Small time but in that small most greatly lived this star of England&#x27;, a concluding line from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;.

In his 1928 obituary tribute to H.H. Asquith, Winston Churchill summarised Asquith&#x27;s last moments:

&quot;It seemed quite easy for Raymond Asquith, when the time came, to face death and to die. When I saw him at the Front he seemed to move through the cold, squalor and peril of the winter trenches as if he were above and immune from the common ills of the flesh, a being clad in polished armour, entirely undisturbed, presumably invulnerable. The War which found the measure of so many, never got to the bottom of him, and when the Grenadiers strode into the crash and thunder of the Somme, he went to his fate cool, poised, resolute, matter of fact, debonair. And well we know that his father, then bearing the supreme burden of the State, would proudly have marched at his side&quot;

The writer John Buchan devoted several pages of his autobiography &quot;Memory Hold-the-Door&quot; to his friendship with Asquith. He noted of Raymond&#x27;s character:

&quot;I do not think he could ever have been called popular. He was immensely admired, but he did not lay himself out to acquire popularity, and in the ordinary man he inspired awe rather than liking. His courtesy was without warmth, he was apt to be intolerant of mediocrity, and he had no desire for facile acquaintanceships. Also – let it be admitted – there were times when he was almost inhuman. He would destroy some piece of honest sentiment with a jest, and he had no respect for the sacred places of dull men. There was always a touch of scorn in him for obvious emotions, obvious creeds, and all the accumulated lumber of prosaic humanity. That was a defect of his great qualities. He kept himself for his friends and refused to bother about the world. But as such who were to his friendship he would deny nothing. I have never known a friend more considerate, and tender, and painstaking, and unfalteringly loyal. It was the relation of all others in life for which he had been born with a peculiar genius.&quot;

Buchan&#x27;s analysis of Asquith&#x27;s personality is endorsed by several other contemporaries who found him clever but rather arrogant, cold, cynical and aloof.
=== Memorials ===
A memorial tablet to Asquith&#x27;s memory was erected in Amiens Cathedral. The inscription, in French and Latin, states: Priez pour l&#x27;âme de RAYMOND ASQUITH Lieutenant aux Grenadiers de la Garde Royale. Fils ainé de Herbert Henry Asquith premier ministre du Royaume Uni. Né le 6 Nov. 1878. Tombé au champ d&#x27;honneur près de Guinchy le 15 Sept. 1916. [&quot;Pray for the soul of RAYMOND ASQUITH Lieutenant of the Grenadiers of the Royal Guard. Eldest son of Herbert Henry Asquith, prime minister of the United Kingdom. Born Nov. 6 1878. Fell on the field of honour near Guinchy Sept. 15 1916.&quot;]O ORIENS SPLENDOR LUCIS AETERNAE VENI ET ILLUMINA SEDENTES IN TENEBRIS ET UMBRA MORTIS. Gloriae memor posuit conjux. [&quot;O dawn of the east, brightness of light eternal, and sun of justice: come, and enlighten those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death.&quot;] He is also the subject of a memorial in St Andrew&#x27;s Church near the family home in Mells in Somerset, and is listed on Mells War Memorial; both memorials were designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, a friend of the Asquith family.

The St Andrew&#x27;s Church memorial wording is:&quot;In piam memoriam Raymondi Asquith Coll. Wintoniensis et Balliolensis scholaris Coll. Omnium Animarum socii qui in foro et republica ad omnia ingenii virtutisque praemia spe et votis aequalium destinatus medio in flore aetatis armis pro patria sumptis fortiter pugnans occidit defunctum terra tenet longinqua et amica desiderio inexpleto prosequuntur sui&quot;N. VI NOV. MDCCCLXXVIII OB. XV SEPT. MCMXVI

In English the text reads:In loving memory of Raymond Asquith Scholar of Winchester College and Balliol College Fellow of All Souls College Who was destined by the hopes and desires of his contemporaries To win all the rewards of intellectual talent and virtue. In the middle of the flower of his life He took up arms for his native-land and died fighting bravely. A distant and friendly land holds him now he is dead. His family and friends mourn him with unrequited longing. Born on 6 November 1878, died on 15 September 1916.

Asquith and his wife Katharine are portrayed in Phoebe Traquair&#x27;s apse mural in All Saints Church, at Thorney Hill, he also appears in William Rothenstein&#x27;s unfinished mural &quot;War Cartoon&quot; located at the University of Southampton.

== Family ==

Raymond Asquith was married on 25 July 1907 to Katharine Frances Horner (1885–1976), younger daughter of Sir John Francis Fortescue Horner, of Mells, Somerset, descended from Thomas Horner, the Tudor figure on whom the nursery rhyme &#x27;Little Jack Horner&#x27; is sometimes said to be based. Her mother, Lady Horner (d. 1940), was Frances Jane Graham, elder daughter of William Graham, a rich merchant, passionate art collector, and Liberal member of parliament for Glasgow. Lady Horner was a notable hostess and patron of the arts, especially the Pre-Raphaelites and John Singer Sargent. The Horners had four children – Cicely (born 1883), Katharine (1885), Mark (who died in his teens), and Edward (1888).

Asquith and his wife had three children:
*Lady Helen Frances Asquith OBE (1908–2000), a school teacher and inspector who died unmarried
*Perdita Rose Mary Jolliffe, Baroness Hylton (nee Asquith) (1910–1996) who married the 4th Baron Hylton (d 1967)
*Julian Edward George Asquith, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Asquith, KCMG (1916–2011), nicknamed Trim, who was born a few months before his father&#x27;s death on active service. The new baby was reputedly named &quot;Trim&quot; in honour of the Roman gourmand Trimalchio, after his father saw his newborn son for the first time while on leave from the war.

Asquith died nearly ten years before his father was raised to the House of Lords in 1925 as Earl of Oxford and Asquith. Katharine eventually inherited Mells Manor because her younger and only surviving brother, Edward Horner (1888–1917), was also killed in the war. He was buried in France, but his memorial in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Mells was designed by his mother&#x27;s friend Edwin Lutyens, who was a patron of Monsignor Ronald Knox. Katharine converted to Roman Catholicism after being widowed and became a friend of Siegfried Sassoon, who also converted, following her example. She also remained in touch with Evelyn Waugh, another convert. All three of her children were brought up as Roman Catholics.

<text>Seven generation stewardship is a concept that urges the current generation of humans to live and work for the benefit of the seventh generation into the future.
It is believed to have originated with the Great Law of the Iroquois – which holds appropriate to think seven generations ahead and decide whether the decisions they make today would benefit their descendants. It is frequently associated with the modern, popular concept of environmental stewardship or &#x27;sustainability&#x27; but it is much broader in context.

==Iroquois Constitution==
&quot;In every deliberation, we must consider the impact on the seventh generation... even if it requires having skin as thick as the bark of a pine.&quot; Is often attributed to the Great Peacemaker. This is an often repeated saying; however, it is not contained in written transcriptions of the Constitution of the Iroquois Nation.
The Great Law of Peace is an oral constitution passed on by member nations, comprising an oral history passed on by elders.

The only passage from the text mentioning the number seven talks about qualities that Iroquois leaders should have, while the end of the passage advises them to consider the welfare of future generations. In law 28 of the Constitution of the Iroquois Nation,We now do crown you with the sacred emblem of the deer&#x27;s antlers, the emblem of your Lordship. You shall now become a mentor of the people of the Five Nations. &quot;The thickness of your skin shall be seven spans&quot; — which is to say that you shall be proof against anger, offensive actions, and criticism. [...] &quot;Look and listen for the welfare of the whole people and have always in view not only the present but also the coming generations&quot;, even those whose faces are yet beneath the surface of the ground -- the unborn of the future Nation.Oren Lyons, Chief of the Onondaga Nation, writes: &quot;We are looking ahead, as is one of the first mandates given us as chiefs, to make sure and to make every decision that we make relate to the welfare and well-being of the seventh generation to come. ... What about the seventh generation? Where are you taking them? What will they have?&quot;

==Principle==
In reaction to consumerism, another interpretation that stresses stewardship owed to generations past and future sometimes arises in popular culture and discourse. Rather than pointing to seven generations counted from one&#x27;s own and looking toward the future, there is an awareness of a legacy to honor or a debt to bear in mind to those three generations before one&#x27;s own, as well as an awareness of one&#x27;s own legacy bequeathed to the three generations to follow one&#x27;s own. By reckoning 25 years per generation, the span of lifetimes stretches 75 years before one&#x27;s birth and 75 years beyond one&#x27;s death.

A variation on the seven generation thinking where self is placed at the center is to expand the span of years that touches one&#x27;s own lifetime. One such variation was proffered by Quaker sociologist Elise M. Boulding. According to this perspective, a person takes into account the oldest relative or family friend who touched or knew the person as an infant; for example, a great-great-grandparent of age 90. In the same way, the person should then consider the oldest relative or family friend who touched or knew that great-great-grandparent; for example, another 90-year-old person. Then the calculation runs forward to the infant whom the person might touch or know during his or her own lifetime; and by extension again, estimate the number of years when that infant might grow to old age and touch or know still another infant. In total this reaching into the past 180 years and into the future 180 results in the widest frame for understanding one&#x27;s place in the 360 year period over which one may be known and may know others. In other words, the fact of one&#x27;s own existence materially touches this very wide span of time.
