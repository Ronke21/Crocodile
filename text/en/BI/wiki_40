<text>Mary Ann Camberton Shadd Cary (October 9, 1823 – June 5, 1893) was an American-Canadian anti-slavery activist, journalist, publisher, teacher, and lawyer. She was the first black woman publisher in North America and the first woman publisher in Canada. She was also the second black woman to attend law school in the United States. Mary Shadd established the newspaper &quot;Provincial Freeman&quot; in 1853, which was published weekly in southern Ontario. it advocated equality, integration, and self-education for black people in Canada and the United States.

Mary&#x27;s family was involved in the Underground Railroad, assisting those fleeing slavery in the United States. After the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, her family relocated to what is today southern Ontario (then the western part of the United Canadas). She returned to the United States during the American Civil War, where she recruited soldiers for the Union. Self-taught, Mary went to Howard University Law School, and continued advocacy for civil rights for African Americans and women for the rest of her life.

==Early life==
Mary Ann Shadd was born in Wilmington, Delaware, on October 9, 1823, the eldest of 13 children to Abraham Doras Shadd (1801–1882) and Harriet Burton Parnell, who were free African Americans. Abraham D. Shadd was a grandson of Hans Schad, alias John Shadd, a native of Hesse-Cassel who had entered the United States serving as a Hessian soldier with the British Army during the French and Indian War. Hans Schad was wounded and left in the care of two African-American women, a mother and daughter, both named Elizabeth Jackson. The Hessian soldier and the daughter were married in January 1756 and their first son was born six months later.

A. D. Shadd was the son of Jeremiah Shadd, John&#x27;s younger son, who was a Wilmington butcher. Abraham Shadd was trained as a shoemaker and had a shop in Wilmington and later in the nearby town of West Chester, Pennsylvania. In both places he was active as a conductor on the Underground Railroad and in other civil rights activities, being an active member of the American Anti-Slavery Society, and, in 1833, named President of the National Convention for the Improvement of Free People of Colour in Philadelphia.

Growing up, her family&#x27;s home frequently served as a refuge for fugitive slaves; however, when it became illegal to educate African-American children in the state of Delaware, the Shadd family moved to Pennsylvania, where Mary attended a Quaker Boarding School (despite being raised Catholic). In 1840, Shadd returned to East Chester and established a school for black children. She also later taught in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and New York City.

Three years after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, A. D. Shadd moved his family to the United Canadas (Canada West), settling in North Buxton, Ontario. In 1858, he became one of the first black men to be elected to political office in Canada, when he was elected to the position of Counsellor of Raleigh Township, Ontario.

==Social activism==
In 1848, Frederick Douglass asked readers in his newspaper, &quot; The North Star&quot;, to offer their suggestions on what could be done to improve life for African Americans. Shadd, then 25 years of age, wrote to him to say, &quot;We should do more and talk less.&quot; She expressed her frustration with the many conventions that had been held to that date, such as those attended by her father, where speeches were made and resolutions passed about the evils of slavery and the need for justice for African Americans. Yet little tangible improvement had resulted. Douglass published her letter in his paper.

When the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 in the United States threatened to return free Northern blacks and escaped slaves into bondage, Shadd and her brother Isaac Shadd moved to Canada, and settled in Windsor, Ontario, across the border from Detroit, where Shadd&#x27;s efforts to create free black settlements in Canada first began.

While in Windsor, she founded a &quot;racially&quot; integrated school with the support of the American Missionary Association. Public education in Ontario was not open to black students at the time. Shadd offered daytime classes for children and youth, and evening classes for adults.

An advocate for emigration, in 1852, Shadd published a pamphlet entitled &quot;A Plea for Emigration; or Notes of Canada West, in Its Moral, Social and Political Aspect: with Suggestions respecting Mexico, West Indies and Vancouver&#x27;s Island for the Information of Colored Emigrants.&quot; The pamphlet discussed the benefits of emigration, as well as the opportunities for blacks in the area.

== &quot;The Provincial Freeman&quot; ==
In 1853, Shadd founded an anti-slavery newspaper, called &quot; The&quot; &quot;Provincial Freeman&quot;&quot;.&quot; The paper&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Devoted to antislavery, temperance and general literature.&quot; It was published weekly and the first issue was published in Toronto, Ontario, on March 24, 1853. It ran for four years before financial challenges ended its publication.

Shadd was aware that her female name would repel some readers, because of the gender expectations of 19th-century society. Therefore, she persuaded Samuel Ringgold Ward, a black abolitionist who published several abolitionist newspapers, including &quot;Impartial Citizen,&quot; to help her publish it. She also enlisted the help of Rev. Alexander McArthur, a white clergyman. Their names were featured on the masthead, but Shadd was involved in all aspects of the paper.

Her brother Isaac Shadd managed the daily business affairs of the newspaper. Isaac was also a committed abolitionist, and would later host gatherings to plan the raid on Harper&#x27;s Ferry at his home.

Shadd traveled widely in Canada and the United States to increase subscription to the paper, and to publicly solicit aid for runaway slaves. Because of the Fugitive Slave Act, these trips included significant risk to Shadd&#x27;s safety; free blacks could be captured by bounty hunters seeking escaped slaves.

As was typical in the black press, &quot;The Provincial Freeman&quot; played an important role by giving voice to the opinions of black Canadian anti-slavery activists.

The impact of African-American newspapers from 1850 to 1860 was significant in the abolitionist movement. However, it was challenging to sustain publication. Publishers like Shadd undertook their work because of a commitment to education and advocacy and used their newspapers as a means to influence opinion. They had to overcome financial, political, and social challenges to keep their papers afloat.

Carol B. Conaway writes in &quot;Racial Uplift: The Nineteenth Century Thought of Black Newspaper Publisher Mary Ann Shadd Cary&quot; that these newspapers shifted the focus from whites to blacks in an empowering way. She writes that whites read these newspapers to monitor the level of dissatisfaction among African Americans and to measure their tolerance for continued slavery in America.

Black newspapers often modeled their newspapers on mainstream white publications. According to research conducted by William David Sloan in his various historical textbooks, the first newspapers were about four pages and had one blank page to provide a place for people to write their own information before passing it along to friends and relatives. He also discussed how the newspapers during these early days were the center of information for society and culture.

In 1854, Shadd changed the masthead to feature her own name, rather than those of McArthur and Ward. She also hired her sister to help edit the paper. There was intense criticism of the change, and Shadd was forced to resign the following year.

==Civil War and postbellum activism==

Between 1855 and 1856, Shadd traveled in the United States as an anti-slavery speaker, advocating for full racial integration through education and self-reliance. In her speeches, she advised all blacks to insist on fair treatment, and to take legal action if necessary.

Shadd sought to participate in the 1855 Philadelphia Colored Convention, but women had never been permitted to attend, and the assembly had to debate whether to let her sit as a delegate. Her advocacy of emigration made her a controversial figure and she was only admitted by a slim margin of 15 votes. According to Frederick Douglass&#x27;s Paper, although she gave a speech at the Convention advocating for emigration, she was so well-received that the delegates voted to give her ten more minutes to speak. However, her presence at the convention was largely elided from the minutes, likely because she was a woman.

In 1856, she married Thomas F. Cary, a Toronto barber who was also involved with the &quot;Provincial Freeman&quot;. They had a daughter named Sarah and a son named Linton.

In 1858, Shadd was a member of the Chatham Vigilance Committee that sought to prevent former slaves from being returned to the United States and brought back into slavery, such as in the case of Sylvanus Demarest.

After her husband died in 1860, Shadd Cary and her children returned to the United States. During the American Civil War, at the behest of the abolitionist Martin Delany, she served as a recruiting officer to enlist black volunteers for the Union Army in the state of Indiana.

After the Civil War, she taught in black schools in Wilmington. She then returned to Washington, D.C., with her daughter, and taught for fifteen years in the public schools. She then attended Howard University School of Law and graduated at the age of 60 in 1883, becoming the second black woman in the United States to earn a law degree.

She wrote for the newspapers &quot;National Era&quot; and &quot;The People&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, and in 1880, organized the Colored Women&#x27;s Progressive Franchise.

Shadd Cary joined the National Woman Suffrage Association, working alongside Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton to advocate for women&#x27;s suffrage, testifying before the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives.

She died in Washington, D.C., on June 5, 1893, from stomach cancer. She was interred at Columbian Harmony Cemetery.

==Legacy and More Information==
In the United States, Shadd Cary&#x27;s former residence in the U Street Corridor of Washington, DC, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. In 1987 she was designated a Women&#x27;s History Month Honoree by the National Women&#x27;s History Project. In 1998, Shadd Cary was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In Canada, she was designated a Person of National Historic Significance, with a plaque from the National Historic Sites and Monuments Board placed in Chatham, Ontario. There, at BME Freedom Park, Ontario provincial plaques also honor her and her newspaper, The Provincial Freeman. In Toronto, a Heritage Toronto plaque marks where she published the Provincial Freeman while living in the city from 1854 to 1855.

Shadd Cary is featured in Canada&#x27;s citizenship test study guide, released in 2009.

Mary Ann Shadd broke barriers in 1853 when she founded &quot;The Provincial Freeman&quot;, publishing papers advocating for abolition, racial equality, and self-reliance. Based in Canada West (modern-day Ontario), it served the growing Black community, particularly those who had fled slavery in the U.S. Shadd managed the editorial duties, financial challenges, and distribution—tasks uncommon for women, especially Black women, at the time. In her early writings, Shadd often signed her work as &quot;A Colored Lady&quot; to obscure her identity. This allowed her ideas to be judged on merit, rather than being dismissed due to her race or gender.

Her articles promoted education, hard work, and independence over reliance on charity. She also used the paper to challenge racism and discrimination, both in Canada and the U.S., showcasing her bold activism.

To sustain &quot;The Provincial Freeman&quot;, Shadd often raised funds creatively, such as organizing benefit events and lectures. She sometimes wrote to wealthy abolitionists, securing support to keep her paper alive

Shadd often wrote anonymously or used pseudonyms, especially in male-dominated spaces like abolitionist newspapers. This allowed her to voice radical ideas without being dismissed due to her gender. When she did speak openly, her outspoken nature drew criticism, even from fellow abolitionists, as her assertiveness defied expectations for women.

Mary Shadd worked with many individuals regarding political injustice. Although, she and Frederick Douglass shared abolitionist goals, Shadd openly criticized his approach. She believed Douglass focused too much on slavery in the U.S., while neglecting solutions like emigration and self-reliance. This caused tensions between the two, as Douglass viewed her criticism as overly harsh. Causing their relationship to be strained.

Shadd was a leading voice encouraging African Americans to move to Canada after the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. This law endangered free and escaped Black people in the U.S., making Canada a safer haven. Her pamphlet, &quot;A Plea for Emigration; or, Notes of Canada West&quot;, detailed Canada’s opportunities, highlighting its free land, relatively equal treatment, and safety from slavery.

Her advocacy helped establish vibrant Black communities in Canada, such as the Dawn Settlement and Buxton Mission. 

Mary Ann’s parents, Abraham and Harriet Shadd, were prominent abolitionists and part of the Underground Railroad. Her father served as a conductor, hosting fugitives in their Delaware home. This early exposure to activism deeply influenced Mary Ann’s commitment to social justice.

At the age of 60, Shadd graduated from Howard University’s law school in 1883, becoming one of the first Black women in the U.S. to achieve this milestone. This was especially significant at a time when very few women, let alone Black women, could access higher education. Her legal knowledge bolstered her activism, particularly in fighting for civil rights and women’s suffrage.

Shadd was deeply committed to education and taught Black and white students alike in the U.S. and Canada. Before moving to Canada, she established a school for Black children in Wilmington, Delaware. In Canada, she opened another school for children of fugitive slaves. Shadd believed education was the key to empowerment and integration. Shadd opened one of the first integrated schools in Canada West. Unlike many Black educators of the time, she believed in breaking racial barriers in education, advocating for schools that accepted students of all races, despite opposition from segregationists.

During the Civil War, Shadd became a recruitment agent for the Union Army. She urged African Americans to enlist, arguing that participation in the war was essential to securing their freedom and proving their loyalty to the U.S. Her efforts contributed to the formation of Black regiments like the famous 54th Massachusetts Infantry.

After the Civil War, Shadd returned to the U.S., but faced challenges in Detroit due to her outspoken nature. She worked briefly as a teacher there but encountered fierce racism and eventually relocated to Washington, D.C., to pursue her law degree.

Shadd’s 1852 pamphlet, &quot;A Plea for Emigration&quot;, was both a practical guide and a rallying cry. It offered detailed information on how to settle in Canada West and provided testimonials from Black settlers. She argued that Black people could thrive in Canada if they worked hard and stayed self-reliant, positioning migration as an act of resistance against systemic oppression in the U.S.

In 1855, Shadd became the first Black woman to speak at a North American National Negro Convention. Her speech emphasized education and self-reliance as tools for Black liberation, defying conventions of the time that excluded women from leadership roles.

Even in her later years, Shadd remained a tireless advocate for civil and women’s rights. She aligned herself with the women’s suffrage movement, speaking publicly and writing extensively on the need for gender equality. Her activism spanned decades, culminating in her recognition as a pioneer in the fight for racial and gender justice. Shadd worked alongside notable suffragists like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Though less well-known, she was one of the first Black women to publicly link racial justice with gender equality, paving the way for intersectional feminism.

Mary Ann Shadd’s boldness, intellect, and activism made her a trailblazer in multiple fields—journalism, education, law, and civil rights. Though she faced immense challenges as a Black woman in the 19th century, her work laid foundations for future generations fighting for equality and justice. Today, she is celebrated as one of Canada’s greatest abolitionists and an enduring symbol of resilience.

Despite her incredible legacy, Shadd was buried in an unmarked grave in Washington, D.C., after her death in 1893. It wasn’t until the late 20th century that her contributions were formally recognized and her grave marked.

Mary Ann Shadd’s life was filled with pioneering achievements, quiet resistance, and relentless advocacy, making her one of the most remarkable, yet underappreciated, figures of the 19th century.

Shadd&#x27;s 197th birthday was observed with a Google Doodle on October 9, 2020, appearing across Canada, the United States, Latvia, Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa.

The Mary Ann Shadd Cary Post Office, named that in 2021, is at 500 Delaware Avenue, Suite 1, in Wilmington, Delaware.

On May 12, 2022, the University of Windsor in Ontario, Canada unveiled a bronze statue of Mary Ann Shadd Cary created by local artist Donna Mayne. Members of the Shadd family and descendants attended the unveiling.

Shadd is featured on a Canadian postal stamp issued January 29, 2024. The stamp is part of Canada&#x27;s Black Heritage Month stamp series.

== Archives ==
The Mary Ann Shadd Cary fonds (F 1409) at the Archives of Ontario is one of the few surviving collections created by Mary Ann Shadd Cary that is held by an archival institution. It is the most comprehensive set of records available. It provides a unique and substantive viewpoint of Shadd Cary&#x27;s work on the international anti-slavery movement. The materials offer insight into the years she lived in Canada West (now Ontario) between 1851 and 1863. The fonds consists of letters received by and written by Mary Ann Shadd Cary during her time living in present-day Ontario. It also includes business records and lecture notes, as well as copies of articles written by Shadd Cary on topics such as supporting integrated schools, fighting segregation, and the political stance taken by &quot;Provincial Freeman&quot; editorial staff. Included is correspondence between members of Shadd Cary&#x27;s family, including her husband Thomas Cary and her brother Isaac Shadd, as well as correspondence with prominent African-American abolitionists William Still, H. Ford Douglas, and Rev. Samuel Ringgold Ward, among others.

The records were acquired from Ed and Maxine Robbins. In 1974, they discovered the records following the demolition of an old building on their property that had once served as Shadd Cary&#x27;s home in Chatham, Ontario. The materials were saved from the resulting rubble. The records were left in the home when Shadd Cary returned to the United States. After the discovery, the material was loaned to the Archives of Ontario in 1986 for microfilming. The records were also cleaned and treated to repair damage. The original records were returned to the Robbins family and remained in their custody until 2022 when they were donated to the archives. This material is available on self-serve microfilm MS 483.

These records were transcribed on February 14, 2023, as part of Douglass Day. Initiated by the Colored Conventions Project, Douglass Day is an annual celebration that commemorates Frederick Douglass&#x27; birthday and Black History Month with a transcribe-a-thon. Douglass Day 2023 was launched with the Archives of Ontario as a primary partner. The focus of Douglas Day 2023 was the transcription and enrichment of newly-digitized collections from Mary Ann Shadd Cary.

The Library and Archives Canada holds the Mary Ann Shadd Cary collection. The archival reference number is R4182-0-X-E, former archival reference number MG24-K22. The collection covers the date range 1852 to 1889. It comprises 1.6 centimetres of textual records, which consists of personal and professional correspondence, various notes about her life, and copies of her works as an abolitionist. The collection also includes Shadd Cary&#x27;s original passport and Naturalization Certificate as well as a black and white portrait photograph of her, the only known one of Shadd Cary that exists.

<doc id="345780" wikidata="Q4839662" url="?curid=345780" title="Backhaul (broadcasting)">
<text>In the context of broadcasting, backhaul refers to uncut program content that is transmitted point-to-point to an individual television station or radio station, broadcast network or other receiving entity where it will be integrated into a finished TV show or radio show. The term is independent of the medium being used to send the backhaul, but communications satellite transmission is very common. When the medium is satellite, it is called a wildfeed.

Backhauls are also referred to sometimes as &quot;clean feeds&quot;, being &quot;clean&quot; in the sense that they lack any of the post-production elements that are added later to the feed&#x27;s content (i.e. on-screen graphics, voice-overs, bumpers, etc.) during the integration of the backhaul feed into a finished show. In live sports production, a backhaul is used to obtain live game footage (usually for later repackaging in highlights shows) when an off-air source is not readily available. In this instance the feed that is being obtained contains all elements except for TV commercials or radio ads run by the host network&#x27;s master control. This is particularly useful for obtaining live coverage of post-game press conferences or extended game highlights (&quot;melts&quot;), since the backhaul may stay up to feed these events after the network has concluded their broadcast.

Electronic news gathering, including &quot;live via satellite&quot; interviews, reporters&#x27; live shots, and sporting events are all examples of radio or television content that is backhauled to a station or network before being made available to the public through that station or network. Cable TV channels, particularly public, educational, and government access (PEG) along with (local origination) channels, may also backhauled to cable headends before making their way to the subscriber. Finished network feeds are not considered backhauls, even if local insertion is used to modify the content prior to final transmission.

There exists a dedicated group of enthusiasts who use TVRO (TV receive-only) gear such as satellite dishes to peek in on backhaul signals that are available on any of the dozens of broadcast satellites that are visible from almost any point on Earth. In its early days, their hobby was strengthened by the fact that most backhaul was analog and &quot;in the clear&quot; (unscrambled or unencrypted) which made for a vast smorgasbord of free television available for the technically inclined amateur. In recent years, full-time content and cable channels have added encryption and conditional access, and occasional signals are steadily becoming digital, which has had a deleterious effect on the hobby.

Some digital signals remain freely accessible (sometimes using Ku band dishes as small as one meter) under the international DVB-S standard or the US Motorola-proprietary Digicipher system. The small dishes may either be fixed (much like DBS antennas), positioned using a rotor (usually DiSEqC-standard) or may be toroidal in design (twin toroidal reflectors focus the incoming signal as a line, not a point, so that multiple LNBs may receive signal from multiple satellites). A &quot;blind-search&quot; receiver is often used to try every possible combination of frequency and bitrate to search for backhaul signals on individual communication satellites.

==Documentaries containing backhauled content==
The 1992 documentary &quot;Feed&quot; was compiled almost entirely using unedited backhaul from political campaign coverage by local and network television. A similar documentary about the 1992 U.S. presidential election named &quot;Spin&quot; was made in the same way in 1995.

<text>Jehan de Lescurel (; also Jehannot de l&#x27;Escurel) was a composer-poet of late medieval music. Jehan&#x27;s extensive surviving &quot;oeuvre&quot; is an important and rare examples of the &quot;formes fixes&quot; before the time of Guillaume de Machaut; it consists of 34 works: 20 ballades, 12 rondeaus and two long narrative poems, &quot;diz entés&quot;. All but one of his compositions is monophonic, representing the end of the &quot;trouvère&quot; tradition and the beginning of the polyphonic &quot;ars nova&quot; style centered around the &quot;formes fixes&quot;. 
==Identity and career==
Jehan de Lescurel is also known as Jehannot de l&#x27;Escurel. Very little is known of his life; the transmission, notation and circumstances of his works suggest he was active in the early 14th century, and his compositions&#x27;s textual references indicate he was active in Paris. It has also been inferred that Jehan was the son of a merchant and probably received his musical training at the Notre Dame de Paris. For many years, scholars assumed he was the &#x27;Jehan de Lescurel&#x27; who had been hung on 23 May 1304 along with three other young clerics of Notre Dame, including Oudinet Pisdoé, for &quot;debauchery&quot; and &quot;crimes against women&quot;. Recent research has shown that &quot;Jehan de Lescurel&quot; was a rather common name in early fourteenth-century Paris, and there is no other clear link between the composer and cleric.

==Music==
He was a transitional figure from the trouvère period to the . His lyrical style unites him with the composers of the later period. The sole source for his music is the same manuscript (Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS français 146) which preserves the interpolated version of the &quot;Roman de Fauvel&quot;.

Most of his works are monophonic songs, in the style of the trouvères; only one of his 34 works is polyphonic, although he wrote other works which have not survived. The songs are virelais, ballades, rondeaux; they include word painting more in the style of the later 14th-century composers than those of the 13th century; they are simple, charming, and debauchery is not a prominent theme. Jehan also has two extant &quot;diz entés&quot;, lengthy poems with music set only to the refrain text.

<doc id="345789" wikidata="Q464405" url="?curid=345789" title="Claude-Étienne Michel">
<text>General Claude-Étienne Michel (3 October 1772 – 18 June 1815), an officer in Napoleon&#x27;s army, eventually rose to second in command of the Chasseur Division of the Imperial Guard and commander of the Brigade of the Middle Guard. He may actually be the officer who uttered the words often attributed to Pierre Cambronne &quot;La Garde meurt et ne se rend pas&quot; &quot;The Guard dies, and does not surrender&quot;.

==Life==
Michel was born in Pointre in the Jura, the son of a surgeon.

== Revolutionary Wars ==
During the French Revolution and the surrounding War of the First Coalition he enlisted in the &#x27;6th battalion of volunteers from the Jura department&#x27; on 1 October 1791. He was a Sergeant Major by the 15th of the month and promoted to Sous-Lieutenant on March 4, 1792. 
then Lieutenant on the 22 August 1792, and was made a Captain on October 6, 1792 a rapid rise in a year. During this year he was deployed on the borders of Switzerland; The 6th Jura Volunteers were moved to the army of the Rhine and Michel was taken prisoner by the Prussians on March 5, 1793 at Rheindürkheim.

Michel was held for over two years and finally exchanged in June 1795. Meanwhile the 6th Jura Volunteers along with the old Royal Army&#x27;s 2nd Battalion of the 96th Regiment and 1st Haute-Vienne volunteers was formed into the 174th Demi-Brigade in October 1793 during a major overhaul of the revolutionary armies fusing older royal units with the volunteer battalions in mixed regiment sized units. Michel joined this new unit which was attached to the Army of Sambre and Meuse. Soon promoted again to Chef-de-Bataillon on October 1, 1795. The Demi-Brigade was then merged with the 93rd Demi-Brigade to become a new 49th Demi-Brigade in 1796, in a second major shake up of the French infantry, and assigned to the new Army of Germany when it is formed from the armies of &#x27;Sambre and Meuse&#x27; and &#x27;Rhine and Moselle&#x27; in 1797.

Michel and the 49th Demi-Brigade was then part of the Gallo-Batavian army assembled in the Batavian Republic and took part in the rushed 1798 expedition to Ireland but was captured at sea aboard &quot;La Furie&quot; and exchanged by the British at the end of the year.

The Gallo-Batavian army provided much opportunity of action due to a combined British and Russian invasion of the republic in the War of the Second Coalition and he fought at Schoorldam, holding his positions at the end of the day, being slightly wounded towards the close of the battle. When the fighting renewed he had his right arm broken by a shot. The Gallo-Batavian army having succeeded in forcing the British/Russian forces to withdraw was moved into Germany in support of the fighting against Austria and Michel had recovered enough distinguish himself at the head of his battalion in the fighting at Burgeberach north of Nuremberg and was there shot in the other arm. This battle along with the larger Hohenlinden broke the Austrians and ended the war. The 49th Demi-Brigade is attached to the &#x27;Army of England&#x27; and moved to quarters around Cherbourg.

==Consulate and Empire==
During the Consulate, with the temporary peace in Europe, France took stock of its colonial holdings. Michel was selected to join the disastrous expedition to Saint-Domingue, in 1802, to attempt to reassert French control over the colony. 
He returned to France in 1803, one of the few survivors, joining the new 40th Regiment of the Line, there had been yet another reorganisation of the infantry and his old unit the 49th Demi-Brigade had been amalgamated with the 24th Demi-Brigade to form a new larger 24th Regiment in his absence. 
He was further promoted to Major, and so second in command, of the 40th Regiment of the Line on 22 November 1803. Then on March 25, 1804 he was made a member of the &quot;Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot;.

The 40th was part of the 3rd Division of Lannes&#x27; V Corps of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; during the War of the Third Coalition and Michel&#x27;s services at the battle of Austerlitz earned him, on December 27, 1805, the rank of Colonel and his admission, and transfer to, the 1st Regiment of Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard, on 1 May 1806. He took up the post of Major in the 1st Grenadiers as everyone serving in the Guard was considered to be a rank above those in the line infantry.

In March 1806 he married Margaret Maret (1784–1875) who was the daughter of Count Jean Philibert Maret, a politician and soon to be appointed to the army Commissariat, and niece of Hugues-Bernard Maret one of the Emperor Napoleon&#x27;s secretaries.

He was promoted to Colonel of the 1st Grenadiers of the Guard, on February 16, 1807, in recognition of his conduct at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt where unused the Guard and Battle of Eylau where they were played a vital role. He fought at the Battle of Friedland again held in reserve, and left for Spain after the Treaty of Tilsit ended the war with Russia and Prussia, shattering the Third Coalition.

In the Peninsular War He fought at Burgos on November 10, 1808 and was elevated to an &quot;Officier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; for displaying great valour and the title of &#x27;Baron of the Empire&#x27;. Now well on his way to becoming part of the new Imperial French aristocracy.

Michel was recalled from Spain to the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; in 1809, and was present at the battles Battle of Eckmühl, Battle of Aspern-Essling and Battle of Wagram. He was appointed &quot;Général d&#x27;Brigade&quot; on June 24, 1811, and fought in the campaign of 1812 in Russian. Again surviving the disastrous destruction of an expedition he returned to France. In 1813 Imperial France was fighting invasions on several fronts, Michel fought in Saxony as part of the German Campaign of 1813 and was elevated again in the &quot;Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; to &quot;Commandeur de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; on April 6, was admitted to the Order of the Iron Crown on August 16 and finally promoted to &quot;Général de division&quot; on November 20.

In 1814 Michel was in command of the 2nd Old Guard Division during the Six Days&#x27; Campaign and by early February in the fighting around Troyes as a prelude to the main campaign, was hunting for the Allied vanguard commanded by the Prince of Lichtenstein. Supported by the dragoons of General André Briche, he surprised the allies at St. Theobald, and despite the greater numbers available to them, pushed them south to St. Parres les Vaudes, away from Troyes. The main events of the Six Day&#x27;s ended for Michel when he was again shot in the arm on February 11 at Battle of Montmirail although he saw out the day, leading a counter attack that pushed back the Prussians. He was still bedridden as a result of this injury, when the Allied armies approached Paris. At the noise of war, the General forgot his wound and reappeared, his arm in a sling, on March 30 before the walls of the capital. Placed in command of a division of conscripts during the battle he was again wounded, by grapeshot in the kidneys. However the fighting was in vain as Paris surrendered the following day and Napoleon was forced into abdication.

== Restoration ==
Upon the restoration in common with many officers of the Empire he was accepted into the service of the King and Louis XVIII named him as a Knight of the Order of Saint Louis on August 20, 1814, and granted him a commission of Colonel in the Royal Guard.

== Hundred Days ==
Again in common with many officers and men of the army he defected back to Napoleon upon his return from Elba. The Emperor raised him to Count of the Empire, and appointed him initially as commander of the 1st &quot;Chasseurs à Pied&quot; of the Old Guard. As part of the &quot;Armée du Nord&quot; he was placed as second in command of the Chasseur Division of the Guard.

At the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, Michel was part of the final assault on La Haye Sainte personally leading the 1st/3rd Chasseurs. They mounted the ridge and were met by intense fire from the British Foot Guards. This attack, which caused heavy losses in the ranks, was also fatal to General Michel. His body was not recovered and is buried with his comrades on the battle field. His name is engraved on column 10 of the northern pillar of the Arc de Triomphe.

<text>Mark William Calaway (born March 24, 1965), better known by his ring name The Undertaker, is an American retired professional wrestler. Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, Calaway spent the vast majority of his career wrestling for WWE and in 2022 was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.

Calaway began his career in 1987, working under various gimmicks for World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) and other affiliate promotions. He signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1989 for a brief stint, and then joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1990.

Calaway rebranded himself as &quot;The Undertaker&quot; when he joined the WWF. As one of WWE&#x27;s most high-profile and enduring characters, The Undertaker is famed for his funerary themeing around an undead, macabre &quot;Deadman&quot; persona, which gained significant mainstream popularity and won him the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; award for Best Gimmick a record-setting 5 years in a row. He is the longest-tenured wrestler in company history at 30 years. In 2000, the Undertaker adopted a biker identity nicknamed &quot;American Badass&quot;. Calaway resurrected the Deadman gimmick in 2004, with residual elements of the &quot;American Badass&quot; remaining.

The Undertaker was known for his role in WWE&#x27;s flagship event WrestleMania. He achieved 21 consecutive victories at Wrestlemania, referred to in WWE as The Streak. He headlined the event five times (13, 24, 26, 33 and 36). He is also known for pairing with his in-storyline half-brother Kane, with whom he alternatively feuded and teamed (as the Brothers of Destruction) from 1997 through 2020. During his wrestling career under the Undertaker gimmick, Calaway won the WWF/E Championship four times, the World Heavyweight Championship three times, the Hardcore Championship once and the World Tag Team Championship six times. He also won the Royal Rumble match in 2007.

== Early life ==
Mark William Calaway was born in Houston, Texas, on March 24, 1965, the son of Frank Compton Calaway (died July 2003) and Betty Catherine Truby. He has four older brothers named David, Michael, Paul, and Timothy (died March 2020, aged 63). He attended Waltrip High School, where he was a member of the football and basketball teams. He graduated in 1983 and began studying on a basketball scholarship at Angelina College in Lufkin, Texas. In 1985, he enrolled in Texas Wesleyan University in Fort Worth, Texas, where he majored in sport management and played as a center for the Rams in the 1985–1986 season. In 1986, Calaway dropped out of university to focus on a career in sports and briefly considered playing professional basketball in Europe, before deciding to focus on professional wrestling.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1987–1989) ===
Calaway began training under Buzz Sawyer in late 1986; he disliked Sawyer, who reportedly lacked commitment and provided a limited education. Calaway learned &quot;on the job&quot; thereafter. Performing under a mask as Texas Red, Calaway wrestled his first match on June 26, 1987, for World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), losing to Bruiser Brody at the Dallas Sportatorium. He was accompanied to the ring by Percival &quot;Percy&quot; Pringle III, who would later serve as his manager in the WWF as Paul Bearer. Two myths have circulated regarding Calaway&#x27;s beginnings in the industry, the first being that he made his in-ring debut in 1984, and the second being that he was trained by former WCCW colleague Don Jardine (aka The Spoiler). While never trained by Jardine, Calaway was an admirer of his work and would emulate Jardine&#x27;s top rope walk. &quot;PWInsider&quot;″s Mike Johnson stated, &quot;Undertaker using some of Jardine&#x27;s style eventually morphed into this story that he was trained by Jardine.&quot;

He wrestled in Durban, South Africa on August 22, 1987, as &quot;Texas Red Jack&quot;, losing to Tiger Singh. He would also wrestle in prison shows under the name Boris Dragu, a Russian grave digger.

In 1988, Calaway developed a military gimmick named The Commando. Under this persona, he mainly wrestled in the Chicago area for Central Illinois Wrestling. He would also have a brief stint in Georgia for Southern Championship Wrestling.

By the end of 1988, Calaway joined the Continental Wrestling Association, wrestling under several gimmicks. On February 2, 1989, managed by Dutch Mantel, he was reintroduced as The Master of Pain, a former murderer. On April 1, The Master of Pain won his first professional wrestling championship by defeating Jerry Lawler for the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Champion. Just over three weeks had passed when Lawler became the first man to pin him, giving it back to him. While performing as The Punisher upon returning to Dallas, Calaway won the USWA Texas Heavyweight Championship on October 5, 1989, when Eric Embry forfeited the title.

===World Championship Wrestling (1989–1990)===

By the end of 1989, Calaway joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as a villain and adopted the ring name &quot;Mean Mark&quot; Callous, a name devised for him by Terry Funk. He was portrayed as a sinister force, wearing predominantly black ring attire and was described by commentator Jim Ross as having a fondness for pet snakes and the music of Ozzy Osbourne. Callous was promptly drafted into The Skyscrapers tag team to replace a legitimately injured Sid Vicious, and made his debut on January 3, 1990, in a match later televised against Agent Steel and Randy Harris. The new team gained some notoriety at &quot;Clash of the Champions X&quot; when they beat down The Road Warriors after their match. However, Callous&#x27;s partner Dan Spivey left WCW days before their Chicago Street Fight against the Road Warriors at WrestleWar. Callous and a replacement masked Skyscraper were defeated in the street fight and the team broke up soon afterwards. Now a singles wrestler, Callous took on the guidance of Paul E. Dangerously (Paul Heyman).

Calaway later began to question his future in WCW after being told by company booker, Ole Anderson, during contract renewal discussions that nobody would ever pay money to watch him perform. It was in response to this that Calaway made numerous efforts to join the World Wrestling Federation, going to many lengths to land a meeting with Vince McMahon. However, accessing and securing an interview with McMahon was described by Calaway as a despairing task.

Among routes Calaway took to land a meeting with McMahon was trying to convince individuals acquainted with McMahon or already existing WWF talent to recommend him into the WWF, such as Hulk Hogan, Paul Heyman, and Bruce Prichard, crediting the latter two for arranging the meeting at McMahon&#x27;s mansion.

Calaway immediately gave notice to WCW before the interview took place. McMahon initially declined to hire Calaway; however, several days later the owner pitched the idea of an &quot;Old West Undertaker,&quot; a concept he had intended to create for several years but had never found an appropriate wrestler to play the part.

Calaway&#x27;s final WCW match was on September 7 at a &quot;WorldWide&quot; taping in Amarillo, Texas in which he defeated Dave Johnson. During his time in WCW, Calaway briefly wrestled in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) as &quot;Punisher&quot; Dice Morgan. After leaving WCW, he briefly returned to the USWA to participate in a tournament to determine the new USWA Unified World Heavyweight Champion; Calaway defeated Bill Dundee in the first round, but lost to Jerry Lawler in the quarterfinals.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE ===
==== Debut of The Undertaker (1990–1991) ====
In October 1990, Calaway signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), set to portray the &quot;&quot; of McMahon that he had assigned to him, originally entitled &quot;Kane the Undertaker&quot; (&quot;Kane&quot; later added on to &quot;the Undertaker&quot; moniker by the time of his arrival at the urgings of Bruce Prichard, who had always desired a Cain and Abel effect for his character). Despite Calaway&#x27;s perplexed, pessimistic feelings about McMahon&#x27;s gimmick idea, he was readily accepting of the role, feeling anything better than the laughingstock gimmicks of that time, such as The Gobbledy Gooker. Kane the Undertaker was characterized as a menacing derivative of the Wild West undertakers depicted in television westerns. Resulting from that, this first edition of the Undertaker&#x27;s series of Deadman incarnations has been distinguished in external media as &quot;The Old West Mortician&quot;. He made his overall WWF debut on a November 19, 1990, taping of &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; quickly defeating his first opponent, Mario Mancini, in a singles match (this match was filmed three days prior to the Undertaker&#x27;s televised debut at Survivor Series on November 22, but did not air on television until December 15, 1990). Also prior to his Survivor Series appearance, Kane the Undertaker had a match on November 20 against Rick Sampson, which later aired on the December 9, 1990 episode of &quot;WWF Wrestling Challenge&quot;.

Calaway&#x27;s official televised debut was at Survivor Series in which he was presented as the heel mystery partner of Ted DiBiase&#x27;s &quot;Million Dollar Team&quot;. Approximately one minute into the match, the Undertaker eliminated Koko B. Ware with his finisher, the &quot;Tombstone Piledriver&quot;. (In 2018, Koko B. Ware shared that directly following this match that night, he confronted the Undertaker with serious objections to what he felt was a botched Tombstone. Though Ware also shared that he always admired Mark Calaway and perceived him as a great performer). During the match, the Undertaker also eliminated Dusty Rhodes before being counted out; however, his team won the match with DiBiase being the sole survivor. During the match, Calaway was referred to as simply the Undertaker, omitting the portion &quot;Kane&quot;, which was dropped shortly after the event (and seven years later at the urgings of Prichard, given to another wrestler once he took on the role of the Undertaker&#x27;s younger brother). Throughout the end of 1990, the Undertaker mostly picked up squash victories against jobbers on Superstars of Wrestling and Wrestling Challenge tapings. He was a participant in the 1991 Royal Rumble match which was won by Hulk Hogan.

In February 1991, Brother Love delegated his short-lived management role of the Undertaker over to Paul Bearer (real-life funeral director), Love communicating the need for someone who better aligned with the Undertaker&#x27;s &quot;deadman&quot; themes. , wailing and ghostly in character, Bearer complemented the Undertaker and was almost always seen bearing an urn which he raised in the air to transmit supernatural healing powers to the Undertaker; this typically resulted in the Undertaker recovering from attacks and counterattacking his adversaries. During his early years, the Undertaker took to a post-match ritual of placing his defeated opponents (almost always jobbers) in a body bag and carrying them backstage. He continued picking up victories in squash matches leading up to his first feud in the WWF with &quot;Superfly&quot; Jimmy Snuka.

==== WWF Champion and beginning of The Streak (1991–1994) ====
The Undertaker made his WrestleMania debut at WrestleMania VII on March 24, 1991, quickly defeating &quot;Superfly&quot; Jimmy Snuka. He began his first major feud shortly thereafter, which was with The Ultimate Warrior when The Undertaker attacked him and locked him in an airtight casket on the set of Paul Bearer&#x27;s &quot;Funeral Parlor&quot; segment. Resulting from this, the Warrior enlisted the assistance of Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts to get him mentally psyched for The Undertaker&#x27;s morbid alarmist tactics: Roberts would drill the Warrior with &quot;know your enemy&quot; training, setting up the Warrior in a series of creepy, terrorizing circumstances, such as by locking him in caskets and in rooms with snakes. This culminated in a final stage of Roberts&#x27;s training in which Roberts proved to be stringing Warrior along the entire time by assisting The Undertaker in an ambush. The Undertaker would later suffer his first losses in the WWF to The Ultimate Warrior, including in a first ever body bag challenge, a casket match, and (at house show) standard pin-fall match. The feud was, however, cut short after the Warrior&#x27;s suspension and ongoing issues with Vince McMahon. In the 1991 King of the Ring, Undertaker defeated Animal in a qualifying match before fighting Sid Vicious to a double disqualification in the semifinal, which saw both men eliminated from the King of the Ring tournament.
The Undertaker defeated Hulk Hogan to win his first WWF Championship at Survivor Series with the help of Ric Flair and thus became the youngest WWF Champion in history to that point, 26 years of age—this record was later broken by Yokozuna in April 1993 at WrestleMania IX. The Undertaker&#x27;s Tombstone of Hogan to win the WWF Championship at the 1991 Survivor Series created real-life, offscreen discord between the two, which Undertaker attributes his short title reign, lack of title runs during his early career and distrust of Hogan. In storyline, however, WWF President Jack Tunney ordered a rematch between the two at This Tuesday in Texas six days later, where The Undertaker lost the title back to Hogan. However, due to the controversial endings of the two title matches between The Undertaker and Hogan, the title was vacated from Hogan the next night by Tunney. The company was without a WWF Champion until Ric Flair earned it by winning the 1992 Royal Rumble match.

In February 1992, The Undertaker&#x27;s ally Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts tried to attack &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage&#x27;s manager/wife Miss Elizabeth with a steel chair when Undertaker stopped him, turning him (and Paul Bearer) face for the first time. Their face turn was solidified on the February 29 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot; when Roberts confronted The Undertaker on the &quot;Funeral Parlor&quot; set over the matter (aired on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXX&quot;). After demanding to know whose side The Undertaker was on and getting the reply, &quot;Not yours,&quot; Roberts attacked both Bearer and The Undertaker, only for The Undertaker to stand his ground and run Roberts off. The Undertaker defeated Roberts at WrestleMania VIII. He then feuded extensively with wrestlers managed by Harvey Wippleman throughout 1992 and 1993, such as Kamala and Giant González. Also during this time, The Undertaker headlined the debut episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; on January 11, 1993, with a victory over Damien Demento. According to Calaway, working with González &quot;...was survival every night trying to figure out what he could do&quot; and &quot;took years off my career&quot;. He faced González at WrestleMania IX, which is notable as The Undertaker&#x27;s only disqualification win at WrestleMania after the use of chloroform. The Undertaker&#x27;s next rivalry initiated at Survivor Series with Yokozuna when a clash between the two lost control, causing them to be counted out in an elimination tag match. In the weeks following, The Undertaker and Bearer spooked Yokozuna with multiple segments from their wintery and remote rural area workshop. There, Bearer presented The Undertaker hard at work carpentering Yokozuna what would eventually become a &quot;double wide, double deep casket&quot; custom-built for Yokozuna&#x27;s immensely overweight size. The feud culminated in a WWF Championship casket match at the Royal Rumble in January 1994. During the match, Yokozuna sealed The Undertaker in the casket with the assistance of a multitude of heel wrestlers (some of them Whippleman-managed) hired by Yokozuna&#x27;s vindictive managers Jim Cornette and Mr. Fuji, which was in retaliation for Bearer&#x27;s casket match stipulation that he snuck into their Royal Rumble match contract. After being trapped inside the casket by the pack, green vapor emitted from the casket and the arena lights went out. Undertaker then appeared from inside the casket on the video screen, representing the spirit of his dead corpse, warning that he would produce a future &quot;rebirth&quot; of himself, explaining to his antagonists that he cannot and will not Rest in Peace. The Undertaker did not appear in the WWF for seven months after his loss to Yokozuna. In reality, he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal.

==== Rebirthed Deadman (1994–1996) ====

Following the death angle at the Royal Rumble during The Undertaker&#x27;s absence, the WWF promoted reported sightings of him through video clips of random people claiming to have seen him. After WrestleMania X, Ted DiBiase introduced an Undertaker back to the WWF. This Undertaker, however, played by Brian Lee (one of Calaway&#x27;s real-life best friends) was an impostor Undertaker (dubbed &quot;The Underfaker&quot; by fans) rejuvenated by Dibiase&#x27;s money rather than Bearer&#x27;s urn. His actions led to the return of the real Undertaker at SummerSlam, defeating the impostor and appearing as a reincarnation of his Deadman gimmick, one of a more shadowy, mysterious and secret presence. Represented now by cool colors, The Undertaker replaced details of his wrestling gear that were previously colored gray with purple, and effected scenes with blue/purple semidarkness. Many details that would become associated with The Undertaker for the remainder of his career were produced during this rebirth incarnation, such as the addition of sleeve tattoos and Godlike supernatural elements (thunder, lightning and windy weather-like effects used to indicate The Undertaker&#x27;s presence and wrath).

Seeking retribution, The Undertaker revisited his feud with Yokozuna and eventually faced him in a casket rematch at Survivor Series. Chuck Norris (portraying his &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; persona) was involved in the match as special guest enforcer, preventing interference from wrestlers that Yokozuna, Jim Cornette and Mr. Fuji had again enlisted for help. Unable to rely on much as far as interference this time around (only Irwin R. Schyster able to get in a brief ambush) due to Norris averting the attempts of several heel wrestlers, Yokozuna was defeated by The Undertaker and sealed in the casket. Throughout most of 1995, Undertaker feuded with members of Ted DiBiase&#x27;s Million Dollar Corporation. The chain of wrestlers DiBiase enlisted to do away with The Undertaker started with Irwin R. Schyster at the Royal Rumble for which The Undertaker was victorious, but assaulted by another member of the Million Dollar Team, King Kong Bundy. While being assaulted, Bearer was deprived of his urn by the Corporation. At WrestleMania XI, The Undertaker made short work of Bundy in a singles match. This edition of WrestleMania included the first mention of The Undertaker&#x27;s historic WrestleMania-winning Streak, acknowledged on commentary by Vince McMahon as Undertaker made his entrance: &quot;The Undertaker, on his way to the ring—a man who&#x27;s never lost at WrestleMania.&quot; During The Undertaker&#x27;s WrestleMania encounter, DiBiase issued him with yet another antagonist in &quot;The Supreme Fighting Machine&quot; Kama, who had stolen the briefly recaptured urn from Bearer during the match. Kama followed this up with a series of malicious acts, including destroying the stolen urn and recycling it into bling. While sporting the flashy bling around his neck, he repeatedly cost The Undertaker matches and attacked diehard Undertaker fans, dubbed &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;. In August, Undertaker settled the score with Kama, defeating him in a casket match at SummerSlam. Several weeks later, Undertaker suffered a serious orbital bone injury when King Mabel unintentionally struck him in the eye with his fist during a house show, forcing The Undertaker into a period of absence for surgery. Due to the incident happening at a house show, Vince McMahon had it presented to the audience as though it had occurred from Mabel and Yokozuna&#x27;s exchange of leg drops and splashes on The Undertaker on the &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; that had aired 2 days prior. The Undertaker returned a couple months later at Survivor Series, in which he single-handedly eliminated an entire team of wrestlers led by King Mabel, The Undertaker leading his own team to victory. It was at that Survivor Series return in which he began wearing a &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;-like, gray upper-face mask to safeguard his orbital injury while it healed. The following month in December, The Undertaker defeated Mabel in a casket match at In Your House, retrieving the urn, which had been traded between several of The Undertaker&#x27;s antagonists over the course of the year.

In the main event of the Royal Rumble in January 1996, The Undertaker was unmasked of his Phantom of the Opera-like facial covering in a WWF Championship match against Bret Hart. The Undertaker was eventually able to hit the &quot;Tombstone Piledriver&quot; on Hart, but Diesel interfered, costing The Undertaker the championship. A rematch for the title on the February 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; saw similar interference. At that month&#x27;s In Your House: Rage in the Cage, while Diesel was facing Hart in a steel cage match for the WWF Championship, The Undertaker delivered a surprise attack, emerging from a hole he had ripped through the ring canvas and dragging Diesel with him down under amid a cloud of smoke, allowing Hart the victory. After several weeks of more retaliatory between Diesel and The Undertaker, their feud culminated in a singles match at WrestleMania XII, where Undertaker was victorious.

The Undertaker&#x27;s next feud commenced the next night on &quot;Raw&quot; when Mankind, a twisted and tortured soul, made his debut and randomly interfered in Undertaker&#x27;s match against Justin &quot;Hawk&quot; Bradshaw. For the next few months, Mankind viciously ambushed The Undertaker and cost him multiple matches. Among them, Mankind cost The Undertaker the WWF Intercontinental Championship by interfering in his casket match against Goldust at In Your House 8: Beware of Dog. In interfering in this match, Mankind proved to have mystifying horror tactic capabilities that matched The Undertaker&#x27;s, mysteriously appearing from inside the casket and sealing The Undertaker inside. The Undertaker, however, had vanished amid a cloud of smoke once the casket lid was opened. As a result of the interference and repeated ambushes from Mankind on The Undertaker throughout the ensuing weeks, The Undertaker and Mankind competed in their first on-screen bout at the 1996 King of the Ring, a heated encounter in which The Undertaker presented as uncharacteristically intense. During the match, Bearer inadvertently hit The Undertaker with the urn, allowing Mankind to incapacitate The Undertaker with his finisher, the Mandible Claw, and score the win. With Mankind insatiably continuing to cost The Undertaker matches even following their King of the Ring encounter, The Undertaker began firing back with rage and the feud spiraled out of control: the two routinely interrupted other matches already in progress, battling each other at random intervals outside of having arranged matches—their chaos also spilling into audiences, arena backstage communal areas, and arena boiler rooms, all of this unprecedented at the time. As a result, the first ever Boiler Room Brawl (Mankind&#x27;s specialty match) was booked between the two at SummerSlam. After more than 20 minutes of brawling with Mankind in the Cleveland Gund Arena&#x27;s boiler room, the arena corridors, the SummerSlam entrance area and aisleway to the ring, The Undertaker reached for Paul Bearer&#x27;s urn in an attempt to win the match, but Bearer struck him with it, betraying The Undertaker. This followed with Bearer allowing Mankind to take hold of the urn, thus winning this match. According to Paul Bearer in shoot interviews the WWF wanted Bearer to betray him during that match because it was a storyline that Kane was coming and they wanted The Undertaker to get ready for the angle with Kane the following year by having Bearer turn on him. After Bearer&#x27;s betrayal, The Undertaker grew more aggressive, resolving his feud against Goldust (Mankind&#x27;s comrade in tormenting The Undertaker) at In Your House 10: Mind Games. The Undertaker then took his rivalry with Mankind to new lengths in a specialty match of his own, and at that time unprecedented Buried Alive match to take place in the main event of In Your House 11: Buried Alive. The Undertaker won the match after chokeslamming Mankind into the open grave and subsequently shoveling enough dirt on him so that he was covered. However, after interference from the debuting Executioner, as well as the help of several other heel wrestlers apparently enlisted by Bearer, Mankind escaped the grave and together the mob all shoveled dirt onto The Undertaker to the point that the grave was completely filled, resulting in The Undertaker fully buried alive. Not without a parting message for the pack, however, The Undertaker&#x27;s purple glove fit hand emerged from his burying place amid a bolt of lightning that had erupted over the gravesite. The scene sent all of his antagonists fleeing.

==== Lord of Darkness (1996–1998) ====
After being buried alive and a following month-long hiatus, The Undertaker returned at the Survivor Series again pitting him against Mankind, but with a unique stipulation: Hanging above the ring would be Paul Bearer, enclosed in a steel cage. And if The Undertaker were to win the match, he would be rewarded the opportunity to assault Bearer however he pleased. Even though The Undertaker won this match, interference from The Executioner enabled Bearer to escape Undertaker&#x27;s clutches. It was also at this event that The Undertaker had developed a comparatively more humanized and more informal yet still superhuman &quot;Deadman&quot; incarnation. In this then new form, he took on a Goth appearance and persona, with a brash, rebelling, Championship-driven mean streak (perhaps to better fit in with the then-budding, more adult-oriented Attitude Era). This delivering, dubbed &quot;The Lord of Darkness&quot;, was the 3rd incarnation of his Deadman persona. Following Survivor Series, The Undertaker briefly turned his attention to The Executioner, who had been interfering in his matches since his arrival. At In Your House 12: It&#x27;s Time, The Undertaker defeated The Executioner in an Armageddon Rules match even with Mankind heavily involved throughout the entire encounter. The Undertaker then moved on to feud with Vader, whom he faced in January 1997 at the Royal Rumble in a singles match, which The Undertaker lost after Bearer interfered on behalf of his new protégé. The two then clashed in the Royal Rumble match itself as they made it to the final moments of the match, but both were eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin, who had crept back into the match after his elimination was unseen. He faced both Vader and Austin in a four-corners elimination match for the vacant WWF Championship at In Your House 13: Final Four, but Bret Hart won. However, the following month, The Undertaker managed to win the WWF Championship for the second time by defeating Sycho Sid at WrestleMania 13. Reviving his first Deadman incarnation for that night only, The Undertaker appeared as the &quot;Old West Mortician&quot;, donning the trademarked gray wrestling gear accessories (boot spats, tie, gloves), along with a pitch-black entrance with only a white spotlight shined over him, contrasted from the purple/blue semidarkness associated with the rest of his Deadman incarnations.

Following his WWF Championship win at WrestleMania 13, Paul Bearer attempted to rejoin The Undertaker as his manager. After The Undertaker refused and attacked Bearer, Bearer had Mankind set a fireball to the Undertaker&#x27;s face, leading up to a match at In Your House 14: Revenge of the &#x27;Taker, for which The Undertaker was victorious. Evening the score at &quot;Revenge of the &#x27;Taker&quot;, The Undertaker set a fireball to Bearer&#x27;s face directly following the match. Following the event, Bearer bandaged up from fire burns, likened The Undertaker&#x27;s assault to a past incident he described as The Undertaker&#x27;s &quot;deepest, darkest secret&quot;. Through giving The Undertaker the ultimatum of revealing his deepest, darkest secret to the world, Bearer was able to reunite with him as manager and protégé. After only a few months of abrasive behaviors from Bearer, however, The Undertaker lost his patience and rejected Bearer as his manager. In retaliation, Bearer disclosed that The Undertaker had intentionally killed his family by burning down his parents&#x27; family funeral home for which they raised him and his younger brother. (Note that the younger brother, Kane, was not revealed to be The Undertaker&#x27;s half-brother until the following year, April 1998, when Bearer disclosed to the world that he is Kane&#x27;s father, The Undertaker&#x27;s mother having had an affair with him. Bearer later verified this with DNA test results). At this point in his career, The Undertaker denied the charges of committing the arson murder that killed his family; however, Bearer claimed to have proof in the form of The Undertaker&#x27;s alive and well younger brother, Kane, who had survived though scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a &quot;pyromaniac&quot;, had been the one to set the fire and, as a result, could not have possibly even survived. (Note that it would not be until a year and a half later from this point, in latter 1998, in which The Undertaker would shamelessly confess to intentional acts of arson to the funeral home that killed his parents and scarred his brother).
In spite of Bearer projecting himself as a constant source of mental distress to The Undertaker during his Championship title reign, The Undertaker managed to secure successful title defenses against Stone Cold Steve Austin (A Cold Day In Hell: In Your House), Faarooq (King of the Ring) and Vader (Canadian Stampede: In Your House, revisiting and settling their Royal Rumble feud from earlier on in the year), respectively. Concurrent to the &quot;deep, dark secret&quot; storyline directed by Bearer, Undertaker began a then new rivalry at SummerSlam when special guest referee Shawn Michaels accidentally hit him with a steel chair shot intended for his archnemesis Bret Hart, in effect, costing The Undertaker the WWF Championship. The accidental chair shot led to Michaels feeling betrayed by the now booing WWF fans, and quickly becoming heel. Thus, a severely violent storyline with The Undertaker followed, one revolving around repeated intentional chair shots by Michaels on the Undertaker, Michaels taunting The Undertaker throughout. After the duo&#x27;s first match, which was a chaotic and uncontrolled encounter that resulted in a double count-out draw at Ground Zero: In Your House, Undertaker challenged Michaels to the first ever Hell in a Cell match to take place at Badd Blood: In Your House. Despite the inclusion of the cell for more order and to prevent Michaels from receiving help from his D-Generation X stable, the encounter ended up even more uncontrolled and savage than their first and is considered one of The Undertaker&#x27;s best matches of his career. Seemingly about to emerge the victor after striking Michaels with a chair shot of his own, The Undertaker was interrupted by his storyline half-brother Kane, finally making his debut. Under the control of Paul Bearer, Kane stormed the arena, ripped off the cell door, and laid out a nonplussed Undertaker with his own trademarked finisher, &quot;The Tombstone Piledriver&quot;, allowing Michaels to pin him for the victory. As the storyline progressed through Bearer having Kane mow down much of the WWF roster, Kane repeatedly challenged The Undertaker, going to lengths of tormenting and humiliating him. However, The Undertaker consistently refused to fight his half-brother, claiming he had made a vow to his parents never to do harm to his own &quot;flesh and blood&quot;. The Undertaker&#x27;s final encounter with Michaels during this chapter of his career was in a casket match for the WWF Championship at the Royal Rumble. The week before on &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane had duplicitously presented as allying with his brother against Michaels&#x27;s D-Generation X stable; however, at the Royal Rumble, Kane trapped The Undertaker in the coffin, padlocked the lid shut, and set the casket ablaze, allowing Michaels another victory. After a two-month hiatus in which Kane wreaked havoc over the WWF, The Undertaker returned on the March 2, 1998 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in a most notable resurrection—his druids interrupting Kane and Bearer by presenting them with a coffin on the entrance stage amid a large number of bell tolls. The coffin was struck and dismantled by a lightning bolt, revealing a lied out Undertaker who sat up in a fury state and challenged Kane to do battle with him. At WrestleMania XIV in their first match, The Undertaker defeated Kane. Kane challenged Undertaker to a rematch—Kane&#x27;s specialty and first ever Inferno match—that occurred one month later at . The Undertaker won the encounter by setting Kane&#x27;s right arm on fire.

The Undertaker and Mankind&#x27;s wildly violent, outlandish feud from over a year previous to this point was revitalized over the next month, ultimately taken to a new graphic height and decisively resolved when they faced each other in a Hell in a Cell match at King of the Ring. The match became one of the most famous matches in professional wrestling history. During the match, the Undertaker threw Mankind off the roof of the cell onto a broadcast table below, in what was a preplanned move. He later performed a chokeslam on Mankind through the roof of the cell into the ring, which was not preplanned and legitimately knocked Mankind unconscious. In jumping from the top of the cell to the ring canvas, The Undertaker suffered a broken ankle. Escalating as things progressed, blood flowed from both wrestlers as they attacked each other with steel steps, chairs, the cell wall, etc. Topping that off, Mankind introduced multitudes of thumbtacks scattered across the ring canvas but was back body dropped on them, and subsequently chokeslammed onto them before The Undertaker won the match with his &quot;Tombstone Piledriver&quot;. At Fully Loaded: In Your House, the Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kane and Mankind to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. The Undertaker and Austin&#x27;s reign as tag team champions lasted only two weeks, as Kane and Mankind regained the titles from them in a fatal four-way tag-team match on the August 10 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;. The Undertaker then became the number one contender for the WWF Championship, held by Austin at that point, for a match at SummerSlam. Shortly before SummerSlam and after much speculation, The Undertaker finally disclosed that he and his half-brother were working together. Despite this revelation, The Undertaker told Kane before his SummerSlam bout that he did not want him interfering, even sending Kane away during the match itself when he appeared. Even though The Undertaker lost the match at SummerSlam, he handed Austin his championship belt back after the match with a show of respect and sportsmanship.

In September as the storyline matured however, The Undertaker subtly began showing some heel characteristics, becoming a . This began when he and Kane revealed the fact that they were in cahoots to rid Austin of his title for villainous company owner Mr. McMahon—Austin and McMahon immersed in a bitter rivalry during this era. At , The Undertaker and Kane were booked in a triple threat match with Austin for the WWF Championship, in which McMahon stated that the brothers were not allowed to pin each other. The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin simultaneously after a double chokeslam, ending the match in a no contest, so the title was vacated by McMahon. This event led to a match at Judgment Day: In Your House between The Undertaker and Kane for the title, with Austin as the special guest referee. Near the end of the match, Paul Bearer seemed about to assist Kane by handing him a steel chair to hit The Undertaker with, but as Kane had his back turned, both Bearer and The Undertaker hit Kane with chair shots. The Undertaker went for the pin, but Austin refused to count the fall, attacked The Undertaker and counted out both of them. Finally the next night on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, The Undertaker reconciled with Bearer and claimed that he and Bearer would unleash their &quot;Ministry of Darkness&quot; on the WWF, turning heel for the first time since 1992. As part of the then new storyline angle, The Undertaker admitted that he had indeed intentionally set the fire that killed his parents and scarred Kane, for which he had previously blamed on Kane.

==== Ministry of Darkness Deadman (1998–1999) ====

After Survivor Series, The Undertaker returned his attention to his previous feud with Austin for costing him the title at Judgment Day, hitting Austin in the head with a shovel during a title match with The Rock on the November 16 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, returning the favor for what happened a month earlier. With this twist in the storyline, Mr. McMahon scheduled a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Austin at Rock Bottom: In Your House. In the weeks leading up to Rock Bottom, The Undertaker attempted to embalm Austin alive, tried to have Kane committed to a mental asylum, and had his druids chain Austin to an immense structure of his Undertaker crucifix-like logo (which took the appearance of a capital T combined X) before having that structure lifted up on high into the air. However, The Undertaker lost the Buried Alive match to Austin at Rock Bottom after Kane interfered.

After the buildup to his second heel run in the latter part of 1998, The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999—a dark priest-like character who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. He often proclaimed to be invoking and taking orders from a &quot;Higher Power&quot;. Moreover, he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne with a towering backrest specially designed into his crucifix-like logo. With the help of his minions, he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers, using various incantations and magic words with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry. The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of The Brood (Christian, Edge and Gangrel), The Acolytes (Bradshaw and Faarooq), Mideon and Viscera. Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period, having undergone a hip replacement. As part of the angle, The Undertaker had his Ministry members fight his battles, carry out his evil wishes and do all his dirty deeds. In this manner, he expressed his desires to take over the World Wrestling Federation, displacing its owner, Mr. McMahon. These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and The Corporation, ultimately resulting in a match between The Undertaker and Corporation enforcer, Big Boss Man. The two faced off in a Hell in a Cell match at WrestleMania XV, which The Undertaker won. At , The Undertaker defeated Corporation member Ken Shamrock after interference from Ministry member Bradshaw.

Thereafter, The Undertaker kidnapped Stephanie McMahon, forcing Mr. McMahon to enter into a reluctant alliance with his longtime nemesis Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Undertaker attempted to marry Stephanie before sacrificing her in an ceremony conducted by Paul Bearer, but Austin was able to rescue her. At the Over the Edge pay-per-view, The Undertaker defeated Austin for his third WWF Championship with help from Shane McMahon, the special guest referee. The Ministry eventually merged with Shane McMahon&#x27;s Corporation alliance to form The Corporate Ministry. The Undertaker later revealed that Mr. McMahon had been his &quot;Higher Power&quot; all along as a scheme against Austin. After The Undertaker lost the WWF Championship back to Austin on the &quot;Raw&quot; following King of the Ring and lost to him in a First Blood match at Fully Loaded, his relationship with the McMahons dissolved and The Corporate Ministry disbanded.

The Undertaker then began a storyline where he teamed with Big Show in a tag team known as &quot;The Unholy Alliance&quot;, which held the WWF Tag Team Championship twice. After their victory at SummerSlam, The Undertaker suffered a groin tear and was seen limping in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches in the following weeks, instead overbearingly ordering Big Show to fight his battles and do all his dirty deeds. Developing a comedy horror smart mouth during this time, elements of The Undertaker&#x27;s trash-talking biker identity (that he would eventually introduce in 2000) began peeping out during this phase of his career. According to an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to return to WCW with a non-trademarked persona; had he entered WCW, it would have been as Mark Calaway. According to Nash, although negotiations were described as close, Calaway ultimately re-signed with the WWF. Conversely, while on Steve Austin&#x27;s &quot;Broken Skull Sessions&quot; podcast on November 22, 2020, Calaway revealed that there was no way he was ever going to rejoin WCW, that the gimmick&#x27;s biker transition was just a matter of him mixing things up because he didn&#x27;t feel the character&#x27;s Deadman side properly fit with the then ongoing Attitude Era.

To compensate for his lack of physical activity, The Undertaker became increasingly overbearing and vocal, often mouthing off with a weirdness and making sinisterly remarks in promos and on commentary. On the September 23, 1999, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Mr. McMahon threatened that he would remove The Undertaker from the Unforgiven main event if he refused to participate in a casket match against Triple H. The Undertaker retorted that he did not care and maybe he would not be participating in anything WWF any longer, from there walking out on the WWF.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWF SmackDown! - 09/23/1999&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Calaway went on a hiatus from the WWF in order to treat his groin injury. He made his return to action on December 14, teaming with Viscera in a losing effort against Kane and The Godfather at a house show in Coamo, Puerto Rico. The Undertaker was advertised on the Armageddon promotional poster to return, but meanwhile also tore his pectoral muscle, taking him out of action for almost eight months.

==== American Badass (2000–2001) ====
In May 2000, Calaway expanded on The Undertaker gimmick, returning under a human alter ego of the gimmick—a smack-talking, redneck biker, dubbed &quot;The American Badass&quot;, known for motorcycle-riding, tobacco chewing/spitting, and donning a sporty appearance and manner. In stark contrast to his horror-themed and fully fictional Deadman persona, Calaway&#x27;s Badass persona was only semifictional with traits and features adopted from who he is out of character—hence, why he desired to transform The Undertaker. While explained off screen years later for the above reasons, Calaway&#x27;s sudden appearance as American Badass Undertaker after hiatus in which he left off as Deadman Undertaker was never explained within WWE storylines or the WWE&#x27;s fictional universe. Rather, the expectation was for fans to just go with it.

When The Undertaker returned near the end of the iron man match for the WWF Championship between Triple H and The Rock at Judgment Day on May 21, 2000, he took out all the members of the McMahon-Helmsley Faction, which created for a face turn after having left things off as a heel before his hiatus. He also targeted their leader, then WWF Champion Triple H. At the King of the Ring pay-per-view on June 25, The Undertaker teamed with The Rock and Kane to defeat the team of Triple H, Shane McMahon and Vince McMahon. Afterward, he was booked to team with Kane to contend for the WWF Tag Team Championship. They defeated Edge and Christian, earning the right to face them the following week for the championship, which Edge and Christian retained. During an August 14 &quot;Raw is War&quot; bout against Chris Benoit, Kane became involved and betrayed The Undertaker by hitting him with two chokeslams, the second one causing the ring apron to cave in underneath The Undertaker. This incident led to another match between the two at SummerSlam on August 27, which ended in a no contest as Kane fled from the ring area after The Undertaker removed Kane&#x27;s mask.

The Undertaker then challenged Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship at Survivor Series on November 19. Angle, however, defeated The Undertaker after he switched places with his real-life brother, Eric Angle. The Undertaker demanded and was awarded a spot in the six-man Hell in a Cell match for the WWF Championship at Armageddon on December 10. The Undertaker promised to make someone famous and did so when he performed a chokeslam on Rikishi from the roof of the cell into hay-filled cargo bed of a truck.

The Undertaker reunited with Kane as the Brothers of Destruction, issuing a challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship once again. They received a title shot at No Way Out on February 25, 2001, facing Edge and Christian and then champions The Dudley Boyz in a tables match but were unsuccessful. The Undertaker then went on to defeat Triple H at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1. He and Kane continued a storyline that focused on Triple H, who formed a &quot;surprise alliance&quot; with then WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Brothers of Destruction were granted an opportunity to face Triple H and Austin for their titles (Triple H was the WWF Intercontinental Champion). After The Undertaker and Kane won the WWF Tag Team Championship from Edge and Christian on the April 19 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Triple H pinned Kane after attacking him with a sledgehammer at Backlash on April 29, where the Brothers of Destruction lost their championships. With Kane injured, The Undertaker feuded briefly with Austin for his WWF Championship, but he failed to win the title at Judgment Day on May 20.

As part of &quot;The Invasion&quot; storyline, The Undertaker&#x27;s next nemesis was Diamond Dallas Page, who was obsessively stalking The Undertaker&#x27;s wife, Sara. At SummerSlam on August 19, WCW Tag Team Champions The Undertaker and Kane defeated Page and his partner Kanyon in a steel cage match to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. At Survivor Series on November 18, The Undertaker teamed with Kane, The Rock, Chris Jericho and Big Show to take on The Alliance&#x27;s Stone Cold Steve Austin, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, Shane McMahon and Kurt Angle (this was the last time The Undertaker and Kane teamed until 2006). Angle pinned The Undertaker due to interference by Austin. Despite this, Team WWF won the match.

==== Big Evil (2001–2003) ====
After The Alliance was defeated, The Undertaker inducted commentator Jim Ross into the &quot;Mr. McMahon: Kiss My Ass Club&quot; on the November 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, which involved The Undertaker pressing the lips of Ross against McMahon&#x27;s exposed buttocks, turning heel in the process. In transitioning his &quot;American Badass&quot; biker identity into a heel, The Undertaker eventually cut his long hair short and went by the nickname &quot;Big Evil&quot;. At Vengeance on December 9, The Undertaker defeated Rob Van Dam to win the WWF Hardcore Championship.
The Undertaker&#x27;s next storyline began at the Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002, when Maven eliminated him from the Royal Rumble match by hitting him with a dropkick from behind. Subsequently, The Undertaker eliminated Maven in return and brutally assaulted him backstage. Thereafter, on an episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, The Rock angered The Undertaker by mentioning his elimination at the Royal Rumble. He responded by costing The Rock the number one contendership for the Undisputed WWF Championship. The storyline continued when The Rock cost The Undertaker the WWF Hardcore Championship against Maven on the February 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. The two faced off at No Way Out on February 17, where The Undertaker lost due to interference from Ric Flair. This interference began a storyline with Flair, who declined a challenge to wrestle The Undertaker at WrestleMania X8 on March 17. As a result, The Undertaker assaulted Flair&#x27;s son David Flair. Flair eventually accepted the match after The Undertaker threatened to inflict the same punishment on Flair&#x27;s daughter. A no-disqualification stipulation was added to the match and The Undertaker defeated Flair at WrestleMania.
After the storyline with Flair, The Undertaker was drafted to the Raw brand after the WWF split its roster into two brands and defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin at Backlash on April 21 to become the number one contender for the Undisputed WWF Championship. Later that night, he helped Hollywood Hulk Hogan win the title against then champion Triple H. The Undertaker then defeated Hogan for the renamed WWE Undisputed Championship at Judgment Day on May 19. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, The Undertaker seemingly lost the WWE Undisputed Championship to Rob Van Dam; however, Raw owner Ric Flair restarted the match (Van Dam pinned The Undertaker when his foot was on the rope, thus invalidating the pin attempt) and The Undertaker defeated Van Dam to retain the championship. On the July 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Undertaker defeated Jeff Hardy in a ladder match to retain the WWE Undisputed Championship and raised Hardy&#x27;s hand as a show of respect, turning face once again. The Undertaker, however, lost the title at Vengeance on July 21 to The Rock in a triple threat match that also involved Kurt Angle. On the August 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, The Undertaker moved to the SmackDown! brand (where he remained until the first brand extension ended in 2011), and defeated Chris Benoit and Kurt Angle in a triple threat match to become the number-one contender for the renamed WWE Championship and challenged Brock Lesnar for the title at Unforgiven on September 22 that ended in a double disqualification. Their feud carried over to No Mercy on October 20 in a Hell in a Cell match, which The Undertaker performed with a legitimately broken hand and ultimately lost to Lesnar.

The Undertaker took a break after Big Show threw him off the stage on the October 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, sparking a feud. The Undertaker returned at the Royal Rumble on January 19, 2003. He immediately continued his feud with Big Show and defeated him by submission at No Way Out on February 23 with a triangle choke. A-Train entered the storyline by attempting to attack The Undertaker after the match, but Nathan Jones came to his aid. The storyline resumed as The Undertaker began to train Jones to wrestle and the two were scheduled to fight Big Show and A-Train in a tag team match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30. However, Jones was removed before the match, making it a handicap match, which The Undertaker won with the help of Jones.

Over the remainder of the year, The Undertaker entered a brief feud with John Cena (defeating him at Vengeance on July 27) and was booked to have two WWE Championship opportunities. The first, on the September 4 &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, against Kurt Angle, ended in a no contest, due to interference from Brock Lesnar. The second, at No Mercy on October 19, was a Biker Chain match between The Undertaker and Lesnar, which Lesnar won with the help of Vince McMahon. This match resulted in a feud with McMahon, culminating at Survivor Series on November 16 where The Undertaker lost a Buried Alive match against McMahon when Kane interfered. The Undertaker disappeared for some time following this match, with Kane claiming that he was &quot;dead and buried forever&quot;.

==== Return of the Deadman (2004–2007) ====

In the storyline leading up to WrestleMania XX, Kane was tormented by horror-themed mind games, paranormal activities, and spooking vignettes proclaiming The Undertaker&#x27;s Deadman return. The first was during the Royal Rumble when The Undertaker&#x27;s bells tolled, distracting Kane and allowing Booker T to eliminate him. Accompanied by Paul Bearer at WrestleMania XX, The Undertaker resurrected his Deadman identity, defeating Kane in a singles match. Introduced was a more dramatic, theatrical and supernatural Deadman than in years past, his presence, mannerisms, and entrances significantly elaborated on as well, such as with more intensity, special effects and rising and falling flames. At the same time, The Undertaker maintained elements of his American Badass identity, thus a composite character more humanized than all of his previous Deadman incarnations (The Undertaker would present in this particular hybrid Deadman form until No Mercy 2005 when Randy Orton sealed him in a casket and set it on fire). At Judgment Day, The Undertaker defeated Booker T. One week later, Paul Heyman ordered The Dudley Boyz to kidnap Bearer. Thus, Heyman &quot;took control&quot; of Undertaker. At The Great American Bash, The Undertaker fought a handicap match against The Dudley Boyz, with the stipulation that if he did not lay down and purposely lose, Heyman would bury Paul Bearer in cement. The Undertaker won and stopped Heyman from burying Bearer, but after claiming Bearer was merely a liability he had no use for, buried him himself.

The Undertaker began a feud with then WWE Champion John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) by challenging him to a title match at SummerSlam, which The Undertaker lost by disqualification. At No Mercy, The Undertaker and JBL competed in the first-ever Last Ride match, although The Undertaker lost after Heidenreich interfered. After defeating Heidenreich in a match at Survivor Series, The Undertaker turned his focus to the WWE Championship once again. Along with Eddie Guerrero and Booker T, he challenged JBL to a championship rematch at Armageddon in a fatal four-way match, in which The Undertaker was unsuccessful, again due to Heidenreich&#x27;s interference. The feud culminated in a casket match between The Undertaker and Heidenreich at the Royal Rumble, where The Undertaker sealed Heidenreich in a casket for the victory.

Soon after, Randy Orton challenged The Undertaker to a match at WrestleMania 21, uppishly proclaiming that he would end his WrestleMania winning Streak. Even with help from his father, Orton lost as The Undertaker improved his WrestleMania record to 13–0. After a two-month hiatus, The Undertaker returned on the June 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, but lost to JBL due to interference from Randy Orton, who was drafted to &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as part of the draft lottery. Despite his interference, the Randy Orton/Undertaker feud was put on the back burner until late summer of that year, resulting from Orton on the injured list.

In the meantime and in one of the most controversial moments in WWE history on an episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; taped on July 4, 2005 (aired on July 7), &quot;SmackDown!&quot; General Manager Theodore Long scheduled Muhammad Hassan in a match against The Undertaker at The Great American Bash, and placed Daivari in a match that night against Undertaker: Undertaker quickly defeated Daivari. After the match, however, Hassan began to &quot;pray&quot; on the ramp, summoning five masked men, dressed in black shirts, ski-masks and camouflage pants. Armed with clubs and a piano wire, the masked men assaulted and choked out The Undertaker before Hassan then placed The Undertaker in a camel clutch. Afterward, the masked men lifted Daivari above their heads and carried him away. Three days later, the London bombings took place. The footage aired unedited on UPN in the United States and on The Score in Canada with an advisory warning shown several times during the broadcast. It was removed from the Australian and European (including in the United Kingdom) broadcasts.

The angle elicited national attention in the &quot;New York Post&quot;, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; and other major media outlets. In response to the criticism, UPN decided that it would monitor the storyline closely and that it did not want the Hassan character on its network that week. In a promo hosted on WWE&#x27;s website—UPN had edited it from the July 14, 2005 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;—Hassan reiterated that he was an Arab American and that the American people automatically and unfairly assumed that he was a terrorist. Despite being in character, he referred to the real-world media coverage of the storyline, singling out the &quot;New York Post&#x27;s&quot; Don Kaplan by name and denouncing his description of the events on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, such as Kaplan&#x27;s comment of the masked men being &quot;Arabs in ski masks&quot;. On the July 14, 2005 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Hassan&#x27;s absence was explained by a statement delivered by his attorney, Thomas Whitney, that Hassan refused to appear on the show until The Great American Bash due to the way he was treated by the American media and WWE fans.

It was revealed in late July 2005 that UPN had pressured WWE to keep Hassan off their network, effectively removing him from &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Undertaker defeated Hassan at The Great American Bash to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, The Undertaker delivered a &quot;Last Ride&quot; through an open stage ramp onto a concrete floor to Hassan. It was reported that Hassan sustained serious injuries and had to be rushed to a nearby medical facility, writing Hassan off television. Several days later, Long (kayfabe) banned Hassan from &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. It was revealed years later that Hassan was about to receive a major push by winning the World Heavyweight Championship from Batista at SummerSlam and thus breaking Randy Orton&#x27;s record for being the youngest World Heavyweight Champion in WWE history.

On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, The Undertaker lost to JBL in a number-one contender&#x27;s match, once again due to interference from Orton, reviving their feud that was put on hiatus. At SummerSlam, Orton defeated The Undertaker in a WrestleMania rematch. The storyline intensified as the two tried to get into the head of one another with dark mind game tactics and use of caskets, leading to a handicap casket match at No Mercy, in which The Undertaker lost to Randy and his father &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob Orton. After the match, the Ortons poured gasoline on the casket and set it on fire (a throwback moment to one of The Undertaker&#x27;s most infamous attacks received and done by Kane doing the same to him at the 1998 Royal Rumble). When the charred casket was opened, however, The Undertaker was absent, presented as having vanished.

The Undertaker resurrected at the Survivor Series when the druids delivered a casket that was struck by lightning and went up in flames. The Undertaker then burst from the flaming casket in rage, battering and brutalizing an entire ring full of wrestlers as a message to Orton. Here, he reappeared still in hybrid form but with lessened Badass characteristics, eliminating several elements of his biker identity so that his Deadman side projected, most notably, replacing loose-fitting cargo pants with his Deadman spandex, and less use of the &quot;Last Ride&quot; finisher. The Undertaker returned on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in early December to haunt Orton and set up a Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon. After The Undertaker won their brutal Hell in a Cell encounter, in effect, settling his 9 month long feud with Orton, Calaway took a brief hiatus from professional wrestling.
In January 2006 at the Royal Rumble, The Undertaker returned on a horse-drawn cart during Kurt Angle&#x27;s celebration of his World Heavyweight Championship defense against Mark Henry. In this appearance, The Undertaker signaled for a title shot by using his supernatural powers to collapse the wrestling ring that Angle stood in as a means to spook him. As part of their storyline angle, The Undertaker lost his match with Angle at No Way Out after a 30-minute bout—described as underrated and among Undertaker&#x27;s top matches, in which he versatilely took to a more ground-based submission style to combat Angle&#x27;s trademarked freestyle wrestling. The Undertaker cornered Angle after the match and told him he was not finished with him. In a rematch with Angle (similarly described as underrated and among The Undertaker&#x27;s top matches that utilized the wrestling styles of their previous encounter on the March 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;) Henry attacked The Undertaker from behind, costing him the title. This led to The Undertaker challenging Henry to a casket match at WrestleMania 22 and Henry vowing to end The Undertaker&#x27;s WrestleMania winning Streak. The match resulted in The Undertaker sealing Henry in the casket, winning the match and extending his streak to 14–0 at WrestleMania. During a rematch on the next episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, The Undertaker was assaulted by the debuting Great Khali.

The Undertaker was not heard from until the May 5 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; when Theodore Long delivered a challenge from The Undertaker to Khali for a match at Judgment Day. The Undertaker lost to Khali at Judgment Day, and he did not appear again until the July 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; when he accepted Khali&#x27;s challenge to a Punjabi Prison match at The Great American Bash. However, Khali was removed from the match due to not being medically cleared. He was thus replaced by then ECW World Champion Big Show, over whom The Undertaker gained the victory. In storyline, Theodore Long replaced Khali with Big Show as punishment for an attack on The Undertaker shortly before the match. Khali was then challenged by The Undertaker to a Last Man Standing Match for SummerSlam after interfering in The Undertaker&#x27;s match with then World Heavyweight Champion King Booker. Khali refused the challenge but Long scheduled the Last Man Standing Match ahead of time, for the August 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; instead. The Undertaker won the match by striking Khali with steel stairs and finishing him with a chokeslam. It was Khali&#x27;s first defeat and effectively ended his feud with The Undertaker.

The Undertaker&#x27;s next match was with then United States Champion Mr. Kennedy at No Mercy, but was disqualified in the match after he hit Kennedy with the championship belt. On the November 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, The Undertaker reunited with Kane to reform the Brothers of Destruction for the first time in five years, defeating reluctant opposition in the form of Mr. Kennedy and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP), with whom Kane was feuding with at the time. As part of the storyline, Kennedy defeated The Undertaker in a First Blood match at Survivor Series after interference from MVP, but finally defeated Kennedy in a Last Ride match at Armageddon. The two continued to feud into 2007 as Kennedy cost The Undertaker two World Heavyweight Championship opportunities for a championship match at the Royal Rumble. However, The Undertaker eventually qualified for the 2007 Royal Rumble match, by winning a battle royal on the January 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (2007–2010) ====

The Undertaker won his first Royal Rumble match on January 28, in doing so becoming the first man to enter the Rumble at number 30 and win the match, after lastly eliminating Shawn Michaels. On the February 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Undertaker elected to face World Heavyweight Champion Batista at WrestleMania 23 on April 1, before attacking him with the chokeslam. At No Way Out on February 18, The Undertaker and Batista reluctantly teamed together to face John Cena and Shawn Michaels, but lost after Batista gained revenge on The Undertaker by hitting him with a spinebuster, allowing Cena to pin him. At WrestleMania 23, The Undertaker defeated Batista to win his first World Heavyweight Championship and extend his Streak to 15–0. The Undertaker faced Batista in a rematch at Backlash on April 29, this time in a Last Man Standing match. The match ended in a draw after neither man got to their feet by the referee&#x27;s count of ten, meaning The Undertaker retained the championship. The Undertaker and Batista then fought once again in a steel cage match on the May 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; that also ended in a draw when both men&#x27;s feet touched the floor at the same time. After the match, Mark Henry made his return by assaulting an already battered The Undertaker, after which Edge ran to the ring and cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase, forcing The Undertaker into a second title defense. Although he kicked out of two quick pin attempts, The Undertaker was pinned by Edge after two spears and lost the World Heavyweight Championship. After this match, The Undertaker took time off due to a torn right biceps.
During his rehabilitation, Henry bragged about his assault on The Undertaker, until vignettes began playing that promoted The Undertaker&#x27;s return. The Undertaker returned at Unforgiven on September 16, defeating Henry. Batista and The Undertaker reignited their feud at Cyber Sunday on October 28 with the fans choosing the special guest referee to be Stone Cold Steve Austin, however, Batista retained the World Heavyweight Championship. They battled again in a Hell in a Cell match at Survivor Series on November 18, where Edge returned and interfered to help Batista retain the World Heavyweight Championship. In response to this, The Undertaker delivered a &quot;Tombstone Piledriver&quot; to General Manager Vickie Guerrero on the November 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, sending her to the hospital. Returning assistant-General Manager Theodore Long declared a triple threat match for the title between the three men at Armageddon on December 16, which Edge won after interference from The Major Brothers.

At the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2008, The Undertaker competed in the Royal Rumble match itself, entering at number 1, but eliminated by Shawn Michaels after lasting for most of the bout. At No Way Out on February 17, The Undertaker defeated Batista, Finlay, The Great Khali, MVP and Big Daddy V in the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match to become the number one contender for Edge&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXIV on March 30. At WrestleMania, The Undertaker defeated Edge with the &quot;Hell&#x27;s Gate&quot; submission hold to win his second World Heavyweight Championship in what was his 16th WrestleMania win. In a WrestleMania rematch, The Undertaker defeated Edge once again at Backlash on April 27 to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Vickie Guerrero then banned The Undertaker&#x27;s &quot;Hell&#x27;s Gate&quot; submission hold and stripped him of the World Heavyweight Championship on the May 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. The Undertaker battled Edge for the vacant title at Judgment Day on May 18, which he won by countout. Guerrero ordered that the title remain vacant, because titles could not change hands in this way. Edge and The Undertaker faced each other again for the vacant championship at One Night Stand on June 1 in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, which The Undertaker lost after interference from La Familia. As a result of the stipulation, The Undertaker was forced to leave WWE.
On the July 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Vickie Guerrero reinstated The Undertaker and scheduled Edge to face him at SummerSlam on August 17 in a Hell in a Cell match, which The Undertaker won. After the match, The Undertaker chokeslammed Edge from the top of a ladder and through the ring canvas. Following this match, Guerrero tried making a peace offering with The Undertaker on &quot;SmackDown&quot; by apologizing, but The Undertaker told her that he was not the forgiving kind. At Unforgiven on September 7, as The Undertaker approached the ring to &quot;take Guerrero&#x27;s soul&quot; and seal her in a casket, Big Show, who appeared at first to be aiding The Undertaker ended up assaulting him. Resulting from that, The Undertaker and Big Show faced each other in a match at No Mercy on October 5, where Big Show won by knockout. At Cyber Sunday on October 26, The Undertaker defeated Big Show in a Last Man Standing match after choking him out with &quot;Hell&#x27;s Gate&quot;. At the same time, The Undertaker was engaged in a short feud with Jeff Hardy, who interfered during his match with Vladimir Kozlov on the November 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. Hardy defeated The Undertaker in an Extreme Rules match the following week on &quot;SmackDown&quot; due to interference from Big Show. The Undertaker then went on to defeat Big Show in a casket match at Survivor Series on November 23 and again in a steel cage match by submission on the December 5 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; to end their feud. At No Way Out on February 15, 2009, The Undertaker was part of the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match along with Triple H, Jeff Hardy, Big Show, Vladimir Kozlov and Edge; however, he was unsuccessful at winning the match as he was the runner-up behind Triple H.

In early 2009, The Undertaker began a second chapter to his unresolved feud with Shawn Michaels from the late 1990s, over a decade prior to this point (their tensions gradually increasing in the years immediately preceding this from heated run-ins at the 2007 and 2008 Royal Rumble matches). Their renewed feud by this point was two-dimensional, in part focusing on the wonder of The Undertaker&#x27;s undefeated WrestleMania Streak in relation to, however, the fact that he had never before defeated Michaels in a singles match, only vice versa. Michaels also made the buildup to their WrestleMania encounter personal, repeatedly demonstrating his Christian objections to the demonic dark side nature of The Undertaker&#x27;s Deadman gimmick, even creating his own heaven-esque bright side spin-off of what he felt The Undertaker&#x27;s gimmick should be (Michaels having become a real-life born again Christian by this point in his career). The feud culminated in a singles match between the two at WrestleMania 25 on April 5 in which Michaels made a heaven-sent entrance descending from up on high portraying his bright side anti-Deadman, while The Undertaker made a grave-risen entrance emerging from the ground. After what was widely described as a suspenseful, competitive match, The Undertaker defeated Michaels, thus extending his WrestleMania winning streak to 17–0. Their encounter was highly acclaimed by critics and audiences alike and is considered by many to be one of the greatest WrestleMania matches of all time. On the April 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, after losing a match against Big Show by knockout with Big Show taking advantage of The Undertaker&#x27;s battered neck state from his previous WrestleMania encounter, The Undertaker attacked Big Show. Following this, The Undertaker took another hiatus from the WWE.

After a four-month hiatus, The Undertaker returned at SummerSlam on August 23 by attacking CM Punk, who had just won the World Heavyweight Championship from Jeff Hardy in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. At Breaking Point on September 13, The Undertaker faced Punk in a submission match for the World Heavyweight Championship. The Undertaker had originally won the match with his &quot;Hell&#x27;s Gate&quot; submission hold, but the match was restarted by SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long, who ruled that the ban placed on the move by Vickie Guerrero was still in effect. Punk went on to win the match with his anaconda vise when referee Scott Armstrong called for the bell, despite The Undertaker never submitting—a recreation of the Montreal Screwjob, which took place in the same venue in 1997. On the September 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Theodore Long officially lifted the ban after being released from a casket that The Undertaker had him placed inside of, among a series of other horror-themed mind game tactics. With Long out of the way, the feud between The Undertaker and Punk pressed on and at Hell in a Cell on October 4, The Undertaker won the World Heavyweight Championship from him in a Hell in a Cell match. The Undertaker successfully defended the title against CM Punk on the October 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, in a fatal four-way match at Bragging Rights on October 25 against Punk, Batista and Rey Mysterio and in a triple threat match against Chris Jericho and Big Show at Survivor Series on November 22. He faced Batista at on December 13 in a chairs match for the championship and won when the match was restarted by Long, after Batista had originally won after utilizing a low blow. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, The Undertaker competed in a tournament to crown the 2009 Superstar of the Year, losing to Randy Orton by countout in the first round after a distraction by Orton&#x27;s protegès Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase.
After successfully defending the World Heavyweight Championship against Rey Mysterio at the Royal Rumble on January 31, 2010, The Undertaker lost the championship at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view on February 21. It was also at this event that a notorious shoot incident (non-kayfabe) befell The Undertaker: a pyrotechnics malfunction momentarily engulfed him in flames up to three times during his ring entrance. He was, however, able to continue with his scheduled match that night despite suffering first and second-degree burns on his chest and neck. According to a WWE spokesman, it &quot;looked like a bad sunburn&quot;. The Undertaker lost the title to Chris Jericho after interference from Shawn Michaels that night; Jericho has said on multiple occasions that the pyrotechnician responsible for the accident was immediately escorted from the arena and relieved of his employment with WWE, following a threat of violence from Calaway. Calaway himself explained that he had previously expressed concerns to the technician regarding the pyro arrangement, but was ignored. He feels he was saved from severe injury by applying water to his hair, and altering his attire from a sleeveless to a sleeved jacket, just minutes before the accident.

The Undertaker then accepted Michaels&#x27;s rematch offer, after initially declining, at WrestleMania XXVI on March 28 in a Streak vs. Career match, where The Undertaker was victorious and Shawn Michaels was forced to retire. This match also made both The Undertaker and Michaels the first men in WWE history to main event WrestleMania in three different decades (Undertaker main evented WrestleMania 13 and XXIV in 1997 and 2008 and Michaels main evented WrestleMania XII and XIV in 1996 and 1998 and XX and 23 in 2004 and 2007, respectively). After a hiatus (which included wrestling two matches on &quot;Raw&quot;), he returned to &quot;SmackDown&quot; on May 28, defeating Rey Mysterio to qualify for a spot at the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view on June 20 to compete for the World Heavyweight title. During the Rey Mysterio match, The Undertaker suffered a concussion, broken orbital bone and broken nose; he was visibly bleeding profusely on camera by the end of this match. To cover for the injury, Kane revealed that The Undertaker had been found in a vegetative state on the June 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;; Mysterio took his place in the match and won the World Heavyweight Championship. While attempting to learn which wrestler had attacked The Undertaker, Kane defeated Mysterio to win the World Heavyweight Championship at Money in the Bank. Kane and Mysterio continued to clash as they accused one another of being the assailant behind the mysterious ambush of The Undertaker.

At SummerSlam on August 15, The Undertaker returned to confront Kane and Rey Mysterio, only to be attacked with a &quot;Tombstone Piledriver&quot; by Kane. With Kane revealed as his attacker, the two feuded for the next few months over the World Heavyweight Championship. After losing to Kane in a No Holds Barred match at Night of Champions on September 19, Paul Bearer returned as The Undertaker&#x27;s manager on the September 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. However, Bearer turned on him at Hell in a Cell on October 3 to help Kane win once again in a Hell in a Cell match. The feud ended at Bragging Rights on October 24 when The Nexus helped Kane defeat The Undertaker in a Buried Alive match (the half-brothers&#x27; final singles match against one another). The Undertaker needed surgery for a torn rotator cuff, causing him to be written off.

==== Final years of The Streak (2011–2014) ====

After the 2011 Royal Rumble, promotional videos began airing, showing The Undertaker entering and standing within a Western-style, dilapidated shack on a rainy desert in Death Valley, The birthplace. Each promo ended with the date 2–21–11 being &quot;burned into&quot; the screen. On the February 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Undertaker returned, but before he could speak, Triple H also returned and confronted him. The two challenged each other to a match at WrestleMania XXVII, which was later made a No Holds Barred match and which The Undertaker won by submission. However, he had to be carried away from the ring on a stretcher. Following WrestleMania XXVII in 2011, The Undertaker would take on a more part-time role within the company; he would not have another match on &quot;Raw&quot; or &quot;SmackDown&quot; until 2013.
On the January 30, 2012 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, The Undertaker returned after a nine-month hiatus to confront Triple H. On the February 13 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, Triple H refused The Undertaker&#x27;s challenge for a WrestleMania rematch. After The Undertaker accused Triple H of living in the shadow of Shawn Michaels on the February 20 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, Triple H accepted the challenge on the condition that it would be a Hell in a Cell match; Michaels was later inserted as guest referee in the match. At WrestleMania XXVIII, The Undertaker, while debuting his new look, a mohawk, defeated Triple H to extend his Streak to 20–0. After the match, The Undertaker and Michaels carried Triple H to the entrance stage, where the three embraced. Later in 2012, The Undertaker appeared on the 1000th episode of &quot;Raw&quot; on July 23 to help Kane, who had been confronted by Jinder Mahal, Curt Hawkins, Tyler Reks, Hunico, Camacho and Drew McIntyre. The Brothers of Destruction overcame and dominated the six other wrestlers.

The Undertaker&#x27;s next television appearance was on &quot;Old School Raw&quot; on March 4, 2013, where he opened the show by performing his signature entrance. CM Punk, Randy Orton, Big Show and Sheamus fought in a fatal four-way match to determine who would face him at WrestleMania 29, which Punk won. After the real-life death of Paul Bearer on March 5, 2013, a storyline involving Punk regularly spiting The Undertaker through displays of flippancy and disrespect towards Bearer&#x27;s death began. Punk interrupted The Undertaker&#x27;s ceremony to honor Bearer on &quot;Raw&quot;, stealing the trademark urn and later using it to attack Kane, humiliate The Brothers of Destruction and mock Bearer. The Undertaker defeated Punk at WrestleMania 29 to extend his Streak to 21–0 and then took back the urn. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, The Undertaker came out to pay his respects to Bearer, but was interrupted by The Shield, who attempted to attack Undertaker before Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan) made the save. The Undertaker would wrestle his final &quot;Raw&quot; match (his first since 2010) on the April 22 episode, teaming with Kane and Bryan against The Shield in a losing effort. Four days later, he wrestled his final &quot;SmackDown&quot; match (also his first since 2010), defeating Shield member Dean Ambrose by submission. Afterward, The Undertaker was attacked by Ambrose and the rest of The Shield, who performed a triple powerbomb through the broadcast table on him.
On the February 24, 2014, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Undertaker returned to confront Brock Lesnar and accepted his challenge for a match at WrestleMania XXX. After 25 minutes and three &quot;F-5&quot;s, Lesnar won the match at WrestleMania by pinfall, ending The Undertaker&#x27;s Streak in what was described as &quot;the most shocking result in WWE history&quot;. Following the match, The Undertaker was hospitalized with a severe concussion which he suffered in the first minutes of the match. In a December 2014 interview, Vince McMahon confirmed that it was his final decision to have Lesnar end The Streak and that The Undertaker was initially shocked at the decision. McMahon justified his decision that it would significantly enhance Lesnar&#x27;s formidability to set up the next WrestleMania event and that there were no other viable candidates to fill Lesnar&#x27;s role. In 2014, The Undertaker was also offered to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, but he declined the offer, feeling it wasn&#x27;t time yet.

==== Final feuds (2015–2020) ====

In February 2015, Bray Wyatt began a series of cryptic promos which led to Fastlane, where Wyatt challenged The Undertaker to a match at WrestleMania 31, which The Undertaker accepted. At WrestleMania, The Undertaker defeated Wyatt after two &quot;Tombstone Piledrivers&quot;.

At Battleground in July, The Undertaker made his return by attacking Lesnar as he was on the verge of defeating Seth Rollins during his WWE World Heavyweight Championship match, causing the match to end in a disqualification win for Lesnar. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, The Undertaker explained his actions as revenge, not against Lesnar breaking The Streak, but rather the constant taunting he allowed Paul Heyman to engage in. Later that night, after The Undertaker and Lesnar brawled throughout the arena and had to be separated, a rematch was scheduled for SummerSlam in August, where The Undertaker controversially defeated Lesnar. Lesnar put The Undertaker in a kimura lock and the timekeeper rang the bell after seeing The Undertaker supposedly indicating submission, but since the referee had not seen a submission and never stopped the match, the match continued. The confusion allowed The Undertaker to surprise Lesnar with a low blow and apply &quot;Hell&#x27;s Gate&quot;, in which Lesnar passed out. At Hell in a Cell, The Undertaker was defeated by Lesnar in a Hell in a Cell match after Lesnar hit him with his own low blow, returning the favor, and executing what was his third &quot;F-5&quot; of the match.

While the crowd gave The Undertaker an ovation after his loss to Lesnar, he was attacked and captured by The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Luke Harper, Erick Rowan and Braun Strowman), who carried him away from the ring. After ambushing and capturing Kane the next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Wyatt explained that he had claimed their souls and stole their demonic powers. The Brothers of Destruction returned on the November 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and attacked The Wyatt Family, setting up a tag team match at Survivor Series, which honored The Undertaker&#x27;s 25 years in WWE. At Survivor Series on November 22, the Brothers of Destruction defeated Wyatt and Harper.

On the February 22, 2016, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Vince McMahon placed his son Shane McMahon, who returned to WWE for the first time since 2009, in a Hell in a Cell match at WrestleMania 32 against The Undertaker with the stipulation that if Shane won, he would gain control of &quot;Raw&quot;. Vince later decided that should Undertaker lose the match against Shane, it would be his final match at WrestleMania. After weeks of random physical confrontations and mind games exchanged between the pair, The Undertaker defeated Shane McMahon at WrestleMania 32. The Undertaker would not appear again until the 900th episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; on November 15, issuing a threat to Team SmackDown if they failed to defeat Team Raw at the upcoming Survivor Series pay-per-view.
The Undertaker appeared on the January 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, confronting Brock Lesnar and Goldberg. During the Royal Rumble on January 29, The Undertaker entered at number 29, eliminating Goldberg, The Miz, Baron Corbin and Sami Zayn, before being eliminated by the number 30 entrant, Roman Reigns. The Undertaker returned on the March 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and performed a chokeslam on Reigns. This led to a No Holds Barred match between The Undertaker and Reigns at WrestleMania 33, in which The Undertaker lost to Reigns after five spears in his fourth WrestleMania main event. After the match, The Undertaker left his gloves, coat and hat in the center of the ring before slowly making his exit.

The Undertaker took part in the &quot;Raw 25 Years&quot; broadcast on January 22, 2018, his first post-WrestleMania 33 appearance. In the months prior to WrestleMania 34, John Cena challenged The Undertaker to a singles match. At WrestleMania, after Elias confronted Cena and was beaten down, The Undertaker&#x27;s hat and coat appeared in the center of the ring and were struck by lightning. The Undertaker then appeared and beat Cena in a three-minute squash match. Three weeks later, The Undertaker defeated Rusev at WWE&#x27;s Greatest Royal Rumble event in a casket match. At Super Show-Down in Australia on October 6, The Undertaker faced Triple H in a no disqualification match billed as the &quot;Last Time Ever&quot;; they were accompanied by Kane and Shawn Michaels, respectively. The Undertaker lost the match after interference from Michaels. After the match, the four men shook hands as a sign of respect, however, The Undertaker and Kane would follow this by attacking them. As a result, the duos reunited their respective tag teams—the Brothers of Destruction and D-Generation X—and faced each other at Crown Jewel on November 2, where The Undertaker and Kane lost their final match as a tag team.

On the April 8, 2019 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the night after WrestleMania 35—the first WrestleMania in 19 years without his involvement—The Undertaker appeared to interrupt and attack Elias during a musical performance. The Undertaker made his return to the ring to face Goldberg at Super ShowDown in Saudi Arabia on June 7, defeating him in the main event of the night in their first match against each other. On the June 24, 2019 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, during a handicap match in which Roman Reigns was dominated by Shane McMahon and Drew McIntyre, The Undertaker suddenly appeared and attacked McMahon and McIntyre. The Undertaker and Reigns were later scheduled to face McMahon and McIntyre in a No Holds Barred tag team match at Extreme Rules. At Extreme Rules, The Undertaker and Reigns won. This turned out to be The Undertaker&#x27;s final match in front of a live audience in the United States.

The Undertaker returned at Super ShowDown in Saudi Arabia on February 27, 2020, as a surprise replacement in a gauntlet match. He entered the match last, replacing Rey Mysterio and defeating AJ Styles to win the Tuwaiq Mountain Trophy. At Elimination Chamber during a match between Styles and Aleister Black, The Undertaker made another surprise appearance with an attack on Styles. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Styles challenged The Undertaker to a match at WrestleMania 36. Over the following weeks that led up to WrestleMania, a resentful Styles made unprecedented efforts to expose The Undertaker, going so far as departing from bashing his Deadman gimmick, instead taking to a metafiction form of bashing Calaway himself. The feud saw Styles solely referring to The Undertaker by his real name, Mark Calaway, referencing his age and his wife, Michelle McCool. In response, The Undertaker cut promos of ominous warning against Styles in which for the first time in years, he broke from the Deadman gimmick by presenting as himself out of character. In doing so, elements of his American Badass gimmick were reflected with Calaway making appearances in his biker gear. At WrestleMania 36, The Undertaker presented his third and final identity, &quot;The Unholy Trinity,&quot; a combination of The Deadman, American Badass, and himself as Mark Calaway, this blend allowing him to trash talk Styles over real life matters during their encounter, while also able to maintain his superhuman horror capabilities. In what was subsequently learned to be The Undertaker&#x27;s final match, he and Styles fought in a cemetery at a secluded rural locale, competing in what was a cinematic, narrative-heavy brawl similar to &quot;Buried Alive matches&quot;, named the &quot;Boneyard match&quot;. Despite the assistance of Gallows and Anderson, The Undertaker buried Styles in the grave to win this match and ride off on motorcycle into the sunset, scoring his 25th WrestleMania victory to complete his professional wrestling career.

==== Retirement and Hall of Fame (2020–2022) ====
On June 21, 2020, in the final episode of the &quot;Undertaker: The Last Ride&quot; documentary, Callaway retired from the professional wrestling industry. Later on that November, he confirmed that he was &quot;officially retired&quot; in an interview. Many wrestlers and other public figures paid tribute to him on their social media pages. Madison Square Garden, regarded as the most famous venue in professional wrestling, also paid tribute to him.

Undertaker, wearing his trademark mortician trench coat and stetson hat, made an appearance at the conclusion of the Survivor Series event on November 22, 2020. The event is dedicated to him, commemorating thirty years from that time since his WWE debut. There, he reiterated that his career had been completed, giving an emotional farewell speech which ended in typical Undertaker fashion: &quot;My time has come to let The Undertaker &quot;Rest in Peace&quot;.&quot; A ten-bell salute was also given for The Undertaker character as he did his traditional take-the-knee pose, and a holographic image of Paul Bearer, Undertaker&#x27;s former manager, was projected in the ring.

News that the Undertaker would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2022 were responded to with extensive praise from WWE fans, the professional wrestling community and media outlets alike. On March 3, 2022, on &quot;The Pat McAfee Show&quot;, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon stated that he would be Undertaker&#x27;s WWE Hall of Fame inductor. In praising Undertaker both inside and outside of character in a heartfelt message, McMahon said that the induction would be one of the most difficult endeavors of his life because of his longtime history with Undertaker, and how close they were behind the scenes. Undertaker issued a Twitter response later on that same day, which read:

On April 1, 2022, The Undertaker was formally inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame at the American Airlines Center. At his induction, Calaway made a 137-minute speech that opened with a 10-minute, emotional standing ovation from the live audience, bringing Calaway to tears. Calaway&#x27;s acceptance speech, hailed by media outlets as matchless and beyond compare, was motivational and shared his collection of self-reflections and life philosophies for success. In making his speech, he stood before several genres of his Deadman character, through the varying costumes displayed on mannequins. Later that same weekend, Calaway made appearances on the entrance stage on both nights of WrestleMania.

====Sporadic appearances (2023–present)====
On January 23, 2023, The Undertaker made an appearance at the Monday Night Raw 30th Anniversary special, Raw is XXX. He appeared under his American Badass gimmick, confronting LA Knight and seemingly giving his approval to Bray Wyatt. On October 10, 2023, The Undertaker made his first appearance on WWE NXT chokeslamming Bron Breakker.

On April 5, 2024, The Undertaker inducted Muhammad Ali into the 2024 WWE Hall of Fame. On April 7, 2024, The Undertaker appeared briefly during the Night 2 main event of WrestleMania XL between Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes where he aided Cody Rhodes and chokeslammed The Rock. On the Raw premiere on Netflix on January 6, 2025, The Undertaker made an appearance under his American Badass persona and congratulated the new Women&#x27;s World Champion Rhea Ripley after her victory.

==Undertaker gimmick, identities and character evolution==
===The Deadman identity===

Under his undead, , and macabre horror-themed gimmick, in which The Undertaker is subtitled &quot;The Deadman&quot;, he routinely took to alarmist tactics to disrupt the focus and confidence of his rivals. Often, these alarmist tactics were morbid and applied the use of props that reflected demise as the consequence of a wrestling match against him: caskets (sometimes personalizing casket designs to represent his opponents), body bags, corpse-like effigies, cemeteries, hearses. To that end, the gimmick evoked funerals and death down to finer details, such as in the character&#x27;s birthplace of Death Valley, catchphrase of &quot;Rest in Peace&quot;, signature finishing maneuver of the Tombstone Piledriver, a wrestling pin that had the opponent resemble a corpse with their arms crossed over their chest, etc. Adding to his many effects of treating his wrestling matches as funeral services, The Undertaker frequently served a list of specialized matches that were personalized to his Deadman gimmick: Casket Match, Body Bag Match, Buried Alive Match, Last Ride Match, Hell in a Cell, Boneyard Match, etc.

Filled with , The Undertaker&#x27;s godlike superhuman presence and indignation were signaled by funeral tolls, settings of pitch-black darkness and blue/purple semidarkness, flickering lights, hazy fog, thunder, lightning strikes, and other bone-chilling scenes and sound activity. Portrayed as miraculously resilient to destruction, The Undertaker yielded numerous resurrections, which sometimes gave way to reincarnations of his Deadman gimmick. While maintaining his general character premise as death personified with accompanying alarmist tactics throughout all sagas of the Deadman, each incarnation took on its own distinct appearance and characterization. For example, some Deadman incarnations were unearthly and zombie-like while others were Goth and comparatively more human.

The earliest of The Undertaker&#x27;s Deadman incarnations (nicknamed in external media as &quot;The Old West Mortician&quot; to distinguish from his other Deadman incarnations) depicted him as a menacing derivative of the Wild West undertakers in television westerns. In his own rendition, he was garbed in a black trench coat; gray-striped tie; black-ribboned, black stetson; gray boot spats; and gray gloves (black gloves for first few appearances before gray). However, most of The Undertaker&#x27;s Deadman character development (sleeve tattoos, longer/straightened/black hair, purple/blue color representation, elements of thunder and lightning, etc.) would not surface until his first reincarnation into what was his rebirthed Deadman variation, lasting from SummerSlam 94&#x27; (resurrection from a death angle with Yokozuna) through Buried Alive: In Your House (The Undertaker buried alive by Mankind and numerous other WWF heel wrestlers). In these initial zombie-like incarnations of his gimmick, he was portrayed as impervious to pain, something accomplished by Calaway not selling his opponents&#x27; attacks. Among the many ways this was showcased was The Undertaker&#x27;s maneuver of raising up from a taken down supine position into a high Fowler&#x27;s position, dubbed &quot;the sit-up&quot; (often accompanied by his sharp hissing sound).

Beginning early on, The Undertaker&#x27;s persona was complemented with histrionically spooky, wailing manager Paul Bearer, introduced to represent and guide The Deadman. Playing a key role, Bearer used an urn to transmit mysterious powers to The Undertaker that had supernatural healing effects on him during combat. Also linked to The Undertaker&#x27;s Deadman gimmick were the druids–a team of mysterious, incognito cult-like members, completely disguised in black hooded clergy robes. A mysterious choir chanting sounded whenever the druids presented. The druids typically appeared for the purposes of removing The Undertaker where he had seemingly been extinguished by his enemies (as opposed to EMTs or medical personnel used for the rest of WWF/E talent). The druids were also seen reproducing The Undertaker in recovered, wrathful states to those same enemies who were thought to have extinguished him.

The Undertaker took to many trademarked idiosyncrasies and themes, including a stylized throat-slashing gesture, grimacing facial expressions fit with eyeballs rolled back so that only the whites of his eyes displayed, backwards hair-whips so as to expose his ominous facial expressions, fixed stares on adversaries, protruding tongue displays, jolting of his head with a fury so that it faced the direction of his antagonists, his celebratory take-the-knee pose, sonorous vocalizations, collectively labeling his fanbase as &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;, voice of God-like promos in which things were interrupted with dimmed lights and thunder while The Undertaker&#x27;s communications were heard booming throughout the arena with no physical trace of him; messages filled with death threats of a deeply posthumous insight into impending corpse decomposition, maggot feasting, unsouling and so on. A main attraction of the Deadman gimmick, The Undertaker mesmerized his opponents and viewers alike through elaborately &quot;bone-chilling&quot; entrances. The character&#x27;s godlike powers were routinely put on display in these moments, triggering lights back to the arena either gradually or suddenly dependent on his either slowly or abruptly raised arms. During the vast majority of his wrestling career as the Deadman, The Undertaker used an extended remix of Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Funeral March as his theme music. WWF Composer Jim Johnston embellished on the Chopin march, using the historic melody as a pre- and post-chorus to a main chorus of bell tolls, along with an original transition section to the song of a slow, instrumental feel. Of his entrances, Calaway has stated, &quot;When that gong went off, that was go time. The music fit the character. That&#x27;s the key element of it: the end is at hand for whoever&#x27;s going to be standing in that ring waiting for me to come down. That was the mindset behind the gong. And the music was just doom and gloom, you knew what was coming.&quot;

===Alternate identities of The Undertaker gimmick===
After a hiatus, Calaway returned in 2000 adopting a human form of the Undertaker gimmick. Under the character&#x27;s alter ego, he is a semifictional smack-talking, redneck biker, thoroughly absent of his fully fictional Deadman zombie-like traits and wizardry. In performing this alternate identity, he rode to the ring on motorcycles, chewed tobacco, donned cargo garments and/or denim, printed shirts, and sporty fashion accessories (sunglasses, necklaces, bandanas). His theme music was replaced with popular rock songs of the time, initially Kid Rock&#x27;s &quot;American Bad Ass&quot; (from which The Undertaker&#x27;s subtitle used to refer to this second identity derived), and eventually Limp Bizkit&#x27;s &quot;Rollin&#x27; (Air Raid Vehicle)&quot;. His American Badass catch phrases, such as threats of “I&#x27;ll make you famous” or references to the wrestling ring as his “yard”, became popular during this era. According to Bruce Prichard, Calaway requested this metamorphosis of character since he wanted to be &quot;the biker–he wanted to be the guy that he is in everyday life&quot;.

While explained off-screen for the above reason years later, Calaway&#x27;s sudden appearance as American Badass Undertaker after hiatus in which he left off as Deadman Undertaker was never explained within WWE storylines or the WWE&#x27;s fictional universe. Rather, the expectation was for fans to just go with it. This transition lasted years until 2004 when The Undertaker resurrected his Deadman identity in hybrid form—residual features of his American Badass identity remaining. Among subtle details left over from his biker identity were his in-ring MMA style between his stances, strikes, and submissions; penchant to sporadically lower his tank top for a barechested appearance; celebrating victories with an arm-raised fist; etc. This hybrid Deadman (Deadman incarnation most closely based on Calaway himself) would last many years and for the remainder of The Undertaker&#x27;s professional wrestling career, excluding his final wrestling match. For The Undertaker&#x27;s final encounter, a Boneyard Match at WrestleMania 36 in 2020, he introduced a three-dimensional identity that brought all of his identities into one, dubbed &quot;The Unholy Trinity:&quot; a mix of his Deadman identity, American Badass identity, and his natural and genuine identity as Mark Calaway.

===Gimmick reflective nicknames===
The Undertaker generated many nicknames from commentators throughout the course of his active wrestling career, some of those names more associated with his Deadman Undertaker identity, including &quot;The Grim Reaper&quot; (variants of this used were &quot;The Reaper&quot; and &quot;The Reaper of Wayward Souls&quot;), &quot;The Demon of Death Valley&quot;, &quot;The Man from the Dark Side&quot;, &quot;The Prince of Darkness&quot;, &quot;The Lord of Darkness&quot;. He also generated nicknames associated with his American Badass Undertaker identity, including &quot;Big Evil&quot; (used in reference to his American Badass heel side), &quot;Booger Red&quot;. Some of his nicknames were not identity specific but used for the character in general, such as &quot;The Phenom&quot;.

===Domestic backstory, parents and brother===

The Undertaker&#x27;s gimmick has a dark and disturbed family backstory which involves him intentionally burning down his family funeral home as a teenager, resulting in the deaths of his parents and purportedly a brother of his as well. Undertaker initially denied his then ex-manager Paul Bearer&#x27;s charges of him committing the arson murder of his family, (though later confessed in late 1998). Instead, Undertaker blamed his younger brother of whom he thought long dead from the incident, describing him as a &quot;pyromaniac&quot;. This led to Bearer&#x27;s shocking warnings to proof in the form of the brother, &quot;Kane&quot;, as alive and well. In late 1997 at In Your House Badd Blood, Bearer unleashed a vengeful Kane: the fire-personified, juggernaut half-brother of Undertaker, who was fit with a mask to conceal the scarring from Undertaker&#x27;s arson. In what became a fickle sibling relationship with Bearer (later revealed to be Kane&#x27;s father) only adding to the pendulum and complexities, Undertaker and Kane went back and forth from one extreme to the other, feuding barbarically at points and yet teaming as the Brothers of Destruction at other points. In the duo&#x27;s final feud in late 2009 through 2010, Kane emerged victorious in all of their matches.

===Gimmick fused with wrestling move set and style===
The Undertaker&#x27;s wrestling performance and move set were carried out with significant amounts of character-driven physical theater and kinesics. In keeping with his Deadman routine for example, Undertaker was forbiddingly slow and measured in much of his maneuvering and offense. Taking his opponents and audience by surprise, however, he combined his slow, measured physicality with wrestling moves and action uncharacteristic of a wrestler of his vast height and weight. Not limited to just ground offense and power moves, Undertaker was conspicuously aerial, swift, agile, loose-limbed and animated in the other half of his wrestling style and move set: flying clotheslines, guillotine leg drops, running DDTs, ability to land on his feet poised and motionless if thrown from the ring, over-the-top-rope suicide dives (on one occasion, over the top rope and combined active flames during an Inferno match at ), etc. During matches, Undertaker would also pay homage to Don Jardine by performing an arm twist ropewalk chop, dubbed &quot;Old School.&quot;

===Calaway&#x27;s performance of The Deadman===
Most famed for his Deadman Undertaker identity in particular, the role won Calaway the Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards for Best Gimmick a record-setting 5 years in a row (1990–1994). Calaway was highly protective of his Deadman public image: for the vast majority of his career while performing the gimmick, he was so private that he wasn&#x27;t seen outside of character in the media. Calaway&#x27;s approach of presenting only in character publicly was done in order to maintain the mystique of the Deadman and facilitate disbelief suspension. However, during the last few years of his wrestling career, he allowed himself to be seen out of character, giving interviews as Mark Calaway and filming a documentary called &quot;The Last Ride&quot;.

== Legacy and reception ==
===Recognitions and acclaim===

The Undertaker has been named one of the greatest wrestlers of all time; and the greatest character, and most iconic figure, in WWE history. He was voted the greatest WWE wrestler ever in a 2013 Digital Spy poll. In naming him the second greatest wrestler ever, IGN described Undertaker as, &quot;one of the most respected wrestlers, and characters, in the business; treated with actual reverence. Like a cherished, invaluable artifact&quot;. Luis Paez-Pumar of &quot;Complex&quot; wrote that the Undertaker character is &quot;easily the best gimmick in the history of professional wrestling&quot;. Luke Winkie of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; listed Undertaker as the fifth greatest wrestler of all time. His consecutive matches with Shawn Michaels at WrestleManias XXV and XXVI were met with critical acclaim, with both matches winning the &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; awards for Match of the Year in 2009 and 2010 respectively. His Hell in a cell match with Triple H at WrestleMania XXVIII won the 2012 Slammy Award for the match of the year as well as being voted the match of the year on Pro Wrestling Illustrated.

Wrestler Big Show named The Undertaker as the greatest professional wrestler of all time, while Mark Henry and WWE chairman Vince McMahon have called him their favorite. WWE Hall of Famer and former company executive, Jim Ross, said: &quot;Without question, The Undertaker is the greatest big man in the history of wrestling... There is no greater WWE star ever than The Undertaker&quot;.

&quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; recognized Undertaker as having the most consecutive victories at WrestleMania in 2016. In November 2015, &quot;Telegraph&quot; journalist Tom Fordy called Undertaker &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest sportsman&quot;. The Undertaker is also one of two wrestlers (the other being The Rock) that has main evented WrestleMania in four different decades: 1990s: 13 (1997); 2000s: XXIV (2008); 2010s: XXVI (2010), 33 (2017); 2020s: 36 (2020).

Undertaker&#x27;s Deadman character in particular has been praised as one of the best in professional wrestling. He received the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;&#x27;s Best Gimmick award from 1990 to 1994. Tim Friorvant of ESPN named Undertaker &quot;a character that has been a cornerstone of the WWE for more than three decades&quot;. Shawn Valentino of &quot;Pro Wrestling Torch&quot; said &quot;The Undertaker may have been the greatest character in the history of professional wrestling&quot;.

A 12-minute match between Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin drew a 9.5 rating on June 28, 1999. It stands as the highest-rated segment in &quot;Raw&quot; history.

=== Reception to later career ===

In contrast to the high praise The Undertaker received during the vast majority of his professional wrestling career, he was heavily criticized for continuing to perform throughout the latter part of his wrestling career, particularly after his first defeat at WrestleMania in 2014. Calaway would later reveal that after suffering a severe concussion in his WrestleMania match against Lesnar, he lost his confidence. At WrestleMania 33, after his second defeat against Roman Reigns, Luis Paez-Pumar of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that Undertaker &quot;should have retired when The Streak was broken&quot; but &quot;lived on to pass the rub on to Reigns in the sloppiest, saddest manner possible&quot;. Undertaker himself said he was disappointed by his performance against Reigns. After his match against John Cena at WrestleMania 34, IGN posted an article titled &quot;Undertaker&#x27;s return was awesome, but now he needs to retire&quot;. After his match at Crown Jewel in November 2018, &quot;Pro Wrestling Torch&quot;″s Wade Keller wrote that Undertaker looked &quot;brittle&quot; and Jason Powell of &quot;Pro Wrestling Dot Net&quot; said &quot;they [Undertaker, Kane, Michaels and Triple H] need to accept their limitations, stop pretending they belong in main events, and stop acting like being in these main events isn&#x27;t stealing the spotlight&quot;. His subsequent match with Goldberg at Super ShowDown in June 2019 was also widely pilloried, with Bryan Rose of the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; calling it &quot;sad more than anything&quot;. In reviewing the show, Dave Meltzer of the same publication wrote that Goldberg &quot;has juice left, while Undertaker doesn&#x27;t&quot;. Undertaker himself called the match &quot;a disaster&quot; in 2020.

Despite the media criticism, two of Undertaker&#x27;s later matches—teaming with Roman Reigns against Drew McIntyre and Shane McMahon at Extreme Rules 2019, as well as his cinematic Boneyard match against AJ Styles at WrestleMania 36—were both widely praised, with critics citing both matches as his best performances in recent years. The former would be ranked #25 on WWE.com&#x27;s 25 best matches of 2019, and the latter was ranked #1 on WWE.com&#x27;s 25 best matches of 2020. The Boneyard match would also win WWE&#x27;s Half-Year Award for best Cinematic Match, as well as winning the Slammy Award for 2020&#x27;s Match of the Year.
== Personal life ==

Calaway married Jodi Lynn in 1989. They had a son in 1993 and divorced in 1999. Calaway married Sara Frank in 2000, and she made televised appearances with WWE in 2001 as part of a feud between Calaway and Diamond Dallas Page, in which she was acknowledged as Calaway&#x27;s wife. They had two daughters before divorcing in 2007. In 2010, Calaway married former professional wrestler Michelle McCool. They have a daughter born in 2012 and an adopted son.

In the 1990s, Calaway started a backstage &quot;posse&quot; called the Bone Street Krew which consisted of some of his best friends and fellow wrestlers Yokozuna, Savio Vega, Charles Wright, The Godwinns, and Rikishi. Each member had the initials &quot;BSK&quot; tattooed onto themselves, with Calaway&#x27;s prominently marked across his stomach.

Calaway is a fan of boxing and mixed martial arts, which he incorporated into his onscreen character. He has practiced Brazilian jiu-jitsu and earned a black belt in 2011. He invests in real estate with his business partner, Scott Everhart. The two finished construction on a $2.7 million building in Loveland, Colorado, called &quot;The Calahart&quot; (a portmanteau of their last names), in 2007. A dog lover, Calaway and his ex-wife Sara established The Zeus Compton Calaway Save the Animals Fund at the Texas A&amp;M College of Veterinary Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences to help pay for lifesaving treatments for large dogs.

In June 2020, Calaway expressed support for the Blue Lives Matter movement. Later that year, Dave Meltzer reported that Calaway had made several donations totaling $7,000 to Donald Trump&#x27;s re-election campaign. In February 2021, Calaway stated that he would endorse fellow wrestler Dwayne Johnson if he were to ever run for president, expressing that he felt Johnson could be the great &quot;uniter&quot; and ease the American political divide. Calaway and Glenn Jacobs endorsed Trump in the 2024 United States presidential election, appearing in a TikTok with him which featured them calling out fellow wrestler Dave Bautista, who had been outspoken against Trump.

==In other media==
Calaway made his acting debut as Hutch in the 1991 film &quot;Suburban Commando&quot;. He had guest roles on &quot;&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;. In 2002, he appeared on the Canadian sports show &quot;Off the Record with Michael Landsberg&quot;.

On January 15, 2022, Donald Trump used The Undertaker&#x27;s theme music as part of his &quot;Save America&quot; rally held in Florence, Arizona. The song that was played incorporates funeral bell tolls and was created by WWE composer Jim Johnston as an embellished remix of &quot;Funeral March&quot;. During the rally, the song was accompanied by a music video playing on large screens, advancing through multitudes of scenes intended to alarm the public of looming danger resulting from the presidency of Trump&#x27;s successor Joe Biden. The song continued to play out for 30 seconds following the attack ad against Biden, ending just short of Trump making his entrance. Other than his music being played, Calaway was not reported to have any association with the affair, though he had previously donated to Trump&#x27;s campaign in 2020 and would later endorse him in 2024.

===Filmography===


==Video games==
Calaway&#x27;s WWE character has been included in numerous WWE video games, beginning with &quot;WWF Super WrestleMania&quot; (1992). A special Undertaker-themed version of &quot;WWE 2K14&quot; was released in 2013. The Undertaker is also the most featured wrestler in WWF/E&#x27;s video game collection, having been presented on every game in the franchise:

<text>Lo Fidelity Allstars are an English electronic music group who have recorded since the late 1990s.

==Career==
Their members originate from various cities in Northern England. They were formed in Leeds before relocating first to London, where they came to the attention of major record labels. After signing to Skint Records the band relocated to Brighton on the south coast, where that label is based. Subsequent to parting company with Skint, the band liquidated their Brighton studio complex &#x27;The Brainfarm&#x27;, and the personnel are now based variously in Brighton, The Midlands and New York.

Their earlier work is noted for genre-crossing stylings, distorted, morose, and at times alien lyrics, distinctive funk bass lines, and extensive use of lo-fi recording practices. This work is best exemplified by their 1998 debut album&quot; How to Operate with a Blown Mind&quot; on Skint Records. At this time, the Lo Fidelity Allstars were credited by pseudonyms rather than their actual names. After its release, the band&#x27;s lead vocalist David Randall (credited as The Wrekked Train) left, shortly followed by the keyboard player &quot;Sheriff&quot; John Stone. For their second studio album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid of Love&quot;, the members of the band discarded their pseudonyms in favor of using their real names.

Before the split, they recorded a mix album &quot;On the Floor at the Boutique&quot; (a follow-up to Fatboy Slim&#x27;s mix album of the same name) containing an eclectic selection of tracks, including two short tracks recorded by the original line-up especially for the mix: &quot;You&#x27;re Never Alone With A Clone,&quot; and &quot;Bootsy Call&quot;. Another track, &quot;Many Tentacles Pimping on the Keys,&quot; was also included which was released previously as &quot;Disco Machine Gun Part 2&quot; on the &quot;Disco Machine Gun&quot; EP in September 1997.

The 2002 album &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid of Love&quot; included a number of guest vocalists, including funk luminary Bootsy Collins.

2007 saw the release on Skint Records of the double CD &quot;Warming Up the Brain Farm: The Best of&quot;, a compilation featuring tracks from the first two albums along with rare and unreleased tracks.

The group&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Northern Stomp&quot; was released on 27 July 2009, on Corsair Records, preceded by the single &quot;Smash &amp; Grab World&quot; which was released worldwide in April, and was the band&#x27;s first new material for four years.

&quot;Northern Stomp&quot; was widely well received, with &quot;DJ Magazine&quot; giving 4 stars, saying &quot;This is a blown band album dripping with (northern) soul. The Lo-Fis are back and they deserve adoration all over again&quot; and the world&#x27;s best selling music monthly &quot;Q&quot; calling it &quot;a dance-tinged hybrid that becomes more fascinating with each listen&quot;.

The second single taken from the album was &quot;Your Midnight&quot; which featured remixes from Phil Ward&#x27;s alter ego Lord Warddd, and label mate IDC, and was released on 31 August 2009.

==Solo work and individual projects==
When Randall and Stone left they briefly set up as a new group called The Big Heat, while also recording a live mix for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Mary Anne Hobbs show. Randall contributed guest vocals to &quot;The Snow Falls&quot; from The Baldwin Brothers&#x27; album &quot;The Return of the Golden Rhodes&quot; credited as &#x27;The Train&#x27; and &quot;Rest Easy&quot; from Half&#x27;s debut album &quot;Here Lies&quot; credited as &#x27;Wrecked Train&#x27;.
In the gap between work on the second and third albums, the Lo Fidelity Allstars took on another set of pseudonyms to perform live as the group Technically Men. A ten-track album of the same name received a limited release.

In 2008, Ward launched a solo project as Lord Ward, releasing the singles &quot;Brooklyn Blister&quot; and &quot;Rich Boys in Strip Clubs&quot; on Corsair Records. In 2009 he added some extra d&#x27;s to become Lord Warddd, and released several remixes for artists including Matt and Kim, Cubic Zirconia and Hollywood Undead. He continues to play DJ sets around the world under both the Lo Fidelity Allstars and Lord Warddd banners.

<text>John Felix Anthony Cena ( ; born April 23, 1977) is an American actor and professional wrestler. As a wrestler, he has been signed to WWE , and is a record 16-time world champion as recognized by WWE alongside Ric Flair. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time.

Cena moved to California in 1998 to pursue a bodybuilding career and switched to professional wrestling in 1999, making his debut for Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW). In 2001, he signed with WWE (then WWF) and was assigned to its developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he won the OVW Heavyweight Championship and OVW Southern Tag Team Championship. After moving up to WWE&#x27;s main roster on SmackDown in 2002, he became a breakout success after adopting the character of a villainous trash-talking rapper. After winning his first WWE Championship in 2005, he underwent a gimmick change into a clean-cut heroic character, which he described as a &quot;goody-two shoes Superman&quot;. Cena led the company as its franchise player and public face from the mid-2000s to the late 2010s.

Cena has held the WWE Championship a record 13 times and the World Heavyweight Championship three times. He is also a five-time WWE United States Champion, a two-time WWE Tag Team Champion, a two-time World Tag Team Champion, a two-time Royal Rumble winner, and a one-time Money in the Bank winner. He has headlined multiple major WWE pay-per-views, including its flagship event WrestleMania five times (22, 23, 27, 28 and 29). His career has been met with mixed critical and audience reception, with praise for his character work and promotional skills but criticism for his perceived over-representation and on-screen dominance relative to other wrestlers.

Cena&#x27;s first starring film role was in &quot;The Marine&quot; (2006) and he gained praise for his performances in &quot;Trainwreck&quot; (2015), &quot;Ferdinand&quot; (2017), &quot;Blockers&quot; (2018), and &quot;Bumblebee&quot; (2018). He starred in &quot;F9&quot; (2021) and &quot;Fast X&quot; (2023) and portrayed Peacemaker in &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot; (2021) and the eponymous television series (2022–present). He released his only studio album, &quot;You Can&#x27;t See Me&quot;, in 2005, which peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Outside of his work in entertainment, Cena is known for his involvement in charitable causes, and has granted the most wishes for the Make-A-Wish Foundation at over 650.

== Early life ==
John Felix Anthony Cena was born in West Newbury, Massachusetts, on April 23, 1977, to Carol (née Lupien) and former Chaotic Wrestling ring announcer John Joseph Cena. His mother is of English and French-Canadian descent, while his father has Italian ancestry. He has one older brother named Dan and three younger brothers named Matt, Steve, and Sean. He was raised Catholic. His maternal grandfather was baseball player Tony Lupien, while his maternal great-grandfather was businessman Ulysses J. Lupien. He is also a cousin of computer scientist Natalie Enright Jerger. A childhood fan of wrestling, he would create championship belts out of cardboard for himself and his brothers. He was teased and beaten up while in school, prompting him to ask his parents for a weightlifting bench at the age of 12.

Cena was educated at Central Catholic High School in Lawrence, Massachusetts, before transferring to the private prep boarding school Cushing Academy in Ashburnham, Massachusetts. He then attended Springfield College in Springfield, Massachusetts, where he was an NCAA Division III All-American center and football team captain. He graduated in 1999 with a degree in exercise physiology and body movement, after which he pursued a bodybuilding career and worked as a limousine driver. He also worked in the store area of Gold&#x27;s Gym.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Ultimate Pro Wrestling (1999–2001) ===
Cena idolized Hulk Hogan growing up, moving to California in 1998 to begin training for a professional wrestling career the following year at Ultimate Pro Wrestling&#x27;s (UPW) Ultimate University, operated by Rick Bassman. He started wrestling in local flea markets, and once he was placed into an in-ring role, Cena began using a semi-robotic character known as The Prototype. Some of this period of his career was documented in the Discovery Channel program &quot;Inside Pro Wrestling School&quot;. He held the UPW Heavyweight Championship for 27 days in April 2000, and wrestled for the UPW until March 2001.

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE ===
==== Ohio Valley Wrestling (2000–2002) ====
On October 10, 2000, Cena made his unofficial debut for WWE (then WWF) on a &quot;SmackDown!&quot; taping in a dark match against Mikey Henderson, which he lost while performing as The Prototype. He received another tryout at a &quot;SmackDown!&quot; taping on January 9, 2001, defeating Aaron Aguilera before wrestling again in a dark match at a &quot;SmackDown!&quot; taping on March 13.

In 2001, Cena signed a developmental contract with the WWF and was assigned to its developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). During his time there, he continued to wrestle as The Prototype and held the OVW Heavyweight Championship for three months and the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship (with Rico Constantino) for two months. Throughout the early months of 2002, Cena found himself competing on house shows for the WWF, where he wrestled against the likes of Shelton Benjamin and Tommy Dreamer. After his main roster call-up in June 2002, he continued to appear on OVW programming until September 25, when he lost to Kenny Brolin in a Loser Leaves OVW match. He would later appear in a one-off appearance for the developmental farm in November under the ring name Mr. P in a six-man tag team match, where he teamed with Hall of Famer Big Boss Man and Charlie Haas in a winning effort against Lance Cade, Trevor Murdoch, and Sean O&#x27;Haire.

Cena&#x27;s call-up to the main roster meant that he was part of OVW&#x27;s Class of 2002 alongside Brock Lesnar, Randy Orton, and Dave Bautista, which eventually became known as the &quot;OVW 4&quot;.

==== The Doctor of Thuganomics (2002–2005) ====

Under his real name, Cena made his WWE television debut on the June 27 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; by answering an open challenge by Kurt Angle. After declaring he possessed &quot;ruthless aggression&quot;, he lost by a pinning combination, but put on a good showing. After the match, he was congratulated by Billy Kidman, Faarooq, Rikishi, and The Undertaker, becoming a fan favorite. He began feuding with Chris Jericho, whom Cena defeated on July 21 at Vengeance.

In October, Cena and Billy Kidman failed to win a tag team tournament to crown the first WWE Tag Team Champions of the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; brand in the first round. The next week on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Cena turned on and attacked Kidman, blaming him for their loss and turning heel for the first and only time in his WWE career. On the October 17 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Cena defeated Kidman, but lost in a rematch the next week. At Rebellion on October 26, Cena and Dawn Marie lost to Kidman and Torrie Wilson in a mixed tag team match. Shortly after, on a Halloween-themed episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Cena dressed as Vanilla Ice, performing a freestyle rap. The following week on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Cena received a new character: a rapper who cut promos while rhyming. He used the nickname &quot;The Doctor of Thuganomics&quot; and expanded his gimmick to include rapping before his matches, wearing hats and sports jerseys as part of his ring gear. While on a bus journey with other WWE superstars, Cena was involved in a freestyle rap session with Rikishi and Rey Mysterio, impressing Stephanie McMahon, leading to the gimmick&#x27;s adoption. As the character evolved, Cena began adopting a variant of the 1980s WWF logo—dropping the &quot;F&quot;—as his &quot;signature symbol&quot;, along with the slogan &quot; Life&quot;. Moreover, he was joined by an enforcer, Bull Buchanan, who was rechristened to B-2 (also written B² and pronounced &quot;B-Squared&quot;). Buchanan was replaced with Red Dogg until he was sent to the Raw brand in February.

Cena then sought the WWE Championship, held by Brock Lesnar. He entered a number one contender&#x27;s tournament for the title, gaining upset wins over Eddie Guerrero, The Undertaker and Chris Benoit. At Backlash on April 27, Cena failed to win the title from Lesnar. On May 18 at Judgment Day, Cena and The F.B.I. (Chuck Palumbo and Johnny Stamboli) defeated Benoit, Rhyno and Spanky. At Vengeance on July 27, Cena lost to The Undertaker. After losing to Kurt Angle at No Mercy on October 19, Cena became a fan-favorite when he joined Angle as a member of his team on November 16 at Survivor Series.
Cena participated in the Royal Rumble match at Royal Rumble on January 25, 2004, but was eliminated by Big Show. At No Way Out on February 15, Cena faced Big Show and Kurt Angle in a triple threat match for a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania XX, which Cena lost by submission to Angle. At WrestleMania on March 14, Cena defeated Big Show to win the United States Championship, his first singles championship in WWE. He retained the title against Rene Dupree on May 16 at Judgment Day, and in a fatal four-way match involving Dupree, Rob Van Dam and Booker T at The Great American Bash on June 27, until he was stripped of the title on the July 8 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; by Kurt Angle (the SmackDown! General Manager) after accidentally attacking him in his wheelchair. Cena won the title back by defeating Booker T in a best of five series that started on August 15 at SummerSlam and culminated on October 3 at No Mercy, only to drop it to the débuting Carlito Caribbean Cool the following week on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. The duo began a feud which resulted in Cena allegedly being stabbed in the kidney while at a Boston-area nightclub by Carlito&#x27;s bodyguard, Jesús; this worked &quot;injury&quot; was used to keep Cena out of action for a month while he was filming &quot;The Marine&quot;. After returning on November 14 at Survivor Series, Cena won the United States Championship back from Carlito on the November 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. He retained the title against Jesús at Armageddon on December 12 in a street fight.

==== WWE Champion (2005–2007) ====
On January 30, 2005, Cena took part in the Royal Rumble match, making it to the final two. He and Batista went over the top rope at the same time, at first ending the match but the match was restarted and won by Batista. At No Way Out on February 20, Cena defeated Kurt Angle to earn a spot in the SmackDown! brand&#x27;s WrestleMania 21 main event match, beginning a feud with then WWE Champion John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) and his Cabinet in the process. In the early stages of the feud, Cena lost the United States Championship to Cabinet member Orlando Jordan. At WrestleMania 21 on April 3, Cena defeated JBL to win the WWE Championship, his first world championship. Now with a spinner WWE Championship belt, JBL took the original title belt and claimed he was still the WWE Champion, until Cena defeated him in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match at Judgment Day on May 22 to retain the title.

Cena was drafted to the Raw brand on the June 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, becoming the first wrestler selected in the annual draft lottery. Cena immediately entered into a feud with Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff, after refusing to participate in the &quot;war&quot; against the Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) roster at the 2005 ECW One Night Stand. At Vengeance on June 26, Cena retained the title against Christian and Chris Jericho in a triple threat match. With Bischoff vowing to make Cena&#x27;s stint on &quot;Raw&quot; difficult, he hand-picked Jericho to take Cena&#x27;s championship from him. During their feud, even though Cena was portrayed as the &quot;face&quot; (hero) and Jericho as the &quot;heel&quot; (villain), a vocal section of the live crowds, nonetheless, were cheering Jericho and booing Cena during their matches, including on August 21 at SummerSlam, when Cena defeated Jericho to retain the title. Crowds booed Cena again during his next feud with Kurt Angle, who took over as Bischoff&#x27;s hand-picked #1 contender after Cena defeated Jericho in a You&#x27;re Fired match on the August 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Cena held on to the WWE Championship through his feud with Angle, losing to him by disqualification on September 18 at Unforgiven, pinning Shawn Michaels in a triple threat match involving Angle at Taboo Tuesday on November 1, and pinning Angle on November 27 at Survivor Series. The feud with Angle saw Cena add a secondary, submission based, finishing maneuver—the &quot;STFU&quot; (a stepover toehold sleeper, though named for a stepover toehold facelock)—when he was put into a triple threat submissions only match on the November 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.
At New Year&#x27;s Revolution on January 8, 2006, Cena retained the WWE Championship in the Elimination Chamber match after last eliminating Carlito, but immediately afterwards, Mr. McMahon announced Edge was cashing in his Money in the Bank contract—a &quot;guaranteed title match against the WWE Champion at a time and place of the owner&#x27;s choosing&quot;. Two quick spears allowed Edge to pin Cena and win the championship. Cena won the title back on January 29 at Royal Rumble. After that, Cena began feuding with Triple H. The crowd, which had mostly cheered Cena over the previous few months, started booing him again and cheering the villain Triple H. Cena beat Triple H at WrestleMania 22 on April 2 to retain the title. The negative reaction towards him intensified when he faced Rob Van Dam at ECW One Night Stand on June 11 which took place in front of a boisterous crowd of mostly original ECW fans at the Hammerstein Ballroom. Cena was met with raucous jeering and chants of &quot;Fuck you, Cena&quot;, &quot;You can&#x27;t wrestle&quot;, and &quot;Same old shit&quot;. When he began performing different moves as the match progressed, the fans started chanting &quot;You still suck&quot;. Cena lost the WWE Championship to Van Dam after interference from Edge.
On the July 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge won the championship from Van Dam in a triple threat match that also involved Cena, re-igniting their feud. After Edge went about retaining the title by dubious means—getting himself disqualified (for which championships do not change hands)—and using brass knuckles on August 20 at SummerSlam he introduced his own version of Cena&#x27;s &quot;custom&quot; title belt, this one with his logo placed on the spinner. Cena eventually regained the championship in a match and an arena of Edge&#x27;s choice: a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match on September 17 at Unforgiven at the Air Canada Centre in Edge&#x27;s hometown of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, after performing the &quot;FU&quot; on Edge through two tables off a ladder; the match had a stipulation that had Cena lost, he would have joined the SmackDown! brand. Cena returned with his version of the spinner title belt on the next night&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot;.

On the heels of his feud with Edge, Cena was placed in an inter-brand angle to determine the &quot;Champion of Champions&quot;—or which was the most dominant champion in WWE&#x27;s three brands. Cena, World Heavyweight Champion King Booker, and ECW World Champion Big Show were booked in a triple threat match at Cyber Sunday, with the viewers voting on which of the three championships would be placed on the line. At the same time, Cena was involved in a storyline with non-wrestler Kevin Federline, who appeared on &quot;Raw&quot; with Johnny Nitro and Melina. After getting into a worked physical altercation with Federline on &quot;Raw&quot;, Federline appeared on November 5 at Cyber Sunday to hit Cena with the World Heavyweight Championship during the match, helping King Booker retain his title. On the January 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena was pinned by Federline with an assist from Umaga. At New Year&#x27;s Revolution on January 7, 2007, Cena defeated Umaga to end his undefeated streak and retain the WWE Championship. At Royal Rumble on January 28, Cena retained the title against Umaga in a Last Man Standing match.

One night after the Royal Rumble, an impromptu team of Cena and Shawn Michaels defeated Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton) for the World Tag Team Championship, making Cena a double champion. At WrestleMania 23 on April 1, Cena retained the WWE Championship against Michaels. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Michaels turned on Cena, costing them the tag titles in the second of two 10-team battle royals, by throwing Cena over the top rope and eliminating the team. The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) won the match and the titles. Cena retained the WWE Championship against Michaels, Orton, and Edge in a fatal four-way match on April 29 at Backlash. The Great Khali then declared his intentions to challenge for Cena&#x27;s championship, attacking and &quot;laying out&quot; all three of the top contenders before assaulting Cena and stealing the title belt. On May 20 at Judgment Day, Cena became the first person to defeat Khali by submission and then by pinfall on June 3 at One Night Stand in a Falls Count Anywhere match. Cena retained the WWE Championship in a five-pack challenge on June 24 at , and against Bobby Lashley on July 22 at The Great American Bash. Later that summer, Randy Orton was named the #1 contender for Cena&#x27;s championship. Leading up to SummerSlam on August 26, Orton delivered a number of sneak-attacks, performing three &quot;RKOs&quot; to Cena, who in the actual match at SummerSlam, retained the championship. A rematch took place at Unforgiven on September 16, which Orton won by disqualification after Cena ignored the referee&#x27;s instructions and continued to beat on him in the corner.

During a match with Mr. Kennedy on the October 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena suffered a legitimate torn pectoral muscle while executing a hip toss. Though finishing the match and taking part in the scripted attack by Orton after the match, surgery the following day found that his pectoralis major muscle was torn completely from the bone. At the time, it was estimated this would require six months to a year of rehabilitation. As a result, Cena was stripped of the title by Mr. McMahon on the next night&#x27;s episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, ending the longest WWE Championship reign in over 19 years. Cena&#x27;s surgery was performed by orthopedic surgeon James Andrews at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. Two weeks later in a video update on WWE.com, Dr. Andrews and Cena&#x27;s physical trainer both said that he was several weeks ahead of where he was expected to be in his rehabilitation at that time.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (2008–2010) ====
On January 27, 2008, at the Royal Rumble, Cena made a surprise return as the final participant of the Royal Rumble match, winning it and the traditional WrestleMania XXIV title shot, last eliminating Triple H. Instead of waiting until WrestleMania, the shot was cashed in against WWE Champion Randy Orton at No Way Out on February 17, winning by disqualification, therefore not being awarded the title. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena was placed back into WrestleMania&#x27;s WWE Championship match on March 30, defeating Orton in a non-title match with Triple H as special guest referee, making it a triple threat match, during which he was pinned by Orton. On April 27 at Backlash, Cena failed to regain the title in a fatal four-way elimination match, in which he was eliminated by Orton. During the match, Cena eliminated JBL, renewing their feud from 2005. Cena defeated JBL on May 18 at Judgment Day and at One Night Stand on June 1 in a First Blood match. Cena failed to regain the WWE Championship from Triple H on June 29 at Night of Champions. JBL defeated Cena in a New York City Parking Lot Brawl at The Great American Bash on July 20 to end their feud.

On the August 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena won his second World Tag Team Championship with Batista, defeating Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase but failed to retain the championship the following week against the former champions. At SummerSlam on August 17, Batista defeated Cena. Cena was named one of four contenders for CM Punk&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship in the Championship Scramble match at Unforgiven on September 7, but was replaced by Rey Mysterio after suffering a legitimate herniated disc in his neck in his SummerSlam match, which required surgery. Cena underwent successful surgery to repair the injury.

Cena made his in-ring return at Survivor Series on November 23, defeating Chris Jericho for his first World Heavyweight Championship. He retained the title against Jericho at Armageddon on December 14. After defeating JBL at the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2009, Cena lost the championship at No Way Out on February 15 to Edge, who attacked Kofi Kingston and took his place in the Elimination Chamber match. Cena won his rematch for the title at WrestleMania 25 on April 5 in a triple threat match involving Big Show. He lost the championship back to Edge in a Last Man Standing match at Backlash on April 26 after interference from Big Show, who chokeslammed Cena through a spotlight. Cena defeated Big Show at Judgment Day on May 17 and Extreme Rules on June 7 in a submission match by applying the &quot;STF&quot;. During Cena&#x27;s feud with Big Show, The Miz challenged him to a match on the April 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, but as Cena was out due to injury, The Miz claimed an unofficial win via forfeit and continued to do this over the following weeks, until Cena defeated The Miz at The Bash on June 28.
At Night of Champions on July 26, Cena challenged for the WWE Championship in a triple threat match against Triple H and defending champion Randy Orton (a rematch from WrestleMania XXIV), but was pinned by Orton after interference from Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena won a beat the clock challenge to earn another shot at the WWE Championship at SummerSlam on August 23, where Orton used underhanded tactics to retain. At Breaking Point on September 13, Cena defeated Orton in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match to win his fourth WWE Championship. He lost the title back to Orton in a Hell in a Cell match on October 4 at Hell in a Cell, but regained it at Bragging Rights on October 25 in a sixty-minute Anything Goes Iron Man match. Cena retained the title against both Triple H and Shawn Michaels in a triple threat match at Survivor Series on November 22 but lost it to Sheamus on December 13 at in a tables match. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena competed in a tournament to crown the 2009 Superstar of the Year, defeating CM Punk in the first round and Orton in the finals later that night to win the honor. He would get his rematch for the title against Sheamus on the December 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where he won by disqualification, but did not win the championship.

At Royal Rumble on January 31, 2010, Cena competed in the titular match, making it to the final two where he was eliminated by the returning Edge. Cena regained the title at Elimination Chamber on February 21 in the eponymous match, but his reign was cut short after Mr. McMahon made him defend the title immediately against Batista, who emerged victorious. Cena defeated Batista at WrestleMania XXVI on March 28 for the title, and successfully defended it in a rematch at Extreme Rules on April 25 in a Last Man Standing match. Cena defeated Batista for a third time in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match at Over the Limit on May 23, ending their feud.

==== Feuds with The Nexus, The Rock, and CM Punk (2010–2013) ====
On the June 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, during a match against CM Punk, Cena was attacked by all eight former contestants of the first season of &quot;NXT&quot;, with Wade Barrett as their leader. This group later referred to itself as The Nexus. The stable&#x27;s interferences made him lose the WWE Championship at Fatal 4-Way on June 20 to Sheamus and a steel cage match against Sheamus on July 18 at Money in the Bank. In response to The Nexus, Cena formed an alliance with Edge, Chris Jericho, John Morrison, R-Truth, The Great Khali and Bret Hart, defeating The Nexus at SummerSlam on August 15 with help from the returning Daniel Bryan, a former member of The Nexus, who replaced Khali.

Cena faced Barrett at Hell in a Cell on October 3 with the stipulations that if he were to lose, he would join The Nexus, and if he were to win, The Nexus would disband. After Barrett defeated Cena, he reluctantly joined The Nexus. Cena and fellow Nexus member David Otunga defeated Cody Rhodes and Drew McIntyre to win the WWE Tag Team Championship on October 24 at Bragging Rights. Later that night, he was forced to help Barrett defeat Orton in a WWE Championship match, giving Barrett the disqualification win, but not the title. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena and Otunga lost the titles to fellow Nexus members Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel, when Barrett ordered Otunga to lie down and lose the titles. At Survivor Series on November 21, Cena officiated a match for the WWE Championship between Barrett and Orton. Per stipulation, if Barrett didn&#x27;t win the championship, Cena would be &quot;fired&quot; from the WWE; Orton defeated Barrett to retain the title, and Cena was fired (kayfabe).

The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena gave a farewell speech before costing Barrett the WWE Championship by interfering in his rematch with Orton. A week later, Cena invaded &quot;Raw&quot;, first as a spectator, but then attacked members of The Nexus, explaining he would still take down The Nexus one by one despite not being employed. On the December 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena was rehired by Barrett in exchange that he would face him on December 19 at in a chairs match, which Cena won.
On the January 17, 2011, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena returned and faced CM Punk (who had assumed leadership of The Nexus and subsequently renamed the stable as The New Nexus) in a match which ended in a no contest after Cena was attacked by the debuting Mason Ryan, who later joined The New Nexus. Cena competed in the Royal Rumble match on January 30, which saw Cena eliminate most of the members of The New Nexus, ending his feud with the stable. He made it to the final five before being eliminated by WWE Champion The Miz, who was not part of the match. Cena won the titular match at Elimination Chamber on February 20 to face The Miz at WrestleMania XXVII for the WWE Championship.
On the February 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena replied in rap form to comments made by The Rock the previous week, as he returned as the announced guest host of WrestleMania. That night, Cena was placed into a WWE Tag Team Championship match, teaming with The Miz to defeat Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater to become the new WWE Tag Team Champions. However, their rematch clause was immediately invoked, and Gabriel and Slater won the titles back after The Miz attacked Cena, making their reign the shortest in the title&#x27;s history. After weeks of insults, Cena and The Rock finally met on the March 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where, after a verbal confrontation, and a brief attack by The Miz and Alex Riley, Cena attacked The Rock with the &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot;. At WrestleMania on April 3, Cena and The Miz fought to a double countout, but The Rock restarted the match and performed a &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; on Cena, allowing The Miz to retain the title. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena, in response to The Rock &quot;screwing&quot; him out of the title, agreed to face him in the main event of WrestleMania XXVIII, the first WrestleMania match to be set up one year in advance. At Extreme Rules on May 1, Cena defeated The Miz and John Morrison in a triple threat steel cage match to become WWE Champion. Cena then successfully defended the title against The Miz on May 22 at Over the Limit in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match, and R-Truth on June 19 at Capitol Punishment.

Cena began a feud with CM Punk, who was leaving the company due to his contract expiring after Money in the Bank. Punk defeated Cena to win the WWE Championship on July 17 at Money in the Bank and left the company with the title. Dave Meltzer of the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; awarded the match five stars, Cena&#x27;s first and only five star match. On the July 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after Rey Mysterio won the WWE Championship in a tournament, Cena challenged and defeated Mysterio later that night to become WWE Champion for a record-breaking 11th time, only to be interrupted by Punk, who also claimed to be champion. Punk again defeated Cena at SummerSlam on August 14 in a championship unification match, after special guest referee Triple H missed Cena&#x27;s foot on the rope. After Alberto Del Rio became WWE Champion by cashing in his Money in the Bank briefcase to defeat Punk, Cena became the #1 contender and beat Del Rio at Night of Champions on September 18 for his tenth WWE Championship. He lost it back to Del Rio at Hell in a Cell on October 2 in a triple threat Hell in a Cell match also involving Punk. Cena lost his rematch to Del Rio at Vengeance on October 23 in a Last Man Standing match due to interference by The Awesome Truth (The Miz and R-Truth). After weeks of The Miz and R-Truth attacking Cena and employees, Cena was allowed to choose his partner to challenge The Miz and R-Truth at Survivor Series on November 20; Cena chose The Rock as his partner, and they defeated The Miz and R-Truth, though The Rock gave Cena a &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; in the ending.
Cena then began a feud with Kane, who cited his disgust for Cena&#x27;s &quot;Rise Above Hate&quot; slogan and claimed that Cena would need to embrace the hate to defeat The Rock at WrestleMania. Cena fought Kane to a double countout at Royal Rumble on January 29, 2012, and then defeated him in an Ambulance match on February 19 at Elimination Chamber. At WrestleMania XXVIII on April 1, Cena faced The Rock in the main event; the match ended when Cena attempted the &quot;People&#x27;s Elbow&quot; on The Rock, and he countered with a &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; for the pinfall.

The following night on &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, Cena accepted his loss and invited The Rock to the ring so that he could congratulate him. However, his call was answered instead by the returning Brock Lesnar, who attacked Cena with an &quot;F-5&quot;. This led to Cena feuding with Raw and SmackDown General Manager John Laurinaitis, who revealed that he signed Lesnar to bring &quot;legitimacy&quot; to the WWE and for Lesnar to become its &quot;new face&quot;. At Extreme Rules on April 29, Cena defeated Lesnar in an Extreme Rules match. He lost to Laurinaitis at Over the Limit on May 20 after interference from Big Show, but at No Way Out on June 17, Laurinaitis was fired after Cena defeated Big Show in a steel cage match with both their jobs on the line. The following night on &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, Laurinatis was given one final opportunity to challenge Cena. However that night Cena defeated Laurinaitis and David Otunga in a handicap match to end his feud with Laurinaitis.

Cena won the WWE Championship Money in the Bank ladder match on July 15 at Money in the Bank, earning a contract for a shot at the WWE Championship anytime within a year. On July 23, on &quot;Raw 1000&quot;, Cena cashed in his contract on CM Punk, and won by disqualification after Big Show interfered, becoming the first person to cash in a Money in the Bank contract and not win a title. Cena&#x27;s feud with Punk continued into SummerSlam on August 19, where Punk retained the title against Cena and Big Show in a triple threat match, and at Night of Champions on September 16, where they fought to a draw. After being sidelined with a legitimate arm injury, Cena returned at Survivor Series on November 18, but was pinned by Punk in a triple threat match also involving Ryback. Cena then feuded with Dolph Ziggler over an alleged relationship with AJ Lee and at on December 16, he lost to Ziggler in a ladder match for Ziggler&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank contract, after AJ turned on Cena. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena teamed with Vickie Guerrero to face Ziggler and AJ in a mixed tag team match which ended in a disqualification after Cena was attacked by the debuting Big E Langston. Cena defeated Ziggler on the January 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, and again in a steel cage match the following week, despite interference from AJ and Langston in both matches, ending the feud.

On January 27, 2013, Cena won his second Royal Rumble match, announcing that he would pursue the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 29. Cena, along with Ryback and Sheamus, began feuding with The Shield, culminating in a six-man tag team match on February 17 at Elimination Chamber, which The Shield won.

==== World championship pursuits and reigns (2013–2015) ====
Cena returned at Hell in a Cell on October 27, defeating Alberto Del Rio to win his third World Heavyweight Championship. He retained the title against Damien Sandow on the October 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, and Alberto Del Rio in a rematch on November 24 at Survivor Series. Cena next challenged then-WWE Champion Randy Orton to unify their respective championships, with The Authority agreeing and arranging for a Tables, Ladders and Chairs title unification match at on December 15, which Cena lost. A rematch occurred at the Royal Rumble for the now unified WWE World Heavyweight Championship on January 26, 2014, where Cena lost after being distracted by The Wyatt Family. At Elimination Chamber on February 23, their interference caused Cena&#x27;s elimination in the Elimination Chamber match.

After Elimination Chamber, Bray Wyatt accepted Cena&#x27;s challenge for a WrestleMania XXX match. Wyatt wanted to prove that Cena&#x27;s heroic act was a façade characteristic of &quot;this era of lies&quot; and to turn Cena into a &quot;monster&quot;. At WrestleMania on April 6, Cena defeated Wyatt despite interference from Luke Harper and Erick Rowan. The feud continued after WrestleMania based on the story that Wyatt was capturing Cena&#x27;s fanbase, exemplified by Wyatt leading a children&#x27;s choir to the ring on the April 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where they later donned sheep masks. At Extreme Rules on May 4, Wyatt defeated Cena in a steel cage match after repeated interference from the rest of the Wyatt Family members and a demonic child. At Payback on June 1, Cena defeated Wyatt in a well received Last Man Standing match to end their feud; Cena buried Wyatt under multiple equipment cases to win the match.

On the June 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena defeated Kane in a stretcher match to qualify for the ladder match for the vacant WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Money in the Bank on June 29, where he won his 15th world championship. He retained the title at Battleground on July 20 in a fatal four-way match against Roman Reigns, Randy Orton and Kane. At SummerSlam on August 17, Cena lost the championship to Brock Lesnar in a squash match, during which Lesnar hit Cena with sixteen suplexes and two &quot;F-5s&quot;, ending his reign at 49 days. Cena invoked his title rematch clause against Lesnar for Night of Champions on September 21, nearly winning before Seth Rollins attacked him to cause a disqualification. Despite this, he became the first wrestler to defeat Lesnar in two WWE pay-per-view events. Cena then began feuding with Dean Ambrose for the right to face Rollins at Hell in a Cell on October 26, but Ambrose won the right by defeating Cena in a No Holds Barred Contract on a Pole match. Cena faced Randy Orton instead in a Hell in a Cell match to determine the #1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which Cena won.
On the October 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena rejected The Authority&#x27;s offer to join forces, resulting in a 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination tag match between Team Cena and Team Authority at Survivor Series. His team consisted of Dolph Ziggler, Big Show, Erick Rowan and Ryback. At Survivor Series on November 23, Big Show turned on Cena, causing his elimination, but Ziggler eventually won the match for Team Cena with the interfering Sting&#x27;s help. Per the match stipulation, The Authority were stripped from power and only Cena could bring them back. At on December 14, Cena defeated Rollins in a tables match to retain his WWE World Heavyweight Championship #1 contender status. It was then announced that Cena would face Lesnar for the title at the Royal Rumble. On the December 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Rollins and Big Show held guest host Edge hostage, forcing Cena to reinstate The Authority. On the January 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Authority added Rollins to the title match at Royal Rumble involving Cena and Lesnar. Ziggler, Ryback and Rowan were &quot;fired&quot; for joining Team Cena at Survivor Series. On the January 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena won a handicap match against Rollins, Big Show and Kane to retain his title shot at the Royal Rumble and win back the jobs of Ziggler, Ryback and Rowan. At the Royal Rumble on January 25, Cena was unsuccessful in capturing the title.

==== United States Champion (2015–2016) ====
Cena then began feuding with United States Champion Rusev, and at Fastlane on February 22, Cena failed to win the title from Rusev after passing out from his submission, the &quot;Accolade&quot;. Rusev had hit Cena with a low blow following a distraction by his manager Lana. Cena challenged Rusev to a rematch, which was declined, and Stephanie McMahon decreed that Cena would not compete at WrestleMania 31 unless Rusev agreed to a rematch. On the March 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena attacked Rusev, refusing to release the &quot;STF&quot; submission hold, causing Lana to grant Cena the match. Cena defeated Rusev at WrestleMania on March 29 to win his fourth United States Championship, marking Rusev&#x27;s first pinfall loss in the main roster.

Cena issued an open challenge each week on the program with his United States Championship on the line, successfully defending the title against the likes of Dean Ambrose, Stardust, Bad News Barrett, Kane, Sami Zayn, Neville, Zack Ryder and Cesaro. Cena retained his title against Rusev in a Russian Chain match on April 26 at Extreme Rules and an &quot;I Quit&quot; match on May 17 at Payback, ending their feud. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena was attacked by then-NXT Champion Kevin Owens, setting up a Champion vs. Champion match at Elimination Chamber on May 31, which Owens won. Cena defeated Owens in a rematch at Money in the Bank on June 14. On July 4 at The Beast in the East, Cena and Dolph Ziggler defeated Kane and King Barrett. After defeating Owens again at Battleground on July 19 to retain the United States Championship and end their feud, Cena resumed his feud with then WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins, with Rollins refusing Cena&#x27;s challenges for the title. On the July 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Authority forced Cena to defend the title against Rollins, which he did successfully despite suffering a legitimate broken nose during the match. Cena then faced Rollins in a &quot;Winner Takes All&quot; match at SummerSlam on August 23, for both the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and the United States Championship, which Cena lost after guest host Jon Stewart, appearing to side with Cena, attacked him with a steel chair, ending Cena&#x27;s reign at 147 days.

Cena defeated Rollins to win the title for the fifth time on September 20 at Night of Champions, a record in the WWE ownership era of the title. Cena retained his title against Rollins in a steel cage match on October 3 at WWE Live from Madison Square Garden, while also restarting his open challenges. At Hell in a Cell on October 25, Cena lost the title to the returning Alberto Del Rio in an open challenge. After a hiatus, Cena returned on the December 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating Del Rio by disqualification in a rematch for the title. On January 7, he underwent surgery on a shoulder injury, which would keep him out of action for an undisclosed length of time.

==== Feud with AJ Styles (2016–2017) ====
Cena returned at WrestleMania 32 on April 3, 2016, helping The Rock fend off The Wyatt Family. Cena then made his full return on the Memorial Day edition of &quot;Raw&quot; on May 30, four months earlier than had been expected for his type of injury. He was confronted by AJ Styles, only to be betrayed by Styles, who joined his former Club teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson in attacking Cena. On June 19 at Money in the Bank, Styles defeated Cena with interference from Gallows and Anderson. On the July 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena was again attacked by The Club, but was saved by Enzo Amore and Big Cass, setting up a six-man tag team match on July 24 at Battleground, which Cena, Amore, and Cass won after Cena pinned Styles. On the July 19 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; at the 2016 WWE draft, Cena was drafted to the SmackDown brand, while also defeating Club member Luke Gallows in a singles contest. At SummerSlam on August 21, Cena lost to Styles in a rematch. With Styles later winning the renamed WWE World Championship, Cena challenged him and Dean Ambrose in a triple threat match for the title on October 9 at No Mercy. He lost the match after being pinned by Styles, which came after Ambrose and Cena simultaneously made Styles submit, therefore restarting the match. Cena took a sabbatical from WWE to film &quot;American Grit&quot; season 2.

On January 29, 2017, Cena defeated Styles at the Royal Rumble to win the WWE Championship and tie Ric Flair for the most recognized world title reigns at 16. However, Cena would lose the championship two weeks later in an Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber on February 12 to Bray Wyatt. Two nights later on &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;, Cena lost a triple threat match against Wyatt for the championship in a match also featuring Styles. Cena then began a feud with The Miz, with The Miz accusing Cena of being a hypocrite because of his movie commitments, while Cena accused The Miz of stealing other wrestlers&#x27; moves and personalities. The Miz&#x27;s wife Maryse then slapped Cena before Cena and his girlfriend Nikki Bella sent The Miz and Maryse retreating. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then set up a mixed tag team match for WrestleMania 33 on April 2, which Cena and Bella won. Cena proposed marriage to Bella after the match and she accepted.

==== Free agent (2017–2019) ====

In July 2017, WWE dubbed Cena a &quot;free agent&quot; during the Superstar Shake-up, meaning he could work for both the Raw and SmackDown brands. Cena defeated Rusev in a flag match at Battleground on July 23, Baron Corbin at SummerSlam on August 20, and lost to Roman Reigns on September 24 at No Mercy. Cena returned to SmackDown the next month after Commissioner Shane McMahon named him the final member of Team SmackDown for the men&#x27;s 5-on-5 elimination match against Team Raw at Survivor Series; at the event on November 19, Cena was eliminated by Kurt Angle and Team SmackDown was defeated.

Cena failed to win the Royal Rumble on January 28, 2018 and the Elimination Chamber match to determine the #1 contender for the Universal Championship on February 25 at Elimination Chamber, as well as a six-pack challenge on March 11 at Fastlane for the WWE Championship. On April 8 at WrestleMania 34, Cena was quickly defeated by The Undertaker. After defeating Triple H on April 27 at the Greatest Royal Rumble, he thanked the crowd for sticking by him during a tough period, referencing his loss to Undertaker and his recent breakup with Nikki Bella. Cena competed in a tag team match with Bobby Lashley against Elias and Kevin Owens at Super Show-Down on October 6 in Melbourne, Australia, which he and Lashley won. He was also scheduled for a match at Crown Jewel in Saudi Arabia on November 2, but Cena refused to work the event following the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Cena returned to WWE television on the January 1, 2019, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, where he and Becky Lynch defeated Andrade Cien Almas and Zelina Vega in a mixed tag team match. On the January 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena lost to Finn Bálor in a fatal four-way match also involving Drew McIntyre and Baron Corbin to determine the No. 1 contender for the Universal Championship at Royal Rumble. Cena was scheduled to compete in the Royal Rumble on January 27, but was taken out due to an in-storyline ankle injury supposedly suffered during the match.

==== Part-time performer (2019–2024) ====
He appeared at WrestleMania 35 on April 7 in his &quot;Doctor of Thuganomics&quot; persona and interrupted Elias&#x27; concert, performing his finisher on Elias (calling it by its original name of the &quot;F-U&quot;) after insulting him. On the July 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; titled &quot;Raw Reunion&quot;, he engaged in a rap battle with The Usos.

Cena returned to WWE again on the February 28, 2020, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, seemingly announcing his retirement before he was confronted by &quot;The Fiend&quot; Bray Wyatt, who challenged him to a match at WrestleMania 36—a sequel to their WrestleMania XXX match in 2014—which Cena accepted. On the second night of the event on April 5, rather than a traditional wrestling match, the two squared off in a surreal cinematic-style match called a Firefly Fun House match, taking the competitors on a trip through history as moments from Cena&#x27;s and Wyatt&#x27;s history were played out, including Cena&#x27;s debut against Kurt Angle, a moment featuring his Doctor of Thuganomics character, and the pair&#x27;s match at WrestleMania XXX. Wyatt ultimately defeated Cena, and following his victory Cena&#x27;s motionless body vanished from the middle of the ring.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cena was unable to appear at WrestleMania 37, marking the first time he missed a WrestleMania in nearly 20 years, as he had wrestled or at least appeared at the event every year since his first appearance at WrestleMania XIX in 2003. At the time, Cena was in Canada filming the HBO Max series &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, and the pandemic made it logistically impossible for him to travel to Tampa, Florida, for WrestleMania 37, as upon his return to Canada, he would have had to quarantine for two weeks, which would have shut down production on the series. Cena did, however, appear in a WWE advertisement to help announce the location of WrestleMania 39. He finally made his return to WWE programming at Money in the Bank on July 18, 2021, confronting Roman Reigns after the latter retained his Universal Championship against Edge in the main event. Following this, WWE announced the Summer of Cena tour, confirming Cena had signed a 25-appearance deal. After initially being scheduled to face Finn Bálor for the title, Cena ultimately highjacked a contract signing on the July 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; so he would challenge Reigns at SummerSlam. At the event on August 21, Reigns defeated Cena after a back-and-forth contest.

On the June 6, 2022, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, it was announced that Cena would return on the June 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, which marked the 20th anniversary of his main roster in-ring debut. On that episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena returned and cut a promo recalling all his memories and thanking the fans for their support. He also made appearances backstage with The Street Profits, Ezekiel, Theory, Seth &quot;Freakin&quot; Rollins, and Omos. On the December 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Cena wrestled for the first time in over a year, where he and Kevin Owens defeated The Bloodline&#x27;s Roman Reigns and Sami Zayn. On January 27, 2023, Cena was announced as the cover star for the &quot;WWE 2K23&quot; video game, the second time for him being a cover star of a &quot;WWE 2K&quot; game after &quot;WWE 2K15&quot;. Over the next two months, Austin Theory would call out Cena multiple times and challenge him to a match at WrestleMania 39 for Theory&#x27;s United States Championship, which Cena accepted on the March 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. On the first night of WrestleMania on April 1, Cena lost to Theory. At Money in the Bank on July 1, Cena made a surprise appearance and was confronted by Grayson Waller after Cena stated that WrestleMania should come to the United Kingdom. Waller then attacked Cena, who retaliated by hitting the Attitude Adjustment on Waller.

Cena returned for a brief run on &quot;SmackDown&quot; starting on the September 1 episode, where he was interrupted by Jimmy Uso and attacked him. The next night, Cena served as the host of Payback, and was also a special guest referee for the match between LA Knight and The Miz, which Knight won and was embraced by Cena afterwards. At Superstar Spectacle on September 8, Cena and Seth &quot;Freakin&quot; Rollins defeated Imperium (Giovanni Vinci and Ludwig Kaiser). On the September 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Cena was attacked on Waller&#x27;s talkshow &quot;The Grayson Waller Effect&quot; by Jimmy and his Bloodline partner Solo Sikoa, before AJ Styles saved Cena. The following week, Cena and Styles were to sign a contract for a tag team match against them at Fastlane, but Styles was left unable to compete after a backstage assault from the Bloodline. Cena was set to face Jimmy and Solo in a handicap match at the event until the September 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, when LA Knight signed a contract to join Cena in the match. At Fastlane on October 8, Cena and Knight defeated Uso and Sikoa. On the October 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Cena teased retirement after mentioning he hadn&#x27;t won a singles match since 2018, before calling out anyone to face him. Sikoa came out and brawled with Cena, setting up a match between the two at Crown Jewel. At the event on November 4, Cena was defeated by Sikoa after nine Samoan Spikes.

On April 7, 2024, during the Night 2 main event of WrestleMania XL between Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes, Cena appeared to aide Cody Rhodes and take out Solo Sikoa and Roman Reigns with Attitude Adjustments. Afterwards, The Rock appeared and performed a Rock Bottom on Cena. On &quot;Raw&quot; the next night, Cena competed in his first match on &quot;Raw&quot; since January 2019, where he teamed up with Raw Tag Team Champions The Awesome Truth (The Miz and R-Truth) to defeat Judgment Day members Finn Bálor, JD McDonagh, and Dominik Mysterio.

==== Retirement tour (2024–present) ====
Cena made a surprise appearance at Money in the Bank on July 15, 2024, to announce his future retirement from in-ring action. He declared that WrestleMania 41 would be his final WrestleMania, but he would continue to wrestle until the end of 2025. During &quot;Raw&quot;″s premiere on Netflix on January 6, 2025, Cena announced that he would compete in the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble on February 1, where he scored three eliminations and ultimately finished in second place, being the last person eliminated by winner Jey Uso. Soon afterwards, Cena announced that he would compete in the Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber: Toronto.

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==
=== In-ring style ===

Cena&#x27;s original gimmick portrayed a white rapper who wore jerseys, backwards hats, a chain with a padlock around his neck, and was known as the &quot;Doctor of Thuganomics&quot;. First as &quot;The Prototype&quot;, and later under his real name, Cena sometimes used underhanded tactics to score victories, such as using his chain as a weapon behind the referee&#x27;s back. He often rapped before his matches, insulting his opponents, events that happened in the media and even the crowd. He also regularly performed &quot;rap battles&quot;, where he and his opponent took turns rapping on each other. In 2006, shortly after his debut film, &quot;The Marine&quot;, his wrestling character shifted from that of a rapper to a young military upstart, wearing dog tags and cargo shorts to the ring and also performing a salute to the crowd. Cena said in a 2011 interview with WWE.com that &quot;every night when I do that salute, it&#x27;s also a sign of respect to the men and women that don the uniform of the Armed Forces.&quot;

During WWE&#x27;s change from TV-14 to TV-PG in mid-2008, the name of Cena&#x27;s finishing move, the &quot;FU&quot;, was changed to the &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot; and his finishing submission move, the &quot;STFU&quot;, was renamed the &quot;STF&quot; to fit with the WWE&#x27;s new policies. During his career, he has been known for ending his matches with a sequence of moves, dubbed the &quot;Five Moves of Doom&quot;. The moves typically go in the following order: two flying shoulder blocks, protobomb, &quot;Five Knuckle Shuffle&quot;, and &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot;.

Cena has portrayed a heroic character throughout his WWE career, except for a villainous run in 2002–2003. His signature ring gear includes jean shorts, sneakers, wristbands, and armbands. He also wears a variety of T-shirts and baseball caps, which commonly include one of his catchphrases: &quot;Never Give Up&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t See Me&quot;, &quot;Hustle, Loyalty, Respect&quot;, and &quot;Respect. Earn it&quot;. He has a history of returning from both real and scripted injuries much sooner than expected. ESPN reporter David Shoemaker said in April 2016, &quot;Never underestimate Cena&#x27;s recuperative abilities. He&#x27;s somewhere on the recovery scale between German platelet-rich plasma therapy and Deadpool&quot;. Fellow wrestler Big Show said he felt most stable being lifted by Cena, despite Cena being over 200 lbs lighter and almost a foot shorter—a testament to Cena&#x27;s functional strength.

=== Fashion ===

During his WWE career, Cena&#x27;s has used his attire in an attempt to reflect the most current fashions and styling within the hip hop culture that his character represents. Cena started out wearing &quot;throwback jerseys&quot; and Reebok pumps until WWE produced specific Cena merchandise which he began wearing. While Cena was a member of the &quot;SmackDown&quot; brand, one of his WWE-produced T-shirts bore the suggestive spoonerism &quot;Ruck Fules&quot;. Whenever it appeared on television, the image was censored, not by the network, but by WWE to sell more shirts under the premise that it was &quot;too hot for TV&quot;. He also wore a chain with a large padlock, occasionally using it as a weapon, until WrestleMania 21, when it was replaced with a chromed and diamond studded &quot;Chain Gang&quot; spinner medallion matching his spinner title belt.

Around the time &quot;The Marine&quot; was released, Cena began wearing more military related attire, including camouflage shorts, dog tags, a Marine soldier cap, and a WWE produced shirt with the legend &quot;Chain Gang Assault Battalion&quot;. Shortly after WrestleMania 23, when promotion for &quot;The Marine&quot; ended, the military attire diminished and was replaced with apparel bearing his new slogan &quot;American Made Muscle&quot; along with denim shorts, not seen since he was a member of the &quot;SmackDown&quot; roster. He then wore shirts that promoted Cenation and his trademark line &quot;You Can&#x27;t See Me&quot;.

=== Legacy ===
Cena has been called the greatest professional wrestler of all time by his peers Kurt Angle, John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield, and veteran industry personality Paul Heyman. When discussing Cena&#x27;s legacy on his podcast, Jim Cornette (who was head booker of OVW while Cena was there) stated &quot;I think [Cena is] the last big star in wrestling&quot;, praising his work ethic, athletic ability and microphone skills.

WWE chairman Vince McMahon said he regarded John Cena as the WWE&#x27;s Babe Ruth. &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; named Cena one of the 10 greatest WWE wrestlers of all time. In 2012, WrestleMania XXVIII, headlined by the John Cena vs. The Rock main event, became the highest drawing event in WWE history with 1,217,000 buys. The event held the record for the highest grossing live event in WWE history as of 2012, grossing $8.9 million.

== Acting career ==
=== Film ===

WWE Studios, a division of WWE which produces and finances motion pictures, produced Cena&#x27;s first movie—&quot;The Marine&quot;, which was distributed theatrically by 20th Century Fox America beginning on October 13, 2006. In its first week, the film made approximately US$7 million at the United States box office. After ten weeks in theaters, the film grossed $18.7 million. Once the film was released on DVD, it fared better, making $30 million in rentals in the first twelve weeks.
His second film, also produced by WWE Studios and distributed by 20th Century Fox was &quot;12 Rounds&quot;. Filming began on February 25, 2008, in New Orleans; the film was released on March 27, 2009.

Cena co-starred in his third film produced by WWE Studios, titled &quot;Legendary&quot;, which was played in selected theaters beginning on September 10, 2010, for a limited time. It was then released on DVD on September 28, 2010. That same year, Cena starred in the children&#x27;s film &quot;&quot;, a film based on Lucas Cruikshank&#x27;s YouTube videos of the same name, where he plays Fred&#x27;s imaginary father. The movie was first aired on Nickelodeon in September 2010.

In 2015, Cena made appearances in the comedy films &quot;Trainwreck&quot;, &quot;Sisters&quot; and a cameo in &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot;. In 2017, Cena starred in the war drama &quot;The Wall&quot; and lent his voice for the animated films &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up 2: WaveMania&quot; and &quot;Ferdinand.&quot; He also appeared in &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home 2&quot;, reprising his role in a larger capacity than the 2015 film. In 2018, Cena starred in the comedy &quot;Blockers&quot;, and had a leading role in the &quot;Transformers&quot; spin-off prequel, &quot;Bumblebee&quot;. In 2019, he starred in &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, playing the role of smokejumper superintendent Jake Carson. In 2020, he voiced Yoshi, a polar bear, in the adventure comedy film &quot;Dolittle&quot;.

In 2019, Cena was cast in Justin Lin&#x27;s &quot;F9&quot;, playing Jakob Toretto, the brother of Vin Diesel&#x27;s character Dominic Toretto. During the film&#x27;s promotional tour in 2021, Cena referred to Taiwan as &quot;a country&quot;. He subsequently posted an apology on social media as China considers Taiwan a part of China. Comedian and political commentator Bill Maher criticized Cena for his apology to China.

Cena also was cast as Christopher Smith / Peacemaker in James Gunn&#x27;s &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot;, a role originally intended for Dave Bautista. In 2023, he reprised his role as Jakob Toretto in &quot;Fast X&quot;, which premiered in theaters on May 19, 2023. He was also the voice of Rocksteady in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem&quot;, which was released on August 2, 2023.

=== Guest appearances ===
Before his WWE debut, Cena made an appearance on the webcast &quot;Go Sick&quot; as Bruebaker, an angry, cursing wrestler in 2001.

During his WWE career, Cena has appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; three times. He has also appeared on morning radio shows including the CBS and XM versions of Opie and Anthony as part of their &quot;walkover&quot; on October 10, 2006. Other appearances have included NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, Fuse&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Playlist&quot;, Fox Sports Net&#x27;s &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot;, FOX&#x27;s &quot;MADtv&quot;, &quot;G4&#x27;s Training Camp&quot; (with Shelton Benjamin), and two appearances on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; (August 2006 and May 2007), as the victim of a practical joke. He also served as a co-presenter, with Hulk Hogan, at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards, as a guest judge during the third week of the 2006 season of &quot;Nashville Star&quot;, and appeared at the 2007 Nickelodeon UK Kids Choice Awards.

In January 2007, Cena, Batista, and Ashley Massaro appeared representing WWE on an episode of &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;, giving the children of the family whose house was being renovated WWE merchandise and eight tickets to WrestleMania 23. Two months later, he and Bobby Lashley appeared on the NBC game show &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; as &quot;moral support&quot; to longtime WWE fan and front row staple, Rick &quot;Sign Guy&quot; Achberger. Edge and Randy Orton also appeared, but as antagonists. On April 9, 2008, Cena, along with fellow wrestlers Triple H and Chris Jericho, appeared on the &quot;Idol Gives Back&quot; fund-raising special. In March 2009, Cena made an appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during the show&#x27;s cold opening sequence. On March 7, 2009, he was a guest on NPR&#x27;s quiz show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; in a Not My Job sequence titled &quot;Sure, pro wrestling is a good gig, but when you win, do they throw teddy bears into the ring?&quot;.

=== Television ===
In 2001, between his training in Ultimate Pro Wrestling and Ohio Valley Wrestling, Cena was involved in the UPN produced reality show &quot;Manhunt&quot;, in which he portrayed Big Tim Kingman, leader of the group of bounty hunters who chased down the contestants who acted as fugitives. The show, however, was mired in controversy when it was alleged that the portions of the show were rigged to eliminate certain players, scenes were re-shot or staged to enhance drama and contestants read from scripts.

Cena was featured on the ABC reality series &quot;Fast Cars and Superstars: The Gillette Young Guns Celebrity Race&quot;, which aired in June 2007, making it to the final round before being eliminated on June 24, placing third in the competition overall.

In 2007, Cena was interviewed for the &quot;CNN Special Investigations Unit&quot; documentary &quot;Death Grip: Inside Pro Wrestling&quot;, which focused on steroid and drug use in professional wrestling. When asked if he had taken steroids he was heard to reply, &quot;I can&#x27;t tell you that I haven&#x27;t, but you will never prove that I have&quot;. The day after the documentary aired, WWE accused CNN of taking Cena&#x27;s comments out of context to present a biased point of view, backing up their claim by posting an unedited video of Cena answering the same question – filmed by WWE cameras from another angle – in which he is heard beginning the same statement with &quot;absolutely not&quot;. A text interview on the website with Cena later had him saying the news outlet should apologize for misrepresenting him, which CNN refused, saying they felt the true answer to the question began with the phrase &quot;my answer to that question&quot;. However, they did edit the documentary on subsequent airings to include the &quot;absolutely not&quot;.

Cena hosted the Australian Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards with Natalie Bassingthwaighte on October 11, 2008, in Melbourne. Cena guest starred as Ewan O&#x27;Hara, brother of Juliet O&#x27;Hara, in an episode of the fourth season of the comedy drama &quot;Psych&quot;. He also guest starred as himself in the seventh episode of Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Hannah Montana Forever&quot;.

On August 17, 2015, Cena guest co-hosted &quot;Today&quot; on NBC. Cena appeared on &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot; on August 21, 2015. Cena co-hosted &quot;Today&quot; again on March 28–30 and May 9, 10, 13 and 30, 2016.

Cena hosted two seasons of &quot;American Grit&quot; on Fox, a reality television series with 10 episodes. 16 men and women were split into four teams, where challenges were given. A US$1 million prize was given to the winning team. &quot;American Grit&quot; premiered on Fox on April 14, 2016, and the finale of season 1 aired on June 9. Cena hosted the ESPN ESPY Awards on July 13, 2016, in Los Angeles. On December 10, 2016, Cena was the guest host of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) on NBC.

On January 24, 2017, Nickelodeon announced that Cena would host the 2017 Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards ceremony on March 11. On January 11, 2018, it was announced that he would be hosting the awards ceremony again on March 24, 2018, becoming the third host behind Whitney Houston and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell to host the ceremony back to back years. Two days later, the game show &quot;Keep It Spotless&quot; premiered with him as an executive producer. In addition, he was cast on &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; as the voice of the villain Baron Draxum. The series premiered in July 2018. On February 14, 2019, it was announced that Cena would host a revival of &quot;Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader&quot; on the network, which premiered June 10, 2019.

In 2021, Cena co-hosted the TV game show &quot;Wipeout&quot;. In 2024, an almost completely nude Cena appeared onstage at the 96th Academy Awards to present the award for best costume design in reference to a streaker interrupting the ceremony in 1974. Cena largely received praise for his performance during the presentation.

== Music career ==
In addition to his wrestling career, Cena is a rapper. He performed his fifth WWE theme song, &quot;Basic Thuganomics&quot;, and it was featured on the WWE soundtrack album &quot;WWE Originals&quot;. He also recorded a song, &quot;Untouchables&quot;, for the company&#x27;s next soundtrack album &quot;WWE ThemeAddict: The Music, Vol. 6&quot;. He collaborated on a remix for the song &quot;H-U-S-T-L-E&quot; along with Murs, E-40, and Chingo Bling.

Cena&#x27;s debut album, &quot;You Can&#x27;t See Me&quot;, was recorded with his cousin Tha Trademarc. It features, among other songs, his entrance theme, &quot;The Time is Now&quot;, and the single &quot;Bad, Bad Man&quot;, for which a music video was made that parodied 1980s culture, including the television show &quot;The A-Team&quot;. A video was also made for the second single, &quot;Right Now&quot;, that premiered on the August 8, 2005, episode of &quot;WWE Monday Night Raw&quot;. Cena and Tha Trademarc were later featured on a track by the Perceptionists called &quot;Champion Scratch&quot;. Cena was featured on T-Boz&#x27;s postponed album, &quot;Still Cool&quot;.

In October 2014, Cena was featured on two songs with rapper Wiz Khalifa for his two singles &quot;All Day&quot; and &quot;Breaks&quot; for the soundtrack to the &quot;WWE 2K15&quot; video game.

Cena is a self-taught pianist, starting to learn the instrument in 2016. In 2022, he performed a piano rendition of Mötley Crüe&#x27;s &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; for the &quot;Peacemaker&quot; soundtrack, playing it onscreen as his Peacemaker character in a poignant scene to close the episode &quot;Murn After Reading&quot;.

=== Endorsements ===

Before his professional wrestling career, Cena appeared in an advertisement for Gold&#x27;s Gym. As a wrestler, he has endorsed the energy drink YJ Stinger, appearing in commercials beginning in October 2003, and Subway, for whom he filmed advertisements with their spokesperson Jared Fogle in November 2006 that began airing the following January. For a time in 2007, he also endorsed two &quot;signature collections&quot; of energy drinks and energy bars sold by American Body Builders. In 2008, Cena filmed a commercial as part of Gillette&#x27;s &quot;Young Guns&quot; NASCAR campaign.

In 2009, Cena expanded his relationship with Gillette by introducing a new online campaign called &quot;Be A Superstar&quot; featuring himself alongside fellow WWE wrestlers Chris Jericho and Cody Rhodes. The campaign features motivational videos. After Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson called Cena &quot;Fruity Pebbles&quot; during their feud (in reference to Cena&#x27;s colorful merchandise) Cena appeared on the box of Fruity Pebbles cereal in 2013.

He was the pace car driver for the 58th annual Daytona 500. On October 13, 2016, Cena made his debut as the voice of Ernie the Elephant in a new commercial campaign launched by Wonderful Pistachios. He was named to &quot;Adweek&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Creative 100&quot; and received praise for his performance. In 2020, Cena and Honda announced a partnership, with Cena becoming the new voice of Honda.

=== Philanthropy ===

Cena has granted over 650 wishes for children with life-threatening illnesses through the Make-A-Wish Foundation—the most in Make-A-Wish history, with his first wish dating back to 2002. The Guinness Book of World Records confirmed that not only had Cena granted this many wishes by mid-2022, but that second place was fewer than 200. In 2009, Cena received the Chris Greicius Celebrity Award.

From late 2011 until WrestleMania XXVIII, Cena wore a black &quot;Rise Above Hate&quot; T-shirt promoting WWE&#x27;s &quot;Be a Star&quot; anti-bullying campaign. In September and October 2012, Cena wore pink and black with the phrase &quot;Rise Above Cancer&quot; in partnership with Susan G. Komen for the Cure as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

In November 2016, Cena appeared in a public service announcement, &quot;We Are America&quot;, sponsored by the Ad Council as part of its &quot;Love Has No Labels&quot; campaign.

Cena made a $1 million donation to Black Lives Matter in June 2020 as part of the #MatchAMillion initiative made popular by K-pop band BTS.

== In popular culture ==

His catchphrase &quot;You Can&#x27;t See Me&quot; originates from 2005 when Cena was under production for his new theme song, during which he was dared by his little brother to do the yayo dance on TV, which consists of moving your head while looking into the palm of your hand. Cena accepted the dare, but did it in reverse by waving his hand in front of his face instead to make it look more visible to his brother. Over time, this evolved into his signature catchphrase &quot;You Can&#x27;t See Me&quot;. In mid-2015, Cena was the subject of the Internet meme &quot;Unexpected John Cena&quot;, also known as simply &quot;Unexpected Cena&quot; or &quot;IT&#x27;S JOHN CENA&quot;. He has also been the subject of many memes due to his catchphrase, &quot;You can&#x27;t see me&quot; such as being invisible in photos.

On May 10, 2021, Cena posted a video on his Weibo account, in which he sat in a car and ate ice cream while promoting the upcoming film &quot;Fast &amp; Furious 9&quot;. In the video, Cena speaks Mandarin and sings into the ice cream cone as if it were a microphone. The video was viewed by millions of users and inspired the creation of the meme &quot;Bing Chilling&quot;, a mishearing of &quot;bīngqílín&quot; (冰淇淋), which means ice cream and is said repeatedly in the video.

== Personal life ==

Cena resides in Land O&#x27; Lakes, Florida. He has often said that he does not want children because he would not want to be an absentee parent due to focusing on his career.

While promoting his 2009 film &quot;12 Rounds&quot;, Cena announced his engagement to Elizabeth Huberdeau. They were married on July 11, 2009. Cena filed for divorce on May 1, 2012, and the divorce was finalized on July 18 of that year. Later that year, he began dating fellow wrestler Nikki Bella. They became engaged on April 2, 2017, when Cena proposed to her at WrestleMania 33, but ended their relationship in April 2018; they had been planning to marry the following month, on May 5.

Cena began dating Shay Shariatzadeh in early 2019, and they were married on October 12, 2020, in a private ceremony in Tampa, Florida. The two had met during the production of Cena&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, which was filmed in Vancouver, where Shariatzadeh was working.

Cena started learning Mandarin Chinese in 2016 to help the WWE expand its reach, and he spoke in Mandarin at a press conference in China. In April 2018, he said that he had also learned to play the piano.

In December 2017, the Ford Motor Company sued Cena for breach of the contract under which he had bought his 2017 Ford GT. Ford alleged that he had sold it for a profit shortly after receiving it, instead of keeping the car for at least two years as agreed. Ford and Cena settled the dispute on June 19, 2018. While most of the settlement’s details were not disclosed, it was reported that Cena had agreed to apologize to Ford, and that Ford had agreed to donate the amount they had received in the settlement to charity.

From July to November 2018, Cena lived in Yinchuan, China, in order to work with Jackie Chan on the film &quot;Hidden Strike&quot;. While there, he also created a show on WWE&#x27;s YouTube channel in which he highlighted his trips to local markets and other stores.

<doc id="345803" wikidata="Q9061470" url="?curid=345803" title="Politicization of science">
<text>The politicization of science for political gain occurs when government, business, or advocacy groups use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific research or the way it is disseminated, reported or interpreted. The politicization of science may also negatively affect academic and scientific freedom, and as a result it is considered taboo to mix politics with science. Historically, groups have conducted various campaigns to promote their interests, many times in defiance of scientific consensus, and in an effort to manipulate public policy.

== Overview ==
Many factors can act as facets of the politicization of science. These can range, for example, from populist anti-intellectualism and perceived threats to religious belief to postmodernist subjectivism, fear for business interests, institutional academic ideological biases or potentially implicit bias amongst scientific researchers.

Politicization occurs as scientific information is presented with emphasis on the uncertainty associated with the interpretation of scientific evidence. The emphasis capitalizes on the lack of consensus, which influences the way the studies are perceived. Chris Mooney describes how this point is sometimes intentionally ignored as a part an &quot;Orwellian tactic.&quot; Organizations and politicians seek to disclaim all discussion on some issues as &#x27;the more probable conclusion is still uncertain&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;conclusions are most scientifically likely&#x27; in order to further discredit scientific studies.

Tactics such as shifting conversation, failing to acknowledge facts, and capitalizing on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence. &quot;Merchants of Doubt,&quot; ideology-based interest groups that claim expertise on scientific issues, have run successful &quot;disinformation campaigns&quot; in which they highlight the inherent uncertainty of science to cast doubt on scientific issues such as human-caused climate change, even though the scientific community has reached virtual consensus that humans play a role in climate change.

William R. Freudenburg and colleagues have written about politicization of science as a rhetorical technique and states that it is an attempt to shift the burden of proof in an argument. He offers the example of cigarette lobbyists opposing laws that would discourage smoking. The lobbyists trivialize evidence as uncertain, emphasizing lack of conclusion. Freudenberg concludes that politicians and lobby groups are too often able to make &quot;successful efforts to argue for full &#x27;scientific certainty&#x27; before a regulation can be said to be &#x27;justified&#x27; and maintain that what is needed is a balanced approach that carefully considers the risks of both Type 1 and Type 2 errors in a situation while noting that scientific conclusions are always tentative.

== Politicization by advocacy groups ==
A political tactic, sometimes used to delay the implementation of legislation to control potentially harmful activities, is the &quot;Scientific Certainty Argumentation Method&quot; (SCAM). In many cases, there is a degree of uncertainty in scientific findings and this can be exploited to delay action, perhaps for many years, by demanding more &quot;certainty&quot; before action is taken.
=== Climate change ===

Both mainstream climatologists and their critics have accused each other of politicizing the science behind climate change. There is a scientific consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused primarily by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.

In 1991, a US corporate coalition including the National Coal Association, the Western Fuels Association and Edison Electrical Institute created a public relations organization called the &quot;Information Council on the Environment&quot; (ICE). ICE launched a $500,000 advertising campaign to, in ICE&#x27;s own words, &quot;reposition global warming as theory (not fact).&quot; Critics of industry groups have charged that the claims about a global warming controversy are part of a deliberate effort to reduce the impact any international treaty, such as the Kyoto Protocol, might have on their business interests.

In 2006, &quot;Guardian&quot; columnist George Monbiot reported that according to data found in official Exxon documents, 124 organizations have taken money from ExxonMobil or worked closely with those that have, and that &quot;These organizations take a consistent line on climate change: that the science is contradictory, the scientists are split, environmentalists are charlatans, liars or lunatics, and if governments took action to prevent global warming, they would be endangering the global economy for no good reason. The findings these organisations dislike are labelled &#x27;junk science&#x27;. The findings they welcome are labelled &#x27;sound science&#x27;.&quot; The &quot;selective use of data&quot;, cherry picking, is identified as a notable form of scientific abuse by the Pacific Institute, an organization created to provide independent research and policy analysis on issues at the intersection of development, environment, and security.

=== Intelligent design ===
The intelligent design movement associated with the Discovery Institute, attempts to &quot;defeat [the] materialist world view&quot; represented by the theory of evolution in favor of &quot;a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions&quot;. The Discovery Institute portrays evolution as a &quot;theory in crisis&quot; with scientists criticizing evolution and that &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;equal time&quot; requires educating students about &quot;the controversy.&quot;

A cornerstone of modern scientific biological theory is that all forms of life on Earth are related by common descent with modification. While many valid criticisms to the theory of evolution have existed throughout time, often certain ideological proponents seek to expand the scope of these disagreements in order to draw doubt onto the entire theory. For example, in the United States, there is a legal precedent of those who sought to discredit the teaching of evolution in classrooms by emphasizing so-called flaws in the theory of evolution or disagreements within the scientific community. Others insist that teachers have absolute freedom within their classrooms and cannot be disciplined for teaching non-scientific &quot;alternatives&quot; to evolution. A number of bills require that students be taught to &quot;critically analyze&quot; evolution or to understand &quot;the controversy.&quot; But there is no significant controversy within the mainstream scientific community about the validity of the main pillars of theory of evolution at this time. The current controversy surrounding the teaching of evolution is thus not primarily a scientific one. The 2005 ruling in the Dover trial, &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;, where the claims of intelligent design proponents were considered by a United States federal court concluded that intelligent design is not science, that it &quot;cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents&quot;, and concluded that the school district&#x27;s promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

=== Tobacco and cancer ===

By the mid-1950s there was a scientific consensus that smoking promotes lung cancer, but the tobacco industry fought the findings, both in the public eye and within the scientific community. Tobacco companies funded think tanks and lobbying groups, started health reassurance campaigns, ran advertisements in medical journals, and researched alternate explanations for lung cancer, such as pollution, asbestos and even pet birds. Denying the case against tobacco was &quot;closed,&quot; they called for more research as a tactic to delay regulation. John Horgan, notes a rhetoric tactic that has been used by tobacco companies. It is summarized in a line that appeared in a confidential memo from a tobacco company, in 1969, when they sought to cast doubt on evidence that supports smoking causes cancer. It read, &quot;Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the &#x27;body of fact&#x27; that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy.&quot;

=== Eugenics ===
Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler was well known for eugenics programs which attempted to maintain a &quot;pure&quot; German race through a series of programs that ran under the banner of racial hygiene. The Nazis manipulated scientific research in Germany, by forcing some scholars to emigrate, and by allocating funding for research based on ideological rather than scientific merit.

In the early 20th century, Eugenics enjoyed substantial international support, from leading politicians and scientists. The First International Congress of Eugenics in 1912 was supported by many prominent persons, including its president Leonard Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin; honorary vice-president Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty and future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; Auguste Forel, famous Swiss pathologist; Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone; among other prominent people.

The level of support for eugenics research by the Nazis prompted an American eugenics advocate to seek an expansion of the American program, with the complaint that &quot;the Germans are beating us at our own game&quot;.

There was a strong connection between American and Nazi eugenics research. Nazis based their eugenics program on the United States&#x27; programs of forced sterilization, especially on the eugenics laws that had been enacted in California.

=== Social justice ===
Some critics argue that science has been politicized by social justice advocates. David Randall, director of research at the politically conservative advocacy group the National Association of Scholars, said that the emphasis on pursuing social justice and political activism &quot;threatens the very definition of science as primarily a search for truth&quot;. In October 2021, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported a rise in calls for &quot;citational justice&quot; within academic communities, which the article defines as an effort by professors and graduate students &quot;to cite more Black, Latino, Asian and Native American scholars and in some cases refuse to acknowledge in footnotes the research of those who hold distasteful views.&quot; Some researchers have defended these efforts against the charge of politicization, arguing that science has always been inherently political.

== Government politicization ==

=== Poland ===
Poland employs a distinctive system for conferring academic titles in which the President of the Republic of Poland officially awards the title of &quot;profesor zwyczajny&quot; (full professor) to candidates recommended by independent academic committees. Although this role is formally intended to be ceremonial and devoid of political influence, in practice it has become a locus for politicization. Under Polish law, the president’s decision is not subject to a strict statutory deadline, granting considerable discretionary power that can be—and critics argue is—exploited for political ends.

For instance, the promotion of noted genocide researcher Michał Bilewicz was reportedly delayed by President Andrzej Duda, a move that critics interpreted as punitive towards scholars whose work challenges nationalist narratives. In a related development, Prof. Bilewicz later won a court case against President Duda over the delay in his promotion. Other cases have raised similar concerns that the conferral process, rather than being a neutral recognition of scholarly merit, may serve as an indirect instrument of state influence over academia. Consequently, critics contend that such politicization undermines the autonomy of scientific inquiry and academic freedom in Poland, blurring the boundary between scholarly achievement and political favor.

=== Soviet Union ===
In the Soviet Union, scientific research was under strict political control. A number of research areas were declared &quot;bourgeois pseudoscience&quot; and forbidden. This has led to significant setbacks for the Soviet science, notably in biology due to ban on genetics (see &quot;Lysenkoism&quot;) and in computer science, which drastically influenced the Soviet economy and technology.

=== United States ===
The General Social Survey (GSS) of 1974 recorded that conservatives had the highest rates of trust in science between the three major political demographics: conservatives, liberals, and moderates. This study was repeated annually between 1972 and 1994, and biannually from 1994 until 2010. In 2010, when the same study was repeated, conservatives&#x27; trust rates had decreased from 49% to 38%, moderates&#x27; trust rates from 45% to 40%, and liberals&#x27; trust rates staying relatively stable, rising slightly from 48% to 50%.

The study by Gordon Gauchat, which investigates time trends in the public trust of science in the United States, suggests that the increase of distrust of conservatives can be attributed to two cultural shifts. The first was during the post-Reagan era when the New Right emerged, and the second during the G.W. Bush era when the NR intensified and conservatives commenced the &quot;war on science&quot;.

Barack Obama and other politicians, since Bush&#x27;s presidency, have expressed their concerns with the politicization of science in both the public and government sphere. In 2011, during his State of the Union speech, Obama discussed his dissatisfaction of the relationships between organized science, private economic interests, and the government.

A 2024 analysis found that 100 U.S. Representatives and 23 U.S. Senators—23% of the 535 members of Congress—were climate change deniers. All were Republicans.

==== George W. Bush administration ====
In 2004, The &quot;Denver Post&quot; reported that the George W. Bush administration &quot;has installed more than 100 top officials who were once lobbyists, attorneys or spokespeople for the industries they oversee.&quot; At least 20 of these former industry advocates helped their agencies write, shape or push for policy shifts that benefit their former industries. &quot;They knew which changes to make because they had pushed for them as industry advocates.&quot;

Also in 2004, the scientific advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists issued a report, &quot;Scientific Integrity in Policymaking: An Investigation into the Bush Administration&#x27;s Misuse of Science&quot; which charged the following: A growing number of scientists, policy makers, and technical specialists both inside and outside the government allege that the current Bush administration has suppressed or distorted the scientific analyses of federal agencies to bring these results in line with administration policy. In addition, these experts contend that irregularities in the appointment of scientific advisors and advisory panels are threatening to upset the legally mandated balance of these bodies. A petition, signed on February 18, 2004, by more than 9,000 scientists, including 49 Nobel laureates and 63 National Medal of Science recipients, followed the report. The petition stated: When scientific knowledge has been found to be in conflict with its political goals, the administration has often manipulated the process through which science enters into its decisions. This has been done by placing people who are professionally unqualified or who have clear conflicts of interest in official posts and on scientific advisory committees; by disbanding existing advisory committees; by censoring and suppressing reports by the government&#x27;s own scientists; and by simply not seeking independent scientific advice. Other administrations have, on occasion, engaged in such practices, but not so systematically nor on so wide a front. Furthermore, in advocating policies that are not scientifically sound, the administration has sometimes misrepresented scientific knowledge and misled the public about the implications of its policies.

The same year, Francesca Grifo, executive director of the Union of Concerned Scientists&#x27; Scientific Integrity Program, stated &quot;We have reports that stay in draft form and don&#x27;t get out to the public. We have reports that are changed. We have reports that are ignored and overwritten.&quot;

In response to criticisms, President Bush in 2006 unveiled a campaign in his State of the Union Address to promote scientific research and education to ensure American competitiveness in the world, vowing to &quot;double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years.&quot;

===== Surgeon General =====
Richard Carmona, the first surgeon general appointed by President George W. Bush, publicly accused the administration in July 2007 of political interference and muzzling him on key issues like embryonic stem cell research.

&quot;Anything that doesn&#x27;t fit into the political appointees&#x27; ideological, theological or political agenda is often ignored, marginalized or simply buried,&quot; Carmona testified.

Although he did not make personal accusations, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported on July 29 that the official who blocked at least one of Carmona&#x27;s reports was William R. Steiger.

===== Food and Drug Administration =====
In July 2006 the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) released survey results that demonstrate pervasive political influence of science at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Of the 997 FDA scientists who responded to the survey, nearly one fifth (18 percent) said that they &quot;have been asked, for non-scientific reasons, to inappropriately exclude or alter technical information or their conclusions in a FDA scientific document.&quot; This is the third survey Union of Concerned Scientists has conducted to examine inappropriate interference with science at federal agencies.

The Department of Health and Human Services also conducted a survey addressing the same topic which generated similar findings. According to &quot;USA Today&quot;, a survey of Food and Drug Administration scientists by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and the Union of Concerned Scientists found that many scientists have been pressured to approve or reject new drugs despite their scientific findings concerns. In July 2006, the Union of Concerned Scientists released survey results that they said &quot;demonstrate pervasive political influence of science&quot; at the Food and Drug Administration.

===== United States Department of the Interior =====
On May 1, 2007, deputy assistant secretary at the United States Department of the Interior Julie MacDonald resigned after the Interior Department Inspector General, Honorable Earl E. Devaney, reported that MacDonald broke federal rules by giving non-public, internal government documents to oil industry and property rights groups, and manipulated scientific findings to favor Bush policy goals and assist land developers. On November 29, 2007, another report by Devaney found that MacDonald could have also benefitted financially from a decision she was involved with to remove the Sacramento splittail fish from the federal endangered species list.

MacDonald&#x27;s conduct violated the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) under 5 C.F.R. § 2635.703, Use of nonpublic information, and 5 C.F.R. § 2635.101, Basic obligation of public service. MacDonald resigned a week before a House congressional oversight committee was to hold a hearing on accusations that she had &quot;violated the Endangered Species Act, censored science and mistreated staff of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.&quot;

===== Climate change =====
In December 2007, the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; reported that at least since 2003, and especially after Hurricane Katrina, the George W. Bush administration broadly attempted to control which climate scientists could speak with reporters, as well as edited scientists&#x27; congressional testimony on climate science and key legal opinions. Those who have studied organizations that set up to delay action and manufacture uncertainty about the well-established scientific consensus have divided their tactics into three steps: first, deny that there is a problem, second, make the case that there are benefits involved, and, third, insist that there is nothing that can be done.

In a study, &quot;The legitimacy of environmental scientists in the public sphere&quot; by Gordon Gauchat, Timothy O&#x27;Brien, and Oriol Mirosa, the researchers conclude that attitudes about environmental scientists as policy advisers are highly politicized. Their results demonstrate that, to be perceived by the public as a reputable policy advisor, the public&#x27;s perception of their integrity and understanding weigh more strongly than their agreement with scientific consensus.

===== Waxman report =====
In August 2003, United States, Democratic Congressman Henry A. Waxman and the staff of the Government Reform Committee released a report concluding that the administration of George W. Bush had politicized science and sex education. The report accuses the administration of modifying performance measures for abstinence-based programs to make them look more effective. The report also found that the Bush administration had appointed Dr. Joseph McIlhaney, a prominent advocate of abstinence-only program, to the Advisory Committee to the director of the Centers for Disease Control. According to the report, information about comprehensive sex education was removed from the CDC&#x27;s website.

Other issues considered for removal included agricultural pollution, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and breast cancer; the report found that a National Cancer Institute website has been changed to reflect the administration view that there may be a risk of breast cancer associated with abortions. The website was updated after protests and now holds that no such risk has been found in recent, well-designed studies.

===== Abortion–breast cancer hypothesis =====
The abortion-breast cancer hypothesis is the belief that induced abortions increase the risk of developing breast cancer. This belief is in contrast to the scientific consensus that there is no evidence suggesting that abortions can cause breast cancer. Despite the scientific community rejecting the hypothesis, many anti-abortion advocates continue to argue that a link between abortions and breast cancer exists, in an effort to influence public policy and opinion to further restrict abortions and discourage women from having abortions. While historically a controversial hypothesis, the debate now is almost entirely political rather than scientific.

The most notable example of the politicization of this topic was the modification of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) fact sheet by the George W. Bush administration from concluding no link to a more ambiguous assessment regarding the abortion-breast cancer hypothesis, despite the NCI&#x27;s scientifically based assessment to the contrary.

===== United States House Science Subcommittee on Oversight =====
In January 2007, the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology announced the formation of a new subcommittee, the Science Subcommittee on Oversight, which handles investigative and oversight activities on matters covering the committee&#x27;s entire jurisdiction. The subcommittee has authority to look into a whole range of important issues, particularly those concerning manipulation of scientific data at Federal agencies.

In an interview, subcommittee chairman Rep. Brad Miller pledged to investigate scientific integrity concerns under the Bush Administration. Miller noted that there were multiple reports in the media of the Bush Administration&#x27;s manipulation of science to advance his political agenda, corrupt advisory panels, and minimize scientific research with federal funds. Miller, as part of the House Committee of Science and Technology, collected evidence of interference with scientific integrity by Bush&#x27;s political appointees.

==== First Trump administration ====
===== Policy =====
The Trump administration marginalized the role of science in policy making, halted numerous research projects, and saw the departure of scientists who said their work was marginalized or suppressed. It was the first administration since 1941 not to name a Science Advisor to the President. In July 2018, Trump nominated meteorologist Kelvin Droegemeier for the position, and Droegemeier was confirmed by the Senate on January 2, 2019, the final day of the 115th United States Congress. He was sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence on February 11, 2019. While preparing for talks with Kim Jong-un, the White House did so without the assistance of a White House science adviser or senior counselor trained in nuclear physics. The position of chief scientist in the State Department or the Department of Agriculture was not filled. The administration nominated Sam Clovis to be chief scientist in the United States Department of Agriculture, but he had no scientific background and the White House later withdrew the nomination. The United States Department of the Interior, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration disbanded advisory committees.

===== Climate change =====

The issue of politicized science surfaced during the 2016 United States presidential campaign by then Republican candidate Donald Trump. Trump stated his intention to strip NASA&#x27;s Earth Science division of its funding, a move that &quot;would mean the elimination of NASA&#x27;s world-renowned research into temperature, ice, clouds and other climate phenomena&quot;. Subsequently, the Trump administration successfully nominated Jim Bridenstine, who had no background in science and rejected the scientific consensus on climate change, to lead NASA. Under the Trump administration, the Department of Energy prohibited the use of the term &quot;climate change&quot;. In March 2020 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that an official at the Interior Department has repeatedly inserted climate change-denying language into the agency&#x27;s scientific reports, such as those that affect water and mineral rights.

===== Health =====
During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration replaced career public affairs staff at the Department of Health and Human Services with political appointees, including Michael Caputo, who interfered with weekly Centers for Disease Control scientific reports and attempted to silence the government&#x27;s most senior infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, &quot;sowing distrust of the FDA at a time when health leaders desperately need people to accept a vaccine in order to create the immunity necessary to defeat the novel coronavirus.&quot; One day after President Donald Trump noted that he might dismiss an FDA proposal to improve standards for emergency use of a coronavirus vaccine, the Presidents of the National Academies of Sciences and Medicine issued a statement expressing alarm at political interference in science during a pandemic, &quot;particularly the overriding of evidence and advice from public health officials and derision of government scientists&quot;.

The administration reportedly sent a list to the CDC on words that the agency was prohibited from using in its official communications, including &quot;transgender&quot;, &quot;fetus&quot;, &quot;evidence-based&quot;, &quot;science-based&quot;, &quot;vulnerable&quot;, &quot;entitlement&quot;, and &quot;diversity&quot;. The Director of the CDC denied these reports.

==== Biden administration ====
As part of an effort to &quot;refresh and reinvigorate our national science and technology strategy,&quot; President-elect Joe Biden announced, before taking office, that he will elevate the role of Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to a cabinet level position.

Biden&#x27;s removal of Betsy Weatherhead from her role as director of the National Climate Assessment has been criticized as being politically motivated.

== Scholarly studies of the politics of science ==
The politicization of science is a subset of a broader topic, the politics of science, which has been studied by scholars in a variety of fields, including most notably Science and Technology Studies; history of science; political science; and the sociology of science, knowledge, and technology. Increasingly in recent decades, these fields have examined the process through which science and technology are shaped. Some of the scholarly work in this area is reviewed in &quot;The Handbook of Science &amp; Technology Studies&quot; (1995, 2008), a collection of literature reviews published by the Society for Social Studies of Science. There is an annual award for books relevant to the politics of science given by the Society for Social Studies of Science called the Rachel Carson Prize.

<text>In mathematics, a group extension is a general means of describing a group in terms of a particular normal subgroup and quotient group. If formula_1 and formula_2 are two groups, then formula_3 is an extension of formula_1 by formula_2 if there is a short exact sequence

:formula_6

If formula_3 is an extension of formula_1 by formula_2, then formula_3 is a group, formula_11 is a normal subgroup of formula_3 and the quotient group formula_13 is isomorphic to the group formula_1. Group extensions arise in the context of the extension problem, where the groups formula_1 and formula_2 are known and the properties of formula_3 are to be determined. Note that the phrasing &quot;formula_3 is an extension of formula_2 by formula_1&quot; is also used by some.

Since any finite group formula_3 possesses a maximal normal subgroup formula_2 with simple factor group formula_13, all finite groups may be constructed as a series of extensions with finite simple groups. This fact was a motivation for completing the classification of finite simple groups.

An extension is called a central extension if the subgroup formula_2 lies in the center of formula_3.

==Extensions in general==

One extension, the direct product, is immediately obvious. If one requires formula_3 and formula_1 to be abelian groups, then the set of isomorphism classes of extensions of formula_1 by a given (abelian) group formula_2 is in fact a group, which is isomorphic to 
:formula_30

cf. the Ext functor. Several other general classes of extensions are known but no theory exists that treats all the possible extensions at one time. Group extension is usually described as a hard problem; it is termed the extension problem.

To consider some examples, if , then formula_3 is an extension of both formula_32 and formula_33. More generally, if formula_3 is a semidirect product of formula_33 and formula_32, written as formula_37, then formula_3 is an extension of formula_32 by formula_33, so such products as the wreath product provide further examples of extensions.

===Extension problem===

The question of what groups formula_3 are extensions of formula_32 by formula_2 is called the extension problem, and has been studied heavily since the late nineteenth century. As to its motivation, consider that the composition series of a finite group is a finite sequence of subgroups formula_44, where each formula_45 is an extension of formula_44 by some simple group. The classification of finite simple groups gives us a complete list of finite simple groups; so the solution to the extension problem would give us enough information to construct and classify all finite groups in general.

===Classifying extensions===

Solving the extension problem amounts to classifying all extensions of &quot;H&quot; by &quot;K&quot;; or more practically, by expressing all such extensions in terms of mathematical objects that are easier to understand and compute. In general, this problem is very hard, and all the most useful results classify extensions that satisfy some additional condition.
It is important to know when two extensions are equivalent or congruent. We say that the extensions 
:formula_47 
and 
:formula_48
are equivalent (or congruent) if there exists a group isomorphism formula_49 making commutative the diagram below. In fact it is sufficient to have a group homomorphism; due to the assumed commutativity of the diagram, the map formula_50 is forced to be an isomorphism by the short five lemma.
====Warning====

It may happen that the extensions formula_51 and formula_52 are inequivalent but &quot;G&quot; and &quot;G&quot;&#x27; are isomorphic as groups. For instance, there are formula_53 inequivalent extensions of the Klein four-group by formula_54, but there are, up to group isomorphism, only four groups of order formula_53 containing a normal subgroup of order formula_56 with quotient group isomorphic to the Klein four-group.

====Trivial extensions====
A trivial extension is an extension

:formula_51

that is equivalent to the extension

:formula_58

where the left and right arrows are respectively the inclusion and the projection of each factor of formula_59.

====Classifying split extensions====

A split extension is an extension

:formula_51

with a homomorphism formula_61 such that going from &quot;H&quot; to &quot;G&quot; by &quot;s&quot; and then back to &quot;H&quot; by the quotient map of the short exact sequence induces the identity map on &quot;H&quot; i.e., formula_62. In this situation, it is usually said that &quot;s&quot; splits the above exact sequence.

Split extensions are very easy to classify, because an extension is split if and only if the group &quot;G&quot; is a semidirect product of &quot;K&quot; and &quot;H&quot;. Semidirect products themselves are easy to classify, because they are in one-to-one correspondence with homomorphisms from formula_63, where Aut(&quot;K&quot;) is the automorphism group of &quot;K&quot;. For a full discussion of why this is true, see semidirect product.

====Warning on terminology====

In general in mathematics, an extension of a structure &quot;K&quot; is usually regarded as a structure &quot;L&quot; of which &quot;K&quot; is a substructure. See for example field extension. However, in group theory the opposite terminology has crept in, partly because of the notation formula_64, which reads easily as extensions of &quot;Q&quot; by &quot;N&quot;, and the focus is on the group &quot;Q&quot;.

A paper of Ronald Brown and Timothy Porter on Otto Schreier&#x27;s theory of nonabelian extensions uses the terminology that an extension of &quot;K&quot; gives a larger structure.

==Central extension==
A central extension of a group &quot;G&quot; is a short exact sequence of groups
:formula_65
such that &quot;A&quot; is included in formula_66, the center of the group &quot;E&quot;. The set of isomorphism classes of central extensions of &quot;G&quot; by &quot;A&quot; is in one-to-one correspondence with the cohomology group formula_67.

Examples of central extensions can be constructed by taking any group &quot;G&quot; and any abelian group &quot;A&quot;, and setting &quot;E&quot; to be formula_68. This kind of split example corresponds to the element 0 in formula_67 under the above correspondence. More serious examples are found in the theory of projective representations, in cases where the projective representation cannot be lifted to an ordinary linear representation.

In the case of finite perfect groups, there is a universal perfect central extension.

Similarly, the central extension of a Lie algebra formula_70 is an exact sequence
:formula_71
such that formula_72 is in the center of formula_73.

There is a general theory of central extensions in Maltsev varieties.

===Generalization to general extensions===

There is a similar classification of all extensions of &quot;G&quot; by &quot;A&quot; in terms of homomorphisms from formula_74, a tedious but explicitly checkable existence condition involving and the cohomology group .

===Lie groups===

In Lie group theory, central extensions arise in connection with algebraic topology. Roughly speaking, central extensions of Lie groups by discrete groups are the same as covering groups. More precisely, a connected covering space of a connected Lie group is naturally a central extension of , in such a way that the projection

:formula_75

is a group homomorphism, and surjective. (The group structure on depends on the choice of an identity element mapping to the identity in .) For example, when is the universal cover of , the kernel of &quot;π&quot; is the fundamental group of , which is known to be abelian (see H-space). Conversely, given a Lie group and a discrete central subgroup , the quotient is a Lie group and is a covering space of it.

More generally, when the groups , and occurring in a central extension are Lie groups, and the maps between them are homomorphisms of Lie groups, then if the Lie algebra of is , that of is , and that of is , then is a central Lie algebra extension of by . In the terminology of theoretical physics, generators of are called central charges. These generators are in the center of ; by Noether&#x27;s theorem, generators of symmetry groups correspond to conserved quantities, referred to as charges.

The basic examples of central extensions as covering groups are:
* the spin groups, which double cover the special orthogonal groups, which (in even dimension) doubly cover the projective orthogonal group.
* the metaplectic groups, which double cover the symplectic groups.
The case of involves a fundamental group that is infinite cyclic. Here the central extension involved is well known in modular form theory, in the case of forms of weight . A projective representation that corresponds is the Weil representation, constructed from the Fourier transform, in this case on the real line. Metaplectic groups also occur in quantum mechanics.

<text>Michael Evan Mann (born 1965) is an American climatologist and geophysicist. He is the director of the Center for Science, Sustainability &amp; the Media at the University of Pennsylvania. Mann has contributed to the scientific understanding of historic climate change based on the temperature record of the past thousand years. He has pioneered techniques to find patterns in past climate change and to isolate climate signals from noisy data.

As lead author of a paper produced in 1998 with co-authors Raymond S. Bradley and Malcolm K. Hughes, Mann used advanced statistical techniques to find regional variations in a hemispherical climate reconstruction covering the past 600 years. In 1999 the same team used these techniques to produce a reconstruction over the past 1,000 years (MBH99), which was dubbed the &quot;hockey stick graph&quot; because of its shape. He was one of eight lead authors of the &quot;Observed Climate Variability and Change&quot; chapter of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Scientific Assessment Report published in 2001. A graph based on the MBH99 paper was highlighted in several parts of the report and was given wide publicity. The IPCC acknowledged that his work, along with that of the many other lead authors and review editors, contributed to the award of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, which was won jointly by the IPCC and Al Gore.

Mann was organizing committee chair for the National Academy of Sciences Frontiers of Science in 2003 and has received a number of honors and awards including selection by &quot;Scientific American&quot; as one of the fifty leading visionaries in science and technology in 2002. In 2012 he was inducted as a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union and was awarded the Hans Oeschger Medal of the European Geosciences Union. In 2013, he was elected a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society and awarded the status of distinguished professor in Penn State&#x27;s College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. In 2017, he was elected a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.

Mann is author of more than 200 peer-reviewed and edited publications. He has also published six books: &quot;Dire Predictions: Understanding Global Warming &quot; (2008), &quot;The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars&quot; (2012), together with co-author Tom Toles, &quot;The Madhouse Effect: How Climate Change Denial Is Threatening Our Planet, Destroying Our Politics, and Driving Us Crazy&quot; (2016) with Megan Herbert, &quot;The Tantrum That Saved the World&quot; (2018), &quot;The New Climate War&quot; (2021), and &quot;Our Fragile Moment&quot; (2023). In 2012, the European Geosciences Union described his publication record as &quot;outstanding for a scientist of his relatively young age&quot;. Mann is a co-founder and contributor to the climatology blog &quot;RealClimate&quot;.

==Early life, undergraduate studies==
Mann was born in 1965, and brought up in Amherst, Massachusetts, where his father was a professor of mathematics at the University of Massachusetts. He is of Jewish ancestry. At school he was interested in math, science, and computing. In August 1984 he went to the University of California, Berkeley, to major in physics with a second major in applied math. His second-year research in the theoretical behaviour of liquid crystals used the Monte Carlo method applying randomness in computer simulations. Late in 1987, he joined a research team under Didier de Fontaine which was using similar Monte Carlo methodology to investigate the superconducting properties of yttrium barium copper oxide, modelling transitions between ordered and disordered phases. He graduated with honors in 1989 with an A.B. in applied mathematics and physics.

===Doctoral and postgraduate studies===
Mann then attended Yale University, intending to obtain a PhD in physics, and received both an MS and an MPhil in physics in 1991. His interest was in theoretical condensed matter physics but he found himself being pushed towards detailed semiconductor work. He looked at course options with a wider topic area and was enthused by PhD adviser Barry Saltzman about climate modelling and research. To try this out he spent the summer of 1991 assisting a postdoctoral researcher in simulating the period of peak Cretaceous warmth when carbon dioxide levels were high, but fossils indicated most warming at the poles, with little warming in the tropics. Mann then joined the Yale Department of Geology and Geophysics, obtaining an MPhil in geology and geophysics in 1993. His research focused on natural variability and climate oscillations. He worked with the seismologist Jeffrey Park, and their joint research adapted a statistical method developed for identifying seismological oscillations to find various periodicities in the instrumental temperature record, the longest being about 60 to 80 years. The paper Mann and Park published in December 1994 came to conclusions similar to those from a study developed in parallel using different methodology and published in January of that year, which found what was later called the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation.

In 1994, Mann participated as a graduate student in the inaugural workshop of the National Center for Atmospheric Research&#x27;s Geophysical Statistics Project aimed at encouraging active collaboration between statisticians, climatologists and atmospheric scientists. Leading statisticians participated, including Grace Wahba and Arthur P. Dempster.

While still finishing his PhD research, Mann met UMass climate science professor Raymond S. Bradley and began research in collaboration with him and Park. Their research used paleoclimate proxy data from Bradley&#x27;s previous work and methods Mann had developed with Park, to find oscillations in the longer proxy records. &quot;Global Interdecadal and Century-Scale Climate Oscillations During the Past Five Centuries&quot; was published by &quot;Nature&quot; in November 1995.

Another study by Mann and Park raised a minor technical issue with a climate model about human influence on climate change: this was published in 1996. In the context of the controversy over the IPCC Second Assessment Report the paper was praised by those opposed to action on climate change, and the conservative organization Accuracy in Media claimed that it had not been publicized due to media bias. Mann defended his PhD thesis on &quot;A study of ocean-atmosphere interaction and low-frequency variability of the climate system&quot; in the spring of 1996, and was awarded the Phillip M. Orville Prize for outstanding dissertation in the earth sciences in the following year. He was granted his PhD in geology and geophysics in 1998.

===Postdoctoral research: the hockey stick graph===
From 1996 to 1998, after defending his PhD thesis at Yale, Mann carried out paleoclimatology research at the University of Massachusetts Amherst funded by a United States Department of Energy postdoctoral fellowship. He collaborated with Raymond S. Bradley and Bradley&#x27;s colleague Malcolm K. Hughes, a Professor of Dendrochronology at the University of Arizona, with the aim of developing and applying an improved statistical approach to climate proxy reconstructions. He taught a course in Data Analysis and Climate Change in 1997 and became a research assistant professor the following year.

The first truly quantitative reconstruction of Northern Hemisphere temperatures had been published in 1993 by Bradley and Phil Jones, but it and subsequent reconstructions compiled averages for decades, covering the whole hemisphere. Mann wanted temperatures of individual years showing differences between regions, to find spatial patterns showing natural oscillations and the effect of events such as volcanic eruptions. Sophisticated statistical methods had already been applied to dendroclimatology, but to get wider geographical coverage these tree ring records had to be related to sparser proxies such as ice cores, corals and lake sediments. To avoid giving too much weight to the more numerous tree data, Mann, Bradley and Hughes used the statistical procedure of principal component analysis to represent these larger datasets in terms of a small number of representative series and compare them to the sparser proxy records. The same procedure was also used to represent key information in the instrumental temperature record for comparison with the proxy series, enabling validation of the reconstruction. They chose the period 1902–1980 for calibration, leaving the previous 50 years of instrumental data for validation. This showed that the statistical reconstructions were only skillful (statistically meaningful) back to 1400.

Their study highlighted interesting findings, such as confirming anecdotal evidence that there had been a strong El Niño in 1791, and finding that in 1816 the &quot;Year Without a Summer&quot; in Eurasia and much of North America had been offset by warmer than usual temperatures in Labrador and the Middle East. It was also an advance on earlier reconstructions in that it went back further, showed individual years, and showed uncertainty with error bars. &quot;Global-scale temperature patterns and climate forcing over the past six centuries&quot; (MBH98) was published on April 23, 1998, in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;. In it, &quot;Spatially resolved global reconstructions of annual surface temperature patterns&quot; were related to &quot;changes in greenhouse-gas concentrations, solar irradiance, and volcanic aerosols&quot; leading to the conclusion that &quot;each of these factors has contributed to the climate variability of the past 400 years, with greenhouse gases emerging as the dominant forcing during the twentieth century. Northern Hemisphere mean annual temperatures for three of the past eight years are warmer than any other year since (at least) AD 1400. The last point received most media attention. Mann was surprised by the extent of coverage which may have been due to the chance release of the paper on Earth Day in an unusually warm year. In a CNN interview, John Roberts repeatedly asked him if it proved that humans were responsible for global warming, to which he would go no further than that it was &quot;highly suggestive&quot; of that inference.

In May 1998, Jones, Briffa and colleagues published a reconstruction going back a thousand years, but not specifically estimating uncertainties. As Bradley recalls, Mann&#x27;s initial reaction to the paper was &quot;Look at this. This is rubbish. You can&#x27;t do this. There isn&#x27;t enough information. There&#x27;s too much uncertainty.&quot; Bradley suggested using the MBH98 methodology to go further back. Within a few weeks, Mann responded that to his surprise, &quot;There is a certain amount of skill. We can actually say something, although there are large uncertainties.&quot; Mann carried out a series of statistical sensitivity tests on 24 long term datasets, in which he statistically &quot;censored&quot; each proxy in turn to see the effect its removal had on the result. He found that a dataset which would otherwise have been reliable diverged from 1800 until around 1900, suggesting that it had been affected for that time by the &quot;fertilisation effect&quot;. Using this dataset corrected in comparisons with other tree series, their reconstruction passed the validation tests for the extended period, but they were cautious about the increased uncertainties involved.

The Mann, Bradley and Hughes reconstruction covering 1,000 years (MBH99) was published by &quot;Geophysical Research Letters&quot; in March 1999 with the cautious title &quot;Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the past millennium: inferences, uncertainties, and limitations&quot;. Mann said that &quot;As you go back farther in time, the data becomes sketchier. One can&#x27;t quite pin things down as well, but, our results do reveal that significant changes have occurred, and temperatures in the latter 20th century have been exceptionally warm compared to the preceding 900 years. Though substantial uncertainties exist in the estimates, these are nonetheless startling revelations.&quot; When Mann gave a talk about the study to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, climatologist Jerry D. Mahlman nicknamed the graph the &quot;hockey stick&quot;.

==Career==
===University positions===
In 1999, Mann secured a position as a tenure-track assistant professor in the department of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia. He left Virginia in 2005 to become an associate professor in the department of meteorology (with joint appointments in department of geosciences and Earth and Environmental Systems Institute) at Pennsylvania State University, where he was also appointed the director of its Earth System Science Center. He was promoted to full professor in 2009 and to &quot;Distinguished Professor of Meteorology&quot; in 2013. In fall 2022 Mann was appointed presidential distinguished professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science with a secondary appointment in the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.

===IPCC Third Assessment Report===
Before the publication of MBH98, Mann had been nominated to be an author on the IPCC Third Assessment Report. Late in 1998 he heard that he had been selected as a lead author for the &quot;observations&quot; chapter of the Working Group I report. He was to work with the numerous contributing authors in preparing an assessment of the state of knowledge of the paleoclimate record, starting by soliciting input from the leading experts in that field.

Mann was one of eight lead authors of the &quot;Observed Climate Variability and Change&quot; chapter of the report, working under the two co-ordinating lead authors for the chapter. The report was published in 2001.

===Research===
Mann continued his interest in improving methodology to find patterns in high-resolution paleoclimate reconstructions: he was the lead author with Bradley and Hughes on a study of long term variability in the El Niño southern oscillations and related teleconnections, published in 2000. 
His areas of research have included climate signal detection, attribution of climate change and coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling, developing and assessing methods of statistical and time series analysis and comparing the results of modelling against data.

The original MBH98 and MBH99 papers avoided undue representation of large numbers of tree ring proxies by using a principal component analysis step to summarise these proxy networks, but from 2001 Mann stopped using this method and introduced a multivariate Climate Field Reconstruction (CFR) technique using a regularized expectation–maximization (RegEM) method which did not require this PCA step. In May 2002 Mann and Scott Rutherford published a paper on testing methods of climate reconstruction which discussed this technique. By adding artificial noise to actual temperature records or to model simulations they produced synthetic datasets which they called &quot;pseudo proxies&quot;. When the reconstruction procedure was used with these pseudoproxies, the result was then compared with the original record or simulation to see how closely it had been reconstructed.

In August 2003 Mann with Phil Jones published reconstructions using various high-resolution proxies including tree rings, ice cores and sediments. This study indicated that that Northern Hemisphere late 20th century warmth had no precedent for roughly 2,000 years, dwarfing Medieval warmth, but proxy data was still too sparse to evaluate the Southern Hemisphere.

More recently, Mann&#x27;s areas of research have included hurricanes and climate change, and climate modelling. His work using comparisons with the results of climate models indicated that cooling from large volcanoes was not fully shown by tree ring reconstructions, and suggested that in extreme cases cooling caused by eruptions could result in trees showing no growth, and hence no tree ring for that year. The result would be that tree ring reconstructions could understate climate variability, and there has been scientific debate about the methodology and validity of these findings.

A paper published in April 2014 by Mann and co-authors set out a new method of defining the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in place of a problematic method based on detrending the climate signal. They found that in recent decades the AMO had been in a cooling phase, rather than a warming phase as researchers had thought. This cooling had contributed towards the recent Global warming hiatus in surface temperatures, and would change to enhanced surface warming in the next phase of the oscillation.

In 2018, Mann explained that the west Antarctic ice sheet may lose twice as much ice by the end of the century as previously thought, which also doubles the projected rise in sea level from three feet to more than six feet.

In 2020, Mann raised the hypothesis that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), hitherto regarded as internal oscillations of the climate system, are due to climatic noise and anthropogenic sulfate aerosols.

==Controversy over hockey stick graph==
Figures based on the northern hemisphere mean temperatures graph from MBH99 were prominently featured in the IPCC Third Assessment Report of 2001, and became the focus of controversy when some individuals and groups disputed the data and methodology of this reconstruction.

The 2006 North Report published by the United States National Academy of Sciences endorsed the MBH studies with a few reservations. The principal component analysis methodology had a small tendency to bias results so was not recommended, but it had little influence on the final reconstructions, and other methods produced similar results. Mann has said his findings have been &quot;independently verified by independent teams using alternative methods and alternative data sources.&quot; More than two dozen reconstructions, using various statistical methods and combinations of proxy records, support the broad consensus shown in the original hockey stick graph, with variations in how flat the pre-20th century &quot;shaft&quot; appears.

===CRU email controversy===
In November 2009, hackers obtained a large number of emails exchanged among researchers at the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia and with other scientists, including Mann. The release of their correspondence on the Internet sparked the Climatic Research Unit email controversy, commonly known as &quot;Climategate&quot;, in which extracts from emails were publicized to raise accusations against the scientists. A series of investigations cleared the scientists of wrongdoing. Detailed analysis by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that the critics made unsupported accusations of falsification and manipulation or destruction of data and were commonly mistaken about the scientific issues.

Mann was specifically cleared by several inquiries. Pennsylvania State University (PSU) commissioned two reviews related to the emails and his research, which reported in February and July 2010. They cleared Mann of misconduct, stating there was no substance to the allegations, but criticized him for sharing unpublished manuscripts with third parties.

The EPA gave detailed consideration to petitions with allegations against Mann from lobbyists including the Southeastern Legal Foundation, Peabody Energy, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and the Ohio Coal Association: the EPA found their claims were not supported by the evidence.

At the request of Senator Jim Inhofe, who had called man-made climate change a hoax, the Inspector General of the United States Department of Commerce investigated the emails in relation to NOAA, and concluded that there was no evidence of inappropriate manipulation of data. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the National Science Foundation also carried out a detailed investigation, which it closed on August 15, 2011. It agreed with the conclusions of the university inquiries, and exonerated Mann of charges of scientific misconduct.

===Attorney General of Virginia&#x27;s investigative demand===
Based on the CRU email leak, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli initiated a Civil Investigative Demand against the University of Virginia to obtain documentation relating to Mann&#x27;s work at the university. The demand sparked widespread academic condemnation as a &quot;blatantly political&quot; attempt to intimidate and silence Mann, and was denied in August 2010 by a judge for failure to state sufficient cause. Cuccinelli tried to re-open his case by issuing a revised subpoena, and appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court. The case was defended by the university, and the court ruled that Cuccinelli did not have the authority to make these demands. The decision, seen as supporting academic freedom, was welcomed by the Union of Concerned Scientists.

In October 2010, Mann wrote an op-ed in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in which he described several past, present and projected attacks on climate science and scientists by politicians, drawing a link between them and &quot;the pseudo-science that questioned the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer, and the false claims questioning the science of acid rain and the hole in the ozone layer.&quot; Saying they were &quot;not good-faith questioning of scientific research [but] anti-science&quot;, he called for all his fellow scientists to stand against the attacks.

Mann was a supporter of Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe&#x27;s successful 2013 campaign for governor of Virginia; in that election, Cuccinelli was the Republican candidate. On the campaign trail, Mann promoted the role of scientific research and technology in job creation and highlighted the costs of the Cuccinelli&#x27;s Civil Investigative Demand case, and the threat it had presented to the scientific community.

=== Defamation lawsuits ===
; Lawsuit against Tim Ball, the Frontier Centre and interviewer
In 2011, the Frontier Centre for Public Policy think tank interviewed Tim Ball and published his allegations about Mann and the CRU email controversy. Mann promptly sued for defamation against Ball, the Frontier Centre and its interviewer. In June 2019, the Frontier Centre apologized for publishing, on its website and in letters, &quot;untrue and disparaging accusations which impugned the character of Dr. Mann&quot;. It said that Mann had &quot;graciously accepted our apology and retraction&quot;. This did not settle Mann&#x27;s claims against Ball, who remained a defendant. On March 21, 2019, Ball applied to the court to dismiss the action for delay; this request was granted at a hearing on August 22, 2019, and court costs were awarded to Ball. The actual defamation claims were not judged, but instead, the case was dismissed due to delay, for which Mann and his legal team were held responsible.

; Lawsuit against &quot;National Review&quot;, the CEI, Mark Steyn and Rand Simberg
As attacks on the work and reputation of climatologists continued, Mann discussed with colleagues the need for a strong response when they were slandered or libeled. In July 2012, Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) blogger Rand Simberg accused Mann of &quot;deception&quot; and &quot;engaging in data manipulation&quot; and alleged that the Penn State investigation that had cleared Mann was a &quot;cover-up and whitewash&quot; comparable to the recent Jerry Sandusky sex scandal, &quot;except that instead of molesting children, he has molested and tortured data&quot;. The CEI blog editor then removed the sentence as &quot;inappropriate&quot;, but a &quot;National Review&quot; blog post by Mark Steyn cited it and alleged that Mann&#x27;s hockey stick graph was &quot;fraudulent&quot;.

Mann asked CEI and &quot;National Review&quot; to remove the allegations and apologize, or he would take action. The CEI published further insults, and &quot;National Review&quot; editor Rich Lowry responded in an article headed &quot;Get Lost&quot; with a declaration that, should Mann sue, the discovery process would be used to reveal and publish Mann&#x27;s emails. Mann&#x27;s lawyer filed the defamation lawsuit with the DC Superior Court in October 2012. Defendants were the National Review, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Mark Steyn and Rand Simberg.

Before the case could go to discovery, CEI and &quot;National Review&quot; filed a court motion to dismiss it under anti-SLAPP legislation, with the claim that they had merely been using exaggerated language which was acceptable against a public figure. In July 2013, the judge ruled against this motion, and when the defendants took this to appeal a new judge also denied their motion to dismiss, in January 2014. &quot;National Review&quot; changed its lawyers, and Steyn decided to represent himself in court. Journalist Seth Shulman, at the Union of Concerned Scientists, welcomed the judge&#x27;s statement that accusations of fraud &quot;go to the heart of scientific integrity. They can be proven true or false. If false, they are defamatory. If made with actual malice, they are actionable.&quot;

The defendants again appealed the decision. In August 2014, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press with 26 other organizations filed an amicus brief in the D.C. appeals court, arguing that the comments at issue were constitutionally protected under the First Amendment as opinion. Steyn chose to be represented by attorney Daniel J. Kornstein. On December 22, 2016, the D.C. appeals court ruled that Mann&#x27;s case against Simberg and Steyn could go ahead. A &quot;reasonable jury&quot; could find against the defendants, and though the context should be considered, &quot;if the statements assert or imply false facts that defame the individual, they do not find shelter under the First Amendment simply because they are embedded in a larger policy debate&quot;. A counterclaim Steyn filed through his attorneys on March 17, 2014, was dismissed with prejudice by the D.C. court on August 29, 2019, leaving Steyn to pay litigation costs.

The defendants filed for &quot;certiorari&quot; with the U.S. Supreme Court in the hope it would hear their appeal. In November 2019, it denied the petition without comment. In a dissenting opinion, justice Samuel Alito had favored hearing the case on the basis that, even though the defendants might yet prevail in the case, or the outcome itself come before the Court for review, the expense of litigating the case this far might itself deter speakers.

On March 19, 2021, the DC Superior Court ruled that &quot;Steyn’s actual malice cannot be imputed&quot; to &quot;National Review&quot;, when the post was not reviewed by them before publication and was posted by someone who was not their employee. It therefore granted &quot;National Review&quot; summary judgment dismissing Mann&#x27;s case against the publishers. In 2025 the court ordered Michael Mann to pay National Review over half a million dollars in attorney fees and costs, stating that Mann&#x27;s lawsuit was meritless. 

The lawsuit against writers Mark Steyn and Rand Simberg, filed in 2012, went to trial on January 18, 2024. On February 8, 2024 Michael Mann was awarded punitive damages of $1000 against Simberg and $1million against Steyn. Mann commented &quot;I hope this verdict sends a message that falsely attacking climate scientists is not protected speech&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Mann&#x27;s dissertation was awarded the Phillip M. Orville Prize in 1997 as an &quot;outstanding dissertation in the earth sciences&quot; at Yale University. His co-authorship of a scientific paper published by &quot;Nature&quot; won him an award from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) in 2002, and another co-authored paper published in the same year won the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s outstanding scientific publication award. In 2002 he was named by &quot;Scientific American&quot; as one of fifty &quot;leading visionaries in science and technology”. The Association of American Geographers awarded him the John Russell Mather Paper of the Year award in 2005 for a co-authored paper published in the &quot;Journal of Climate&quot;. The American Geophysical Union awarded him its Editors&#x27; Citation for Excellence in Refereeing in 2006 to recognize his contributions in reviewing manuscripts for its &quot;Geophysical Research Letters&quot; journal.

The IPCC presented Mann, along with all other &quot;scientists that had contributed substantially to the preparation of IPCC reports&quot;, with a personalized certificate &quot;for contributing to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2007 to the IPCC&quot;, celebrating the joint award of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize to the IPCC and to Al Gore.

In 2012, he was elected a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union and awarded the Hans Oeschger Medal of the European Geosciences Union for &quot;his significant contributions to understanding decadal-centennial scale climate change over the last two millennia and for pioneering techniques to synthesize patterns and northern hemispheric time series of past climate using proxy data reconstructions.&quot;

Following election by the American Meteorological Society he became a new Fellow of the society in 2013. In January 2013 he was designated with the status of distinguished professor in Penn State&#x27;s College of Earth and Mineral Sciences.

In September 2013, Mann was named by Bloomberg Markets in its third annual list of the &quot;50 Most Influential&quot; people, included in a group of &quot;thinkers&quot; with reference to his work with other scientists on the hockey stick graph, his responses on the RealClimate blog &quot;to climate change deniers&quot;, and his book publications. Later that month, he received the National Wildlife Federation&#x27;s National Conservation Achievement Award for Science.

On April 28, 2014, the National Center for Science Education announced that its first annual Friend of the Planet award had been presented to Mann and Richard Alley. In the same year, Mann was named as a Highly Cited Researcher by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). In 2015 he was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and in 2016 he was elected Vice Chair of the Topical Group on Physics of Climate (GPC) at the American Physical Society (APS).

On June 19, 2017, Climate One at the Commonwealth Club of California said that he would be honored with the 7th annual Stephen H. Schneider Award for Outstanding Science Communication.

He received the James H. Shea Award from the National Association of Geoscience Teachers for his &quot;exceptional contribution in writing or editing Earth science materials for the general public or teachers of Earth science.&quot;

On February 8, 2018, the Center for Inquiry announced that Mann had been elected as a 2017 Fellow of its Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.

On February 14, 2018, the American Association for the Advancement of Science announced that Mann was chosen to receive the 2018 Public Engagement with Science award.

On September 4, 2018, the American Geophysical Union announced Mann as the 2018 recipient of its Climate Communication Prize.

On February 12, 2019, Mann and Warren Washington were named to receive the 2019 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement.

In April 2020, he was elected member of the National Academy of Sciences. Along with Antonella Santuccione Chadha, he also received the World Sustainability Award from the MDPI Sustainability Foundation.

In 2022, the American Physical Society recognized Mann with the Leo Szilard Lectureship Award &quot;for distinguished contributions to the public&#x27;s understanding of climate science controversies, and to how our individual and collective actions can mitigate climate change.&quot;

In 2023 the American Humanist Association gave Mann their 2023 Humanist of the Year award.

In 2024, the British Royal Society named Mann as a Foreign Member. 

==Public outreach==

Mann, along with Gavin Schmidt, Stefan Rahmstorf, and others, co-founded the RealClimate website, launched in December 2004. The website&#x27;s purpose is to provide a site for commentaries by working climate scientists, &quot;for interested public and journalists&quot;.

After repeated attacks against his and his colleagues&#x27; academic work and being &quot;hounded by elected officials, threatened with violence, and more&quot;, Mann decided to &quot;enter the fray&quot; and &quot;speak out about the very real implications of our research.&quot; Mann has engaged with the public through film, television, radio, the press, and talks. &quot;The Patriot-News&quot; reported in 2014, &quot;The professor operates active Twitter and Facebook accounts. In several weeks, he&#x27;ll take part in an &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; session on Reddit. For him, it&#x27;s about engaging with the community.&quot;

Mann serves on the advisory board of The Climate Mobilization, an American grassroots advocacy group calling for a national economic mobilization against climate change on the scale of the home front during World War II, with the goal of 100% clean energy and net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. Mann has often called for WWII-scale climate mobilization as a means of rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In June 2015, Mann criticized the G7 nations&#x27; goal of full decarbonization by 2100 as not very meaningful considering greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced dramatically within the next decade, well ahead of the G7&#x27;s timeline. &quot;In my view, the science makes clear that 2050 or 2100 is way too far down the road,&quot; he told Climate Central. We will need near-term limits if we are going to avoid dangerous warming of the planet.&quot;

Since 2013, Mann has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.

In July 2018, Mann commented on recent extreme weather events striking across Europe, from the Arctic Circle to Greece, and on the other side of the world, from North American to Japan. He said, “This is the face of climate change&quot;, “We literally would not have seen these extremes in the absence of climate change&quot;. “The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle&quot;, “We are seeing them play out in real-time and what is happening this summer is a perfect example of that&quot;. “We are seeing our predictions come true&quot;, “As a scientist that is reassuring, but as a citizen of planet Earth, it is very distressing to see that as it means we have not taken the necessary action&quot;.

==Publications==
Mann has been organizing committee chair for the National Academy of Sciences &#x27;Frontiers of Science&#x27; and has served as a committee member or advisor for other National Academy of Sciences panels. He served as editor for the &quot;Journal of Climate&quot; and has been a member of numerous international and U.S. scientific advisory panels and steering groups. By 2010 he was the lead author or co-author of over 90 scientific publications, the majority of which had appeared in leading peer-reviewed scientific journals: as of 2016, his biographical sketch stated that he was author of more than 200 peer-reviewed and edited publications. Between 1999 and 2010 he served as principal or co-principal investigator on five research projects funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and four more funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). He was also co-investigator on other projects funded by the NOAA, NSF, Department of Energy, United States Agency for International Development, and the Office of Naval Research.

<doc id="345815" wikidata="Q4861410" url="?curid=345815" title="Barnard's Inn">
<text>Barnard&#x27;s Inn is a former Inn of Chancery in Holborn, London. It is now the home of Gresham College, an institution of higher learning established in 1597 that hosts public lectures.
Over the centuries, it has served as a school for law students, a venue for qualified attorneys, and residential chambers. The Inn suffered damage during the Gordon Riots in 1780, but was compensated. It was purchased by the Mercers&#x27; Company in the late 19th century and served as the Mercers&#x27; School premises until 1959. The buildings include a hall with 18th-century chambers and reception rooms, featuring notable architectural elements like 15th-century wooden bays, 16th-century linen fold wood panelling, and the only surviving crown posts in Greater London. Since 1991, the Inn has been home to Gresham College, hosting public lectures.

==History==
Barnard&#x27;s Inn dates back at least to the mid-thirteenth century – it was recorded as part of the estate of Sir Adam de Basing (Adam de Baysing), one time Lord Mayor of London. It passed on to John Mackworth, the Dean of Lincoln, who in turn passed it on to the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln on his death in 1451. Three years later, it was established as an Inn of Chancery – these were schools for law students before they passed on to an Inn of Court. Barnard&#x27;s Inn was one of two Inns of Chancery linked to Gray&#x27;s Inn, the other being Staple Inn. Members of Gray&#x27;s Inn were appointed readers to the Barnard or Staple Inn. For example, in the meeting of the Pension of Gray&#x27;s Inn, 19 November 1617, it was stated: &quot;Mr. William Denny chosen Reader of Barnard&#x27;s Inn.&quot; Members of Barnard or Staple&#x27;s Inn had to pay four pounds for being admitted to Gray&#x27;s Inn. Hence, at the meeting of the Pension 15 May 1626 it was said that gentlemen coming from Barnard or Staple&#x27;s Inn &quot;and crave the benefit of the fine of 43 shillings and 4 pence upon their admittance shall be admitted of the third table and paye but 43 shillings and 4 pence in that respect, otherwise to paye foure poundes as others do notwithstanding they be of Barnards Inne or Staple Inne.&quot;

Barnard&#x27;s Inn was badly damaged during the Gordon Riots in 1780. An adjacent distillery, owned by a Roman Catholic, Mr Langdale (who escaped), was set alight by rioters. The Hall and other buildings were damaged and one of the officers of the Inn witnessed a &quot;sturdy fellow&quot; pumping up gin from the cellar which he proceeded to sell at a penny a mug to the thirsty onlookers of the fire. The Inn received £3,200 in compensation for the damage.

By the 17th century, qualified attorneys were allowed to practise from Inns of Chancery as well as Inns of Court. By 1830, it had effectively become a set of residential chambers. In 1888, the link to the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln was broken and soon it was purchased by the Mercers&#x27; Company, serving as premises for the Mercers&#x27; School until 1959. It has been used as a venue for lectures by Gresham College since 1991.

==Buildings==
The buildings consist of a Hall, with 18th-century chambers and reception room. The Hall has three wooden bays, and dates from the 15th Century with 16th-century linen fold wood panelling. The roof timbers include the only surviving crown posts in Greater London. Some chalk-and-tile walling in the seminar room below dates back to Roman London.

The Hall suffered from poor repair and two inadequate restorations in the 19th century. The Mercers&#x27; Company organised substantial repairs in 1932. The roof was removed, renovated and replaced and two fireplaces of Tudor design were installed. The windows were reglazed, releaded and reframed. The windows contain the armorial bearings of Principals of Barnard&#x27;s Inn:

* William Harvey (1545)
* Gilbert Hide (1558)
* Thomas Wilcox (1574)
* George Copuldike (1594)
* John Wicksteed (1594)
* Pieter van de Putte (1666)
* Silvester Petyt (1701)
* William Betts (1704)
* William Manlove (1710)
* Matthew Lancaster (1716)
* Dingley Askham (1722)
* Wiseman Claycett (1728)

The hall was renovated again in 1990, adding facilities for meetings and functions, ready to become the home of Gresham College.

==Literary reference==
The hero of Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, Pip, lodged in Barnard&#x27;s Inn with Herbert Pocket for a number of years following his arrival in London, which would have been circa 1820.

<text>Efrem Kurtz (; November 7, 1900June 27, 1995) was a Russian conductor.

==Life and career==
Kurtz was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He studied at the Saint Petersburg conservatory with Alexander Glazunov and Nikolai Tcherepnin, among others. He then pursued graduate studies at Riga University and the Stern Conservatory in Berlin. He later was a pupil of Arthur Nikisch in Leipzig.

Kurtz made his conducting debut in Berlin in 1921 while a student at the Stern Conservatory when he substituted for an ill Nikisch to accompany the dancer Isadora Duncan on tour. This led to a number of concerts with the Berlin Philharmonic. From 1924 to 1933 he conducted the Stuttgart Philharmonic, and in 1928, Kurtz was engaged by Anna Pavlova to accompany her dancing, which he did until her death in 1931. From 1933 to 1941 he was conductor of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, touring with them extensively. His work in Monte Carlo included conducting the premiere of &quot;Gaîté Parisienne&quot;.

Kurtz later moved to the United States, and became a citizen of that country in 1944. He was music director of the Kansas City Philharmonic from 1943 to 1948. He held the same post with the Houston Symphony from 1948 to 1954, when his contract was not renewed. Kurtz also conducted a number of film scores, including Jacques Ibert&#x27;s score for Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

From 1955 to 1957, Kurtz was music director of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic jointly with John Pritchard. Thereafter he took a number of guest conducting posts, including engagements with orchestras in Leningrad and Moscow in the Soviet Union, where he returned for the first time in 1966.

Kurtz was married three times. He divorced his first wife, Katherine, to marry flutist Elaine Shaffer; Shaffer had been the first-chair flute of the Houston Symphony (under Kurtz) until she resigned in 1953 to pursue a successful solo career. The two remained married until her death, of lung cancer at the age of 47, in 1973. After her death, Kurtz married Mary Lynch, who survived him. He died in London, aged 94.

==Recordings==
His recorded repertoire included works by among others Dmitri Shostakovich (early recordings, though not premieres, of several of the symphonies and the &quot;Age of Gold&quot; ballet suite), Ernest Bloch (one of whose last works, &quot;Two Last Poems (Maybe...)&quot; was dedicated to Elaine Shaffer), Heitor Villa-Lobos (his &quot;Uirapuru&quot;). Many of these recordings were made in the 1940s and 1950s with the Philharmonia in London. He recorded primarily for Columbia Records and EMI.

<text>Mackenna&#x27;s Gold is a 1969 American Western film directed by J. Lee Thompson, starring an ensemble cast featuring Gregory Peck, Omar Sharif, Telly Savalas, Ted Cassidy, Camilla Sparv and Julie Newmar in lead roles. It was photographed in Super Panavision 70 and Technicolor by Joseph MacDonald, with original music by Quincy Jones.

&quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; is based on the novel of the same name by Heck Allen using the pen name Will Henry, telling the story of how the lure of gold corrupts a diverse group of people. The novel was loosely based on the legend of the Lost Adams Diggings, crediting the Frank Dobie account of the legend (&quot;Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver&quot;) in the author&#x27;s note. The film was a box-office failure in North America, but went on to become a major success in the Soviet Union and the Indian subcontinent.

==Plot==
An old legend tells of a fortune in gold hidden in the &quot;Cañon del Oro&quot; (&quot;Canyon of Gold&quot;), later called the &quot;Lost Adams&quot;, guarded by Apache spirits. A man named Adams is said to have found it when he was young, only to have the Apaches capture and blind him. Years later, Marshal MacKenna is ambushed by Prairie Dog, an old Apache shaman, and is forced to kill him. MacKenna thereby comes into possession of a map to the treasure. He examines it before burning it.

While being tracked by the US Cavalry, Mexican outlaw John Colorado and his gang look for Prairie Dog to get the map. They take shelter in the house of an old judge in Hadleyburg, kill him, and kidnap his daughter, Inga. Colorado captures MacKenna, intending to force him to lead them to the gold. The gang includes Colorado&#x27;s right-hand man Sanchez and several Indians, among them Apache warrior Hachita and Apache woman Hesh-ke. Hesh-ke and MacKenna were once lovers, but she rejected him after he arrested her brother, who was tried and hanged.

Ben Baker, a gambler who knows Colorado, arrives with townsmen who have learned about Colorado&#x27;s plans when one of the latter&#x27;s men got drunk in town and said too much. Colorado is forced to allow them to join his party. The townsmen include the blind Adams himself. MacKenna warns them to return home, that they will get themselves killed searching for gold that does not exist, but Colorado reveals what happened to Prairie Dog, and they stay.

The cavalry, led by Sergeant Tibbs, ambushes the party at a water hole, and most of the gang is killed. The remaining gold hunters continue on their way, while MacKenna and Inga begin to fall in love. A jealous Hesh-Ke now wants MacKenna back.

When the cavalry patrol is whittled down to just Tibbs and two others, Tibbs kills them and joins the gang. After a shoot-out with the Apaches, they reach &quot;Shaking Rock&quot;, a feature on the map. According to MacKenna, they will see the canyon the next morning. Mackenna says that he wants his guns and the girl and if there is no gold he still expects that Colorado will keep his word. Colorado reveals that he is not going to waste his share of the gold in bars and clubs but shows Mackenna a copy of the magazine La Vie Parisienne and Mackenna realizes that Colorado&#x27;s ambition is to live as a millionaire in Paris. He warns Inga to be alert for any opportunity to escape. When Inga protests that she too wants some gold, he tells her there is no gold, that he has been bluffing.

The next morning, when the first sunlight shines down, the shadow of the pinnacle of &quot;Shaking Rock&quot; starts to move and eventually points to a hidden passageway. On the other side, they see below them a vein of gold in the canyon wall opposite. As everyone races to it, Hesh-ke tries to kill Inga, who fights back, making Hesh-ke fall to her death. MacKenna, suspecting that Colorado does not intend to leave anybody else alive, tries to escape with Inga up the canyon wall. Tibbs is killed by Hachita. Colorado then pulls his gun on Hachita, only to find that it is unloaded. Hachita removed the bullets, as the spirits had told him to do, but turns his back on Colorado, who kills him with a knife.

Colorado pursues MacKenna and Inga, catching up to them at an abandoned Native American dwelling up the cliff. They fight, but are interrupted when Apaches enter the canyon. Their shouts and the pounding of their horses trigger a rockfall which causes the valley floor to buckle and quake. The Apaches flee. The three survivors descend the cliff and ride away, escaping the collapse of the canyon walls, which buries the gold beyond reach.

Colorado warns MacKenna to stay away from him, but MacKenna tells him that he will be coming after him. MacKenna and Inga ride off together, unaware that the saddle bags of the horse MacKenna is riding are stuffed with gold nuggets.

==Cast==
==Original novel==
The film was based on a novel by Will Henry (pseud. of Heck Allen) which was published in 1963. The novel was based on the legend of the Lost Adams Diggings. According to the legend, a teamster named Adams and some prospectors in Arizona were approached by a Mexican Native American named Gotch Ear, who offered to show them a canyon filled with gold. However, in the novel as well as the film, the gang abducts a Marshal named MacKenna to find a way to the Canyon.

The film also adapts elements from another work, &quot;Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver&quot; (1939) by J. Frank Dobie, a collection of tales about the fabulous treasures of the Southwest, based on the legend of the &quot;Lost Adams Diggins&quot;.

===Title===
Although Allen&#x27;s novel title and hero shared the same spelling of the name &quot;Mackenna&quot;, and the film&#x27;s title according to the studio is &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot;, Peck&#x27;s character is listed in publicity materials as &quot;MacKenna&quot;.

==Development==
Film rights were purchased by Highroad Productions, the company of writer-producer Carl Foreman, who had a deal with Columbia. It was Foreman&#x27;s first Western since &quot;High Noon&quot;.

&quot;I feel we should all do a Western from time to time&quot;, said Foreman. &quot;It&#x27;s the gym, the workout for basic cinema. In a sense this one bears a relationship with &quot;High Noon&quot;; it&#x27;s roughly about the same town 10 or 15 years later and... [the lead role is] Gary Cooper&#x27;s successor. &quot;High Noon&quot; never left town. This one never comes in but the town impinges on the story.&quot;

In April 1965, it was announced that composer Dimitri Tiomkin had joined the company as producer and his first project for the company would be &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot;. Tiomkin would also do the music. &quot;It was practical appreciation of my efforts&quot;, said Tiomkin, who had known Foreman since they served together in the Signal Corps during the war.

In October 1966, Foreman announced he wanted to make the film in the US, where he had not made a movie for almost fifteen years. He originally believed that he would have to make the movie in Spain where it could be done for below the line costs of $2.2 million, while a USA shoot would cost $3.2 million. However, on further research, Foreman felt a US shoot would cost only 10% more than a foreign one. He was persuaded to make the movie in America to use the Grand Canyon. (The budget would eventually rise to $7 million.)

In January 1967, it was announced the film would be shot in Cinerama. Columbia provided the finance and J. Lee Thompson would direct. &quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted to do an American Western&quot;, said Thompson. &quot;We&#x27;re taking a big new approach to this one, striving for an over-all presentation, rightly or wrongly, that will appear new – techniques that may now be acceptable when applied to the big screen.&quot;

Thompson later called the film &quot;sheer adventure in six-track stereo sound. Absolutely without any &#x27;other dimension&#x27;.&quot;

===Casting===
The first star signed was Omar Sharif, whose casting was announced in February 1967. His fee was $400,000. Sharif said in an Italian interview that he would make this movie for his son, who was more impressed by action films but disapproved of Sharif&#x27;s string of romantic epics during this part of his career.

Thompson&#x27;s first choice for the role of MacKenna was Clint Eastwood, who was looking to make an American Western film after his success with the &quot;Dollars&quot; trilogy. He disliked the script and turned down the movie to play the lead role in &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot; (1968). Steve McQueen was also considered for the lead role.

A script was sent to Richard Burton who called it &quot;a standard western script... Christ, what a lot of rubbish one reads.&quot;

Gregory Peck&#x27;s casting was announced in March. He had worked with Thompson and Foreman on &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;. Zero Mostel was going to play a role but had to pull out due to a scheduling clash with &quot;The Producers&quot;.

Julie Newmar signed a long-term deal with Highroad Productions as part of her casting.

Raymond Massey was the last major cast member to join the film.

&quot;This is contemporary without being tricky&quot;, said Foreman.

==Shooting==
Filming started May 16, 1967 on location in Oregon.

The plan was to show it in single lens Cinerama with reserved seat roadshow engagements. Columbia eventually pulled the plug on that idea, and &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; was drastically cut down immediately prior to its release, from nearly three hours (plus an intermission) to just over two hours.

Although most of &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; was photographed on 65mm stock, a handful of scenes were filmed in 35mm anamorphic.

===Locations and props===
Zuñi Mountains were the locations of digging according to the legend, but the film was shot mainly at Glen Canyon of Utah and Canyon de Chelly of Arizona, specifically Spider Rock. Parts of the film were also shot at Kanab Canyon, Paria, Sink Valley, and the Panguitch Fish Hatchery in Utah as well as Medford, Oregon. In the climax scenes, as the sun rises, the shadow of &quot;Shaking Rock&quot; grows longer. In reality, shadows become shorter as the sun rises higher.

The &quot;Old Turkey Buzzard&quot; theme song sequence was shot at Bryce Canyon in Utah and Monument Valley, on the Arizona-Utah border. The bird is actually a King vulture rather than a turkey vulture (buzzard).

Stock footage was used for the waterfall peril in the rafting scene. It is actually High Force on the River Tees in the northeast of England.

Stills from the scene of Julie Newmar swimming naked in the film were reprinted in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

===Film School Students: George Lucas===
Foreman allowed four film school graduates – two from USC, two from UCLA – to come on location and make their own short film on or around the shooting of &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot;. The filmmakers were Chuck Braverman, who did a documentary on Foreman; George Lucas, who made the short film &quot;6-18-67&quot;; David MacDougal, who made a documentary on Thompson; and J. David Wyles, who made a film on the wranglers. Lucas&#x27; movie was originally intended to be a making-of documentary.

Lucas felt the films were a ruse by Foreman to get some &quot;cheap, behind the scenes documentary films made&quot; but did it for the chance to direct. His project was supervised by Saul Bass. He was appalled by what he felt was a waste of money on location. Foreman reportedly hated Lucas&#x27; short film but was forced to say he liked it in a PBS documentary being made about the project. The film went on to earn a number of awards.

==Musical score and soundtrack==

The original score and songs of the film were composed and conducted by Quincy Jones, and the soundtrack album was released on the RCA Victor label in 1969. The opening song, &quot;Old Turkey Buzzard&quot;, is a recurring background theme. It was sung by José Feliciano and was composed by Quincy Jones with lyrics by Freddie Douglas. &#x27;Freddie Douglas&#x27; was a pseudonym for writer/producer Carl Foreman. José Feliciano also plays guitar and adds vocals in many parts of the soundtrack and Spanish version of the theme song &quot;Viejo Butre&quot; for the Spanish-language edition of the movie.

The theme song was used on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in 2007 as a random running gag. A 13-second clip would be played after Letterman threw his blue index cards through the &quot;glass&quot; window behind his desk, and was often combined with a video clip of the turkey buzzard soaring in the sky during the movie&#x27;s opening sequence. Letterman would gradually show increased mock irritation with the clip in discussions with bandleader Paul Shaffer, while at the same time calling it &quot;exciting, moving, inspirational&quot; and &quot;stirring, haunting, beautiful&quot;. The running gag ultimately resulted in Feliciano making a guest appearance on the &quot;Late Show&quot; on October 16, 2007, singing a longer version of the song (with the buzzard video clip superimposed over him).

==Release==
The film had its world premiere in Munich, West Germany on March 18, 1969. It opened in Phoenix, Arizona on May 10, 1969.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film was not well received by critics and audiences in North America. &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; was reviewed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Vincent Canby, who considered the film an example of &quot;stunning absurdity&quot;. He noted: &quot;The structure of the movie is so loose that a narrator (Victor Jory) must be employed from time to time to explain the plot, as if it were a serial. Most surprising in a movie that obviously cost a good deal of money is the sloppy matching of exterior and studio photography with miniature work for special effects.&quot;
Gregory Peck did not like the film, saying: &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold was a terrible western. Just wretched.&quot;

===Box office===
In the United States and Canada, the film earned in theatrical rentals. This was equivalent to estimated box office gross receipts of approximately . It was a box-office failure in North America. Despite this, the film went on to become a major success in the Soviet Union and the Indian subcontinent. In France, it was the 31st top-grossing film of 1969, selling 1,288,609 tickets, which is equivalent to an estimated ().

The film was popular in the Soviet Union. &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; was first shown at the VIII Moscow International Film Festival in 1973, followed by a cinematic premiere in 1974. The film was viewed by 63 million people and stands fourth in the all-time rankings of foreign film distribution in the Soviet Union. The title song &quot;Old Turkey Buzzard&quot; was dubbed with Russian lyrics by Leonid Derbenyov, a Russian poet and lyricist widely regarded as one of the stalwarts of 20th-century Soviet and Russian pop music. It was performed by then-popular Soviet singer Valery Obodzinsky. The film&#x27;s ticket sales were equivalent to an estimated . Combined, the film grossed an estimated in North America, France and the Soviet Union.

&quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; was and remains a very successful film in India. It remained the top Hollywood grosser in India, until blockbusters like &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993) and &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997) came along. Even worldwide, hits such as &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975) and &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) would not make as much money in India as &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; did. The film went through countless re-runs until well into the 1980s and could be seen in cinema halls across India, including small venues in the medium-size towns of North and South India.

===Awards===
Quincy Jones was nominated for a Grammy Award for best original score written for a motion picture or a television special.

<text>Longwood University is a public university in Farmville, Virginia, United States. Founded in 1839 as Farmville Female Seminary and colloquially known as Longwood or Longwood College, it is the third-oldest public university in Virginia and one of the hundred oldest institutions of higher education in the United States. Previously a female seminary, normal school, and college, Longwood became coeducational in 1976 and gained university status on July 1, 2002.

Three undergraduate academic colleges—the Cook-Cole College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business and Economics, and the College of Education and Human Services—supported by the Cormier Honors College and coupled with the College of Graduate and Professional Studies serve an enrollment of 5,096.

In early April 1865, armies under the command of Generals Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant marched past the north end of campus on Lee&#x27;s retreat to Appomattox just days before the end of the American Civil War. At the south end of campus lies the former Robert Russa Moton High School, site of the historic 1951 student strike that became one of the five court cases culminating in the historic &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision. And Israel Hill, a community of free African Americans that formed around the turn of the 19th century, is two miles from campus.

==History==

===Early history (1839–1884)===

Longwood was founded in 1839 as the Farmville Female Seminary Association. Led by Solomon Lea, a Methodist minister who had taught at Randolph–Macon College, the school flourished. Lea left to become the first president of Greensboro Female Seminary (now Greensboro College) in his native North Carolina, and several presidents and name changes followed in the subsequent decades. Led by a number of Methodist ministers, the school offered English, Latin, Greek, French, and piano.

As was common among female seminaries during Reconstruction, Farmville Female College, as the institution was then known, fell into a period of deep financial difficulty. The decade following the Civil War saw many seminaries around the South shutter their doors. The college was given new life on June 5, 1875, with a new charter granted and the college renamed Farmville College. Paul Whitehead, a minister from nearby Nelson County, Virginia, who had been president of Wesleyan Female College at Murfreesboro, North Carolina, was appointed president. Under Whitehead, enrollment grew by nearly half, topping 100 students in 1876. Whitehead resigned in 1872 to return to full-time ministry.

===Normal School (1884–1949)===

Farmville College was reinvented once again on March 7, 1884, as the State Female Normal School—the brainchild of William Henry Ruffner, the first Virginia State Superintendent of Instruction. Modeled after the French École normale supérieure, which had been developed in the late 18th century as a model for teacher preparation, the State Female Normal School is one of the oldest of several normal schools in the state.

In 1902, Joseph L. Jarman was named president of the State Female Normal School, a post that lasted an astounding forty-four years. Jarman reshaped the physical campus from a single Victorian structure to a row of colonnaded Jeffersonian brick buildings that forms the core of today&#x27;s campus. The academic program was also overhauled: the two-year teacher training program that had been in place since the college&#x27;s founding was replaced with a four-year college academic program with permission to grant degrees. Jarman instituted the Honor Code, which survives to this day, and the student government. Through still several name changes—State Female Normal School (1884), State Normal School for Women (1914) and State Teachers College (1924)—Jarman shaped the institution into one of the most well-respected teacher preparatory colleges in the state.

During Jarman&#x27;s presidency, the college purchased in 1928 the nearby estate of the Longwood House, which would become the namesake of the institution in years to come.

===Longwood College (1949–2002)===

With an expanding curriculum and growing class sizes, State Teachers College was renamed a penultimate time to Longwood College, its namesake being the nearby estate purchased by the Jarman administration. Longwood—with a focus still very much on teacher preparation—expanded its academic degrees, and in 1954 was authorized to issue graduate diplomas. The campus grew quickly in the ensuing years—three dormitories were constructed perpendicular to the core four Jeffersonian buildings: Wheeler, Cox and South Cunningham dormitories all arose between 1959 and 1963.

In 1964, the issue of coeducation arose but the Board of Visitors rejected the notion. The tide swung four years later, when Longwood began to admit male summer school transfers, and then junior and senior transfers in 1971. Men were admitted as day students in 1973, by order of the Virginia Department of Education until Longwood went fully coeducational in 1976.

In 1981, Janet Greenwood became the first woman president in the modern history of Longwood. She served until 1987.

William F. Dorrill, president from 1988 to 1996, was instrumental in increasing Longwood&#x27;s international population and expanding study-abroad opportunities for students and faculty through partnerships with numerous educational institutions around the world.

A fire burned the Rotunda building on April 24, 2001. The building was undergoing extensive renovations at the time, and no one was injured in the blaze, though the rotunda and much of Grainger Hall required rebuilding.

===Longwood University (2002–present)===

Virginia Governor Mark Warner signed legislation designating Longwood a university on April 2, 2002, one year to the day after The Great Fire that burned the Rotunda and significantly damaged Grainger Hall. Then-president Patricia P. Cormier said at the time that a &quot;university is a better reflection of the type of institution that Longwood is today. We are a comprehensive entity with a broad array of undergraduate majors and minors as well as graduate programs.&quot; Since becoming a university, Longwood has expanded its physical campus and academic offerings.

The John H. and Karen Chichester Science Center opened in 2005. Longwood&#x27;s Health and Fitness Center, which opened in 2007, was the first higher education building in Virginia to be awarded the gold level of LEED certification. A new 41,983-square-foot Center for Communication Studies and Theater opened in 2009 to house the rapidly growing communication studies major. That building is adjacent to Bedford Hall, home of the art program, which was expanded and renovated in 2012. Three residence halls were renovated between 2007–14: Wheeler Hall (2007), Cox Hall (2008) and Stubbs Hall (2014).

Two residence halls and a commons building opened in 2013 at Lancer Park, an off-campus apartment complex. The residence halls house about 450 students, in addition to the 264 students who were already living there in apartments and townhouses. Longwood has managed the complex since 2006.

Keeping with campus tradition, in 2004 three major campus buildings were named for former presidents. The dining hall was named Dorrill Dining Hall for William F. Dorrill, president from 1988–1996; the library was named Greenwood Library for Janet D. Greenwood (1981–1987); and Lancer Hall was named Willett Hall for Henry I. Willett Jr. (1967–1981).

The academics profile has increased as well since becoming a university, notably with the additions of nursing, environmental science, athletic training, animation and cybersecurity programs, among many others.On March 23, 2013, Longwood&#x27;s Board of Visitors introduced W. Taylor Reveley IV as the university&#x27;s 26th president. Reveley&#x27;s father, W. Taylor Reveley III, was the president of the College of William &amp; Mary, and his grandfather W. Taylor Reveley II was president of Hampden–Sydney College.

On September 23, 2015, the Commission on Presidential Debates named Longwood as the host for the 2016 United States vice presidential debate, which occurred on October 4, 2016.

==Academics==

Longwood University is a small, highly residential public university that offers more than 100 majors and minors across three main academic colleges. It requires every student who graduates to complete an internship, directed research or guided field experience in their field of study.

One of the centerpiece hands-on learning opportunities available to students is LU@YNP, an annual interdisciplinary program held at Yellowstone National Park that exposes participants to public issues in and around the park. In addition, students have the opportunity to study abroad at one of many faculty-led intensive study trips to places like Costa Rica, Thailand, and Greece.

Longwood is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

===Cook-Cole College of Arts and Sciences===

The largest college at Longwood, the Cook-Cole College of Arts and Sciences houses the core of the liberal arts offerings at the university and offers 18 majors with dozens of minors and concentrations.

The English and Modern Languages department at Longwood University awards the annual John Dos Passos Prize For Literature, founded in 1980. Notable past recipients include Graham Greene, Tom Wolfe, Shelby Foote, Paule Marshall, Ernest J. Gaines, E. Annie Proulx, and Sherman Alexie. The 2014 Dos Passos Prize winner was Ruth Ozeki.

The college is named for John Randall Cook &#x27;52 and Waverly Manson Cole, who endowed it in 2006.

===College of Business and Economics===

Longwood&#x27;s College of Business and Economics is accredited by Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International. It was originally accredited in 1998. Students of the college earn a bachelor of science degree.

===College of Education, Health, and Human Services===

Longwood&#x27;s College of Education, Health, and Human Services houses teacher preparation faculty alongside social work, communication sciences and disorders, health, physical education, therapeutic recreation, and kinesiology programs. The college also offers online speech language pathology courses to prepare students for graduate-level coursework.

===College of Graduate and Professional Studies===

Students of the College of Graduate and Professional Studies earn a master of science or master of education degree. A fully online Masters of Business Administration is also offered.

Professional studies offer for-credit teacher licensure/recertification courses, Speech Language Pathology prerequisite courses (SLP Online), and courses for the educational leadership endorsement. A variety of non-credit classes are offered for teacher recertification including partnerships with the Virginia Holocaust Museum and the Virginia Museum of History &amp; Culture.

===Cormier Honors College===

Founded in 1983 as the Arts &amp; Sciences Honor Program, the Honors College was named for outgoing President Patricia P. Cormier in 2008. Cormier Scholars are an elite group of selected students who mostly live together in a learning-enriched environment and enjoy smaller classes, close interaction with faculty members, increased opportunities for independent undergraduate research and an emphasis on experiential learning outside the classroom.

==Campus==
Longwood&#x27;s main campus comprises approximately 154 acres (0.62 km2) near downtown Farmville, Virginia, in a triangle bordered by High Street, Griffin Boulevard and Main Street.

The architecture of the campus ranges from its more historic &quot;north core&quot; to its more contemporary southern end organized along a central promenade, Brock Commons. The north core stretches along High Street and consists of four historic brick Jeffersonian buildings: French Hall, Tabb Hall, the Rotunda, and Grainger Hall. These buildings are joined by a covered colonnade and bear the university&#x27;s signature red roofs.

The rest of campus is organized along a picturesque central promenade, Brock Commons, that stretches south perpendicular to High Street. Located along Brock Commons are the university&#x27;s dining hall, student union, library, gymnasium, music and arts buildings and the homes of the College of Business and Economics and the College of Education and Human Services. A new student center, the Norman H. and Elsie Stossel Upchurch University Center, opened in 2018 on the site of the former Cunningham residence hall. At the south end of Brock Commons sits the Health and Fitness Center, an 80,000-square-foot facility that features an indoor track, basketball and racquetball courts, a climbing room and exercise equipment. It was completed in 2007 and is certified GOLD by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).
===Off-campus housing===

Across Main Street, a retail/student housing complex called Longwood Landings was completed in 2006. This complex housed the university&#x27;s bookstore until 2018.

Lancer Park (formerly known as Stanley Park) sits north of the main campus and includes several athletic fields and facilities, two residence halls and several townhouse and apartment buildings. It is accessible from the main campus by pedestrian bridges.

Longwood Village consists of eight buildings 2.5 miles away from the main campus, the Longwood Village is currently unoccupied.

===Longwood Center for the Visual Arts===

The art museum of Longwood University, Longwood Center for the Visual Arts, or LCVA as it is more commonly known, was established in 1978 to house the university&#x27;s substantial museum collections and further foster an appreciation of art among the student body. The LCVA moved into its current home on Main Street, just off main campus, in 1993. Annually it serves more than 38,000 children, adults and students, who enjoy its exhibitions, workshops and lectures.

In 2014, the LCVA formalized an agreement to assume control of the Folk Art Society of America. In the agreement, the LCVA will serve as a repository for an invaluable collection of primary Folk Art source material, publish its annual magazine, and manage its growing ranks of several hundred members. The LCVA currently holds an impressive collection of folk art.In addition to operating the museum, the LCVA partners with several regional school systems to supplement art education.

===Hull Springs Farm===

Longwood also operates Hull Springs Farm, a 662-acre plantation on two tributaries of the Potomac River in Westmoreland County, Virginia. The plantation was bequeathed to Longwood by Mary Farley Ames Lee, class of 1938, in 1999. It is currently the site of several environmental and archaeological research studies.

===Sustainability===

Longwood annually saves about $4.5 million in fuel costs by using woody biomass (sawdust). Nearly all of the campus&#x27; heat and hot water are provided by burning woody biomass, mostly pine and some hardwood, which is a byproduct from local sawmills. Longwood is the only public institution of higher education in Virginia and one of only two state agencies that burns biomass for heating fuel, which the university has done since 1983.

===Longwood House===
Southeast of the university&#x27;s main campus is the Longwood House, a home built in 1811 but was burned and rebuilt in 1815 by Nathaniel E. Venable. The estate on which the home sits is the historic home of the Venable and Barber families and the namesake of the university. Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston was born in a house on the estate that no longer exists. The estate was purchased in 1928 by the State Teachers College and has been used as the home of the Longwood president since 1969.

==Athletics==


Longwood University&#x27;s 14 varsity athletics programs, known as the Lancers, compete at the NCAA Division I level. Thirteen of those teams compete in the Big South Conference, while field hockey is a member of the Mid-American Conference.

Longwood has six varsity men&#x27;s teams, including baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer and tennis. Longwood&#x27;s eight women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball and tennis.
The program has produced a number of professional athletes, most notably Jerome Kersey (NBA), Michael Tucker (MLB), and Tina Barrett (LPGA), all of whom were part of the school&#x27;s inaugural Athletics Hall of Fame Class in 2006. Alumnus Mark Montgomery is also currently a relief pitcher in the New York Yankees organization.

The Longwood softball program won Big South Championships in 2013, 2015, and 2016, three of their first four years of conference membership. The Lancers earned an automatic bid to an NCAA Regional all three times, becoming Longwood&#x27;s first program in the Division I era to reach the NCAA postseason. They won one game in the 2015 tournament, and two in 2016. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball programs won the 2022 Big South Conference Tournaments and both received bids to the 2022 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball tournaments. The men&#x27;s basketball team won the 2024 Big South Conference Tournament and received a bid to the 2024 NCAA Division I tournament.

===Club sports===

Longwood also has many club sports, including rugby, baseball, football, men&#x27;s lacrosse, roller hockey, golf, and others. The Men&#x27;s Rugby Team took 3rd place in USA Rugby&#x27;s Division 3 National Tournament in 2007, and again in 2009. In 2011 Men&#x27;s Rugby won the National Championship. The 2010-2011 season ended with the Lancers ranked #1 in the nation for Division III schools. They beat Occidental College (CA) in the National Championship by the score of 36-27 on May 1 in Virginia Beach, VA. The National Championship is the school&#x27;s first. The club baseball team in their second year of competition made it to the Division II club baseball world series in Johnstown, PA. They went 2-2 and finished 4th.

==Student life==
Located in Farmville, Virginia, Longwood is within 65 miles of three of Virginia&#x27;s urban centers: Richmond (65 miles), Charlottesville (60 miles) and Lynchburg (45 miles). In addition to existing adjacent to one of Southside Virginia&#x27;s historic downtowns, there are several outdoors opportunities available to students. The 31-mile High Bridge Trail is a short walk from campus, and the centerpiece of the path, the nearly half-mile long High Bridge, is just four miles from campus and easily accessible by bicycle or foot. The Appomattox River, a popular canoeing destination, also runs a short walk from campus. The Appalachian Trail is a short drive west, and there are several golf courses nearby.

===Greek life===

Longwood is the birthplace of four national sororities, referred to as the Farmville Four: Kappa Delta in 1897, Sigma Sigma Sigma in 1898, Zeta Tau Alpha in 1898 and Alpha Sigma Alpha in 1901. Today, twenty Greek organizations operate on campus.

===Secret societies===

Longwood is home to three secret societies: CHI, Princeps, and Cahoots.CHI was founded on October 15, 1900, and serves to promote the Longwood spirit. Members are secretly tapped and revealed only at the conclusion of their senior year during the annual CHI Burning, a large burning held on campus. CHI members at times leave &quot;CHI droppings&quot; on campus, and it is considered rare for someone to find one. Members of CHI, hidden beneath blue robes, occasionally process through campus in what are known as &quot;CHI walks.&quot; CHI is represented around campus by an image of the Rotunda painted on the sidewalk. It is considered bad luck to step on the CHI symbol.
Princeps was founded on seven principles of leadership and also keeps member identities secret until a revealing their senior year. The organization honors academically successful students each year by posting their symbol—a seven-pointed crown—on the residence hall doors of each student who makes the dean&#x27;s or president&#x27;s list. Princeps&#x27; crown symbol also appears on campus sidewalks, but it is considered good luck to step or jump on the symbol before exams.

===Joan of Arc===

Longwood adopted a patron hero, Joan of Arc. The university&#x27;s three sculptures of the 15th-century French heroine are French sculptor Henri-Michel-Antoine Chapu&#x27;s 1870 plaster statue officially titled Jeanne d&#x27;Arc, and known affectionately as &quot;Joanie on the Stony&quot;; Anna Hyatt Huntington&#x27;s 1915 bronze Joan of Arc equestrian statue, nicknamed &quot;Joanie on the Pony&quot;; and Alexander Stoddart&#x27;s heroic monument, dedicated on November 9, 2018. In October 2009, Joanie on the Pony was vandalized. After being restored, she was placed in the Rotunda in April 2010.

<doc id="345845" wikidata="Q266994" url="?curid=345845" title="XYZ Affair">
<text>The XYZ Affair was a political and diplomatic episode in 1797 and 1798, early in the presidency of John Adams, involving a confrontation between the United States and Republican France that led to the Quasi-War. The name derives from the substitution of the letters X, Y, and Z for the names of French diplomats Jean-Conrad Hottinguer (X), Pierre Bellamy (Y), and Lucien Hauteval (Z) in documents released by the Adams administration.

An American diplomatic commission was sent to France in July 1797 to negotiate a solution to problems that were threatening to break out into war. The diplomats, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, John Marshall, and Elbridge Gerry, were approached through informal channels by agents of the French foreign minister, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, who demanded bribes and a loan before formal negotiations could begin. Although it was widely known that diplomats from other nations had paid bribes to deal with Talleyrand at the time, the Americans were offended by the demands, and eventually left France without ever engaging in formal negotiations. Gerry, seeking to avoid all-out war, remained for several months after the other two commissioners left. His exchanges with Talleyrand laid groundwork for the eventual end to diplomatic affairs and military hostilities.

The failure of the commission caused a political firestorm in the United States when the commission&#x27;s dispatches were published. It led to the undeclared Quasi-War (1798–1800). Federalists, who controlled both houses of Congress and held the presidency, took advantage of the national anger to build up the nation&#x27;s military. They also attacked the Democratic-Republicans for their pro-French stance, and Gerry (a nonpartisan at the time) for what they saw as his role in the commission&#x27;s failure.

== Background ==

In the wake of the 1789 French Revolution, relations between the new French Republic and U.S. federal government, originally friendly, became strained. In 1792, France and the rest of Europe went to war, a conflict in which President George Washington declared American neutrality. However, both France and Great Britain, the major naval powers in the war, seized ships of neutral powers (including those of the United States) that traded with their enemies. With the Jay Treaty, ratified in 1795, the United States reached an agreement on the matter with Britain that angered members of the Directory that governed France. The French Navy consequently stepped up its efforts to interrupt American trade with Britain. By the end of Washington&#x27;s presidency in early 1797, the matter was reaching crisis proportions. Shortly after assuming office on March 4, 1797, President John Adams learned that Charles Cotesworth Pinckney had been refused as U.S. minister because of the escalating crisis, and that American merchant ships had been seized in the Caribbean. In response, he called upon Congress to meet and address the deteriorating state of French–American relations during a special session to be held that May.

Popular opinion in the United States on relations with France was divided along largely political lines: Federalists took a hard line, favoring a defensive buildup but not necessarily advocating war, while Democratic-Republicans expressed solidarity with the republican ideals of the French revolutionaries and did not want to be seen as cooperating with the Federalist Adams administration. Vice President Thomas Jefferson, himself a republican, looked upon Federalists as monarchists who were linked to Britain and therefore hostile to American values.

==Commission to France==

In late May 1797 Adams met with his cabinet to discuss the situation and to choose a special commission to France. Adams initially proposed that John Marshall and Elbridge Gerry join Pinckney on the commission, but his cabinet objected to the choice of Gerry because he was not a strong Federalist. Francis Dana was chosen instead of Gerry, but he declined to serve, and Adams, who considered Gerry one of the &quot;two most impartial men in America&quot; (he himself being the other), submitted his name to the United States Senate in Dana&#x27;s stead without consulting his cabinet. Adams, in introducing the matter to Congress, made a somewhat belligerent speech in which he called for a vigorous defense of the nation&#x27;s neutrality and expansion of the United States Navy, but stopped short of calling for war against France. Congress approved this choice of commissioners, and Adams instructed them to negotiate similar terms to those that had been granted to Britain in the Jay Treaty. The commissioners were also instructed to refuse loans, but to be flexible in the arrangement of payment terms for financial matters. Marshall left for Europe in mid-July to join Pinckney, with Gerry following a few weeks later. The political divisions in the commission&#x27;s makeup were reflected in their attitudes toward the negotiations: Marshall and Pinckney, both Federalists, distrusted the French, while Gerry (who was then opposed to political parties) was willing to be flexible and unhurried in dealing with them.

The French Republic, established in 1792 at the height of the French Revolution, was by 1797 governed by a bicameral legislative assembly, with a five-member French Directory acting as the national executive. The Directory was undergoing both internal power struggles and struggles with the Council of Five Hundred, the lower chamber of the legislature. Ministerial changes took place in the first half of 1797, including the selection in July of Charles Maurice de Talleyrand as foreign minister. Talleyrand, who had recently spent a few years in the United States, was openly concerned about the establishment of closer ties between the U.S. and Britain. The Directory, generally not well-disposed to American interests, became notably more hostile to them in September 1797, when an internal coup propelled several anti-Americans into power. These leaders, and Talleyrand, viewed President Adams as hostile to their interests, but did not think that there was significant danger of war. In part based on advice imparted to French diplomats by Jefferson, Talleyrand decided to adopt a measured, slow pace to the negotiations.
The American commission arrived in Paris in early October, and immediately requested a meeting with Talleyrand. After an initial brief meeting (in which Talleyrand only provisionally accepted the commissioners&#x27; credentials), a longer meeting was held a week later. Talleyrand sought from the commissioners an explanation for the speech Adams had made in May, which had angered Directory members; his motivation was to determine how favorably the commissioners were disposed to the negotiations. If they responded in an unfavorable manner, the Directory would refuse to accept their credentials. The commissioners first learned of Talleyrand&#x27;s expected demand on October 14 through an indirect channel. They decided that no explanation would be given for Adams&#x27; speech.

===Initial meetings===
What followed were a series of meetings that took place outside formal diplomatic channels. On October 17, Nicholas Hubbard, an Englishman working for a Dutch bank used by the Americans (and who came to be identified as &quot;W&quot; in the published papers), notified Pinckney that Baron Jean-Conrad Hottinguer, whom Hubbard described only as a man of honor, wished to meet with him. Pinckney agreed, and the two men met the next evening. Hottinguer (who was later identified as &quot;X&quot;) relayed a series of French demands, which included a large loan to the French government and the payment of a £50,000 bribe to Talleyrand. Pinckney relayed these demands to the other commissioners, and Hottinguer repeated them to the entire commission, which curtly refused the demands, even though it was widely known that diplomats from other nations had paid bribes to deal with Talleyrand. Hottinguer then introduced the commission to Pierre Bellamy (&quot;Y&quot;), whom he represented as being a member of Talleyrand&#x27;s inner circle. Bellamy expounded in detail on Talleyrand&#x27;s demands, including the expectation that &quot;you must pay a great deal of money&quot;. He even proposed a series of purchases (at inflated prices) of currency as a means by which such money could be clandestinely exchanged. The commissioners offered to send one of their number back to the United States for instructions, if the French would suspend their seizures of American shipping; the French negotiators refused.
Not long after this standoff, Talleyrand sent Lucien Hauteval (&quot;Z&quot;) to meet with Elbridge Gerry. The two men knew each other, having met in Boston in 1792. Hauteval assured Gerry of Talleyrand&#x27;s sincerity in seeking peace, and encouraged him to keep the informal negotiations open. He reiterated the demands for a loan and bribe.

A week later (notably after the signing of the Treaty of Campo Formio, which ended the five-year War of the First Coalition between France and most of the other European powers), Hottinguer and Bellamy again met with the commission, and repeated their original demands, accompanied by threats of potential war, since France was at least momentarily at peace in Europe. Pinckney&#x27;s response was famous: &quot;No, no, not a sixpence!&quot; The commissioners decided on November 1 to refuse further negotiations by informal channels. Publication of dispatches describing this series of meetings would form the basis for the later political debates in the United States.

===Later negotiations===
The commissioners soon discovered that only unofficial channels were open to them. Over the next several months, Talleyrand sent a series of informal negotiators to meet with and influence the commissioners. Some of the informal avenues were closed down (Gerry, for instance, informed Hauteval that they could no longer meet, since Hauteval had no formal authority), and Talleyrand finally appeared in November 1797 at a dinner, primarily to castigate the Americans for their unwillingness to accede to the demand for a bribe.
In late November, Talleyrand began maneuvering to separate Gerry from the other commissioners. He extended a &quot;social&quot; dinner invitation to Gerry, which the latter, seeking to maintain communications, planned to attend. The matter heightened distrust of Gerry by Marshall and Pinckney, who sought guarantees that Gerry would limit any representations and agreements he might consider. Despite seeking to refuse informal negotiations, all of the commissioners ended up having private meetings with some of Talleyrand&#x27;s negotiators.

The commissioners eventually divided over the issue of whether to continue informal negotiations, with the Federalists Marshall and Pinckney opposed, and Gerry in favor. This division was eventually clear to Talleyrand, who told Gerry in January 1798 that he would no longer deal with Pinckney. In February, Talleyrand gained approval from the Directory for a new bargaining position, and he maneuvered to exclude Marshall from the negotiations as well. The change in strategy alarmed a number of American residents of Paris, who reported the growing possibility of war. Around this time Gerry, at Talleyrand&#x27;s insistence, began keeping secret from the other commissioners the substance of their meetings.
All three commissioners met with Talleyrand informally in March, but it was clear that the parties were at an impasse. This appeared to be the case despite Talleyrand&#x27;s agreement to drop the demand for a loan. Both sides prepared statements to be sent across the Atlantic stating their positions, and Marshall and Pinckney, frozen out of talks that Talleyrand would only conduct with Gerry, left France in April. Their departure was delayed due to a series of negotiations over the return of their passports; in order to obtain diplomatic advantage, Talleyrand sought to force Marshall and Pinckney to formally request their return (which would allow him to later claim that they broke off negotiations). Talleyrand eventually gave in, formally requesting their departure. Gerry, although he sought to maintain unity with his co-commissioners, was told by Talleyrand that if he left France the Directory would declare war. Gerry remained behind, protesting the &quot;impropriety of permitting a foreign government to [choose] the person who should negotiate.&quot; He however remained optimistic that war was unrealistic, writing to William Vans Murray, the American minister to The Netherlands, that &quot;nothing but madness&quot; would cause the French to declare war.

Gerry resolutely refused to engage in further substantive negotiations with Talleyrand, agreeing only to stay until someone with more authority could replace him, and wrote to President Adams requesting assistance in securing his departure from Paris. Talleyrand eventually sent representatives to The Hague to reopen negotiations with William Vans Murray, and Gerry finally returned home in October 1798.

==Reaction in the United States==

While the American diplomats were in Europe, President Adams considered his options in the event of the commission&#x27;s failure. His cabinet urged that the nation&#x27;s military be strengthened, including the raising of a 20,000-man army and the acquisition or construction of ships of the line for the navy. He had no substantive word from the commissioners until March 1798, when the first dispatches revealing the French demands and negotiating tactics arrived. The commission&#x27;s apparent failure was duly reported to Congress, although Adams kept secret the mistreatment (lack of recognition and demand for a bribe) of the diplomats, seeking to minimize a warlike reaction. His cabinet was divided on how to react: the general tenor was one of hostility toward France, with Attorney General Charles Lee and Secretary of State Timothy Pickering arguing for a declaration of war. Democratic-Republican leaders in Congress, believing Adams had exaggerated the French position because he sought war, united with hawkish Federalists to demand the release of the commissioners&#x27; dispatches. On March 20, Adams turned them over, with the names of some of the French actors redacted and replaced by the letters W, X, Y, and Z. The use of these disguising letters led the business to immediately become known as the &quot;XYZ Affair.&quot;

The release of the dispatches produced exactly the response Adams feared. Federalists called for war, and Democratic-Republicans were left without an effective argument against them, having miscalculated the reason for Adams&#x27; secrecy. Despite those calls, Adams steadfastly refused to ask Congress for a formal war declaration. Congress nonetheless authorized the acquisition of twelve frigates, and made other appropriations to increase military readiness; it also, on July 7, 1798, voted to nullify the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France, and two days later authorized attacks on French warships.

===Partisan responses===
Federalists used the dispatches to question the loyalty of pro-French Democratic-Republicans; this attitude contributed to the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts, restricting the movements and actions of foreigners, and limiting speech critical of the government. Federalists were otherwise divided on the question of war, and the Democratic-Republicans painted hawkish Federalists as warmongers seeking to undermine the republic by military means.

Elbridge Gerry was placed in a difficult position upon his return to the United States. Federalists, spurred by John Marshall&#x27;s accounts of their disagreements, criticized him for abetting the breakdown of the negotiations. These bitterly harsh and partisan comments turned Gerry against the Federalists, and he eventually ended up joining with the Democratic-Republicans in 1800.

==Political reaction in France==

When news reached France of the publication of the dispatches and the ensuing hostile reaction, the response was one of fury. Talleyrand was called to the Directory to account for his role in the affair. He denied all association with the informal negotiators, and enlisted the assistance of Gerry in exposing the agents whose names had been redacted, a charade Gerry agreed to participate in. In exchange Talleyrand confirmed privately to Gerry that the agents were in fact in his employ, and that he was, contrary to statements made to the Directory, interested in pursuing reconciliation. President Adams later wrote that Talleyrand&#x27;s confession to Gerry was significant in his decision to continue efforts to maintain peace. Gerry, in his private report on the affair to Adams in 1799, claimed credit for maintaining the peace, and for influencing significant changes in French policy that lessened the hostilities and eventually brought a peace treaty.

The warlike attitude of the United States and the start of the Quasi-War (a naval war between the two countries that was fought primarily in the Caribbean) convinced Talleyrand that he had miscalculated in his dealings with the commissioners. In response to the diplomatic overtures he made to William Vans Murray in The Hague, President Adams sent negotiators to France in 1799 who eventually negotiated an end to hostilities with the Convention of 1800 (whose negotiations were managed in part by Marshall, then Secretary of State) in September 1800. This agreement was made with First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, who had overthrown the Directory in the Coup of 18 Brumaire in November 1799, and it was ratified by the United States Senate in December 1801.

<doc id="345848" wikidata="Q1421730" url="?curid=345848" title="Inclined orbit">
<text>A satellite is said to occupy an inclined orbit around Earth if the orbit exhibits an angle other than 0° to the equatorial plane. This angle is called the orbit&#x27;s inclination. A planet is said to have an inclined orbit around the Sun if it has an angle other than 0° to the ecliptic plane.

== Types of inclined orbits ==

=== Geosynchronous orbits ===

A geosynchronous orbit is an inclined orbit with an altitude of that completes one revolution every sidereal day tracing out a small figure-eight shape in the sky. A geostationary orbit is a special case of geosynchronous orbit with no inclination, and therefore no apparent movement across the sky from a fixed observation point on the Earth&#x27;s surface.

Due to their inherent instability, geostationary orbits will eventually become inclined if they are not corrected using thrusters. At the end of the satellite&#x27;s lifetime, when fuel approaches depletion, satellite operators may decide to omit these expensive manoeuvres to correct inclination and only control eccentricity. This prolongs the life-time of the satellite as it consumes less fuel over time, but the satellite can then only be used by ground antennas capable of following the north–south movement, satellite-tracking Earth stations.

===Polar orbits===

A polar orbit has an inclination of 90 degrees passing over the poles of the planet on each pass. These types of orbits are often used for earth observation and weather services.

===Sun-synchronous orbits===

This is a special type of orbit that precesses at the same rate that the sun moves along the ecliptic, causing the satellite to rise over a fixed location on the earth&#x27;s surface at the same mean solar time every day.

These orbits have an inclination governed by the equation:
:formula_1

where formula_2 is the orbital inclination, and formula_3 is the orbital period.

<text>Dingley Askham (died 12 July 1728) was an English attorney, latterly Principal of Barnard&#x27;s Inn in London.

==Biography==
Askham was a native of St. Ives, Huntingdonshire, and was admitted to Barnard&#x27;s Inn on 26 June 1694. He served as Principal of the Inn from 16 July 1722 until his death on 12 July 1728. He is commemorated by an armorial window in the Hall of the Inn and by a memorial in All Saints&#x27; Church in St. Ives.

==Dingley Askham junior==
Askham is often confused with his son of the same name, Dingley Askham junior (born c. 1695, also in St. Ives, and died 26 April 1781, aged 86). He was likewise admitted to Barnard&#x27;s Inn, on 19 June 1725, to undertake legal study. However, in 1729 he eloped with and married the daughter and heiress of Thomas Cotton of Conington, Cambridgeshire, who reportedly died of rage on hearing of the marriage, because of the low social status of his attorney son-in-law. Askham and his wife subsequently lived at the property she inherited, Conington Hall. He was involved in restoring Conington church in 1737. Later in life, he was a justice of the peace and a well-respected huntsman.

The bottom third of it is the Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta, which includes 244 guest rooms and is the only 5-star hotel in Midtown. It is the eleventh-tallest skyscraper in Atlanta. The building was designed by Rabun Hogan Ota Rasche Architects, and built by Beers Construction of Atlanta.

The GLG Grand building is notable for several reasons. First, it was Atlanta&#x27;s first mixed-use skyscraper, incorporating hotel, office and condominiums into one building. Several skyscrapers of the same type are on the drawing boards, but they have yet to break ground. Second, it was a dismal failure for its developer, G. Lars Gullstedt (1935-2015) of Sweden, who made headlines in Atlanta in 1991 by buying up huge parcels of run-down land in Midtown and proposing a massive multi-block mixed-use development to be called &quot;GLG Park Plaza.&quot; The GLG Grand, which took its name from Gullstedt&#x27;s initials, was an unrelated development of Gullstedt&#x27;s on 14th Street, several blocks north. The building opened in 1992 to a depressed real estate market, and its condominiums and office space sat largely vacant. Gullstedt, who was also a developer in Sweden, was forced into bankruptcy there, and lost control of all of his Atlanta holdings including this building. Only later, in the mid-2000s, did his former Midtown parcels begin to be developed, coming just before the economic downturn of the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

The hotel in the building was originally called the GLG Grand Hotel, then the Occidental Grand Hotel, before becoming the Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta in the late 1990s.

<doc id="345867" wikidata="Q7187879" url="?curid=345867" title="Photopia">
<text>Photopia is a piece of literature by Adam Cadre rendered in the form of interactive fiction, and written in Inform. It has received both praise and criticism for its heavy focus on fiction rather than on interactivity. It won first place in the 1998 Interactive Fiction Competition.
&quot;Photopia&quot; has few puzzles and a linear structure, allowing the player no way to alter the eventual conclusion but maintaining the illusion of non-linearity.

==Development==
Adam Cadre has stated that &quot;Photopia&quot; was heavily influenced by &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;, a film that prominently features a babysitter and a bus crash.

He submitted &quot;Photopia&quot; to the 1998 Interactive Fiction Competition pseudonymously. He felt that his previous game &quot;I-0&quot; would inspire certain expectations in players, since in that game the playable character is a young college student who could be instructed to undress. Years later, he dropped the pretense that there was a real &quot;Opal O&#x27;Donnell&quot; who had submitted Photopia for him, stating: &quot;it started to bother me that v1.0 of the Phaq had lies in it.&quot;

==Reception==
At the 1998 XYZZY Awards, the game won in the Best Writing and Best Story categories, and was nominated for Best Game, Best NPCs, Best Individual Puzzle, Best Individual NPC, and Best Use of Medium. In 1999, XYZZYnews gave the game a positive review, calling it an &quot;amazing piece of work&quot;. In 2007, Emily Short described the game as &quot;hugely influential&quot; and &quot;ground-breaking.&quot; In 2012, while reviewing Winter Lake&#x27;s &quot;Rat Chaos&quot;, Short hyperlinked &quot;Photopia&quot; as a game that &quot;plays with agency not in the usual ways [...] discovering you have none.&quot;

In 2015, the game won first place in the Interactive Fiction Database&#x27;s &quot;Interactive Fiction Top 50 of all time&quot; contest.

<text>Brentwood is a suburban neighborhood in the Westside region of Los Angeles, California.

==History==
===General===
Modern development began after the establishment of the Pacific Branch of the National Home for Disabled Soldiers and Sailors in the 1880s. A small community sprang up outside that facility&#x27;s west gate, taking on the name &quot;Westgate&quot;. Annexed by the City of Los Angeles on June 14, 1916, Westgate&#x27;s included large parts of what is now Pacific Palisades and a small portion of today&#x27;s Bel-Air. Westgate Avenue is one of the last reminders of that namesake.
Local traditions include a Maypole erected each year on the lawn of the Archer School for Girls, carrying on that set by the Eastern Star Home previously housed there. This building was the exterior establishing shot for the &quot;Mar Vista Rest Home&quot; that provided a key scene in the 1974 film &quot;Chinatown&quot;.

===Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone designation===

The State Cal-Fire Authority officially designated Brentwood, from Mulholland down to Sunset Boulevard, a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, due to the long, uninterrupted border of urban-wildlife interface in the hillsides that has resulted in multiple fires over many years, destroying entire neighborhoods and requiring numerous evacuations. For this reason, the Brentwood community has been strongly in favor of halting all further development in the hillside and canyon areas.

On November 6, 1961, a construction crew working in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley north of Brentwood on the far side of the Santa Monica Mountains noticed smoke and flames in a nearby pile of rubbish. Within minutes, Santa Ana winds gusting up to sent burning brush aloft and over the ridge into Brentwood.

More than 300 police officers helped evacuate 3,500 residents during the 12-hour fire, and some 2,500 firefighters battled the blaze, pumping water from neighborhood swimming pools to douse flames. Pockets of the fire smoldered for several days. Even as firefighters battled what was to become a Bel Air disaster, another fire erupted in Santa Ynez Canyon to the west. That blaze was contained the next day after consuming nearly and nine structures and burning to within a mile of Bel Air and Brentwood. The fires were the fifth-worst conflagration in the nation&#x27;s history at the time, burning , destroying 484 homes and 190 other structures and causing an estimated $30 million in damage.

===O. J. Simpson murder case===

Brentwood was the site of the 1994 stabbing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, outside Nicole Brown Simpson&#x27;s Bundy Drive townhouse. Nicole&#x27;s ex-husband, football player and actor O. J. Simpson, was acquitted of the murders, but was later found liable for the deaths in a civil trial. O. J. Simpson&#x27;s Brentwood home was subsequently sold. The new owners demolished Simpson&#x27;s home and built a new residence.

==Geography==

===Boundaries===
The district is located at the base of the Santa Monica Mountains, bounded by the San Diego Freeway on the east, Wilshire Boulevard on the south, the Santa Monica city limits on the southwest, Sullivan Canyon/Westridge Trail on the west and Mulholland Drive on the north.

===Environment===

Brentwood, like nearby Santa Monica, has a temperate climate influenced by water breezes off the Pacific Ocean. Residents frequently wake to a &quot;marine layer&quot;, sunshine and birds singing. The topography is generally split into two characters, broadly divided by Sunset Boulevard: the area north of Sunset is defined by ridges and canyons of the Santa Monica Mountains and is located in a Cal-Fire designated Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone; south of Sunset the area is mostly flat. The area south of San Vicente Boulevard features an underground spring which bubbles up into a small creek along &quot;the Gully&quot; near the Brentwood Country Club.
== Demographics ==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 31,344 residents in the Brentwood neighborhood—or . In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 33,312.

The population was 84.2% Non-Hispanic White, 6.5% Asian American, 4.5% Hispanic or Latino, 1.2% African American, and 3.6% of other origins. Iran (27.2%) and the United Kingdom (4.8%) were the most common places of birth for the 21.1% of the residents who were born abroad—which was a low percentage for Los Angeles as a whole. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $112,927, high for the city of Los Angeles as well as the county.

==Notable sights==


San Vicente Boulevard is divided by a wide median on which stand many large coral trees. This green belt replaced a Pacific Electric trolley track, and the trees have been named a City of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.

Brentwood features a number of residential sub-districts:
*Brentwood Circle: a gated community east of Barrington and north of Sunset that was created when the Getty Museum was built. 
*Brentwood Glen: an area bounded by Sunset, the 405 Freeway, and the Veterans Administration, it is an enclave of small lots and single family homes
*Bundy Canyon: home to Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College and an emergency ingress entrance to Getty Center (though the latter is accessible only from Sepulveda for the public)
*Crestwood Hills: includes a cluster of protected, architecturally significant mid-century modern residences located in the northern part of Kenter Canyon
*Mandeville Canyon: westernmost part of Brentwood, north of Sunset; extends about three miles to the north and is the longest dead end street in the City of Los Angeles.
*Sullivan Canyon: a mostly equestrian neighborhood with a private riding ring.
*The &quot;Polo Field&quot;: situated at Will Rogers State Park near Paul Revere Middle School and the Riviera Golf Club
*Brentwood Park: large estates located in a zone bordered by Oakmont, San Vicente, Allenford and Cliffwood Drive.
*Brentwood Terrace: Located between the Brentwood Country Mart and Brentwood Country Club

Each sub-district is represented by a different homeowners association.

==Recreation==

Brentwood&#x27;s Barrington Recreation Center has an indoor gymnasium which converts into a small auditorium with a capacity of 250. Outdoors is a lighted baseball diamond, an unlighted baseball diamond, lighted indoor basketball courts, lighted outdoor basketball courts, a children&#x27;s play area, picnic tables and lighted tennis courts. As of March 2018, Barrington Park received a grade of &quot;D&quot; from the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department due its poor facilities; upon investigation, the Brentwood Community Council discovered $1.1 million in missing funds that were supposed to be used for capital upgrades at the park and successfully fought the city for their return. With the funds back in place, the Community has worked to improve the park. The Barrington Dog Park is across the street from the recreation center and is part of Barrington Veterans Park, which is owned by the West LA VA and leased to the City of Los Angeles.

==Economy and businesses==


The vast majority of office space in Brentwood is rented to professional services firms: accountants, lawyers, medical care.

There are three upscale commercial areas: Brentwood Country Mart, Barrington Plaza and the San Vicente Business District, which include restaurants, clothing stores, and other high-end retailers.

A few long time businesses should be noted: Brent-Air Pharmacy, run by the founding Lassoff family from its inception until June 2007, served Brentwood for more than 50 years. The drug store has been the scene of many famous scandals and, like its defunct West Hollywood cousin Schwab&#x27;s, is known as the pharmacy to the stars, where many now-notable actors and actresses worked as delivery boys or &quot;candy counter&quot; girls.

The Brentwood Country Mart, near the corner of San Vicente Blvd and 26th Street next to the Santa Monica city limit, is a shopping and food center that first opened in 1948.

Vicente Foods is an independently owned and operated grocery market that has served Brentwood since 1948. Other local markets include Whole Foods and Ralphs.

A popular area for dining and coffee for local residents is located in Brentwood Village at the intersection of Barrington and Sunset. More than a dozen restaurants and coffee shops are located within a two-block stretch offering a wide variety of cuisine.

Dutton&#x27;s Brentwood Books, a local landmark called by &quot;Sunset&quot; magazine &quot;the last of the truly independent bookstores&quot;, closed its doors in April 2008.

==Government and infrastructure==
===Brentwood leadership and city services===
Brentwood and Pacific Palisades both chose to form community councils in order to have an independent voice with regard to issues that impact their communities, such as their joint Community Plan, which is a City approved document that governs the aesthetics of zoning and design for the neighborhoods. The Brentwood Community Council holds monthly public meetings, as does its Land Use Committee, and has been a powerful and effective voice for the community since the 1990s. The BCC Board includes members from all local HOA&#x27;s, plus members representing schools, business, environment, transportation, civic affairs and a group dedicated only to residents under 40, called Brentwood &#x27;49. City Services are provided by the Los Angeles Fire Department Station 19 in Brentwood. The Los Angeles Police Department operates the West Los Angeles Community Police Station in West Los Angeles, serving Brentwood. The City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power provide utilities. All areas of Brentwood are served by a Residents Association of some kind.

===West LA VA and VA Master Plan Redevelopment===
While the annual County of Los Angeles homeless count rarely attributes more than 50 persons as homeless in Brentwood, the majority of the homeless persons are Veterans. While the VA does have available beds and treatment programs, many Veterans find it hard to take the first step to accept VA assistance for a variety of reasons, including deep mistrust of the VA, dishonorable discharges that prevent them from receiving services, the mandatory sober living environment on the VA campus. The Brentwood Community Council took the lead in 2013 to help establish Veteran safe parking and safe camping programs, which allow Veterans to take an &#x27;intermediate step&quot; between homelessness and accepting full VA assistance and these programs have been successful and have grown over time. Some Veterans believed the VA was derelict in its duty to provide housing and successfully sued the VA, proving that multiple leases of VA property had been used for fraudulent means. Several individuals went to prison, including a former VA executive. As a result of the settlement in the Veterans civil suit against the VA, the $1B VA Master Plan Redevelopment of the West LA VA property, including 2000+ units of housing, was approved by Congress in 2019 and was completed in late 2020.

===County===
The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services SPA 5 West Area Health Office serves Brentwood. The Supervisor for this area is Lindsey Horvath.

===State===
Brentwood is represented in the California State Senate by Ben Allen and in the California State Assembly by Richard Bloom.

===Federal===
The United States Postal Service operates the Barrington Post Office in Brentwood. Ted Lieu represents the area in the U.S. House of Representatives.

==Education==


Seventy percent of Brentwood residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, a high percentage for the city and the county. The percentages of residents in that age range with a bachelor&#x27;s degree or greater were high for the county.

===Primary and secondary education===
Schools within the Brentwood borders are as follows:

The public elementary schools in the area are Kenter Canyon Elementary School (an LAUSD charter school) and Brentwood Science Magnet Elementary School (an LAUSD alternative school). Paul Revere Charter Middle School is Brentwood&#x27;s public middle school. High school students are zoned to University High School in West Los Angeles, and Palisades Charter High School, in the nearby neighborhood of Pacific Palisades.

The following private schools are located in the Brentwood area:

<text>GANDALF was an acronym (&quot;[[GANDALF trial|G]]reen [[GANDALF trial|A]]narchist&quot; and ALF) for the 1997 trial in the UK of the editors of &quot;Green Anarchist&quot; magazine, as well as two prominent British supporters of the Animal Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front Supporters Group (ALF SG), on charges of conspiracy to incite criminal damage.

Beginning in 1995, the Hampshire police under &quot;Operation Washington&quot; began a series of at least 56 raids, which resulted in the August–November 1997 trial in Portsmouth of &quot;Green Anarchist&quot; editors Steven Booth, Saxon Burchnall-Wood, Noel Molland, and Paul Rogers, as well as the ALF UK press officer Robin Webb and ALF SG newsletter editor Simon Russell. The defendants organized the GANDALF defence campaign. The editors of &quot;Green Anarchist&quot;—Molland, Burchnall-Wood and Booth—were sentenced to three years in jail for conspiracy to incite criminal damage. After four and a half months, all three were released pending an appeal, and their convictions were later overturned.

<text>The Quad Cities River Bandits are a Minor League Baseball team of the Midwest League and the High-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals. Their home games are played at Modern Woodmen Park (formerly John O&#x27;Donnell Stadium) in Davenport, Iowa, one of the Quad Cities.

==History==
===1879–1959===
Beginning in 1879, Quad City area professional baseball has a history that includes three teams. Davenport, Moline (Moline Plowboys) and Rock Island (Rock Island Islanders) all have hosted minor league baseball teams. A fourth area team played in nearby Kewanee, Illinois. Minor league baseball began in Davenport with the 1879 Davenport Brown Stockings of the Northwestern League. With Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Bid McPhee on the roster, the Brown Stockings played with the Dubuque Red Stockings, Omaha Green Stockings and Rockford White Stockings, before the Northwestern League folded after one season. The Davenport Onion Weeders (1888), Davenport Hawkeyes (1889) and Davenport Pilgrims (1891) played before the turn of the 20th century in the Western Association (1888), Central Interstate League (1889) and the Illinois-Iowa League (1891).

In 1901, the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League or &quot;Three-I League&quot; was founded, with the Davenport River Rats and Rock Island Islanders as charter members. This Davenport team set the foundation of the franchise that exists today. Other charter members of the 1901 Three-I League were the Bloomington Blues, Cedar Rapids Rabbits, Decatur Commodores, Evansville River Rats, Rockford Red Sox and Terre Haute Hottentots. The Davenport franchise changed monikers frequently in the early years, playing as the Davenport River Rats (1901–04), Davenport Riversides (1905), Davenport Knickerbockers (1906), Davenport Prodigals (1909–12) and Davenport Blue Sox (1913–1916). The Davenport Blue Sox won the 1914 Three-I League Championship.
The third Quad City area team was added In July 1914. The Danville Speakers of the Three-I League relocated to Moline and the Moline Plowboys were established. The Moline Plowboys won Three-I League Championships in 1915, 1921 and 1937. A fourth area team, the nearby Kewanee Boilermakers, were members of the Class C Central Association (1908–1913 and 1948–1949). Kewanee won the 1949 Central Association Championship as the Kewanee A&#x27;s, affiliates of the Philadelphia Athletics (1948–1949) after Moline relocated to Kewanee in mid-season 1948. The Moline Plowboys/Moline A&#x27;s were affiliates of the Detroit Tigers (1922), St Louis Browns (1931–1932), Chicago Cubs (1937–1940) and the Philadelphia Athletics (1947–48). The Rock Island Islanders were affiliates of the St. Louis Browns (1932) and Cincinnati Reds (1933).

After folding in 1916, the Davenport Blue Sox resumed play in 1929. On May 26, 1931, the Davenport Blue Sox moved into newly built Municipal Stadium, nicknamed the &quot;Muny.&quot; The Davenport Blue Sox played in the Mississippi Valley League (1929–1933) and Western League (1934–1937). The Blue Sox were an affiliate of the Brooklyn Dodgers (1936–1937)

The Rock Island Islanders and Davenport Blue Sox faced each other in the Mississippi Valley League championship series in both 1932 and 1933. Rock Island won the 1932 Championship in six games. Davenport defeated the Islanders to win the 1933 Championship in the final season of the Mississippi Valley League. The 1933 Blue Sox were led by Ed Hall&#x27;s 151 RBI and Como Cotelle&#x27;s .407 average. The 1936 Blue Sox continued the strong decade, winning the 1936 Western League Championship.

The 1933 Davenport Blue Sox were ranked in The National Baseball Association&#x27;s top 100 minor league teams (#58). Davenport finished the regular season with a record of 83–32 before defeating the neighboring Rock Island Islanders in the 1933 Mississippi Valley League championship series.

The Davenport Blue Sox and Rock Island Islanders were both members of the Western League when the Rock Island Islanders franchise folded on July 7, 1937. The Western League itself then folded after the season, leaving Davenport without a team until 1946. The Rock Island Islanders franchise never played again. The Moline A&#x27;s (1947–1948) moved to become the Kewanee A&#x27;s (1948–1949), who folded permanently along with the Central Association in 1949. Moline played home games at Browning Field and Rock Island at Douglas Park. Both Browning Field and Douglas Park are in use today.

After a nine-season baseball hiatus during World War II, baseball returned to Davenport in 1946. The Davenport Cubs (1946–1947) rejoined the Class B Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League (Three-I League) as an affiliate of the Chicago Cubs. Led by future MLB players Roy Smalley Jr. and Rube Walker, the 1946 Davenport Cubs won the regular season pennant. 

The Davenport Pirates (1948–1949) were an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bob Purkey, Frank Thomas and future Cy Young Award Winner Vern Law were on the 1949 Pirates. The Pirates swept Evansville, 3 games to 0, to win the 1949 Three-I League Championship. In 1949 Davenport drew 133,505 fans, a franchise record that would stand until 1981.

Remaining in the Three-I League, the 1950 Davenport Quads operated as an Independent team. The Davenport Tigers (1951–1952) were an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers (1951–1952). Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Jim Bunning pitched for the 1951 Tigers. Baseball Hall of Fame announcer Milo Hamilton was the Tigers&#x27; announcer on radio. Harvey Kuenn played for the 1952 Tigers, hitting .340. Kuehn was called up to the Detroit Tigers after the 1952 Davenport season ended and won the 1953 Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award.

After the 1952 season Davenport folded, and were replaced by the Peoria Chiefs in the 1953 Three-I League. Davenport remained without a team for four seasons. The 1957 Davenport DavSox (1957–1958) rejoined the Three-I League as an affiliate of the Chicago White Sox (1957–1958). The 1958 DavSox advanced to the Three-I championship series, where they were defeated by the Cedar Rapids Braves 3 games to 2. The 1958 season was the last for Davenport in the Three-I League.

===Midwest League (1960–present)===
Despite finishing third in the league in attendance (61,522), the DavSox moved to Lincoln, Nebraska after the 1958 season to become the Lincoln Chiefs (who drew 44,783 in the 1959 Three-I League) . This left Davenport without a team for the 1959 season. As a result, local businessman Hugo &quot;Hooks&quot; Kohn started a drive to bring a new team to Davenport. Hooks Kohn was a local baseball enthusiast and a leading pioneer/player of &quot;Diamond Ball&quot;, a Davenport game that evolved into today&#x27;s softball. With Kohn heading the Quad City Baseball Fans Association, a team was secured for the 1960 season as a Milwaukee Braves affiliate, with Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Travis Jackson becoming the 1960 Manager. The Quad City Baseball Fans Association would oversee operation of the Davenport franchise from 1960 through 1986.

The 1960 Davenport Braves became a member of the fledgling Midwest League, a partnership that has continued without interruption in seven decades. The 1960 Davenport Braves joined the Waterloo Hawks, Keokuk Cardinals, Dubuque Packers, Clinton C-Sox, Kokomo Dodgers, Quincy Giants and Decatur Commodores to form the 8-team 1960 Midwest League. The creation of the Midwest League essentially ended the Three-I, which folded after the 1961 season. In its long history, the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League hosted teams in 31 cities.

In 1961, the franchise permanently dropped &quot;Davenport&quot; and became the &quot;Quad City&quot; Braves. In 1962, the Quad City Angels became an affiliate of the expansion Los Angeles Angels. The affiliate change occurred because Cedar Rapids, also a Braves affiliate, was one of six former Three-I teams that joined the Midwest League in 1962 when the Three-I folded. Thus began a lengthy franchise affiliation with the Angels. The Quad City Angels of 1963 and 1964 were managed by Chuck Tanner and the 1964 Angels became the first Midwest League franchise to draw more than 100,000 fans in a season. The Quad City Angels won the 1968 and 1971 Midwest League titles. 

The Angels affiliation ran from 1962 through the 1992 season, minus the six-year affiliation with the Chicago Cubs (1979–1984), with the Quad Cities Cubs winning the 1979 Midwest League Championship. Quad Cities was an affiliate of the Houston Astros (1993–1998), Minnesota Twins (1999–2004), St. Louis Cardinals (2005–2012) Houston Astros (2013–2020), and Kansas City Royals (from 2021).

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the River Bandits were organized into the High-A Central. In 2022, the High-A Central became known as the Midwest League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

===Franchise monikers===
The Davenport franchise used &quot;Davenport&quot; before changing to &quot;Quad City&quot; in 1962, as other local minor league franchises had folded. The franchise generally used the nickname of its major-league affiliate from 1946 through the 1991 season. This changed in 1992, when the team created its own nickname in a &quot;name the team&#x27; contest. The contest winning name was: &quot;Quad City River Bandits&quot; and from 1992 through the 2003 the team kept this name. On October 20, 2003, the team was renamed the &quot;Swing of the Quad Cities&quot;; after another &quot;name the team&quot; contest was held. However, On December 13, 2007, returned to the &quot;Quad Cities River Bandits&quot; after voters in a third contest chose the River Bandits name over &quot;The Swing&quot; and four other finalists: &quot;Channel Cats&quot;, &quot;The Current&quot;, &quot;River Eagles&quot;, and &quot;Talons.&quot;

The renaming of the Bandits has proven to be one of sports’ most successful re-branding campaigns – merchandise sales after the 2008 re-branding increased more than 400% (and were up an additional 34% in 2009), sponsorship jumped more than 64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team&#x27;s logo one of the top eight in minor league baseball.

===History of franchise ownership===
After success in securing a Midwest League Franchise for Davenport beginning with the 1960 season, the non-profit Quad City Baseball Fans Association continued to operate the franchise from 1960 to 1986. In 1986 Chicago businessman Harry H. Semrow purchased the team from the association for $350,000, but Semrow was forced to sell after the 1987 season due to poor health. 

Richard Holtzman, another Chicago businessman who owned as many as five minor league teams, purchased the franchise from Semrow and remained as owner from 1987 until 1998. In 1998, Holtzman sold the team to Seventh Inning Stretch, a company owned by Kevin Krause, a businessman out of Mason City, Iowa, and son of Kum &amp; Go co-founder William Krause.

On December 28, 2006, Krause agreed to sell the team to Florida-based Main Street Baseball for an undisclosed price; the sale was completed on November 29, 2007.

Under Main Street Baseball&#x27;s ownership, led by Dave Heller and Bob Herrfeldt, the River Bandits sparked a stunning resurgence of baseball in the Quad Cities, winning league championships in 2011 and 2013, setting new attendance records and capturing numerous awards for their innovative promotions.

Since Heller and Herrfeldt took over the Bandits, sponsorship sales, suite sales, ticket sales, and concession sales have all seen annual increases. The team&#x27;s average attendance in its first year under Main Street rose by more than 56%, the largest such increase in baseball, and has climbed to nearly 3,700 fans per game. The Bandits have also led one of sports&#x27; most successful rebranding campaigns – merchandise sales after the 2008 rebranding increased more than 400% (and were up an additional 34% in 2009!), sponsorships jumped more than 64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team&#x27;s logo one of the top eight in minor league baseball.

Main Street Baseball has also been a trail-blazer, having hired the Midwest League&#x27;s only female general manager (Stefanie Brown) then hiring the only African-American GM in minor league baseball. The River Bandits have also consistently had more women in leadership positions than most any team in baseball, and are the only minor league club to have won back-to-back Diversity Economic Impact Engagement (DEIE) Scholarships from major league baseball since MLB started awarding them in 2012.

The River Bandits have been voted Best Family Entertainment by the Quad-City Times for each of the past five years and were recently voted by the River Cities Reader as &quot;The Best Place for An Inexpensive Date that Doesn&#x27;t Look Like It.&quot; The team won the prestigious &quot;Golden Bobblehead&quot; award in 2013 for best charitable promotion in Minor League Baseball for its innovative &quot;Photo Jersey Auction&quot; to benefit Autism Awareness. It also won a &quot;Veeckie Award&quot; from ESPN in 2009 for best minor league promotion (&quot;Tattoo Night&quot;) and the &quot;Promotion of the Year&quot; Award from Ballpark Digest the same year for the team&#x27;s &quot;Mega-Candy Drop&quot;, as well as a Gold Award from the U.S. Army for its community service. The team has also won repeated awards for Heller&#x27;s creative TV and radio ads, which have repeatedly been recognized as among the best in the industry.

==Ballparks==
Early Davenport teams played Sunday games on Sullivan Island outside of town, presumably to avoid Sunday activity laws.

The Davenport teams of 1901–1916, ending with the Davenport Blue Sox, played at Davenport Base Ball Park. It was also called &quot;Blue Sox Stadium&quot;. The ballpark was located at Bowditch &amp; Second Streets, or Third Street &amp; Telegraph Road in Davenport, Iowa.

The Davenport Blue Sox of 1929 and 1930 played at Fairgrounds Park, located within the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds in Davenport, Iowa. the ballpark was also known as &quot;Blue Sox Ball Park.&quot; The ballpark had a capacity of 5,500 (1929). Located at West Locust &amp; North Clark Street, with an address of 2815 West Locust Street Davenport, Iowa. The Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds are still in use today.

Playing at the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds, the city of Davenport realized a stadium was needed. The city preferred a Mississippi River riverfront location near downtown and a lighted stadium. Subsequently, the Davenport Levee Commission proposed a new, lighted, brick stadium along the Davenport riverfront.

On May 26, 1931, the new Municipal Stadium opened. It is still the franchise ballpark today. With a site on the banks of the Mississippi River, the new stadium was constructed entirely with local labor for a total construction cost $165,000. It had light towers (first night game was June 4, 1931) with the grandstand facing the Mississippi River. Municipal Stadium was fondly nicknamed &quot;The Muny.&quot; In 1971, Municipal Stadium was renamed John O&#x27;Donnell Stadium after the longtime sports editor of the &quot;Quad-City Times&quot;. Over time, the ballpark has shown its unique view, versatility and staying power, continuing to host baseball today as Modern Woodmen Park.

Many baseball events have been held at the Stadium through the years. Some of historical note:
* Hosting eight Midwest League All-Star Games in six different decades: 1964, 1968, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1990, 2006 and 2011
* The Davenport Blue Sox had several exhibitions against Negro league teams in the 1930s.
* The Major League St. Louis Browns played the Pittsburgh Pirates in a 1942 exhibition game.

===Modern Woodman Park renovations===
Sitting on the banks of the river, the stadium has survived many floods, including major Mississippi River floods of 1965, 1969, 1993 and 2001, all of which breached the facility. Pictures of the flooded stadium are plentiful in the news media. The Great Flood of 1993 was especially damaging to the facility.

Designed to combat the recurring and costly toll of flooding, a project was undertaken in 2004 to modernize and protect the facility in a joint effort of The River Bandits and the City of Davenport. The result was a massive redesign of the field and grounds at Modern Woodmen Park. The entire structure and field of the original 1931 stadium were redone. Only the exterior facade of the old stadium remained, with concessions, concourses, level loge boxes, and seating areas being reconstructed. The improvements essentially created a new ballpark within the shell of the old park. The resulting 2004 renovations included a raised playing field; a slight shift of the playing field to better face the river; removal of the drive behind the outfield fence; the addition of a berm in the outfield and the addition of exterior brick/metal columns, put in place for decoration and also to hold portable flood walls to be inserted outside the stadium. The new protections secured and protected the facility during other major Mississippi River floods in 2008, 2011 and 2013. Before the 2004 renovations, flooding created financial and logistical problems, as the team was regularly forced to move &quot;home&quot; games to local facilities or other MWL venues such as Clinton, Iowa, North Scott High School, Brady Street Stadium or Black Hawk College.

The ballpark has incorporated modern and creative features. Including a corn field beside left-field, from which the players are introduced. The team unveiled a $347,000 HD video board shortly before the Bandits hosted the 2011 Midwest League All-Star Game. The renamed and remodeled Modern Woodmen Park was selected the Midwest League&#x27;s best ballpark by &quot;Baseball America&quot; and earned a five-star rating from BallparkDigest.com.

In 2007, stadium renaming rights went to Rock Island-based-Modern Woodmen of America for a reported $4.5 million.

Since then, Modern Woodmen Park has earned more accolades than any minor league ballpark in the country. It was voted &quot;the best minor league ballpark in America&quot; by the readers of USA Today and 10Best.com and the Midwest League&#x27;s best ballpark by &quot;Baseball America&quot;. It also earned a 5-star rating from BallparkDigest.com, was named one of the two most beautiful ballparks in minor league baseball by USA Today, one of the top 10 in the nation by Parade Magazine, and was selected &quot;the #2 Coolest Minor League Ballpark in America&quot; by Complex Magazine.

Under Main Street Baseball&#x27;s leadership, the River Bandits have added many fun new features to the ballpark, including a new outfield bar, a new picnic area, five concourse-level &quot;loge boxes&quot;, an long ribbon-board, a huge new 20&#x27; x 36&#x27; tall HD videoboard, a new playground, birthday room, additional office and storage space, a new concessions stand and more than a dozen new portable food carts, a Hall of Fame autographed jersey display, an unmatched collection of bobbleheads from across the country and a sponsored corn field from which the players are introduced at the game&#x27;s outset.

In 2011, the Bandits unveiled their new Budweiser Champions Club, a 2500 s.f. glass-enclosed multi-purpose banquet hall with glass garage doors that open and close depending on the weather. That room has helped increase wedding business by more than 500%, and is regularly sold out during the Christmas season. It was voted by BallparkDigest.com as &quot;the best ballpark renovation under $1 million.&quot;

In 2014, added a tall Ferris Wheel to the landscape of the stadium, with the Ferris Wheel located behind the left-field wall. Also, a tall Drop-N-Twist, an old-fashioned carousel, three bounce houses, and several other amusement rides have been added since then. Also added in 2014 were three new themed areas, including a 1,500 s.f. deck featuring a firepit to keep fans warm during April and May, 51 new swivel-chair seats adjacent to the field, and 18 new extra-wide seats adjacent to the visitor&#x27;s dugout, as well as four new padded seats set aside for veterans and active-duty military.

In 2015, the franchise continued to improve the ballpark with a 10,000 s.f. expansion of the third-base concourse.

<text>Hyatt Hotels Corporation, commonly known as Hyatt Hotels &amp; Resorts, is an American multinational hospitality company headquartered in the Riverside Plaza area of Chicago that manages and franchises luxury and business hotels, resorts, and vacation properties. Hyatt Hotels &amp; Resorts is one of the businesses managed by the Pritzker family. Hyatt has more than 1350 hotels and all-inclusive properties in 69 countries, across South America, North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia 

The Hyatt Corporation came into being upon purchase of the Hyatt House, at Los Angeles International Airport, on September 27, 1957. In 1969, Hyatt began expanding internationally.

Hyatt has expanded its footprint through a number of acquisitions, including the acquisition of AmeriSuites (later rebranded Hyatt Place) in 2004, Summerfield Suites (later rebranded Hyatt House) in 2005, Two Roads Hospitality in 2018, Apple Leisure Group in 2021, Dream Hotel Group in 2023 and Standard International in 2024. 

== History ==
===Foundation and early years===
The first Hyatt House was opened in 1954 by business partners Hyatt Robert von Dehn and Jack Dyer Crouch as a motel near Los Angeles International Airport. In 1957, the hotel was purchased by entrepreneur Jay Pritzker for million. His younger brother, Donald Pritzker, also took on an important role in the company. Considering the growing use of air travel for business, the Pritzker brothers realized that locating a high-quality hotel near a major airport was a valuable business strategy. Within two years, they opened Hyatt House Hotels near San Francisco International Airport and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport.

The company went public in 1962 as Hyatt Corporation. It had two divisions: Hyatt House Hotels and Hyatt Chalet Motels (renamed Hyatt Lodges in 1966).

In 1967, the company opened the Regency Hyatt House in Atlanta, Georgia (today named the Hyatt Regency Atlanta). The futuristic hotel was designed by Atlanta architect John Portman, who would go on to design many other hotels for the chain. It featured a massive indoor atrium, which soon became a distinctive feature of many Hyatt properties.

In 1968, Hyatt International was formed, to operate hotels outside the United States. It would soon become a separate company. In 1969, Hyatt opened its first international hotel, when it was awarded the management contract for the President Hotel in Hong Kong, which was renamed the Hong Kong Hyatt Hotel (later known as the Hyatt Regency Hong Kong).

In 1972, Hyatt formed Elsinore Corporation, a subsidiary to operate the Four Queens Hotel and Casino and the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa &amp; Casino. Donald Pritzker died in 1972 and Jay Pritzker continued to run the company.

Hyatt became a private company in 1979, when the Pritzkers bought the outstanding shares. Elsinore was spun off as a public company. The company opened the Playboy Hotel and Casino as a joint venture with Playboy Enterprises.

Alongside the Hyatt Regency brand, the company introduced the Grand Hyatt brand in 1980, with the opening of the Grand Hyatt New York (now Hyatt Grand Central). That same year, the boutique Park Hyatt brand was also introduced.

The Pritzkers took Hyatt International private as well, in 1982. However, Hyatt and Hyatt International remained two separate companies until June 2004, when substantially all of the hospitality assets owned by the Pritzker family business interests, including Hyatt Corporation and Hyatt International Corporation, were consolidated under a single entity called Global Hyatt Corp. On June 30, 2009, Global Hyatt Corporation changed its name to Hyatt Hotels Corporation.

===Development since the 2000s===
In December 2004, Hyatt Hotels Corporation acquired AmeriSuites, an upscale chain of all-suite business class hotels from affiliates of the Blackstone Group, a New York-based private equity investment firm. Blackstone had inherited AmeriSuites from its 2004 acquisition of Prime Hospitality. The AmeriSuites chain was rebranded and called Hyatt Place, a competitor to the limited-service products Marriott International&#x27;s Courtyard by Marriott and Hilton Worldwide&#x27;s Hilton Garden Inn.

In December 2005, Hyatt acquired limited service company Summerfield Suites from the Blackstone Group. Blackstone had inherited Summerfield Suites from its purchase of Wyndham International. In January 2012, Hyatt Summerfield Suites were rebranded as Hyatt House in 2012 to compete in the &quot;upscale extended stay market&quot; against Residence Inn, Homewood Suites, and Staybridge Suites.

Hyatt launched its first lifestyle brand, Andaz, in April 2007. Hindi for the word &#x27;style&#x27;, Andaz is positioned as a luxury brand, with the first hotel being a rebrand of the Great Eastern Hotel in London, followed by hotels in San Diego, West Hollywood, Shanghai and New York City.

In August 2009, it was reported that Hyatt Hotels Corporation filed plans to raise up to $1.15 billion in an initial share sale. That November Hyatt completed an initial public offering and began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &quot;H.&quot; According to the filing Mark S. Hoplamazian was to serve as CEO and Thomas Pritzker as Executive Chairman. The public offering was a result of the acrimonious breakup of the Pritzker family empire. Accused of looting family trusts, Thomas and cousins Penny and Nicholas took control of the family businesses when they and other family members were sued by cousin Liesel Pritzker, claiming fraud and seeking damages of over US$6 billion.

On September 1, 2011, Hyatt acquired Hotel Sierra, which had 18 properties in 10 states. Along with Hyatt Summerfield Suites hotels, several of these properties were rebranded as Hyatt house in January 2012.

In November 2013, Hyatt introduced their first all-inclusive resort brands, Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara, with the first resorts being opened in Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Los Cabos and Rose Hall, Montego Bay, Jamaica.

On October 28, 2015, Hyatt announced that they were in advanced talks to acquire Starwood Hotels in a cash and stock transaction. The transaction was not completed, and Starwood was acquired by Marriott International instead.

In 2018, Hyatt saw expansion with the acquisition of Two Roads Hospitality. This added the Joie de Vivre, Destination, Alila, and Thompson hotel brands to the Hyatt portfolio, a growth of 85 hotels in 23 markets.

In March 2021, Hyatt announced the official opening of Hyatt&#x27;s 1,000th hotel worldwide, Alila Napa Valley in St. Helena, California.

In August 2021, Hyatt acquired Apple Leisure Group (ALG), a luxury resort-management services, travel and hospitality group, from affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and KSL Capital Partners for $2.7 billion in cash. ALG&#x27;s hotel portfolio consists of over 33,000 rooms operating in 10 countries. The acquisition will extend Hyatt&#x27;s brand footprint into 11 more European markets.

In November 2022, Hyatt acquired Dream Hotels Group, a lifestyle hotel operator for $125 million, with up to an additional $175 million over the next six years as properties come into the pipeline and open. Dream Hotels Group&#x27;s portfolio include 12 managed or franchised lifestyle hotels under four brands.

In April 2023, Hyatt acquired Mr and Mrs Smith, a UK-based platform offering direct booking access to over 1,500 boutique and luxury properties worldwide for £53.0 million in cash consideration.

In June 2024, Hyatt acquired the me and all hotels brand from Lindner Hotels AG, for which Hyatt has entered into a strategic collaboration with in 2022, consisting of six lifestyle hotels and over 1,000 rooms in central city locations across Germany.

In August 2024, Hyatt announced the planned acquisition of Standard International, an upscale boutique hotel operator, for $150 million, with up to an additional $185 million over time as additional properties enter the portfolio. The acquisition consists of 21 open hotels and more than 30 future properties under The Standard, Bunkhouse Hotels, Peri Hotels, The StandardX, and The Manner brands. With the transaction, Hyatt will form a new dedicated lifestyle group, managing all lifestyle brands and operations led by Standard International&#x27;s Executive Chairman Amar Lalvani.

That same month, Hyatt Regency Orlando, one of the region’s largest convention hotels, was sold for $1.02 billion to Los Angeles-based Ares Management and Houston-based Rida Development — the nation&#x27;s highest hotel sale in 2024. The sale of the 1,641-room hotel at 9801 International Drive came to about $622,000 per guest room.

<text>Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Inc. was one of the largest companies that owned, operated, franchised and managed hotels, resorts, spas, residences, and vacation ownership properties. It was acquired by Marriott International in 2016. Starwood was founded in 1969 as a real estate investment trust. In 1995, it was acquired and reorganized by Barry Sternlicht, who was its chairman until 2005 and founder of the Starwood Capital Group. Starwood had 11 brands and owned, managed, or franchised 1,297 properties comprising 370,000 hotel rooms in approximately 100 countries.

==History==

Starwood Hotels and Resorts was originally formed by the real estate investment firm Starwood Capital to take advantage of a tax break; at the time the company was known as Starwood Lodging. Initially, Starwood Lodging owned a number of hotels throughout North America, all under different brand names. The Westin Hotel Company was purchased in 1994 from Aoki Corporation of Japan. Starwood acquired the Sheraton, Four Points by Sheraton, and The Luxury Collection brands from ITT Sheraton in 1998.

In 1999, Starwood launched their &quot;W&quot; Hotels brand. In September 2005, Starwood announced the launch of Aloft, a new hotel brand based on W. Aloft Hotels catered toward business travelers. In 2005, Starwood purchased the Le Méridien brand.

In 2004, Starwood&#x27;s founder and CEO Barry Sternlicht stepped down as CEO to focus his attention on his other firm, Starwood Capital. He remained on the Board of Directors until 2005. He was succeeded as CEO by Steven J. Heyer, and Starwood began selling a number of its company-owned hotels, instead focusing on becoming a management company and franchiser for its current and future hotel brands. In April 2007, Steven J. Heyer left the company on the request of the Board of Directors because of an issue with Heyer&#x27;s management style and after allegations of personal misconduct. Chairman of the Board Bruce Duncan served as interim CEO until September 2007, when the company announced Heyer&#x27;s successor, Frits van Paasschen. Van Paasschen served as CEO until February 2015, when he announced that he was resigning in a mutual decision with the board of directors.

In November 2009, Starwood announced that it would be moving its headquarters from White Plains, New York to Stamford, Connecticut by January 2012.

Starwood had customer contact centers (CCC) in nine locations: Wichita, Kansas; Austin, Texas; Fall River, Massachusetts; St Thomas, Ontario; Cork, Ireland; Singapore; Tokyo, Japan; Guangzhou, China; and Gurgaon, India.

In late May 2014 reports surfaced that the company had recently made a takeover bid for InterContinental Hotels Group worth $10 billion, which neither company confirmed or denied. In November 2015, it was announced that Starwood would be acquired by Marriott International for $12.2 billion. In December 2015, Thomas B. Mangas, former head of Armstrong World Industries&#x27; flooring business, became the CEO at Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide effective December 31, 2015.

On November 30, 2018, Marriott International disclosed that its Starwood brand had been subject to a security breach. After the disclosure, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood announced an investigation into the data breach.

==Brands==
===Westin===
Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts was Starwood&#x27;s largest upscale hotel and resorts brand. It was the oldest brand within Starwood, founded as Western Hotels in 1930, renamed Western International Hotels in 1963, and then Westin Hotels in 1981. The chain was acquired by Starwood in 1997.

===Sheraton===
Sheraton Hotels and Resorts was Starwood&#x27;s flagship brand, providing luxury hotel and resort accommodation. It began operating in 1937 and was sold to Starwood in 1998 by ITT Inc. Also under the Sheraton brand are seven vacation ownership properties.

===The Luxury Collection===

The Luxury Collection brand began on January 13, 1992, when ITC Sheraton designated 28 of its premier hotels and 33 of the Sheraton Towers, the luxury &quot;hotel-within-a-hotel&quot; facilities located within Sheraton&#x27;s largest and most exclusive hotels, as the ITT Sheraton Luxury Collection.

In February 1994, ITT Sheraton acquired a controlling interest in CIGA (Compagnia Italiana Grandi Alberghi, or Italian Grand Hotels Company), an Italian international hotel chain which owned several luxury properties in Europe. The majority of the CIGA hotels were folded into The Luxury Collection. CIGA&#x27;s original logo, the four horses of St. Mark, was kept for The Luxury Collection brand logo until 2010; each Luxury Collection hotel now uses its own logo. After Starwood acquired Sheraton, it established a separate brand identity for The Luxury Collection. Many hotels in The Luxury Collection are smaller establishments in converted palaces or other historically/culturally significant buildings; others are restored historic hotels, such as Hotel Kämp in Helsinki, Finland.

The Royal Penthouse Suite at Hotel President Wilson in Geneva, part of The Luxury Collection, billed at per night, is listed at number 1 on the World&#x27;s 15 Most Expensive Hotel Suites list compiled by CNN in 2012.

===Four Points by Sheraton===
Four Points by Sheraton was launched in April 1995 under the Sheraton Group&#x27;s brand as a set of mid-range hotels that replaced the Sheraton Inn sub-brand of Sheraton.

===W Hotels===
W Hotels was Starwood&#x27;s luxury lifestyle brand, generally marketed towards a younger crowd. It was launched in 1998 with the W New York, a conversion of the old Doral Inn hotel at 541 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan and the brand has since expanded with over 50 hotels and resorts.

Though the hotels vary from newly built flagship properties to more modest conversions of previous hotels, they have a common theme of spare, minimalist modern decor and hip, informal names for categories of rooms and public areas. For example, the lobbies of all the hotels are known as the &quot;Living Room&quot;. W Hotels attempt to include the letter &quot;W&quot; wherever possible - the swimming pool is known as &quot;Wet&quot; and the laundry bag in every room is known as “Wash”. W Hotels are known for the trademarked “Whatever/Whenever” service philosophy and pioneered the now popular “lifestyle” hotels.

===St. Regis===
St. Regis Hotels &amp; Resorts was Starwood&#x27;s main luxury brand, launched in 1899. It is named for St. Regis New York, which was built in 1904 in Manhattan at 5th Avenue and 55th Street by John Jacob Astor IV, who also founded the Astoria Hotel (which later became the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel) and who died in 1912 on the RMS Titanic. In the 1930s, head bartender Fernand Petiot introduced the Bloody Mary cocktail. The St. Regis was a Sheraton from 1966 on, and following a lavish restoration from 1985 to 1991, it was part of the ITT Sheraton Luxury division before it became the cornerstone and flagship of Starwood&#x27;s new brand. The brand is represented on four continents, with a total pipeline of 57 operating and signed hotels as of April 2016.

===Le Méridien===
Le Méridien was founded by Air France in 1972 and was acquired by Starwood in November 2005, by which point it was based in the UK. It has a total of 137 properties operating or in the pipeline worldwide, with its first property being Le Méridien Etoile in Paris. Le Méridien is positioned as an upper-upscale brand in the Starwood hierarchy and offers properties with an edge towards art, design and local destination, with each hotel customized to its respective location with the intent of &quot;unlocking destinations&quot; for guests. Certain locations offer guests complimentary access to art galleries and museums through collaborations and partnerships. Le Méridien has a partnership with the Italian coffee roasting company Illy, serving and promoting Illy-branded coffee and products throughout its hotels around the world.

===Aloft===
Aloft Hotels was launched in 2005 as Aloft, a Vision of W Hotels, in a relationship with W similar to Four Points by Sheraton and its &#x27;brand parent&#x27;, Sheraton. Aloft is a mid-scale, urban-style business/boutique hotel brand.

===Element===
Announced in 2006, and originally known as Element by Westin, Element was Starwood&#x27;s first brand of hotels intended to be environmentally friendly and LEED certified. The designs include energy and water efficient features. The first Element hotel opened in Lexington, Massachusetts, in July 2008. Element hotels are built eco-friendly from the ground up, from the floors made of recycled materials to energy-efficient lighting and plumbing fixtures.

In 2013, the first Canadian location opened in Vaughan, Ontario. In September 2014, the first German location opened in Frankfurt. In 2017, the first South East Asian location opened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

===Tribute Portfolio===
Launched in April 2015, Tribute Portfolio is a collection of independent upscale to upper upscale hotels. As of May 2019, there were 33 Tribute Portfolio hotels operating globally with over 45 hotels in the pipeline.

In April 2018, Marriott began a pilot program offering vacation rentals under the Tribute Portfolio brand. As part of the test, the company partnered with Hostmaker to add 200 homes in London to the service. This pilot ended when Marriott launched Homes &amp; Villas by Marriott International in April 2019.

===Design Hotels===
Design Hotels, based in Berlin, provides hospitality services to a network of nearly 300 independently owned and operated hotels. Starwood was a majority investor in Design Hotels since 2011. In October 2015, Starwood announced that it would add Design Hotels to its brand portfolio. Member hotels of the Design Hotels collection had the option to join the Starwood Preferred Guest loyalty program and gain access to Starwood&#x27;s sales platform.

==Business partnerships and customer programs==
Starwood had a credit card partnership with American Express, which also took over Starwood&#x27;s former partnership with MBNA Canada Bank in Canada in 2010.

The Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) program was merged with Marriott&#x27;s loyalty program on August 18, 2018.

Starwood Preferred Guest also had a partnership with 32 airlines, allowing guests to redeem their points for flights under the &quot;SPG Flights&quot; program. SPG had a &quot;crossover rewards&quot; program with Delta Air Lines, offering Medallion elite members certain elite benefits at Starwood Group hotels and offering certain Medallion elite benefits to SPG Platinum Preferred Guest members.

<doc id="345887" wikidata="Q874784" url="?curid=345887" title="Bar Confederation">
<text>The Bar Confederation (; 1768–1772) was an association of Polish nobles (&quot;szlachta&quot;) formed at the fortress of Bar in Podolia (now Ukraine), in 1768 to defend the internal and external independence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth against Russian political influence and against King Stanislaus II Augustus with Polish reformers, who were attempting to limit the power of the Commonwealth&#x27;s wealthy magnates.

The founders of the Bar Confederation included the magnates Adam Stanisław Krasiński, the bishop of Kamieniec, Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł, Casimir Pulaski, his father and brothers and Michał Hieronim Krasiński. Its creation led to a civil war and contributed to the First Partition of Poland. Maurice Benyovszky was the best known European Bar Confederation volunteer, supported by Roman Catholic France and Austria. Some historians consider the Bar Confederation the first Polish uprising.

== Background ==
=== Abroad ===
At the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), Russia, first allied with Austria and France, had decided to support Prussia, allowing a victory of the Prussians (allied with Great Britain) over the Austrians (allied with France).

On 11 April 1764, a new treaty was signed between Frederick II of Prussia and Catherine II of Russia, choosing Stanislaus Poniatowski (ex-lover of Catherine II) as the future king of Poland after Augustus III&#x27;s death (October 1763).

Neither France nor Austria were able to challenge this candidate and Stanislas was elected in October 1764.

===In the Commonwealth===
Early 18th-century Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had declined from the status of a major European power to that of a Russian satellite state, with the Russian tsar effectively choosing Polish–Lithuanian monarchs during the &quot;free&quot; elections and deciding the direction of much of Poland–Lithuania&#x27;s internal politics, for example during the Repnin Sejm (1767–1768), named after the Russian ambassador who unofficially presided over the proceedings.

During this session, the Polish–Lithuanian parliament was forced to pass resolutions demanded by the Russians. Many of the conservative nobility felt anger at that foreign interference, at the perceived weakness of the government under king Stanislaus Augustus, and at the provisions, particularly the ones that empowered non-Catholics, and at other reforms which they saw as threatening the szlachta&#x27;s Golden Liberty.

The protectorate of Russia over Poland–Lithuania became official with the (&quot;&quot;) which the Repnin Sejm accepted without debate on 27 February 1768.

==Creation of the Bar Confederation (29 February 1768)==
In response to that, and particularly after Russian troops arrested and exiled several vocal opponents (namely bishop of Kyiv Józef Andrzej Załuski, bishop of Cracow Kajetan Sołtyk, and Field Crown Hetman Wacław Rzewuski with his son Seweryn), a group of Polish magnates decided to form a &quot;confederatio&quot; – a military association opposing the government in accordance with Polish constitutional traditions. The articles of the confederation were signed on 29 February 1768 at the fortress of Bar in Podolia.

The instigators of the confederation included Adam Krasiński, Bishop of Kamieniec, his brother Michał Hieronim Krasiński, Casimir Pulaski, Kajetan Sołtyk, Wacław Rzewuski, Michał Jan Pac, Jozef Miaczinsky, Jerzy August Mniszech, Joachim Potocki and Teodor Wessel. Priest Marek Jandołowicz was a notable religious leader, and Michał Wielhorski the Confederation&#x27;s political ideologue.

==Civil war and foreign interventions==
=== 1768 ===
The confederation, encouraged and aided by Roman Catholic France and Austria, declared war on Russia. Its irregular forces, formed from volunteers, magnate militias and deserters from the royal army, soon clashed with the Russian troops and units loyal to the Polish crown. Confederation forces under Michał Jan Pac and Prince Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł roamed the land in every direction, won several engagements with the Russians, and at last, utterly ignoring the King, sent envoys on their own account to the principal European powers, i.e. Ottoman Empire, the major ally of Bar confederation, France and Austria.

King Stanislaus Augustus was at first inclined to mediate between the Confederates and Russia, the latter represented by the Russian envoy to Warsaw, Prince Nikolai Repnin; but finding this impossible, he sent a force against them under Grand Hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki and two generals against the confederates. This marked the Ukrainian campaign, which lasted from April till June 1768, and was ended with the capture of Bar on 20 June. Confederation forces retreated to Moldavia. There was also a pro-Confederation force in Lesser Poland, that operated from June till August, that ended with the royal forces securing Kraków on 22 August, followed by a period of conflict in Belarus (August–October), that ended with the surrender of Nesvizh on 26 October.

The simultaneous outbreak of the Koliivshchyna in Ukraine (May 1768 – June 1769) made major confederation forces retreat to Ottoman Empire beforehand and kept the Confederation alive.

The Confederates appealed for help from abroad and contributed to bringing about war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) that began in September).

=== 1769–1770 ===

The retreat of some Russian forces needed on the Ottoman front bolstered the confederates, who reappeared in force in Lesser and Greater Polands by 1769. In 1770 the Council of Bar Confederation transferred from its original seat in Austrian part of Silesia to Hungary, whence it conducted diplomatic negotiations with France, Austria and Turkey with a view to forming a stable league against Russia. The council proclaimed the king dethroned on 22 October 1770. The court of Versailles sent Charles François Dumouriez to act as an aid to the Confederates, and he helped them to organize their forces. He fortified several fortresses around Kraków (Tyniec, Lanckorona, Częstochowa) and formed a Confederate infantry detachment to protect the warehouses in Podolia.

The Confederates began operating in Lithuania, although after early successes that direction too met with failures, with defeats at Białystok on 16 July and Orzechowo on 13 September 1769. Early 1770 saw the defeats of confederates in Greater Poland, after the battle of Dobra (20 January) and Błonie (12 February), which forced them into a mostly defensive, passive stance.
An attempt of Bar Confederates (including Casimir Pulaski) to kidnap king Stanislaus II Augustus on 3 November 1771 led the Habsburgs to withdraw their support from the confederates, expelling them from their territories. It also gave the three courts another pretext to showcase the &quot;Polish anarchy&quot; and the need for its neighbors to step in and &quot;save&quot; the country and its citizens. The king thereupon reverted to the Russian faction, and for the attempt of kidnapping their king, the Confederation lost much of the support it had in Europe.

=== 1771–1772 ===
Its army, thoroughly reorganized by Dumouriez, maintained the fight. 1771 brought further defeats, with the defeat at Lanckorona on 21 May and Stałowicze at 23 October. The final battle of the war was the siege of Jasna Góra, which fell on 13 August 1772. The regiments of the Bar Confederation, whose executive board had been forced to leave Austria, which previously supported them, after Austria joined the Prusso-Russian alliance, did not lay down their arms.

Many fortresses in their command held out as long as possible; Wawel Castle (defended by Marquis de Choisy) in Kraków fell only on 28 April; Tyniec fortress held until 13 July 1772; Częstochowa, commanded by Casimir Pulaski, held until 18 August. Overall, around 100,000 nobles participated in 500 military clashes in 1768–1772. Perhaps the last stronghold of the confederates was in the monastery in Zagórz, which fell only on 28 November 1772. In the end, the Bar Confederation was defeated, with its members either fleeing abroad or being deported to Siberia, Volga region, Urals by the Russians.

In the meantime, taking advantage of the confusion in the Commonwealth, already by 1769–71, both Austria and Prussia had taken over some of its border territories, with Austria taking Szepes County in 1769–1770 and Prussia incorporating Lauenburg and Bütow. On 19 February 1772, the agreement of partition was signed in Vienna. A previous secret agreement between Prussia and Russia had been made in Saint Petersburg on 6 February 1772. 

Early in August, Russian, Prussian, and Austrian troops fighting the Bar confederation in the Commonwealth occupied the provinces agreed upon among themselves. On 5 August, the three parties issued a manifesto about their respective territorial gains on the Commonwealth&#x27;s expense.

Bar Confederates taken as prisoners by the Russians, together with their families, formed the first major group of Poles and Lithuanians exiled to Siberia (sybirak). It is estimated that about 5,000 former confederates were sent there. Russians organized 3 concentration camps in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth for Polish captives, where these concentrated persons have been waiting for their deportation there.

===International situation after the defeat of Bar confederation and its Ottoman allies===
Around mid-18th century the European balance of power shifted, with Russian victories against the Ottomans in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) strengthening Russia and endangering Habsburg interests in that region (particularly in Moldavia and Wallachia). At that point Habsburg Austria started to consider waging a war against Russia. France, friendly towards both Prussia and Austria, suggested a series of territorial adjustments, in which Austria would be compensated by parts of Prussian Silesia, and Prussia in turn would receive Polish Ermland (Warmia) and parts of the Polish fief, Duchy of Courland and Semigalliaalready under Baltic German hegemony.

King Frederick II of Prussia had no intention of giving up Silesia gained recently in the Silesian Wars. He was interested in finding a peaceful solution – his alliance with Russia would draw him into a potential war with Austria, and the Seven Years&#x27; War had left Austria&#x27;s treasury and army weakened. He was also interested in protecting the weakening Ottoman Empire, which could be advantageously utilized in the event of a Prussian war either with Russia or Austria. Frederick&#x27;s brother, Prince Henry, spent the winter of 1770–71 as a representative of the Prussian court at Saint Petersburg.

As Austria had annexed 13 towns in the Hungarian Szepes county in 1769, violating the Treaty of Lubowla, Catherine II of Russia and her advisor General Ivan Chernyshyov suggested to Henry that Prussia claim some Polish land, such as Ermland. After Henry informed him of the proposal, Frederick suggested a partition of the Polish borderlands by Austria, Prussia, and Russia, with the largest share going to Austria. Thus Frederick attempted to encourage Russia to direct its expansion towards weak and non-functional Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth instead of the Ottomans. 

Russia considered the weak Poland–Lithuania as its protectorate for a few decades already since the Silent Sejm. Poland–Lithuania was devastated by a civil war in which the Bar Confederation&#x27;s forces attempted to disrupt Russian control. The recent Koliivshchyna peasant and Cossack uprising in Ukraine also weakened Polish–Lithuanian position. Further, the Russian-supported king of Poland, Stanislaus Augustus, was seen as both weak and too independent-minded. Eventually the Russian court decided that Poland–Lithuania&#x27;s usefulness as a protectorate had lessened. The three powers officially justified their actions as compensation for dealing with troublesome neighbor and restoring order to Polish anarchy, for which the Bar Confederation provided a convenient excuse. All three were interested in territorial gains.

After Russia occupied the Danubian Principalities, Henry convinced Frederick and Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria that the balance of power would be maintained by a tripartite division of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth instead of Russia taking land from the Ottomans. Under pressure from Prussia, which for a long time wanted to annex the northern Polish province of Royal Prussia, the three powers agreed on the First Partition of Poland–Lithuania. This was in light of the possible Austrian-Ottoman-Bar confederation alliance with only token objections from Austria, which would have instead preferred to receive more Ottoman territories in the Balkans, a region which for a long time had been coveted by the Habsburgs, including Bukovina. The Russians also withdrew from Moldavia and Wallachia away from the Austrian border.

==Legacy==
Until the times of the Bar Confederation, confederates – especially operating with the aid of outside forces – were seen as unpatriotic antagonists. But in 1770s, during the times that the Imperial Russian Army marched through the theoretically independent Commonwealth, and foreign powers forced the Sejm to agree to the First Partition of Poland–Lithuania, the confederates started to create an image of Polish exiled soldiers, the last of those who remained true to their Motherland, an image that would in the next two centuries lead to the creation of Polish Legions and other forces in exile.

The Confederation has generated varying assessments from the historians. All admit its patriotic desire to free the Commonwealth from outside (primarily-Russian) influence. Some, such as Jacek Jędruch, criticise its regressive stance on civil rights issues, primarily with regards to religious tolerance (Jędruch writes of &quot;religious bigotry&quot; and a &quot;narrowly Catholic&quot; stance), and assert that to have contributed to the First Partition. Others, such as Bohdan Urbankowski, applaud it as the first serious national military effort to restore Polish independence.

The Bar Confederation has been described as the first Polish uprising and the last mass movement of szlachta. It is also commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription &quot;&quot;.

<text>Visit Baltimore, formerly the Baltimore Area Convention &amp; Visitors Association (BACVA), is a quasi-public organization started in 1980 by then-Baltimore Mayor William Donald Schaefer. The agency is charged with bringing in tourists and conventions into the city of Baltimore, Maryland, but does not manage the actual convention venues, hotels, or museums in the city.

==History==

In 2004, BACVA launched a totally redesigned website. A major event for BACVA in 2004 occurred in May when it officially opened a totally new Baltimore Visitor Center. This was radically different from the old visitor center, which was inside an antiquated modified construction trailer. The new Baltimore Visitor Center is located next to the Light Street Pavilion of Harborplace and has a unique design. It cost $4.5 million to construct. In its first year of operation (May 7, 2004 – May 7, 2005), the center attracted nearly 390,000 visitors, which exceeded BACVA&#x27;s original estimate of 250,000. Visitors to the center in its first year of operation booked 422 hotel rooms, worth $48,296, and bought 14,942 tickets worth about $223,286.

Inside the Baltimore Visitor Center are racks of brochures with information ranging from Baltimore&#x27;s neighborhoods to major attractions, including the Maryland Science Center, the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Power Plant Live!, and Camden Yards Sports Complex. There is also a 50-seat theater that shows an 11-minute film on Baltimore and Maryland.

In 2005, BACVA made a joint effort with the Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC) to pitch a controversial $305 million, 752-room Hilton Hotel to the Baltimore City Council in an attempt to bring in more conventions to the Baltimore Convention Center. In 2006, BACVA succeeded in its joint effort with the BDC to have a Hilton Hotel built directly adjacent to the Baltimore Convention Center. The hotel officially opened in August 2008 with a direct connection to the Baltimore Convention Center via elevated skybridge crossing Howard Street.

In 2009, BACVA made a decision at its annual meeting to change its name from the Baltimore Area Convention and Visitors Association to Visit Baltimore to make it easier for the public to recognize Baltimore&#x27;s tourism agency and that it followed an industry standard at the time of having tourism agencies have a name that reflect their mission.

The 2005–2008 efforts to bring in more conventions by having the Hilton Baltimore built at a cost of $305 million – the most expensive public works project in city history – were basically a failure and the city is still losing convention business and struggling to find more business. Visit Baltimore is now supporting an estimated $900 million proposal floated by the Greater Baltimore Committee and local businessman and the current owner of the Sheraton Inner Harbor hotel in early 2011 that would build a brand-new 18,500-seat arena to replace the 1st Mariner Arena, a brand-new 500-room hotel to replace the Sheraton and demolish and rebuild the east half of the Baltimore Convention Center as an expansion of the newer, 1996 half. The hotel and arena would be funded by private-sector money while the convention center expansion would be funded by public money; it is unknown what the breakdown of costs will be as that will be determined by a second study to be conducted soon that will continue to see if construction of the entire project is feasible and exactly how much the project would cost the city and state potentially and what the next steps will be.

<doc id="345890" wikidata="Q3100788" url="?curid=345890" title="Gennifer Flowers">
<text>Gennifer Flowers (born January 24, 1950) is an American author, singer, model, actress, former State of Arkansas employee, and former TV journalist. In January 1998, President Bill Clinton testified under oath that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers. 

==Early life==
Flowers has recounted being nicknamed &quot;Buffles&quot; by schoolmates.

==Bill Clinton controversy==

During Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1992 presidential election campaign, Flowers came forward to say that she had had a 12-year extramarital relationship with Clinton, and that he had assisted her in securing a job as an administrative assistant with the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal. The State of Arkansas fired Flowers in early 1992 for failing to show up to work.

After Clinton denied having a relationship with Flowers on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, she held a press conference in which she played tape recordings she had secretly made of phone calls with Clinton. Clinton subsequently apologized publicly to Mario Cuomo for remarks he made about the then-Governor of New York on the tapes, in which he had said that Cuomo acted like a mafioso. During the press conference, Flowers was asked several questions by &quot;Stuttering John&quot; Melendez of the &quot;Howard Stern Show&quot;: if she was planning to sleep with any other candidates before the election, if Clinton used a condom and if there ever was a threesome. She responded by laughing at Stuttering John&#x27;s prank, whereas her advisor wanted to ignore him by trying to answer other questions. News reports at the time speculated that the taped phone conversations between Flowers and Clinton could have been doctored; Flowers had sold the original tapes to &quot;Star&quot; and they were never lab-tested. Clinton aides James Carville and George Stephanopoulos backed the claim the tapes were doctored as well. Stephanopoulos later claimed in a 2000 interview with journalist Tim Russert that &quot;Oh, it was absolutely his voice, but they were selectively edited in a way to – to create some – some impression.&quot;

In December 1996, Flowers talked about her sexual relationship with Clinton on &quot;The Richard Bey Show&quot;. The show was canceled the following day. Bey later attributed a direct connection between the two consecutive events.

In a deposition in January 1998, while denying Kathleen Willey&#x27;s sexual accusations against him, Clinton admitted that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers. In his 2004 autobiography &quot;My Life&quot;, Clinton acknowledged testifying under oath that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers. He stated it was only on one occasion in 1977.

Flowers sued Stephanopoulos, Carville, and others in 1999 for defamation (later amending the suit in 2000 to include Hillary Clinton as a defendant), claiming that they orchestrated a campaign to discredit her. Judicial Watch represented her in her defamation lawsuit against Bill Clinton&#x27;s former aides, Stephanopoulos and Carville. In her case, Flowers argued that the defendants ignored obvious signs that the television news reports did not conclusively determine that someone had interfered with the tapes. Summary judgment dismissing the case was given by a US district court in 2004. The dismissal was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in 2006.

==Post-controversy years==
Flowers published her memoir &quot;Gennifer Flowers: Passion and Betrayal&quot; in 1995. In it, she stated she was a sexual naïf at the time of her alleged relationship with Clinton; &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;&#x27;s book reviewer credited Flowers with breaking the formerly existing taboo regarding the sexual exploits of sitting politicians. The book&#x27;s initial print run was 100,000 copies.

After acting in an Australian film in 1987, she played in another independent Australian film in 1992 and in the same year guest starred in the adult-themed television comedy &quot;Dream On&quot;. She then played herself in &quot;Play It to the Bone&quot; and various TV shows. In 1998, Flowers appeared at Wrestlemania XIV alongside Jeff Jarrett to serve as a guest ring announcer.

Until Hurricane Katrina, she ran a cabaret called the Kelsto Club in a former bordello in New Orleans&#x27; French Quarter. Flowers made her New York theatre debut in 2004, briefly as a replacement in the Off-Broadway hit &quot;Boobs! The Musical&quot;.

As of 2007, she lived in Las Vegas, Nevada, where she occasionally wrote a column. During this time, she was broadly supportive of the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, saying that she wanted to &quot;support my own gender&quot;. Flowers also denied that she had &quot;any interest whatsoever in getting back out there and bashing Hillary Clinton.&quot;

In 2008, she put what she said were the answering machine tapes of her conversations with Clinton up for auction.

In November 2012, Flowers claimed that Clinton contacted her as recently as 2005. During an interview with Susan Roesgen, Flowers alleged to Roesgen that during her prior sojourn in New Orleans, President Clinton telephoned Flowers while visiting the city and asked for a meeting, which Flowers claims that she declined.

In 2016, Flowers tweeted her support for the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, and was scheduled to attend a televised debate between him and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, whom Flowers had supported in 2007. However, the Trump campaign cancelled the invitation after his initial offer.

<doc id="345892" wikidata="Q1141336" url="?curid=345892" title="M&amp;T Bank Stadium">
<text>M&amp;T Bank Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium located in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It has been the home of the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL) since its opening in 1998. The stadium is immediately adjacent to Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the home of the Baltimore Orioles. Often referred to as &quot;Ravens Stadium&quot; or &quot;The Bank&quot;, the stadium has a listed capacity of 70,745 and has been praised for its fan amenities, ease of access, concessions and other facilities.

The stadium was originally known as Ravens Stadium at Camden Yards, until PSINet acquired the naming rights in 1999, naming it PSINet Stadium. It then reverted to Ravens Stadium in 2002 when PSINet filed for bankruptcy. M&amp;T Bank bought the naming rights in 2003 and signed a 15-year, $75 million contract with the Ravens, which was brokered by Team Services, LLC. The naming rights deal for M&amp;T Bank Stadium was renewed for $60M over 10 years in 2014, extending the name through 2027.

==History==
Ground was broken for the new stadium in mid-1996, shortly after the arrival of the Ravens. The team played its first two years at Memorial Stadium. Although there was some sentiment from Baltimore residents in having the Ravens stay there permanently, it was deemed too old to host an NFL team. The Orioles moved away from Memorial Stadium after the 1991 season.

The stadium site was previously the site of the Wm. Knabe &amp; Co. piano factory, which closed during the Great Depression. A sidewalk keyboard mosaic on the southwest corner of the stadium honors the company&#x27;s legacy.

In 2003, M&amp;T Bank acquired naming rights to the stadium. The bank had recently entered the Baltimore market with its purchase of Allfirst Bank. Two other companies were in the running to be granted naming rights to the stadium. They were reportedly Nextel and CarMax. Following the September 2002 death of Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, public sentiment leaned toward renaming the then-sponsorless stadium after the Baltimore icon. The Ravens and the Maryland Stadium Authority held firm in their right to negotiate naming rights fees.

In the end, the plaza in front of the main entrance to the Ravens&#x27; stadium was named &quot;Unitas Plaza&quot;, complete with a bronze statue of the Hall of Famer. Many Ravens fans, as they enter the stadium, will rub the foot of Unitas&#x27; statue as they walk by it. The plaza formerly featured large banners, each containing a picture of Unitas in his playing days, flanking the stadium entrance. After 10 years, these were replaced by large metal 19s (Unitas&#x27; number) for the 2012 season.

In 2014, the Ravens unveiled a new statue of long-time Raven Ray Lewis next to Unitas&#x27; statue. The bronze figure depicts Lewis in the final pose of his iconic &quot;squirrel dance&quot;, which he performed before every Ravens home game upon coming on to the field. Since 2020, the letters &quot;MO&quot; of Baltimore Ravens in the Stadium&#x27;s endzone are painted either gold or white in honor of Baltimore sports icon Mo Gaba.

==Design==

The stadium contains five levels, being the lower bowl, club level, 300 suites level, 400 suites level, and the upper bowl. The lower bowl contains 42 rows of seats, split into two sections. The seats below the tunnel entrances are labeled from 1 to 18, while the seats above the tunnels are labeled from 19 to 42, except in sections 123-130, which contain rows 19-35, due to the press box taking up sideline space.

On the club level, the rows are labeled from 1 to 13 on the sidelines, and 1 to 17 in the corners where no suites are located. In the upper bowl, the sideline seats are labeled from 1 to 32, while in the upper bowl end zones, the rows range from 1 to 26. Seat widths for the lower and upper bowls of the stadium vary from 19 to 21 inches, due to the curve design of the stadium, while the padded club seats range from 21 to 23 inches respectively.

The venue is served by the Stadium/Federal Hill station of the Baltimore Light Rail.

===Playing surface===

The stadium originally featured a natural grass surface. An artificial surface, Sportexe Momentum Turf, was installed for the 2003 season, which in turn was replaced by a new-generation Sportexe Momentum 51 in 2010. In December 2015, the Ravens announced that in 2016 the team would go back to natural grass playing surface, which is currently Tifway 419 Bermudagrass.

==Tenants==

The Ravens are the stadium&#x27;s primary tenant. On December 7, 2008, an M&amp;T Bank Stadium then-record crowd of 71,438 watched the Baltimore Ravens defeat the Washington Redskins 24-10 on &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;, only to be surpassed the next week when the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Ravens 13–9 in front of 71,502. On January 15, 2012, a record crowd of 71,547, the largest in Ravens history, was in attendance at the 2011 Divisional Playoff Game in Baltimore against the Houston Texans, which the Ravens won 20–13.

==Notable events==

===College football===

In 2000, the stadium hosted the Army–Navy Game for the first time and has subsequently hosted the rivalry game in 2007, 2014, and 2016.

In 2005, the stadium was the site of the first rematch in the Maryland–Navy series known as the &quot;Crab Bowl Classic&quot; in 40 years. The two teams played again at M&amp;T Bank Stadium on September 6, 2010 and Maryland won 17–14.

On October 28, 2006, the stadium held a contest between Notre Dame and Navy in which Notre Dame won 38–14. In 2014, the stadium played host to Ohio State–Navy; Ohio State won 34–17.

In 2013, the annual rivalry between Maryland and West Virginia was held at the stadium.

On October 24, 2015, the stadium hosted a Big Ten match-up between Maryland and Penn State in which Penn State won 31–30.

In 2022, Notre Dame and Navy faced off at the stadium once again, with the Fighting Irish winning 35–32.

===High school football===
The Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA) held the four state football championships for Maryland&#x27;s public high schools at M&amp;T Bank Stadium until 2016. Two Baltimore high school football rivalry games have been held at the stadium in November. Baltimore City College used to play Baltimore Polytechnic Institute every November, in one of the oldest high school football rivalries in the United States. Every Thanksgiving, Loyola Blakefield and Calvert Hall College also square off in what has now been called for many years as the Turkey Bowl, usually reaching up to 13,000 people in the audience.

Both games were once played back-to-back on Thanksgiving Day at Memorial Stadium. When City College and Polytechnic joined the MPSSAA before 1994 season, the game was forced to be played in early November, due to MPSSAA rules and playoff schedule.

===Soccer===

On July 24, 2009, English Premier League club Chelsea won 2–1 against Italian Serie A team AC Milan in the first World Football Challenge at M&amp;T Bank Stadium in front of a crowd of 71,203. On July 28, 2012 the stadium hosted a match between Premier League teams Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur before 42,723 fans.

The stadium was a venue for the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, drawing a crowd of 70,450 to watch a quarter finals doubleheader between the United States v. El Salvador, and Honduras v. Costa Rica. The 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup had two quarterfinals games at the stadium: United States v. Cuba and Haiti v. Jamaica, played in front of 37,994 spectators.


===Lacrosse===
The stadium serves as an alternate venue for the Johns Hopkins University men&#x27;s lacrosse team, and was the site of the semifinals and final of the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship in 2003, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2014. Major League Lacrosse&#x27;s Baltimore Bayhawks used the stadium as their home during the 2002 season.

Monster Jam was held at the stadium for the first time in 2011. Monster Jam returned for the third time on June 8, 2013.

It served as Nextel Stadium, the home field for the fictional Washington Sentinels in the 2000 film &quot;The Replacements&quot;. The stadium was supposed to be the location of the football game in the 2002 film &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; and included footage of the presidential motorcade going to the building. The stadium used for the aerial shots is the domed Olympic Stadium in Montreal, while the book used Denver as the locale for the attack.

<doc id="345893" wikidata="Q368254" url="?curid=345893" title="Giacomo Balla">
<text>Giacomo Balla (18 July 1871 – 1 March 1958) was an Italian painter, art teacher and poet best known as a key proponent of Futurism. In his paintings, he depicted light, movement and speed. He was concerned with expressing movement in his works, but unlike other leading futurists he was not interested in machines or violence with his works tending towards the witty and whimsical.

==Biography==
Giacomo Balla was born in Turin, in the Piedmont region of Italy. He was the son of a photographer and as a child studied music.

At age nine, after the death of his father, he gave up music and began working in a lithograph print shop. By age 20, his interest in visual art had developed to such a level that he decided to study painting at local academies, and several of his early works were shown at exhibitions. Following academic studies at the University of Turin, Balla moved to Rome in 1895, where he met and later married Elisa Marcucci. For several years he worked in Rome as an illustrator, caricaturist and portrait painter. In 1899, his work was exhibited at the Venice Biennale, and in the ensuing years, his art was shown at major exhibitions in Rome and Venice, as well as in Munich, Berlin and Düsseldorf, at the Salon d&#x27;Automne in Paris, and at galleries in Rotterdam.
Around 1902, he taught Divisionist techniques to Umberto Boccioni and Gino Severini. Influenced by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Giacomo Balla adopted the Futurism style, creating a pictorial depiction of light, movement and speed. He was a signatory of the Futurist Manifesto in 1910. Typical for his new style of painting is &quot;Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash&quot; (1912) and his 1914 work &quot;Abstract Speed + Sound&quot; (Velocità astratta + rumore). In 1914, he began to design Futurist furniture, as well as so-called Futurist &quot;antineutral&quot; clothing. Balla also began working as a sculptor, creating, in 1915, the well-known work titled &quot;Boccioni&#x27;s Fist&quot;, based on &#x27;lines of force&#x27; (Linee di forza del pugno di Boccioni).

During World War I, Balla&#x27;s studio became a meeting place for young artists.

In 1935, he was made a member of Rome&#x27;s Accademia di San Luca.

In 1955, Balla participated in the documenta 1 in Kassel.

He died on 1 March 1958.

==Notable works==

Balla&#x27;s 1909 painting &quot;The Street Light&quot; typifies his exploration of light, atmosphere, and motion. In this piece, Balla uses a repeating V-pattern with his brushstrokes. These strong and clear brushstrokes are used to portray the energy and brightness coming from the lamp. Additionally, Balla made use of intense colors. These intense colors, white and yellow, start at the lamps center and transition into more cooler tones farther from the bulb of the lamp.

Balla&#x27;s most famous works, such as his 1912 &quot;Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash&quot;, aim to express movement – and thus the passage of time – through the medium of painting. His approach of portraying motion is demonstrated in this work by concurrently displaying various aspects of a moving object. Balla accurately captures the motion of a dog straining to keep up with its owner by painting numerous legs, tails, and leashes. Cubism inspired this fascination with preserving a single instant in an assortment of planes. The approach also pays homage to chronophotography, which was an early method of taking pictures of many stages of movement.

Balla&#x27;s 1912 &quot;The Hand of the Violinist&quot; depicts the frenetic motion of a musician playing, and draws on inspiration from Cubism and the photographic experiments of Marey and Eadweard Muybridge.
In his abstract 1912–1914 series &quot;Iridescent Interpenetration&quot;, Balla attempts to separate the experience of light from the perception of objects as such.

&quot;Abstract Speed + Sound&quot; (1913–14) is a study of speed symbolised by the automobile. Originally, it may have been part of a triptych.

Balla&#x27;s 1914 series &quot;Mercury Passing Before the Sun&quot; depicts the 17 November 1914 transit of Mercury across the face of the Sun. Balla created at least a dozen versions and studies of this work.

Balla was a leading voice in the Futurists movement that involved fashion. His particular designs focused on sharp, forced lines of colour, bold and masculine. Balla designed a peculiar, wrap-around garment with aggressive patterns called ‘force-lines’ in the red, white and green of the Italian flag, complete with a matching tricolour beret. The aim was to turn its wearer into a ‘human flag’ and incite the Italian public to join the side of Germany in pursuit of violent, nationalist politics. 

==Legacy==
In 1987, some of his artworks were exhibited at &quot;documenta 8&quot;, an exhibition of modern art and contemporary art which takes place every five years in Kassel, Germany.

<text>The Externsteine () is a distinctive sandstone rock formation located in the Teutoburg Forest, near the town of Horn-Bad Meinberg in the Lippe district of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
The formation is a tor consisting of several tall, narrow columns of rock which rise abruptly from the surrounding wooded hills. The Hermannsweg, a long-distance hiking trail, passes through the formation.

In a popular tradition going back to an idea proposed to Hermann Hamelmann in 1564, the Externsteine are identified as a sacred site of the pagan Saxons, and the location of the Irminsul idol reportedly destroyed by Charlemagne; there is however no archaeological evidence that would confirm the site&#x27;s use during the relevant period.

The stones were used as the site of a hermitage in the Middle Ages, and by at least the high medieval period were the site of a Christian chapel. The Externsteine relief is a medieval depiction of the Descent from the Cross. It remains controversial whether the site was already used for Christian worship in the 8th to early 10th centuries.

==Name==
The etymology of the name &quot;Extern-&quot; is unclear, in older texts it is written as ”Estern” or Eastern (&quot;-steine&quot; meaning &quot;stones&quot; or &quot;rocks&quot;). The Latinized spelling with &quot;x&quot; is first recorded in the 16th century, but became common only in the late 19th century.

The oldest recorded forms of the name read &quot;Agistersten&quot; and &quot;Eggesterenstein&quot;, both dated 1093.
Other forms of the name include &quot;Egesterenstein&quot; (12th century), &quot;Egestersteyn&quot; (1366), &quot;Egersteyne&quot; (1369), &quot;Egestersten&quot; (1385), &quot;Egesternsteyn&quot; (15th century), &quot;Eygesternsteyn&quot; (151), &quot;Externsteine&quot; (1533), &quot;Egesterennstein&quot; (1583), &quot;Agisterstein&quot; (1592).

Hamelmann (1564) gives the Latinized name &quot;rupes picarum&quot; (&quot;rock of the magpies&quot;), associating the name with Westphalian word &quot;Eckster&quot; &quot;magpie&quot; (Standard German &quot;Elster&quot;).
&quot;Eckster&quot; &quot;magpie&quot; is argued to be the actual etymology of the name by Schröder (1964), who also
connects other Westphalian toponyms &quot;Externbrock, Externmühle, Exter, Extern, Exten an der Exter&quot;.
Other scholars identify the association with magpies as folk etymology; Plassmann (1961) connects the name with a giant &quot;Ecke&quot; or &quot;Ekka&quot; of the &quot;Eckenlied&quot;, a medieval poem of the Theoderic cycle.

Bahlow (1962, 1965) connects the name to the hydronym &quot;Exter&quot;.

More recent linguistic research assigns a much higher probability to a different explanation. The Germanic &quot;ag&quot; means &quot;sharp, edged or pointy&quot;. In Middle Low German &quot;Egge&quot; was used for long rocky ridges. It is found today in &quot;Eggegebirge&quot;, for example, which lies south of the Teutoburg Forest. That latter area was also known as &quot;Osning&quot; (&quot;Osnegge&quot;). Thus, rather than reflecting mythological associations, the physical geology of the stones likely gave rise to their name.

== Geology ==

The Externsteine are located on the northeastern slope of the &quot;Teutoburger Wald&quot;. They are a natural outcropping of sandstone in a region that is otherwise largely devoid of rocks. The formation stretches for several hundred metres. It starts inside the forest with some rocks that are mostly covered by soil. It terminates in a series of 13 highly visible and mostly free-standing pillars. For scientific purposes, these have been numbered I-XIII from northwest to southeast with the most imposing being stones I-V. The largest is rock I (subdivided into Ia and Ib), also known as the &quot;Grottenfels&quot; due to its cave. The next one, II, is also known as &quot;Turmfels&quot; (tower) and rises above the surrounding area. Rock III is called &quot;Treppenfels&quot; (stairs). A large gap separates rocks III and IV. The latter is also known as &quot;Wackelsteinfelsen&quot; due to a loose boulder (now fixed in place) at its top.

The geological formation consists of a hard, erosion-resistant sandstone (so-called &quot;Osningsandstein&quot;), laid down during the early Cretaceous era about 100 million years ago, near the edge of a large shallow sea that covered large parts of Northern Europe at the time. About 70 million years ago, these originally horizontal layers were folded to an almost vertical position. The resulting cracks in the stone offered ample scope for various forms of weathering. Thousands of years of erosion washed the rocks from the surrounding soil and then formed the surface of the stone.

The pillars have been modified and decorated by humans over the centuries. Most of these alterations are on the southwestern side.

The pond that currently lies at the foot of the formation is artificial and was created in the 19th century.

==Description of the human-made structures==

The &quot;Grottenfels&quot; (I) contains a human-made &quot;grotto&quot; of three chambers connected by passages. Above the entrance to the main chamber is a carving that unlike the others here is not a bas-relief, but simply a cut in the stone in the form of what appears to be a winged creature. It appears to have been intended to receive a relief made from some other material and then set into the stone. The main chamber is with a ceiling height of . The side chamber has the same height but is . In the main chamber is an inscription dated to 1115, indicating that an altar was consecrated here. The third room is the so-called &quot;Kuppelgrotte&quot; is reached from the main chamber and via a small passage from the outside. This room is quite narrow compared to the other two and, with its domed ceiling, has a more cavelike appearance. Next to the external entrance, in an alcove, is another relief, much eroded. It shows a standing figure, holding a sash in the left and a key in the right hand. This has been interpreted as a depiction of St Peter.

The outside of rock I also features the &quot;Kreuzabnahmerelief&quot; (showing Christ&#x27;s Descent from the Cross).

Below the side chamber, next to the pond, is the so-called &quot;Sargstein&quot; (tomb stone). An arched alcove with an open stone sarcophagus at the bottom has been cut into the sandstone. This is a type of structure known as an Arcosolium. On top of this rock is a platform reached by an uneven stairway.

The top of rock Ia has been turned into a platform and is reached by a stone stairway that begins between rocks I and II. A rectangular chamber has been cut into the peak of rock II, known as the &quot;Höhenkammer&quot; (high chamber). It can be reached by a stair in rock III and a wooden construction linking rocks II and III. The platform seems to have been reduced from its original size by rockfalls. The chamber shows signs of wooden pegs that likely once supported wooden walls and/or a wooden ceiling. At the east of the &quot;Höhenkammer&quot; is an apse with a circular window and an altar. Towards the west is an alcove with columns carved into the rock. To the north there are pilasters and arched windows. The northwestern end is marked by the carving of a bearded man (likely dating from the Renaissance or Baroque). Remains indicate the past presence of further stairways on the rock.

Finally, rock IV has been decorated with the coat of arms of the Counts of Lippe.

== History ==
===Prehistory===
Archaeological excavations have yielded some Upper Paleolithic stone tools dating to about 10,700 BC from 9,600 BC. Beneath a rock overhang on rock VIII, microliths from the Ahrensburg culture such as arrow heads or blades were found. Evidence of fire sites was also found. The area was thus frequented by nomadic groups who used the stones as a temporary shelter.

The site is associated with archaeoastronomical speculation; a circular hole above the &quot;altar stone&quot; in the &quot;Höhenkammer&quot; has been identified in this context as facing in the direction of sunrise at the time of summer solstice.

However, no archaeological evidence has been found that would substantiate use of the site between the end of the Upper Paleolithic and the Carolingian period (9th century). In the 1990s, artefacts found in the excavation conducted by in 1934/35 were analyzed. Attribution of objects found was either to the Mesolithic Ahrensburg culture (see above) or to the medieval period, with evidence of occupation in the Bronze or Iron Age conspicuously absent: All the ceramic and metal items found were younger than the Carolingian period, some stone artefacts were attributed to the Ahrensburg culture.

===Middle Ages===
Archaeological excavations at the site in the 1930s produced evidence for use from the late 10th to the 15th centuries. In addition, a drystone wall east of rock II (not extant today) could be linked to buildings here mentioned in medieval documents. Some additional records still exist today in photographs, but they can not be put into context due to the loss of written materials in World War II. Thermoluminescence dating in the caves support the findings. In the main and side chamber, the last large fires were used in the 14th or 15th century (one as early as the 11/12th century). In the &quot;Kuppelgrotte&quot; these tests have shown the last large fire to have burned in the 10th century. One (highly uncertain) result possibly even pointed to the 8th century (actual result: 735 with a margin of error of +/- 180 years).

However, the first mention of the stones is in a document dated to around 1129, which refers to a farm &quot;Holzhausen or Egesterenstein&quot;. The abbot of Werden Abbey, which owned the farm, had been passing through and was housed there. It is possible that mass was celebrated at the Externsteine at that point. A potential earlier mention occurs in a document dated 1093, but this is only extant in two copies from 1374 and 1380. It records the purchase of a farm at Holzhausen including an &quot;Agisterstein&quot; by the abbot of the (abbey) at Paderborn from a female Saxon noble called Ida. This is deemed plausible by historians since in the 16th century the abbey still had a farmstead at Holzhausen. However, the inscription in the main chamber of the grotto mentions a consecration in 1115 by &quot;Henrico&quot;, which is deemed to be a reference to , bishop of Paderborn from 1084 to 1127. This implies a contradiction, since either the abbot or the bishop would be in charge of any local place of worship. Historians have suggested, though, that this may be an indication that the abbey did not in fact claim the Externsteine for itself thus leaving them to fall into the bishop&#x27;s purview.

Some authors have argued that the ecclesial carvings and alterations to the stones may suggest use of the site as a Christian sanctuary from the early 9th century. In particular, the Externsteine relief has been the subject of debate among art historians, formerly widely accepted as of Carolingian origin (9th century), scholarly consensus has placed it in the 12th century since the 1950s. From a stylistic point of view, historians today place the relief in the period 1160 to 1170. Even assuming a high medieval date, the relief represents the oldest monumental relief worked into a natural rock face found north of the Alps.

In the early 13th century, temporal control of the area passed from the abbey to the House of Lippe. From 1366, the ecclesial control of Abdinghof over a chapel at the Externsteine is well documented. This lasted into the 17th century. It involved a hermitage at this location, with individuals named as hermits in 1385 and 1469. The document from 1385 also mentions an &quot;Upper Altar&quot;, likely referring to the altar in the &quot;Höhenkammer&quot;.

There remains a contradiction between the use of the Externsteine as a simple roadhouse for travellers and as an hermitage on the one hand and the presence of the monumental relief and the Arcosolium on the other. These may indeed have been a reconstruction of the Holy Sepulchre. The remains visible today indicate the possibility that the Externsteine were intended as a destination for pilgrims unable to travel to Jerusalem. To that end many medieval churches created . However, it is unclear who could have built it here and why there is no written evidence of such a relatively elaborate undertaking.

===Early modern period===
The site was within the County of Lippe, formerly a county within the Duchy of Saxony, which gained imperial immediacy by 1413, throughout the Early modern period. The hermitage apparently became a hideout for bandits and in the early 16th century was dissolved by the rulers. This was roughly at the time that the Reformation was introduced in Lippe (1538) and church activity at the site ceased.

The original claims associating the Externsteine with Saxon pagan worship were made by Hermann Hamelmann, who in his &quot;Delineatio Oppidorum Westfaliae&quot; (1564) claimed to take the information from older authorities (which cannot now be recovered or identified),
:&quot;Horne ... ex vicina rupe picarum, antiquo monumento, cuius veteres scriptores mentionem fecerunt, claret. Legi aliquando, quod ex rupe illa picarum, idolo gentilitio, fecerit Carolus magnus altare sacratum et ornatum effigiebus apostolorum&quot;
:&quot;Horn is famous for the &quot;rock of the magpies&quot;, an ancient monument mentioned by older writers. I have read that Charlemagne from this rock of the magpies, then a pagan idol, made a consecrated altar decorated with images of the apostles.&quot;

Around 1592, the Count&#x27;s local forest warden lived in the caves. Circa 1660, Herman Adolph, Count of Lippe designed the area for use as a hunting lodge and &quot;Lustschloss&quot;. This was a fortress of two squat round towers flanking a central gatehouse, built against the eastern side of the Externsteine. The excavated foundations show relatively thin walls, indicating that these walls were never intended as fortifications but were just ornamental. A stairwell next to rock I gave access to a viewing platform on top. Likely associated with this era is the bearded figure on the platform and the coat of arms inserted into rock IV.

===18th and 19th centuries===

The structure was rarely used, and fell into dilapidation in the 18th century. In 1810, it was torn down at the request of Countess Pauline.

The old long-distance trade road running between rocks III and IV was expanded and paved in 1813. The unstable &quot;Wackelstein&quot; was secured with iron hooks. At the same time, new stairs were constructed and a bridge between rocks II and III gave access to the &quot;Höhenkammer&quot;.

These improvements and better access via the road made the Externsteine an increasingly popular tourist destination, continuing a trend of the 18th century. Half-timbered 17th century buildings were replaced by new buildings, including several hotels.

The Wiembecke stream flowing past the stones was dammed to form an artificial pond in 1836. The pond was later drained for the excavations of 1934/5, and restored after 1945.

The period of Romantic nationalism of the 1860s to 1870s inspired a large number of publications speculating about the ancient history of the site. Many of these were contributed by local amateur historians and published in the &quot;Zeitschrift für vaterländische Geschichte und Althertumskunde Westfalens&quot;. The contributions by Wilhelm Engelbert Giefers (1817–1880) were reprinted as a short monograph in 1867.
Local amateur historian Gotthilf August Benjamin Schierenberg (1808–1894) seems to have been the first to identify the &quot;pagan idol&quot; mentioned by Hamelmann with the Saxon Irminsul.

The first archaeological excavations were performed in 1881 and 1888, with limited results. Gustav Schierenberg was looking in vain for evidence of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 1881. In 1888, the &quot;Westfälischer Altertumsverein&quot; under Konrad Mertens was looking at the possible reconstruction of the Holy Sepulchre.

===20th century===
From 1912 to 1953, a tramway ran along the Externsteine road, operated by &quot;Paderborner Elektrizitätswerke und Straßenbahn AG&quot; (PESAG). A stop was located right next to the stones.

With the introduction of a road numbering system in 1932, the road passing between the stones became part of &quot;Fernverkehrsstraße Nr. 1&quot; (Aachen–Königsberg). The course of the road was relocated to the south-east in order to protect the stones in 1936. This is now &quot;Bundesstraße 1&quot;.

In 1926, the Externsteine were declared &quot;one of the oldest and most important nature reserves in Lippe&quot; and were placed under protection. Today the preserve measures approximately , and forms part of the &quot;‘Teutoburg Forest’&quot; nature reserve, Externsteine.

Wilhelm Teudt was particularly interested in the Externsteine, which he suggested was the location of a central Saxon shrine, the location of Irminsul and an ancient sun observatory. Since the mid-1920s he had popularized them by calling them the &quot;Germanic Stonehenge&quot;.
Teudt popularized the identification of the site as that of the Saxon Irminsul destroyed by Charlemagne. Teudt could refer to a total number of more than 40 publications on the Externsteine, including eleven substantial monographs, most of which he considered outdated. In 1932, the area was excavated (for the third time) by but no &quot;cultural remains&quot; were discovered.

During the period of Nazi rule, the Externsteine became a focus of nationalistic propaganda. In 1933, the &quot;Externsteine Foundation&quot; was established and Heinrich Himmler became its president. Interest in the location was furthered by the &quot;Ahnenerbe&quot; division within the SS, who studied the stones for their value to Germanic folklore and history.

After the Nazis came to power, Teudt was put in charge of additional excavations at the site and appointed to head the work done there by the &quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot; in 1934/35. Teudt thought that the Externsteine had served as an observatory until its destruction by Charlemagne. He initiated the demolishing of tourist infrastructure (tramway, hotels) and the creation of a &quot;sacred grove&quot; or &quot;Heiligtum&quot; nearby. The SS used Serbian prisoners of war for the project.

Since the 1950s, the Externsteine were developed into a popular tourist attraction. The section of the tramway line connecting to the Externsteine was closed in 1953. In 1958, visitor numbers were around 224,000 people annually.

==Today==
Today, between a half to one million people annually visit the stones, making the Externsteine one of the most frequently visited nature reserves in Westphalia. The site also remains of interest to various Neo-Pagans and nationalist movements.

Because of its reputation as &quot;pagan sacred site&quot; in popular culture, there have often been private gatherings or celebrations on the day of summer solstice and Walpurgis Night. The trend had been visible since the 1980s, but the growing number of visitors came to be seen as a problem in the late 2000s, with more than 3,500 on the site. The municipalities of the Lippe (&quot;Landesverband Lippe&quot;) reacted by prohibiting camping, alcohol consumption and open fires on the site in 2010 and closed the parking at the site. A spokesman emphasized that the decision was not directed against &quot;esotericists, druids and dowsers&quot;, but against large-scale parties of binge-drinkers.

Since 2006 the Externsteine site has been a &quot;&quot; (national geotope).

<text>Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art is a 1993 non-fiction work of comics by American cartoonist Scott McCloud. It explores formal aspects of comics, the historical development of the medium, its fundamental vocabulary, and various ways in which these elements have been used. It expounds theoretical ideas about comics as an art form and medium of communication, and is itself written in comic book form.

&quot;Understanding Comics&quot; received praise from notable comic and graphic novel authors such as Art Spiegelman, Will Eisner, Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, and Garry Trudeau (who reviewed the book for &quot;The New York Times&quot;). Although the book has prompted debate over many of McCloud&#x27;s conclusions, its discussions of &quot;iconic&quot; art and the concept of &quot;closure&quot; between panels have become common reference points in discussions of the medium.

The title of &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; is an homage to Marshall McLuhan&#x27;s seminal 1964 work &quot;Understanding Media&quot;.

== Publication history ==
Excerpts from &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; were published in &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; #200 (Apr. 1992); that issue later won the 1992 Don Thompson Award for Best Non-Fiction Work. McCloud previewed the book at the August 1992 Comics Arts Conference.

&quot;Understanding Comics&quot; was first published by Tundra Publishing; reprintings have been released by Kitchen Sink Press, DC Comics&#x27; Paradox Press, DC&#x27;s Vertigo line, and HarperPerennial. The book was edited by Mark Martin, with lettering by Bob Lappan.

=== Sequels ===
McCloud has followed up &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; with &quot;Reinventing Comics&quot; (2000), in which he suggested ways for the medium to change and grow; and &quot;Making Comics&quot; (2006), a study of methods of constructing comics.

== Summary ==
&quot;Understanding Comics&quot; is a wide-ranging exploration of the definition, history, vocabulary, and methods of the medium of comics. An attempt to formalize the study of comics, it is itself in comics form.

The book&#x27;s overarching argument is that comics are defined by the primacy of sequences of images. McCloud also introduced the concept of &quot;closure&quot; to refer to a reader&#x27;s role in closing narrative gaps between comics panels. The book argues that comics employ nonlinear narratives because they rely on the reader&#x27;s choices and interactions.

The book begins with a discussion of the concept of visual literacy and a history of narrative in visual media. McCloud mentions, among other early works of graphic narrative, the Bayeux Tapestry, as an antecedent to comics. &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; posits Swiss caricaturist Rodolphe Töpffer as in many ways &quot;the father of the modern comic&quot;. McCloud emphasizes Töpffer&#x27;s use of &quot;cartooning and panel borders&quot; along with &quot;the first interdependent combination of words and pictures seen in Europe&quot;.

McCloud also highlights the differences between iconic and realistic figures. Iconic figures can be compared to a standard cartoon, while realistic figures focus more on photo-quality in terms of detail. He states that Western culture is captivated by iconic images more so due to their simplicity. He provides a full comparison and breakdown of iconic and realistic images and gives an interesting explanation of his reasoning behind this statement.

One of the book&#x27;s key concepts is that of &quot;masking&quot;, a visual style, dramatic convention, and literary technique described in the chapter on realism. It is the use of simplistic, archetypal, narrative characters, even if juxtaposed with detailed, photographic, verisimilar, spectacular backgrounds. This may function, McCloud infers, as a mask, a form of projective identification. His explanation is that a familiar and minimally detailed character allows for a stronger emotional connection and for viewers to identify more easily.

One of the book&#x27;s concepts is &quot;The Big Triangle&quot;, a tool for thinking about different styles of comics art. McCloud places the realistic representation in the bottom left corner, with iconic representation, or cartoony art, in the bottom right, and a third identifier, abstraction of image, at the apex of the triangle. This allows placement and grouping of artists by triangulation.

==Awards and honors==
&quot;Understanding Comics&quot; won multiple Harvey Awards in 1994 for Best Graphic Album/Original Material and Best Biographical, Historical or Journalistic Presentation. In addition, McCloud won the 1994 Harvey Award for Best Writer. 

&quot;Understanding Comics&quot; won the 1994 Eisner Award for Best Comics-Related Book.

Author McCloud won the 1994 Adamson Award for Best International Comic-Strip [or comic book] Cartoonist. The book was a finalist for the 1994 Hugo Award for Best Non-Fiction Book.

The Swedish translation of the book, &quot;Serier: Den Osynliga Konsten&quot;, published in 1995 by Häftad, was awarded the 1996 Urhunden Prize.

The French translation of the book, titled &quot;L&#x27;Art invisible&quot; and published by Vertige Graphic, won the Prix Bloody Mary at the 2000 Angoulême International Comics Festival. In addition, it was nominated for that year&#x27;s Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Best Album.

==Legacy==
Along with Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;Comics and Sequential Art&quot;, &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; is considered to form the foundations for formal comics studies in English.

The book was called &quot;one of the most insightful books about designing graphic user interfaces ever written&quot; by Apple Macintosh co-creator Andy Hertzfeld.

== Parodies ==
&quot;Understanding Comics&quot; was parodied by Dylan Sisson in his &quot;Filibusting Comics: The Next Chapter&quot;, published by Fantagraphics in 1995, and later translated into Spanish.

It was parodied again, in Tim Heiderich and Mike Rosen&#x27;s &quot;Misunderstanding Comics&quot;, self-published via Kickstarter in 2012.

<doc id="345907" wikidata="Q558247" url="?curid=345907" title="Yakub Beg of Yettishar">
<text>Muhammad Yakub Beg (30 May 1877), later known as Yakub Padishah, was the Kokandi ruler of Yettishar (Kashgaria), a state he established in Xinjiang from 1865 to 1877. He was recognized as Emir of Yettishar by the Ottoman Empire and held the title of &quot;Champion Father of the Faithful&quot;.

==Spelling variants==
In English-language literature, the name Yakub Beg has also been spelt as Yaqub Beg, Yakoob Beg or Yaʿqūb Beg. Authors using Russian sources have also used the spelling Yakub-bek. A few publications in English written by Chinese authors transcribe his name as &quot;Āgǔbó&quot;, which is the pinyin transcription his name in Chinese, , a shortened form of .

The first name, Muhammad, is subject to the usual variations in spelling. &quot;Yaʿqūb&quot; is an Arabic analogue of Jacob, and &quot;Beg&quot; is a Turkic noble title. His noble title &quot;Beg&quot; was later elevated to &quot;Padishah&quot; after his rise to power. He was also given the title &quot;Atalıq Ghazi&quot; () by the Emir of Bukhara in 1866, and the Ottoman Sultan granted him the title of Emir.

==Background==
Beg&#x27;s ethnic background is uncertain. According to his biographer D. C. Boulger, Beg was a Tajik and a descendant of Timur. However, this claim is self-contradictory: as a Tajik, Beg would have had to have a link on his mother&#x27;s side in order to be considered Timur&#x27;s offspring, but Timur was actually a Turco-Mongol from the Barlas tribe. Korean historian Hodong Kim suggests the claim of descent from Timur was an unsupported fabrication intended to glorify Beg&#x27;s genealogy by ascribing his descent to both Timur and Genghis Khan.

According to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Yakub Beg was ethnically a Tajik. British surveyor Thomas George Montgomerie stated that, although he was a Tajik whose native tongue was Tajiki Neo-Persian, he rarely spoke anything but the local Turkic dialect once his rule over Kashgaria began.

Beg&#x27;s forefathers had lived in the mountainous part of Karategin before moving to Dehbid, near Samarkand. Beg&#x27;s father, Pur Muhhammad, was born in Samarkand and completed his education in Khojent, later working as a qadi (a judge) at Piskent. He married a local qadi as his second wife. She gave birth to his son Yakub Beg in 1820.

==Life==
===Early life===
Yakub Beg was born in the town of Pskent, in the Khanate of Kokand (now in Uzbekistan). At a young age, he was orphaned, and was thereafter raised by his uncle.

===Career===
Beg&#x27;s lax lifestyle worried his uncle who sent him to Tashkent to become a weaver. However, Beg quickly became bored and returned to Piskent where he obtained a minor job under the general Ghadai Bai.

He later worked under the governor of Khojent, Muhhammad Karim Khaska. When Aziz Bacha was appointed as the governor of Tashkent, Muhhammad Karim Khaska was transferred to the Khanate of Kokand along with Beg, but Kashka was soon assassinated by Musulman Quli. This juncture caused Beg to seek service in cavalry under Bacha. Kilauchi&#x27;s governor Nar Muhhammad married Beg&#x27;s sister around this time. In 1847, Nar Muhhammad succeeded Kashka as governor of Tashkent, and Beg was appointed as Beg of Chinaz. Around 1849, he was transferred and appointed as commander of Ak-Mechet, primarily owing to his brother-in-law&#x27;s influence. Beg soon amassed a large fortune. He was involved in the complex factional shifts of the Khanate of Kokand. The internal rivalry between Musalman Quli who was the &quot;Mingbashi&quot; at the time and Nar Muhhammad led to a clash in 1852 where Quli fled, and one of Nar&#x27;s allies Utambai became Mingbashi. Beg was subsequently recalled back to Tashkent where he was promoted to the rank of military officer with the title of &quot;Baturbashi&quot;.

===Qipchaq massacre===
In late 1852, Muhammad Khudayar Khan, taking advantage of the disunity between the nomadic Qipchaqs and wishing to end their interference in the politics of the Khanate, attempted a coup. The rival Qipchaqs, Nar Muhhammad and Quli, were both captured and executed. According to Vladimir Nalivkin, Beg conspired against the Nar and allied himself with Khudayar, however the veracity of this claim is doubtful. Many Qipchaqs were massacred, and this led to an end of the domination of the Qipchaqs over Khokand. There is some uncertainty as to the whereabouts of Beg between 1852 and 1864. In 1864, however, he helped defend Tashkent during the first Russian attack.

==Invasion of Xinjiang==

===Initial conquest ===
As a result of the Dungan Revolt (1862–77), by 1864, the Chinese held only the citadels of Kashgar and a few other places. The Kyrgyz, or Kazakh Sadic Beg, entered Kashgar but were unable to take the citadel and were sent to Tashkent as a Khoja to become ruler. Burzug Khan, the only surviving son of Jahangir Khoja, left Tashkent with six men. He joined Yakub Beg, left Kokand with 68 men, and crossed the border of China in January 1865. Sadic Beg, defeated by Yakub Beg, was driven beyond the mountains. Yakub went southeast to Yarkand, the largest town in the region, and was driven out by an army from Kucha. He next besieged the Chinese at Yangi Hissar for 40 days and massacred the garrison. Sadic Beg reappeared, was defeated, and talked into becoming an ally. Invaders from Badakshan were also talked into an alliance. A Dungan force from Kucha and eastward arrived at Maralbeshi and was defeated with 1,000 of the Dungans joining Yakub Beg. Yarkand had decided to submit to Burzug Khan and his great vizier. In September 1865, the second in command and 3,000 men surrendered, converted to Islam, and joined Yakub Beg. The commander refused and blew himself up along with his family; the commanders of Yarkand and Kulja had done the same. An army of rebels from Kokand arrived and joined Yakub. Later in the year, Burzug Khan and Yakub went to Yarkand to deal with a disturbance. The Dungan faction suborned Yakub&#x27;s Dungans and he was reduced to a few hundred men. Burzug drew off to a separate camp, Yakub defeated the Dungans, Burzug Khan fled to Kashgar and declared Yakub a traitor. The religious leaders supported Yakub, and Burzug was seized in his palace. He was confined for 18 months, exiled to Tibet, and later found his way to Kokand. In little more than a year, Yakub had become master of Kashgar, Yarkand, and Maralbashi, areas stretching roughly from the western end of the Tarim Basin to as far as the Yarkand River.

The Tarim Basin was conquered by Beg, who was viewed as a Khoqandi foreigner and not as a local.

===Later reign===
The Khan of Kokand had some claim over Barzug Khan as a subject, but did nothing in practice. Yakub entered into relations and signed treaties with the Russian Empire and Great Britain, but failed in trying to get their support for his invasion.

====Popularity====
Yakub Beg&#x27;s rule was unpopular among the natives, with one of the local Kashgaris, a warrior and a chieftain&#x27;s son, commenting: &quot;During the Chinese rule there was everything; there is nothing now.&quot; Trade also declined. Yakub was disliked by his Turkic Muslim subjects, burdening them with heavy taxes and subjecting them to a harsh interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.

Korean historian Kim Hodong points out the fact that his disastrous and inexact commands failed the locals and they, in turn, welcomed the return of Chinese troops. Qing dynasty general Zuo Zongtang wrote that &quot;The Andijanis are tyrannical to their people; government troops should comfort them with benevolence. The Andijanis are greedy in extorting from the people; government troops should rectify this by being generous.&quot;
==Death==

His precise manner of death is unclear. &quot;The Times&quot; of London and the Russian &quot;&quot; both reported that he had died after a short illness. Historian Musa Sayrami stated that he was poisoned on 30 May 1877, in Korla by the former hakim (local city ruler) of Yarkand, Niyaz Hakim Beg, as part of a conspiracy with Qing Dynasty forces in Jungaria. However, in a letter to the Qing authorities, Niyaz denied any involvement in the death of Yakub, claiming that the Kashgarian ruler had committed suicide. Other sources also state that he was killed in battle with the Chinese.

While contemporaneous Muslim writers usually explained Yakub Beg&#x27;s death by poisoning, and the suicide theory was the accepted truth among the Qing generals of the time, modern historians, according to Kim Hodong, think that natural death (of a stroke) is the most plausible explanation.

The exact date of Yakub&#x27;s death is uncertain. Although Sayrami claimed that he died on 28 April 1877, modern historians think that this is impossible, as Nikolay Przhevalsky met him on 9 May. Chinese sources usually give 22 May as the date of his death, while Aleksey Kuropatkin thought it to be 29 May. Late May 1877 is therefore thought to be the most likely time. Official sources from the US State Department and activists involved in the incident state that Yakub&#x27;s sons and grandson had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment with a fund provided for their support.

==Legacy==

Rebiya Kadeer praised Yakub Beg.

===Tributes===
A son of general and politician Yulbars Khan was named after Yakub Beg.

====In media====
Yakub makes an appearance in the second half of George Macdonald Fraser&#x27;s novel &quot;Flashman at the Charge&quot;.
===Al Qaeda===
Al-Qaeda ideologue Mustafa Setmariam Nasar praised Yakub and his establishment of educational institutions for Islam, and mosques called him &quot;Attalik Ghazi&quot; and a &quot;good man&quot; for his war against Buddhists and the Chinese.

The &quot;Doğu Türkistan Haber Ajansı&quot; (East Turkestan News Agency) published an article from Al-Qaeda branch Al-Nusra Front&#x27;s English language &quot;Al-Risalah&quot; magazine (مجلة الرسالة), second issue (العدد الثاني), translated from English into Turkish and titled Al Risale: &quot;Türkistan Dağları&quot; 2. Bölüm (The Message: &quot;Turkistan Mountains&quot; Part 2), which praised the Sharia implemented by Yakub and cited him as an upholder of Jihad, attacking the Qing.

<doc id="345914" wikidata="Q4969947" url="?curid=345914" title="British European Airways Flight 548">
<text>British European Airways Flight 548 was a scheduled passenger flight from London Heathrow to Brussels that crashed near Staines, England, United Kingdom, shortly after take-off on 18 June 1972, killing all 118 people on board. The accident became known as the Staines air disaster. , it remains the deadliest air accident (as opposed to terrorist incidents) in British aviation history and was the deadliest air accident involving a Hawker Siddeley Trident. 
Initially, there were two survivors of the accident: a man who was discovered in the aircraft cabin and a young girl. Both died at the scene.

The aircraft suffered a deep stall in the third minute of its flight and crashed to the ground, narrowly missing a busy main road. The public inquiry principally blamed the captain for failing to maintain airspeed and configure the high-lift devices correctly. It also cited the captain&#x27;s undiagnosed heart condition and the limited experience of the co-pilot while noting an unspecified &quot;technical problem&quot; that the crew apparently resolved before take-off.

The crash took place against the background of an impending pilots&#x27; strike that had strained relations between crew members. The strike had also disrupted services, causing Flight 548 to be loaded with the maximum weight allowable. Recommendations from the inquiry led to the mandatory installation of cockpit voice recorders (CVR) in British-registered airliners. Another recommendation was for greater caution before allowing off-duty crew members to occupy flight deck seats. Some observers felt that the inquiry was unduly biased in favour of the aircraft&#x27;s manufacturers.

==Industrial relations background==
On Monday 19 June 1972, the day following the accident, the International Federation of Air Line Pilots&#x27; Associations (IFALPA) had declared, as a worldwide protest, a strike action against aircraft hijacking, which had become commonplace in the early 1970s. Support was expected, but the British Air Line Pilots Association (BALPA) organised a postal ballot to ask members at British European Airways (BEA) whether they wanted to join the strike. Because of the impending strike, travellers had amended their plans to avoid disruption, and as a result Flight 548 was full despite Sunday being traditionally a day of light travel.

BALPA was also in an industrial dispute with BEA over pay and conditions. The dispute was controversial, those in favour being mainly younger pilots and those against mostly older. A group of twenty-two BEA Trident co-pilots known as supervisory first officers (SFOs) were already on strike, citing their low status and high workload. To help train newly qualified co-pilots, SFOs were told to occupy only the third flight-deck seat of the Trident as a &quot;P3&quot;, operating the aircraft&#x27;s systems and helping the captain (known as &quot;P1&quot; on the BEA Trident fleet) and the co-pilot (&quot;P2&quot;) who handled the aircraft. In other airlines and aircraft, the job of SFO/P3 was usually performed by flight engineers. As a result of being limited to the P3 role, BEA Trident SFOs/P3s were denied experience of aircraft handling, which led to loss of pay, which they resented. In addition, their status led to a regular anomaly: experienced SFO/P3s could only assist while less-experienced co-pilots actually flew the aircraft.

===Captain Key&#x27;s outburst===

Tensions came to a head shortly before the accident. Three days earlier, on 15 June, a captain complained that his inexperienced co-pilot &quot;would be useless in an emergency.&quot; Upset, the co-pilot committed a serious error on departure from London Heathrow, setting the high-lift devices fully down instead of up. The mistake was noted and remedied by the SFO, who related the event to colleagues as an example of avoidable danger. This became known among BEA pilots as the &quot;Dublin Incident.&quot;

An hour and a half before the departure of Flight 548, its rostered captain, Stanley Key, a former Royal Air Force pilot who had served during the Second World War, was involved in a quarrel in the crew room at Heathrow&#x27;s Queens Building with a first officer named Flavell. The subject was the threatened strike, which Flavell supported and Key opposed. Both of Key&#x27;s flight deck crew on Flight 548 witnessed the altercation, and another bystander described Key&#x27;s outburst as &quot;the most violent argument he had ever heard.&quot; Shortly afterward, Key apologised to Flavell and the matter seemed closed. 

Key&#x27;s anti-strike views had won enemies, and graffiti against him had appeared on the flight decks of BEA Tridents, including the incident aircraft, G-ARPI (&quot;Papa India&quot;). The graffiti on &quot;Papa India&quot;″s flight engineers&#x27; desk was analysed by a handwriting expert to identify who had written it, but this could not be determined. The public inquiry found that none of the graffiti had been written by crew members on Flight 548 on the day of the accident.

==Operational background==
The aircraft operating Flight 548 was a Hawker Siddeley Trident Series 1 short- to medium-range three-engined airliner. This particular Trident (s/n 2109) was one of twenty-four de Havilland D.H.121s (the name &quot;Trident&quot; was not introduced until September 1960) ordered by BEA in 1959 and was registered to the corporation in 1961 as By the time of &quot;Papa India&quot;″s first flight on 14 April 1964, de Havilland had lost their separate identity under Hawker Siddeley Aviation, and the aircraft was delivered to BEA on 2 May 1964. The Trident I was equipped with three interconnected high-lift devices on each wing leading edge—two leading-edge droop flaps outboard and a Krueger flap on the section closest to the fuselage.
While technically advanced, the Trident (and other aircraft with a T-tail arrangement) had potentially dangerous stalling characteristics. If its airspeed was insufficient, and particularly if its high-lift devices were not extended at the low speeds typical of climbing away after take-off or of approaching to land, it could enter a deep stall (or &quot;superstall&quot;) condition in which the tail control surfaces become ineffective (as they are in the turbulence zone of the stalled main wing) from which recovery was practically impossible.

The danger first came to light in a near-crash during a 1962 test flight, when de Havilland pilots Peter Bugge and Ron Clear were testing the Trident&#x27;s stalling characteristics by pitching its nose progressively higher, thus reducing its airspeed. The Trident entered a deep stall after a critical angle of attack was reached. Eventually, it entered a flat spin and appeared to be about to crash, but a wing dropped during the stall, and when corrected with rudder the other wing dropped. The aircraft continued rolling left and right until the nose pitched down and the crew were able to recover to normal flight. The incident resulted in the Trident being fitted with an automatic stall warning system known as a &quot;stick shaker&quot; and a stall recovery system known as a &quot;stick pusher,&quot; which automatically pitched the aircraft down to build up speed if the crew failed to respond to the warning.

These systems were the subject of a comprehensive stall programme, involving some 3,500 stalls being performed by Hawker Siddeley before the matter was considered resolved by the Air Registration Board. The stall warning and recovery systems tended to over-react: of ten activations between the Trident entering service and June 1972, only half were genuine, although in the previous years there had been no false activations when an aircraft was in the air. When BEA Trident pilots were questioned informally by one captain, over half of the pilots said that they would disable the protection systems on activation rather than let them recover the aircraft to a safe attitude. Random checks carried out by BEA after the accident showed that this was not the case; twenty-one captains stated that they had witnessed their co-pilots react correctly to any stall warnings.

===Felthorpe accident===

The Trident&#x27;s potential to enter a deep stall was highlighted in the crash of Trident 1C &quot;G-ARPY&quot; on 3 June 1966 near Felthorpe, Norfolk, during a test flight, with the loss of all four pilots on board. In this accident, the crew had deliberately switched off both the stick shaker and stick pusher as required by the stall test schedule, and the probable cause was determined to be the crew&#x27;s failure to take timely positive recovery action to counter an impending stall. The Confidential Human Factors Incident Reporting Programme (CHIRP), an experimental, voluntary, anonymous and informal system of reporting hazardous air events introduced within BEA in the late 1960s (and later adopted by the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Aviation Administration), brought to light two near-accidents, the &quot;Orly&quot; and &quot;Naples&quot; incidents: these involved flight crew error in the first case and suspicion of the Trident&#x27;s control layout in the second case.

===Orly (Paris) incident===
In December 1968, the captain of a Trident 1C departing Orly Airport for London tried to improve climb performance by retracting the flaps shortly after take-off. This was a non-standard procedure, and shortly afterward he also retracted the leading-edge droops. This configuration of high-lift devices at a low airspeed would have resulted in a deep stall, but the co-pilot noticed the error, increased airspeed and re-extended the droops, and the flight continued normally. The event became known as the &quot;Paris Incident&quot; or the &quot;Orly Incident&quot; among BEA staff.

===Naples incident===

In the second near-accident, a Trident 2E (G-AVFH) climbing away from London Heathrow for Naples in May 1970 experienced what was claimed by its flight crew to have been a spontaneous uncommanded retraction of the leading-edge slats which was initially unnoticed by any of them. The aircraft&#x27;s automatic systems sensed the loss of airspeed and lift and issued two stall warnings. Since the crew did not initially detect anything amiss, they disabled the automatic system. While doing so, the co-pilot noticed and immediately remedied the problem by re-extending the retracted slats, and the flight continued normally.

Investigations into this incident found no mechanical malfunction that could have caused the premature leading-edge device retraction, and stated that the aircraft had &quot;just about managed to stay flying.&quot; A possible design fault in the high-lift control interlocks came under suspicion, although this was discounted during the investigation into the crash of Flight 548. The event became known as the &quot;Naples Incident&quot; or the &quot;Foxtrot Hotel Incident&quot; (after the registration of the aircraft concerned) within BEA and was examined during the accident inquiry. The forward fuselage of this aircraft involved in the &quot;Naples Incident&quot; is preserved and on public display at the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre, London Colney.

===Previous ground accident involving G-ARPI===

An accident affecting G-ARPI had occurred on 3 July 1968. Due to a control failure, an Airspeed Ambassador freight aircraft (G-AMAD) deviated from the runway on landing at Heathrow and struck G-ARPI and its neighbouring sister aircraft, G-ARPT, while they were parked unoccupied near Terminal 1, resulting in six fatalities from the freighter&#x27;s eight occupants. G-ARPT was cut in two and damaged beyond economic repair; G-ARPI lost its tail fin, which was repaired at a cost of £750,000 (£ million today). G-ARPI performed satisfactorily thereafter, and the incident is thought to have had no bearing on its subsequent crash.

G-ARPI later suffered some minor undercarriage damage as a result of skidding off the runway at Basel during a cross-wind landing on 4 February 1970.

==Crew and passengers==

The crew on the day of the accident comprised Captain Stanley Key as P1, Second Officer Jeremy Keighley as P2 and Second Officer Simon Ticehurst as P3. Key was aged 51 and had 15,000 flying hours experience, including 4,000 on Tridents. Keighley was aged 22 and had joined line flying a month and a half earlier, with 29 hours as P2. Ticehurst was aged 24 and had over 1,400 hours, including 750 hours on Tridents. The cabin crew consisted of Senior Steward Frederick Farey, Steward Alan Lamb and Stewardess Jennifer Mowat (the youngest crew member on the flight, at age 19).

Among the passengers were 29 Americans, 29 Belgians, 28 Britons, 12 Irish, four South Africans and three Canadians. There was also one passenger from each of French West Africa, India, Jamaica, Latin America, Nigeria and Thailand. The passengers included between twenty-five and thirty women and several children.

===Departure===


The flight crew boarded BE 548 (call sign &quot;Bealine 548&quot;) at 15:20 to prepare for a 15:45 departure.

At 15:36, flight dispatcher J. Coleman presented the load sheet to Key, whose request for engine start clearance was granted three minutes later. As the doors were about to close, Coleman asked Key to accommodate a BEA flight crew that had to collect a Merchantman aircraft from Brussels. The additional weight of the three crew members necessitated the removal of a quantity of mail and freight from the Trident to ensure its total weight did not exceed the permitted maximum of . This was exceeded by , but as there had been considerable fuel burnoff between startup and takeoff, the total aircraft weight (including fuel) was within the maximum permitted take-off weight.

The &quot;deadheading&quot; crew was led by Captain John Collins, an experienced former Trident first officer, who was allocated the observer&#x27;s seat on the flight deck. One seat, occupied by a baby, was freed by the mother holding it in her arms.

The doors closed at 15:58 and at 16:00 Key requested pushback. At 16:03 Flight 548 was cleared to taxi to the holding point adjacent to the start of Runway 28 Right. During taxi, at 16:06 the flight received its departure route clearance: a routing known as the &quot;Dover One Standard Instrument Departure&quot;. This standard instrument departure involved taking-off to the west over the instrument landing system localiser and middle marker beacon of the reciprocal Runway 10 Left, turning left to intercept the 145° bearing to the Epsom non-directional beacon (NDB) (to be passed at or more), and then proceeding to Dover. Key advised the tower that he was ready for take-off and was cleared to do so. He subsequently reported an unspecified technical problem and remained at the holding point for two minutes to resolve it.

At 16:08 Key again requested and received take-off clearance. A cross wind was blowing from 210° at . Conditions were turbulent, with driving rain and a low cloud base of ; broken cloud was also reported at , and the official report says that the crew would have been without any visual reference at &quot;crucial times&quot; during the flight. At 16:08:30 Flight 548 began its take-off run, which lasted forty-four seconds, the aircraft leaving the ground at an indicated airspeed (IAS) of . The safe climb speed (V2) of was reached quickly, and the undercarriage was retracted. After nineteen seconds in the air the autopilot was engaged at and ; the autopilot&#x27;s airspeed lock was engaged even though the actual required initial climb speed was .

At 16:09:44 (seventy-four seconds after the start of the take-off run), passing , Key began the turn towards the Epsom NDB and reported that he was climbing as cleared and the flight entered cloud. At 16:10 (ninety seconds), Key commenced a standard noise abatement procedure which involved reducing engine power. As part of this, at 16:10:03 (ninety-three seconds) he retracted the flaps from their take-off setting of 20°. Shortly afterwards, Flight 548 reported passing above ground level and was re-cleared to climb to . During the turn, the airspeed decreased to , below the target speed.

===Stall warnings===
At 16:10:24 (114 seconds), the leading-edge devices were selected to be retracted at a height above the ground of and a speed of , below the safe droop flap retraction speed of . One second afterwards, visual and audible warnings of a stall activated on the flight deck, followed at 16:10:26 (116 seconds) by a stick shake and at 16:10:27 (117 seconds) by a stick push which disconnected the autopilot, in turn activating a loud autopilot disconnect warning horn that continued to sound for the remainder of the flight. Key levelled the wings but held the aircraft&#x27;s nose up, which kept the angle of attack high, further approaching a stall.

By 16:10:32 (122 seconds), the leading-edge devices had stowed fully into the wing. The speed was , and height above the ground was , with the aircraft still held into its usual climb attitude. Key continued to hold the nose-up attitude when there was a second stick shake and stick push in the following two seconds. A third stick push followed 127 seconds into the flight but no recovery was attempted. One second later, the stall warning and recovery system was over-ridden by a flight crew member.

At 16:10:39 (129 seconds), the aircraft had descended to and accelerated to as a result of the stall recovery system having pitched the aircraft&#x27;s nose down to increase airspeed. &quot;G-ARPI&quot; was in a 16° banked turn to the left, still on course to intercept its assigned route. Key pulled the nose up once more to reduce airspeed slightly, to the normal &#x27;droops extended&#x27; climb speed of , which further stalled the aircraft.

At 16:10:43 (133 seconds), the Trident entered a deep stall. It was descending through , its nose was pitched up by 31°, and its airspeed had fallen below the minimum indication of . At 16:10:47 (137 seconds) and , the Trident was descending at . Impact with the ground came at 16:11, 150 seconds after brake release.
The aircraft just cleared high-tension overhead power lines and came to rest on a narrow strip of land surrounded by tall trees immediately south of the A30 road, and a short distance south of the King George VI Reservoir near Staines-upon-Thames. A fire broke out during the rescue effort when a cutting apparatus was used.

===Eyewitnesses and rescue operations===
There were three eyewitnesses; brothers Paul and Trevor Burke, aged 9 and 13, who were walking nearby, and a motorist who called at a house to telephone the airport.

Air traffic controllers had not noticed the plane&#x27;s disappearance from radar. Emergency services only became aware of the accident after fifteen minutes and did not know the circumstances for nearly an hour. First on the scene was a nurse living nearby, who had been alerted by the boys, and an ambulance crew that happened to be driving past. A male passenger who had survived the accident was discovered in the aircraft cabin, but died soon after arrival at Ashford Hospital without recovering consciousness. A young girl was also found alive but died at the scene; there were no other survivors. Altogether, 30 ambulances and 25 fire engines attended the accident.

Drivers formed heavy traffic jams and were described by Minister of Aerospace Michael Heseltine on BBC Television that evening as &quot;ghouls, unfortunate ghouls&quot;. Reports that the public impeded rescue services were dismissed during the inquiry. In addition, some witnesses claimed the traffic jams were the result of the recovery and rescue, during which the police closed the A30 road.

A BEA captain, Eric Pritchard, arrived soon after the bodies had been removed; he noted the condition of the wreckage and drew conclusions:

The accident was the worst air disaster in the United Kingdom until the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. The crash was the first in the United Kingdom involving the loss of more than 100 lives.

==Investigation and public inquiry==
On Monday 19 June 1972 Michael Heseltine, Minister for Aerospace told the House of Commons that he had directed a Court of Inquiry, an &quot;ad hoc&quot; tribunal popularly called a &quot;public inquiry&quot;, to investigate and report on the accident. Public inquiries bypassed the usual British practice whereby the Accidents Investigation Branch (AIB) investigated and reported on air crashes, and were held only in cases of acute public interest. On 14 July, the High Court Judge Sir Geoffrey Lane was appointed to preside over the inquiry as Commissioner.

The British aviation community was wary of public inquiries for several reasons. In such inquiries, AIB inspectors were on an equal footing with all other parties, and the ultimate reports were not drafted by them, but by the Commissioner and his or her Assessors. Proceedings were often adversarial, with counsel for victims&#x27; families regularly attempting to secure positions for future litigation, and deadlines were frequently imposed on investigators. Pressure of work caused by the Lane Inquiry was blamed for the death of a senior AIB inspector who committed suicide during the inquiry.

===AIB investigation and coroner&#x27;s inquest===
The aircraft&#x27;s two flight data recorders were removed for immediate examination, and investigations at the site of the accident were completed within a week. The wreckage of &quot;Papa India&quot; was then moved to a hangar at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough, Hampshire, for partial re-assembly aimed at checking the integrity of its flight control systems. An inquest was held into the 118 deaths, opening on 27 June 1972.

A pathologist stated that Captain Key had an existing heart condition, atherosclerosis, and had suffered a potentially distressing arterial event caused by raised blood pressure typical of stress, an event which was often interpreted by the public as a heart attack.
It had taken place &quot;not more than two hours before the death and not less than about a minute&quot; according to the pathologist&#x27;s opinion given as evidence during the public inquiry. In other words, Key could have suffered it at any time between the row in the Queens Building crewroom and ninety seconds after the start of the take-off run (the instant of commencing noise abatement procedures). The pathologist could not specify the degree of discomfort or incapacitation which Key might have felt. Key&#x27;s medical state continued to be the subject of &quot;conflicting views of medical experts&quot; throughout the inquiry and beyond.

===Lane Inquiry===
The public inquiry, known as the &quot;Lane Inquiry&quot;, opened at the Piccadilly Hotel in London on 20 November 1972, and continued until 25 January 1973, with a break over Christmas, despite expectations that it would end sooner. It was opened by Geoffrey Wilkinson of the AIB with a description of the accident, and counsel for the relatives of the crew members and passengers then presented the results of their private investigations. In particular, Lee Kreindler of the New York City Bar presented claims and arguments that were considered tendentious and inadmissible by pilots and press reporters. They involved hypotheses about the mental state of Captain Key, conjecture about his physical state (Kreindler highlighted disagreements between US and British cardiologists) and allegations about BEA management. The allegations were delivered using tactics considered as &quot;bordering on the unethical&quot;.

The inquiry also conducted field inspections, flew in real Tridents and &quot;flew&quot; the BEA Trident simulator as well as observing the Hawker Siddeley Trident control systems rig. Its members visited the reassembled wreckage of &quot;G-ARPI&quot; at Farnborough and were followed by the press throughout their movements. The bare facts being more-or-less uncovered soon after the event, the inquiry was frustrated by the lack of a cockpit voice recorder fitted to the accident aircraft.

The stall warning and stall recovery systems were at the centre of the inquiry, which examined in some detail their operation and why the flight crew might have over-ridden them. A three-way air pressure valve (part of the stall recovery system) was found to have been one sixth of a turn out of position, and the locking wire which secured it was missing. Calculations carried out by Hawker Siddeley determined that if the valve had been in this position during the flight then the reduction in engine power for the noise abatement procedure could have activated the warning light that indicated low air pressure in the system. The failure indications might have appeared just prior to take-off and could have accounted for the two-minute delay at the end of the runway. A captain who had flown &quot;Papa India&quot; on the morning of the accident flight noted no technical problems, and the public inquiry found that the position of the valve had no significant effect on the system.

====Findings and recommendations====
The Lane Report was published on 14 April 1973. Speaking in the House of Commons, Heseltine paid tribute to the work done by Mr Justice Lane, Sir Morien Morgan and Captain Jessop for the work they had carried out during the inquiry into the accident.

The inquiry&#x27;s findings as to the main causes of the accident, were that:
* The captain failed to maintain the recommended airspeed.
* The leading-edge devices were retracted prematurely.
* The crew failed to monitor airspeed and aircraft configuration.
* The crew failed to recognise the reasons for the stall warnings and stall recovery system operation.
* The crew wrongly disabled the stall recovery system.

Underlying causes of the accident were also identified:
* That Captain Key was suffering from a heart condition.
* The presence of Captain Collins on the flight deck might have been a distraction.
* The lack of crew training on how to manage pilot incapacitation.
* The low flying-experience level of Second Officer Keighley.
* Apparent crew unawareness regarding the effects of an aircraft configuration change.
* Crew unawareness regarding the stall protection systems and the cause of the event.
* The absence of a baulk mechanism to prevent droop retraction at too low an airspeed.

Recommendations included an urgent call for cockpit voice recorders and for closer co-operation between the Civil Aviation Authority and British airlines. Although the report covered the state of industrial relations at BEA, no mention was made of it in its conclusions, despite the feelings of observers that it intruded directly and comprehensively onto the aircraft&#x27;s flight deck. BEA ceased to exist as a separate entity in 1974, when it and the British Overseas Airways Corporation merged to form British Airways. A recommendation of the report that all British-registered civil passenger-carrying aircraft of more than all-up weight should be equipped with cockpit voice recorders resulted in their fitting becoming mandatory on larger British-registered airliners from 1973.

One issue treated as secondary at the inquiry was the presence in the flight deck observer&#x27;s seat of Captain Collins. The Lane report recommended greater caution in allowing off-duty flight crew members to occupy flight deck seats, and aired speculation that Collins might have been distracting his colleagues. The report noted that Collins&#x27; body was found to be holding a can of aerosol air freshener in its right hand. Sources close to the events of the time suggest that Collins played an altogether more positive role by attempting to lower the leading-edge devices in the final seconds of the flight; Eric Pritchard, a Trident captain who happened to be the first airman at the accident site, recalled that a fireman had stated that Collins was lying across the centre pedestal and noted himself that his earphones had fallen into the right-hand-side footwell of the flight deck, diagonally across from the observer&#x27;s seat, as might be expected if he had attempted to intervene as a last resort.

There were protests at the conduct of the inquiry by BALPA (which likened it to &quot;a lawyers&#x27; picnic&quot;), and by the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators which condemned the rules of evidence adopted and the adversarial nature of the proceedings. Observers also pointed to an unduly-favourable disposition by the inquiry to Hawker Siddeley, manufacturer of the Trident, and to the makers of the aircraft&#x27;s systems. Debate about the inquiry continued throughout 1973 and beyond.

The accident led to a much greater emphasis on crew resource management training, a system of flight deck safety awareness that remains in use today.

==Victims and memorials==


All 118 persons aboard the aircraft were killed: 112 passengers and six crew members. Among the passengers were twelve senior businessmen from Ireland, including the head of the Confederation of Irish Industry, who were en route to Brussels for meetings preparatory to Irish accession to the European Economic Community.
A group of sixteen doctors and senior staff from the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital were also on board, and two memorial benches to them were placed close to the hospital in Queen Square. 

Former CIA official Carmel Offie, who had been dismissed for homosexuality, considered to be a security risk factor at the time, was also on board.

Two memorials to all the victims were dedicated on 18 June 2004 in the town of Staines. The first is a stained-glass window in St Mary&#x27;s Church where an annual memorial service is held on 18 June. The second is a garden near the end of Waters Drive in the Moormede Estate, close to the accident site. On 18 June 2022, the fiftieth anniversary, there was a memorial service attended by relatives of those who died, members of the emergency services, the Lord Lieutenant of Surrey, the local MP, and the chairman of British Airways.

==In popular culture==
*The story of the accident was featured on the thirteenth season of the Canadian television show &quot;Mayday&quot; in an episode entitled &quot;Fight to the Death&quot; (known as &quot;Air Disasters&quot; in the US, and as &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot; in the UK and the rest of the world). 
*The story was also featured in an episode of &quot;Air Crash Confidential&quot; produced by World Media Rights. It was partially filmed at the FAST Museum, Farnborough, UK using the cockpit of a Trident 3 (&quot;G-AWZI&quot;).
