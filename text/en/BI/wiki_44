<text>Hunters &amp; Collectors are an Australian rock band from Melbourne, formed in 1981. Fronted by founding member, singer-songwriter and guitarist Mark Seymour, the band&#x27;s other mainstays are John Archer on bass guitar and Doug Falconer on drums and percussion. Soon after forming they were joined by Jack Howard on trumpet and keyboards, Jeremy Smith on French horn, guitars and keyboards, and Michael Waters on trombone and keyboards. Also acknowledged as a founder was audio engineer and art designer Robert Miles. Joining in 1988, Barry Palmer, on lead guitar, remained until they disbanded in 1998. The group reformed in 2013 with the 1998 line-up.

Originally influenced by krautrock and the productions of Conny Plank, Hunters &amp; Collectors&#x27; early music featured abrasive percussion, noisy guitar, and driving bass lines, producing a tribal post-punk sound exemplified by their debut single, &quot;Talking to a Stranger&quot; (1982). Hunters &amp; Collectors recruited Plank to produce two of their early albums, &quot;The Fireman&#x27;s Curse&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Jaws of Life&quot; (1984); neither charted into the Top 50 of the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Their first Top 10 album, &quot;Human Frailty&quot; (1986), saw the band begin to shift towards a more polished, anthemic pub rock sound.

Later Top 10 studio albums were &quot;Ghost Nation&quot; (1989), &quot;Cut&quot; (1992), and &quot;Demon Flower&quot; (1994). Their hit singles were &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot; (1984), &quot;Say Goodbye&quot; (1986), &quot;When the River Runs Dry&quot; (1989), &quot;True Tears of Joy&quot; (1992), and &quot;Holy Grail&quot; (1993). They became one of the most popular live acts in Australia and according to musicologist Ian McFarlane, their &quot;great achievement was to lay bare human emotions in the intensely ritualistic milieu of the pub-rock gig&quot;.

==History==
===1978–1980: Formation===
Hunters &amp; Collectors&#x27; founding mainstays are John Archer (bass guitar), Doug Falconer (drums) and Mark Seymour (guitar and lead vocals). They met as residential students of Ormond College at the University of Melbourne in the late 1970s. Seymour is the older brother of Nick Seymour, the bass guitarist for Crowded House. In 1978 with Robert Miles (sound engineer) Archer, Falconer and Seymour formed a casual band, The Schnorts (named after a Belgian tennis racket). They played cover versions of 1960s songs, including &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot;. Their lead singer, Margot O&#x27;Neill, was a journalist on radio 3RRR program, &quot;Talking Headlines&quot;.

A more ambitious band, The Jetsonnes, followed in September 1979, with the addition of Ray Tosti-Gueira on guitar and backing vocals. According to music journalist, Clinton Walker, The Jetsonnes had a &quot;clever post-punk pop sound&quot; which &quot;was lighter, bouncier (rather than funkier) and more infectious than other like-minded bands&quot;. Their only released track is &quot;Newspaper&quot; which was one side of a gig give away split single in June 1980 with &quot;Miniskirts in Moscow&quot; by fellow pop group, International Exiles, as the other. By September that year The Jetsonnes had disbanded but Archer, Falconer, Miles, Seymour and Tosti-Gueira decided to continue with new members, Geoff Crosby on keyboards and Greg Perano (ex-True Wheels) on percussion to form a new band.

===1981–1983: &quot;World of Stone&quot; to &quot;The Fireman&#x27;s Curse&quot;===

Hunters &amp; Collectors formed in Melbourne in early 1981 with the initial line-up of Archer, Crosby, Falconer, Miles, Perano, Seymour and Tosti-Gueira. Miles was credited as an equal part of the band&#x27;s output and stayed throughout their main career. Perano provided the band&#x27;s name from &quot;Hunters and Collectors&quot;, a track on 1975&#x27;s &quot;Landed&quot; album by German group Can. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, compared the new band with The Jetsonnes and found it to be &quot;a far more radical and unremitting concept&quot;. Hunters &amp; Collectors played live for the first time on 15 May 1981 at the Crystal Ballroom in St Kilda, as part of a medical fundraiser for American musician Snakefinger.

Originally Hunters &amp; Collectors were influenced by the Krautrock genre and the productions of Conny Plank, featuring strong percussive influences, noisy guitar, and driving bass lines. As lead singer and guitarist, Seymour became the principal lyricist and the linchpin of the group. The core of Hunters &amp; Collectors was expanded by a horn section, later dubbed Horns of Contempt, consisting of Nigel Crocker and Michael Waters both on trombone; Jack Howard, Andy Lynn and Chris Malherbe each on trumpet; and Jeremy Smith on French horn.

Mushroom Records specifically formed a new alternative label, White Label Records, when they signed Hunters &amp; Collectors. Their first release was &quot;World of Stone&quot;, a three-track 12&quot; extended play in January 1982. It reached the top 50 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. Their debut self-titled album followed in July and was produced by the band and engineered by Sydney-based Tony Cohen. It peaked at No. 21 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart, and No. 14 on the New Zealand Albums Chart. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Talking to a Stranger&quot;, also released in July, was accompanied by a music video directed by film maker Richard Lowenstein, but it did not enter the Top 50. By that time, Tosti-Gueira was replaced by Martin Lubran (ex-Spiny Norman) on guitar and the Horns of Contempt were reduced to three: Howard, Smith and Waters.

Another EP, &quot;Payload&quot;, was released in November, its four tracks were co-produced by Mike Howlett (ex-Gong) and the band. The EP peaked at No. 31 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. Lowenstein also directed the music video for the lead single, &quot;Lumps of Lead&quot;, but it did not chart in Australia or New Zealand. In 1983 the band toured the United Kingdom for six months and signed with Virgin Records. The label recompiled three tracks from the Australian version of &quot;Hunters &amp; Collectors&quot; and all four tracks from &quot;Payload&quot; into the international version of &quot;Hunters &amp; Collectors&quot;, which was released in April. While in the UK and attempting to enter the local market, the group&#x27;s members &quot;were doing odd jobs, illegally, to keep afloat and getting steadily more miserable in the process&quot;.

By mid-year the band had decamped to Conny&#x27;s Studio in Germany, where they recorded their second album, &quot;The Fireman&#x27;s Curse&quot;, co-produced by Plank (Can, Cluster, Kraftwerk), with Dave Hutchins engineering, and released by White Label and Virgin Records on 5 September 1983. McFarlane felt it was &quot;overly ambitious and cluttered, and generally suffered from a lack of fresh ideas&quot;. The album did not reach the top 50 in Australia but did so in New Zealand. A three-record deal with Virgin was broken when band members insulted the label&#x27;s executive, Simon Draper, by telling him that he was &quot;a little blueblood&quot; with no faith in them. Its lead single, &quot;Judas Sheep&quot; (August), reached the top 40 in New Zealand but did not chart in Australia. After November&#x27;s single, &quot;Sway&quot;, failed to chart in both markets, they disbanded briefly.

===1984–1986: &quot;The Jaws of Life&quot; to &quot;Human Frailty&quot; ===
Late in 1983, Hunters &amp; Collectors had briefly disbanded, but soon reformed without Lubran and Perano. Seymour explained to &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;″ Neil Lade why the group had reconvened &quot;[we] have something valuable to offer the Australian music scene&quot;. The 1984 line-up now featured greater use of keyboards by Crosby, as well as more emphasis on work by Howard, Smith and Waters. The band began to pare back the art rock elements of their earliest albums, although they retained a muscular, bass-driven sound, rounded off by the band&#x27;s distinctive horn section. Seymour&#x27;s lyrics became less abstruse and focused on the twin themes of the fraught personal relationships and the politics of the day.

The first album featuring the new line up was &quot;The Jaws of Life&quot; which appeared on 6 August 1984. McFarlane described it as having &quot;a stripped-down rock sound, a driving rhythm, more concise arrangements and stronger songs&quot;. While Toby Creswell writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt its &quot;aesthetic push ranged from the barrenness and isolation of outback Australia to the beer-swilling machismo of the suburbs&quot;. The album reached the top 100 in Australia and top 40 in New Zealand. Again co-produced with Plank, it was recorded at the old Can studio by René Tinner. The title, cover art and opening track, &quot;42 Wheels&quot;, all refer to the murder of five people by an intoxicated, outback trucker, Douglas Crabbe.

&quot;The Jaws of Life&quot; provided a single, &quot;The Slab&quot; (also in August), which did not chart. However relentless touring, airplay on radio station Triple J plus their music videos screening on &quot;Countdown&quot; and other music video shows, fostered a devoted following on the pub rock scene. In November they issued the first version of &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot; as a single-only, it had no chart success in Australia but reached No. 28 in New Zealand in the following March.

On 24 and 25 August 1984 Hunters &amp; Collectors performed two gigs at The Venue in Melbourne, the performances were recorded and filmed. For the gigs Smith and Waters also played organs. The band issued their first live album, &quot;The Way to Go Out&quot;, on 1 April 1985, which was recorded and mixed live by Miles. A month later the group released their first video album, on VHS, of the same name, which also included three previously aired music videos, &quot;Talking to a Stranger&quot;, &quot;Lumps of Lead&quot;, and &quot;Judas Sheep&quot;. The live album reached the top 100 in Australia and No. 21 in New Zealand. It &quot;captured all the ferocious power and muscular energy that characterised the band&#x27;s pub gigs&quot; according to McFarlane. A live version of &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot; also appeared on the album and VHS. Crosby left after &quot;The Way to Go Out&quot; was released and Waters took over on keyboards.

Greater Australian commercial success came in April 1986, with their fourth studio album, &quot;Human Frailty&quot;, which McFarlane found was &quot;a further refinement of the sinewy and dynamic approach established&quot; previously. It was co-produced by the group with Gavin MacKillop. Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, noted &quot;Seymour&#x27;s themes of alienation and sexual politics came to the fore&quot; with the album. It became their first Australian Top Ten album and reached No. 5 in New Zealand. In 2008 &quot;Human Frailty&quot;, was featured by SBS TV on the &quot;Great Australian Albums&quot; second series. Creswell presented the series and noted that &quot;the album documents, in the most candid terms, the course of a doomed love affair that [Seymour] was then going through. A parallel narrative is also running through the album, which is of a group adjusting to life on the road and an exploration of what it means to be Australian in the 1980s&quot;.

&quot;Say Goodbye&quot;, the lead single, was issued ahead of the album in February and peaked at No. 24 in Australia and No. 20 in New Zealand. The single&#x27;s back cover art includes their logo, a H &amp; C symbol, where the &quot;&amp;&quot; is stylised with twin snakes entwined around a hunting knife, a variation of a caduceus. Nimmervoll described how the group &quot;had discovered how to tap the unique vein they had unearthed; where, in a sweat-dripping venue packed to the rafters with a beer swilling macho rock fans the audience would and could at the top of their voices unselfconsciously sing along to a chorus like &#x27;you don&#x27;t make me feel like a woman any more&#x27;&quot;. The chorus appears in &quot;Say Goodbye&quot; and Pollyanna Sutton of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; felt that Seymour had written &quot;a line which he could sing in a pub with a lot of vulgarity that would get both guys and girls singing&quot;.

A third version of &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot; was recorded for the album and was issued as its second single, which peaked at No. 49 in Australia in May 1986. Eventually it became one of their most popular songs, voted in the Top 5 on the Triple J Hottest 100 for 1989, 1990, and 1991. Two further singles from &quot;Human Frailty&quot; were released, &quot;Everything&#x27;s on Fire&quot; (August 1986) and &quot;Is There Anybody in There?&quot; (October), both reached the top 50 in New Zealand but not in Australia. The band had signed a parallel deal with I.R.S. Records for North America, which released the album there in July 1987.

===1987–1991: &quot;Living Daylight&quot; to &quot;Collected Works&quot; ===
After &quot;Human Frailty&quot; appeared in Australia Hunters &amp; Collectors toured the US twice and then released their third EP, &quot;Living Daylight&quot;. It was co-produced with Greg Edward and released in Australia in April 1987. McFarlane felt it was &quot;something of a stop-gap measure&quot;. The three-track EP appeared on the Australian Top 50 Singles Chart and reached No. 25 in New Zealand. It was followed by their fifth studio album, &quot;What&#x27;s a Few Men?&quot;, also co-produced with Edward and released in November. It peaked at No. 16 in Australia and No. 9 in New Zealand.

The album provided the singles &quot;Do You See What I See&quot; (October) and &quot;Still Hangin&#x27; Round&quot; (February 1988). &quot;Do You See What I See&quot; reached the top 40 in Australia and in New Zealand it became their highest charting single at No. 13. &quot;Still Hangin&#x27; Round&quot; was deemed to be too &quot;Australian&quot;: it was cut from the US configuration of the album, which was retitled &quot;Fate&quot;, and released in September 1988. Three new tracks were recorded for the US CD version, including &quot;Back on the Breadline&quot;, which was issued as a single and charted at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks. In August 2003 a re-issue of &quot;What&#x27;s a Few Men?&quot; by the Liberation Blue label featured all 15 tracks from the two versions.

Early in 1988 Barry Palmer (also a member of Harem Scarem, ex-Stephen Cummings Band) joined the group on guitar. &quot;Ghost Nation&quot;, co-produced with Clive Martin and released in November 1989, was their second Australian Top Ten, it appeared on the ARIA Albums Chart. In New Zealand it reached the top 30 and also charted in Sweden reaching No. 31 on the Sverigetopplistan. McFarlane enthused &quot;[it] was perhaps the band&#x27;s finest album to date&quot;. However Allmusic&#x27;s Mike DeGagne declared that it was &quot;one of this Australian band&#x27;s weakest attempts, [it] suffers greatly from bland lyrics and gray instrumental work through the entirety of the album&quot;. It provided four singles, beginning with &quot;When the River Runs Dry&quot;, appearing in September and peaking at No. 23 in Australia in December and No. 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks in 1990.

Hunters &amp; Collectors supported Midnight Oil&#x27;s North American tour of 1990 and, although the band struggled to find further chart success in the US, they maintained their status in Australia and New Zealand as local favourites. During that year &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (Australia) named them Australian Band of the Year. Contemporary singer-songwriter, Paul Kelly, recalled that by the late 1980s the band &quot;were peaking in the pubs, gathering an army ... [the group] had a big, fat industrial bass sound, an anthemic horn section, and their singlet-clad singer [Seymour], as fit as a trout, held nothing back&quot;.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1990 the group were nominated in six categories and &quot;Ghost Nation&quot; won Best Cover Art for Miles&#x27; work. A compilation album, &quot;Collected Works&quot;, was released on 19 November 1990, and was another Top Ten album in Australia. It contained a fourth version of &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot; which was released as a single for a third time by December that year. It peaked at No. 34 in Australia – the highest position of all three versions. Another single, &quot;Where Do You Go&quot;, which was co-produced by Nick Sansano and issued in late 1991, also reached the Top 40.

===1992–1998: &quot;Cut&quot; to &quot;Under One Roof&quot;===
On 6 October 1992 Hunters &amp; Collectors released their seventh studio album, &quot;Cut&quot;, co-produced by Don Gehman (Jimmy Barnes), Sansano and the band. Although relationships were strained due to Gehman&#x27;s aggressive working methods, the band almost broke up during recording sessions, &quot;Cut&quot; peaked at No. 6 in Australia and No. 17 in New Zealand. It retained a balance between the band&#x27;s artistic core and its commercial ambitions.

The album provided six singles, all charted on the ARIA Singles Chart Top 100. The fourth one, &quot;True Tears of Joy&quot; from January 1993, peaked at No. 14 in Australia to become their highest charting single. It was followed by the anthemic single, &quot;Holy Grail&quot;. Seymour wrote the track, with Smith, after he had read a novel by Jeanette Winterson, &quot;The Passion&quot; (1987), detailing Napoleon&#x27;s march to Russia in 1812. Seymour&#x27;s lyrics also reflect the band&#x27;s own flagging attempts to &quot;crack&quot; the American market and their recent &quot;internal tension&quot; while recording &quot;Cut&quot;. &quot;I wanted to write a song to serve up this idea that regardless of what happens you&#x27;ve got to stay true to the quest&quot;. The song is often heard in context with the Australian Football League (AFL), and was Channel 10&#x27;s theme song for their AFL TV coverage from 2002 to 2006, it was sung by Seymour at the 2002 AFL Grand Final, although he doesn&#x27;t follow the game.

&quot;Demon Flower&quot;, their eighth studio album, followed on 16 May 1994, which was co-produced with Nick Mainsbridge (The Triffids, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Ratcat). McFarlane noticed that it &quot;featured a stronger emphasis on guitars&quot;. It peaked at No. 2 in Australia – their highest charting album – and No. 9 in New Zealand. &quot;Demon Flower&quot; provided &quot;Easy&quot;, which reached the top 40 in both countries, and three other singles, which did not chart. &quot;Demon Flower&quot; was dominated by themes relating to the politics in the state of Victoria, particularly the economic rationalist policies of Premier Jeff Kennett.

A double live album, &quot;Living ... In Large Rooms and Lounges&quot;, was released in November 1995, with one disc consisting of an acoustic set at the now-defunct Continental Cafe in Prahran, and the other was a typical pub performance. &quot;Juggernaut&quot;, their ninth studio album, was co-produced with Kalju Tonuma (The Mavis&#x27;s, Boom Crash Opera) and Mark Opitz (Hoodoo Gurus, Jimmy Barnes, INXS). The album was recorded in 1997 and released in January 1998, and featured the single &quot;True Believers&quot;. With its release, Hunters &amp; Collectors announced that they would disband after the Juggernaut Say Goodbye tour.

Hunters &amp; Collectors embarked on their final tour of Australia in 1998, with a concert performed at Selina&#x27;s, Coogee Bay Hotel, Sydney being recorded and released on CD and DVD as &quot;Under One Roof&quot;. The group&#x27;s last public show was on 22 March 1998 in Melbourne. According to rock historian, Ian McFarlane, their &quot;great achievement was to lay bare human emotions in the intensely ritualistic milieu of the pub-rock gig&quot;.

In March 2009 Seymour told Patrick Donovan of &quot;The Age&quot; &quot;It was a pretty serious decision to retire, and all the guys in the band are heavyweight professionals in their respective areas of employment. Obviously we have to put ourselves first. There&#x27;s just no momentum in the idea (of reforming)&quot;.

===1999–current: Post-breakup===

After leaving Hunters &amp; Collectors Tosti-Gueira was in Soldiers of Fortune. Lubran has worked for numerous artists including Permanent Press, The Dying People, Apocalypse, Connection, Great Temptation, Red=Yellow=Blue, The Index, The Possum Hunters, The Slaughtermen (1989), Mercy Mercy, Dave Graney and The White Buffalos (1989–90), The Trailblazers, Truckasaurus (1993), and George Huxley&#x27;s International Velvet. Perano has been a member of Pierre&#x27;s World, Swell Maps, Big Choir, Love Rodeo (1984–85), The Deadly Hume (1985–88), Funkicide, and Kylie Minogue Band (1990).

Back in August 1995, while still a member of Hunters &amp; Collectors, Palmer formed a side project, Deadstar, with Peter Jones (of Crowded House) on drums and percussion; and Caroline Kennedy on lead vocals and guitar. In 1996 Seymour undertook a solo tour and, with Palmer producing, he started recording his debut solo album, &quot;King Without a Clue&quot;, which was issued in October 1997. Deadstar members Palmer, Jones, and Kennedy had been joined by Seymour&#x27;s brother, Nick in November 1996; all were used on Seymour&#x27;s album. Subsequent to Hunters &amp; Collector&#x27;s disbandment in 1998, Seymour and Howard have each pursued solo musical careers. After Deadstar disbanded in 2001 Palmer became a producer-songwriter and was the subject of a 2005 reality TV series, &quot;The Hit Game&quot;.

&quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot; has been covered by many artists including Crowded House, Pearl Jam, Luka Bloom, and the Doug Anthony All Stars (and subsequently by member Paul McDermott). In May 2001 it was recognised by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. In 2009 the track was listed at No. 23 in Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 of All Time.

On 14 July 2005 Hunters &amp; Collectors were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame at the Plaza Ballroom alongside Split Enz, Renée Geyer, Normie Rowe, Smoky Dawson, and The Easybeats. They were inducted into the Hall of Fame by Peter Garrett, former lead singer of tour mates, Midnight Oil, At the ceremony Hunters &amp; Collectors provided a one-off performance of &quot;Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot;.

In 2008 Seymour published his memoirs, &quot;Thirteen Tonne Theory: Life Inside Hunters and Collectors&quot;, detailing his experiences with the group. He described the difficulty in writing tracks for the band with all members involved, &quot;the thing that ultimately made things more difficult was the sheer size of the band&quot;.

In his autobiography &quot;Small Moments of Glory&quot; (Brolga Publishing, 2020), Jack Howard wrote, &quot;In 2008, a special and wonderfully-packaged box set, in the form of a cabinet of architectural drawers, of all our recordings had been released&quot;. Titled &quot;Horn of Plenty&quot; (Liberation Records), the box set included 14 CDs and 2 DVDs; Noel Mengel of &quot;The News&quot; described it as the &quot;best box set&quot; of the year.

Hunters &amp; Collectors played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 14 March 2009 for Sound Relief, which was a multi-venue rock music concert in support of victims of the Victorian Bushfire Crisis. The event was held simultaneously with a concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground. All the proceeds from the Melbourne Concert went to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire relief. Appearing with Hunters &amp; Collectors in Melbourne were, Augie March, Bliss N Eso with Paris Wells, Gabriella Cilmi, Kasey Chambers &amp; Shane Nicholson with Troy Cassar-Daley, Jack Johnson, Jet, Kings of Leon, Liam Finn (joined on stage with Crowded House), Midnight Oil, Paul Kelly, Split Enz and Wolfmother.

Seymour expressed the group&#x27;s motivation &quot;This event is not about Hunters &amp; Collectors ... It&#x27;s about contributing to the groundswell of generosity that has emerged in the community after the cataclysm that&#x27;s been inflicted on people simply because of where they live. It&#x27;s a very big Australian story and it&#x27;s got a cultural dimension. It&#x27;s a huge honour to be part of it&quot;. Hunters &amp; Collectors performed a selection of their most popular songs over a 40-minute set, including an encore performance of &quot;The Slab&quot;. The Sound Relief concert, including the Hunters &amp; Collectors set, was broadcast on Australian cable TV and FM radio, which was released on DVD.

A tribute album, &quot;Crucible – The Songs of Hunters &amp; Collectors&quot;, was released in September 2013, including contributions by Birds of Tokyo, Eddie Vedder and Neil Finn (of Crowded House), Cloud Control, Something for Kate, and The Rubens, as well as a remix of the original &quot;Talking to a Stranger&quot; by The Avalanches.

The band reunited in their 1998 line-up of Archer, Falconer, Howard, Palmer, Seymour, Smith and Waters, at the 2013 AFL Grand Final playing &quot;Do You See What I See&quot; and &quot;The Holy Grail&quot;. They headlined a series of A Day on the Green outdoor concerts in early 2014, and supported Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band during their tour of Australia on 15 and 16 February 2014 at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium. Paul Busch of ToneDeaf website caught their gig on 4 April at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney: &quot;Seymour was in fine vocal form and the sound, although a bit too loud to start with, settled down ... The joy could also be seen in the energy of the band&quot;. On 12 April 2014 they performed their last concert for the reunion series at the Palais Theatre in St. Kilda. The band subsequently won the 2014 Helpmann Award for Best Australian Contemporary Concert.

In November 2017, &quot;Cut&quot;, the band&#x27;s 7th album was given a 25th anniversary release with a bonus disc of &quot;offcuts&quot;, &quot;precuts&quot; and &quot;postcuts&quot;.

The band was scheduled to reunite again to headline the Red Hot Summer Tour across Australia in early 2020, accompanied by James Reyne, The Living End, The Angels, Baby Animals, Killing Heidi and Boom Crash Opera. But the tour was eventually cancelled in the wake of COVID-19 and the subsequent pandemic.

<text>A tank locomotive is a steam locomotive which carries its water in one or more on-board water tanks, instead of a more traditional tender. Most tank engines also have bunkers (or fuel tanks) to hold fuel; in a tender-tank locomotive a tender holds some or all of the fuel, and may hold some water also.

There are several different types of tank locomotive, distinguished by the position and style of the water tanks and fuel bunkers. The most common type has tanks mounted either side of the boiler. This type originated about 1840 and quickly became popular for industrial tasks, and later for shunting and shorter-distance main line duties. 

Tank locomotives have advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional locomotives that required a separate tender to carry needed water and fuel.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

The first tank locomotive was the &quot;Novelty&quot; that ran at the Rainhill Trials in 1829. It was an example of a &quot;well tank&quot;. However, the more common form of &quot;side tank&quot; date from the 1840s; one of the first of these was supplied by George England and Co. of New Cross to the contractors building the Seaford branch line for the London Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1848. In spite of the early belief that such locomotives were inherently unsafe, the idea quickly caught on, particularly for industrial use and five manufacturers exhibited designs at The Great Exhibition in 1851. These were E. B. Wilson and Company, William Fairbairn &amp; Sons, George England, Kitson Thompson and Hewitson and William Bridges Adams. By the mid-1850s tank locomotives were to be found performing a variety of main line and industrial roles, particularly those involving shorter journeys or frequent changes in direction.

== Types==
There are a number of types of tank locomotive, based on the location and style of the water tanks.

===Side tank===
Side tanks are cuboid-shaped tanks which are situated on both sides of the boiler, extending all or part of the boiler&#x27;s length. The tank sides extend down to the running platform, if such is present, for at least part of their length. This was a common configuration in the UK.

The length of side tanks was often limited in order to give access to the valve gear (inside motion). Tanks that ran the full length of the boiler provided greater water capacity and, in this case, cut-outs in the rectangular tank gave access to the valve gear. Longer side tanks were sometimes tapered downwards at the front to improve forward visibility. Side tanks almost all stopped at, or before, the end of the boiler barrel, with the smokebox protruding ahead. A few designs did reach to the front of the smokebox and these were termed &#x27;flatirons&#x27;.

===Saddle tank===
The water tank sits on top of the boiler like a saddle sits atop a horse. Usually, the tank is curved in cross-section, although in some cases there were straight sides surmounted by a curve (like an inverted &#x27;U&#x27;), or even an ogee shape (a concave arc flowing into a convex arc). Walter Nielson patented the saddle tank arrangement in 1849.

Saddle tanks were a popular arrangement especially for smaller locomotives in industrial use. It gave a greater water supply, but limited the size of the boiler and restricted access to it for cleaning. Furthermore, the locomotive has a higher centre of gravity and hence must operate at lower speeds. The driver&#x27;s vision may also be restricted, again restricting the safe speed.

The squared-off shape of the Belpaire firebox does not fit easily beneath a saddle tank, and so most saddle tanks retained the older round-topped boiler instead. A few American locomotives used saddle tanks that only covered the boiler barrel, forward of the firebox.

Water in the tank is slightly pre-heated by the boiler, which reduces the loss of pressure found when cold feedwater is injected into the boiler. However, if the water becomes too hot, injectors lose efficiency and can fail. For this reason, the tanks often stopped short of the hotter and uninsulated smokebox.

==== Box tank ====
Box tank locomotives have saddle tanks but the tank itself is box shaped. These locomotives were used globally, the most extensive user of such locomotives was the United States with many box tanks being used on the Pennsylvania Railroad on older steam locomotives built during the 19th century.
===Pannier tank===

Pannier tanks are box-shaped tanks carried on the sides of the boiler, not carried on the locomotive&#x27;s running plates. This leaves a space between the tanks and the running plate. Pannier tanks have a lower centre of gravity than a saddle tank, whilst still giving the same easy access to the valve gear. Pannier tanks are so-named because the tanks are in a similar position to the panniers on a pack animal.


==== Belgium ====

In Belgium, pannier tanks were in use at least since 1866, once again in conjunction with Belpaire firebox. Locomotives were built for the Belgian State and for &quot;la Société Générale d&#x27;Exploitatation (SGE)&quot;, a private company grouping smaller secondary lines.
==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, pannier tank locomotives were used almost exclusively by the Great Western Railway. The first Great Western pannier tanks were converted from saddle tank locomotives when these were being rebuilt in the early 1900s with the Belpaire firebox. There were difficulties in accommodating the flat top of the latter within an encircling saddle tank which cut down capacity and increased the tendency to overheat the water in the tank. Pannier tank locomotives are often seen as an icon of the GWR.

====United States====

In Logging railroads in the Western USA used 2-6-6-2 Saddle tanks or Pannier tanks for heavy timber trains.

===Well tank===
In this design, used in earlier and smaller locomotives, the water is stored in a &#x27;well&#x27; on the underside of the locomotive, generally between the locomotive&#x27;s frames. This arrangement was patented by S.D. Davison in 1852. This does not restrict access to the boiler, but space is limited there, and the design is therefore not suitable for locomotives that need a good usable range before refilling. The arrangement does, however, have the advantage of creating a low centre of gravity, creating greater stability on poorly laid or narrow-gauge tracks. The first tank locomotive, &quot;Novelty&quot;, was a well tank.

=== Rear tank (or back tank) ===

In this design, the tank is placed behind the cab, usually over a supporting bogie. This removes the weight of the water from the driving wheels, giving the locomotive a constant tractive weight. The disadvantage is a reduction in water carrying capacity. A rear tank is an essential component of the American Forney type of locomotive, which is a 4-4-0 American-type with wheels reversed.

=== Wing tank ===

Wing tanks are side tanks that run the length of the smokebox, instead of the full length of the boiler. In the early 19th century the term &quot;wing tank&quot; was sometimes used as a synonym for side tank.

Wing tanks were mainly used on narrow-gauge industrial locomotives that could be frequently re-filled with water and where side or saddle tanks would restrict access to valve gear. The Kerry Tramway&#x27;s locomotive &quot;Excelsior&quot; has been described, by various sources, as both a wing tank and an inverted saddle tank.

=== Inverted saddle tank ===

The inverted saddle tank was a variation of the Wing Tank where the two tanks were joined underneath the smokebox and supported it. This rare design was used for the same reasons as the wing tank but provided slightly greater water capacity. The Brill Tramway locomotive &quot;Wotton&quot; is believed to have had an inverted saddle tank. The inverted saddle tank was a speciality of W.G.Bagnall.

=== Tender-tank ===

A tank locomotive may also haul a tender behind it. This was the common arrangement on the largest locomotives, as well as on narrow-gauge railways where the small size of the locomotive restricts the space available for fuel and water. These combined both fuel and water in a proportion (where coal was used) of 1 pound of coal for every 6 pounds of water..

Where a tender was used with a narrow-gauge locomotive it usually carried only fuel, with water carried in the locomotive&#x27;s tanks. The tender offered greater fuel capacity than a bunker on the locomotive and often the water capacity could be increased by converting redundant bunker space into a water tank.

=== Combinations ===

Large side tank engines might also have an additional rear tank (under the coal bunker), or a well tank (between the frames). This may have been to increase the water capacity, to equalise the weight distribution, or else improve the stability by lowering the centre of gravity.

== Locomotive classification and wheel arrangement ==
Because tank locomotives are capable of running equally fast in both directions (see below) they usually have symmetrical wheel arrangements to ensure the same ride and stability characteristics regardless of the direction travelled, producing arrangements with only driving wheels (e.g. and ) or equal numbers of leading and trailing wheels (e.g. and ). However other requirements, such as the need to support a large bunker, would require a non-symmetrical layout such as .

=== Whyte classification ===

In the Whyte notation for classification of locomotives (primarily by wheel arrangement), various suffixes are used to denote tank locomotives:
=== UIC classification ===

In the UIC notation which also classifies locomotives primarily by wheel arrangement, the suffix &#x27;t&#x27; is used to denote tank locomotives

== Fuel bunker ==
On tank locomotives which use solid fuels such as coal, a bunker is used to carry the fuel (for locomotives using liquid fuel such as oil, a Fuel tank is used). There are two main positions for bunkers on tank locomotives: to the rear of the cab (as illustrated in the left of the images below), a position typically used on locomotives with a trailing carrying axle or a trailing bogie; or on top of and to one side of the firebox, a positioning typically used in cases where the firebox overhangs the rear driving axle, as this counterbalances the overhanging weight of the firebox, stabilising the locomotive.


== Other types of tank locomotive ==
There are several other specialised types of steam locomotive which carry their own fuel but which are usually categorised for different reasons.

=== Garratt locomotive ===
A Garratt locomotive is articulated in three parts. The boiler is mounted on the centre frame without wheels, and two sets of driving wheels (4 cylinders total) carrying fuel bunkers and water tanks are mounted on separate frames, one on each end of the boiler. Articulation is used so larger locomotives can go around curves which would otherwise restrict the size of rigid framed locomotives. One of the major advantages of the Garratt form of articulation is the maintenance of the locomotive&#x27;s centre-of-gravity over or inside the track centre-line when rounding curves.

=== Crane tank locomotive ===
A crane tank (CT) is a steam tank locomotive fitted with a crane for working in railway workshops or other industrial environments. The crane may be fitted at the front, centre or rear.

=== Streamlined tank locomotive ===

During the 1930s there was a trend for express passenger locomotives to be streamlined by enclosed bodyshells. Express locomotives were nearly all tender locomotives, but a few fast tank engines were also streamlined, for use on high-speed, but shorter, services where turn-around time was important and the tank engine&#x27;s independence from turntables was useful. Examples included the German Class 61 and the Hungarian Class 242.

=== Contractor&#x27;s locomotive ===

The contractor&#x27;s locomotive was a small tank locomotive specially adapted for use by civil engineering contractor firms engaged in the building of railways. The locomotives would be used for hauling men, equipment and building materials over temporary railway networks built at the worksite that were frequently re-laid or taken up and moved elsewhere as building work progressed. Contractor&#x27;s locomotives were usually saddle or well tank types (see above) but required several adaptations to make them suitable for their task. They were built to be as light as possible so they could run over the lightly built temporary rails and had deeply flanged wheels so they did not de-rail on the tracks which were often very uneven.

At the same time, they had to be very powerful with good traction as they would often have to haul trains of wagons up very steep gradients, such as the sides of railway embankments or spoil heaps. Many were designed so that large iron ballast blocks could be fitted to the frames when extra weight and traction was required, then removed when it was not. Most had sanding gear fitted to all wheels for maximum traction. Some method of keeping mud and dust from clogging the wheels and brake shoes was also required – this either took the form of scraper bars fitted to the leading edge of the wheels or wheel washer jets supplied from the water tank. To handle long trains of loose-coupled (and often un-sprung) wagons, contractor&#x27;s locomotives usually had very effective steam-powered brakes. Most lacked a full cab, often only having a front &#x27;spectacle plate&#x27;. If a cab was provided it was usually removable along with the chimney, and sometimes the dome, so that the locomotive could be loaded onto a flatbed wagon for transport to new locations by rail whilst remaining within the loading gauge.

=== Steam tram engines ===

Steam tram engines, which were built, or modified, to work on a street, or roadside, tramway were almost universally also tank engines.

Tram engines had their wheels and motion enclosed to avoid accidents in traffic. They often had cow catchers to avoid road debris causing a derailment. Some tram engines were fitted with a roof and enclosed sides, giving them an appearance more like a goods wagon than a locomotive.

=== Vertical boiler locomotives ===
Railway locomotives with vertical boilers universally were tank locomotives. They were small, cheaper-to-operate machines mostly used in industrial settings.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

The benefits of tank locomotives include:
* Bi-directionality: Most tank locomotives are capable of running at full speed in either direction (although this depends on the wheel arrangement; for example, a 2-6-0T will not be able to run as fast in reverse, due to lack of a trailing truck). Most tender locomotives are unable to do this, because the heavy tender is not designed to be pushed and may become unstable at higher speeds. Tender locomotives generally require turning facilities, such as a turntable or wye, at each end of the run. A tank locomotive, on the other hand, can simply run around the train (provided there is a siding) and pull it back in the other direction. The crew of a tank engine generally have a better view in the reverse direction than for a tender engine and are protected from the weather.
* Fuel and water add to adhesive weight: The usable tractive weight of a locomotive is the product of the weight on its driving wheels multiplied by the factor of adhesion. Therefore, up to the limits of the maximum permissible axle loading, and other loading limits, the more weight on the driving wheels the better. In a tank locomotive the weight of its own fuel and water increase the available tractive weight.
* Compactness: A tank locomotive is shorter than the equivalent tender locomotive. This is important in environments with limited space for locomotives, such as the headshunt of a run-round loop.
* Efficiency: Many train tanks are designed to be in contact with, and be heated by, the boiler. Pre-heated water will reach boiling point faster than the colder water available from a tender. On the other hand, excessively hot water can interfere with steam injector operation and is to be avoided.
There are disadvantages:
* Limited fuel and water capacity: A tender can typically contain far more of both than is available on a tank locomotive. This restricts the range of tank locomotives between fueling and watering points. This is one reason why tank engines were more popular in Europe and the UK than in America or other places, because the distances were shorter between refueling stations and water towers.
* Varying adhesive weight: As the water in the tanks is used up, the overall adhesive weight of the locomotive decreases, which in turn reduces the train weight the locomotive can pull. Locomotives with low water supplies also typically ride less well as there is less weight on the springs.
* Instability: Water surging inside large side tanks can cause the locomotive to become unstable and prone to derailment, as was the case with the LB&amp;SCR L class 4-6-4T before they were modified.
* Axle loading limits a problem: For larger tank locomotives, it is hard to put much fuel and water aboard without requiring more axles than a rigid frame can handle.
* Limit of boiler diameter: The boiler and water tanks must fit within the loading gauge of the railway being run on. Above a certain diameter of boiler there is little or no room for water tanks to be added and still fit within the loading gauge.

== Popularity ==
Worldwide, tank engines varied in popularity. They were more common in areas where the length of run was short, and a quick turn around time was needed or turning facilities were not available, mostly in Europe. With their limited fuel and water capacity, they were not favoured in areas where long runs between stops were the norm.

They were very common in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. In the United Kingdom, they were frequently used for shunting and piloting duties, suburban passenger services and local freight. The GWR was famous for its Prairie tanks (such as the &quot;61xx&quot; class), used for many things including very heavy trains on the Welsh valley coal mining lines that the GWR 4200 Class were designed for. In Germany, too, large tank locomotives were built. In the United States they were used for push-pull suburban service, switching in terminals and locomotive shops, and in logging, mining and industrial service.

<text>The maternal mortality ratio is a key performance indicator (KPI) for efforts to improve the health and safety of mothers before, during, and after childbirth per country worldwide. Often referred to as MMR, it is the annual number of female deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes). It is not to be confused with the maternal mortality rate, which is the number of maternal deaths (direct and indirect) in a given period per 100,000 women of reproductive age during the same time period. The statistics are gathered by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group, and the United Nations Population Division. The yearly report started in 1990 and is called &quot;Trends in Maternal Mortality&quot;. As of the 2015 data published in 2016, the countries that have seen an increase in the maternal mortality ratio since 1990 are the Bahamas, Georgia, Guyana, Jamaica, Dem. People’s Rep. Korea, Serbia, South Africa, St. Lucia, Suriname, Tonga, United States, Venezuela, RB Zimbabwe. But according to Sustainable Development Goals report 2018, the overall maternal mortality ratio has declined by 37 percent since 2002. Nearly 303,000 women died due to complications during pregnancy.

With an exceptionally high mortality ratio compared to other U.S. states, the government of Texas created the Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force in 2013.

==Country measurements==

This KPI was used for the Millennium Development Goals from 2000 to 2015 and is part of the Sustainable Development Goals. The list of countries with a comparison of this KPI in 1990, 2000 and 2015 are:

<doc id="346515" wikidata="Q2263360" url="?curid=346515" title="Interstate 691">
<text>Interstate 691 (I-691) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway in Connecticut running from I-84 in Southington east to I-91 in Meriden. According to the Federal Highway Administration, it is in length; however, the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) includes the 0.54 miles (0.87 km) of the exit ramp that I-691 uses to the merge with westbound I-84, making their recorded length long.

I-691 is also known as the Henry D. Altobello Highway for its entire length.

==Route description==
I-691 is the main east–west highway of the city of Meriden. The freeway actually begins in Middlefield as Route 66, technically becoming I-691 at the junction with I-91 (exit 11). However, westbound signage indicates I-691 begins at the start of the freeway (just west of exit 13), while eastbound signage shows I-691 ending at the Route 15 interchange (at eastbound exit 10 about west of the interchange with I-91). To go from I-91 northbound to I-691 westbound (or from I-691 eastbound to I-91 southbound), one must actually use Route 15. Exit 9 westbound provides access to Route 15 north.

West of the I-91/Route 15 interchange, I-691 meets U.S. Route 5 (US 5), which provides access to Route 15 north for eastbound traffic. Exit 7 provides access to downtown Meriden. Westbound traffic exits onto State Street Extension, while eastbound traffic enters onto Columbia Street. Exits 6 and 5 provide access to Route 71, as well as access to Meriden Mall. Exit 6 exits to Lewis Avenue, while exit 5 exits directly to Route 71. From here, I-691 passes along the north side of Hubbard Park as well as by Castle Craig before it crosses into Southington. It then meets the eastern end of Route 322 at exit 4. It then crosses the Quinnipiac River into Cheshire, where it has an interchange with Route 10, then continues west to end at I-84 in Southington. The highway officially ends as it merges into I-84 west.

==History==

In the 1940s, the I-691 routing was part of a planned US 6A expressway from Southington to Willimantic. A section of the expressway (from its Middlefield terminus west to exit 8) first opened in 1966. By 1968, the US 6A designation was dropped in favor of Route 66. The highway was extended west to exit 4 by 1971. The connection to I-84 was eventually completed in 1987, with the renumbering to I-691 done at the same time. The portion east of I-91 remained as Route 66. Environmental and community groups successfully blocked attempts to extend the freeway east of its present terminus due to potential impacts on the Mt. Higby Reservoir, which provides drinking water for the local area. A compromise was reached in the late 1990s allowing CTDOT to convert Route 66 from a two-lane road to four lanes from the eastern end of the I-691 freeway to the business district in Middletown. Construction on the Route 66 widening project was completed in 2005.

==Exit list==
&quot;Exit numbers were converted from sequential to mile-based in April of 2023.&quot;

<doc id="346518" wikidata="Q941054" url="?curid=346518" title="Geoffrey de Clinton">
<text>Geoffrey de Clinton (died c. 1134) was an Anglo-Norman noble, chamberlain and treasurer to King Henry I of England. He was foremost amongst the men king Henry &quot;raised from the dust&quot;. He married Lescelina.

==Life==
Clinton&#x27;s family origins are a little obscure. The surname probably derives from the village of Glympton in Oxfordshire., though the family ultimately hailed from
Saint-Pierre-de-Semilly (Manche, arr. St. Lô, canton St.-Clair) in western Normandy.

It appears that Clinton spent some years as a minor official of the king, until the 1118 fall of the treasurer Herbert &quot;camerarius&quot;, who was accused of plotting against the king. By 1120 Clinton had taken his place.

Not too long afterwards Clinton was appointed Sheriff of Warwickshire (c. 1121), to act as counterweight to the Earl of Warwick, Roger de Beaumont, whom Henry I did not trust. The 1122 rebellion of Roger&#x27;s cousin Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester increased the king&#x27;s suspicions still further, and he compelled Roger to grant Clinton substantial parts of his Warwickshire domain.

Clinton further secured his position by starting work on the great castle of Kenilworth, only five miles from the Beaumonts&#x27; central fortress at Warwick.

Clinton received other grants of land from Henry I, and he used his position of political influence to enrich himself in other ways; his sum total of wealth rose to become just below the level of the greatest magnates of the kingdom. He had enough to spend 2,000 pounds to insure his nephew Roger de Clinton&#x27;s election as Bishop of Coventry.

Around Easter 1130 Clinton was accused of treason, but was acquitted by a tribunal including King David I of Scotland, who was sitting in his capacity as Earl of Huntingdon. The substance of the accusations against Clinton are not known, although since he was Henry I&#x27;s treasurer, financial malfeasance of some sort seems possible. The Beaumonts were back in favor, and it may be that they were behind the proceedings.

Clinton remained in the royal service, though he was never as influential as he had been. He died sometime between 1133 and 1135.

It appears that Clinton&#x27;s land-holding must have been primarily life tenancies since his descendants&#x27; property was not nearly so great. His son and successor, also named Geoffrey, became engaged in a violent quarrel with the Earl of Warwick early in the reign of King Stephen of England. The Clintons nearly lost everything, but in the end a settlement was reached (probably in the summer of 1138) by which the younger Geoffrey de Clinton married Warwick&#x27;s daughter Agnes.

The direct Clinton male line seems to have died out during the reign of Henry III. The later Baron Clintons, Earls of Lincoln, and Dukes of Newcastle-Under-Lyne descend from the elder Geoffrey&#x27;s nephew Osbert de Clinton.

<doc id="346530" wikidata="Q3010429" url="?curid=346530" title="Porphyria's Lover">
<text>&quot;Porphyria&#x27;s Lover&quot; is a poem by Robert Browning which was first published as &quot;Porphyria&quot; in the January 1836 issue of &quot;Monthly Repository&quot;. Browning later republished it in &quot;Dramatic Lyrics&quot; (1842) paired with &quot;Johannes Agricola in Meditation&quot; under the title &quot;Madhouse Cells&quot;. The poem did not receive its definitive title until 1863.

&quot;Porphyria&#x27;s Lover&quot; is Browning&#x27;s first ever short dramatic monologue, and also the first of his poems to examine abnormal psychology. Although its initial publication passed nearly unnoticed and received little critical attention in the nineteenth century, the poem is now heavily anthologised and much studied.

In the poem, a man strangles his lover – Porphyria – with her hair; &quot;... and all her hair / In one long yellow string I wound / Three times her little throat around, / And strangled her.&quot; Porphyria&#x27;s lover then talks of the corpse&#x27;s blue eyes, golden hair, and describes the feelings of perfect happiness the murder gives him and his surprise at God&#x27;s subsequent silence. Although he winds her hair around her throat three times to throttle her, the woman never cries out. The poem uses a somewhat unusual rhyme scheme: A,B,A,B,B, the final repetition bringing each stanza to a heavy rest.

A possible source for the poem is John Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Extracts from Gosschen&#x27;s Diary&quot;, a lurid account of a murder published in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1818. Browning&#x27;s friend and fellow poet Bryan Procter acknowledged basing his 1820 &quot;Marcian Colonna&quot; on this source, but added a new detail; after the murder, the killer sits up all night with his victim.

==Psychological interpretations==

Browning&#x27;s monologues are frequently voiced by eccentrics, lunatics, or people under emotional stress. Their ramblings illustrate character by describing the interactions of an odd personality with a particularly telling set of circumstances. In both &quot;Porphyria&#x27;s Lover&quot; and &quot;My Last Duchess&quot;, Browning uses this mode of exposition to describe a man who responds to the love of a beautiful woman by killing her. Each monologue offers the speaker&#x27;s reasons for the desired woman from subject to object: in &quot;My Last Duchess&quot;, the Duke may have jealously murdered his wife, but keeps a portrait of her behind a curtain so none can look upon her smile without his permission; in &quot;Porphyria&#x27;s Lover&quot;, the persona wishes to stop time at a single perfect moment and so kills his lover and sits all night embracing her carefully arranged body. In &quot;My Last Duchess&quot; the woman&#x27;s murder is at best implied, while in &quot;Porphyria&#x27;s Lover&quot; it is described quite explicitly by the speaker. The unchanging rhythmic pattern may also suggest the persona&#x27;s insanity. 
The &quot;Porphyria&quot; persona&#x27;s romantic egotism leads him into all manner of monstrously selfish assumptions compatible with his own longings. He seems convinced that Porphyria wanted to be murdered, and claims &quot;No pain felt she&quot; while being strangled, adding, as if to convince himself, &quot;I am quite sure she felt no pain.&quot; He may even believe she enjoyed the pain, because he, her lover, inflicted it. When she is dead, he says she has found her &quot;utmost will&quot;, and when he sees her lifeless head drooping on his shoulder, he describes it as a &quot;smiling rosy little head&quot;, possibly using the word &quot;rosy&quot; to symbolise the red roses of love, or to demonstrate his delusion that the girl, and their relationship, are still alive. More likely, however, is the thought that blood returning to her face, after the strangulation, makes her cheeks &quot;rosy&quot;. Her &quot;rosy little head&quot; may also be a sly reference to the hymen; Porphyria leaves a &quot;gay feast&quot; and comes in from the outside world wearing &quot;soiled gloves&quot;; now her blue eyes, open in death, are &quot;without a stain&quot;. The lover may also be a fetishist, indicated by the fact that he refers to her hair numerous times throughout the poem, and strangles her with it. He also refers to the &quot;shut bud that holds a bee&quot; which backs up the view of it being a sexual fetish.

Other sources speculate that the lover might be impotent, disabled, sick, or otherwise inadequate, and, as such, unable to satisfy Porphyria. There is much textual evidence to support this interpretation: he describes himself as &quot;one so pale / for love of her, and all in vain.&quot; At the beginning of the poem, the persona never moves; he sits passively in a cold, dark room, sadly listening to the storm until Porphyria comes through &quot;wind and rain&quot;, &quot;shuts the cold out and the storm,&quot; and makes up his dying fire. Finally, she sits beside him, calls his name, places his arm around her waist, and puts his head on her shoulder; she has to stoop to do this. At the poem&#x27;s midpoint, the persona suddenly takes action, strangling Porphyria, propping her body against his, and boasting that afterward, &quot;her&quot; head lay on &quot;his&quot; shoulder.

In line with the persona&#x27;s suggested weakness and sickness, other scholars take the word &quot;porphyria&quot; literally, and suggest that the seductress embodies a disease, and that the persona&#x27;s killing of her is a sign of his recovery. Porphyria, which usually involved delusional madness and death, was classified several years before the poem&#x27;s publication; Browning, who had an avid interest in such pathologies, may well have been aware of the new disease, and used it in this way to express his knowledge.

Much has been made of the final line: &quot;And yet, God has not said a word!&quot; Possibly, the speaker seeks divine condonement for the murder. He may believe God has said nothing because He is satisfied with his actions. God may be satisfied because: He recognises that the persona&#x27;s crime is the only way to keep Porphyria pure; or, because He doesn&#x27;t think her life and death are important compared to the persona&#x27;s. The persona may also be waiting in vain for some sign of God&#x27;s approval. Alternatively, the line may represent his feelings of emptiness in the wake of his violence; Porphyria is gone, quiet descends, and he&#x27;s alone. The persona may also be schizophrenic; he may be listening for a voice in his head, which he mistakes for the voice of God. It has also been postulated that this is Browning&#x27;s statement of &quot;God&#x27;s silence&quot;, in which neither good nor bad acts are immediately recompensed by the deity.

The final line may also register the persona&#x27;s sense of guilt over his crime. Despite his elaborate justifications for his act, he has, in fact, committed murder, and he expects God to punish him – or, at least, to take notice. The persona is surprised, perhaps a little uneasy, at God&#x27;s continued silence.

==As tableau vivant==
The mirrored effect produced by Porphyria&#x27;s modelling of the persona in the first half, and the persona&#x27;s reciprocal modelling of her after strangulation is indicative of the popular Victorian art form tableau vivant, in which humans were used as art to recreate actual paintings. This is indicative of the allegorical content of &quot;Porphyria&#x27;s Lover&quot; in which both characters imitate the process of artistic creation: when art is created or published, it is dead and forever unchanging. In the last few lines of the poem, Porphyria is manipulated in much the same way as the speaker was in the first few lines of the poem. Tennyson shares similar ideas in &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;, as do other Victorian authors who contribute to the popular conversation about the artistic processes.

<text>Jacques-Maurice Couve de Murville (; 24 January 1907 – 24 December 1999) was a French diplomat and politician who was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1958 to 1968 and Prime Minister from 1968 to 1969 under the presidency of General de Gaulle. As foreign minister he played the leading role in the critical Franco-German treaty of cooperation in 1963, he laid the foundation for the Paris-Bonn axis that was central in building a united Europe.

==Life==

He was born Maurice Couve (his father acquired the name de Murville in 1925) in Reims. Maurice Couve de Murville, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham (1929–2007), was his cousin.

Couve de Murville joined the corps of finance inspectors in 1930, and in 1940 became Director of External Finances of the Vichy régime, in which capacity he sat at the armistice council of Wiesbaden. In March 1943, after the American landing in North Africa, he was one of the few senior officials of Vichy to join the Free French. He left for Algiers, via Spain, where he joined General Henri Giraud. On 7 June 1943, he was named commissioner of finance of the French Committee of National Liberation (CFLN). A few months later, he joined General Charles de Gaulle. In February 1945, he became a member of the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF) with the rank of ambassador attached to the Italian government.

After the war, he occupied several posts as French Ambassador, in Cairo (1950 to 1954), at NATO (1954), in Washington (1955 to 1956) and in Bonn (1956 to 1958). When General de Gaulle returned to power in 1958, he became Foreign Minister, a post he retained for ten years until the reshuffle that followed the events of May 1968 where he replaced Finance minister Michel Debré, keeping this post only a short time: very soon after the elections, he became a transitional Prime Minister, replacing Georges Pompidou. The following year he was succeeded by Jacques Chaban-Delmas.

Couve de Murville continued his political career first as a UDR deputy, then RPR deputy for Paris until 1986, then as a senator until 1995. He died in Paris at the age of 92 from natural causes.

<doc id="346543" wikidata="Q83066" url="?curid=346543" title="Coloman, King of Hungary">
<text>Coloman the Learned, also the Book-Lover or the Bookish (; ; ; 10703February 1116), was King of Hungary from 1095 and King of Croatia from 1097 until his death. Because Coloman and his younger brother Álmos were underage when their father Géza I died, their uncle Ladislaus I ascended the throne in 1077. Ladislaus prepared Colomanwho was &quot;half-blind and humpbacked&quot;, according to late medieval Hungarian chroniclesfor a church career, and Coloman was eventually appointed bishop of Eger or Várad (Oradea, Romania) in the early 1090s. The dying King Ladislaus preferred Álmos to Coloman when nominating his heir in early 1095. Coloman fled from Hungary but returned around 19 July 1095 when his uncle died. He was crowned in early 1096; the circumstances of his accession to the throne are unknown. He granted the Hungarian Duchyone-third of the Kingdom of Hungaryto Álmos.

In the year of Coloman&#x27;s coronation, at least five large groups of crusaders arrived in Hungary on their way to the Holy Land. He annihilated the bands who were entering his kingdom unauthorized or pillaging the countryside, but the main crusader army crossed Hungary without incident. He invaded Croatia in 1097, defeating its last native king Petar Snačić. Consequently, he was crowned king of Croatia in 1102. According to the late 14th-century &quot;Pacta conventa&quot; (the authenticity of which is not universally accepted by scholars), he was only crowned after having ratified a treaty with the leaders of the Croatian nobility. For centuries thereafter, the Hungarian monarchs were also the kings of Croatia.

Coloman had to face his brother&#x27;s attempts to dethrone him throughout his life; Álmos devised plots to overthrow him on at least five occasions. In retaliation, he seized his brother&#x27;s duchy in 1107 or 1108 and had Álmos and Álmos&#x27; son Béla blinded in about 1114. Hungarian chronicles, which were compiled in the reigns of kings descending from his mutilated brother and nephew, depict Coloman as a bloodthirsty and unfortunate monarch. On the other hand, he is portrayed as &quot;the most well-versed in the science of letters among all the kings of his day&quot; by the contemporaneous chronicler Gallus Anonymus. Coloman&#x27;s decrees, which governed many aspects of lifeincluding taxation, trade and relations between his Christian and non-Christian subjectsremained unmodified for more than a century. He was the first Hungarian king to renounce control of the appointment of prelates in his realms.

== Early years (&quot;c.&quot; 1070–1095) ==

Coloman was the elder of the two sons of King Géza I who survived infancy. Géza&#x27;s Byzantine second wifewhose baptismal name is unknownleft Hungary after her husband&#x27;s death, implying that she was not his children&#x27;s mother. Consequently, the mother of Coloman and his younger brother, Álmos, must have been Géza&#x27;s first wife, Sophia, whose family is unknown. According to historians Gyula Kristó and Márta Font, the brothers were born around 1070, because they were mature enough to hold offices in the early 1090s. Coloman&#x27;s uncommon baptismal name was recorded as Colomanus or Colombanus in medieval documents written in Latin. Kristó writes that he was most probably named after Saint Coloman of Stockerau, a missionary who was martyred in Austria in the early 11th century. Another possibility is that his name is of Turkish origin (meaning &quot;rest&quot;), because his brother bore a Turkish name.

Coloman&#x27;s father ascended the throne in 1074. Because Coloman and Álmos were minors when he died on 25April 1077, Géza&#x27;s brother Ladislaus I succeeded him. The new king decided that Coloman should be prepared for a career in the Church. The king&#x27;s decision was unusual as Coloman was older than Álmos and elder brothers were rarely ordained priests. The 14th-century &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; stated that Coloman was &quot;of mean stature, but astute and quick of apprehension&quot;, adding that he was &quot;shaggy and hirsute, half-blind and humpbacked, and he walked with a limp and stammered in his speech&quot;. If the chronicle preserved genuine tradition of his appearance, his physical deformity may have influenced his uncle&#x27;s decision. However, modern scholars tend to refute this view, emphasizing that the chronicle was completed in the reigns of kings descending from Álmos.

In preparation for his clerical life, Coloman learnt to read and write and acquired a good knowledge of Latin. His proficiency in canon law was praised in a letter that Pope Urban II addressed to him in 1096. According to Kristó, upon finishing his studies he was ordained priest and in the early 1090s was appointed bishop. Hungarian chronicles completed in the 14th and 15th centuries say that Coloman was bishop of either Eger or Várad. For instance, the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; states that he was &quot;bishop of Warad&quot; (or Várad), and LadislausI wanted to appoint him &quot;bishop of Agria&quot; (or Eger).

According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, both Coloman and Álmos accompanied their uncle on a military campaign against Bohemia in early 1095. Before reaching the border of his kingdom, LadislausI &quot;was overcome by a grave infirmity&quot; and decided to appoint Álmos as his heir. Instead of obeying his uncle&#x27;s decision, Coloman fled to Poland. He returned to Hungary around 29July 1095 when his uncle died. The exact circumstances of his ascension to the throne are uncertain. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; states Ladislaus had invited him back from Poland. The same source adds that Álmos, &quot;in the true simplicity of his heart honoured his brother, Coloman, and yielded to him the crown of the kingdom&quot;, which suggests that he ascended the throne without bloodshed. On the other hand, Coloman was crowned king in early 1096, the delay implying that the two brothers had been fighting for the crown before they reached an agreement. It is also possible, as proposed by Font, that he could only be crowned after Pope UrbanII had released him from his clerical vows.

== Reign ==
=== Facing the crusaders (1095–1096) ===
Coloman was crowned in Székesfehérvár by Archbishop Seraphin of Esztergom. According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, at the same time he &quot;granted the dukedom with full rights&quot; to Álmos. This report shows that Álmos only acknowledged his brother&#x27;s rule in exchange for receiving the duchy once held by their father and grandfather, an area that comprised one third of the territory of the kingdom.

Shortly after his coronation, Coloman had to face problems that the armies of the First Crusade caused while passing through Hungary. For decades, Hungary had been able to supply a significant number of Western European pilgrims with food during their journey to the Holy Land, but the movement of tens of thousands of crusaders across the country endangered the natives&#x27; subsistence. The first group of crusaders, led by Walter Sans Avoir, reached the frontier in early May 1096. Coloman received them in a friendly way and allowed them into the kingdom. He also authorized them to buy food in the markets, although harvest had not started yet. They proceeded through Hungary without any major conflicts. The only incident occurred near the Hungarian–Byzantine border at Zimony (Zemun, Serbia). Here, &quot;certain Hungarians with evil minds&quot; attacked sixteen crusaders who had tried to buy weapons near the town, seizing the crusaders&#x27; clothes, armor, and money.

The next arrivals, headed by Peter the Hermit, arrived in late May or early June. Coloman permitted them to enter Hungary only after Peter pledged that he would prevent them from pillaging the countryside. According to Guibert of Nogent&#x27;s records, Peter could not keep his promise: the crusaders &quot;burned the public granaries ..., raped virgins, dishonored many marriage beds by carrying off many women&quot;, although &quot;the Hungarians, as Christians to Christians, had generously offered everything for sale&quot; to them. Peter himself claimed that he and his companions had passed through the country without incident until they reached Zimony, where they learnt of the story of the sixteen crusaders who had been robbed by the Hungarians. The crusaders besieged and took the town, where they massacred &quot;[a]bout four thousand Hungarians&quot;, according to the contemporaneous Albert of Aix&#x27;s estimation. They only withdrew when Coloman&#x27;s troops approached them.

A third band of crusaders reached Nyitra (Nitra, Slovakia) and began plundering the region. These were soon routed by the locals. A fourth army came to Moson in the middle of June. Coloman did not allow them to leave the region, either because he had learnt of their troublesome behavior during their journey, or he had realized that their movement across Hungary could jeopardize the stability of the local economy. To seize food and wine, the crusaders made frequent pillaging raids against the nearby settlements. Coloman decided to attack them, but the commanders of the army convinced him to persuade the crusaders to surrender their weapons and money, promising them that they would be supplied with food during their journey. After the crusaders were disarmed, Coloman&#x27;s troops attacked and massacred them near Pannonhalma in early July.

Alarmed by these incidents, Coloman forbade the crusaders who arrived under the leadership of Count Emicho in the middle of July to enter Hungary. Ignoring the king&#x27;s order, they broke through the defensive lines and laid siege to Moson. Their catapults destroyed the walls in two places, enabling them to storm into the fortress on 15August. Coloman made preparations to flee to Rus&#x27;, fearing that the crusaders would occupy the whole country. However, for no apparent reason, a panic broke out among the attackers that enabled the garrison to carry out a sortie and rout them. Modern scholars agree that rumours about the sudden arrival of Coloman&#x27;s army frightened the crusaders off from the fortress. According to Albert of Aix, contemporaneous Christians thought that Emicho&#x27;s defeat was a punishment that God inflicted on the pilgrims because they had massacred many Jews &quot;rather from greed for their money than for divine justice&quot;.

The first crusader army organized by the Holy See reached the borders of Hungary in September 1096. It was led by Godfrey of Bouillon, Duke of Lower Lorraine. Godfrey sent a knight who had already been known to Coloman to start negotiations about the crusaders&#x27; entry into Hungary. Eight days later, Coloman agreed to meet with Godfrey in Sopron. The king allowed the crusaders to march through his kingdom but stipulated that Godfrey&#x27;s younger brother Baldwin and his family should stay with him as hostages. The crusaders passed through Hungary peacefully along the right bank of the Danube; Coloman and his army followed them on the left bank. He only released his hostages after all the crusaders had crossed the river Sava, which marked the kingdom&#x27;s southern frontier. The uneventful march of the main crusader army across Hungary established Coloman&#x27;s good reputation throughout Europe.

The contemporaneous Cosmas of Prague wrote that &quot;some of the Jews&quot; who had been persecuted by the crusaders in Bohemia arrived in Hungary and &quot;secretly took their wealth away with them&quot;. Although Cosmas does not specify their number, László Mezey and other historians say that the Jews represented a large influx. Coloman issued a number of decrees and separate statutes&quot;Capitula de Iudeis&quot;regulating the position of Jews in Hungary. For instance, he forbade them from holding Christian slaves and residing &quot;outside episcopal sees&quot;. Historian Nora Berend writes that the &quot;defence of purity of Christians by interdictions against mingling with Jews plays a very minor role&quot; in Coloman&#x27;s legislation in comparison with late 12th-century canon law. Whereas he did not try to convert the Jews, he issued decrees aimed at the conversion of his Muslim subjects. For instance, he prescribed that if a Muslim &quot;has a guest, or anyone invited to dinner, both he and his table companions shall eat only pork for meat&quot; in order to prevent Muslims from observing their dietary laws.

=== Expansion, internal conflicts and legislation (1096–1105) ===

After Coloman&#x27;s victories over the crusaders, Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, whom LadislausI had supported against Pope UrbanII in his last years, wrote a letter to Duke Álmos. The emperor stated that Coloman had neglected imperial interests &quot;because of his own necessities&quot;, and asked the duke to intervene on his behalf. However, Colomana former bishopabandoned his predecessor&#x27;s foreign policy and supported the pope. Historian Gyula Kristó writes that Álmos&#x27;s close relationship with Emperor Henry may also have influenced Coloman&#x27;s decision. Coloman married Felicia, a daughter of Roger I of Sicilya close ally of the Holy Seein 1097. Her sister Constance had married Conrad, the elder son of Emperor HenryIV, after he allied with the pope against his father.

Coloman invaded Croatia in 1097. LadislausI had already occupied most of the country, but Petar Snačić, the last native king of Croatia, resisted him in the Mala Kapela mountains. Petar Snačić died fighting against Coloman&#x27;s army in the Battle of Gvozd Mountain. The Hungarian troops reached the Adriatic Sea and occupied Biograd na Moru, an important port. Threatened by the advance of Coloman&#x27;s army, the citizens of the towns of Trogir and Split swore fidelity to the doge of Venice, Vitale Michiel, who had sailed to Dalmatia. Having no fleet, Coloman sent envoys with a letter to the doge to &quot;remove all the former misunderstandings concerning what is due to one of us or the other by right of our predecessors&quot;. Their agreement of 1098the so-called &quot;Conventio Amicitiae&quot;determined the spheres of interest of each party by allotting the coastal regions of Croatia to Hungary and Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice.

Taking advantage of Coloman&#x27;s absence, Álmos began to conspire against the king and mustered his armies. Coloman returned from Croatia and marched his army towards his brother&#x27;s duchy in 1098. The two armies met at Tiszavárkony, with only the river Tisza separating them. However, the commanders of the two troops started negotiations and decided not to fight each other, compelling the king and the duke to make peace.

Grand Prince Svyatopolk II of Kiev sent his son Iaroslav – who was the husband of one of Coloman&#x27;s nieces – to Hungary to seek assistance against the princes of the westernmost regions of Rus&#x27; in 1099. Iaroslav persuaded Coloman to intervene in the conflict. Coloman and his army crossed the Carpathian Mountains and laid siege to Peremyshl (Przemyśl, Poland)the seat of Volodar Rostislavich, one of the rebellious princes. David Igorevich, one of Volodar Rostislavich&#x27;s allies, persuaded the Cumans to attack the Hungarians. In the ensuing battle, the Hungarian army was soundly defeated. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; says that &quot;[r]arely did Hungarians suffer such slaughter as in this battle&quot;. According to the &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot;, many Hungarians &quot;were drowned, some in the Vyagro and others in the San&quot;, after the battle. Coloman himself narrowly escaped from the battlefield through the valley of the San. Shortly after his return from Rus&#x27;, Coloman hastened towards the Bohemian border to assist the dukes of MoraviaSvatopluk and Ottoagainst Duke Bretislaus II of Bohemia. He had a meeting with Bretislaus on the border river Olšava &quot;in the field of Lučsko&quot; where &quot;they renewed their age-old bonds of friendship and peace and confirmed them with oaths&quot;, according to Cosmas of Prague.

Coloman decided to review his predecessors&#x27; decrees around 1100. Because he regarded Stephen I of Hungary, who had been canonized in 1083, as his ideal, he &quot;assembled the magnates of the kingdom and reviewed with the advice of the entire council the text of the laws&quot; of Stephen I. The assembly also passed decrees, which regulated several aspects of the economy and tempered the harshness of the legislation of LadislausI. One of the decrees prohibited the persecution of &quot;strigae&quot;vampires or maresbecause they &quot;do not exist&quot;. The same law also dealt with &quot;malefici&quot; or &quot;sorcerers&quot;, punishing their misdeeds. Taxes on trade were increased under Coloman, implying that commerce flourished in his reign. However, his legislation prohibited the export of Hungarian slaves and horses. Coins minted during his reign were smaller than those issued in his predecessor&#x27;s reign to prevent the cutting down of their smooth edge.

Coloman was crowned king of Croatia in Biograd na Moru in 1102. In the 13thcentury, Thomas the Archdeacon wrote that the union of Croatia and Hungary was the consequence of conquest. However, the late 14th-century &quot;Pacta conventa&quot; narrates that he was only crowned after he had reached an agreement with twelve leading Croatian noblemen, because the Croats were preparing to defend their kingdom against him by force. Whether this document is a forgery or an authentic source is a subject of scholarly debate. According to the historian Pál Engel, even if the document is a forgery, its content &quot;is concordant with reality in more than one respect&quot; concerning the special status of Croatia throughout the Middle Ages. For instance, in case of a foreign invasion, Croatian noblemen were obliged to fight at their own expense only up to the river Drava, which was considered the border between Croatian territories and Hungary.

In an attempt to prevent an alliance between Coloman and Bohemond I of Antioch, the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos arranged a marriage between his son and heir, John, and Coloman&#x27;s cousin, Piroska, in 1104 or 1105. The alliance with the Byzantine Empire also enabled Coloman to invade Dalmatia in 1105. According to the &quot;Life of the blessed John of Trogir&quot;, he personally commanded his troops besieging Zadar, the most influential among the Dalmatian towns. The siege lasted until Bishop John of Trogir negotiated a treaty between Coloman and the citizens who accepted the king&#x27;s suzerainty. The town of Split likewise surrendered after a short siege, but two other Dalmatian townsTrogir and Šibenikcapitulated without resistance. The &quot;Life of St Christopher the Martyr&quot; also says that a Hungarian fleet subjugated the islands of the Gulf of Kvarner, including Cres, Krk, and Rab, as well as Brač. Thomas the Archdeacon narrates that Coloman granted each Dalmatian town its own &quot;charter of liberties&quot; to secure their loyalty. These liberties included the citizens&#x27; right to freely elect the bishop of their town and their exemption from any tribute payable to the monarch. Following his conquest of Dalmatia, Coloman assumed a new title&quot;King of Hungary, Croatia and Dalmatia&quot;which was first recorded in 1108.

=== Family affairs (1105–1113) ===
Coloman had his four-year-old son Stephen crowned in 1105, which caused Álmos to openly rebel against the king. The duke left Hungary and sought the assistance of Emperor HenryIV. Having realized that the emperor, who was facing a rebellion led by his own son, could not help him, Álmos returned to Hungary in 1106, but then fled to his brother-in-law, Boleslaw III of Poland. With Polish assistance he captured the fortress of Abaújvár in Hungary. Coloman had a meeting with BoleslawIII, and the two monarchs &quot;vowed perpetual friendship and brotherhood&quot;. Without the Polish monarch&#x27;s support, Álmos was forced to yield to Coloman.

Coloman sent envoys to the Council of Guastalla, which had been convoked by Pope Paschal II. In October 1106 the envoys solemnly informed the pope of their king&#x27;s renunciation of his royal prerogative to appoint the prelates of his realms. According to historians Ferenc Makk and Márta Font, without this declaration the Holy See would not have acknowledged Coloman&#x27;s conquest of Dalmatia. During the civil war between BoleslawIII and his brother Zbigniew, Coloman intervened on the former&#x27;s behalf and helped him overcome the latter&#x27;s army in Mazovia in 1107. Coloman also sent Hungarian reinforcements to the Byzantine Emperor AlexiosI Komnenos against Bohemond I of Antioch, who had invaded Byzantine territories in October 1107. After suffering a sound defeat, Bohemond withdrew his troops and acknowledged the emperor&#x27;s suzerainty over the Principality of Antioch in the Treaty of Devol in 1108.

In 1107 or 1108 Álmos made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Coloman decided to take advantage of his absence and seized his duchy. Although Álmos was allowed to keep his own private property, the annexation of his duchy secured Coloman&#x27;s authority in the whole kingdom. After returning from the Holy Land, Álmos set up a monastery at Dömös. On the occasion of its consecration, at which Coloman was also present, Álmos wasfalsely, according to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;accused of trying to assassinate the monarch. Coloman had his brother arrested, but &quot;the most reverend bishops and other well-disposed dignitaries&quot; intervened on Álmos&#x27;s behalf and &quot;thus reconciliation was solemnly sworn&quot; between the king and his brother.

Álmos left for Passau to meet HenryV of Germany. Upon Álmos&#x27;s request, HenryV invaded Hungary and laid siege to Pressburg (Bratislava, Slovakia) in September 1108. At the same time, Duke Svatopluk of Bohemia, who also supported Álmos, made an incursion into the regions north of the Danube. Coloman&#x27;s ally BoleslawIII invaded Bohemia, forcing the Czech duke to withdraw. The emperor&#x27;s attempt to take Pressburg was a total failure, but he persuaded Coloman to forgive Álmos, who was allowed to return to Hungary.

In the same year, Coloman visited Dalmatia and confirmed the privileges of Split, Trogir, and Zadar. He returned to Zadar around 1111 and reaffirmed the Dalmatian towns&#x27; liberties. The Zobor Abbey received two charters of grant from Coloman in 1111 and 1113. The first diploma mentioned a provost in Nyitra (Nitra, Slovakia), but the second charter referred to the bishop of the same town. According to a scholarly theory, the two documents show that Coloman set up the bishopric at Nyitra between 1111 and 1113. These two royal charters also mention a Mercurius as &quot;princeps Ultrasilvanus&quot;, which implies he was the first voivode of Transylvania, but he may have been only an important landowner in the province without holding any specific office. In 1112 Coloman made an incursion into Austria. He either wanted to take revenge for LeopoldIII of Austria&#x27;s participation in the 1108 German campaign against Hungary, or simply to seize booty.

In 1112 Colomanwho had been widowedmarried Euphemia of Kiev, a daughter of Vladimir Monomakh, Prince of Pereyaslavl, in 1112. However, as the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; narrated, the queen &quot;was taken in the sin of adultery&quot; in 1113 or 1114. Coloman soon disowned his wife, sending her back to her father.

=== Last years (1113–1116) ===
In 1113 Duke Boleslaw III of Poland, who had blinded his rebellious brother Zbigniew, causing his death, &quot;undertook a journey of pilgrimage to St.Gilles and St.Stephen the King&quot;, to the Somogyvár Abbey, and to the king&#x27;s shrine at Székesfehérvár in Hungary. Coloman received the Polish monarch cordially in Somogyvár. Shortly afterwardsbetween 1113 and 1115Coloman discovered that Álmos was again conspiring to seize the throne. Having lost his patience, the king had Álmos and Álmos&#x27;s young son Béla blinded to secure a peaceful succession for his own son. On the same occasion, many of his brother&#x27;s partisans were likewise mutilated. According to one of the two versions of these events recorded in the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, the king even ordered that Béla should be castrated but the soldier who was charged with this task refused to execute the order. The chronicle also states that the child was believed to have died after his blinding, but he was actually kept in a monastery for more than a decade.

The fleet of Venice, commanded by Doge Ordelafo Faliero, invaded Dalmatia in August 1115. The Venetians occupied the Dalmatian islands and some of the coastal cities but could not take Zadar and Biograd na Moru. By that time, Coloman was gravely ill. The symptoms recorded in the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; indicate a serious otitis, which caused encephalitis. Before his death, he &quot;instructed his son and his great men that after his death they should take vengeance on Russia for the injury done to him&quot; during his campaign of 1099. Upon his councillor&#x27;s advice, he also had Álmos, who had taken refuge in the monastery of Dömös, imprisoned.

Coloman died on 3 February 1116. According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, &quot;divine vengeance made him drink the bitterness of early death&quot; because of his &quot;shedding of innocent blood&quot; when ordering the punishment of Álmos, Béla, and their partisans. He was the first monarch to be buried near the shrine of StephenI in the Székesfehérvár Cathedral.

== Family ==
Coloman&#x27;s first wife Feliciawho is incorrectly named Busilla in earlier historiographywas the daughter of Count Roger I of Sicily. There is scholarly uncertainty whether her mother was the count&#x27;s first wife Judith of Évreux or his second wife Eremburga of Mortain. The marriage of Coloman and Felicia took place in the spring of 1097. She gave birth to at least three children. According to Font, the eldest child Sophia was born in or before 1100. In 1101 Sophia was followed by twin brothers Stephen and Ladislaus. Felicia&#x27;s death preceded that of Ladislaus, who died in 1112.

Coloman married his second wife Eufemia in the summer of 1112. Born in 1096 or 1097, she was at least 25 years younger than Coloman. She was the daughter of Vladimir II Monomakh, who was Prince of Pereyaslavl at the time of her marriage. After Coloman repudiated her on a charge of adultery, Eufemia fled to Kiev, where she gave birth to a son, Boris, who was never regarded as Coloman&#x27;s son by his Hungarian relatives.

The following family tree presents Coloman&#x27;s ancestors and some of his relatives who are mentioned in the article.



&quot;*Whether Géza&#x27;s first or second wife was his children&#x27;s mother is uncertain.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Late medieval Hungarian chronicles, written under kings descended from Álmos, preserved an unfavorable image of Coloman and his rule. According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, many &quot;evil things were done&quot; in Coloman&#x27;s reign. It states that the saintly LadislausI predicted that Coloman &quot;would shed blood&quot;. Modern historiansincluding Font, László Kontler, and Kristóagree that this negative view was a form of &quot;revenge&quot; by his brother&#x27;s descendants, who persuaded their chroniclers to emphasize Coloman&#x27;s failures and to hide his successes. Earlier sources show that he was not always regarded as an evil and unlucky monarch. In 1105 the abbess of a nunnery in Zadar stated that Coloman had restored the &quot;peace of the land and the sea&quot;. The 13th-century Roger of Torre Maggiore writes that he was &quot;inscribed in the catalogue of saints&quot; along with the members of the Árpád dynasty who were actually canonized. Coloman&#x27;s decrees, which moderated the severity of LadislausI&#x27;s laws, also contradict the chroniclers&#x27; reports of his bloodthirsty nature. The preamble to his decrees described him as &quot;the most Christian King Columban&quot;, who is &quot;endowed with the artless grace of a dove and with all discernment of the virtues&quot;.

Coloman&#x27;s statesmanship is appreciated in modern historiography. According to Kontler, &quot;it was ... under Coloman&#x27;s reign that the medieval Hungarian state became consummate and acquired its final structure&quot;. Font and Kristó write that Coloman&#x27;s laws governed his kingdom without modifications for more than a century, even under monarchs hostile towards his memory. Likewise, coinage in Hungary followed the pattern established by Coloman&#x27;s small denars throughout the 12th century.

His contemporaries Pope Urban II and Gallus Anonymus were aware of Coloman&#x27;s &quot;uncommon erudition&quot;. According to the chronicles, the Hungarians called him &quot;Cunues&quot; or &quot;Qunwes&quot;the Learned or the Book-Lover&quot;because of the books he owned&quot;. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; says that Coloman &quot;read the canonical hours like a bishop&quot; in his books. According to Kristó, Coloman&#x27;s court was a center of learning and literature. Bishop Hartvik compiled his &quot;Life of King Stephen of Hungary&quot; under Coloman. Kristó writes that it is probable that the &quot;Lesser Legend&quot; of Saint Gerard of Csanád (Cenad, Romania) was also written during Coloman&#x27;s reign. Historians also attribute the first compilation of Hungarian historical records to his efforts.

<text>In computer programming, reusability describes the quality of a software asset that affects its ability to be used in a software system for which is was &quot;not&quot; specifically designed. An asset that is easy to reuse and provides utility is considered to have high reusability. A related concept, leverage involves modifying an existing asset to meet system requirements.

The ability to reuse can be viewed as the ability to build larger things from smaller parts, and to identify commonality among the parts. Reusability is often a required characteristic of platform software. Reusability brings several aspects to software development that do not need to be considered when reusability is not required.

Reusability may be impacted by various DevOps aspects including: build, packaging, distribution, installation, configuration, deployment, maintenance and upgrade. If these aspects are not considered, software may seem to be reusable based on its design, but may not be reusable in practice.

Many reuse design principles were developed at the WISR workshops. Although lacking consensus candidate design features for software reuse include:
* Adaptable
* Brief; small size
* Consistency
* Correctness
* Extensibility
* Fast
* Flexible
* Generic
* Localization of volatile/changeable design assumptions
* Modularity
* Orthogonality
* Simple; low complexity
* Stability under changing requirements

<text>Adélie Land ( ) or Adélie Coast is a claimed territory of France located on the continent of Antarctica. It stretches from a portion of the Southern Ocean coastline all the way inland to the South Pole. France has administered it as one of five districts of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands since 1955 and applied the Antarctic Treaty System rules since 1961. Article 4 of the Antarctic Treaty deals with territorial claims, and although it does not renounce or diminish any preexisting claims to sovereignty, it also does not prejudice the position of contracting parties in their recognition or non-recognition of territorial sovereignty. France has had a permanent station in Adélie Land since 9 April 1950.

== Geography ==
Adélie Land lies between 136° E (near Pourquoi Pas Point at ) and 142° E (near Point Alden at ), with a shore length of about and with its inland part extending as a sector of a circle about toward the South Pole. Adélie Land has borders with the Australian Antarctic Territory both on the east and on the west, namely on Clarie Land (part of Wilkes Land) in the west, and George V Land in the east. Additionally, it is the only territory claimed within French Southern and Antarctic Lands that is not an island.

Its total land area, mostly covered with glaciers, is estimated to be .

The coast of Adélie Land is known for its katabatic winds which push snow and sea ice away from the coast. In a 1915 Science Magazine volume, it was named the &quot;stormiest spot on the face of earth&quot;.

== History ==
The coast of Adélie Land was discovered in January 1840 by the French explorer Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville (1790–1842) who named it after his wife, Adèle. This is the basis of the French claim to this Antarctic land. The first French research station, Port Martin, was built in 1950. It was destroyed by a fire in 1952, and replaced by Dumont d&#x27;Urville Station in 1956. Charcot Station was a French inland base built which was occupied from 1957 to 1960.

Cap Prud&#x27;Homme Camp, an Italian-French base, opened in 1994. Prud&#x27;Homme and Dumont d&#x27;Urville are the only currently remaining active stations.

== Research stations ==
=== Port Martin and Base Marret (1950–52) ===

The site of Port Martin was discovered during a French Antarctic Expedition under on 18 January 1950. Liotard, along with 11 men, established the station on 9 April 1950 at . Port Martin housed a winter population of 11 in 1950–51 and 17 in 1951–52. A crew under Mario Marret built a temporary secondary base in January 1952: Base Marret on Petrel Island. Port Martin was destroyed by a fire during the night of 23–24 January 1952. All of the inhabitants were safely evacuated, and they overwintered at Base Marret. Only the ancillary buildings of Port Martin were not destroyed by the fire and they have remained mostly untouched since.

=== Dumont d&#x27;Urville Station (1956–present) ===

The Dumont d&#x27;Urville Station is a year-round French research base located at . The station is large and houses a summer population of 120 and a winter population of around 30. It was built on 12 January 1956 for the International Geophysical Year of 1957–58. Initially intended to be a temporary station, it was expanded and continually occupied. Like Base Marret, the station is located on Petrel Island, which is 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from the mainland. The station&#x27;s research includes ecology, marine biology, glaciology, meteorology and more. In the documentary, &quot;March of the Penguins&quot; (2005), Dumont d&#x27;Urville Station was the main filming location.

=== Charcot Station (1957–60) ===
 was a French inland base located on the Antarctic ice sheet at from the coast and from Dumont d&#x27;Urville Station, at an elevation of about . The station, built for the International Geophysical Year of 1957–58, paid homage to Jean-Baptiste Charcot), and was occupied from January 1957 through 1960 housing solely three men.

The base was composed of a main body of 24 square metres (the &quot;barrack&quot;) which consisted of semicylindrical sections of sheet metal assembled end to end. This form was planned to best withstand the snow pressure accumulated on it. Horizontal galleries were connected to house scientific measurement devices, while a vertical air conduit opened a few metres above the snow level provided ventilation.

=== Robert Guillard Station (1994–present) ===
Robert Guillard Station known as Cap Prud&#x27;Homme () is an Italian-French camp, opened in 1994, located on the coast of the Antarctic ice sheet, in Adélie Land, about from Petrel Island, where the French Dumont d&#x27;Urville Station is. All the supplies and equipment for the Italian-French Concordia Station are transported by a combined convoy of up to 7 Caterpillar tractors from Cap Prud&#x27;Homme, with Kässbohrer trailblazers and a team of up to 9 people; each convoy transports an average of 150 tons of payload.

== Wildlife ==

Part of the Pointe Géologie Archipelago in Adélie Land is protected by the Antarctic Specially Protected Area 120. In 2016, a study predicted that an Adélie penguin colony located in Cape Dennison in Commonwealth Bay might be subject to extinction. In 2010, a fallen glacier blocked the flow of a river and caused sea ice to overflow to the rocky surface that Adélie penguin requires to nest.

Before 2017, an estimated 18,000 pairs of Adélie penguin resided in the Adélie Land. However, in 2017, an insurgence of sea ice forced the penguins to travel further to reach the sea. Due to this, nearly all of the newborn penguins had died of starvation and exhaustion. The Dumont d&#x27;Urville Station is in proximity to Adélie penguins, emperor penguins, and seals.

<doc id="346558" wikidata="Q7339239" url="?curid=346558" title="Roach bait">
<text>Roach bait is a modern pest control used for the extermination of cockroaches at indoor locations. The effectiveness of this method of pest control exploits the cannibalistic and coprophagic tendencies of cockroaches.

== Mechanism ==
Cockroaches live in nests. Therefore, killing a few roaches that happen to wander into a trap is an inadequate means of controlling the pest. Even if all adult roaches outside the nest are killed, some live eggs will remain in the nest and eventually hatch, leading to exponential growth.

==Cockroach infestations==
The main problem with controlling infestations of cockroaches is ensuring that enough insecticide gets to a sufficiently large proportion of the population to effect control. Cockroach infestations have been treated with insecticidal sprays, dusts, gels, sand baits, etc. Cockroach bait may consist of simple poisons, killing from direct feeding only, to the latest insecticides which use delayed transferred toxic action, which can reach a sufficiently high proportion of the cockroach population to achieve effective control in a short period of time.

===Secondary transmission of toxic baits===
Cockroaches eat the feces of other roaches and they feed on each other. After consuming a lethal dose of a residual bait insecticide known to have delayed toxicant activity, cockroaches return to the harborage where they excrete feces. The insecticide-laden feces, fluids and eventual carcass, can contain sufficient residual pesticide to kill others in the same nesting site. As the roach staggers around for hours or even days, it infects other roaches in the nest, with toxicant transfer through feces, which then go on to infect others. This secondary transmission occurs through direct contact with, or ingestion of, traces of baits dispersed in the environment by contaminated cockroaches. These traces were either deposited by “trampling” in the environment or on dead contaminated cockroaches.
The cascading effect goes on to wipe out whole colonies from indirect exposure by contact with the corpses, feces, or harborages of cockroaches previously exposed.

Such nests, when contaminated with sufficient residual pesticide via feces, secretions, exuviae, or corpses provide an important reservoir of pesticide, which would be available to infect other species. Residual pesticides by virtue of their efficacy against cockroaches, their deployment in secure bait stations, and the way in which the active toxicant is transmitted to cockroaches that have not fed on the baits, offer an effective and environmentally compatible way of controlling cockroaches.

===Active ingredients===
An active ingredient (AI) is the substance in a pesticide that is biologically active.
To control colonies the roach bait may contain the active ingredients Fipronil .05% or Hydramethylnon 2%. Also there are indoxacarb versions. Residual pesticides turn the infected cockroaches and their fluids into bait themselves. These slow-acting poisons, when mixed with a bait, allow the poisoned insect time to return to the colony or harborage and infect others.

====Fipronil====
The active ingredient Fipronil .05% disrupts the insect central nervous system, leading to the cockroach’s death in 6 to 24 hours. Cockroaches nestling together transfer insecticide to one another by touch. Fipronil acts as an insecticide with contact, and stomach action. It is sparingly soluble in water and is stable at normal temperatures for one year. Fipronil is an extremely active molecule and is a potent disruptor of the insect central nervous system.

Fipronil bait is more effective and kills faster than Hydramethylnon. Mortality rates caused by secondary transmission are higher for Fipronil bait than for Hydramethylnon bait. Fipronil is a &quot;Group C - possible human carcinogen&quot; and has caused tumors in rats, particularly thyroid tumors.

====Hydramethylnon====
The active ingredient Hydramethylnon 2% used as an insecticide in the form of bait for cockroaches leading to death in 2–4 days. Hydramethylnon inhibits mitochondrial energy production and has delayed action, with death generally not occurring for at least 24 hrs after consumption of the bait. After a single feeding, there are no immediate symptoms of poisoning, but within a few hours, the insects become lethargic and stop eating. This condition progresses until the insects die within 24 to 72 hours.

Hydramethylnon kills insects by disrupting energy production in their cells. Hydramethylnon is a slow-acting stomach poison (delayed toxicity) that does not need to be eaten to be effective. It is toxic to cockroaches both by topical application and by ingestion. Hydramethylnon residues are much less active against cockroaches by contact than by ingestion. A slow-acting poison is desirable, so they live long enough to return to the colony to share it with other cockroaches. In this way cockroaches that have eaten Hydramethylnon infect other cockroaches that have not had direct exposure to the baits. Hydramethylnon is known to cause cancer in rats, particularly uterine and adrenal tumours and lung cancer.

====Indoxacarb====
The Indoxacarb pesticide while slightly more toxic, is professional grade and more effective than previously mentioned roach baits.

===Boric acid===
Boric acid is not a bait in the dry form, but rather broadcast as a dust, that is both a toxin and a desiccant. Boric acid is often formulated into a paste. Roach attractants are mixed with the boric acid. It is similar in consistency to toothpaste.

Boric acid roach baits consist of a proprietary blend of attractants. These products are often sold at exterminator or pest supply houses. They are sold at most hardware stores and some big box home improvement or retail stores. Boric acid is harmful if taken in large quantities to humans, children and pets. 

==Bait placement==
Cockroaches tend to live in groups with fellow cockroaches in the darkest shelters available. They instinctively choose darker over more illuminated areas. Cockroaches will settle in if a place is dimly lit and well populated, and will use their antennae to feel whether other cockroaches are present.

The best way to determine the extent of cockroach activity, and hiding places is to look for them at night. Cockroaches are nocturnal, the few that are seen by day were likely forced out by overcrowding; a possible sign of severe infestation. As such, it is more likely to come across cockroach feces (which look similar to black pepper) than actual cockroaches themselves. Roaches prefer crowds and darkness. Simple minded, they use just two pieces of information to decide where to go. They go where the most cockroaches are, and where it is darkest. They act as a group, and they tend to stay together.

For baiting to be effective, proper placement and techniques are a must. Baits should be used as close to the nest as possible. A bait just 50 cm further away from a nest can reduce the amount of bait eaten by half. If the same amount of bait is used to cover two areas, the area with the greater number of traps will have most bait eaten. One should avoid spraying insecticides in baited areas, as that can cause the bait to become contaminated, thus the roaches would likely avoid consuming it. Baits, gels and Insect Growth Regulators can be useful in many cases.

Bait placed in the open, away from a wall, is essentially non-effective because cockroaches are less likely to locate it. Twice as much food per day was consumed when it was next to a nest rather than 50 cm away. A small quantity of bait in many locations provides better control than large quantities in a few locations.

== Cockroach Gels ==
Cockroach gels are a type of roach bait that is becoming increasingly popular due to their ease of use and effectiveness. Gels are typically applied in small dabs in areas where cockroaches are active, such as kitchens, bathrooms, and behind appliances. The gel contains a food attractant that entices cockroaches to feed on it. Once ingested, the gel acts as a slow-acting poison, killing the cockroach within a few days or weeks.

One of the main advantages of cockroach gels is that they are non-repellent. This means that cockroaches will not be deterred from feeding on the gel, even if they have encountered it before. This is in contrast to some other types of roach bait, such as sprays or baits that contain a repellent ingredient. As a result, cockroach gels can be more effective in eliminating an entire cockroach infestation.

Another advantage of cockroach gels is that they are relatively safe for use around children and pets. The gel is contained in a bait station or applicator, which helps to prevent accidental ingestion by humans or animals. Additionally, the active ingredients in cockroach gels are typically less toxic than those used in other types of roach bait.

Here are some of the different types of cockroach gels available:

* Fipronil gels: Fipronil is a common active ingredient in cockroach gels. It works by interfering with the cockroach&#x27;s nervous system.
* Abamectin gels: Abamectin is another common active ingredient in cockroach gels. It works by paralyzing the cockroach&#x27;s muscles.
* Borate gels: Borate gels are a type of non-repellent gel that is often used as a supplement to other roach control methods. Boric acid dehydrates cockroaches and disrupts their digestive system.

When using cockroach gels, it is important to follow the instructions on the product label carefully. This will help to ensure that the gel is applied safely and effectively.

<text>Multimethodology or multimethod research includes the use of more than one method of data collection or research in a research study or set of related studies. Mixed methods research is more specific in that it includes the mixing of qualitative and quantitative data, methods, methodologies, and/or paradigms in a research study or set of related studies. One could argue that mixed methods research is a special case of multimethod research. Another applicable, but less often used label, for multi or mixed research is methodological pluralism. All of these approaches to professional and academic research emphasize that monomethod research can be improved through the use of multiple data sources, methods, research methodologies, perspectives, standpoints, and paradigms.

The term &quot;multimethodology&quot; was used starting in the 1980s and in the 1989 book &quot;Multimethod Research: A Synthesis of Styles&quot; by John Brewer and Albert Hunter. During the 1990s and currently, the term &quot;mixed methods research&quot; has become more popular for this research movement in the behavioral, social, business, and health sciences. This pluralistic research approach has been gaining in popularity since the 1980s.

==Multi and mixed methods research designs==
There are four broad classes of research studies that are currently being labeled &quot;mixed methods research&quot;:
# &quot;Quantitatively driven approaches/designs&quot; in which the research study is, at its core, a quantitative study with qualitative data/method added to supplement and improve the quantitative study by providing an added value and deeper, wider, and fuller or more complex answers to research questions; quantitative quality criteria are emphasized but high quality qualitative data also must be collected and analyzed;
# &quot;Qualitatively driven approaches/designs&quot; in which the research study is, at its core, a qualitative study with quantitative data/method added to supplement and improve the qualitative study by providing an added value and deeper, wider, and fuller or more complex answers to research questions; qualitative quality criteria are emphasized but high quality quantitative data also must be collected and analyzed;
# &quot;Interactive or equal status designs&quot; in which the research study equally emphasizes (interactively and through integration) quantitative and qualitative data, methods, methodologies, and paradigms. This third design is often done through the use of a team composed of an expert in quantitative research, an expert in qualitative research, and an expert in mixed methods research to help with dialogue and continual integration. In this type of mixed study, quantitative and qualitative and mixed methods quality criteria are emphasized. This use of multiple quality criteria is seen in the concept of &quot;multiple validities legitimation&quot;. Here is a definition of this important type of validity or legitimation: Multiple validities legitimation &quot;refers to the extent to which the mixed methods researcher successfully addresses and resolves all relevant validity types, including the quantitative and qualitative validity types discussed earlier in this chapter as well as the mixed validity dimensions. In other words, the researcher must identify and address all of the relevant validity issues facing a particular research study. Successfully addressing the pertinent validity issues will help researchers produce the kinds of inferences and meta-inferences that should be made in mixed research&quot;(Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2014; page 311).
# &quot;Mixed priority designs&quot; in which the principal study results derive from the integration of qualitative and quantitative data during analysis.

==Desirability==
The case for multimethodology or mixed methods research as a strategy for intervention and/or research is based on four observations:
# Narrow views of the world are often misleading, so approaching a subject from different perspectives or paradigms may help to gain a holistic or more truthful worldview.
# There are different levels of social research (&quot;i.e.&quot;: biological, cognitive, social, &quot;etc.&quot;), and different methodologies may have particular strengths with respect to one of these levels. Using more than one should help to get a clearer picture of the social world and make for more adequate explanations.
# Many existing practices already combine methodologies to solve particular problems, yet they have not been theorised sufficiently.
# Multimethodology fits well with pragmatism.

==Feasibility==
There are also some hazards to multimethodological or mixed methods research approaches. Some of these problems include:
# Many paradigms are at odds with each other. However, once the understanding of the difference is present, it can be an advantage to see many sides, and possible solutions may present themselves.
# Multimethod and mixed method research can be undertaken from many paradigmatic perspectives, including pragmatism, dialectical pluralism, critical realism, and constructivism. 
# Cultural issues affect world views and analyzability. Knowledge of a new paradigm is not enough to overcome potential biases; it must be learned through practice and experience.
# People have cognitive abilities that predispose them to particular paradigms. Quantitative research requires skills of data-analysis and several techniques of statistic reasoning, while qualitative research is rooted in in-depth observation, comparative thinking, interpretative skills and interpersonal ability. None of the approaches is easier to master than the other, and both require specific expertise, ability and skills.

== Pragmatism and mixed methods ==
Pragmatism allows for the integration of qualitative and quantitative methods as loosely coupled systems to support mixed methods research. On the one hand, quantitative research is characterized by randomized controlled trials, research questions inspired by literature review gap, generalizability, validity, and reliability. On the other, qualitative research is characterized by socially constructed realities and lived experiences. Pragmatism reconciles these differences an integrates quantitative and qualitative research as loosely coupled systems, where &quot;open systems interact with each other at the point of their boundaries.&quot;

===History of Pragmatism in Multi/Mixed Methods Research===
Developed as a philosophical method to solve problems towards the end of the nineteenth century, pragmatism is attributed to the work of philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce. For Peirce, research is conducted and interpreted from the eye of the beholder, as a practical approach to investigating social affairs. He sees science as a communal affair leading to single truths that are arrived at from multiple perspectives. For Peirce, the research conclusions are not as important as how these conclusions are reached. Focus is on answering the research question while allowing the methods to emerge in the process. Peirce pragmatism and its approach to research support qualitatively driven mixed methods studies.

John Dewey extends both, &quot;Peirce pragmatic method and (William) James&#x27; radical empiricism (and approach to experience) by application to social and political problems.&quot; His philosophical pragmatism takes an interdisciplinary approach, where the divide between quantitative and qualitative research represents an obstacle to solving a problem. In Dewey&#x27;s pragmatism, success is measured by the outcome, where the outcome is the reason to engage in research. Live experiences constitute reality, were individual lived experiences form a continuum by the interaction of subjective (internal) and objective (external) conditions. In Dewey&#x27;s continuum of experiences, no experience lives on its own, it is influenced by the experiences that preceded it, and influences those that will follow it. His approach to knowledge is open-minded, and inquire is central to his epistemology.

Following Dewey, quantitatively driven research methods dominated until 1979, when Richard Rorty revived pragmatism. Rorty introduces his own ideas into pragmatism which includes the importance of culture, beliefs, and context. He shifts from understanding how things are to how they could be, and introduces the idea that &quot;justification is audience dependent, and pretty much any justification finds a receptive audience&quot; As Rorty explains, research success is peer dependent, not peer group neutral. From his perspective, MMR is not simply the merging of quantitative and qualitative research, but a third camp with its own peers and supporters.

=== Pragmatic philosophical positions ===
Multiple pragmatic philosophical stands may be used to justify pragmatism as a paradigm when conducting mixed methods research (MMR). A research paradigm provides a framework based on what constitutes and how knowledge is formed. Pragmatism as a philosophy may aid researchers in positioning themselves somewhere in the spectrum between qualitatively driven and quantitatively driven methods. The following philosophical stands can help address the debate between the use of qualitative and quantitative methods, and to ground quantitatively, qualitatively, or equal-status driven MMR.

====Radical empiricism====
Radical empiricism, as articulated by William James, takes reality as a function of our ongoing experiences, constantly changing at the individual level. James emphasizes that reality is not predetermined, and individual free will and chance matter. These ideas fit well with qualitative research emphasizing lived experiences. James also finds the truth in empirical and objectives facts, merging the divide between qualitative and quantitative research. However, James points out that no truth is independent of the thinker. James&#x27; brand of pragmatism may be used by researchers conducting qualitatively and equal-status driven MMR.

====Dialectical Pluralism====
Dialectical pluralism is a form of pragmatism that emphasizes intentionally drawing from multiple approaches to conducting research and developing knowledge. The multiple approaches being taken need not agree or converge with one another. Instead, the researcher using dialectical pluralism in the conduct of a mixed-method study may tack back and forth between models and perspectives in order to develop insight.

====Realism and Critical Realism====

Realists and critical realists take the perspective that the world exists independently of our observation and interpretation of it; critical realism goes beyond this to assert that multiple interpretations of the world are likely. Like dialectical pluralism, realist paradigms in the context of pragmatic multi/mixed-methods research emphasize the idea that multiple approaches to knowledge are expected and can be treated as complementary. In contrast to a more strict positivist approach, critical realism sees causality as embedded in the details of a situation and social processes that surround an event.

====Transformative-Emancipatory====
Transformative and emancipatory paradigms emphasize a commitment on the part of the researcher to social justice, as in critical race theory. Researchers conducting multi-method or mixed-methods research within this paradigm tend to orient to issues of &quot;power, privilege, and inequity.&quot;

==In contrast to quantitative and qualitative methodologies==
One major similarity between mixed methodologies and qualitative and quantitative taken separately is that researchers need to maintain focus on the original purpose behind their methodological choices. A major difference between the two, however, is the way some authors differentiate the two, proposing that there is logic inherent in one that is different from the other. Creswell (2009) points out that in a quantitative study the researcher starts with a problem statement, moving on to the hypothesis and null hypothesis, through the instrumentation into a discussion of data collection, population, and data analysis. Creswell proposes that for a qualitative study the flow of logic begins with the purpose for the study, moves through the research questions discussed as data collected from a smaller group and then voices how they will be analysed.

A research &quot;strategy&quot; is a procedure for achieving a particular intermediary research objective — such as sampling, data collection, or data analysis. We may therefore speak of sampling strategies or data analysis strategies. The use of multiple strategies to enhance construct validity (a form of methodological triangulation) is now routinely advocated by methodologists. In short, mixing or integrating research strategies (qualitative and/or quantitative) in any and all research undertaking is now considered a common feature of good research.

A research &quot;approach&quot; refers to an integrated set of research principles and general procedural guidelines. Approaches are broad, holistic (but general) methodological guides or roadmaps that are associated with particular research motives or analytic interests. Two examples of analytic interests are population frequency distributions and prediction. Examples of research approaches include experiments, surveys, correlational studies, ethnographic research, and phenomenological inquiry. Each approach is ideally suited to addressing a particular analytic interest. For instance, experiments are ideally suited to addressing nomothetic explanations or probable cause; surveys — population frequency descriptions, correlations studies — predictions; ethnography — descriptions and interpretations of cultural processes; and phenomenology — descriptions of the essence of phenomena or lived experiences.

In a &quot;single approach design&quot; (&quot;SAD&quot;)(also called a &quot;monomethod design&quot;) only one analytic interest is pursued. In a &quot;mixed or multiple approach design (MAD)&quot; two or more analytic interests are pursued. Note: a multiple approach design may include entirely &quot;quantitative&quot; approaches such as combining a survey and an experiment; or entirely &quot;qualitative&quot; approaches such as combining an ethnographic and a phenomenological inquiry, and a mixed approach design includes a mixture of the above (&quot;e.g.&quot;, a mixture of quantitative and qualitative data, methods, methodologies, and/or paradigms).

A word of caution about the term &quot;multimethodology&quot;. It has become quite common place to use the terms &quot;method&quot; and &quot;methodology&quot; as synonyms (as is the case with the above entry). However, there are convincing philosophical reasons for distinguishing the two. &quot;Method&quot; connotes a way of doing something — a procedure (such as a method of data collection). &quot;Methodology&quot; connotes a discourse about methods — &quot;i.e.&quot;, a discourse about the adequacy and appropriateness of particular combination of research principles and procedures. The terms methodology and biology share a common suffix &quot;&quot;logy&quot;.&quot; Just as bio-&quot;logy&quot; is a discourse about life — all kinds of life; so too, methodo-&quot;logy&quot; is a discourse about methods — all kinds of methods. It seems unproductive, therefore, to speak of multi-biologies or of multi-methodologies. It is very productive, however, to speak of multiple biological perspectives or of multiple methodological perspectives.

<text>The BBC Third Programme was a national radio station produced and broadcast from 1946 until 1967, when it was replaced by BBC Radio 3. It first went on the air on 29 September 1946 and became one of the leading cultural and intellectual forces in Britain, playing an important role in disseminating the arts, broadcasting music (mainly classical), plays, documentary features and talks. It was the BBC&#x27;s third national radio network, the other two being the Home Service (mainly speech-based) and the Light Programme, principally devoted to light entertainment and music.

==History==

When it started in 1946, the Third Programme broadcast for six hours each evening from 6.00 pm to midnight, although its output was cut to just 24 hours a week from October 1957, with the early part of weekday evenings being given over to educational programming (known as &quot;Network Three&quot;). The frequencies were also used during daytime hours to broadcast complete ball-by-ball commentary on test match cricket, under the title &quot;Test Match Special&quot;.

The Third&#x27;s existence was controversial from the beginning, partly because of perceived &quot;elitism&quot; – it was sometimes criticised for broadcasting programmes of &quot;two dons talking&quot; – and also for the cost of its output relative to a small listener reach. Its existence was against the corporation&#x27;s founding principles, as Reith himself had during his time at the BBC been against segmenting audiences by splitting programming genres across different networks. From the start, though, it had prominent supporters: the Education Secretary in the Attlee government, Ellen Wilkinson, spoke rather optimistically of creating a &quot;third programme nation&quot;. When it faced those 1957 cuts, the Third Programme Defence Society was formed and its leaders included T. S. Eliot, Albert Camus, and Sir Laurence Olivier.

This situation continued until the launch on 22 March 1965 of the BBC Music Programme, which began regular daily broadcasts of classical music (with some interruptions for live sports coverage) on the Network Three / Third Programme frequencies between 7.00 am and 6.30 pm on weekdays, 8.00 am and 12.30 pm on Saturdays, and 8.00 am and 5.00 pm on Sundays. The Third Programme continued as a distinct evening service, and this continued to be the case for a short while after the inception of BBC Radio 3 on 30 September 1967, before all the elements of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;third network&quot; were finally absorbed into Radio 3 with rebranding effect from Saturday 4 April 1970.

==Output and programming==
The network was broadly cultural, a Leavisite experiment dedicated to the discerning or &quot;high-brow&quot; listener from an educated, minority audience. Its founders&#x27; aims were seen as promoting &quot;something fundamental to our civilisation&quot; and as contributing to &quot;the refinement of society&quot;. Its musical output provided a wide range of serious classical music and live concerts, as well as contemporary composers and jazz; popular classical music such as Beethoven, Mozart and Tchaikovsky primarily remained on the Home Service until 1964. Voice formed a much higher proportion of its output than the later Radio 3, with specially commissioned plays, poetry readings, talks and documentaries. Nationally known intellectuals such as Bertrand Russell and Isaiah Berlin on philosophy or Fred Hoyle on cosmology were regular contributors.

The network became a principal patron of the arts, within commissioned many music works for broadcast by the BBC Music Department, playing an important role in the development of the career of composers such as Benjamin Britten. Particularly notable were its drama productions, including the radio plays of Samuel Beckett, Henry Reed (the Hilda Tablet plays), Harold Pinter, Wyndham Lewis, Joe Orton and Dylan Thomas, whose &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; was written specially for the programme. Philip O&#x27;Connor discovered Quentin Crisp in his radio interviews in 1963. The series &quot;Inventions for Radio&quot; aired in 1964 and 1965, with sound collages by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Martin Esslin, BBC Director of Drama (Radio), was associated with the network&#x27;s productions of European drama, and Douglas Cleverdon with its productions of poetry and radio plays.

The Third Programme&#x27;s contribution to contemporary poetry and criticism was significant, under producers and presenters such as John Wain, Ludovic Kennedy, George MacBeth and Patrick Dickinson. It promoted young writers such as Philip Larkin and Kingsley Amis, as well as the &quot;difficult&quot; work of David Jones and Laura Riding. The Third Programme was for many years the single largest source of copyright payments to poets.

The decision to close down the Third Programme was opposed by many within the BBC, some of them senior figures. Within the music division, a &quot;BBC rebellion&quot; gathered force, with its most vocal members including Hans Keller and Robert Simpson. Ultimately however, the attempt to prevent the culture-conscious Third being replaced by what Keller called &quot;a daytime music station&quot; proved unsuccessful.

<text>The German Communist Party (, ) is a communist party in Germany. The DKP supports far-left positions and was an observer member of the European Left before leaving in February 2016.

==History==
The DKP considered itself a reconstitution of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), which had been banned by the Federal Constitutional Court in 1956 for its aggressively militant opposition to the West German constitution. The new party was formed on 25 September 1968.

The foundation was preceded by talks between former KPD functionaries and Gustav Heinemann, the West German minister of justice, who explained to them that while a refounding of a banned party was not legally possible, Communists were free to form an entirely new party. Even though the close links to the banned KPD made the new party vulnerable to be declared illegal, no such declaration was requested by the German government as West German authorities were liberalizing the attitude towards the communist bloc and East Germany in particular.

The DKP remained on the political fringe, never winning more than 0.3% of the total votes in federal elections. It had relatively greater local support in the 1970s: it achieved up to 2.2% of the vote in Hamburg, 3.1% in Bremen and 2.7% in the Saarland, yet still not enough to enter any Landtags. However, the party enjoyed some success in municipal elections, two patterns of municipalities can be identified in which the DKP was able to win seats: on the one hand working-class residential communities with a long left-wing tradition such as Bottrop in the Ruhr area or Mörfelden-Walldorf in Hesse, and on the other university towns such as Marburg or Tübingen. Following German reunification, the DKP entered a steady decline.

The DKP received national public attention in early 2008 when Christel Wegner, elected to the state parliament of Lower Saxony on the list of the Left Party as the first DKP member of a state parliament, allegedly endorsed the Berlin Wall, the Stasi and other aspects of the East German state in an interview. This caused embarrassment to the national Left Party leadership. Despite denying that she made the controversial statements (at least in the form that was reported), she was expelled from the Left Party faction a few days later.

On March 2 and 3, 2013, the 20th party congress of the DKP took place in Mörfelden-Walldorf (Hesse). The election for the party chairmanship between the incumbent Bettina Jürgensen and her challenger Patrik Köbele came down to a tight contestafter a years-long dispute over direction within the party. Köbele won the election and wanted to position the party as “more militant and revolutionary, re-emphasizing the class struggle, class consciousness and the vanguard role of the Communist Party”. “The distance to those forces that prefer reforms within the existing social system to anti-imperialist revolutionary rhetoric without social backing as a short-term goal will increase,” Köbele emphasized when he took office.

The DKP ended its observer status in the Party of the European Left on 27 February 2016.

The group around the former chairpersons Bettina Jürgensen, Heinz Stehr and the “architect of the reform course” in the party, Leo Meyer, organized itself in the “Communist Network” and in the association “Marxist Left” (MaLi). MaLi is the official “partner movement” of the European Left Party.

In the course of the internal discussion about the party&#x27;s orientation in relation to the anti-monopolistic strategy (AMS), some, mainly young members left the party and the youth organization SDAJ because they rejected the AMS. They initially founded the group “What next?”, from which the Communist Organization (KO) emerged in mid-2018 and the Communist Party (KP) emerged in 2024.

==Media==
The party publishes a weekly newspaper, &quot;Unsere Zeit&quot; ().

<text>A Fossil-Lagerstätte (, from &quot;&quot; &#x27;storage, lair&#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;place&#x27;; plural &quot;Lagerstätten&quot;) is a sedimentary deposit that exhibits extraordinary fossils with exceptional preservation—sometimes including preserved soft tissues. These formations may have resulted from carcass burial in an anoxic environment with minimal bacteria, thus delaying the decomposition of both gross and fine biological features until long after a durable impression was created in the surrounding matrix. &quot;Fossil-Lagerstätten&quot; span geological time from the Neoproterozoic era to the present.

Worldwide, some of the best examples of near-perfect fossilization are the Cambrian Maotianshan shales and Burgess Shale, the Ordovician Soom Shale, the Silurian Waukesha Biota, the Devonian Hunsrück Slates and Gogo Formation, the Carboniferous Mazon Creek, the Triassic Madygen Formation, the Jurassic Posidonia Shale and Solnhofen Limestone, the Cretaceous Yixian, Santana, &amp; Agua Nueva formations and the Tanis Fossil Site, the Eocene Fur Formation, Green River Formation, Messel Formation &amp; Monte Bolca, the Miocene Foulden Maar and Ashfall Fossil Beds, the Pliocene Gray Fossil Site, and the Pleistocene Naracoorte Caves &amp; La Brea Tar Pits.

==Types==
Palaeontologists distinguish two kinds:
# Konzentrat-Lagerstätten (concentration &quot;Lagerstätten&quot;) are deposits with a particular &quot;concentration&quot; of disarticulated organic hard parts, such as a bone bed. These &quot;Lagerstätten&quot; are less spectacular than the more famous &quot;Konservat-Lagerstätten&quot;. Their contents invariably display a large degree of time averaging, as the accumulation of bones in the absence of other sediment takes some time. Deposits with a high concentration of fossils that represent an &quot;in situ&quot; community, such as reefs or oyster beds, are not considered &quot;Lagerstätten&quot;.
# Konservat-Lagerstätten (conservation &quot;Lagerstätten&quot;) are deposits known for the exceptional preservation of fossilized organisms or traces. The individual taphonomy of the fossils varies with the sites. Conservation &quot;Lagerstätten&quot; are crucial in elucidating important moments in the history and evolution of life. For example, the Burgess Shale of British Columbia is associated with the Cambrian explosion, and the Solnhofen limestone with the earliest known bird, &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;.

==Preservation==
&quot;Konservat-Lagerstätten&quot; preserve lightly sclerotized and soft-bodied organisms or traces of organisms that are not otherwise preserved in the usual shelly and bony fossil record; thus, they offer more complete records of ancient biodiversity and behavior and enable some reconstruction of the palaeoecology of ancient aquatic communities. In 1986, Simon Conway Morris calculated only about 14% of genera in the Burgess Shale had possessed biomineralized tissues in life. The affinities of the shelly elements of conodonts were mysterious until the associated soft tissues were discovered near Edinburgh, Scotland, in the Granton Lower Oil Shale of the Carboniferous. Information from the broader range of organisms found in &quot;Lagerstätten&quot; have contributed to recent phylogenetic reconstructions of some major metazoan groups. &quot;Lagerstätten&quot; seem to be temporally autocorrelated, perhaps because global environmental factors such as climate might affect their deposition.

A number of taphonomic pathways may produce &quot;Konservat-Lagerstätten&quot;:
* Phosphatization (replacing soft tissues with phosphate, such as Orsten-type and Doushantuo-type preservations).
* Silicification (replacing or entombing soft tissues with silica, such as petrified wood or Bitter Springs-type preservation).
* Kerogenization (soft tissues converted into inert carbonaceous films, as found in Burgess Shale-type preservation).
* Aluminosilification (replacing or coating soft tissues with films of aluminosilicate minerals).
* Pyritization (replacing soft tissues with pyrite, such as the exquisite detail found in Beecher&#x27;s trilobite-type preservation).
* Calcification (replacing or soft tissues with calcite minerals).
* Siderite or calcite nodules (chemicals released by decaying soft tissue modify the surrounding sediment into a siderite concretion or coal ball encasing the fossil, as found in the Mazon Creek fossil beds).
* Rapid sediment cementation (impressions of soft tissue preserved through casts and molds in the surrounding sediment, such as Ediacaran-type preservation facilitated by microbial mats).
* Amber (soft tissues encased in hardened tree resin).
The identification of a fossil site as a &quot;Konservat-Lagerstätte&quot; may be based on a number of different factors which constitute &quot;exceptional preservation&quot;. These may include the completeness of specimens, soft tissue preservation, fine-scale detail, taxonomic richness, distinctive taphonomic pathways (often multiple at the same site), the extent of the fossil layer in time and space, and particular sediment facies encouraging preservation.

<doc id="346569" wikidata="Q308920" url="?curid=346569" title="The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie">
<text>The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie () is a 1972 French-language surrealist black comedy film directed by Luis Buñuel, who wrote the screenplay in collaboration with Jean-Claude Carrière. The narrative concerns a group of French bourgeoisie and the fictional South American country of Miranda&#x27;s ambassador to France attempting—despite continual interruptions—to dine together. The film stars Fernando Rey, Paul Frankeur, Delphine Seyrig, Bulle Ogier, Stéphane Audran, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Julien Bertheau and Milena Vukotic.

The film consists of several thematically linked scenes: five gatherings of a group of bourgeois friends, and the four dreams of different characters. The beginning of the film focuses on the gatherings, while the latter part focuses on the dreams, but both are intertwined. There are also scenes involving other characters, including two in which a Maoist terrorist from Miranda attempts to assassinate the ambassador. The film&#x27;s world is not logical, and the bizarre events are accepted by the characters.

&quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot; was a critical and commercial success. It won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and BAFTA Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Audran) and Best Original Screenplay (Buñuel and Carrière).

==Plot==

A French bourgeois couple, François and Simone Thévenot, accompany François&#x27;s colleague Don Rafael Acosta (the ambassador from the South American nation of Miranda) and Simone&#x27;s sister Florence to the house of the Sénéchals, the hosts of a dinner party. Alice Sénéchal is surprised to see them, explaining that she expected them the following evening and has no dinner prepared. The would-be guests then invite Alice to join them for dinner at a nearby inn. There, a waitress informs them that the restaurant is under new management. There are no diners inside, and the party hurriedly departs shortly after discovering a vigil for the manager, who died a few hours earlier, in an adjoining room.

Acosta, François, and Alice&#x27;s husband Henri meet the next day at the Mirandan embassy to discuss the proceeds of a large cocaine deal. Acosta sees a young woman selling clockwork-animal toys outside; he shoots one of the toys with a rifle and the woman runs off. He explains that she is part of a Maoist Mirandan terrorist group that has been targeting him for months.

Two days later, the friends arrive at the Sénéchals&#x27; for lunch, but Henri and Alice escape to the garden to have sex instead of joining them. Acosta deduces that the Sénéchals know the police are coming and have fled to avoid arrest for their involvement in drug trafficking, prompting the group to leave in a panic.

When the Sénéchals return from the garden to find the rest of the group gone, they meet a bishop who has donned their gardener&#x27;s clothing. They throw him out, but when he returns wearing his bishop&#x27;s robes, they embrace him with deference. The bishop asks to work for them as their gardener. He tells them that when he was a child, his parents were poisoned with arsenic and the culprit was never apprehended.

The women visit a teahouse, where a soldier tells them about his childhood. Following his mother&#x27;s death, his cold-hearted father sent him to military school. The ghost of the soldier&#x27;s mother informed him that the man was not his real father but his father&#x27;s killer; they had dueled over her. She asks her son to poison the culprit, and he complies.

Simone meets Acosta, with whom she is having an affair, at his apartment. They retreat to his bedroom to have sex but are interrupted by a visit from François, whereupon she makes a convenient excuse and leaves with him. Acosta is then visited by the terrorist, who has come to kill him. He ambushes and chastises her, and tells her to leave after she refuses his sexual advances. As she leaves, he signals to agents waiting across the street, who capture her.

The group convenes at the Sénéchals&#x27; for dinner, but are interrupted the arrival of an army regiment, who join the dinner only to be called away for alarmingly close maneuvers. The colonel invites them to his house in return; Henri dreams that the colonel&#x27;s dining room is a stage set in a theatrical performance where the audience is angry with the actors for not knowing their lines. François dreams that, at the dinner, the colonel badgers Acosta about the political situation in Miranda, culminating in Acosta shooting the colonel.

The bishop is called away from gardening to give absolution to a dying gardener, who confesses to poisoning his former employers due to their mistreatment of him. Realizing that the employers were his parents, the bishop finishes giving the gardener absolution before fatally shooting him with a shotgun.

The Sénéchals, the Thévenots, and Acosta are arrested for drug trafficking. The police chief dreams that the ghost of a former inspector killed in retribution for torturing a student protestor releases the traffickers. He wakes up from the dream to learn that the Interior Minister has ordered them to be released. Acosta dreams that they return to the Sénéchals&#x27; for dinner but are shot by a rival gang of drug traffickers from Marseille. After waking up, he walks to the kitchen and sloppily eats leftovers stored in the refrigerator.

A recurring scene of the six people walking silently and purposefully on an isolated country road is also the final sequence.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Pre-production===
After having announced that &quot;Tristana&quot; (1970) would be his last film because he felt he was repeating himself, Buñuel met with screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière and discussed the topic of repetition. Shortly afterwards, Buñuel met with film producer Serge Silberman, who told him an anecdote about having forgotten about a dinner party and being surprised to see six hungry friends show up at his front door. Buñuel was suddenly inspired, and Silberman agreed to give him a $2,000 advance to write a new script with Carrière. They wrote the first draft in three weeks and finished the fifth draft by the summer of 1971, titled &quot;Bourgeois Enchantment&quot;. Silberman had secured enough money for the film in April 1972, whereupon Buñuel began pre-production.

Buñuel cast many actors whom he had worked with in the past, such as Fernando Rey and Michel Piccoli, and adjusted their roles to their personalities. He had more difficulty casting the female leads, and allowed Delphine Seyrig and Stéphane Audran to choose which parts they would like to play before changing the script to better suit them. When Jean-Pierre Cassel auditioned for his role, he was surprised when Buñuel cast him after simply glancing at him once.

===Filming and editing===
Filming began on 15 May 1972, and lasted for two months on an $800,000 budget (). In his usual shooting style, Buñuel shot few takes and often edited the film in camera and during production; Buñuel and Silberman had a long-running and humorous argument as to whether Buñuel took one day or one and a half days to edit his films.

On the advice of Silberman, Buñuel used video playback monitors on the set for the first time in his career. This resulted in a vastly different style than any of his previous films, including extensive use of zooms and tracking shots instead of his usual close-ups and static camera framing. It also resulted in Buñuel&#x27;s being more comfortable on set and limiting his already minimal direction to technical and physical instructions. This frustrated Cassel, who had never worked with Buñuel before, until Rey explained that this was Buñuel&#x27;s usual style and that since they were playing aristocrats their movements and physical appearance were more important than their inner motivation.

Buñuel once joked that whenever he needed an extra scene he simply filmed one of his own dreams. &quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot; includes three of Buñuel&#x27;s recurring dreams: a dream of being on stage and forgetting his lines, a dream of meeting his dead cousin in the street and following him into a house full of cobwebs, and a dream of waking up to see his dead parents staring at him.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot; was a critical and commercial success in both Europe and the United States. Roger Ebert called it a comedy, but noted that Buñuel&#x27;s comedies were &quot;more like a dig in the ribs, sly and painful.&quot; Robert Benayoun described it as &quot;perhaps [Buñuel&#x27;s] most direct and most &#x27;public&#x27; film&quot;. Vincent Canby wrote: “In addition to being extraordinarily funny and perfectly acted, &quot;The Discreet Charm&quot; moves with the breathtaking speed and self-assurance that only a man of Buñuel’s experience can achieve without resorting to awkward ellipsis.” Buñuel later said that he was disappointed with most critics&#x27; analysis of the film; he also disliked the film&#x27;s promotional poster, depicting a pair of lips with legs and a bowler hat.

Buñuel and Silberman travelled to the United States in late 1972 to promote the film. Buñuel did not attend his own press screening in Los Angeles and told a &quot;Newsweek&quot; reporter that his favorite characters in the film were the cockroaches which appear in one of the dream sequences. While visiting Los Angeles, Buñuel, Carrière and Silberman were invited to a lunch party by Buñuel&#x27;s old friend George Cukor where other guests included Alfred Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, George Stevens, Rouben Mamoulian, John Ford, William Wyler, Robert Mulligan and Robert Wise. Fritz Lang, one of Buñuel&#x27;s favorite directors, was unable to attend, but Buñuel visited him the following day and received an autographed photo.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 98% based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;An intoxicating dose of the director&#x27;s signature surrealist style, &quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot; represents Buñuel at his most accessible.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 93 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Accolades===
===Academy Award win===
Silberman decided not to wait until May 1973 to premiere the film at the Cannes Film Festival, and instead released it in the autumn of 1972 to make it eligible for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Buñuel was famously indifferent to awards and jokingly told a reporter that he had already paid a bribe of $25,000 in order to win the Oscar. Silberman accepted the award on Buñuel&#x27;s behalf at the ceremony. At the Academy&#x27;s request, Buñuel posed with the Oscar statuette for a photograph, but wore a wig and oversized sunglasses.

==Home media==
In January 2021, &quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot; was released by The Criterion Collection as part of a Buñuel box set with its successors &quot;That Obscure Object of Desire&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of Liberty&quot;.

In June 2022, the film received a 4K digital restoration from StudioCanal for its 50th anniversary. The restoration was issued on Blu-ray and DVD.

On 23 March 2018, Panorama released the film on Blu-ray in Hong Kong.

==Adaptations==
In October 2014, Stephen Sondheim and David Ives announced that they were developing a new musical provisionally titled &quot;Square One&quot;, with a plot inspired by both &quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot; and Buñuel&#x27;s 1962 film &quot;The Exterminating Angel&quot;, projected to open in 2017. Production ceased at some point, but Sondheim held a September 2021 reading. Following Sondheim&#x27;s death that November, Ives announced that the musical, retitled &quot;Here We Are&quot;, would have a limited engagement world premiere in September 2023 at The Shed in Manhattan.

<text>The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was a United States federal government complex located at 200 N.W. 5th Street in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. On April 19, 1995, the building was the target of the Oklahoma City bombing by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, which ultimately killed 168 people and injured 684 others. A third of the building collapsed seconds after the truck bomb detonated. The remains were demolished a month after the attack, and the Oklahoma City National Memorial was built on the site.

==Construction and use==
The building was designed by architects Stephen H. Horton and Wendell Locke of Locke, Wright and Associates and constructed by J.W. Bateson Company, Dallas, Texas, using reinforced concrete in 1977 at a cost of $14.5 million. The building, named for federal judge Alfred P. Murrah, an Oklahoma native, opened on March 2, 1977.

By the 1990s, the building contained regional offices for the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the United States Secret Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs vocational rehabilitation counseling center, the Drug Enforcement Administration (D.E.A.), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). It also contained recruiting offices for the U.S. military. It housed approximately 550 employees.
It also housed America&#x27;s Kids, a children&#x27;s day care center.

==Prior bombing plots==
In October 1983, members of the Christian militia group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA), including founder James Ellison and Richard Snell plotted to park &quot;a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer.&quot; While the CSA was building a rocket launcher to attack the building, the ordnance accidentally detonated in a member&#x27;s hands. The CSA took this as divine intervention and called off the planned attack. Convicted of murder in Arkansas in an unrelated case, Snell was executed on April 19, 1995, the same day the bombing of the federal building was carried out, after U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas declined to hear further appeal.

==Destruction==

At 9:02 a.m. local time on April 19, 1995, a Ryder rental truck, containing approximately 7,000 pounds (3,175 kg) of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, nitromethane, and diesel fuel was detonated in front of the building, destroying a third of it and causing severe damage to several other buildings located nearby. As a result, 168 people were killed, including 19 children, and over 800 others were injured. It remains the deadliest domestic terrorist attack, with the most property damage, in the U.S.

Timothy McVeigh, a U.S. Army veteran, was found guilty of the attack in a jury trial and sentenced to death. He was executed in 2001. A co-conspirator, Terry Nichols, is serving multiple life sentences in a federal prison. Third and fourth subjects Michael Fortier and his wife, Lori, assisted in the plot. They testified against both McVeigh and Nichols in exchange for a 12-year prison term for Michael and immunity for Lori. Michael was released into the witness protection program in January 2006.

McVeigh said that he bombed the building on the second anniversary of the Waco siege in 1993 to retaliate for U.S. government actions there and at the siege at Ruby Ridge. However, it is also rumored that the bombing was connected to Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA) white supremacist Richard Snell, who was executed in Arkansas the day of the bombing and who also &quot;predicted&quot; that a bombing would happen on the day of his execution. Fort Smith-based federal prosecutor Steven Snyder told the FBI in May 1995 that Snell previously expressed a desire to target the Murrah building in 1983 as revenge for the IRS raiding his home. Before his execution, McVeigh said that he did not know a day care center was in the building and that, had he known, &quot;It might have given me pause to switch targets.&quot; The FBI said that he scouted the interior of the building in December 1994 and likely knew of the day care center before the bombing.

==Artwork in the building==
Many works of art were in the building when it was destroyed in the Oklahoma City bombing. The Oklahoma City National Memorial displays art that survived the bombing. Nineteen pieces of art recovered from the Murrah Building are on permanent display on the first floor of the University of Central Oklahoma&#x27;s Max Chambers Library. These pieces include:

* &quot;Monolith IV,&quot; sculpture by Franklin Simons
* &quot;Morning Mist,&quot; photograph by David Halpern
* &quot;Charon&#x27;s Sentinels,&quot; photograph by David Halpern
* &quot;North of Cunningham,&quot; photograph by Albert Durr Edgar
* &quot;Cowboy in Coffee Shop,&quot; photograph by Curt Clyne
* &quot;Morning in Taos,&quot; fiber art by Betty Jo Kidson
* &quot;Sun Form,&quot; fiber sculpture by Dena Madole
* &quot;Storm,&quot; sculpture by Richard Davis
* &quot;Double Layers,&quot; fiber art by Jane Knight

Lost works are as follows:
* &quot;Sky Ribbons: An Oklahoma Tribute&quot;, 1978 fiber sculpture by Gerhardt Knodel
* &quot;Columbines at Cascade Canyon&quot;, photograph by Albert D. Edgar
* &quot;Winter Scene&quot;, photograph by Curt Clyne
* &quot;Soaring Currents&quot;, sisal and rayon textile by Karen Chapnick
* &quot;Monolith&quot;, porcelain sculpture by Frank Simons
* &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, wool textile by Anna Burgress
* &quot;Palm Tree Coil&quot;, bronze sculpture by Jerry McMillan.

An untitled acrylic sculpture by Fred Eversley was severely damaged, but survived the blast.

==Demolition==
Rescue and recovery efforts were concluded at 11:50 pm on May 1, with the bodies of all but three victims recovered. For safety reasons, the remains were to be demolished shortly afterward. However, McVeigh&#x27;s attorney, Stephen Jones, called for a motion to delay the demolition until the defense team could examine the site in preparation for the trial. More than a month after the bombing, at 7:01 am on May 23, the remains were demolished. The final three bodies, those of two credit union employees and a customer, were recovered. For several days after the remains&#x27; demolition, trucks hauled 800 tons of debris a day away from the site. Some of it was used as evidence in the conspirators&#x27; trials, incorporated into parts of memorials, donated to local schools, or sold to raise funds for relief efforts.

==Remnants and replacement==
Several remnants of the building stand on the site of the Oklahoma City National Memorial. The plaza (on what was once its south side) has been incorporated into the memorial; the original flagpole is still in use. The east wall (within the building&#x27;s footprint) is intact, as well as portions of the south wall. The underground parking garage survived the blast and is used today, but is guarded and closed to the public.

Consideration was given to not replacing the Murrah Building and to renting office space for agencies affected. Ultimately, the General Services Administration broke ground on a replacement building in 2001 which was completed in 2003. The new 185,000-square-foot building was designed by Ross Barney Architects of Chicago, Illinois, with Carol Ross Barney as the lead designer. Constructed on a two-city-block site, one block north and west of the former site, the new building&#x27;s design maximized sustainable design and workplace productivity initiatives. Security design was paramount to the Federal employees and its neighbors. Secure design was achieved based on the GSA&#x27;s current standards for secure facilities including blast resistant glazing. Structural design resists progressive collapse. Building mass, glazing inside the courtyard, and bollards help to maintain a sense of openness and security. The art in architecture component of the building incorporates a water feature that acts as an additional security barrier.

<text>A brazier () is a container used to burn charcoal or other solid fuel for cooking, heating or rituals. It often takes the form of a metal box or bowl with feet, but in some places it is made of terracotta. Its elevation helps circulate air, feeding oxygen to the fire. Braziers have been used since ancient times; the Nimrud brazier dates to at least 824 BC.

==History==

The word brazier is mentioned in the Bible. The Hebrew word for brazier is believed to be of Egyptian origin, suggesting that it was imported from Egypt. The lone reference to it in the Bible being the following verse:

The king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month; and the brazier () was burning before him.

Roman Emperor Jovian was poisoned by the fumes from a brazier in his tent in 364, ending the line of Constantine.

In Arabic, the brazier is called &quot;kanoun&quot;.

==Uses==

===Heating===
Despite risks in burning charcoal on open fires, braziers were widely adopted for domestic heating, particularly and somewhat more safely used (namely in unglazed, shuttered-only buildings) in the Spanish-speaking world. Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl noted that Tezozomoc, the Tlatoani of the Tepanec city of Azcapotzalco, slept between two braziers because he was so old that he produced no natural heat. Nineteenth-century British travellers such as diplomat and scientist Woodbine Parish and the writer Richard Ford, author of &quot;A Handbook for Travellers in Spain&quot;, state that widely braziers were considered healthier than fireplaces and chimneys.

The brazier could sit in the open in a large room; often it was incorporated into furniture. Many cultures developed their own variants of a low table, with a heat source underneath and blankets to capture the warmth: the &quot;kotatsu&quot; in Japan, the &quot;korsi&quot; in Iran, the &quot;sandali&quot; in Afghanistan, and the foot stove in northern Europe. In Spain the &quot;brasero&quot; continued to be one of the main means of heating until the early 20th century; Gerald Brenan described in his memoir &quot;South from Granada&quot; its widespread habit in the 1920s of placing dying embers of a brazier beneath a cloth-covered table to keep the legs and feet of the family warm on winter evenings.

===Scent===
Moist rose and grapevine trimmings produce a pungent, sweet-smelling smoke, and make charcoal, but unless fully pre-dried (seasoned or kilned) as with wood, do produce carcinogenic particulates in the air.

Aromatics (lavender seeds, orange peel) were sometimes added to the embers in the brazier.

A &quot;brazier&quot; for burning aromatics (incense) is known as a censer or thurible.

===Other===
In some churches a brazier is used to host a small fire, called new fire, which is then used to light the Paschal candle during the Easter Vigil.

Braziers were common on industrial picket lines, largely replaced by protest marches and rallies, and a newspaper casts strikes as more white collar as a further reason for their decline.

The Japanese translation is &quot;hibachi&quot; - principally for cooking and in cultural rituals such as the Japanese tea ceremony.

Since 1957 Dairy Queen has used the word &quot;brazier&quot; on their signage to indicate the particular locations that serve hot food like hot dogs and hamburgers, etc..

<text>The Southern Baptists of Texas Convention (SBTC) is an association of conservative Baptist churches in Texas, supportive of the Southern Baptist Convention and its entities. The Southern Baptists of Texas were formed by churches within the Baptist General Convention of Texas so that they might partner more closely with the national body in a fellowship based on a common, conservative commitment to the inerrancy of Scripture. As of 2011, it had approximately 2,300 affiliated churches.

== History ==

The earliest precursor to the SBTC was the &quot;Conservative Baptist Fellowship of Texas.&quot; Members of that fellowship joined other conservative Southern Baptists to form the &quot;Southern Baptists of Texas&quot; in 1995. This group operated within the Baptist General Convention of Texas until a new entity the &quot;Southern Baptists of Texas Convention&quot; was founded in 1998.

The groups that preceded the new convention sought closer cooperation between the Baptist General convention of Texas and the Southern Baptist Convention than existed during the conservative resurgence of the national body. However, the Baptist General Convention of Texas&#x27;s refusal to endorse the more conservative leanings of SBC leadership led the &quot;Southern Baptists of Texas&quot; to organize a separate state convention in November 1998. The new state convention, though autonomous, immediately formed closer partnerships with the entities of the SBC, similar to most other state conventions.

As it continued to grow, the SBTC adopted the Southern Baptist Convention&#x27;s 2000 Baptist Faith and Message as its own statement of faith. The SBTC&#x27;s purpose, according to its mission statement, is to &quot;facilitate, extend, and enlarge the Great Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention and Southern Baptist churches and associations of Texas.&quot; Churches have only been allowed to affiliate if they affirm the convention&#x27;s statement of faith; consents to work within its legal frameworks and cooperates; and affirms a male-only pastorate and rejects affirming the LGBTQ community.

Several new Baptist associations have been formed by SBTC churches (one being the North Texas Baptist Association, serving the Dallas-Fort Worth area), though the SBTC itself does not promote their formation. Most SBTC churches choose to remain in longtime associations.

==Partnerships and affiliations==
The SBTC does not own and operate any institutions of higher education or any other form of ministry. However, it has affiliations and partnerships with entities that are owned by the Southern Baptist Convention or directly related to themselves. For instance, the Southern Baptists of Texas has an affiliative relationship with Criswell College in Dallas, and Jacksonville College; Jacksonville is however operated by the Baptist Missionary Association of America.

<text>Dialects are linguistic varieties that may differ in pronunciation, vocabulary, spelling, and other aspects of grammar. For the classification of varieties of English only in of pronunciation, see regional accents of English.

== Overview ==
Dialects can be defined as &quot;sub-forms of languages which are, in general, mutually comprehensible.&quot; English speakers from different countries and regions use a variety of different accents (systems of pronunciation) as well as various localized words and grammatical constructions. Many different dialects can be identified based on these factors. Dialects can be classified at broader or narrower levels: within a broad national or regional dialect, various more localised sub-dialects can be identified, and so on. The combination of differences in pronunciation and use of local words may make some English dialects almost unintelligible to speakers from other regions without any prior exposure.

The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into three general categories: the British Isles dialects, those of North America, and those of Australasia. Dialects can be associated not only with place but also with particular social groups. Within a given English-speaking country, there is a form of the language considered to be Standard English: the Standard Englishes of different countries differ and can themselves be considered dialects. Standard English is often associated with the more educated layers of society as well as more formal registers.

British and American English are the reference norms for English as spoken, written, and taught in the rest of the world, excluding countries in which English is spoken natively such as Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. In many former British Empire countries in which English is not spoken natively, British English forms are closely followed, alongside numerous American English usages that have become widespread throughout the English-speaking world. Conversely, a number of countries with historical ties to the United States tend to follow American English conventions. Many of these countries, while retaining strong British English or American English influences, have developed their own unique dialects, which include Indian English and Philippine English.

Chief among other native English dialects are Canadian English and Australian English, which rank third and fourth in the number of native speakers. For the most part, Canadian English, while featuring numerous British forms, alongside indigenous Canadianisms, shares vocabulary, phonology and syntax with American English, which leads many to recognise North American English as an organic grouping of dialects. Australian English, likewise, shares many American and British English usages, alongside plentiful features unique to Australia and retains a significantly higher degree of distinctiveness from both larger varieties than does Canadian English. South African English, New Zealand English and Irish English are also distinctive and rank fifth, sixth, and seventh in the number of native speakers.

<doc id="346594" wikidata="Q1360987" url="?curid=346594" title="Mary Had a Little Lamb">
<text>&quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; is an English-language nursery rhyme of nineteenth-century American origin, first published by American writer Sarah Josepha Hale in 1830. Its Roud Folk Song Index number is 7622.

==Background==
The nursery rhyme was first published by the Boston publishing firm Marsh, Capen &amp; Lyon, as a poem by Sarah Josepha Hale on May 24, 1830, and was possibly inspired by an actual incident. As described in one of Hale&#x27;s biographies:

&quot;Sarah began teaching young boys and &quot;girls&quot; in a small school not far from her home [in Newport, New Hampshire] ... It was at this small school that the incident involving &#x27;Mary&#x27;s Lamb&#x27; is reputed to have taken place. Sarah was surprised one morning to see one of her students, a girl named Mary, enter the classroom followed by her pet lamb. The visitor was far too distracting to be permitted to remain in the building and so Sarah &#x27;turned him out.&#x27; The lamb stayed nearby till school was dismissed and then ran up to Mary looking for attention and protection. The other youngsters wanted to know why the lamb loved Mary so much and their teacher explained it was because Mary loved her pet. Then Sarah used the incident to get a moral across to the class: 

Why does the lamb love Mary so?
Mary so, Mary so?

Why does the lamb love Mary so?
The eager children smiled,

Mary loves the lamb, you know,
Lamb, you know, lamb, you know,

Mary loves the lamb, you know The teacher’s happy smile. 

== Authorship controversy ==

In 1876, at the age of 70, Mary Tyler emerged to claim that she was the &quot;Mary&quot; from the poem. As a young girl, Mary kept a pet lamb that she took to school one day at the suggestion of her brother. A commotion naturally ensued. Mary recalled, &quot;Visiting school that morning was a young man by the name of John Roulstone; a nephew of the Reverend Lemuel Capen, who was then settled in Sterling, Massachusetts. It was the custom then for students to prepare for college with ministers, and, for this purpose, Roulstone was studying with his uncle. The young man was very much pleased with the incident of the lamb, and, the next day, he rode across the fields on horseback, to the little old schoolhouse and handed me a slip of paper, which had written upon it the three original stanzas of the poem.&quot; This account is not supported by evidence beyond Mary&#x27;s memory. The &quot;slip of paper&quot; has never been produced as evidence. The earliest evidence of the poem&#x27;s publication is Sarah Josepha Hale&#x27;s 1830 collection of poems, supporting her complete authorship of the poem.

Even though this claim is unsupported by evidence, multiple sites in Sterling, Massachusetts, perpetuate the claim. A tall statue and historical marker representing Mary&#x27;s Little Lamb stands in the town center. The Redstone School, where Mary Sawyer attended school and purports the incident took place, was built in 1798. The property was later purchased by Henry Ford and relocated to a churchyard, on the property of Longfellow&#x27;s Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Massachusetts. Mary Sawyer&#x27;s house, located in Sterling, Massachusetts, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000, but was destroyed by arson on August 12, 2007.

==Text==
The text as originally published consisted of three stanzas, each of eight lines, although the ABAB rhyme scheme (ABCB in the first four lines) allows each stanza to be divided into two four-line parts.

In the 1830s, Lowell Mason set the nursery rhyme to a melody. However, Mason&#x27;s version is not the one commonly sung today. Today, it is commonly sung to the same tune as &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; (the chorus of &quot;Goodnight, Ladies&quot;) with repetition in the verses:

== Recordings ==

The rhyme was the first audio recorded by Thomas Edison on his newly invented phonograph in 1877. It was the first instance of recorded English verse, following the recording of the French folk song &quot;Au clair de la lune&quot; by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville in 1860. In 1927, Edison reenacted the recording, which still survives. The earliest recording (1878) was retrieved by 3D imaging equipment in 2012.

==Media==
Note: This melody is the British version, which is slightly different from the American version. The melody of the fourth bar in the British version consists of one note repeated three times, whereas in the American version, the fourth bar consists of one note, then a note repeated twice that is two steps higher than the previous note.

<doc id="346599" wikidata="Q216642" url="?curid=346599" title="Spade">
<text>A spade is a tool primarily for digging consisting of a long handle and blade, typically with the blade narrower and flatter than the common shovel. Early spades were made of riven wood or of animal bones (often shoulder blades). After the art of metalworking was developed, spades were made with sharper tips of metal. Before the introduction of metal spades manual labor was less efficient at moving earth, with picks being required to break up the soil in addition to a spade for moving the dirt. With a metal tip, a spade can both break and move the earth in most situations, increasing efficiency. A classic spade, with a narrow body and flat (or near flat) tip is suited for digging post holes, and is not to be confused with a &quot;roundpoint&quot; shovel, which has a wider body and tapered tip.

==Etymology==
English &quot;spade&quot; is from Old English &#x27; (f.) or &#x27; (m.). The same word is found in Old Frisian &#x27; and Old Saxon &#x27;. High German &quot;&quot; only appears in Early Modern German, probably loaned from Low German. In the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Norway the word is &quot;spade&quot; as well. Other Scandinavian forms are in turn loaned from German.
The term may thus not originate in Common Germanic and appears to be a North Sea Germanic innovation or loaned. Closely related is Greek : , whence Latin &quot;&quot;.

==Designs==
Spades are made in many shapes and sizes, for a variety of different functions and jobs, and there are many different designs used in spade manufacturing. People often mistakenly use the word &quot;shovel&quot; interchangeably with spade but shovel is a generic term for a variety of tools that include numerous broad-bottomed versions for moving loose materials, such as a &quot;coal shovel&quot;, &quot;snow shovel&quot;, &quot;grain shovel&quot;, etc., whereas spades tend to have a sharpened edge, curved profile, and pointed end better designed for digging. Noting that the term &quot;garden spade&quot; is attached to certain sharp-edged but square ended tools suited to cutting through sod.

The most common garden spade typically has a long handle, is wide, and is treaded (has rests for the feet to drive the spade into the ground). An &quot;Irish spade&quot; is similar to a common garden spade, with the same general design, although it has a much thinner head. A &quot;border spade&quot; has a similarly shaped blade, but much smaller, as a garden spade; the handle is proportionately longer, though. 
A &quot;sharpshooter&quot; is a long, narrow spade - sometimes with thick flanged treads extending beyond the width of the blade to allow for a boot to fit on - for getting into tight spots or for cutting post holes. 

A &quot;turfing iron&quot; has a short, round head, and is used for cutting and paring off turf. 

A &quot;digging fork,&quot; or &quot;grape,&quot; not referred to as a spade, is forked much like a pitchfork, and is useful for loosening ground and gardening. 

The &quot;fishtail spade&quot; has a flared triangular blade combining the versatility of the dutch hoe and power of the common round point shovel into a multipurpose tool.

Small spades are made as toys for children. 

==Loy ploughing==

Loy ploughing was a form of manual ploughing carried out in Ireland using a form of spade called a loy. It was done on very small farms where horses could not be afforded or did not have enough work, and on very hilly ground where horses could not work. It was used on poorer land until the 1960s. This suited the moist climate of Ireland as the trenches formed by turning in the sods providing drainage. It also allowed potatoes to be grown on mountain slopes where nothing else could be cultivated.

==Currency==
The blade of the spade was used as currency in ancient China. Later, they were miniaturized and then stylized into a flat piece. The Qin dynasty replaced them with round coins.

==Also called spades==
* In the oil and chemical process industries, a spade is a round piece of metal with a small tab that is placed in between two pipe flanges to give positive isolation from the centre, usually to prevent cross-contamination between fluids or to allow work on the line. The name comes from the shape, which is a little like a garden spade. The small tab shows that the spade is in place. 
* In kitchenware, certain ice cream scoops are called spades due to the shape. These scoops are used more in making hand-scooped milkshakes or desserts where a lot of ice cream can be scooped at once and the typical &quot;ball&quot; shape of scooped ice cream (i.e., scoops on a cone) is not needed. The spade-shaped head also helps scrape off the ice cream stuck to the sides of the cartons.

<doc id="346605" wikidata="Q699959" url="?curid=346605" title="Arriva Trains Wales">
<text>Arriva Trains Wales (ATW; ) was a British train operating company owned by Arriva UK Trains that operated the Wales &amp; Borders franchise. It ran urban and inter-urban passenger services to all railway stations in Wales, including , , , , and , as well as to certain stations in England such as , , , Crewe, and .

In August 2003, Arriva UK Trains was awarded the newly created Wales &amp; Borders franchise by the Strategic Rail Authority, Arrival Trains Wales began operation during December 2003, taking over from Wales and Borders. Following the implementation of the Railways Act 2005 and Transport (Wales) Act 2006, responsibility for the franchise was devolved to the Welsh Government, which worked closely with Arriva Trains Wales during its period of operations. Numerous service changes were made under the company&#x27;s management; on 6 February 2008, the Ebbw Valley Railway was partially re-opened to passenger services for the first time in over 40 years. Another high-profile change during December of that year was the inauguration of the locomotive-hauled Holyhead to Cardiff Premier Service.

In March 2010, Arriva Trains Wales&#x27; application to reinstate a direct Aberystwyth to London Marylebone service was rejected by the Office of Rail Regulation due to concerns over its financial viability, as well as the potential severe revenue abstraction from other operators such as Wrexham &amp; Shropshire. In July 2012, the Department for Transport announced that the Cardiff Valley Lines would be electrified, although this ambition would not be substantiated during Arriva Train Wales&#x27; franchise period. During the mid-2010s, as the franchise period was nearing its end, tenders were sought for its next operator; Arriva Trains Wales&#x27; publicly withdrew from the process in October 2017 despite having been shortlisted. On 23 May 2018, KeolisAmey Wales was selected as the winning bid. On 13 October 2018, Arriva Trains Wales&#x27; franchise came to an end, operations being transferred to successor operator KeolisAmey that same day.

==History==
During March 2000, the UK government announced its plans to create a separate Wales &amp; Borders franchise. In October 2001, the two National Express-operated franchises, Valley Lines and Wales &amp; West, were reorganised, after which the new Wales &amp; Borders franchise assumed responsibility for the majority of services in Wales as shown on its map. The services from Birmingham New Street to Chester, Aberystwyth, and Pwllheli operated by Central Trains were also transferred. In October 2002, a shortlist of Arriva, Connex/GB Railways, National Express and Serco-Abellio were invited to bid for the new franchise period.

On 1 August 2003, the Strategic Rail Authority awarded the new franchise to Arriva UK Trains. The new franchise was for fifteen years, with performance reviews every five years; Arriva Trains Wales took over the services operated by Wales &amp; Borders on 7 December 2003. The next five-yearly review period concluded on 31 March 2013. On 28 September 2003, the services from Birmingham New Street, Crewe and Manchester Piccadilly to Llandudno and Holyhead, as well as those between Bidston and Wrexham Central and between Llandudno and Blaenau Ffestiniog, operated by First North Western, were transferred to the new Wales &amp; Borders franchise.

As a result of the Railways Act 2005 and the Transport (Wales) Act 2006, responsibility for the franchise was later devolved to the Welsh Government. Subsequently, the Welsh Government closely coordinated with Arriva Trains Wales in the management and development of the railway network within Wales. Changes included the introduction of direct services between North and South Wales, and the reintroduction of passenger services on previously freight-only portions of the Vale of Glamorgan Line and Ebbw Vale Line.

At its height, ATW operated over a route length of 1691 km, with 253 diesel multiple unit (DMU) cars and 22 locomotive-hauled passenger carriages. Its busiest Welsh stations were , and in South Wales, and and in North Wales.

ATW operated almost all services in Wales, with the exception of:
* /// to London Paddington (Great Western Railway)
* Cardiff Central to or (Great Western Railway)
* Cardiff Central to or (CrossCountry)
* /Bangor/Wrexham General to London Euston (Virgin Trains West Coast)
* various heritage railways

==Performance==

In October 2006, ATW was ranked seventh best (out of 21 companies) with an above average 89.9% of trains &#x27;on time&#x27; according to Network Rail statistics. The latest figures released by NR (Network Rail) rate punctuality (Public Performance Measure) at 96.1% for period 7 of the 2013/14 financial year. The MAA (Monthly Annual Average) figure for the 366 days up to 12 October 2013 is currently at 93.9%.

In September 2017, a review on the conditions during a regular peak commute was published by &#x27;Stu&#x27;s Reviews&#x27;. This review was publicised through several of the national news networks, including Wales Online, and BBC Wales.

==Welsh-language services==

The Welsh Language Act 1993 requires all public bodies to provide services to the public through the medium of Welsh as well as English. As a private company and not a public body, Arriva Trains Wales was not legally required to provide service in Welsh, but it did conduct some business in Welsh. All stations previously run by Arriva Trains Wales where the Welsh and English names differed had both names displayed, with a few minor omissions. Arriva did not display Welsh names in the English stations which it managed, such as Chester (), Shrewsbury (), or Hereford (), but included the Welsh names in its now discontinued printed timetables and other publicity material. There were bilingual signs at Hereford, for example, warning against trespassing on the railway.

Arriva Trains Wales introduced bilingual display screens and announcements in at least 46 stations.

In 2004, ATW introduced a Welsh-language telephone line. Its website was named the &quot;Best Website of The Year in the Technology Wales Awards 2004&quot;.

==Routes==

===North Wales===
Services along the North Wales Coast Line terminated at and . Llandudno services ran every hour to Manchester Piccadilly via and . Holyhead services ran every hour, to via Chester and , then alternately to or . Request stations west of Llandudno Junction (Conwy, , , , , , and ) were generally served by alternate trains. The Conwy Valley Line were operated by a single train running between Llandudno and , with six return journeys a day. The private Ffestiniog Railway operated connecting services between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Minffordd near Porthmadog.

Services on the Borderlands Line ran from to on the Wirral Peninsula, crossing the North Wales Coast Line at . This line connected with main-line services at Wrexham General; with North Wales Coast line services at Shotton; and with electrified lines operated by Merseyrail at Bidston. It may be converted to electric operation in the future.

===Mid Wales===
Cambrian Line services consisted of trains from to , Birmingham New Street and every two hours. Services from joined this train at . Services were operated exclusively by Class 158 &quot;Express Sprinters&quot;, as they were the only units fitted with the necessary equipment for the ERTMS system used on the line.

The single-track nature of this line, coupled with the busy terminus at Birmingham New Street, meant that delays had in some cases resulted in partial cancellation of services on this line. Beginning December 2008, most services had been extended to the less busy Birmingham International station, giving more flexibility in making up any lost time; this was also intended to help international students at Aberystwyth University gain easier access to an airport. The Heart of Wales Line had services from to Shrewsbury via and four or five times a day. It was marketed by Arriva Trains Wales as a scenic, rural line, with special rover tickets available.

===South Wales===
ATW operated an hourly long-distance service from to Manchester Piccadilly via and the Welsh Marches Line. Some off-peak services terminated at or originated from Cardiff Central, and continued to or came from every two hours. There was also one service per day from Fishguard Harbour to Manchester Piccadilly, but not in the other direction. Some services operated to Tenby, Pembroke Dock, Carmarthen and Maesteg from Manchester Piccadilly.

ATW also operated a service every two hours from Cardiff Central to via , other branches of the West Wales Line as served by trains from Swansea and Cardiff Central. Trains operated a shuttle service between Swansea and Cardiff Central (known as Swanline), calling at more minor stations than the Great Western Railway InterCity services did.

ATW also operated the Heart of Wales line between Shrewsbury and Swansea via , with four trains per day in each direction. Special trains extending into South East Wales operated to Builth Road during the Royal Welsh Show annually in July.

===Cardiff and Valleys===


The Valley Lines network, previously operated as a separate franchise, was a collection of urban lines in Cardiff and the surrounding area, including the South Wales Valleys and the Vale of Glamorgan. Arriva Trains Wales also operated a service from to . Stations in the valleys north of Cardiff experienced strong passenger growth, as a result of which there was a new half-hourly service launched (Pontypridd-Treherbert, Abercynon-Aberdare, Abercynon-Merthyr Tydfil and in the future Bargoed to Rhymney). Service frequency growth at the fringes was a significant problem because of often lengthy single-track sections. Between the larger towns and Cardiff, these services combined to provide at least one train every 15 minutes, with six trains previously ran per hour between Pontypridd and Cardiff, and four trains per hour between Bargoed and Cardiff. Stations on the Treherbert and Rhymney branch lines were lengthened to accommodate six-car trains to cope with future growth demand for commuting into and out of the capital.

On 6 February 2008, the Ebbw Valley Railway was partially re-opened to passenger services for the first time in over 40 years. It provided an hourly service from Ebbw Vale Town railway station (opened 17 May 2015) to Cardiff Central calling at Ebbw Vale Parkway, , Newbridge, , , , Pye Corner, and Cardiff Central. One year after opening, the line had carried 573,442 passengers, beating all targets set by the Welsh Assembly Government. Saturday trains ran as four-car formations instead of the standard two. Extra carriages were also added during school holidays when demand was high. Possible developments that never saw the light of day also included restoring the service between Ebbw Vale and Newport; before Arriva discontinued operations, the proposal awaited Network Rail and Welsh Government approval. If it has been implemented, it would have provided an hourly service between Newport and Ebbw Vale. Due to the end of Arrival Train Wales&#x27; operations, any further plans will now be implemented under TFW.

In July 2012, the Department for Transport announced that the Cardiff Valley Lines would be electrified, although no timescale has been given. This will entail replacement of the life-expired &quot;Pacer&quot; railbuses by new or cascaded stock. This project did not emerge within the Arriva Trains Wales era, and shall now occur under the auspices of successor operator TFW..

===Welsh Marches and Border===
Services between and Newport formed part of other ATW services already mentioned, such as to , or to Manchester Piccadilly. Coming north, after calling at (for connections to Mid-Wales), trains for North Wales go to via Wrexham General, and trains for Manchester go to .

===Premier Service===

A weekday Premier Service between Holyhead and Cardiff was introduced on 15 December 2008. This was run under contract to the Welsh Government. Wrexham &amp; Shropshire and Grand Central expressed an interest in operating the service, but the contract was awarded to Arriva Trains Wales. At the time of the launch, it was known as &quot;Y Gerallt Gymro&quot; (Gerald of Wales), it was subsequently named as the &quot;Premier Service&quot;.

The Premium Service departed Holyhead at 05:34, returning from Cardiff departing at 17:16. It featured first-class accommodation and a full dining car with a travelling chef. Normal standard-class fares were valid on the train. First class attracted a supplement and included a complementary breakfast on the morning service and a three-course meal on the evening service. This was the only ATW service to offer first-class accommodation. It originally ran via Crewe but, in September 2012, the service was rerouted via Wrexham General, which required the train to change direction at Chester in addition to having its evening departure moved from 16:15.

In December 2014, the Premier Service was rebranded as the &quot;Business Class Service&quot; in an move by Arriva Trains Wales to promote the service and specifically appeal to those travelling to and from Cardiff to work. Ticket prices remained the same and were still sold as first class, and the restaurant service remains, although tablecloths and antimacassars were removed to promote a more work-like environment.

===Special services===
For special events, such as football or rugby matches, ATW commonly operated additional services to the venue. Wales &amp; Borders had arranged in the past a stopping service to . Numerous other services have been operated. ATW usually operated shuttle services to Newport on match days. When rugby international matches are held at the Millennium Stadium, ATW often ran an extra Holyhead to Cardiff service using the &quot;Premier Service&quot; rolling stock.
In April 2015, ATW were highly criticised and issued an apology for their continual poor performance when dealing with the Judgement Day rugby matches at the Millennium Stadium. Passengers were left queuing for hours due to the lack of services and lack of carriages available, some had to abandon their journeys for other means such as taxi and van hire. A spokesman for the company said “I want to assure all customers that every single train in Wales was out [on Saturday].” He added that the event differed to international rugby events, because the majority of those travelling to the matches travelled from south and south west Wales, placing huge pressure on specific routes.

===Former services===
Arriva Trains Wales used to operate services from Manchester Piccadilly, Pembroke Dock, Carmarthen and Swansea to London Waterloo, Brighton, Portsmouth Harbour, Plymouth and Penzance via Cardiff, Bristol and Westbury. Services south of Cardiff are operated by Great Western Railway, while the Bristol Temple Meads to London Waterloo services are operated by South Western Railway

===Rejected services===
During late 2009, ATW filed an application to reinstate a direct Aberystwyth to London Marylebone service, serving all stations to Birmingham International and additionally calling at Leamington Spa and Bicester North. As proposed, two off-peak trains would have operated each day, while a further service would have been added on Saturdays in high summer. Rolling stock would have been Class 158 &quot;Sprinters&quot;.

There were concerns voiced that, if ATW were granted this service, it would push Wrexham General to London Marylebone operator Wrexham &amp; Shropshire out of business; Wrexham &amp; Shropshire&#x27;s Managing Director, Andy Hamilton, stated: &quot;We believe that this proposal – if approved – would push the date of profitability of WSMR by at least a year. As a result of this our owning group would be unable to sustain additional and continuing losses and the WSMR service would cease to exist.&quot; In March 2010, it was announced that the application has been rejected by the Office of Rail Regulation due to concerns about the financial viability of the service and the potentially high level of revenue abstraction caused to other operators. Wrexham &amp; Shropshire ceased to operate roughly one year later.

==Rolling stock==

Arriva Trains Wales services were exclusively operated by diesel trains. This was largely due to there being no electrified railway lines in Wales at the time of the franchise. Arriva Trains Wales operated a fleet of 125 diesel multiple units. It also leased three locomotive-haul units for express services between Holyhead and Cardiff, and had occasionally used hired-in locomotives to run extra services for sporting events.

ATW inherited a fleet of Class 142, 143, 150, 153, 158 and 175s from Wales &amp; Borders. The Class 175s were a common-user fleet, with 11 required by First TransPennine Express each day.

In the early years of the franchise, ATW operated locomotive-hauled services using Mark 2 carriages on services from Cardiff Central to Rhymney and Fishguard Harbour hauled by English Welsh &amp; Scottish Class 37s and FiftyFund Class 50s, and from Crewe and Manchester Piccadilly to Holyhead hauled by Freightliner Class 47s and Virgin Trains Class 57s. ATW built up a fleet of 20 Mark 2 carriages to operate these; all had been withdrawn by 2007, most of them being stored at Long Marston.

Following the delivery of new stock to First TransPennine Express in 2006, all of the Class 175s became available to ATW, resulting in 16 Class 158s being released for transfer to other operators.

In 2006, heritage unit 121032 was purchased by ATW for use on the Cardiff Bay Shuttle. The unit was overhauled by LNWR, Crewe, entering service with ATW on 17 August 2006. In 2013, the unit suffered an engine failure. This could not be rectified, meaning that the unit was withdrawn. It was then used as a source of spare parts by sister company Chiltern Railways.

In November 2007, another nine Class 150s were transferred from Central Trains. From February 2008, five Class 150s (150278-282) were subleased to First Great Western. This was later reduced to four and then two, the last examples being returned during 2011.

In December 2008, the loco-hauled Holyhead to Cardiff &quot;Premier Service&quot; was inaugurated. It was initially hauled by Class 57s on hire from Virgin Trains, initially in top-and-tail formation and later singularly, hauling three standard class MK2s and a MK3 first/buffet. Four Class 57s were repainted at Cardiff Canton and six Mark 2s were refreshed at Eastleigh Works. During March 2012, newer Class 67 locomotives took over from the Class 57s, and Mark 3 carriages refurbished by Pullman Rail replaced the older Mark 2s in October 2012. From October 2011 until August 2012, 150280 was subleased to National Express East Anglia/Abellio Greater Anglia. In December 2014, a further Mark 3 set was introduced on services from Manchester Piccadilly-Holyhead/Llandudno.

==Depots==
Arriva Trains Wales&#x27; fleet were stabled at three depots.
* Chester (Alstom): 
* Cardiff Canton: , , , and Mark 3 stock.
* Machynlleth: 

==Demise==
During the mid-2010s, as Arriva Trains Wales&#x27; 15-year franchise period came towards its scheduled end date, the process to select a successor was started. In October 2016, Abellio, Arriva, Keolis/Amey and MTR Corporation were shortlisted to bid for the next franchise. During September 2017, the formal Invitation to Tender was issued.

During October 2017, it was announced that Arriva was voluntarily withdrawing itself from the tendering process; the decision was reportedly viewed by some politicians as having raised questions about the franchise process. In February 2018, rival firm Abellio also opted to withdraw, which was largely due to its partner company Carillion having effectively collapsed and entered liquidation one month earlier.

On 23 May 2018, it was announced that KeolisAmey Wales has been selected to operate the next Wales &amp; Borders franchise, which was set to run for 15 years, following the expiry of Arriva Trains Wales&#x27; franchise.

<doc id="346608" wikidata="Q1754489" url="?curid=346608" title="Tangerine Computer Systems">
<text>Tangerine Computer Systems was a British microcomputer company founded in 1979 by Dr. Paul Johnson, Mark Rainer and Nigel Penton Tilbury in St. Ives, Cambridgeshire.

The very first product was the successful TAN1648 VDU kit which received much acclaim in the technical press.

The home computer market was beginning to move, albeit slowly, and it was essential to establish a presence. Development and expansion was imperative. It was decided that the latter two partners would relinquish their involvement in order to focus on their consultancy work.

Barry Muncaster became involved operationally and the company moved to new premises in Ely, Cambridgeshire. The company was later renamed, and was known as Oric Products International.

==Early years: Microtan 65==

Tangerine produced one of the first 6502-based kit computers, the Microtan 65. It had a 3U form factor, a small amount of memory (RAM), a video character generator and UHF modulator for use with a TV set, and a simple latch for entering hex data from a keypad, and the computer was designed to be expandable. The manual came with a one-kilobyte listing of Conway&#x27;s Game of Life. An optional expansion board could be built with a UART, more memory and BASIC ROMs. Additional expansion boards became available later, offering more RAM, dedicated serial and parallel I/O boards, etc.

After the Microtan 65, Tangerine planned to build a desktop machine and managed to get as far as selling the design for the Microtan 2, also known as Tangerine Tiger, to HH Electronics, better known for building amplifiers. They released it as the HH Tiger, but it was not a commercial success.

==Tantel==
Several Prestel machines were sold, under the general designation of &quot;Tantel&quot;:

*AlphaTantel (1981) – Prestel adapter with a full keyboard and a phone connection jack. Connection to a TV was through a RF modulator, but there was also a RGB output. Built in modem was 1200 baud. It was possible to connect a tape recorder to save data and a printer.
*New Tantel Adaptor (1981) – Prestel adapter
*Tantel Data Adaptor (1984) – Data adaptor for use with the Prestel system, including a data tape recorder

==1983 onwards: The Oric family==

With the success of the ZX Spectrum Tangerine&#x27;s backers suggested a home computer and Tangerine formed &quot;Oric Products International Ltd&quot; to develop and release the Oric-1 in 1983. A series of Oric computers (including the Oric Atmos) followed through to 1987.

On 13 October 1983 the factory of Kenure Plastics in Berkshire, where the Oric-1 was manufactured, suffered a fire causing &quot;several thousand pounds worth of damage&quot;, in which around 7,000 Oric machines were destroyed. The factory was rebuilt, minus a considerable stock of bits (including 15,000 old ROMs) that went to make up the Oric-1. In the meantime production was said to have restarted within 24 hours in a new factory. Just a day later, a neighbouring warehouse went up in flames. Police were said at the time to suspect that the arsonist got the wrong place first time round. It was about this time, too, that Tansoft moved to co-exist with Oric Research at the Techno Park, Cambridge.

About 160,000 Oric-1s were sold in the UK in 1983 with another 50,000 sold in France (where it was the top-selling machine that year). Although not the 350,000 predicted, it was enough for Oric International to be bought out by Edenspring and given £4m in funding. This enabled the release of the Oric Atmos, an improved successor to the Oric-1 which added a true keyboard and improved ROM.

Although the Atmos failed to turn around Oric&#x27;s fortunes, in early 1985 they announced several forthcoming models, including an IBM-compatible and an MSX-compatible. On 1 February they demonstrated the Oric Stratos/IQ164 at the Frankfurt Computer Show; on the 2nd however, Edenspring put Oric International into receivership with Tansoft, by then a company in its own right, following in May.

French company &quot;Eureka &quot;bought the remains of Oric and, after renaming itself, continued to produce the Stratos under that name, followed by the Oric Telestrat in late 1986.

In December 1987 after announcing the Telestrat 2, Oric International went into receivership for the second and final time.

<text>The command , an abbreviation of &quot; change owner&quot;, is used on Unix and Unix-like operating systems to change the owner of file system files and directories. Unprivileged (regular) users who wish to change the group membership of a file that they own may use .

The ownership of any file in the system may only be altered by a super-user. A user cannot &quot;give away&quot; ownership of a file, even when the user owns it. Similarly, only a member of a group can change a file&#x27;s &quot;group ID&quot; to that group.

The version of codice_1 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by David MacKenzie and Jim Meyering.

The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

<doc id="346611" wikidata="Q336779" url="?curid=346611" title="Axiom of countability">
<text>In mathematics, an axiom of countability is a property of certain mathematical objects that asserts the existence of a countable set with certain properties. Without such an axiom, such a set might not provably exist.

==Important examples==
Important countability axioms for topological spaces include:
*sequential space: a set is closed if and only if every convergent sequence in the set has its limit point in the set
*first-countable space: every point has a countable neighbourhood basis (local base)
*second-countable space: the topology has a countable base
*separable space: there exists a countable dense subset
*Lindelöf space: every open cover has a countable subcover
*σ-compact space: there exists a countable cover by compact spaces

==Relationships with each other==
These axioms are related to each other in the following ways:
*Every first-countable space is sequential.
*Every second-countable space is first countable, separable, and Lindelöf.
*Every σ-compact space is Lindelöf.
*Every metric space is first countable.
*For metric spaces, second-countability, separability, and the Lindelöf property are all equivalent.

==Related concepts==
Other examples of mathematical objects obeying axioms of countability include sigma-finite measure spaces, and lattices of countable type.

<text>Swazi culture is the way of life and customs of the Swazi people through various historical stages. The culture of Swazi people involves music, food, religion, architecture, and kinship, among many other things. The Swazi people are composed of various Nguni clans who speak the Nguni language siSwati. These people mostly reside in Eswatini and South Africa. Presently, Swazi people may also include citizens of Eswatini. In Eswatini, one of the most visible features of cultural identity is the traditional political structure of the nation and the home. In the national level, the Ngwenyama (the &quot;Lion&quot;, or King) is considered the head of the nation alongside the Ndlovukati (the &quot;She-Elephant&quot;, or Queen Mother) who is the spiritual leader of the nation. National cultural events often involve the Ngwenyama or Ndlovukati. At home, the patriarch of the family is the head and often practices polygamy. This headman, usually referred to as &quot;umnumzane&quot; is central to all activities of the home. A group of homes forming a community and the land they reside on forms a chiefdom or &quot;umphakatsi&quot;. Several chiefdoms form an inkhundla which then belongs of a regional division of the country. This connects the older traditional leadership structures to more modern forms of government.

There are national cultural events such as &quot;umhlanga&quot;, &quot;emaganu&quot; and &quot;incwala&quot; which take place at Royal residences of the Ngwenyama and Ndlovukati. Local cultural events in communities or &quot;imiphakatsi&quot;, take place at the residence of the chief also called &quot;emphakatsini&quot;. Weddings, funerals and religious events are usually carried out at family homesteads where neighbors are usually invited to partake.

==Swazi kinship==
The principal Swazi social unit is the homestead, a traditional beehive hut thatched with dry grass. In a polygamous homestead, each wife has her own hut and yard surrounded by reed fences. There are three structures for sleeping, cooking, and storage (brewing beer). In larger homesteads there are also structures used as bachelors&#x27; quarters and guest accommodation.

Central to the traditional homestead is the cattle byre, or kraal, a circular area enclosed by large logs inter-spaced with branches. The cattle byre has ritual as well as practical significance as a store of wealth and symbol of prestige. It contains sealed grain pits. Facing the cattle byre is the great hut which is occupied by the mother of the headman.

The headman is central to all homestead affairs and he is often polygamous. He leads through example and advises his wives on all social affairs of the home as well as seeing to the larger survival of the family. He also spends time socialising with the young boys, who are often his sons or close relatives, advising them on the expectations of growing up and manhood.

==Traditional healers==
The Sangoma is a traditional diviner chosen by the ancestors of that particular family. The training of the Sangoma is called &quot;kwetfwasa&quot;. At the end of the training, a graduation ceremony takes place where all the local sangoma come together for feasting and dancing. The diviner is consulted for various reasons, such the cause of sickness or even death. His diagnosis is based on &quot;kubhula&quot;, a process of communication, through trance, with the natural super-powers. The Inyanga (a medical and pharmaceutical specialist in western terms) possesses the bone throwing skill (&quot;kushaya ematsambo&quot;) used to determine the cause of the sickness.

==Incwala==
The most important cultural event in Eswatini is the Incwala ceremony. It is held on the fourth day after the full moon nearest the longest day, 21 December. Incwala is often translated in English as &#x27;first fruits ceremony&#x27;, but the King&#x27;s tasting of the new harvest is only one aspect among many in this long pageant. Incwala is best translated as Kingship Ceremony. When there is no king, there is no Incwala. It is high treason for any other person to hold an Incwala.

Every Swazi may take part in the public parts of the Incwala. The climax of the event is the fourth day of the Big Incwala. The key figures are the King, Queen Mother, royal wives and children, the royal governors (indunas), the chiefs, the regiments, and the &quot;bemanti&quot; or &quot;water people&quot;.

==Umhlanga==
Eswatini&#x27;s best-known cultural event is the annual Umhlanga Reed Dance. In the eight-day ceremony, girls cut reeds, present them to the Queen Mother and then dance. (There is no formal competition.) It is done in late August or early September. Only childless, unmarried girls can take part. The aims of the ceremony are to preserve girls&#x27; chastity, provide tribute labour for the Queen Mother and to encourage solidarity by working together. The royal family appoints a commoner maiden to be &quot;induna&quot; (captain) of the girls and she announces over the radio the dates of the ceremony. She will be an expert dancer and knowledgeable on royal protocol. One of the King&#x27;s daughters will be her counterpart.

The Reed Dance today is not an ancient ceremony but a development of the old &quot;umchwasho&quot; custom. In &quot;umchwasho&quot;, all young girls were placed in a female age-regiment. If any girl became pregnant outside of marriage, her family paid a fine of one cow to the local chief. After a number of years, when the girls had reached a marriageable age, they would perform labour service for the Queen Mother, ending with dancing and feasting. The country was under the chastity rite of &quot;umchwasho&quot; until 19 August 2005.

==Arts and crafts==
Swazi art varies from pottery to jewellery among many other things. Historically Swazi people have made jewellery and clothing items from beads. An example of this is &quot;ligcebesha&quot;, a colourful necklace and &quot;indlamu&quot; and colourful skirt for girls. Historical pottery in Eswatini includes mostly clay pots that are used for carrying water, beer cooking and decorations. These clay pots are called &quot;tindziwo&quot;. Wooden sculptures were also very popular as utensils, for example &quot;umcwembe&quot; used for serving meat. Swazis also made a lot of items using special grasses. These include grass mats called &quot;emacansi&quot; and &quot;tihlantsi&quot;. Other grass items are brooms, baskets among others.

Eswatini is also known for a strong presence in the handcrafts industry. The formalised handcraft businesses of Eswatini employ over 2,500 people, many of whom are women (per TechnoServe Swaziland Handcrafts Impact Study,&quot; February 2011). The products are unique and reflect the culture of Eswatini, ranging from housewares, to artistic decorations, to complex glass, stone, or wood artwork.

==Sports culture in Eswatini==

The sport of football is the most popular sport in the country of Eswatini. It is run by the Eswatini Football Association. The association administers the Eswatini national football team, as well as the Premier League of Eswatini.

<doc id="346620" wikidata="Q746782" url="?curid=346620" title="Nemanjić dynasty">
<text>The House of Nemanjić (, Немањићи; Nemanjić, Nemanjići, ) was the most prominent Serbian dynasty of Serbia in the Middle Ages. This princely, royal and imperial house produced twelve Serbian monarchs, who ruled between 1166 and 1371.

Its progenitor was Stefan Nemanja, scion of a cadet branch of the Vukanović dynasty (1101–1166). After Nemanja, all monarchs used &quot;Stefan&quot; as a personal name, or a ruler&#x27;s name, a tradition adopted for the royal pretensions. The monarchs began as Grand Princes, and with the crowning of Stefan Nemanjić in 1217, the realm was promoted to a Kingdom, and the Serbian Orthodox Church was established in 1219. In 1346, Stefan Dušan was crowned &quot;Emperor of the Serbs and Greeks&quot;, and the Archbishopric of Serbia was elevated to a Patriarchate.

The dynasty&#x27;s rule in Serbia ended in 1371, with the death of childless Stefan Uroš V (r. 1355–1371). This led to the fall of the Serbian Empire. Provincial lords took control of their provinces. The last remaining members of the House of Nemanjić were John Uroš, ruler of Thessaly, titular emperor of the Serbians and Greeks, who died c. 1422-23, and his younger brother, Stefan Uroš, ruler of Pharsalos. Nemanjić descent survived only through maternal lines in several Serbian houses.

==Background==
In the 8th century, the Vlastimirović Dynasty established the Serbian Principality. The state disintegrated after the death of the last known Vlastimirid ruler Časlav of Serbia around 940/960s and the Byzantines annexed the region and held it for a century, until 1040 when the Serbs under the Vojislavljević Dynasty revolted in &quot;Duklja&quot; (Pomorje). In the 1090s, the Vukanović Dynasty established the Serbian Grand Principality, and since the mid-12th century Stari Ras became undisputably under Serbian control, becoming centre of defence and residency for the Serbian Principality. In 1166, Stefan Nemanja took the throne, marking the beginning of Serbia, henceforth under the rule of the Nemanjići (Vukanović branch).

==Serbia under the Nemanjić dynasty==

Serbia reached its height of power during the Nemanjić dynasty. The Serbian Kingdom was proclaimed in 1217, leading to the establishment of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1219. In the same year Saint Sava published the first constitution in Serbia: St. Sava&#x27;s Nomocanon.Tsar Stefan Dušan proclaimed the Serbian Empire in 1346. During Dušan&#x27;s rule, Serbia reached its territorial, political, and economical peak, proclaiming itself as the successor of the Byzantine Empire, and was the most powerful Balkan state of that time. Dušan enacted an extensive constitution, known as Dušan&#x27;s Code, opened new trade routes, strengthened the state&#x27;s economy, but its society&#x27;s integration was unfinished and not unified enough until Ottoman invasion. Serbian medieval political identity has been profoundly shaped by the rule of this dynasty and its accomplishments, that were supported and cultivated by the Serbian Orthodox Church.

Stefan Dušan attempted to organize a Crusade with the Pope against the threatening Turks, but he died suddenly in December 1355. He was succeeded by his son Uroš, called &quot;the Weak&quot;, a term that might also apply to the state of the empire, which slowly slid into a feudal fragmentation. This was a period marked by the rise of a new threat: the Ottoman Turk sultanate, which spread from Asia to Europe conquering Byzantium and then the other states in the Balkans.

==Members==
===Monarchs===
The Nemanjić dynasty ruled the Serb lands between ca. 1166 up to 1371.

The Nemanjic family helped Eastern Orthodoxy to spread around the Balkans. They were known for being the builders of a lot of Orthodox monasteries. Religion was one of the main reasons they were one of the most important dynasties in Serbia. Because of them Serbia is very rich in historical monuments and churches. The well known monasteries they built include: monastery of Žiča, Studenica Monastery, Gračanica Monastery, Ljubostinja, Banjska Monastery, Mileševa Monastery, Hilandar, Đurđevi stupovi, Sopoćani, Visoki Dečani, Gradac Monastery, Morača (monastery), Gorioč Monastery, Monastery of the Holy Archangels, Matejče Monastery, Our Lady of Ljeviš, Papraća Monastery, Tronoša Monastery, Rača monastery, Arilje monastery, Bešenovo Monastery, Davidovica monastery and many more.

<doc id="346624" wikidata="Q382571" url="?curid=346624" title="Association (object-oriented programming)">
<text>In object-oriented programming, association defines a relationship between classes of objects that allows one object instance to cause another to perform an action on its behalf. This relationship is structural, because it specifies that objects of one kind are connected to objects of another and does not represent behaviour.
In generic terms, the causation is usually called &quot;sending a message&quot;, &quot;invoking a method&quot; or &quot;calling a member function&quot; to the controlled object. Concrete implementation usually requires the requesting object to invoke a &quot;method&quot; or &quot;member function&quot; using a reference or pointer to the memory location of the controlled object.

The objects that are related via the association are considered to act in a role with respect to the association, if object&#x27;s current state in the active situation allows the other associated objects to use the object in the manner specified by the role. A role can be used to distinguish two objects of the same class when describing its use in the context of the association. A role describes the &quot;public&quot; aspects of an object with respect to an association.

The ends of the association can have all the characteristics of a property:

* They can have a &quot;multiplicity&quot;, expressed by a lower and an upper limit in the form of &quot;lowerLimit..upperLimit&quot;.
* You can have a &quot;name&quot;.
* You can declare a &quot;visibility&quot;.
* You can specify whether the end of the association is &quot;ordered&quot; and / or &quot;unique&quot;.

<doc id="346641" wikidata="Q1471315" url="?curid=346641" title="Vanden Plas Princess">
<text>The Princess is a badge engineered variant of the Austin A99 Westminster, manufactured by BMC from 1959 to 1968 and marketed under the Vanden Plas marque.

The model was launched in October 1959 under the name Princess 3-litre. From July 1960, these vehicles bore the name Vanden Plas Princess 3-litre, Vanden Plas having become a badge-engineered brand in its own right instead of being known as a coachbuilder for cars of other manufacturers. The 3-litre was superseded by the Vanden Plas Princess 4-litre R in 1964.

The Princess was a great deal smaller and less than 44 per cent of the price of the older Princess IV Saloon, which was also to continue until 1968.

==Princess 3-litre==

The 3-litre was largely identical to the Pininfarina-designed Austin A99 Westminster and Wolseley 6/99 which used the same chassis and body. The Princess was given its own identity with a special Vanden Plas grille (fairly square, with a thick surround and vertical slats), round headlamps, and horn grilles on the front. The interior was lavish in typical Vanden Plas style, featuring burr walnut wood trim, leather seats and panels, and high-quality carpeting. A division between the driver and the rear compartment was an optional extra. Initially, it was powered by BMC&#x27;s 3-litre C-Series engine, developing .

A Vanden Plas Princess 3-litre with automatic transmission was tested by the British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1961 and had a top speed of . It could accelerate from 0- in 16.1 seconds while fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1,467 including taxes.

This model was replaced in 1961 by the Vanden Plas Princess 3-litre Mark II. Styling was similar but the wheelbase was two inches (5 cm) longer and anti-roll bars were added to the suspension at both ends of the car. The engine was uprated to . Better brakes were fitted, and interior improvements included built-in drop-down &quot;picnic tables&quot; for the rear seat passengers. Options now included &quot;Smith&#x27;s air-conditioning&quot;.

===Engine specifications===
This model was discontinued in 1964 and replaced by a new Rolls-Royce powered model.
&#x27;

==Vanden Plas Princess R==

The Vanden Plas Princess R with its Rolls-Royce all-aluminium 175 bhp engine was announced in August 1964. With an unusually high power to weight ratio the car gave easy cruising at 90+ mph and was capable of 112 mph.

In addition to exterior alterations, the R featured an 6 cylinder aluminium Rolls-Royce FB60 engine, a short-stroke version of the B series engine: 4, 6 and 8 cylinder units of which more than 30,000 had already been produced. The 6-cylinder engine weighed only . The engine resulted from more than two years technical collaboration between BMC and Rolls-Royce, and featured a cubic capacity of. Over-square: bore was , stroke ; with a 7.8:1 compression ratio its output was @4,800 rpm. Twin SU carburettors were fitted. Both block and head were aluminium, tappets were hydraulic self-adjusting operating on overhead inlet and side exhaust valves. The counterbalanced crankshaft ran in seven bearings.

The 4-litre R featured polished walnut fascia padded top and bottom, leather upholstered seats with fully reclinable backs and deployable polished picnic tables for the rear passengers. A new automatic transmission was provided, Borg-Warner model 8, its first use in a British car and Hydrosteer variable ratio power steering accompanied wider tyres. Externally the fog lamps were moved up by the grille, and rear tailfins were replaced with small corner-ridges.

===Engine specifications===
===Pricing===
The background to the pricing was that from April 1961 tax relief on company cars was allowed only up to £2,000.

The new car was priced on a par with the Jaguar Mark X (albeit only the manual transmission model of the Jaguar) and 50 per cent more than its apparent predecessor the 3-litre car. It was a major change of market positioning aimed at the growing prestige and executive market in Europe and the United States. However, its close appearance to its predecessor and its pricing (near to that of the Jaguar, which was bigger with a far more advanced chassis design and more prestigious, though itself without a useful market in the United States), resulted in slow sales.

* £1,346 (discontinued Vanden Plas Princess Mark II)
* £1,994 Vanden Plas Princess 4-litre R
* £2,022 Jaguar Mark X
* £5,517 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud III

===Production===
Joint production aimed at 12,000 annually, though actual production was never more than a fraction of this. Final assembly and hand finishing took place at the Vanden Plas works in Kingsbury London.

The Vanden Plas Princess 4-litre R remained in production until 1968, just ahead of BMC&#x27;s merge into British Leyland. 6,687 vehicles were produced at Kingsbury and an additional 312 C.K.D. kits were exported to South Africa bringing total production to 6,999 units. It was the only mass-produced civilian vehicle from another manufacturer ever to use a Rolls-Royce engine.

The late Queen Elizabeth ll owned an estate model of the Vanden Plas Princess, with an estimated production of 4-7.

==Rolls-Royce Java==

This car was a result of a joint BMC / Rolls-Royce project for a smaller Bentley code-named Java. Prototypes were made using the Austin-engineered central portion of the Vanden Plas, with restyled Rolls-Royce and Bentley panels front and rear. Neither of these models made it into production. Rolls-Royce withdrew from the venture. They had been covering the possibility that the survival of their motor car division might depend on providing a relatively compact mass-produced Rolls-Royce. However 1965&#x27;s introduction of the Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow was a success.

<text>The Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) is a standardized test that is part of the admissions process for many graduate schools in the United States and Canada and a few other countries. The GRE is owned and administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS). The test was established in 1936 by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.

According to ETS, the GRE aims to measure verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, analytical writing, and critical thinking skills that have been acquired over a long period of learning. The content of the GRE consists of certain specific data analysis or interpretation, arguments and reasoning, algebra, geometry, arithmetic, and vocabulary sections. The GRE General Test is offered as a computer-based exam administered at testing centers and institution owned or authorized by Prometric. In the graduate school admissions process, the level of emphasis that is placed upon GRE scores varies widely among schools and departments. The importance of a GRE score can range from being a mere admission formality to an important selection factor.

The GRE was significantly overhauled in August 2011, resulting in an exam that is adaptive on a section-by-section basis, rather than question by question, so that the performance on the first verbal and math sections determines the difficulty of the second sections presented (excluding the experimental section). Overall, the test retained the sections and many of the question types from its predecessor, but the scoring scale was changed to a 130 to 170 scale (from a 200 to 800 scale).

The cost to take the test is US$205, although ETS will reduce the fee under certain circumstances. It also provides financial aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship. ETS does not release scores that are older than five years, although graduate program policies on the acceptance of scores older than five years will vary.

Once almost universally required for admission to Ph.D. science programs in the U.S., its use for that purpose has fallen precipitously.

==History==

The Graduate Record Examinations was &quot;initiated in 1936 as a joint experiment in higher education by the graduate school deans of four Ivy League universities and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.&quot;

The first universities to experiment with the test on their students were Harvard University, Yale University, Princeton University and Columbia University. The University of Wisconsin was the first public university to ask their students to take the test in 1938. It was first given to students at the University of Iowa in 1940, where it was analyzed by psychologist Dewey Stuit. It was first taken by students at Texas Tech University in 1942. In 1943, it was taken by students at Michigan State University, where it was analyzed by Paul Dressel. It was taken by over 45,000 students applying to 500 colleges in 1948.

&quot;Until the Educational Testing Service was established in January, 1948, the Graduate Record Examination remained a project of the Carnegie Foundation.&quot;

=== 2011 revision ===
In 2006, ETS announced plans to make significant changes in the format of the GRE. Planned changes for the revised GRE included a longer testing time, a departure from computer-adaptive testing, a new grading scale, and an enhanced focus on reasoning skills and critical thinking for both the quantitative and qualitative sections.

On April 2, 2007, ETS announced the decision to cancel plans for revising the GRE. The announcement cited concerns over the ability to provide clear and equal access to the new test after the planned changes as an explanation for the cancellation. The ETS stated, however, that they did plan &quot;to implement many of the planned test content improvements in the future&quot;, although specific details regarding those changes were not initially announced.

Changes to the GRE took effect on November 1, 2007, as ETS started to include new types of questions in the exam. The changes mostly centered on &quot;fill in the blank&quot; type answers for the mathematics section that requires the test-taker to fill in the blank directly, without being able to choose from a multiple choice list of answers. ETS announced plans to introduce two of these new types of questions in each quantitative section, while the majority of questions would be presented in the regular format.

Since January 2008, the Reading Comprehension within the verbal sections has been reformatted, passages&#x27; &quot;line numbers will be replaced with highlighting when necessary in order to focus the test taker on specific information in the passage&quot; to &quot;help students more easily find the pertinent information in reading passages.&quot;

In December 2009, ETS announced plans to move forward with significant revisions to the GRE in 2011. Changes include a new 130–170 scoring scale, the elimination of certain question types such as antonyms and analogies, the addition of an online calculator, and the elimination of the CAT format of question-by-question adjustment, in favor of a section by section adjustment.

On August 1, 2011, the Revised GRE General test replaced General GRE test. The revised GRE is said to be better by design and provides a better test taking experience. The new types of questions in the revised format are intended to test the skills needed in graduate and business schools programs. From July 2012 onwards GRE announced an option for users to customize their scores called ScoreSelect.

===Before October 2002===

The earliest versions of the GRE tested only for verbal and quantitative ability. For a number of years before October 2002, the GRE had a separate Analytical Ability section which tested candidates on logical and analytical reasoning abilities. This section was replaced by the Analytical Writing Assessment.

==Structure==
The computer-based GRE General Test consists of six sections. The first section is always the analytical writing section involving separately timed issue and argument tasks. The next five sections consist of two verbal reasoning sections, two quantitative reasoning sections, and either an experimental or research section. These five sections may occur in any order. The experimental section does not count towards the final score but is not distinguished from the scored sections. Unlike the computer adaptive test before August 2011, the GRE General Test is a multistage test, where the examinee&#x27;s performance on earlier sections determines the difficulty of subsequent sections, using a technique known as computer-adaptive testing. This format allows the examined person to freely move back and forth between questions within each section, and the testing software allows the user to &quot;mark&quot; questions within each section for later review if time remains. The entire testing procedure lasts about 3 hours 45 minutes. One-minute breaks are offered after each section and a 10-minute break after the third section.

The paper-based GRE General Test also consists of six sections. The analytical writing is split up into two sections, one section for each issue and argument task. The next four sections consist of two verbal and two quantitative sections in varying order. There is no experimental section on the paper-based test.

===Verbal section===
The computer-based verbal sections assess reading comprehension, critical reasoning, and vocabulary usage. The verbal test is scored on a scale of 130–170, in 1-point increments. (Before August 2011, the scale was 200–800, in 10-point increments.) In a typical examination, each verbal section consists of 20 questions to be completed in 30 minutes. Each verbal section consists of about 6 text completion, 4 sentence equivalence, and 10 critical reading questions. The changes in 2011 include a reduced emphasis on rote vocabulary knowledge and the elimination of antonyms and analogies. Text completion items have replaced sentence completions and new reading question types allowing for the selection of multiple answers were added.

===Quantitative section===
The computer-based quantitative sections assess knowledge and reasoning skills taught in most Mathematics and Statistics courses in secondary schools. The quantitative test is scored on a scale of 130–170, in 1-point increments (Before August 2011 the scale was 200–800, in 10-point increments). In a typical examination, each quantitative section consists of 20 questions to be completed in 35 minutes. Each quantitative section consists of about 8 quantitative comparisons, 9 problem solving items, and 3 data interpretation questions. The changes in 2011 include the addition of numeric entry items requiring the examinee to fill in the blank and multiple-choice items requiring the examinee to select multiple correct responses.
* Arithmetic:
** Integer, Divisibility rule, Integer factorization, Prime number, Remainder, Parity
** Exponentiation, nth root
** Estimation, Percentage, Ratio, Rate, Absolute value, Number line, Decimal representation, Sequence
* Algebra:

** Factorization, Expression
** Relation, Function, Equation, Inequality
** Equation solving, Linear equation, Quadratic equation
** System of linear equations
** Analytic geometry, Graph of a function, Zero of a function, Y-intercept, Slope
* Geometry:
** Parallel, Perpendicular
** Circle
** Triangle, Isosceles triangle, Equilateral triangle, Special right triangle
** Quadrilateral, Polygon
** Congruence, Similarity
** Polyhedron
** Area, Perimeter, Volume
** Pythagorean theorem
** Angle, Degree
* Data analysis:

** Line chart, Bar chart, Pie chart, Box plot, Scatter plot, Frequency
** Probability, Independence
** Conditional probability
** Random variable, Probability distribution, Normal distribution
** Counting method, Combination, Permutation, Venn diagram

===Analytical writing section===
The analytical writing section consists of two different essays, an &quot;issue task&quot; and an &quot;argument task&quot;. The writing section is graded on a scale of 0–6, in half-point increments. The essays are written on a computer using a word processing program specifically designed by ETS. The program allows only basic computer functions and does not contain a spell-checker or other advanced features. Each essay is scored by at least two readers on a six-point holist scale. If the two scores are within one point, the average of the scores is taken. If the two scores differ by more than a point, a third reader examines the response.

====Issue Task====
The test taker is given 30 minutes to write an essay about a selected topic. Issue topics are selected from a pool of questions, which the GRE Program has published in its entirety. Individuals preparing for the GRE may access the pool of tasks on the ETS website.

====Argument Task====
The test taker will be given an argument (i.e. a series of facts and considerations leading to a conclusion) and asked to write an essay that critiques the argument. Test takers are asked to consider the argument&#x27;s logic and to make suggestions about how to improve the logic of the argument. Test takers are expected to address the logical flaws of the argument and not provide a personal opinion on the subject. The time allotted for this essay is 30 minutes. The Arguments are selected from a pool of topics, which the GRE Program has published in its entirety. Individuals preparing for the GRE may access the pool of tasks on the ETS website.

===Experimental section===
The experimental section, which can be either verbal or quantitative, contains new questions ETS is considering for future use. Although the experimental section does not count towards the test-taker&#x27;s score, it is unidentified and appears identical to the scored sections. Because test takers have no definite way of knowing which section is experimental, it is typically advised that test takers try their best and be focused on every section. Sometimes an identified research section at the end of the test is given instead of the experimental section. There is no experimental section on the paper-based GRE.

==Scoring==
An examinee can miss one or more questions on a multiple-choice section and still receive a perfect score of 170. Likewise, even if no question is answered correctly, 130 is the lowest possible score. Verbal and quantative reasoning scores are given in one-point increments, and analytical writing scores are given in half-point increments on a scale of 0 to 6.

===Scaled score percentiles===
The percentiles for the current General test and the concordance with the prior format are as follows. According to interpretive data published by ETS, from July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2018 about 2 million people have taken the test. Based on performance of individuals the mean and standard deviation of verbal section were 150.24 and 8.44. Whereas, mean and standard deviation for quantitative section were 153.07 and 9.24. Analytical writing has a mean of 3.55 with a standard deviation of 0.86.

&quot;Field-wise distribution&quot; of test takers is &quot;limited to those who earned their college degrees up to two years before the test date.&quot; ETS provides no score data for &quot;non-traditional&quot; students who have been out of school more than two years, although its own report &quot;RR-99-16&quot; indicated that 22% of all test takers in 1996 were over the age of 30.

==GRE Subject Tests==
In addition to the General Test, there are also three GRE Subject Tests testing knowledge in the specific areas of Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology. The length of each exam is 170 minutes.

In the past, subject tests were also offered in the areas of Computer Science, Economics, Revised Education, Engineering, English Literature, French, Geography, Geology, German, History, Music, Political Science, Sociology, Spanish, and Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology. In April 1998, the Revised Education and Political Science exams were discontinued. In April 2000, the History and Sociology exams were discontinued; with Economics, Engineering, Music, and Geology being discontinued in April 2001. The Computer Science exam was discontinued after April 2013. Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology was discontinued in December 2016. The GRE Biology Test and GRE Literature in English Test tests were discontinued in May 2021. The GRE Chemistry Test was discontinued in May 2023.

==Use in admissions==

Many graduate schools in the United States require GRE results as part of the admissions process. The GRE is a standardized test intended to measure all graduates&#x27; abilities in tasks of general academic nature (regardless of their fields of specialization) and the extent to which undergraduate education has developed their verbal skills, quantitative skills, and abstract thinking.

In addition to GRE scores, admission to graduate schools depends on several other factors, such as GPA, letters of recommendation, and statements of purpose. Furthermore, unlike other standardized admissions tests (such as the SAT, LSAT, and MCAT), the use and weight of GRE scores vary considerably not only from school to school, but also from department to department and program to program. For instance, most business schools and economics programs require very high GRE or GMAT scores for entry, while engineering programs are known to allow more score variation. Liberal arts programs may only consider the applicant&#x27;s verbal score, while mathematics and science programs may only consider quantitative ability. Some schools use the GRE in admissions decisions, but not in funding decisions; others use it for selection of scholarship and fellowship candidates, but not for admissions. In some cases, the GRE may be a general requirement for graduate admissions imposed by the university, while particular departments may not consider the scores at all. Graduate schools will typically provide the average scores of previously admitted students and information about how the GRE is considered in admissions and funding decisions. In some cases, programs have hard cut off requirements for the GRE; for example, the Yale Economics PhD program requires a minimum quantitative score of 160 to apply. The best way to ascertain how a particular school or program evaluates a GRE score in the admissions process is to contact the person in charge of graduate admissions for the specific program in question.

In February 2016, the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law became the first law school to accept either the GRE or the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) from all applicants. The college made the decision after conducting a study showing that the GRE is a valid and reliable predictor of students&#x27; first-term law school grades.

In the spring of 2017, Harvard Law School announced it was joining University of Arizona Law in accepting the GRE in addition to the LSAT from applicants to its three-year J.D. program.

After a trial cycle of GRE–free admissions for Fall 2021, University of California, Berkeley voted to drop the GRE requirement for most graduate program admissions for Fall 2022 as well. University of Michigan, Ann Arbor shortly followed announcing that they would drop the GRE requirements for Ph.D. admissions beginning with the 2022–23 admissions cycle. By late 2022, the trend had intensified.

===MBA===

GRE score can be used for taking admission in MBA in foreign colleges.

The GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) is a computer-adaptive standardized test in mathematics and the English language for measuring aptitude to succeed academically in graduate business studies.
Business schools commonly use the test as one of many selection criteria for admission into an MBA program. Starting in 2009, many business schools began accepting the GRE in lieu of a GMAT score. Policies varied widely for several years. However, as of the 2014–2015 admissions season, most business schools accept both tests equally. Either a GMAT score or a GRE score can be submitted for an application to an MBA program. Business schools also accept either score for their other (non-MBA) Masters and Ph.D. programs.

The primary issue on which business school test acceptance policies vary is in how old a GRE or GMAT score can be before it is no longer accepted. The standard is that scores cannot be more than 5 years old (e.g., Wharton, MIT Sloan, Columbia Business School).

=== Intellectual clubs ===
Some GRE scores are accepted as qualifying evidence to intellectual clubs such as Intertel, Mensa and the Triple Nine Society, the minimum passing score depending on the selectivity of the society and the time period when the test was taken. Intertel accepts scores in the 99th percentile obtained after 2011, while Mensa does not accept any score post-September 2001.

==Preparation==
A variety of resources are available for those wishing to prepare for the GRE. ETS provides preparation software called PowerPrep, which contains two practice tests of retired questions, as well as further practice questions and review material. Since the software replicates both the test format and the questions used, it can be useful to predict the actual GRE scores. ETS does not license their past questions to any other company, making them the only source for official retired material. ETS used to publish the &quot;BIG BOOK&quot; which contained a number of actual GRE questions; however, this publishing was abandoned. Several companies provide courses, books, and other unofficial preparation materials.

Some students taking the GRE use a test preparation company. Students who do not use these courses often rely on material from university text books, GRE preparation books, sample tests, and free web resources.

==Testing locations==
While the general and subject tests are held at many undergraduate institutions, the computer-based general test can be held in over 1000 locations with appropriate technological accommodations. In the United States, students in major cities or from large universities will usually find a nearby test center, while those in more isolated areas may have to travel a few hours to an urban or university location. Many industrialized countries also have test centers, but at times test-takers must cross country borders.

==Criticism==

===Bias===

====Algorithmic bias====

Critics have claimed that the computer-adaptive methodology may discourage some test takers since the question difficulty changes with performance. For example, if the test-taker is presented with remarkably easy questions halfway into the exam, they may infer that they are not performing well, which will influence their abilities as the exam continues, even though question difficulty is subjective. By contrast, standard testing methods may discourage students by giving them more difficult items earlier on.

Critics have also stated that the computer-adaptive method of placing more weight on the first several questions is biased against test takers who typically perform poorly at the beginning of a test due to stress or confusion before becoming more comfortable as the exam continues. On the other hand, standard fixed-form tests could equally be said to be &quot;biased&quot; against students with less testing stamina since they would need to be approximately twice the length of an equivalent computer adaptive test to obtain a similar level of precision.

====Implicit bias====

The GRE has also been subjected to the same racial bias criticisms that have been lodged against other admissions tests. In 1998, &quot;The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education&quot; noted that the mean score for black test-takers in 1996 was 389 on the verbal section, 409 on the quantitative section, and 423 on the analytic, while white test-takers averaged 496, 538, and 564, respectively. The National Association of Test Directors Symposia in 2004 stated a belief that simple mean score differences may not constitute evidence of bias unless the populations are known to be equal in ability. A more effective, accepted, and empirical approach is the analysis of differential test functioning, which examines the differences in item response theory curves for subgroups; the best approach for this is the DFIT framework.

===Weak indicator of graduate school performance===

The GREs are criticized for not being a true measure of whether a student will be successful in graduate school. Robert Sternberg (now of Cornell University; working at Yale University at the time of the study), a long-time critic of modern intelligence testing in general, found the GRE general test was weakly predictive of success in graduate studies in psychology. The strongest relationship was found for the now-defunct analytical portion of the exam.

The ETS published a report (&quot;What is the Value of the GRE?&quot;) that points out the predictive value of the GRE on a student&#x27;s index of success at the graduate level. The problem with earlier studies is the statistical phenomenon of restriction of range. A correlation coefficient is sensitive to the range sampled for the test. Specifically, if only students accepted to graduate programs are studied (in Sternberg &amp; Williams and other research), the relationship is occluded. Validity coefficients range from .30 to .45 between the GRE and both first year and overall graduate GPA in ETS&#x27; study.

Kaplan and Saccuzzo state that the criterion that the GRE best predicts is first-year grades in graduate school. However, this correlation is only in the high tens to low twenties. &quot;If the test correlates with a criterion at the .4 level, then it accounts for 16% of the variability in that criterion, with the other 84% resulting from unknown factors and errors&quot; (p. 303). Graduate schools may be placing too much importance on standardized tests rather than on factors that more fully account for graduate school success, such as a thesis-requiring Honours degree, prior research experience, GPAs, or work experience. While graduate schools do consider these areas, many times schools will not consider applicants that score below a current score of roughly 314 (1301 prior score). Kaplan and Saccuzzo also state that &quot;the GRE predict[s] neither clinical skill nor even the ability to solve real-world problems&quot; (p. 303).

In 2007, a study by a university found a correlation of .30 to .45 between the GRE and both first year and overall graduate GPA. The correlation between GRE score and graduate school completion rates ranged from .11 (for the now defunct analytical section) to .39 (for the GRE subject test). Correlations with faculty ratings ranged from .35 to .50.

===Historical susceptibility to cheating===
In May 1994, Kaplan, Inc warned ETS, in hearings before a New York legislative committee, that the small question pool available to the computer-adaptive test made it vulnerable to cheating. ETS assured investigators that it was using multiple sets of questions and that the test was secure. This was later discovered to be incorrect.

In December 1994, prompted by student reports of recycled questions, then Director of GRE Programs for Kaplan, Inc and current CEO of Knewton, Jose Ferreira, led a team of 22 staff members deployed to 9 U.S. cities to take the exam. Kaplan, Inc then presented ETS with 150 questions, representing 70–80% of the GRE. According to early news releases, ETS appeared grateful to Stanley H. Kaplan, Inc. for identifying the security problem. However, on December 31, ETS sued Kaplan, Inc. for violation of a federal electronic communications privacy act, copyright laws, breach of contract, fraud, and a confidentiality agreement signed by test-takers on test day. On January 2, 1995, an agreement was reached out of court.

Additionally, in 1994, the scoring algorithm for the computer-adaptive form of the GRE was discovered to be insecure. ETS acknowledged that Kaplan, Inc employees, led by Jose Ferreira, reverse-engineered key features of the GRE scoring algorithms. The researchers found that a test taker&#x27;s performance on the first few questions of the exam had a disproportionate effect on the test taker&#x27;s final score. To preserve the integrity of scores, ETS adopted a more sophisticated scoring algorithm.

<text>All Things Considered (ATC) is the flagship news program on the American network National Public Radio (NPR). It was the first news program on NPR, premiering on May 3, 1971. It is broadcast live on NPR affiliated stations in the United States, and worldwide through several different outlets, formerly including the NPR Berlin station in Germany. &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and &quot;Morning Edition&quot; were the highest rated public radio programs in the United States in 2002 and 2005. The show combines news, analysis, commentary, interviews, and special features, and its segments vary in length and style. &quot;ATC&quot; airs weekdays from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time (live) or Pacific Time (recorded with some updates; in Hawaii it airs as a fully recorded program) or from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. A weekend version of &quot;ATC&quot;, &quot;Weekend All Things Considered&quot;, airs on Saturdays and Sundays.

==Background==
&quot;ATC&quot; programming combines news, analysis, commentary, interviews, and special features broadcast live daily from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time (3 to 5 p.m. Central Time) (20:00 to 22:00 UTC), and is re-fed with updates until 10 p.m. ET (9 p.m. CT) or 7 p.m. PT (02:00 UTC). Broadcasts run about 105 minutes with local content interspersed in between to complete two hours. In 2005, &quot;ATC&quot; aired on over 560 radio stations and reached an audience of approximately 12 million listeners each weekday, making it the third most listened to radio program in the United States after &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; and &quot;Morning Edition&quot;. In September 2010, &quot;All Things Considered&quot; had an average quarter-hour audience of 1.8 million. &quot;ATC&quot; is co-hosted by rotating cast of regular anchors; current hosts include Ari Shapiro, Ailsa Chang, Mary Louise Kelly, and Juana Summers.

The first broadcast of &quot;ATC&quot; was fed to about 90 radio stations on May 3, 1971, with host Robert Conley. During the first week, these stations were not allowed to broadcast the feed &quot;live&quot; but could record it for later broadcast. The first story was about the march on Washington, D.C., and the growing anti–Vietnam War protests taking place there. NPR chose to place its inaugural daily newscast at the afternoon commute timeslot instead of the morning because many of its affiliates at that time did not sign on for the day until mid-morning or afterward. It was not until 1979, by which time most affiliates had expanded their broadcast days to begin at 6 a.m. or earlier, that NPR premiered &quot;Morning Edition&quot;.

Weekend All Things Considered (&quot;WATC&quot;) is a one-hour version of the show that premiered in 1974 and is broadcast on Saturdays and Sundays at 5 p.m. ET, currently hosted by Scott Detrow.

&quot;ATC&quot; was excluded from the NPR deal with Sirius Satellite Radio so as not to compete with local stations airing the show.

To coordinate the choice of interview partners in cultural coverage between &quot;ATC&quot; and other NPR shows (as of 2010: &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, the weekend editions, &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot;, and &quot;Tell Me More&quot;), NPR set up a &quot; list&quot; system around 2005, whereby the first show to declare interest in a particular guest can &quot;reserve&quot; that person.

On March 23, 2020, &quot;ATC&quot; launched The National Conversation, a live call-in show addressing listener questions about the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The program aired from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. ET on weeknights from the end of March through May 2020.

Similar to &quot;Up First&quot;, the podcast complement to the network&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and &quot;Weekend Edition&quot;, NPR launched &quot;Consider This&quot; as a podcast companion to &quot;ATC&quot; on June 29, 2020, with &quot;ATC&quot; hosts providing in-depth analysis of a single story each weekday afternoon. National podcast episodes are supplemented in select areas by additional local reporting and analysis from journalists at various NPR member stations, such as Dallas-based KERA. &quot;Consider This&quot; is also the successor to NPR&#x27;s weekday afternoon &quot;Coronavirus Daily&quot; podcast, which had published throughout the spring of 2020. It expanded to weekends on January 8, 2022, with episodes hosted by then-&quot;WATC&quot; host Michel Martin on Saturdays. The podcast&#x27;s weekend episode moved to Sundays in May 2023, and as of June 2023 is hosted by &quot;WATC&quot; host Scott Detrow.

==Format==
The format is less rigid than that of &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, with a wider array of type and length of stories. The length of stories tends to be greater than &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, with some stories lasting for almost 23 minutes. Certain types of personal interest stories are almost always covered within this limit; those relating to hard news or entertainment tend to last the standard three-and-a-half to four minutes.

The program begins with the familiar Don Voegeli theme song under a one-minute billboard of the stories to be covered during the hour. Then the standard five-minute NPR newscast is delivered from one minute to six minutes past the hour. The newscast offers a cutaway after three minutes (at four minutes past the hour), allowing stations to cover the last 2.5 minutes with evening rush-hour news and traffic reports. For those stations that run the newscast untouched, a 30-second music bed follows instead.

The first, or &quot;A&quot; segment, begins at :06:30 after the hour. It features important news stories, although not necessarily the most important news stories of the day. Often it is here that the most significant interviews or developing stories are placed. Segment A runs 11:29 in duration, and closes out at :18 after with a two-minute station break.

At :20:35 past the hour, &quot;ATC&quot; picks back up with Segment B. This segment, which runs 8:24, features more news and analysis, and often contains lighter stories and commentary. Segment B breaks for the half-hour at :29 past. The program goes into a one-minute local break.

At the bottom of the hour, &quot;ATC&quot; resumes with a &quot;host return&quot;. In the 30-second return, the host or hosts discuss what&#x27;s coming up in the remaining half-hour and intro the news. This is immediately followed by a 3:30 newscast which ends at :34 after the hour, followed by a one-minute local break.

Segment C kicks off at :35:35 past the hour, and runs 8:24. Long feature stories are heard here, or as many as three shorter stories or commentaries may be heard as well. Segment D occurs immediately after Segment C at :44 past the hour, and runs for four minutes. Segment D is a designated cutaway for stations to run local commentary or features in lieu of the national segment. Segment D ends at :48 after the hour, and another two-minute break ensues. Occasionally, the show will &quot;break format&quot; and place a long, 12-minute story in Segments C and D without a local cutaway.

Segment E starts at :50 after, and concludes the hour. The segment runs 8:09. Unlike &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, there is no set format for this segment, although usually the second hour will contain an arts, culture, or lighter news story in this segment. Other times, hard news otherwise not fitting in the program may be placed here.

Stations receive a preliminary rundown before each broadcast (usually a few minutes before 4:00 p.m. Eastern) denoting the timing and placement of stories so they can schedule local content as appropriate. This rundown is updated as stories change until the feed ends at 10 p.m. ET. As with &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, two hours of content are scheduled for each program. After 6 p.m. Eastern, the feed repeats the earlier hours for the Midwest and West Coast, although information is updated through the evening as appropriate.

==Awards==
Major awards won by the show include the Ohio State Award, the Peabody Award, the Overseas Press Club Award, the DuPont Award, the American Women in Radio and Television Award, and the Robert F. Kennedy Award. In 1993, the show was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame, the first public radio program to be given that honor.

In 2017, the first broadcast episode (from 1971) of &quot;All Things Considered&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress. Recordings in the collection are considered &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==International broadcasts==

ABC NewsRadio in Australia broadcasts a continuous hour of selected segments from each day&#x27;s program between 12:00 and 13:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time Monday to Friday. Segments A to D are edited together omitting local NPR news inserts.

NPR Berlin in Germany aired in the local German timeslot, live from the United States.

<doc id="346646" wikidata="Q1267645" url="?curid=346646" title="Danilo II (Archbishop of Serbs)">
<text>Danilo II () was the Archbishop of Serbs 1324 to 1337, under the rule of Kings Stephen Uroš III (1321–1331) and Dušan the Mighty (1331–1355, crowned Emperor in 1345). As a Serbian monk, he was also a chronicler, active in court and Church politics, holding the office during the zenith of the Nemanjić dynasty-era; he wrote many biographies which are considered part of the most notable medieval Serbian literature. He was proclaimed [[List of Serbian saints|Saint]] Danilo II (Свети Данило II) of the Serbian Orthodox Church, and is celebrated on the same day as Saint Ignatius of Antioch on .

==Life and work==

Born around 1270 in the župa of Pilot (present-day Pult, in northern Albania), his given name has not been recorded, only that he belonged to a Serbian noble family. He was endowed with a fine intellect and a noble disposition; he had received an excellent education at the hands of the most learned men in Medieval Serbia and in Byzantium. After his education, he joined the court of the Serbian king Stefan Milutin, which he left around 1300 to join the monastery of Končul on the Ibar river. After his novitiate, he went to Peć at the request of the Serbian archbishop Jevstatije, where he was made a presbyter priest. After that, he progressed quickly in the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Serbian Orthodox Church: first as abbot of Hilandar (), then as bishop of Banjska (1312–1315), and finally as archbishop from 1324 until his death in 1337. He died on 19 December 1337 and was buried in one of the churches he had built in the monastery of Peć, Our Lady Hodegetria.

Danilo wrote biographies of Serbian medieval kings and archbishops, including the biography of Jelena, the wife of King Stephen Uroš I of Serbia (1243–1276). His monumental work is referred to in the poetry of Serbian folklore as &quot;knjige starostavne&quot; (the ancient books) and &quot;knjige carostavne&quot; (the royal books). As a result of his work, many historical details concerning both the rulers of medieval Serbia and the members of the Nemanjić dynasty have been preserved.

==Legacy==

He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.

<doc id="346651" wikidata="Q213115" url="?curid=346651" title="Toyota Prius">
<text>The is a compact/small family liftback (supermini/subcompact sedan until 2003) produced by Toyota. The Prius has a hybrid drivetrain, combined with an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. Initially offered as a four-door sedan, it has been produced only as a five-door liftback since 2003.

The Prius was developed by Toyota to be the &quot;car for the 21st century&quot;; it was the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle, first going on sale in Japan in 1997 at all four Toyota Japan dealership chains, and subsequently introduced worldwide in 2000.

In 2011, Toyota expanded the Prius family to include the Prius v, an MPV, and the Prius c, a subcompact hatchback. The production version of the Prius plug-in hybrid was released in 2012. The second generation of the plug-in variant, the Prius Prime, was released in the U.S. in November 2016. The Prius family totaled global cumulative sales of 6.1 million units in January 2017, representing 61% of the 10 million hybrids sold worldwide by Toyota since 1997. Toyota sells the Prius in over 90 markets, with Japan and the United States being its largest markets.

== Etymology and terminology ==
 is a Latin word meaning &quot;first&quot;, &quot;original&quot;, &quot;superior&quot; or &quot;to go before&quot;.

In February 2011, Toyota USA asked the US public to decide on what the most proper plural form of Prius should be, with choices including Prien, Prii, Prium, Prius, or Priuses. The company announced on 20 February that &quot;Prii&quot; was the most popular choice, and the new official plural designation in the US.

In Latin &quot;prius&quot; is the neuter singular of the comparative form (&quot;prior&quot;, &quot;prior&quot;, &quot;prius&quot;) of an adjective with only comparative and superlative (the superlative being &quot;primus&quot;, &quot;prima&quot;, &quot;primum&quot;). As with all neuter words, the Latin plural is &quot;priora&quot;, but that brand name was used by the &quot;Lada Priora&quot; in 2007. Despite the &quot;official&quot; plural form used by Toyota USA, &quot;Priuses&quot; is widely used in English.

Beginning in September 2011, Toyota USA began using the following names to differentiate the original Prius from some newer members of the Prius family: the standard Prius became the Prius Liftback, the Prius v (known as the Prius α in Japan, and Prius + in Europe), the Prius Plug-in Hybrid, and the Prius c (called Toyota Aqua in Japan).

== First generation (XW10; 1997) ==


=== NHW10 (1997–2000) ===
In 1995, Toyota debuted a hybrid concept car at the Tokyo Motor Show, with testing following a year later. The first Prius, model NHW10, went on sale on 10 December 1997. The first-generation Prius (NHW10) was available only in Japan.

The first-generation Prius, at its launch, became the world&#x27;s first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid car. At its introduction in 1997, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award, and in 1998, it won the Automotive Researchers&#x27; and Journalists&#x27; Conference Car of the Year award in Japan.

Production commenced in December 1997 at the Takaoka plant in Toyota, Aichi, ending in February 2000 after cumulative production of 37,425 vehicles.

The NHW10 Prius styling originated from California designers, who were selected over competing designs from other Toyota design studios.

=== NHW11 (2000–2003) ===

The Prius NHW11 (sometimes referred to as &quot;Generation II&quot;) was the first Prius sold by Toyota outside of Japan, with sales in limited numbers beginning in the year 2000 in Asia, America, Europe and Australia. In the United States, the Prius was marketed between the smaller Corolla and the larger Camry, with a published retail price of . European sales began in September 2000. The official launch of the Prius in Australia occurred at the October 2001 Sydney Motor Show, although sales were slow until the NHW20 (XW20) model arrived. Toyota sold about 123,000 first-generation Priuses.

Production of the NHW11 model commenced in May 2000 at the Motomachi plant in Toyota, Aichi, and continued until June 2003 after 33,411 NHW11 vehicles had been produced. The vehicle was the second mass-produced hybrid on the American market, after the two-seat Honda Insight.

The NHW11 Prius became more powerful partly to satisfy the higher speeds and longer distances that Americans drive. Electric power steering was standard equipment. While the larger Prius could seat five, its battery pack restricted cargo space. The Prius was offered in the US in three trim packages: Standard, Base, and Touring. The US EPA (CARB) classified the car with an air pollution score of 3 out of 10 as an Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV). Prius owners were eligible for up to a federal tax deduction from their gross income. Toyota executives stated that with the Prius NHW10 model, the company had been losing money on each Prius sold, and with the NHW11 it was now breaking even.

== Second generation (XW20; 2003) ==


Presented at the April 2003 New York International Auto Show, for the 2004 US model year, the NHW20 Prius was a complete redesign. It became a compact liftback, sized between the Corolla and the Camry, with redistributed mechanical and interior space significantly increasing rear-seat legroom and luggage room. The second-generation Prius is more environmentally friendly than the previous model (according to the EPA), and is longer than the previous version. Its more aerodynamic Kammback body balances length and wind resistance, resulting in a . The development effort, led by chief engineer Shigeyuki Hori, led to 530 patents for the vehicle.

Production commenced in August 2003 at the Tsutsumi plant in Toyota, Aichi, supplemented in October 2004 with the Fujimatsu plant at Kariya, Aichi.

The Prius uses an all-electric A/C compressor for cooling, an industry first. Combined with a smaller and lighter NiMH battery, the XW20 is more powerful and more efficient than the XW10. In the US, the battery pack of 2004 and later models is warrantied for or 10 years in states that have adopted the stricter California emissions control standards, and or 8 years elsewhere. The warranty for hybrid components is or 8 years.

It is classified as a SULEV (Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle) and is certified by California Air Resources Board as an &quot;Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emission Vehicle&quot; (AT-PZEV). In 2007, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) rated the Prius as among the cleanest vehicles sold in the United States on the basis of smog-forming emissions.

From 2005 to 2009, the second-generation Prius had been built by FAW Toyota in the city of Changchun for the Chinese market. It was reported that a total of 2,152 Priuses were sold in 2006 and 414 in 2007. The relatively low sales were blamed on a high price, about higher than in Japan or the US, caused by high duties on imported parts.
In an attempt to stem the drop in sales, Toyota cut the price of Prius by up to eight percent in March 2008. Toyota sold about 1,192,000-second-generation Priuses worldwide.

== Third generation (XW30; 2009) ==


Toyota debuted the new Prius (2010 US model year) at the January 2009 North American International Auto Show, and sales began in Japan on 18 May 2009. Toyota cut the price of the Prius from to to better compete with the Honda Insight, leading some to wonder whether increased sales of the Prius might come at the expense of sales of other vehicles with higher margins. Competition from lower priced hybrids, such as the Honda Insight, also made it difficult for Toyota to capitalize on the Prius&#x27;s success. , Toyota has sold about 1,688,000 third-generation Priuses worldwide.

Among the new standard features of the Prius, Toyota introduced three user-selectable driving modes: EV mode for electric-only low-speed operation, Eco mode for best fuel efficiency, and Power mode for better performance. Optional features included the solar-PV roof panels to help cool the cabin interior in summer heat, Intelligent Parking Assist, Lane Keep Assist, and Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.

Its new body design features a reduced . This figure was disputed by General Motors which found the value for the model with 17-inch wheels to be around 0.30 based on tests in GM, Ford, and Chrysler wind tunnels. &quot;Car &amp; Driver&quot; measured the third-generation Prius at 0.26 in a privately arranged five-way wind-tunnel test of comparable cars. An underbody rear fin helps stabilize the vehicle at higher speeds.

A new front-drive platform underpinned the car, although the wheelbase remained unchanged and overall length grew by a lone centimetre. Aluminium was employed in the hood, rear hatch, front axle and brake calipers (disc brakes were finally assigned to all four wheels).

The Prius uses a range of plant-derived ecological bioplastics, using wood or grass-derived cellulose instead of petroleum. The two principal crops used are kenaf and ramie. Kenaf is a member of the hibiscus family, a relative to cotton and okra; ramie, commonly known as China grass, is a member of the nettle family and one of the strongest natural fibres, with a density and absorbency comparable to flax. Toyota said this was a timely breakthrough for plant-based eco-plastics because 2009 was the United Nations&#x27; International Year of Natural Fibres, which spotlights kenaf and ramie among others.

===Awards===

At its introduction in 2009, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award for the second time. In December 2013, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; named the Prius as the &quot;Best Value&quot;, for the second year in a row.

A 2019 iSeeCars study ranked the Prius as the second longest-kept vehicle among U.S. drivers.

== Fourth generation (XW50; 2015) ==


The fourth-generation Prius was first shown during September 2015 in Las Vegas, and was released for retail customers in Japan on 9 December 2015. The launch in the North American market occurred in January 2016, and February in Europe &amp; Middle East.

In August 2013, Toyota Managing Officer Satoshi Ogiso, who was chief engineer for the Prius line, announced some of the improvements and key features of the next generation Prius. This was the first generation of the Prius to use the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) modular platform, which provides a lower center of gravity and increased structural rigidity. Ogiso also explained that the next-generation Prius plug-in hybrid, the Prius Prime, was developed in parallel with the standard Prius model.

The 2018 model year Prius Eco ranked as the second-most-fuel-efficient gasoline-powered car without plug-in capability available in the US that year, following the Hyundai Ioniq Blue hybrid.

===2018 facelift===

In late November 2018, for the 2019 model year, the U.S. market Prius lineup introduced an all-wheel drive model featuring Toyota&#x27;s E-Four system. This has been available for the Japanese market Prius since 2015 and the hybrid versions of the RAV4 and Lexus NX. Also, the Prius received a facelift with redesigned headlights and tail lights, which was released in Japan on 17 December 2018.

In 2021, for the 2022 model year, Toyota released the Nightshade Edition in the US. Like other Nightshade models, it added black paint to exterior trim pieces. It was available in FWD or AWD-e powertrain and in three exterior colours.

== Fifth generation (XW60; 2022) ==
The fifth-generation Prius was presented on 16 November 2022, with two powertrain options announced for the Japanese market. The first uses Toyota&#x27;s Series Parallel Hybrid System, available in 1.8-litre (&quot;2ZR-FXE&quot;) and 2.0-litre (&quot;M20A-FXS&quot;) variants and producing up to and respectively. This model is also available with E-Four all-wheel drive system. The second, a plug-in hybrid, combines a 2.0-litre &quot;M20A-FXS&quot; engine, an electric motor and lithium-ion batteries to produce a combined output of .

The new design has a higher but it has a lower frontal area, and a smaller cargo volume than before.

In Europe, deliveries will begin in the first quarter of 2023, with only the plug-in hybrid model being available.

Unlike previous generations, this generation will not be sold in Australia due to sluggish sales with the previous generation. It will be replaced by a shorter Corolla Hatchback Hybrid. Toyota New Zealand also decided not to offer the new generation Prius initially, but have resumed sales in 2024 under their Signature Class imported vehicle program.

In October 2023, Toyota reversed its initial decision not to sell the fifth-generation Prius in the UK.

In 2024, for the 2025 model year, the Prime model was renamed to Plug-in Hybrid for the North American market.

=== Recall ===
In April 2024, Toyota issued a recall affecting 211,000 2023 and 2024 model year Prius and Prius Prime units worldwide where the rear doors can open unexpectedly if not locked due to a short circuit on the electronic rear door latches when the car is moving or involved in a collision. The issue was that water could possibly short circuit the door lock. The issue has now been resolved, remaining vehicles that do not have new switches are replaced at US port of entry for vehicles shipped overseas.

=== Prius Plug-in Hybrid ===

The Prius Plug-in Hybrid (ZVW35) is based on the conventional third generation (ZVW30) with a 4.4kWh lithium-ion battery that allows an all-electric range of . A global demonstration program involving 600 pre-production test cars began in late 2009 and took place in Japan, Europe, Canada, China, Australia, New Zealand and the United States.

The production version was unveiled at the September 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show. Deliveries began in Japan in late January 2012, followed by a limited roll-out in the U.S. in late February. Deliveries began in Europe in June 2012 and in the UK in August 2012.

=== Prius Prime ===

The second generation of the plug-in hybrid version of the Prius, called Toyota Prius Prime in the U.S. and Prius PHV in Japan, was developed in parallel with the standard fourth generation Prius model (XW50) released in December 2015. The model was released to retail customers in the U.S. in November 2016, followed by Japan in February 2017. In the American market, unlike the first generation model, the Prius Prime is available in all 50 states.

=== Prius v ===

At the January 2011 North American International Auto Show, Toyota revealed the 2012 model year Prius &quot;v&quot;, an MPV, which is derived from the third-generation Prius and features over 50 per cent more interior cargo space than the original Prius design.

In May 2011, Toyota introduced the Prius α (alpha) in Japan, which is available in a five-seat, two-row model and a seven-seat, three-row model, the latter&#x27;s third row enabled by a space-saving lithium-ion drive battery in the center console. The five-seat model uses a NiMH battery pack. The Alpha is the basis for the five-seat Prius &quot;v&quot; launched in North America in October 2011 with a nickel-metal hydride battery pack similar to the 2010 model year Prius, and with two rows of seats to accommodate five passengers. The European and Japanese versions are offered with a lithium-ion battery, with three rows of seats with accommodations for seven passengers. The seven passenger seating on the Prius v is not available on North American Prius v models. The European version, named Prius+ (plus), began deliveries in June 2012. US sales ended in 2017. Japanese production ended in March 2021.

=== Prius c ===

Toyota unveiled the Prius c concept at the January 2011 North American International Auto Show. The Prius c has a lower list price and is smaller than the previous Prius liftback. The production version was unveiled at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show as the Toyota Aqua, and was launched in Japan in December 2011. The Prius c was released in the US and Canada in March 2012, and in April 2012 in Australia and New Zealand. The Prius c is not available in Europe, where instead, Toyota is selling the Toyota Yaris Hybrid since June 2012. The Prius c and the Yaris Hybrid share the same powertrain.

== Sales ==
=== Overview ===
Global cumulative Prius liftback sales reached the 1 million vehicle mark in May 2008. Sales of one million were achieved in the U.S. by April 2011, and Japan in August 2011. , the Prius ranked as the world&#x27;s top selling hybrid car with 5 million units sold.

, the Prius is sold in over 90 countries and regions. Worldwide cumulative sales exceeded 2 million units in September 2010, and reached 3 million in June 2013. , global sales of the Prius family totaled almost 6.1 million units representing 61% of the 10 million hybrids delivered by Toyota Motor Company (TMC) worldwide, including the Lexus brand. Sales of the Prius family are led by the Prius liftback, with 4 million units, followed by the Aqua/Prius c with 1.4 million, the Prius +/v/α with, 615 thousand and the Prius Plug-in Hybrid with 79 thousand units.

, the US accounted for almost half of Prius liftback global sales, with 1 million Priuses sold since 2000. The Prius experienced two consecutive years of sales decreases from its peak in 2007, falling to 139,682 units in 2009 before rebounding to 140,928 units in 2010. , sales of the Prius liftback totaled over 1.8 million units in Japan and 1.8 million in the US, and ranked as the all-time best-selling hybrid car in both countries.

; 2010
Cumulative Prius sales in Europe reached 200,000 units by mid-2010, after 10 years in that market. The UK is one of the leading European markets for Prius, accounting for 20% of Priuses sold in Europe. Toyota Prius became Japan&#x27;s best selling vehicle in 2009 for the first time since its debut in 1997 as its sales almost tripled to 208,876 in 2009. In that year it overtook the Honda Fit, which was Japan&#x27;s best-selling car in 2008 excluding Kei cars.

; 2011
Rising oil prices caused by the Arab Spring led to increased sales in Q1 2011, but the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami led to a production stoppage. Production restarted, but output was hindered due to shortages from parts suppliers. Nevertheless, during the 2011 Japanese fiscal year, the Prius family sold 310,484 units, including sales of the Prius α, launched in May 2011, and the Toyota Aqua, launched in December, allowing the Prius brand to become the best-selling vehicle in Japan for the third consecutive year.

; 2012
Until September 2012, the Prius liftback was the top selling new car in Japan for 16 months in a row, until surpassed by the Toyota Aqua in October, which kept the lead through December 2012. The Prius liftback, with 317,675 units sold in 2012, was the best selling car in Japan during 2012 for the fourth consecutive year. The Aqua ranked as the second best selling car with 266,567 units sold in 2012. Nevertheless, when sales of the two Prius models are broken down, the Toyota Aqua ranked as the top selling model in Japan in 2012, including kei cars, leading sales since February through December 2012. The Aqua was the top selling new car in Japan in 2013, and again in 2014. Global Prius sales peaked in 2010 with over 500 thousand units sold, and since 2011 sales of the liftback version have declined in most markets through December 2015, and in the US and Canada since 2013.

High gasoline prices in the US, approaching a gallon by March 2012, contributed to record monthly sales of Prius family vehicles. A total of 28,711 units were sold in the US during March 2012, becoming the one-month record for Prius sales ever. The third-generation Prius liftback accounted for 18,008 units (63%); the Prius v accounted for 4,937 units (17%); the Prius c, for 4,875 units (17%); and the Prius Plug-in Hybrid, for 891 units (3%). Another record was set during the Q1 2012, with Prius family sales of 60,859 units, it became the best selling quarter ever. Sales of Toyota Prius family vehicles in California represented 26% of all Prius purchases in the US during 2012. With 60,688 units sold during this year, the Prius became the best selling vehicle in California, ahead of the Honda Civic (57,124 units) and Toyota Camry (50,250 units). The Prius nameplate was again in 2013 the best selling vehicle in California with 69,728 units sold in the state, ahead of the Honda Civic (66,982) and the Honda Accord (63,194).

Toyota sold 223,905 Priuses among the various HEV family members in the US in 2012, representing together a market share of 51% of all hybrid sold in the country that year. A total of 12,750 Prius PHVs were sold in 2012, allowing the plug-in hybrid to rank as the second top selling plug-in electric car in the US after the Chevrolet Volt, and surpassing the Nissan Leaf. The Toyota Prius liftback, with 147,503 units sold, was the best selling hybrid in 2012, the Prius v ranked third with 40,669 units, and the Prius c was fourth with 35,733 units. Toyota USA estimated that sales of its hybrids models in 2012 would represent 14% of total Toyota sales in the country. Since their inception in 1999, a total of 1.5 million Prius family members have been sold in the US by mid October 2013, representing a 50.1% market share of total hybrid sales in the country. Of these, 1,356,318 are conventional Prius liftbacks sold through September 2013.

Prius family sales also set a record in Japan in March 2012. Accounting for the conventional Prius and Prius α sales, a total of 45,496 units were sold in March 2012, becoming the highest monthly sales ever for any model in Japan since 1997, and representing a market share of 9% of all new car registrations excluding kei cars. The Toyota Aqua sold 29,156 units, ranking as the third top selling car that month. Together, all Prius family vehicles sold 74,652 units, representing 15% of monthly new car sales in March 2012. With a total of 247,230 vehicles sold during the first quarter of 2012, the Toyota Prius family became the third top selling nameplate in the world in terms of total global sales, after the Toyota Corolla (300,800 units) and the Ford Focus (277,000 units).

; Since 2012
US Prius sales have declined every year since their peak in 2012, due to competition from other manufacturers.

=== Liftback sales ===

=== Sales of non-liftback ===
The following table presents retail sales of the other vehicles of the Prius family by year since deliveries began in 2011 through December 2016.

== Design and technology ==

The Prius is a power-split or series-parallel (full) hybrid, sometimes referred to as a combined hybrid, a vehicle that can be propelled by gasoline or electric power or both. Wind resistance is reduced by a (0.29 for 2000 model) with a Kammback design to reduce air resistance. Lower rolling-resistance tires are used to reduce road friction. An electric water pump eliminates serpentine belts. In the US and Canada, a vacuum flask is used to store hot coolant when the vehicle is powered off for reuse so as to reduce warm-up time. The Prius engine makes use of the Atkinson cycle.

=== EV mode ===
When the vehicle is turned on with the &quot;Power&quot; button, it is ready to drive immediately with the electric motor. In the North American second generation Prius, electric pumps warm the engine by pumping previously saved hot engine coolant from a coolant thermos before the internal combustion engine is started. The delay between powering the car on and starting the internal combustion engine is a few seconds. The third generation Prius does not have a coolant thermos. Instead, the engine is heated by recapturing exhaust heat. A button labelled &quot;EV&quot; maintains Electric Vehicle mode after being powered on and under most low-load conditions at less than . This permits driving with low noise and no fuel consumption for journeys under , Longer journeys are possible as long as the speed is kept below , acceleration is kept low and the battery has enough charge. The engine starts automatically when the battery starts to run low. Prior to the 2010 model, the North American model did not have the &quot;EV&quot; button, although one can be added to enable the &quot;EV&quot; mode supported internally by the Prius Hybrid Vehicle management computer. For the North American market, the third generation can remain in EV mode until depending on throttle and road gradient.

=== Batteries ===
There are two batteries: the high voltage (HV) battery pack, also known as the traction battery, and a 12-volt battery known as the low voltage (LV) battery. The traction battery of the first generation Prius update (2000 onwards) was a sealed 38-module nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery pack with a capacity of 1.78kWh at a voltage of 273.6V, and weighing and is supplied by Japan&#x27;s Panasonic EV Energy Co. They are normally charged between 40 and 60% of maximum capacity to prolong battery life as well as allow headroom for regenerative braking. Each battery pack uses of lanthanum, and each Prius electric motor contains of neodymium; production of the car has been described as &quot;the biggest user of rare earths of any object in the world.&quot; The LV battery provides power to the computer and various accessories such as wiper motors, headlights etc.

The Second Generation Prius contains a 1.310kWh battery, composed of 28 modules. Each battery module is made of six individual 1.2V 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells in series forming a 7.2V 6.5Ah module with 46Wh/kg energy density and 1.3kW/kg output power density. Each module contains an integrated charge controller and relay. These modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6V 6.5Ah battery (traction battery), also known as the energy storage system. The computer-controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38% and 82% state of charge, with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60%. By shallow cycling the battery, only a small portion of its net available energy storage capacity is available for use (approximately 400Wh) by the hybrid drive system, but the shallow computer-controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life, thermal management control, and net long term calendar life of the battery. Active cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and air ducting, while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design.

=== Battery life cycle ===
As the Prius reached ten years of being available in the US market, in February 2011 &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; examined the lifetime and replacement cost of the Prius battery. The magazine tested a 2002 Toyota Prius with over on it and compared the results to the nearly identical 2001 Prius with tested by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; 10 years before. The comparison showed little difference in performance when tested for fuel economy and acceleration. Overall fuel economy of the 2001 model was while the 2002 Prius with high mileage delivered . The magazine concluded that the effectiveness of the battery has not degraded over the long run. The cost of replacing the first generation battery varies between and from a Toyota dealer, but low-use units from salvage yards are available for around . One study indicates it may be worthwhile to rebuild batteries using good blades from defective used batteries.

=== Air conditioning (HVAC) ===
The HVAC system uses an AC induction motor to drive a sealed-system scroll compressor, a design principle not usually used in automotive applications. Using a scroll compressor increases the efficiency of the system while driving it with an AC induction motor makes the system more flexible, so the AC can run while the engine is off. Because the oil used with the refrigerant gas also flows in the area of the high-voltage motor-windings, the fluid must be electrically insulating to avoid transmitting electric current to exposed metal parts of the system. Therefore, Toyota specifies that a polyolester (POE) oil (designated ND11) is required for repairs. The system cannot be serviced with equipment normally employed for regular cars, which typically use polyalkylene glycol (PAG) oil, as the equipment would contaminate the ND11 oil with PAG oil. According to SAE J2843, the oil provided from maintenance equipment must contain less than 0.1% PAG when filling. One percent PAG oil may result in an electrical resistance drop by a factor of about 10.

== Environmental impact ==
=== Fuel economy and emissions ===
; United States

Since its introduction, the Toyota Prius has been among the best fuel economy vehicles available in the United States, and for the model year 2012, the Prius family has three models among the 10 most fuel-efficient cars sold in the country as rated by US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). After the Honda Insight first generation was discontinued in September 2006, the Prius liftback became the most fuel-efficient car sold in the American market, until it was topped by the Chevrolet Volt in December 2010, as the plug-in hybrid was rated by EPA with an overall combined city/highway gasoline-electricity fuel economy of . According to the EPA, for the model year 2012, and when only gasoline-powered vehicles are considered (excluding all-electric cars), the Prius c ranks as the most fuel-efficient compact car, the Prius liftback as the most fuel-efficient mid-size car, and the Prius v as the most fuel-efficient mid-size station wagon.

More fossil fuel is needed to build hybrid vehicles than conventional cars but reduced emissions when running the vehicle more than outweigh this.


; Japan
The following table presents fuel economy performance and carbon emissions for all Prius family models sold in Japan since 1997. The ratings are presented for both, the older official 10-15 mode cycle test and the new JC08 test designed for Japan&#x27;s new standards that went into effect in 2015, but was already being used by several car manufacturers for new cars. The Prius 2nd generation became the first car to meet Japan&#x27;s new 2015 Fuel Economy Standards measured under the JC08 test.


=== Lifetime energy usage ===
In 2008, the British government and British media requested that Toyota release detailed figures for the energy use and emissions resulting from the building and disposal of the Prius. Toyota has not supplied the requested data to address statements that the lifetime energy usage of the Prius (including the increased environmental cost of manufacture and disposal of the nickel-metal hydride battery) is outweighed by lower lifetime fuel consumption. Toyota states that lifetime saving is 43 percent. , the UK Government Car Service operated over 100 Priuses (the largest part of its fleet) and lists the Prius as having the lowest emissions among its fleet.

CNW Marketing Research initially published a study in which they estimated that the total lifetime energy cost of a 2005 Prius was greater than that of a Hummer H2. The study has been widely debunked: see for example, &quot;Hummer versus Prius: &#x27;Dust to Dust&#x27; Report Misleads the Media and Public with Bad Science&quot;.

=== Electromagnetic field levels ===

The Prius uses electric motors in the hybrid propulsion systems, powered by a high voltage battery in the rear of the car. There has been some public concern over whether the levels of electromagnetic field exposure within the cabin are higher than comparable cars, and what health effects those fields may present, popularized by a 2008 &quot;The New York Times&quot; article. Toyota and several independent studies&lt;ref name=&quot;Radiation Protection Dosimetry doi: 10.1093/rpd/ncq168&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; have indicated that aside from a brief spike when accelerating, the electromagnetic fields within the Prius are no different from those of a conventional car and do not exceed the ICNIRP exposure guidelines.
A 2013 study by the Mayo Clinic found that patients with implanted cardiac devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators can safely drive or ride in hybrids or plug-in electric cars without risk of electromagnetic interference (EMI). The research was conducted using implantable devices from the three major manufacturers and a 2012 Toyota Prius hybrid. The study used 30 participants with implanted devices and measured electric and magnetic fields in six positions inside and outside the Prius, and each position was evaluated at different speeds.

=== Quietness ===
&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported in February 2007 on concerns that quiet cars like the Prius may pose a safety risk to pedestrians who rely on engine noise to sense the presence or location of moving vehicles. Blind pedestrians are a primary concern, and the National Federation of the Blind advocates audio emitters on hybrid vehicles, but it has been argued that increased risks may also affect sighted pedestrians or bicyclists who are accustomed to aural cues from vehicles. However, silent vehicles are already relatively common, and there is also a lack of aural cues from vehicles that have a conventional internal combustion engine where engine noise has been reduced by noise-absorbing materials in the engine bay and noise-cancelling muffler systems. In July 2007, a spokesman for Toyota said the company is aware of the issue and is studying options.

In 2010, Toyota released a device for the third-generation Prius meant to alert pedestrians of its proximity. Japan issued guidelines for such warning devices in January 2010 and the US approved legislation in December 2010. Models equipped with automatically activated systems include all 2012 and later model year Prius family vehicles that have been introduced in the United States, including the standard Prius, the Prius v, the Prius c and the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid. The warning sound is activated when the car is traveling at less than and cannot be manually turned off.

== Marketing and culture ==
=== advertising ===
In the UK, the Advertising Standards Authority, an independent body charged with policing the rules of the advertising industry, ruled that a television advert for the Toyota Prius should not be broadcast again in the same form, having breached rules concerning misleading advertising. The advertisement stated that the Prius &quot;emits up to one tonne less per year&quot;, while on-screen text included &quot;1 tonne of less than an equivalent family vehicle with a diesel engine. Average calculated on 20,000km a year.&quot; Points of contention were the vehicles chosen for comparison, whether &quot;″up to&#x27; one tonne less&quot; adequately communicated that reductions could be lower, and whether the distance used was appropriate: per year is around a US car&#x27;s average annual driving distance, while a UK car&#x27;s is .

=== Political symbolism ===
The large number of Prius-owning progressive celebrities in 2002 prompted &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to dub hybrids &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s latest politically correct status symbol&quot;. Conservatives called &quot;Prius Patriots&quot; also drive the cars because they want to contribute to reducing US dependence on foreign oil. A 2007 &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; article said &quot;Prius Progressives&quot; were becoming an archetype, with American conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh opining that &quot;these liberals think they&#x27;re ahead of the game on these things, and they&#x27;re just suckers&quot;.

In July 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article using data from CNW Marketing Research finding that 57% of Prius buyers said their main reason for buying was that &quot;it makes a statement about me&quot;, while just 37% cited fuel economy as a prime motivator. Shortly afterwards &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Robert Samuelson coined the term &quot;Prius politics&quot; to describe a situation where the driver&#x27;s desire to &quot;show off&quot; is a stronger motivator than the desire to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Some conservatives promote the use of the Toyota Prius and other hybrid cars. For example, Jim Road from &quot;What Would Jesus Drive?&quot; encouraged people to drive hybrid cars because of the damage that large SUVs and faster cars can do to others.

Former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) chief R. James Woolsey, Jr. drives a Prius because of its low fuel consumption. Woolsey noted the volatility of the Middle East, coupled with anti-US sentiment in much of the region. Noting that the high percentage of oil drilled in the Middle East gives vast profits to Middle Eastern regimes, Woolsey believes that it is a patriotic obligation to drive more efficient vehicles. In a &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine article, Woolsey stated that those oil profits find their way to terrorist groups like al-Qaeda, meaning that Americans who buy inefficient vehicles would, in effect, be indirectly funding terrorism. &quot;We&#x27;re paying for both sides in this war, and that&#x27;s not a good long-term strategy,&quot; said Woolsey. &quot;I have a bumper sticker on the back of my Prius that reads, &#x27;Bin Laden hates this car.&#x27;&quot;

=== DARPA driverless edition ===
A driverless version of the Prius was one of six cars to finish the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge.

== Motorsports ==
A racing version of the Prius was unveiled by Toyota in 2013. This racing Prius replaces the 1.8-litre Atkinson-cycle engine with a 3.4-litre V8 RV8KLM engine which is mid-mounted in the car. The hybrid drivetrain of the car&#x27;s production Hybrid Synergy Drive is retained but with a larger lithium-ion battery. The RV8KLM is in fact the same engine featured in multiple Le Mans Prototypes such as the Lola B12/60 and Rebellion R-One. The car took class pole position and finished sixth at the 2012 Fuji GT 500km.

For 2019 a new version of the Prius was unveiled. Based on the Prius PHV GR Sport, this version of the Prius was powered by a 5.4L 2UR-GSE V8 mounted in the front of the car. The hybrid system was retained for this version of the car but only on the #31 car. The Prius was retired from Super GT competition after the 2022 Super GT Series.

== Government and corporate incentives ==

There have been a number of governments with incentives intended to encourage hybrid car sales. In some countries, including the US and Canada, some rebate incentives have been exhausted, while other countries such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, Belgium, and the Netherlands have various or alternative incentives to purchasing a hybrid vehicle.

Several US companies offer employees incentives. Bank of America will reimburse on the purchase of new hybrid vehicles to full- and part-time associates working more than 20 hours per week. Google, software company Hyperion Solutions, and organic food and drink producer Clif Bar &amp; Co offer employees a credit toward their purchase of certain hybrid vehicles including the Prius. Integrated Archive Systems, a Palo Alto IT company, offers a subsidy toward the purchase of hybrid vehicles to full-time employees employed more than one year.

Travelers Companies, a large insurance company, offers hybrid owners a 10% discount on auto insurance in most US states. The Farmers Insurance Group offers a similar discount of up to 10% in most US states.

In June 2015, the Prius started use as a general purpose patrol car of the National Police of Ukraine. In return for Ukrainian emissions permits under the Kyoto Protocol, 1,568 cars were supplied by Japan.

The Philippine National Police is one of the agency beneficiaries of the Toyota Prius (2017 model) hybrid cars donated by the Department of Energy (DOE) through the Japan’s Non-Project Grant Aid (NPGA) as part of the DOE’s campaign to promote energy efficiency and clean air across the country. Forty-five units of the vehicle will be given to Police Regional Office 8 particularly the areas which were affected by Typhoon Yolanda in 2013 to support the socio-economic recovery of the communities and provide additional police mobility. The official turnover of donation led by Ambassador Kazuhide Ishikawa, Embassy of Japan to the Philippines, and Department of Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi was held on 19 May 2017 at the DOE Sunken Garden in Taguig where representatives of the agency beneficiaries received the key replicas.

<doc id="346664" wikidata="Q315637" url="?curid=346664" title="Gustavo Díaz Ordaz">
<text>Gustavo Díaz Ordaz Bolaños (; 12 March 1911 – 15 July 1979) was a Mexican politician and member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He served as the President of Mexico from 1964 to 1970. Previously, he served as a member of the Chamber of Deputies for Puebla&#x27;s 1st district, a senator of the Congress of the Union for Puebla, and Secretary of the Interior.

Díaz Ordaz was born in San Andrés Chalchicomula, and obtained a law degree from the University of Puebla in 1937 where he later became its vice-rector. He represented Puebla&#x27;s 1st district in the Chamber of Deputies from 1943 to 1946. Subsequently, he represented the same state in the Chamber of Senators from 1946 to 1952 becoming closely acquainted with then-senator Adolfo López Mateos. Díaz Ordaz was a CIA asset, known by the cryptonym, LITEMPO-2.

Díaz Ordaz joined the campaign of Adolfo Ruiz Cortines for the 1952 election and subsequently worked for the Secretariat of the Interior under Ángel Carvajal Bernal. He became the secretary following López Mateos&#x27; victory in the 1958 election, and exercised &quot;de facto&quot; executive power during the absences of the president, particularly during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1963, the PRI announced him as the presidential candidate for the 1964 election, he received 88.81% of the popular vote.

His administration is mostly remembered for the student protests that took place in 1968, and their subsequent repression by the Army and State forces during the Tlatelolco massacre, in which hundreds of unarmed protesters were killed. His presidency also took place during a period of high economic growth known as the Mexican Miracle.

After passing on presidency to his own Secretary of the Interior (Luis Echeverría), Díaz Ordaz retired from public life. He was briefly the Ambassador to Spain in 1977, a position he resigned after strong protests and criticism by the media. He died of colorectal cancer on 15 July 1979 at the age of 68.

Despite high economic growth during his presidency, Díaz Ordaz is considered one of the most unpopular and controversial modern Mexican presidents, largely for the Tlatelolco massacre and other repressive acts, which would continue into the presidencies of his successors.

==Early life and education==
Gustavo Díaz Ordaz Bolaños was born on 12 March 1911 in San Andrés Chalchicomula (now Ciudad Serdán), Puebla. His family was of mixed Spanish and Indigenous ancestry. He had two older siblings, Ramón (born 1905) and María (born 1908), and two younger siblings, Ernesto and Guadalupe. In his later years his father, Ramón Díaz Ordaz Redonet, worked as an accountant. However, for a decade he served in the political machine of President Porfirio Díaz, becoming the &quot;jefe político&quot; and police administrator of San Andrés Chilchicomula. When Díaz was ousted by revolutionary forces in May 1911 at the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, he lost his bureaucratic post in the regime change. Subsequently, the family&#x27;s financial situation was insecure, and Díaz Ordaz&#x27;s father took a number of jobs and the family frequently moved. He claimed ancestry with conqueror-chronicler Bernal Díaz del Castillo. Gustavo&#x27;s mother, Sabina Bolaños Cacho de Díaz Ordaz, was a school teacher, described as &quot;stern and pious&quot;. Gustavo, as well as his elder brother Rámon, had a weak chin and large protruding teeth and was skinny. &quot;His mother would freely say to anyone, &#x27;But what an ugly son I have!&#x27;&quot; His lack of good looks became a way to mock him when he became president of Mexico.

The comedian Chespirito (real name Roberto Gómez Bolaños) was his first cousin once removed.

When the family lived for a time in Oaxaca, the young Díaz Ordaz attended the Institute of Arts and Sciences, whose alumni included Benito Juárez and Porfirio Díaz. He was a serious student, but due to his family&#x27;s financial circumstances, he could not always buy the textbooks he needed. At one point, the family lived as a charity case with a maternal uncle in Oaxaca, who was a Oaxaca state official. The family had to absent themselves when powerful visitors came to the residence. While Gustavo attended the institute, his elder brother Ramón taught there after studies in Spain, teaching Latin. A student mocked Professor Ramón Díaz Ordaz&#x27;s ugliness, and Gustavo defended his brother with physical force. Díaz Ordaz graduated from the University of Puebla on 8 February 1937 with a law degree. He became a professor at the university and served as vice-rector from 1940 to 1941.

== Early political career ==

His political career had a modest start. He had not fought in the Revolution and his father had been part of Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s regime, so his political rise was not straightforward. He served in the government of Puebla from 1932 to 1943. In the latter year he became a federal politician, serving in the Chamber of Deputies for the first district of the state of Puebla, and he served as a senator for the same state from 1946 to 1952. He came to national prominence in the cabinet of Mexican President President Adolfo López Mateos from 1958 to 1964, as Minister of the Interior (&quot;Gobernación&quot;). On 18 November 1963, he became the presidential candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Despite facing only token opposition, Díaz Ordaz campaigned as if he were the underdog. He won the presidential election on 5 July 1964, with 88.8% of the popular vote, while his main opponent, José González Torres of the National Action Party garnered only 10.9%.

== Presidency ==
===Inauguration===

Díaz Ordaz assumed the presidency on 1 December 1964 at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. There, he took the oath before the Congress of the Union presided over by Alfonso Martínez Domínguez. Former president Adolfo López Mateos turned over the presidential sash, and Díaz Ordaz delivered his inaugural address. The address lasted almost an hour, which was long for an inauguration speech in Mexico at the time. In his address, he promised to defend Mexico&#x27;s constitution, submit to the will of Mexico&#x27;s people, to prioritize the needs of Mexico&#x27;s farmers, and (in response to criticism of the government&#x27;s heavy involvement in business) that the government would not compete or supplant private investment. On foreign policy, he stated that Mexico would not break off relations with Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba, and that foreign investment was always welcome in Mexico as long as laws were followed. He announced the members of his cabinet, retaining four ministers from López Mateos. Also at the inauguration were former presidents Emilio Portes Gil, Abelardo L. Rodríguez, Lázaro Cárdenas, Miguel Alemán Valdés, and Adolfo Ruiz Cortines.

=== Domestic policy ===
As president, Díaz Ordaz was known for his authoritarian manner of rule over his cabinet and the country in general. His strictness was evident in his handling of a number of protests during his term, in which railroad workers, teachers, and doctors were fired for taking industrial action. A first demonstration of this new authoritarianism was given when he used force to end a strike by medics. Medics of the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers, especially residents and interns, had organized a strike to demand better working conditions and an increased salary. 
His authoritarian style of governing produced resistance such as the emergence of a guerrilla movement in the state of Guerrero. Economically, the era of Díaz Ordaz was a time of growth. He established the Mexican Institute of Petroleum in 1965, an important step, for oil has been one of Mexico&#x27;s most productive industries.

==== Student movement ====

When university students in Mexico City protested the government&#x27;s actions around the time of the 1968 Summer Olympics, Díaz Ordaz oversaw the occupation of the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the arrest of several students, leading to the shooting of hundreds of unarmed protesters during the Tlatelolco massacre in Downtown Mexico City on 2 October 1968. The Mexican army fired ruthlessly because a group called &quot;Battalion Olympia&quot; started the shooting between the unarmed students and many other people who let the students take shelter inside their homes. Statistics concerning the casualties of this incident vary, often for political reasons. Some people were kept imprisoned for several years. The crackdown would eventually be denounced by Díaz Ordaz&#x27;s successors, and ordinary Mexicans view the assault on unarmed students as an atrocity. The stain would remain on the PRI for many years.

Every year, on the anniversary of the Tlatelolco massacre, the statue of Díaz Ordaz in Zapopan, Jalisco, is vandalized by having a bucket of red paint splattered on it.

==== Attempt to democratize the PRI ====
Díaz Ordaz&#x27;s authoritarian manner of rule also prevented any attempt to democratize the PRI. The president of the PRI, Carlos Madrazo, made such an attempt by proposing inner-party elections in order to strengthen the party&#x27;s base. After his attempt failed, Madrazo resigned.

=== Foreign policy ===

==== United States ====

During the administration of Díaz Ordaz, relations with the US were largely harmonic, and several bilateral treaties were formed. On September 8, 1969, Díaz Ordaz and President Richard Nixon inaugurated the Amistad Dam in Texas. In Díaz Ordaz&#x27;s honor, President Nixon hosted the first White House state dinner to be held outside Washington, D.C., at San Diego&#x27;s Hotel del Coronado on 3 September 1970.
However, there also were some points of conflict with the US. One was the antidrug Operation Intercept, conducted by the U.S.; between September and October 1969, all vehicles entering the US from Mexico were inspected. Mexico also embraced the doctrine of nonintervention, and Díaz Ordaz condemned the US invasion of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic.

==== Treaty of Tlatelolco ====
Under his administration, the Treaty of Tlatelolco prohibited the production, possession, or use of nuclear weapons in Latin America. Only peaceful use of nuclear energy was allowed. The treaty made Latin America a nuclear weapon-free zone.

=== Presidential succession===

On 12 October 1969, Díaz Ordaz chose his Secretary of the Interior, Luis Echeverría, as his successor, the seventh successive such selection by a sitting president without incident. Other possible candidates were Alfonso Corona de Rosal, Emilio Martínez Manatou, and Antonio Ortiz Mena. He also considered Antonio Rocha Cordero, governor of the state of San Luis Potosí and former Attorney General, who was eliminated owing to his age (58), and Jesús Reyes Heroles, who was disqualified because a parent had been born outside Mexico, in this case Spain, which was prohibited by Article 82 of the Constitution. In the assessment of political scientist Jorge G. Castañeda, Echeverría was Díaz Ordaz&#x27;s pick by elimination, not choice.

== Later life ==
After his term expired, Díaz Ordaz and his family vanished completely from the public eye; he was occasionally mentioned in newspapers (usually in a derogatory manner), he seldom gave interviews, and he was usually spotted only when voting in elections.

In 1977, a break from that obscurity came as he was appointed as the first Mexican Ambassador to Spain in 38 years, relations between the two countries having previously been broken by the triumph of Falangism in the Spanish Civil War. During his brief stint as Ambassador, he met with hostility from both the Spanish media and the Mexican media, as he was persistently asked questions about his actions as president. He resigned within several months because of that and his health problems. Popular discontent led to a catchphrase: &quot;Al pueblo de España no le manden esa araña&quot; (&quot;To the people of Spain, do not send that spider&quot;).

Díaz Ordaz became a critic of Luis Echeverría&#x27;s presidency, particularly his use of populist policies. Díaz Ordaz once referred to Echeverría as someone who was, &quot;out of control. [Echeverría] talks about anything. He doesn&#x27;t know what he is saying. He insists he&#x27;s going to make changes, but he doesn&#x27;t say to what end.&quot;

== Death ==
He died on July 15, 1979, aged 68 of colorectal cancer, at home in his bed in Mexico City, with his physician and children Gustavo, Guadalupe, and Ramón all present. His remains were buried at Panteón Jardín, with those of his wife.

==Legacy and public opinion==

Licenciado Gustavo Díaz Ordaz International Airport in Puerto Vallarta is named after him.

Public opinion on the Díaz Ordaz administration and its legacy continues to be mostly negative, being associated with the Tlatelolco massacre and a general hardening of authoritarianism that would prevail during successive PRI administrations. Even during his lifetime, his appointment as Ambassador to Spain in 1977 was met with such rejection and protests that he had to resign shortly after.

In a national survey conducted in 2012, 27% of the respondents considered that the Díaz Ordaz administration was &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, 20% responded that it was an &quot;average&quot; administration, and 45% responded that it was a &quot;very bad&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; administration.

In 2018, the Government of Mexico City retired all plaques from the Mexico City Subway system making reference to Díaz Ordaz that were installed during his administration.

<text>On December 22, 2001, a failed shoe bombing attempt occurred aboard American Airlines Flight 63. The aircraft, a Boeing 767-300ER (registration N384AA) with 197 passengers and crew aboard, was flying from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France, to Miami International Airport in the U.S. state of Florida.

The perpetrator, Richard Reid, was subdued by passengers after unsuccessfully attempting to detonate plastic explosives concealed within his shoes. The flight was diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston, escorted by American jet fighters, and landed without further incident. Reid was arrested and eventually sentenced to three life terms plus 110 years, without parole.

==Incident==
As Flight 63 was flying over the Atlantic Ocean, Richard Reid, an Islamic fundamentalist from the United Kingdom and self-proclaimed al-Qaeda operative, carried shoes that were packed with two types of explosives. He had been refused permission to board the flight the day before.

Passengers on the flight complained of a smoky smell shortly after the meal service. One flight attendant, Hermis Moutardier, walked the aisles of the plane to locate the source. She found Reid sitting alone near a window, attempting to light a match. Moutardier warned him that smoking was not allowed on board the aircraft, and Reid promised to stop.

A few minutes later, Moutardier found Reid leaning over in his seat and unsuccessfully attempted to get his attention. After she asked him what he was doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match. He was unable to detonate the bomb: perspiration from his feet dampened the triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and prevented it from igniting.

Moutardier tried grabbing Reid twice, but he pushed her to the floor each time, and she screamed for help. When another flight attendant, Cristina Jones, arrived to try to subdue Reid, he fought her and bit her thumb.

The Reid, who weighed , was subdued by the flight attendants and other passengers and immobilized by the cabin crew using plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions, and headphone cords. A doctor administered diazepam found in the flight kit of the aircraft. Many of the passengers only became aware of the situation when the pilot announced that the flight was to be diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston.

Two F-15 fighter jets escorted Flight 63 to Logan Airport. The plane parked in the middle of the runway, and Reid was arrested on the ground while the rest of the passengers were bussed to the main terminal. Authorities later found over of TATP and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) hidden in the hollowed soles of Reid&#x27;s shoes, which, if detonated, would have blown a significant hole in the aircraft and likely caused it to crash. He pleaded guilty, and he was convicted, sentenced to three life terms plus 110 years without parole and incarcerated at ADX Florence, a supermax federal prison in Colorado.

== Aftermath ==
Six months after the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in Queens, New York, on November 12, 2001, Mohammed Mansour Jabarah agreed to cooperate with American authorities in exchange for a reduced sentence. He said that fellow Canadian Abderraouf Jdey had been responsible for the flight&#x27;s destruction, using a shoe bomb similar to that found on Reid several months earlier. However, it was revealed during the crash investigation that pilot error, not terrorism, brought down the plane. Jabarah was a known colleague of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and said that Reid and Jdey had both been enlisted by the al-Qaeda chief to participate in identical plots.

In 2006, security procedures at American airports were changed in response to this incident, with passengers required to remove their shoes before proceeding through scanners. The requirement was phased out for some travelers, particularly those with TSA PreCheck, in 2011. Also in 2011, the rules were relaxed to allow children 12 and younger and adults 75 and older to keep their shoes on during security screenings.

<doc id="346669" wikidata="Q1268205" url="?curid=346669" title="Eastern whip-poor-will">
<text>The eastern whip-poor-will (Antrostomus vociferus; also called &quot;whip-o-will&quot;, &quot;whip o&#x27; will&quot;, etc.) is a medium-sized () bird within the nightjar family, Caprimulgidae, from North America. The whip-poor-will is commonly heard within its range, but less often seen because of its camouflage. It is named onomatopoeically after its song.

==Description==

This medium-sized nightjar measures in length, spans across the wings and weighs . Further standard measurements are a wing chord of , a tail of , a bill of and a tarsus of . Adults have mottled plumage: the upperparts are grey, black and brown; the lower parts are grey and black. They have a very short bill and a black throat. Males have a white patch below the throat and white tips on the outer tail feathers; in the female, these parts are light brown.

This bird is sometimes confused with the related chuck-will&#x27;s-widow (&quot;Antrostomus carolinensis&quot;) which has a similar but lower-pitched and slower call.

==Ecology==
Eastern whip-poor-wills breed in deciduous or mixed woods across central and southeastern Canada and the eastern United States, and migrate to the southeastern United States and to eastern Mexico and Central America for the winter. These birds forage at night, catching insects in flight, and normally sleep during the day. Eastern whip-poor-wills nest on the ground, in shaded locations among dead leaves, and usually lay two eggs at a time. The bird will commonly remain on the nest unless almost stepped upon.

The whip-poor-will has been split into two species. Eastern populations are now referred to as the eastern whip-poor-will. The disjunct population in southwestern United States and Mexico is now referred to as the Mexican whip-poor-will, &quot;Antrostomus arizonae&quot;. The two populations were split based on range, different vocalizations, different egg coloration, and DNA sequencing showing differentiation.

== Diet ==
The diet of an Eastern whip-poor-will mostly consists of insects, especially moths, also beetles, mosquitoes, and many others.

== Conservation ==

The eastern whip-poor-will is currently in decline, though they remain fairly common. In 2017, the eastern whip-poor-will was uplisted from least concern to near threatened on the IUCN Red List on the basis of citizen science observations demonstrating a decline in populations of the eastern whip-poor-will by over 60% between 1970 and 2014. Several reasons for the decline are proposed, such as loss of early successional forest habitat related to fire suppression and habitat destruction, predation by feral cats and dogs, and poisoning by insecticides, but the actual causes remain elusive. Pesticides and intensified agriculture have led to declines in the flying insect populations that the eastern whip-poor-will depends on. BirdLife International has stated that initiatives like the Conservation Reserve Program will be crucial in conserving the species and reversing its decline.

==Cultural references==

Due to its song, the eastern whip-poor-will is the topic of numerous legends. A New England legend says the whip-poor-will can sense a soul departing, and can capture it as it flees. This is used as a plot device in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s story &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;. Lovecraft based this idea on information of local legends given to him by Edith Miniter of North Wilbraham, Massachusetts, when he visited her in 1928. This is likely related to an earlier Native American and general American folk belief that the singing of the birds is a death omen. This is also referred by &quot;Whip-poor-will&quot;, a short story by James Thurber, in which the constant nighttime singing of a whip-poor-will results in maddening insomnia of the protagonist, Mr. Kinstrey, who eventually loses his mind and kills everyone in his house, including himself. The bird also features in &quot;The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim&#x27;s Point&quot;, a poem by the English poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, in which the outcast speaker asks: &quot;Could the whip-poor-will or the cat of the glen/Look into my eyes and be bold?&quot;

It is also frequently used as an auditory symbol of rural America, as in Washington Irving&#x27;s story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;, or as a plot device. For example, William Faulkner&#x27;s short story, &quot;Barn Burning&quot;, makes several mentions of whip-poor-wills: &quot;and then he found that he had been asleep because he knew it was almost dawn, the night almost over. He could tell that from the whip-poor-wills. They were everywhere now among the dark trees below him, constant and inflectioned and ceaseless, so that, as the instant for giving over to the day birds drew nearer and nearer, there was no interval at all between them.&quot;

&quot;The Mountain Whippoorwill&quot; is a poem written by Stephen Vincent Benét about a fiddling contest, won by Hillbilly Jim, who refers to his fiddle as a whip-poor-will and identifies the bird with the lonely and poor but vibrant life of the mountain people. American poet Robert Frost described the sound of a whip-poor-will in the fourth stanza of his 1915 poem &quot;Ghost House&quot;. This is notable in Frost&#x27;s use of assonance in &quot;The whippoorwill is coming to shout / And hush and cluck and flutter about&quot;.

Emily Dickinson wrote &quot;Many a phrase has the English language - / I have heard but one - / Low as the laughter of the Cricket, / Loud, as the Thunder&#x27;s Tongue - / Murmuring, like old Caspian Choirs, / When the Tide&#x27;s a&#x27;lull - / Saying itself in new inflection - / Like a Whippowil -&quot;

The chorus of George A. Whiting and Walter Donaldson&#x27;s song &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; (1927) begins, &quot;When Whip-poor-wills call and ev&#x27;ning is nigh&quot;.

In the 1934 Frank Capra film &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, before Clark Gable&#x27;s character Peter Warne reveals his name to Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), he famously says to her, &quot;I am the whip-poor-will that cries in the night&quot;.

Hank Williams&#x27;s 1949 song &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot; refers to the whip-poor-will&#x27;s sound in its opening line: &quot;Hear that lonesome whippoorwill, he sounds too blue to fly&quot;. The chorus of Alan Jackson&#x27;s 1992 single Midnight in Montgomery makes reference to this lyric: &quot;Just hear that whippoorwill&quot;.

In the 1958 movie &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, Keely Smith sings &quot;The Whippoorwill,&quot; a song written by Robert Mitchum and Don Raye.

Elton John and Bernie Taupin&#x27;s 1975 song &quot;Philadelphia Freedom&quot; features a flute mimicking the call of the eastern whip-poor-will and includes the lyrics &quot;I like living easy without family ties, till the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me right between the eyes.&quot;

The Pennsylvania-based Indie rock band Dr Dog released their song &quot;Lonesome&quot; on their 2012 album &quot;Be the Void&quot;, featuring the passage &quot;I had my fill of the Whippoorwill / When he broke into song I shot him&quot;.

The song, &quot;Cockeyed Optimist&quot;, sung by Nellie Forbush in Rodger&#x27;s and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;South Pacific&quot;, mentions such bird, singing, &quot;But every whip-poor-will / Is selling me a bill/ And telling me it just ain&#x27;t so!&quot;

In the novel &quot;Slapstick&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut, the narrator hears the call of a whip-poor-will, which the narrator referred to as a child as &quot;The Nocturnal Goatsucker&quot;.

In the fifth episode of the Netflix animated series &quot;The Midnight Gospel&quot;, titled &quot;Annihilation of Joy&quot;, the protagonist encounters a talking bird attached to a prisoner. The bird, voiced by Jason Louv, introduces itself as a &quot;psychopomp or a whippoorwill&quot; and explains the cycle of death and rebirth experienced by its charge, a prisoner caught in an &quot;existential trap&quot;.

The whip-poor-will is also featured in the last line of the chorus of the song &quot;Deeper Than the Holler&quot;, a song written by Paul Overstreet and Don Schlitz, and recorded by American country music singer Randy Travis, where the singer&#x27;s love is stated to be &quot;longer than the song of a whippoorwill&quot;.

The second verse of the song, &quot;My Home Among the Hills&quot;, about the state of West Virginia contains the lyrics &quot;Where the moonlit meadows ring with the call of whippoorwills&quot;.

<doc id="346677" wikidata="Q19027" url="?curid=346677" title="Black-billed cuckoo">
<text>The black-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus erythropthalmus) is a New World species in the Cuculidae (cuckoo) family. The scientific name is from Ancient Greek. The genus name, &quot;kokkuzo&quot;, means to call like a common cuckoo, and &quot;erythropthalmus&quot; is from &quot;eruthros&quot;, &quot;red&quot; and &quot;ophthalmos&quot;, &quot;eye&quot;.

It is very similar and overlaps in range with the closely related yellow-billed cuckoo. A distinguishing characteristic of the family Cuculidae is laying eggs in the nests of other birds. Although many cuckoos are obligate brood parasites, &quot;C. erythropthalmus&quot; often incubate their own chicks.

==Description==

Adults have a long, graduated brown tail and a black, slightly downcurved bill. The head and upper parts are brown and the underparts are white. The feet are zygodactylous. Juveniles are drabber and may contain some rufous coloration on the wing. The adults have a narrow, red orbital ring while the juveniles&#x27; is yellow. Black-billed cuckoo chicks have white, sparsely-distributed, sheath-like down that contrasts heavily with their black skin. They also have complex, creamy-colored structures on their mouth and tongue, which may appear like warts or some type of parasitic infection however they are normal for the species.
==Habitat==
&quot;C. erythropthalmus&quot; may be found in a variety of habitats. They are most commonly found around the edges of mature deciduous or mixed forests and much less frequently in coniferous forests. They can also be found in much younger-growth forests with a lot of shrubs and thickets. Wetlands with a lot of alder and willow are another prime location to see them. Lastly, they can also inhabit more open areas such as abandoned farmland, golf courses, and residential parks. Whatever the habitat may be, they are usually quite well hidden and tend to stick to the edges of these habitats. The chosen habitat must also have a water source nearby such as a lake, river, marsh, or pond. On their wintering grounds in South America, they can inhabit tropical rainforests, deciduous or semi open woodlands as well as scrub forests.
==Range==
When breeding, the species is distributed in wooded areas across much of the United States, east of the Rockies. Their range just barely extends into North Carolina, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. They are not present to the south of those states when breeding. They can also be found in the southern regions of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. Furthermore, they are also present in the maritime provinces of Prince Edward Island, eastern New Brunswick, and western Nova Scotia. When migrating in spring and fall, they can also be seen in southern United States as well as all of Central America. They migrate to northwestern South America in the fall, where they will spend the winter. Although they are mainly an eastern North American species, there have been confirmed reports of sighting in British Columbia, Washington, and California. The species is also a rare vagrant to western Europe and Greenland.

==Behavior==

===Feeding===

These birds forage in shrubs or trees. They mainly eat insects, especially tent caterpillars, but also some snails, eggs of other birds, and berries. It is known to beat caterpillars against a branch before consuming them to remove some of the indigestible hairs. The remaining hairs accumulate in the stomach until the bird sheds the stomach lining and disgorges a pellet in a manner similar to owls.

Invasive spongy moths may also serve as an important food source for black-billed cuckoos. Most birds cannot consume spongy moth caterpillars because of their hair-like setae however, cuckoos can consume them because of their ability to shed their abdominal lining. During outbreak years of these insects, the abundance of black-billed cuckoos increased on Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes. This increase is not due to a higher reproductive rate because then the black-billed cuckoo populations would only increase the next year. The abundance is higher because the cuckoos flock towards the outbreak areas. This is supported by the fact that cuckoo abundance is actually lower than average in the areas surrounding the outbreaks, suggesting a large influx of the birds towards the outbreaks. They are able to find these areas due to post-migratory nomadic behavior. Once reaching their breeding ground, they search vast expanses of forest for the most suitable breeding area, in this case, where there is an abundance of food. Similar patterns have also been observed during outbreaks of tent caterpillars, fall webworms, and cicadas.

===Vocalization===
When they are a couple of days old, the chicks can make a buzzing sound that resembles an insect and a few days later, they can make a low barking call when disturbed. The call of this species is 2–5 sets of &quot;coo&quot; notes that are high-pitched, rapid, and repetitive. There is a slight pause between each set. The phonetics are often written &quot;coo-coo-coo-coo, coo-coo-coo-coo, coo-coo-coo-coo, ...&quot;. Adults usually call during the day when breeding, however they begin calling at night, in the middle of summer.

===Reproduction===

Prior to copulation, the male lands on a branch near the female with an insect in its beak. The female will then flick her tail up and down intermittently for about 15 minutes while the male sits there motionless. The male then mounts the female, with the insect still in its mouth, and the two copulate. The male then either eats the food item or gives it to the female for her to eat.

Females usually lay 2–3 blue-green eggs, sometimes 4 or 5, which may take on a marbled appearance after a couple of days of incubation. Adults incubate the eggs for 10–13 days. The young black-billed cuckoos, as well as other cuckoos in the genus &quot;Coccyzus&quot;, leave the nest 7–9 days after hatching, which is quite young when compared to other birds. The young are not able to fly right away, however they can still move quite large distances by jumping between tree branches. During this period, they are more vulnerable to predators because they cannot fly away as the adults could. Due to this vulnerability, the juveniles can slowly assume an erect posture to conceal themselves. They stretch their neck out and point their bill upwards, while keeping their eyes open and remaining motionless. If the threat starts to back off, the cuckoo will relax its pose.

Outbreaks of tent caterpillars can have a positive effect on black-billed cuckoo populations. During these outbreaks, the adults begin laying eggs earlier in the season. They can also produce larger clutches and may even increase their parasitic activities.
===Brood parasitism===
Black-billed cuckoos generally build their own nests, weaving loose structures of twigs, dried leaves, and pine needles about above the ground. However, in years with an abundance of food sources (such as outbreaks of periodical cicadas), the species may engage in brood parasitism. They can lay eggs in the nests of other black-billed cuckoos, called conspecific parasitism, or in the nests of other birds, known as interspecific parasitism. The females will usually parasitize nests in the afternoon because the nests are often unguarded at this time. This cuckoo species is thought to have a laying interval of about a day so if two eggs show up in a nest on the same day, you can rightfully assume that one is a parasitic egg.

==Taxonomy==
The black-billed cuckoo was originally placed in the genus &quot;Cuculus&quot;. This genus comprises Old World cuckoos that are all obligate brood parasites. Upon further genetic testing, it was placed into the genus &quot;Coccyzus&quot; that comprises nine species of New World cuckoos. The black-billed and yellow-billed cuckoos are the only two that migrate into North America while the other seven are permanent residents of either Central or South America. Even though these two cuckoos overlap in range, they are not sister taxa. This suggests that the two species invaded North America separately. Although the family Cuculidae is monophyletic, the genus &quot;Coccyzus&quot; was found to be polyphyletic.

==Conservation==
Although the black-billed cuckoo is classified as Least Concern (LN) on the IUCN red list, its population is still on the decline. It faces many of the same challenges as many other North American songbirds. Pesticides are having a large effect on them because the chemicals are depleting their food resources. Other threats include the loss of habitat, especially in their wintering tropical habitats, as well as urbanization. As with other migratory birds, they frequently encounter large buildings on their migratory routes which they may collide with, resulting in death.

<text>In mathematics, a topological space is said to be &quot;σ&quot;-compact if it is the union of countably many compact subspaces.

A space is said to be &quot;σ&quot;-locally compact if it is both &quot;σ&quot;-compact and (weakly) locally compact. That terminology can be somewhat confusing as it does not fit the usual pattern of σ-(property) meaning a countable union of spaces satisfying (property); that&#x27;s why such spaces are more commonly referred to explicitly as &quot;σ-compact (weakly) locally compact&quot;, which is also equivalent to being exhaustible by compact sets.

==Properties and examples==

* Every compact space is &quot;σ&quot;-compact, and every &quot;σ&quot;-compact space is Lindelöf (i.e. every open cover has a countable subcover). The reverse implications do not hold, for example, standard Euclidean space (R&quot;n&quot;) is &quot;σ&quot;-compact but not compact, and the lower limit topology on the real line is Lindelöf but not &quot;σ&quot;-compact. In fact, the countable complement topology on any uncountable set is Lindelöf but neither &quot;σ&quot;-compact nor locally compact. However, it is true that any locally compact Lindelöf space is &quot;σ&quot;-compact.
*(The irrational numbers) formula_1 is not &quot;σ&quot;-compact.
*A Hausdorff, Baire space that is also &quot;σ&quot;-compact, must be locally compact at at least one point.
* If &quot;G&quot; is a topological group and &quot;G&quot; is locally compact at one point, then &quot;G&quot; is locally compact everywhere. Therefore, the previous property tells us that if &quot;G&quot; is a &quot;σ&quot;-compact, Hausdorff topological group that is also a Baire space, then &quot;G&quot; is locally compact. This shows that for Hausdorff topological groups that are also Baire spaces, &quot;σ&quot;-compactness implies local compactness.
* The previous property implies for instance that R&quot;ω&quot; is not &quot;σ&quot;-compact: if it were &quot;σ&quot;-compact, it would necessarily be locally compact since R&quot;ω&quot; is a topological group that is also a Baire space.
* Every hemicompact space is &quot;σ&quot;-compact. The converse, however, is not true; for example, the space of rationals, with the usual topology, is &quot;σ&quot;-compact but not hemicompact.
* The product of a finite number of &quot;σ&quot;-compact spaces is &quot;σ&quot;-compact. However the product of an infinite number of &quot;σ&quot;-compact spaces may fail to be &quot;σ&quot;-compact.
* A &quot;σ&quot;-compact space &quot;X&quot; is second category (respectively Baire) if and only if the set of points at which is &quot;X&quot; is locally compact is nonempty (respectively dense) in &quot;X&quot;.

<text>From Zero was an American nu metal band from Chicago, Illinois.

==History==
===Formation and major label debut===
From Zero was formed in 1998. From Zero&#x27;s music was distinguished from many earlier nu metal groups with its greater focus on melodies and correspondingly fewer elements of rap metal.

In 1999, the band independently released their self-titled EP (referred to as &quot;The Green Album&quot;). The album locally sold over 6,000 copies and attracted the attention of major record labels. They later signed with Arista Records and began opening for bands such as Disturbed.

Their first album, &quot;One Nation Under&quot;, was released in 2001. The band promoted the album using a self-published website, allowing fans to personally communicate with band members while they were on tour. They began touring with bands such as Amen, Nickelback, Godsmack, Deftones, and Puddle of Mudd. The song &quot;Check Ya&quot; from the album peaked at number 37 on the Mainstream Rock chart.

The band was promoted by the &quot;Real World: Back to New York&quot; residents while the cast were working for Arista. Their song was panned as being &quot;overproduced&quot;.

===Sophomore album and breakup===
In 2003, the band released the album &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; on Arista. Bassist Rob Ruccia left the band before the release of the album to pursue a career in music production, and the band recruited Avi Kopernik to play bass. Ruccia, along with members of Nonpoint, would later launch the independent record label 361 Degrees Records.

After being dropped by Arista less than a month after the release of &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;, they went to work preparing for their third album. Song writing did not progress, so Jett began to concentrate on a day job to support his family. Joe Pettinato, who already had a construction business, then left the band, and the rest of the group followed. Two songs from the intended album, &quot;Middle of the Road&quot; and &quot;My Own Destiny&quot;, were able to be streamed on their official PureVolume page before the service shut down.

<doc id="346700" wikidata="Q464287" url="?curid=346700" title="Pierre Cauchon">
<text>Pierre Cauchon (; 1371 – 18 December 1442) was a French Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Beauvais from 1420 to 1432. He was a strong partisan of English interests in France during the latter years of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. He was the judge in the trial of Joan of Arc and played a key role in her execution. The Catholic Church overturned his verdict in 1456.

==Background==
Cauchon came from a middle-class family in Rheims. He entered the clergy as a teenager and went to Paris, where he studied at the University of Paris. Cauchon was a brilliant student in the liberal arts. He followed with studies in canon law and theology and became a priest.

==Early career==
By 1404, Cauchon was curé of Égliselles and sought a post near Rheims. He defended the University of Paris in a quarrel against Toulouse. Cauchon sought advancement through noble patronage. He allied himself with Duke John the Fearless of Burgundy and later his successor, Philip the Good.

In 1407, Cauchon was part of a mission from the crown of France to attempt to reconcile the Schism between the rival claimants to the papacy: Boniface IX and Gregory XII. Although the delegation failed to achieve its goal, it raised Cauchon&#x27;s prestige as a negotiator.

Upon Cauchon&#x27;s return, he found Paris in turmoil over the assassination of the Duke of Orléans under orders from John the Fearless. Many suspected that the duke had been having an affair with Queen Isabeau. University theologians sympathized with John and published a justification of the assassination as tyrannicide by arguing that the Duke of Orléans had been planning to usurp the throne.

It is also known that Cauchon had been the dean of the University of Paris, where he had studied, and that, by 1423, he became Henry VI of England&#x27;s personal counsellor.

==The choice of the Burgundian party==
The French Estates-General opened in 1413 to raise funds for an expected war against the English. Cauchon formed part of a commission charged with proposing sanctions and reforms. During the riots of that year he was associated with the Burgundians and the Cabochiens (radical reformers) and was later banished from Paris on May 14, 1414. The next year, Cauchon became the official ambassador of the Duke of Burgundy. Bishop Cauchon supported the election of Pope Martin V. Shortly afterward, Cauchon became archdeacon of Chartres; canon of Rheims, Châlons, and Beauvais; and chaplain of the Duke of Burgundy. Cauchon took part in the royal marriage negotiations surrounding the Treaty of Troyes. He became Bishop of Beauvais in 1420.

==Alliance with the English==
Bishop Cauchon spent most of the next two years in service to the king. He returned to his diocese with the deaths of Charles VI and Henry V. He departed for a visit to Rheims in 1429 when Joan of Arc and the French army approached for the coronation of Charles VII. Cauchon had always allied with the opposition to Charles VII. Shortly after the coronation, the French army threatened Cauchon&#x27;s diocese. He went to Rouen, seat of the English government in France.

The English regent, the Duke of Bedford, was anxious to preserve the claim of his nephew and charge Henry VI of England, grandson of Charles VI and nephew of Charles VII, to the throne of France, as per the Treaty of Troyes. Cauchon escorted Henry from London to Rouen as part of a clerical delegation. Shortly after he returned, he learned that Joan of Arc had been taken captive near Compiègne. The Burgundians held her at the keep of Beaulieu near Saint-Quentin.

Cauchon played a leading role in negotiations to gain Joan of Arc from the Burgundians for the English. He was well paid for his efforts. Cauchon claimed jurisdiction to try her case because Compiègne was in his diocese of Beauvais. 

==The trial of Joan of Arc==
The goal of Joan of Arc&#x27;s trial was to discredit her, and by implication to discredit the king she had crowned. Cauchon organized events carefully with a number of ecclesiastics, many of whom came from the pro-English University of Paris. The trial opened on 21 February 1431. Concerned for the regularity of the proceeding, Bishop Cauchon forwarded a bill of indictment to Paris in order to obtain the opinion of university clerics, who agreed with the charges. In the meantime, the trial continued. Joan was unwilling to testify on several subjects. The court considered torturing her. The court proceeded to official admonition on the field of the abbey of Saint-Ouen. As Cauchon read her sentence of condemnation, she agreed to abjure. Shortly afterward she recanted and was burned at the stake on 30 May 1431.

==New appointment==
Cauchon could not hope to go back to Beauvais, which had fallen under French control. He was interested in a vacancy at the archbishop&#x27;s palace at Rouen. Facing heartfelt opposition, he gave up that project. In December, Cauchon accompanied the Cardinal of Winchester to crown the boy king Henry VI of England as King of France in Notre-Dame in Paris. Finally, he obtained an appointment as Bishop of Lisieux (29 January 1432 – 15 December 1442).

When constable Arthur de Richemont returned to favour with Charles VII of France in 1436, Cauchon went as ambassador to the Council of Basel. He was active for the unsuccessful English side in the peace negotiations that ended in reconciliation between the French and the Burgundians.

Cauchon divided his later years between his new diocese and a residence in Rouen. His last action was to finance construction of a vault at the cathedral of Saint-Pierre de Lisieux. Cauchon died abruptly of heart failure at the age of 71 on 15 December 1442 in Rouen. He was buried in Lisieux Cathedral beneath the vault he had patronised. There is not any marking that indicates the exact location of his burial site, but his skeleton was re-discovered during a renovation of the pavement of the vault in 1931. When the renovation works were finished, no markings were added.

According to George Bernard Shaw in his 1923 play &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, Cauchon&#x27;s body was later dug up and thrown into a sewer; in fact it was Jean d&#x27;Estivet, one of the promoters of the trial, who was found dead in a sewer.

<text>Performance Driving is categorized as a driver of an automobile utilizing specific techniques to maximize the performance potential (See also vehicle dynamics) of the automobile during acceleration, turning, and braking maneuvers, typically while driving at a facility dedicated——and specifically constructed——to host automobile motorsport competitive events.

&quot;Performance Driving&quot; may also be called &quot;Car Control&quot;, and the skills can be learned in a variety of ways:
*Books describing the techniques
*Videos/ DVDs demonstrating the techniques
*Attending a school organized specifically to teach the techniques

Methods utilized:
*Separation of Controls
**Brake
**Throttle
**Steering
*Vision/ Use of Eyes
*Visualization
*Anticipation
*Muscle Memory
*Practice techniques

The for this technique is the performance characteristics of the modern automotive tire. The tires on your car have a specific maximum amount of grip (one component of &#x27;grip&#x27; being friction). The tire is also load sensitive——that is the maximum grip developed at any instant in time is dependent upon the force applied at the tire to tarmac interface. The driver has great influence upon the load on a given tire and also the rate at which that load is applied to the tire.

<doc id="346703" wikidata="Q1138492" url="?curid=346703" title="Mexico City policy">
<text>The Mexico City policy, sometimes referred to by its critics as the global gag rule, is a United States government policy blocking U.S. federal funding for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing abortion counseling or referrals, advocated to decriminalize abortion, or expanded abortion services. When in effect, the Mexico City policy is a U.S. government policy that requires foreign non-governmental organizations to certify that they will not &quot;perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning&quot; with non-U.S. funds as a condition for receiving U.S. global family planning assistance, and during its January 23, 2017 implementation any other U.S. global health assistance, including U.S. global HIV (under PEPFAR) and maternal and child health (MCH) assistance.

The Mexico City policy was first implemented on January 20, 1985, by the second Reagan administration. Since that time, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has enforced the policy during all subsequent Republican administrations and has rescinded the policy at the direction of all Democratic administrations. After its initial implementation by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1985, the policy was rescinded in 1993 by Democratic President Bill Clinton, reinstated in 2001 by Republican President George W. Bush, rescinded in 2009 by Democratic President Barack Obama, reinstated in 2017 by Republican President Donald Trump, rescinded in 2021 by Democratic President Joe Biden, and reinstated in 2025 by Trump again.

Research shows that by reducing funding for family planning organizations that use abortion as one of many methods of family planning, the Mexico City policy has had the impact of increasing unintended pregnancies and abortions. By reducing access to modern contraception and information about family planning and sexual transmitted disease, the policy has been linked to higher maternal and infant mortality rates, as well as higher incidence rates of HIV.

== Scope of the policy ==

The policy requires non-governmental organizations to &quot;agree as a condition of their receipt of [U.S.] federal funds&quot; that they would &quot;neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations&quot;. The policy has exceptions for abortions performed in response to rape, incest, or life-threatening conditions.

== History of the policy ==
Named for Mexico City, the venue of the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development where it was announced, the policy was instituted by U.S. President Ronald Reagan in 1984. The final language of the 1984 policy was negotiated by the deputy chairman of the U.S. delegation, Alan Keyes, then an Assistant Secretary of State.

After the establishment of the Mexico City policy, organizations were required to meet its specified conditions in order to be eligible for federal funding from the United States, and as a result, several international abortion agencies no longer received a portion of their funds from this source. The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) did not alter its operation and lost more than 20% of its total funding. Other family planning organizations, such as the Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia and the Planned Parenthood Association of Zambia, likewise did not make the changes required by the Mexico City policy and had their funding cut. NGOs in Romania and Colombia adapted to the new U.S. guidelines and continued to qualify for federal funding.

In 1987 and 1988, the policy was challenged by two U.S. Appeals court rulings in &quot;DKT Memorial Fund Ltd. vs. USAID&quot;, involving Phil Harvey and two foreign NGOs, and &quot;Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. v. USAID&quot;. Ultimately, the two court rulings contributed to the policy being used only against foreign NGOs, while not invoked against U.S. NGOs. President Bill Clinton rescinded the Mexico City policy on January 22, 1993. He referred to the policy as being &quot;excessively broad&quot; and stated that it had &quot;undermined efforts to promote safe and efficacious family planning programs in foreign nations&quot;. On January 22, 2001, President George W. Bush reinstated the policy, stating, &quot;It is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion, either here or abroad. It is therefore my belief that the Mexico City Policy should be restored&quot;. In September 2007, Barbara Boxer, a Senator from California, created an amendment designed to lift the funding conditions put in place by the Mexico City policy. It passed by a vote of 53–41. President Bush promised to veto any legislation which would eliminate the Mexico City policy. The policy was rescinded again by President Barack Obama on January 23, 2009, and further reinstated on January 23, 2017 by President Donald Trump. Trump not only reinstated the policy but expanded it, making it cover all global health organizations that receive U.S. government funding, rather than only family planning organizations that do, as was previously the case. This includes offices such as USAID, the Department of State, Global Aids Coordinator, Center of Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Health, and Department of Defense.

The nature of the policy has implications for organizations in certain countries such as South Africa. Even if these organizations support the policy itself, it is illegal for them not to inform a woman seeking an abortion of her rights, and/or refer her to a facility where she may have an abortion. The President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) was excluded from the Mexico City policy under the George W. Bush administration, but was not excluded after the Mexico City policy was reinstated on January 23, 2017.

In May 2017, Rex Tillerson announced an expansion of the policy; originally a ban covering roughly $600 million in family planning money, the Trump policy since then applied to all international health care aid doled out by the U.S. government — nearly $9 billion.

The Mexico City policy was rescinded again by President Joe Biden on January 28, 2021. On January 24, 2025, President Donald Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy.

=== Impact ===
A 2011 study that examined Sub-Saharan Africa found that the Mexico City policy had the unintended consequence of increasing the number of abortions, with the authors suggesting that the reduction in financial support for family planning organizations led to a greater number of accidental pregnancies. A 2015 study of Ghana found that the policy increased unintended pregnancies and abortions. In a 2017 editorial for &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, Stanford University health experts Nathan Lo and Michele Barry said that research showed the policy increases unintended pregnancies and abortions. They wrote that &quot;the reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy is a stark example of &#x27;evidence-free&#x27; policymaking that ignores the best scientific data, resulting in a policy that harms global health and, ultimately, the American people.&quot; 2017 editorials in &quot;The BMJ&quot; by University of Michigan Medical School health experts and &quot;The Lancet&quot; by University of Toronto, Columbia University, and Guttmacher Institute health experts concluded the same.

According to a 2019 study in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, the implementation of the Mexico City policy during the George W. Bush administration (2001–2009) unintentionally led to more abortions. By limiting funding for family planning organizations, which use abortion as one of many methods of family planning, use of contraceptives reduced and pregnancies increased. When the Mexico City policy was in effect under the Bush administration, the abortion rate was 64% higher in thirteen countries highly affected by the policy than in other comparable countries. Under the immediately preceding Bill Clinton administration when the policy was not in effect, the abortion rate in the thirteen countries was 8% lower than in the other comparable countries. The authors of the study estimate that Bush&#x27;s imposition of the Mexico City policy increased the abortion rate in the thirteen countries by 40%, and the rest of the increase had other causes. In her 2019 book &quot;The Global Gag Rule and Women&#x27;s Reproductive Health&quot;, Rutgers University economist Yana van der Meulen Rodgers commented that Mexico City policy had not reduced abortions, likely increased unsafe abortions, and adversely affected health outcomes for men, women, and children.

== Views ==
The policy originally enacted from 1984 to 1993 spoke to abortion only, not family planning in general. In 2001, the policy was re-implemented and expanded to cover all voluntary family planning activities, and critics began to refer to it as the &quot;global gag rule&quot;. These critics argue that the policy not only reduces the overall funding provided to particular NGOs, it closes off their access to USAID-supplied condoms and other forms of contraception. They argue this negatively impacts the ability of these NGOs to distribute birth control, leading to a downturn in contraceptive use and from there to an increase in the rates of unintended pregnancies and abortion. A study of nations in sub-Saharan Africa suggests that unintended pregnancies increased and abortions approximately doubled while the policy was in effect. Critics also argue that the ban promotes restrictions on free speech, as well as restrictions on accurate medical information; it has also been proved that the policy inhibited women worldwide from access to gynecological exams, AIDS prevention and treatment, and contraceptive options, and halted shipment of condoms and contraceptives to more than 20 countries.

The Holy See supports the Mexico City policy, while the European Parliamentary Forum on Population and Development presented a petition to the United States Congress signed by 233 members condemning the policy. The forum has stated that the policy &quot;undermines internationally agreed consensus and goals&quot;. Supporters of the policy have argued, using the example of the Philippines, that the ban prevents overseas health organizations from using U.S. government funds to contravene the contraception and abortion laws of the countries in which they operate. Supporters also argue that the policy prevents the health agencies from promoting abortion at the expense of other birth control methods.

The Sandbæk Report of the European Union, which calls for the funding of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), was seen by some Catholic commentators as a contrast to the Mexico City policy. The European commissioner Poul Nielson said that the European Union wished to &quot;fill the decency gap&quot; left by the Mexico City policy.

The UNFPA states that it does not &quot;provide support for abortion services&quot;. Anti-abortion individuals and organizations have accused the UNFPA of supporting forced abortions by the Chinese government. The Bush administration withheld funding from the agency due to concerns about its alleged involvement. A 2002 U.S. State Department investigation found &quot;no evidence&quot; that UNFPA knowingly took part in forced abortions. The organization has stated that it &quot;has never, and will never, be involved in coercion in China or any part of the world&quot;.

In 2010, the Harper government in Canada announced a maternal health development aid plan for the upcoming G8 summit which did not include financial support for abortion or contraception, drawing comparisons to the Mexico City policy.

== In popular culture ==
An episode of the television series &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, &quot;Squid Pro Quo&quot;, which originally aired on May 9, 2006, featured a case involving USAID&#x27;s withdrawal of funding to an overseas non-profit organization.

An episode of the American television series &quot;The West Wing&quot;, entitled &quot;Privateers&quot;, featured a &quot;gag rule&quot; amendment of a law for overseas aid.

<doc id="346711" wikidata="Q4692289" url="?curid=346711" title="Typology of business strategies">
<text>Business strategies can be categorized in many ways. One popular method uses the typology put forward by American academics Raymond E. Miles and Charles C. Snow in their 1978 book, &quot;Organizational Strategy, Structure, and Process&quot;.

==Miles and Snow&#x27;s typology==

Miles and Snow identify three types of competitive strategies, those adopted by defender, analyzer and prospector types of organization, and a fourth, non-strategic type of organization, whose competitive behaviour is reactive to the perceived environmental conditions within which it operates. For convenience the reactor type of approach is often characterised as a form of competitive strategy.

===Prospector strategy===
This is the most aggressive of the four strategies. It typically involves active programs to expand into new markets and stimulate new opportunities. New product development is vigorously pursued and offensive marketing warfare strategies are a common way of obtaining additional market share. They respond quickly to any signs of market opportunity, and do so with little research or analysis.

A large proportion of their revenue comes from new products or new markets. They are often highly leveraged, sometimes with a substantial equity position held by venture capitalists. The risk of product failure or market rejection is high. Their market domain is constantly in flux as new opportunities arise and past product offerings atrophy.

They value being the first in an industry, thinking that their “first mover advantage” will provide them with premium pricing opportunities and high margins. Price skimming is a common way of recapturing the cost of development. They can be opportunistic in headhunting key employees, both technical and managerial. Advertising, sales promotions, and personal selling costs are a high percentage of sales.

Typically the firm will be structured with each strategic business unit having considerable autonomy. The industry that they operate in tends to be in the introduction or growth stage of its life cycle, with few competitors and evolving technology

===Defender strategy===
This strategy entails a decision not to aggressively pursue markets. As a result, they tend to do none of the things prospectors do. A defender strategy entails finding, and maintaining a secure and relatively stable market. Rather than being on the cutting edge of technological innovation, product development, and market dynamics; a defender tries to insulate themselves from changes wherever possible.

In their attempt to secure this stable market they either keep prices low, keep advertising and other promotional costs low, engage in vertical integration, offer a limited range of products, or offer better quality products or customer service. They tend to be slower in making decisions and will only commit to a change after extensive research and analysis.

Their goals tend to be efficiency oriented rather than effectiveness oriented. The industry tends to be mature, with well defined technology, products, and market segments. Most sales tend to be repeat or replacement purchases. Individual strategic business units typically have moderate to low levels of autonomy.

===Analyzer===
The analyzer is in between the defender and prospector. They take less risk and make less mistakes than a prospector, but are less committed to stability than defenders. Most firms are analyzers. They are seldom a first mover in an industry, but are often second or third place entrants.

They tend to expand into areas close to their existing core competency. Rather than develop wholly new products.

===Reactor===
A reactor has no proactive strategy, often reacting to events as they occur, or alternatively they may have a defined strategy and organizational structure which are no longer appropriate for their commercial environment. Such businesses respond only when they are forced to by macro environmental pressures. This is the least effective of the four strategies. It is without direction or focus.

Miles, Snow &quot;et al.&quot; (1978) have identified three reasons why organizations become reactors:
* Top management may not have clearly articulated the organization&#x27;s strategy.
* Management does not fully shape the organization&#x27;s structure and processes to fit a chosen strategy.
*A tendency for management to maintain an organization&#x27;s current strategy-structure relationship despite overwhelming changes in environmental conditions.

==Empirical evidence==
The application of Miles and Snow&#x27;s typology has been widely studied both theoretically and empirically since the 1980&#x27;s. For example, a study by Stephen Shortell and Edward Zajac (1990) found the predictions generated by Miles and Snow&#x27;s typology to be generally accurate.

<text>A pedestal desk or a &quot;tanker desk&quot; is usually a large, flat, free-standing desk made of a simple rectangular working surface resting on two pedestals or small cabinets of stacked drawers of one or two sizes, with plinths around the bases. Often, there is also a central large drawer above the legs and knees of the user. Sometimes, especially in the 19th century and modern examples, a &quot;modesty panel&quot; is placed in front, between the pedestals, to hide the legs and knees of the user from anyone else sitting or standing in front. This variation is sometimes called a &quot;panel desk&quot;. The smaller and older pedestal desks with such a panel are sometimes called kneehole desks, they were intended for small spaces like boudoirs and were usually placed against a wall. The kneehole desks are also known as bureau tables (this is somewhat confusing, as these desks lack the actual bureau).

From the mid-18th century onwards, the pedestal desk has often had a top that is inlaid with a large panel of leather (sometimes with a gold- or blind-stamped border) or baize for a writing surface, within a cross-banded border. If the desk has a wooden top surface, it may have a pull-out lined writing drawer, or the pull-out may be fitted with a folding horse to serve as a .

Very few non-specialists call this form a pedestal desk. Most people usually refer to it as an executive desk, in contrast with the cubicle desk which is assigned to those who work under the executive. However, the term executive desk has been applied to so many desk forms as to be misleading, so the less-used but more precise &quot;pedestal desk&quot; has been retained here.

The pedestal desk appeared, especially in England, in the 18th century but became popular in the 19th and the 20th, overtaking the variants of the secretary desk and the writing table in sheer numbers. The French stayed faithful to the writing table or &quot;bureau plat&quot; (&quot;flat desk&quot;), which might have a matching paper-case (&quot;cartonnier&quot;) that stood upon it.

There were at least two precursors to the pedestal desk: The French bureau Mazarin (a desk named for Cardinal Mazarin) of the late 17th century and the Chinese jumu desk or scholar&#x27;s desk, which Europeans knew almost entirely at second-hand, largely from illustrations on porcelain. However, unlike the pedestal desk, these precursors had an incomplete stack of drawers and compartments holding up the two ends. The cases of drawers were raised about from the floor on legs.

When a pedestal desk is doubled in size to form a nearly square working surface, and drawers are put on both sides to accommodate two users at the same time, it becomes a partners desk. Thomas Chippendale gives designs for such tables, which were generally used in libraries, as writing tables in &quot;The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker&#x27;s Director&quot; (1753–4 and 1762).

Pedestal desks made of steel sheet metal were introduced in 1946 and were popular in America until the 1970s. Called tanker desks, they were used in institutions such as schools and business and government offices.

When the pedestal desk form is cut to about two thirds of its normal width, and one of the pedestals is replaced by legs, this is then called a right pedestal desk or a left pedestal desk, depending on the position of the pedestal. This kind of form is common for a student desk.

The pedestal desk is also one of the two principal forms of the big campaign desk, used by the military in the past. It can then be considered a portable desk in a limited way since the writing surface could be easily separated from the pedestals, to facilitate transport. The three separate elements were often fitted with large handles on the sides.

<doc id="346721" wikidata="Q1366507" url="?curid=346721" title="FairPlay">
<text>FairPlay is a family of digital rights management (DRM) technologies developed by Apple Inc. for protecting videos, books and apps and historically for music.

== Music ==
The initial version of FairPlay was created to protect music on the iTunes Store, and is the only version of FairPlay that is no longer actively used.

=== Technical details ===
FairPlay is built into the MP4 multimedia file format as an encrypted AAC audio layer. FairPlay-protected files are regular MP4 container files with an encrypted AAC audio layer. The layer is encrypted using the AES algorithm. The master key required to decrypt the audio layer is also stored in encrypted form in the MP4 container file. The key required to decrypt the master key is called the &quot;user key&quot;. When a user registers a new computer with iTunes, the device requests authorization from Apple&#x27;s servers, thereby gaining a user key. Upon attempting to play a file, the master key stored within the file is then matched to the user key, and if successful, allows playing. FairPlay allows music to be synchronized to an unlimited number of iPods and tracks to be burned to an unlimited number of CDs, though a given playlist can only be burned 7 times without being modified (a limitation which can be circumvented by changing a song&#x27;s placement). Playback is limited to five computers which were authorized through iTunes; a computer can be deauthorized and another authorized in its place. Before April 2004, the limits were ten playlist burns, and three computers; Apple reduced the playlist limit to seven due to demands from record labels.

=== Lawsuit ===
In January 2005, an iTunes customer filed a lawsuit against Apple, alleging that the company broke antitrust laws by using FairPlay with iTunes in a way that purchased music would work only with the company&#x27;s own music player, the iPod, freezing out competitors. In March 2011, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported that Apple&#x27;s then-CEO Steve Jobs would be required to provide testimony through a deposition. In May 2012, the case was changed into a class action lawsuit. Around the same time, the main antitrust allegation was changed to cover the belief that Apple had deliberately updated the iTunes software with security patches in a way that prevented synchronization compatibility with competing music stores. All iPod owners who had purchased their device between September 12, 2006, and March 31, 2009, were included in the class action lawsuit, unless they opted out. In December 2014, Apple went to trial against the claims raised, with the opposing party&#x27;s plaintiff lawyers seeking $350 million in damages for nearly eight million affected customers. A few weeks later, the case was closed, with the jury deciding in Apple&#x27;s favor, citing a then-new version of iTunes as being a &quot;genuine product improvement&quot;.

=== Circumvention/removal ===
The restrictions imposed by FairPlay, mainly limited device compatibility, have sparked criticism, with a lawsuit alleging antitrust violation that was eventually closed in Apple&#x27;s favor, and various successful efforts to remove the DRM protection from files, with Apple continually updating its software to counteract such projects.

After the introduction of the FairPlay system, multiple parties have attempted and succeeded to circumvent or remove the encryption of FairPlay-protected files. In October 2006, Jon Lech Johansen announced he had reverse engineered FairPlay and would start to license the technology to companies wanting their media to play on Apple&#x27;s devices. Various media publications have written about DRM removal software, though Apple has continually made efforts in updating its software to counteract these options, resulting in upgraded DRM systems and discontinued DRM removal software.

==== RealNetworks and Harmony technology ====
In July 2004, RealNetworks introduced its Harmony technology. The Harmony technology was built into the company&#x27;s RealPlayer and allowed users of the RealPlayer Music Store to play their songs on the iPod. In a press release, RealNetworks argued that Harmony was a boon to consumers that &quot;frees&quot; them &quot;from the limitation of being locked into a specific portable device when they buy digital music.&quot; In response, Apple issued a statement:
We are stunned that RealNetworks has adopted the tactics and ethics of a hacker to break into the iPod, and we are investigating the implications of their actions under the DMCA and other laws.
RealNetworks launched an Internet petition titled &quot;Hey Apple! Don&#x27;t break my iPod&quot;, encouraging iPod users to sign up to support Real&#x27;s action. The petition backfired, with comments criticizing Real&#x27;s tactics, though some commentators also supported it. At the end of 2004, Apple had updated its software in a way that broke the Harmony technology, prompting RealNetworks to promise a then-upcoming fix.

In August 2005, an SEC filing by RealNetworks disclosed that continued use of the Harmony technology put themselves at considerable risk because of the possibility of a lawsuit from Apple, which would be expensive to defend against, even if the court agreed that the technology was legal. Additionally, the possibility that Apple could change its technology to purposefully &quot;break&quot; Harmony&#x27;s function raised the possibility that Real&#x27;s business could be harmed.

===== &quot;Hymn&quot; =====
Hymn (which stands for &quot;Hear Your Music aNywhere&quot;) was an open-source tool that allowed users to remove the FairPlay DRM of music bought from the iTunes Store. It was later supplanted by QTFairUse6. The Hymn project later shut down after a cease and desist from Apple.

=== Steve Jobs&#x27; &quot;Thoughts on Music&quot; open letter ===

On February 6, 2007, Steve Jobs, then-CEO of Apple, published an open letter titled &quot;Thoughts on Music&quot; on the Apple website, calling on the &quot;big four&quot; record labels to sell their music without DRM technology. According to the letter, Apple did not want to use DRM, but was forced to by the four major music labels, with whom Apple has license agreements for iTunes sales of music. Jobs&#x27; main points were:

* DRM has never been, and will never be, perfect. Hackers will always find a method to break DRM.
* DRM restrictions only hurt people using music legally. Illegal users aren&#x27;t affected by DRM.
* The restrictions of DRM encourage users to obtain unrestricted music, which is usually only possible via illegal methods; thus, circumventing iTunes and their revenues.
* The vast majority of music is sold without DRM via CDs, which have proven commercial success.

==== Reactions ====
Although the open letter initially caused mixed industry reactions, Apple signed a deal with a major record label the following month to offer iTunes customers a purchase option for a higher-quality, DRM-free version of the label&#x27;s tracks.

Jobs&#x27; letter was met with mixed reactions. &quot;Bloomberg&quot; highlighted several viewpoints. David Pakman, President of non-DRM music retailer eMusic, agreed with Jobs, stating that &quot;consumers prefer a world where the media they purchase is playable on any device, regardless of its manufacturer, and is not burdened by arbitrary usage restrictions. DRM only serves to restrict consumer choice, prevents a larger digital music market from emerging, and often makes consumers unwitting accomplices to the ambitions of technology companies&quot;. Mike Bebel, CEO of music subscription service Ruckus, explained his view that the letter was an effort to shift focus, saying that &quot;This is a way for Steve Jobs to take the heat off the fact that he won&#x27;t open up his proprietary DRM. ... The labels have every right to protect their content, and I don&#x27;t see it as a vow of good partnership to turn the tables on the labels and tell them they should just get rid of all DRM... He is trying to spin the controversy.&quot; An anonymous music label executive said that &quot;it&#x27;s ironic that the guy who has the most successful example of DRM at every step of the process, the one where people bought boatloads of music last Christmas, is suddenly changing his tune&quot;. In an article from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ted Cohen, managing partner at TAG Strategic, commented that the change could be &quot;a clear win for the consumer electronics device world, but a potential disaster for the content companies&quot;. The Recording Industry Association of America put particular emphasis on Jobs&#x27; self-rejected idea about licensing its FairPlay technology to other companies, saying that such licensing would be &quot;a welcome breakthrough and would be a real victory for fans, artists and labels&quot;.

==== iTunes Store DRM changes ====
In April 2007, Apple and the record label EMI announced that iTunes Store would begin offering, as an additional higher purchasing option, tracks from EMI&#x27;s catalog encoded as 256 kbit/s AAC without FairPlay or any other DRM. In January 2009, Apple announced that the entire iTunes Store music catalog would become available in the higher-quality, DRM-free format, after reaching agreements with all the major record labels as well as &quot;thousands of independent labels&quot;. Apple Music, Apple&#x27;s subscription-based music streaming service launched on June 30, 2015, uses the DRM technology.

==FairPlay Streaming==
FairPlay Streaming (FPS) protects video transferred over HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) on iOS devices, in Apple TV, and in Safari on macOS. The content provider&#x27;s server first delivers video to the client application encrypted with the content key using the AES cipher. The application then requests a session key from the device&#x27;s FairPlay module. The session key is a randomly generated nonce which is RSA encrypted with the provider&#x27;s public key and delivered to the provider&#x27;s server. The provider&#x27;s server encrypts the content key using the session key and delivers it to the FairPlay module, which decrypts it and uses it to decrypt the content for playback.

On iOS and Apple TV, the session key handling and content decryption is done in the kernel, while on macOS it is done using Safari&#x27;s FairPlay Content Decryption Module.

== Books ==
== Apps ==
Apps downloaded from the App Store are protected and code signed using a variant of FairPlay DRM for apps. FairPlay DRM creates a public/private key pair when a device is registered with an iCloud account, and encrypting app encryption keys using the &quot;public&quot; key (which is kept on Apple&#x27;s servers) in order to decrypt them on the device using the &quot;private&quot; key.

=== Problems ===
In July 2012, an issue with the creation of FairPlay-protected apps caused binaries to become corrupt and stop working.

A flaw allowing a form of man-in-the-middle attack can be used to install malware when an iOS device is connected to a computer.

<doc id="346733" wikidata="Q283958" url="?curid=346733" title="Jelena Dokic">
<text>Jelena Dokic (; ; born 12 April 1983) is an Australian tennis commentator, sports analyst and former professional player. Her highest ranking as a tennis player was world No. 4, in August 2002. She won WTA Tour events on all surfaces during her career.

In the 1999 Wimbledon Championships the 16-year-old Dokic achieved one of the biggest upsets in tennis history, beating Martina Hingis 6–2, 6–0 in the first round. This remains the only time the women&#x27;s world No. 1 has ever lost to a qualifier at Wimbledon. Dokic went on to reach the quarterfinals of that competition, only her second Grand Slam championship.

Dokic rapidly ascended through the rankings after her Wimbledon breakthrough, but her time in the world elite was beset by off-court struggles. Her relationship with her outspoken father and coach Damir Dokić, on whose advice she switched allegiance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in November 2000, was the subject of much media speculation over many years. She switched back to Australia in 2005. Dokic made a serious return to tennis in 2008 and finished 2009 back in the WTA top 100, but thereafter struggled badly with form and injuries, and ceased playing professionally in 2014.

She wrote of physical and mental abuse by her father in her 2017 autobiography &quot;Unbreakable&quot;. In November 2024, a feature-length documentary film based on the book, titled &quot;Unbreakable: The Jelena Dokic Story&quot;, was released in Australian cinemas.

==Early life and education==
Jelena Dokić was born on 12 April 1983 in Osijek, SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia, to a Serb father, Damir Dokić, and a Croat mother, Ljiljana (née Podnar). She has a younger brother, Savo, eight years her junior. 

Her family lived in Osijek until June 1991 when, due to the instability of the breakup of Yugoslavia, they settled in Sombor, Serbia, for a short time before immigrating to Australia in 1994 when Dokić was 11 years of age. She has spoken of growing up in poverty, and at one time (after the family left Croatia for Serbia) they lived in a shed infested with rats.

Upon arrival in Australia they lived in Fairfield, a suburb of Sydney, where Dokić (later Dokic) attended Fairfield Public School without knowing any English when she started, and then Fairfield High School. 

From the time she first picked up a tennis racquet as a young child, through becoming a tennis champion as a teenager, and then through most of her career, her father was violent and abusive towards her, taking all of her winnings, and beating her frequently.

==Tennis career==

===Juniors===
In 1998, she won the US Open girls&#x27; singles title and the French Open doubles with Kim Clijsters, ending the season ranked world No. 1 in the junior singles rankings and world No. 7 in doubles. She was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder.

===1999–2000: Major breakthrough===
Dokic started the year by teaming up with Mark Philippoussis to win the Hopman Cup title. Until 2016, it was Australia&#x27;s lone victory at the event. She then received a wildcard into the Australian Open, losing to world No. 1, Martina Hingis, in two sets. At Wimbledon, Dokic had her breakthrough: As a qualifier, she caused an upset, defeating world No. 1 Hingis in the first round, in straight sets. Ranked No. 129 at the time, she was the lowest-ranked player to have defeated the top seed in a Grand Slam tournament in the Open era. She also defeated ninth-seeded Mary Pierce in straight sets, before losing in three to Alexandra Stevenson in the quarterfinals. Dokic also reached her first WTA Tour doubles final with Amanda Coetzer in Tokyo. During 1999, she jumped 298 spots, finishing the year at world No. 43.

Dokic was defeated in the first round of the 2000 Australian Open by Rita Kuti-Kis of Hungary. After the match, Dokic said, &quot;I lost to a player who has never been a player and, I guess, probably never will be.&quot; During the spring clay court season, Dokic reached the quarterfinals of the Tier I events in Hilton Head, South Carolina and Rome (upsetting Venus Williams en route), as well as earning Fed Cup victories over Kim Clijsters, Anna Kournikova and Sandrine Testud, respectively. However, Dokic lost in the second round at the French Open.

Her successes at Wimbledon continued; she advanced to the semifinals where she lost to Lindsay Davenport. She reached the fourth round of the US Open and lost to Serena Williams, after holding two set points in the first-set tiebreaker. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, representing Australia, she lost to Monica Seles in the bronze medal match. In doubles, she teamed with Rennae Stubbs, but lost in the second round. Dokic finished the year at world No. 26.

===2001: First career titles and top 10===
Beginning with the Australian Open, she began playing for Yugoslavia. Her father, Damir, claimed irregularities in the draw after her first-round loss to Lindsay Davenport and was banned from the tournament due to abusive behaviour. Damir later said, &quot;I think the draw is fixed just for her&quot;. This resulted in intense media speculation then and over the years.

After the Australian Open, her family moved to the United States. In May, she won her first singles title in the Rome Masters, defeating Amélie Mauresmo in the final 7–6, 6–1. Later that year in doubles, she teamed with Conchita Martínez to reach the final of the French Open, where they were defeated by Virginia Ruano Pascual and Paola Suárez, in straight sets.

Later that year in singles, she reached five finals, winning two titles, in Tokyo (defeating former world No. 1 Arantxa Sánchez Vicario), and the Kremlin Cup (defeating Elena Dementieva). She also won her second title in doubles in Linz, with Nadia Petrova, and qualified for the WTA Tour Championships in singles, reaching the quarterfinals. She finished the year as the world No. 8. The Yugoslav Olympic Committee declared her its Athlete of the Year for 2001.

===2002: Highest ranking===
Dokic reached the final of the Open Gaz de France, where she was forced to hand a walkover to Venus Williams, after her first victory over Monica Seles a day earlier, due to a right thigh strain suffered in her win. In April, she won her fourth singles title in Sarasota, Florida, defeating Tatiana Panova in the final. At the Hamburg event, Dokic collected a straight-set win over Justine Henin, before having to retire in the semifinals. Dokic was unable to defend her Italian Open title, losing to 11th-seeded Anastasia Myskina in the third round.

In Strasbourg, she reached her fifth final, losing to Silvia Farina Elia. At the French Open, she was defeated by top-seeded Jennifer Capriati in the quarterfinals. Dokic then won her fifth career singles title in Birmingham, defeating Myskina in the final in two sets. She then lost in the fourth round at Wimbledon to Daniela Hantuchová.

After Wimbledon, Dokic reached the final of the Acura Classic in San Diego, scoring her first win over Jennifer Capriati in a three-set match. In the final, she was defeated by Venus Williams. She also reached the semifinals of Los Angeles, losing to Chanda Rubin, and Montreal, notching a victory over Martina Hingis, before retiring hurt against Capriati. Despite a loss to Elena Bovina in the second round of the US Open, Dokic reached her career-high singles ranking of world No. 4. She then reached the semifinals in Salvador, Bahia and Tokyo. Dokic again qualified for the WTA Tour Championships, losing in the quarterfinals to Serena Williams. She finished the year ranked world No. 9 in singles.

In doubles, Dokic won titles in Sarasota (with Elena Likhovtseva), Los Angeles (with Kim Clijsters) and Linz (with Nadia Petrova), as well as reaching the finals of Moscow and Zürich (both with Petrova). This success resulted in her career-high doubles ranking of world No. 10.

===2003–2004: Out of top 10===
In 2003, Dokic hired Borna Bikić from Croatia to replace her father as her trainer whom she accused of &quot;wrecking her career&quot;, after several outbursts and volatile behavior at tennis tournaments. By this time, she had also been estranged from her family due to a brief relationship with Brazilian racing driver Enrique Bernoldi. She played 30 events, reaching one final, one semifinal and seven quarterfinals. At Wimbledon she narrowly lost in the third round 4–6, 4–6 to a 16-year-old Maria Sharapova. At Zürich, she beat the then-world No. 1 player Clijsters, but lost to Henin in the final. She and Petrova also reached a final in doubles in Rome. She played in the 2004 Fed Cup for the Serbia and Montenegro team and achieved two wins.

In mid-2004, Dokic returned to her family in Serbia to attempt a reconciliation. In November 2005, after a turbulent period of 4–5 months during which she cancelled all her tennis commitments and not even her family knew her whereabouts, she returned to Australia proclaiming, &quot;I am an Australian, I feel like an Australian and I want to play for Australia again.&quot; She later identified her switch to Yugoslavia as the biggest regret of her career, and said her father was subjecting her to extreme physical and mental abuse at the time he made the decision for her.

===2005–2008: ITF Circuit===
Representing Australia for the first time in five years, Dokic received a wildcard into the Auckland Open in Auckland, but lost her first-round match to Julia Schruff, hitting 51 unforced errors and 28 double faults. Dokic then earned a wildcard berth at the Australian Open after winning the wildcard playoff. She held a match point on her opponent Virginie Razzano&#x27;s serve and hit a forehand winner that caught the line, only to have the umpire rule the ball out. She went on to lose the match, hitting over 70 unforced errors.

Later that year, Dokic played in the qualifying tournament for Wimbledon, where she received a wildcard but suffered a three-set loss to Alexandra Stevenson. Under the guidance of new coach Nikola Pilić, after over three months away from the tour due to injury, Dokic qualified for a $10k tournament and reached the semifinals of the main draw before losing to Astrid Besser. In November 2006, Dokic denied reports from her father that she had been kidnapped by her boyfriend, Tin Bikić.

In her interview, she said she would not play in the 2007 Australian Open because she was not ready and her aim was to get back into the top 30. Shortly after, Dokic left the Nikola Pilić Tennis Academy. She was due to sign a contract to be in the academy for a year, but instead returned to Borna Bikić, her coach. Dokic said she was not satisfied with the contract Pilić&#x27;s academy offered her. After withdrawing from several ITF events in the early 2007, Dokic lost in the early rounds of two $10k events in Rome. She then continued to withdraw from events. Back in Australia on 17 October, Dokic released a statement through Tennis Australia that she would use their facilities in an attempt to make a comeback.

Dokic said she had not felt &quot;within herself&quot; to play during 2007 but was now ready to put in the hard work necessary to get back to the top. She cited Mary Pierce, Jennifer Capriati and Andre Agassi as inspirational figures for her goal of reaching the highest echelons of tennis once more. Dokic&#x27;s long-awaited return to tennis came during the Australian Open Wildcard Playoff, where she was hoping to earn a place in the first major of 2008. She emerged from the round-robin stage with a 3–0 record before retiring in her quarterfinal match while trailing 6–3, 3–1 due to a thigh strain.

Dokic received a wildcard for the qualifications of the 2008 Hobart International and won four matches to reach the second round of the main draw, where she retired in her match against Flavia Pennetta due to an ankle injury. She received a qualifying wildcard into the Australian Open but lost in the second round. After a three-month layoff, Dokic finally returned to action at the Morocco Open in Fes, where she qualified but lost in the first round to Gréta Arn. She then entered the following week in a $25k tournament in Florence, Italy, and won saving two match points against Mirjana Lučić in the quarterfinals, and defeating seventh-seeded Lucie Hradecká in the final. A week later, Dokic continued her winning streak by capturing the $25k tournament in Caserta, Italy.

She was then offered a wildcard to the Internationaux de Strasbourg, where she lost in the first round to Swiss Timea Bacsinszky. In July, she won her third $25k in Darmstadt. Following a period with less successful results, Dokic took a temporary break, withdrawing from all ITF tournaments during September and early October. She returned in mid-October after being awarded a wildcard for qualifying into the Tier II Linz tournament. There, she won her first round match against Petra Martić before losing to world No. 63, Jill Craybas, in the second round.

In December, Dokic again played the Australian Open Wildcard Playoff event, where she emerged from the round-robin stage with a 2–1 record, subsequently winning through to the final playoff, in which she had a tough match against Monika Wejnert, coming out a victor and earning a wildcard into the 2009 Australian Open. After the match, Dokic said:

During the play-offs, Dokic said in a press conference that she had ambitions to play in the Fed Cup for Australia in 2009. Subsequently, she was awarded a main-draw entry into the inaugural Brisbane International event.

===2009: Comeback===

Dokic was knocked out of the Brisbane International by Amélie Mauresmo in straight sets in the first round. Dokic was up 5–3 in the first set before Mauresmo came back to win the tiebreak 11–9. In the second set, Dokic was down 3–5 but rallied to lead 6–5 before Mauresmo won the set in a tiebreak, 7–5. Dokic then received a qualification wildcard into the Hobart International but withdrew before her first match because of an Achilles tendon injury.

Dokic won her first round match at the Australian Open against Tamira Paszek of Austria. It was her first major match win since 2003. She then defeated world No. 17, Anna Chakvetadze, in the second round, 6–4, 6–7, 6–3 and 11th-seeded Caroline Wozniacki in the third round. This was the first time she had reached the fourth round of the Australian Open. Dokic then advanced to the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time since 2002, after defeating 29th-seeded Alisa Kleybanova. Dokic&#x27;s run ended when she was defeated by Dinara Safina in a three-sets quarterfinal. Because of this tournament, her ranking improved to world No. 91.

In an interview after her first-round win at the Australian Open, Dokic said that she still had no contact with her father, but was building relationships again with her mother and younger brother, and that she had been dating her boyfriend, Tin Bikić, for five years.

In Fed Cup, Australia was in the Fed Cup Asia/Oceania Zone Group I. Dokic defeated all three of her opponents in straight sets, Lee Jin-a of Korea, Suchanun Viratprasert of Thailand, and Diane Hollands of New Zealand.

She lost against qualifier Tatjana Malek in the first round 6–3, 5–7, 2–6, after serving 16 double faults. Dokic was then diagnosed as suffering from glandular fever and had to withdraw from the Swedish Open in Båstad.

Prior to the first Grand Slam event, Dokic participated in two Australian Open warm-up tournaments. She opened the season at the Brisbane International, where she lost to former world No. 1, Ana Ivanovic, in three sets in the first round. She then travelled to Hobart to play the Hobart International where she defeated Elena Baltacha in the first round but lost to second seed, Shahar Pe&#x27;er, in a disappointing second-round match, 2–6, 2–6 with Dokic making over 40 unforced errors. She was seen breaking down on court as well as crying after this match. As well as the singles, Dokic also participated in the doubles event at this tournament, trying to start a new combination with compatriot Alicia Molik. However, the pair lost in the first round to Chan Yung-jan and Monica Niculescu.

She then travelled to Melbourne to compete at the Australian Open. Dokic was defeated there in the first round by 27th seed Alisa Kleybanova. The loss caused her rank to drop to world No. 96. She also played doubles, partnering with Petra Kvitová, but the pair lost in the first round.

With this win, Dokic was back in the top 100, ranked 96. The next week, she participated at a $75k tournament in Vancouver, where she won her third straight title after defeating Virginie Razzano in a two-sets final, capping a 15-match winning streak. Dokic has the most $50k or more titles in the ITF Circuit.

Though she returned to the top 100 after winning three tournaments and 15 matches in a row, Dokic lost in the first round qualifying draw of the US Open to Laura Robson.

Jelena retired in her second-round match against Urszula Radwańska leading 7–5, 0–2, with a suspected thigh injury. Dokic revealed that she had an elbow injury in the beginning of the year (possibly the reason she withdrew in tournaments such as Miami). Also, she explained that she did not take part in a lot of tournaments in the second half of the year to recover from injury and to deal with her coaching situations.

In December, Dokic participated in the Australian Open Wildcard Playoff tournament. In the round-robin stage, she won all three of her matches and a spot in the semifinal round where she defeated Alicia Molik. However, Dokic lost to Olivia Rogowska in the final. Despite missing out on a wildcard spot, the organisers awarded her a wildcard for the Australian Open main draw. Dokic finished the year ranked 138.

===2011: First WTA Tour trophy after eight years===
Dokic started her 2011 campaign by receiving three main-draw wildcards during the Australian summer, in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. She comfortably won her first match in Brisbane against qualifier Anastasia Pivovarova but then lost to in-form, eventual finalist, Andrea Petkovic. After the match Dokic cited a stomach virus as the reason to the loss. In Sydney, she lost to Svetlana Kuznetsova in the first round.

In the Australian Open, Dokic easily dispatched Zuzana Ondrášková in the first round, but fell to Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová in the second round.

At the Open GdF Suez in Paris, Dokic won all three qualifying matches for a spot in the main draw. Dokic then upset the 30th-ranked Lucie Šafářová, a 2010 finalist, for a spot in the second round. This victory was Dokic&#x27;s first victory over a top-30 player since the 2009 Australian Open. She backed up her strong performance by defeating fifth seed and former doubles partner, Nadia Petrova in straight sets in the second round to advance to her first WTA quarterfinals appearance since the 2009 Australian Open. However, her run ended after Kim Clijsters beat her despite leading 3–0 in the first set, in a victory that brought Clijsters back to world No. 1. Nevertheless, Dokic&#x27;s strong performance in the Premier event brought Dokic back to the top 100, at No. 91, and a main-draw wildcard of the Dubai Tennis Championships.

In the first round of Dubai, Dokic, hindered by illness, committed 41 unforced errors and 11 double faults to give victory to an in-form Flavia Pennetta losing. Following the loss, Dokic travelled to Doha to participate at the qualifying draw of Qatar Open. She comfortably won her first match but lost in the second match to fellow Australian, Jarmila Groth.

Dokic traveled to Kuala Lumpur where she scored her biggest win of the year by upsetting world No. 5, 2010 French Open champion, and top seed Francesca Schiavone in the first round, despite serving 15 double faults. This is her first win against a top-5 player since 2003, where she defeated then world number one player Kim Clijsters in Zurich. She then defeated Japan&#x27;s Kurumi Nara in the second round, to advance to her second WTA quarterfinal this year. She reinforced this win by upsetting an in-form Bojana Jovanovski, the eighth seed, in straight sets. This victory saw Dokic advance to her first WTA semifinals since Pan Pacific Open in Japan in February 2004. Dokic faced a resurgent Michaëlla Krajicek of the Netherlands, who had defeated defending champion Alisa Kleybanova in the second round and prevailed to advance to her first WTA Tour singles final since the Zürich Open in October 2003. She concluded the tournament by beating Lucie Šafářová in the final, after saving two championships points in the second set tiebreak and being down 1–3 in the final set. This was Dokic&#x27;s first career title under Australian flag and first since June 2002 where she won the Birmingham Classic. Her strong performance rose her ranking to world No. 61.

Originally electing to strategically skip the qualifying stage of Indian Wells to compete in a $100k tournament in the Bahamas, Dokic then withdrew from the $100k tournament. Dokic&#x27;s next tournament was Miami where she had to play the qualifying round. Dokic won both of her matches against Tatjana Malek and Christina McHale to advance to the main draw, where she fell to a resurgent former world No. 1, Dinara Safina in two sets.

Dokic then started her clay season campaign by participating at Charleston, where she was upset in the first round by qualifier Anna Tatishvili, in three close sets. She then participated at Fes as the sixth seed but was forced to withdraw due to a viral illness. This also subsequently forced Dokic to withdraw from Estoril and missed both Madrid and Rome. She finalised her preparation for the French Open by playing at Strasbourg. She defeated Fes finalist Simona Halep in the first round in just 48 minutes, dropping only one point on serve in the second set. Dokic then fell to resurgent former child prodigy Mirjana Lučić. Despite this, Dokic&#x27;s victory over Halep will ensure that she will reach the top 60 for the first time since 2009, with a year-high ranking of 59. In Roland Garros, Dokic lost to Vera Dushevina in the first round. She also participated in doubles partnering with Melanie Oudin but the pair lost in the first round to Alexandra Dulgheru and Magdaléna Rybáriková. In spite of an early exit from the clay Grand Slam, Dokic&#x27;s ranking rose to No. 57.

After Roland Garros, Dokic participated at Copenhagen as the seventh seed but lost to a qualifier, Galina Voskoboeva, in the first round. Dokic then rebounded with a victory over Alla Kudryavtseva at &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch in two sets. She then upset fourth seed Flavia Pennetta in the second round to avenge her loss in Dubai, ensuring her third quarterfinal appearance of the year. In the quarterfinals, Dokic faced Swedish player Johanna Larsson whom she dispatched, setting up a semifinal berth against Romina Oprandi, who had upset world No. 2, Kim Clijsters, in the second round. She won the match 6–4, 2–0 (ret.) to ensure her second final appearance of the year against Roberta Vinci. Dokic was edged out in three close sets. Despite the loss, Dokic&#x27;s run to the final ensured that for the first time since October 2004, she will be ranked in the top 50—at world No. 45.

Dokic&#x27;s next tournament was Wimbledon where she lost to sixth seed Francesca Schiavone in the first round. despite being a favourite to upset. She also participated in doubles, partnering with Bojana Jovanovski but fell to third seed Liezel Huber and Lisa Raymond in the first round.

Dokic&#x27;s next scheduled tournament was Budapest, but she decided to withdraw to recover from a hamstring injury. The same injury forced her to withdraw from the tournament in Bad Gastein and Baku as well. Dokic then participated in Washington as the fourth seed, but her lack of match play saw her fall in the first round to China&#x27;s Zhang Shuai. She played in San Diego, but was defeated in three tight sets to Ayumi Morita with her 15 double faults being highlighted as the main concern for the match. Since then, Dokic did not play any further matches due to a shoulder injury. Despite this setback, Dokic took part in the main draw of the US Open. She reached the second round but lost to Jelena Janković, in straight sets.

On 27 September, Dokic went back to Belgrade, Serbia, and reconciled with her father. Dokic then participated in the qualifying round of Linz in October but retired, after losing the first set 3–6 in the first qualifying match to Evgeniya Rodina due to the shoulder injury that had been bothering her since July. This turned out to be Dokic&#x27;s last match in 2011.

===2012–2014: Struggles with form, injury===
Dokic began her 2012 season in Auckland where she lost in the first round to Mona Barthel. Then, she received a wildcard to compete in Sydney. In the first round, she defeated fellow Australian Isabella Holland to set up a clash against eight seeded Marion Bartoli in the second round where she lost in two sets. She also played doubles with Sofia Arvidsson where she reached the quarterfinals before losing to Raquel Kops-Jones and Abigail Spears. One week later, Dokic took part in the Australian Open. She began her campaign by defeating Anna Chakvetadze in the first round. In the second round, she met Bartoli for the second time in two weeks. Dokic&#x27;s nine double faults (some at crucial points) cost her and she lost in straight sets. She also participated in doubles and mixed doubles competitions, partnering with Kateryna Bondarenko and Paul Hanley, respectively, but lost in the first rounds of both.

Dokic travelled to Bogotá where she was the fourth seed, but lost to Paula Ormaechea. In Monterrey, she lost to eventual runner up Alexandra Cadanțu. As the defending champion and seventh seed at the Malaysian Open in Kuala Lumpur, Dokic started her campaign successfully, defeating Kristina Mladenovic but then lost against fellow Australian Olivia Rogowska, 6–3, 4–6, 6–7. Since she had failed to defend her points, she dropped out of the top 100.

She then suffered three consecutive first round losses at Indian Wells, Miami and Charleston, losing to Gisela Dulko, Ekaterina Makarova and Galina Voskoboeva. It was later revealed, Dokic had suffered from a continuing right wrist injury since the beginning of the year, explaining her poor results and retirements. Dokic was set to return to tournament play at the ITF Challenger tour in September, but was forced to cancel all commitments due to continuing problems with her wrist. In November 2012, it was announced Dokic had undergone wrist surgery and would miss the Australian summer of events.

In May 2013, Dokic said in an interview that she was training for a comeback attempt at smaller tournaments using an injury protected ranking. Again, in October 2013, she said that after a wrist operation she was training with Todd Woodbridge to try for a wildcard entry into the 2014 Australian Open. Dokic entered the Australian Open Wildcard Playoff in December 2013 but lost in the first round to Jarmila Gajdošová. She received a wildcard to play alongside Storm Sanders at the doubles competition; in the first round, the team lost to Magdaléna Rybáriková/Stefanie Vögele in what was Dokic&#x27;s final appearance in a rating event.

==Post-retirement career==
After keeping a low profile for a few years following her retirement, Dokic steadily increased her work in the Australian tennis media in the late 2010s, and became a well-known face in tennis coverage in Australia. 

She was engaged by Tennis Australia as a coach in 2014, and was pictured coaching rising Australian star Daria Gavrilova at a training camp in Italy in June 2014. She also wrote for &quot;Australian Tennis Magazine&quot; in 2014.

In January 2017, she was a commentator for Fox Sports at the Australian Open. 

In 2021 while commentating on Wimbledon for Channel Nine, Dokic praised the support Ashleigh Barty had received from her parents, prompting Dokic to become so emotional she worried she would &quot;fall apart&quot; live on air.

During the 2024 Australian Open, in a post-match interview, Dokic asked Aryna Sabalenka for one of her extra towels after her quarterfinal win. She did so again after her semifinal win, this time asking Sabalenka to sign it so that it could be auctioned off for kids and women affected by domestic violence. This coincided with ATP and Australian Open organisers allowing Alexander Zverev to continue competing in the Men&#x27;s Draw while facing domestic violence trials in Germany.

==Books and film==
Dokic&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; (), co-written with sports journalist Jess Halloran, in which she relates the story of her life, career, and the years of physical and mental abuse by her father, was published on 13 November 2017. It topped the Australian book charts within the first day of release, and was published in Europe in January 2018.

In 2023, again co-written with Halloran, she published &quot;Fearless: Finding the power to thrive&quot;, which tells of how she has survived poverty, trauma, and family violence.

A documentary film based on her autobiography, called &quot;Unbreakable: The Jelena Dokic Story&quot;, co-directed by Halloran and Ivan O&#x27;Mahoney, was released in Australian cinemas on 7 November 2024. Luke Buckmaster of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the film, giving it 4 out of 5 stars, as did Garry Maddox of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. Dokic was interviewed on ABC Radio National about her life, the book, and the film, on 8 November 2024.

==Personal life==
By the age of 21, Dokic suffered from depression, anxiety, PTSD, and an eating disorder.

In 2023, Dokic waged a public campaign calling out online trolls who targeted her about her weight and fat-shamed her. Dokic has stated that the comments made about her looks and weight have affected her mental health over the years. After appearing on the Australian Open coverage, Dokic stated that she received an uptick of abusive and harassing online comments from trolls.

In 2021, Dokic separated from her partner of 19 years, Tin Bikic.

<text>Verna Norberg Aardema Vugteveen (June 6, 1911 – May 11, 2000), best known by the name Verna Aardema, was an American writer of children&#x27;s books.

Verna Norberg was born in New Era, Michigan. She graduated from Michigan State University with a B.A. of Journalism in 1934. She worked as a grade school teacher from 1934 to 1973 and became a correspondent for the &quot;Muskegon Chronicle&quot; in 1951, a job that lasted until 1972, the year before she retired from teaching.

In her senior year at Michigan State, Norberg won three writing contests; although not her first, they were the most influential in her decision to pursue the childhood dream. She first considered writing for children when her daughter refused to eat until she&#x27;d heard one of her mother&#x27;s stories. These bribes were often set in the places that she had been reading about recently, and as she became more and more interested in Africa, they began to be set there more frequently.

In 1960, she published her first set of stories, &quot;Tales from the Story Hat&quot;, which were very successful, and so she continued to adapt traditional tales and folklore from distant cultures, (usually from Africa and Mexico) to expose young children to the vast variety of human expression.

Her book, &quot;Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People&#x27;s Ears&quot; (1975), illustrated by Leo and Diane Dillon, received the Caldecott Medal in 1976 and the Brooklyn Art Books for Children Award in 1977. &quot;Who&#x27;s in Rabbit&#x27;s House?&quot; 1977 was the 1977 School Library Journal Best Book of the Year and a Lewis Carroll Shelf Award winner in 1978. Aardema received the Children&#x27;s Reading Round Table Award in 1981, and several of her works have been selected as Notable Books by the American Library Association. Her &quot;Oh Kojo! How Could You!&quot; won the 1984 Parents&#x27; Choice Award for Literature.

==Marriages==

She first married Albert Aardema (1908-1974) and second Joel Vugteveen.

==Death==

She died in Fort Myers, Florida and is buried in Norton Cemetery, Norton Shores, Muskegon, Michigan alongside her first husband.

<text>Liberty Baptist Fellowship is a fellowship of independent Baptist churches that grew up around Jerry Falwell, Thomas Road Baptist Church of Lynchburg, Virginia, and Liberty University. Most pastors of the Fellowship are alumni of Liberty University. In 1994, the &quot;Liberty Baptist Fellowship&quot; had 100 churches, including the 21,000 member Thomas Road church, which was also affiliated with the Baptist Bible Fellowship International. In 1996, the Thomas Road church joined the newly formed Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia, thereby aligning itself with 3 Baptist bodies. 

The Liberty Baptist Fellowship (LBF) was started in 1981 with the mission of planting New Testament local churches and endorsing chaplains in the military. Since then, hundreds of churches have been planted and 24 chaplains are currently serving around the world.

LBF pastors/churches and their full-time staff receive a scholarship to the External Degree Program at Liberty University and its schools. Many have taken advantage of this scholarship. In addition, students sent from churches to Liberty University receive a scholarship.

<text>Yazhou Zhoukan () is a Chinese-language international affairs newsweekly. It was launched in 1987 by Michael O&#x27;Niell as a sister magazine to &quot;Asiaweek&quot;. It is published by Yazhou Zhoukan Limited (a subsidiary of Media Chinese International Limited), and provides international political, economic and cultural news. In December 2011, its circulation reached 150,000.

== History ==
1975–1987

&quot;Asiaweek&quot; was founded in 1975 by Michael O&#x27;Neill, a New Zealander, and T. J. S. George, an Indian, who had worked together at the &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot;. O&#x27;Niell&#x27;s experience in Asia confirms his belief that &quot;the Asian century is coming&quot;.

In 1985, Time, Inc. (as it was then known) acquired 84% of &quot;Asiaweek&quot;, buying out &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;&#x27;s 80% stake and 4% local interests. The remaining 16% was owned by Michael O&#x27;Neill.

The Chinese edition of Asiaweek, &quot;Yazhou Zhoukan&quot;, was launched in 1987 as a sister magazine to &quot;Asiaweek&quot;. O&#x27;Neill was a founding Editor-in-Chief of &quot;Yazhou Zhoukan&quot;, with Thomas Hon Wing Polin as its founding Managing Editor.

1987–1994

During the late 1980s, the People&#x27;s Republic of China introduced the reform and opening-up policy; the negotiation between the British and Chinese governments over Hong Kong was drawing to a close; and the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia was coming out of discrimination and oppression. Under this context, Michael O&#x27;Neill founded the Chinese edition of &quot;Asiaweek&quot; to attract readers from the Chinese community across Asia.

&quot;Yazhou Zhoukan&quot; was branded as &quot;the first Chinese language international affairs newsweekly&quot;; &quot;the first Chinese newsweekly to report from around the globe”; and &quot;the best medium to keep up to date with the global Chinese diaspora&quot;.

<doc id="346755" wikidata="Q1420493" url="?curid=346755" title="Conceptual graph">
<text>A conceptual graph (CG) is a formalism for knowledge representation. In the first published paper on CGs, John F. Sowa used them to represent the conceptual schemas used in database systems. The first book on CGs applied them to a wide range of topics in artificial intelligence, computer science, and cognitive science.

== Research branches ==

Since 1984, the model has been developed along three main directions: a graphical interface for first-order logic, a diagrammatic calculus of logics, and a graph-based knowledge representation and reasoning model.

=== Graphical interface for first-order logic ===

In this approach, a formula in first-order logic (predicate calculus) is represented by a labeled graph.

A linear notation, called the Conceptual Graph Interchange Format (CGIF), has been standardized in the ISO standard for common logic.

The diagram above is an example of the &quot;display form&quot; for a conceptual graph. Each box is called a &quot;concept node&quot;, and each oval is called a &quot;relation node&quot;. In CGIF, this CG would be represented by the following statement:

In CGIF, brackets enclose the information inside the concept nodes, and parentheses enclose the information inside the relation nodes. The letters x and y, which are called &quot;coreference labels&quot;, show how the concept and relation nodes are connected. In CLIF, those letters are mapped to variables, as in the following statement:

As this example shows, the asterisks on the coreference labels and in CGIF map to existentially quantified variables in CLIF, and the question marks on and map to bound variables in CLIF. A universal quantifier, represented in CGIF, would be represented in CLIF.

Reasoning can be done by translating graphs into logical formulas, then applying a logical inference engine.

=== Diagrammatic calculus of logics ===
Another research branch continues the work on existential graphs of Charles Sanders Peirce, which were one of the origins of conceptual graphs as proposed by Sowa. In this approach, developed in particular by Dau , conceptual graphs are conceptual diagrams rather than graphs in the sense of graph theory, and reasoning operations are performed by operations on these diagrams.

=== Graph-based knowledge representation and reasoning model ===
Key features of GBKR, the graph-based knowledge representation and reasoning model developed by Chein and Mugnier and the Montpellier group, can be summarized as follows:

* All kinds of knowledge (ontology, rules, constraints and facts) are labeled graphs, which provide an intuitive and easily understandable means to represent knowledge.
* Reasoning mechanisms are based on graph notions, basically the classical notion of graph homomorphism; this allows, in particular, to link basic reasoning problems to other fundamental problems in computer science (e.g., problems concerning conjunctive queries in relational databases, or constraint satisfaction problems).
* The formalism is logically founded, i.e., it has a semantics in first-order logic and the inference mechanisms are sound and complete with respect to deduction in first-order logic.
* From a computational viewpoint, the graph homomorphism notion was recognized in the 1990s as a central notion, and complexity results and efficient algorithms have been obtained in several domains.

COGITANT and COGUI are tools that implement the GBKR model. COGITANT is a library of C++ classes that implement most of the GBKR notions and reasoning mechanisms. COGUI is a graphical user interface dedicated to the construction of a GBKR knowledge base (it integrates COGITANT and, among numerous functionalities, it contains a translator from GBKR to RDF/S and conversely).

<text>The Gulf fritillary or passion butterfly (Dione vanillae) is a bright orange butterfly in the subfamily Heliconiinae of the family Nymphalidae. That subfamily was formerly set apart as a separate family, the Heliconiidae. The Heliconiinae are &quot;longwing butterflies&quot;, which have long, narrow wings compared to other butterflies.

&quot;Dione vanillae&quot; is most commonly found in the southern areas of the United States, specifically in many regions of Florida and Texas.

Gulf fritillaries have a chemical defense mechanism in which they release odorous chemicals in response to predator sightings. As a result, common predators learn to avoid this species. Pheromones play a critical role in male-female courtship behaviors, with male gulf fritillaries emitting sex pheromones that contribute to mate choice in females.

The scientific name Papilio vanillae was given to the gulf fritillary by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, based on a 1705 painting by Maria Sibylla Merian (&quot;The Metamorphosis of the Insects of Surinam&quot;, Plate XXV), which shows the adult and caterpillar of the gulf fritillary on a vanilla orchid, &quot;Vanilla planifolia&quot;. However, it is now known that the gulf fritillary caterpillar does not use the vanilla plant. The species was moved to the genus &quot;Agraulis&quot; in 1835 by Boisduval &amp; Le Conte. A phylogenetic analysis reported in 2019 placed &quot;Agraulis&quot; as a sub-genus of &quot;Dione&quot;.

== Description ==
In its adult form, the gulf fritillary is a medium-sized butterfly that has extended forewings and a wingspan range of 6.5 to 9.5 cm. This butterfly exhibits sexual dimorphism as females are typically distinctively larger in size than males. The underside of the wings is brown and speckled with silvery white dots. In contrast, the top surface layer of the wings is deep orange in color with black streaks running across. In addition to the size difference between the two sexes, females are usually darker in color and are more marked with black streaks as compared to the males.
==Geographic range==
Gulf fritillaries are found primarily in the southern parts of the contiguous United States, from Florida and Georgia to Texas and California. However, this butterfly’s range can extend from the Southern United States into parts of Mexico and Central America and sometimes as far as parts of South America. They are also found in Hawaii.

== Habitat ==
Gulf fritillaries are found in open habitats, like in moderately sunny areas near open grasslands, parks, and woodlands. Gulf fritillaries are also commonly seen in local butterfly gardens across the U.S.

==Host plants==
 The caterpillar food plants--also called the host plants--for gulf fritillaries are members of the genus &quot;Passiflora&quot;. The adult butterflies use nectar from many flowers, including &quot;Lantana&quot; plants. The Passiflora host plants are frequently called passion vines; in some Texan counties where this butterfly&#x27;s population is high, gulf fritillaries will feed on specific species such as &quot;Passiflora lutea&quot; and &quot;Passiflora affinis&quot;. These passion vine plants are suitable host plants as they provide a good structure for larval host habitats which enables young populations of gulf fritillaries to be sufficiently nurtured and protected. The role of host plants is also integral to the oviposition of gulf fritillaries, as the female butterflies lay their eggs on or near the host plant.

==Propagation==

=== Oviposition ===
The process of oviposition in gulf fritillaries begins with the female butterfly flying low and slightly above the vegetation (most likely the typical host plants like &quot;Passiflora incarnata&quot; or &quot;Passiflora lutea&quot;) and lasts until the female pauses above an individual plant. Then, the female makes contact with the host plant by landing; the female then deposits an egg to complete the process of oviposition. The driving factor behind what causes the female to oviposit on or near the host plant is most likely due to the certain chemical composition of the specific genus of the host plant. Once the female recognizes the chemical composition (by using the antennae), the female will oviposit.

==Life cycle==
===Egg===
Eggs are small and spherically shaped; the female gulf fritillary lays the eggs individually one by one on or near the host plant. Typical host plants include several species of the genus &quot;Passiflora&quot;. The eggs are initially yellow in color after deposition by the female, and they gradually turn a brownish red color over the course of the next 24 hours. The average duration of the egg stage in the life cycle for gulf fritillaries is roughly between three and five days depending on the temperature of the environment. Eggs are usually found on the upper surfaces of the leaves of the host plant, but some can be found on the underside of leaves as well.

===Larva===

In appearance, the larvae are dark orange with small black spines protruding outward from the body. The larval stages of gulf fritillaries include five instars, each with a varying timeframe. After the eggs hatch, the new larvae eat the egg casings for food. Eventually, the larvae will transition either to consuming other eggs or parts of the host plant for nourishment. Throughout the first three instar stages, the larvae primarily consume the leaves and feed away from the leaf margins of the host plant. How much of the leaf and how deep into the layers the larva will eat depend on the type (i.e. thickness or thinness) of the leaf in question. Throughout the last two instar stages, the larvae mainly consume the leaves and feed at the leaf margins. Throughout this food acquisition process, the degree to which a specific leaf is eaten before it is abandoned in favor of another newer leaf largely depends on whether food is in plentiful or scarce supply. The average duration of the larval stage is between 11 and 16 days depending on the temperature.

===Pupa===
In form and appearance, the pupae of gulf fritillaries are not recognizably uniform, but rather can vary in both coloring and physical size. The average duration of the pupal stage in gulf fritillaries is roughly between 7 and 12 days depending on the temperature of the environment. Colder temperatures are associated with a longer time frame whereas warmer temperatures are associated with a shorter time for pupal development.

===Metamorphosis===

When the time comes for the caterpillar to create its chrysalis it turns a grayish color and begins to spin a silk-like substance into a ball on top or against a malleable surface. It then attaches its rear end to the &quot;silk&quot; lump and hangs upside down in a &quot;j&quot; position. By small contractions of the muscles it begins to shed its skin and head revealing a soft pinkish tan form. Quickly the soft form hardens and becomes grayish brown. The chrysalis stays in this form for eleven to twenty-one days. After that period of time, a small crack begins to form at the tip of the chrysalis revealing the butterfly&#x27;s head. It continues to slowly move down through the bottom of the chrysalis until its legs are free to cling onto the shell of the chrysalis and pull itself the rest of the way out. Much like the monarch butterfly, it begins to pump the fluids from its bulging abdomen into its shriveled wings. When its wings are fully expanded it releases excess fluids from its abdomen. For the next ten to fifteen minutes it stays still and allows its wings to dry. Finally it fans its wings out and takes flight.
===Adult===

After the process of emerging from the chrysalis is completed, the butterfly dries its wings and eventually flies for the first time. In the adult population, the approximate sex ratio between males to females is roughly one to one, but further observational studies of gulf fritillaries are needed to better support the hypothesis of an equal sex ratio between the two dimorphic sexes. The average duration of the adult stage is roughly 14 to 27 days after the butterfly emerges from the chrysalis depending on the quality of the environment (i.e. factor in the availability of food, the presence of predators, competition between individuals).

==Migration==
With Florida constituting a major component of the geographic range of this butterfly, the migration pattern of gulf fritillaries in Florida is well-documented. In Florida, gulf fritillaries have two major flights during the year. The first major migration involves huge populations of butterflies flying northward while the second migration involves the butterflies moving southward throughout the state, especially throughout the peninsular parts of Florida. The first and second migrations occur in the spring and the fall, respectively.

==Defense against predators==
Both male and female gulf fritillaries possess certain defensive glands located on their abdomens that serve as a defense mechanism against predators, especially avian predators such as birds. When the butterflies sense danger in the area or are suddenly disturbed, these glands emit a distinct and obvious odor which is composed of several different types of chemicals, such as 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and hexadecyl acetate. The summation of these chemical compounds released from the glands leads to birds preferentially avoiding the gulf fritillaries in favor of other prey. In some cases, gulf fritillaries can sometimes be subjected to competition and fighting from other butterfly species, such as &quot;Heliconius charithonia vazquezae&quot; and &quot;Dryas iulia moderata&quot; when those species have breeding populations in similar areas and within the same geographic range.

==Mating==
===Courtship behavior===
The general process for a typical courtship interaction begins when a male flies and lands near a perching female, who is most likely perched on a host plant, such as several species of the Passiflora genus. Once the male has landed, the male assumes a position next to the female with their heads together and with their bodies aligned at a 45-degree angle. At this time, the male engages in a specific action called the wing clap display in which the male continuously claps its wings open and closed. During this time, the antennae of the female are placed between the opening and closing wings. After the male ceases wing movement, the male butterfly will move into a position that facilitates genital contact with the female. The average duration of the copulation process including the wing clap display is approximately 11 seconds.

===Female and male interactions===
====Pheromones====
The release of pheromones by the male gulf fritillaries plays a critical role in the mating and courtship process. Studies have shown that the males possess specific structures on their dorsal wings that engage in the production and eventual release of chemical pheromones. It is likely that pores that exist on the wings of the male butterflies transport the pheromones to the surface where the chemicals can be released and can then affect the females. The use of pheromones in the mating process relates to the idea of mate choice.

====Nuptial gifts====
Along with chemical pheromones, the presence of nuptial gifts plays an important role in the mating and courtship process. During the physical act of copulation, males transfer nutritious materials to the females. These extra nutrients given to the females can be used by a female to her advantage during the process of oogenesis. The use of nuptial gifts in the mating process, especially when females mate with multiple males, relates to the idea of female choice in deciding egg fertilization.

<text>In science, engineering, and other quantitative disciplines, order of approximation refers to formal or informal expressions for how accurate an approximation is.

==Usage in science and engineering==
In formal expressions, the ordinal number used before the word order refers to the highest power in the series expansion used in the approximation. The expressions: a zeroth-order approximation&quot;, a first-order approximation&quot;, a &quot;second-order approximation&quot;, and so forth are used as fixed phrases. The expression a &quot;zero-order approximation&quot; is also common. Cardinal numerals are occasionally used in expressions like an &quot;order-zero approximation&quot;, an &quot;order-one approximation&quot;, etc.

The omission of the word &quot;order&quot; leads to phrases that have less formal meaning. Phrases like first approximation or to a first approximation may refer to &quot;a roughly approximate value of a quantity&quot;. The phrase to a zeroth approximation indicates &quot;a wild guess&quot;. The expression &quot;order of approximation&quot; is sometimes informally used to mean the number of significant figures, in increasing order of accuracy, or to the order of magnitude. However, this may be confusing, as these formal expressions do not directly refer to the order of derivatives.

The choice of series expansion depends on the scientific method used to investigate a phenomenon. The expression order of approximation is expected to indicate progressively more refined approximations of a function in a specified interval. The choice of order of approximation depends on the research purpose. One may wish to simplify a known analytic expression to devise a new application or, on the contrary, try to fit a curve to data points. Higher order of approximation is not always more useful than the lower one. For example, if a quantity is constant within the whole interval, approximating it with a second-order Taylor series will not increase the accuracy. 

In the case of a smooth function, the &quot;n&quot;th-order approximation is a polynomial of degree &quot;n&quot;, which is obtained by truncating the Taylor series to this degree. The formal usage of &quot;order of approximation&quot; corresponds to the omission of some terms of the series used in the expansion. This affects accuracy. The error usually varies within the interval. Thus the terms (&quot;zeroth&quot;, &quot;first&quot;, &quot;second,&quot; etc.) used above meaning do not directly give information about percent error or significant figures. For example, in the expansion of the exponential function,
formula_1
the zeroth-order term is formula_2 the first-order term is formula_3 second-order is formula_4 and so forth. If formula_5 each higher order term is smaller than the previous. If formula_6 then the first order approximation,
formula_7
is often sufficient. But at formula_8 the first-order term, formula_3 is not smaller than the zeroth-order term, formula_10 And at formula_11 even the second-order term, formula_12 is greater than the zeroth-order term. 

=== Zeroth-order ===
&quot;Zeroth-order approximation&quot; is the term scientists use for a first rough answer. Many simplifying assumptions are made, and when a number is needed, an order-of-magnitude answer (or zero significant figures) is often given. For example, &quot;the town has a few thousand residents&quot;, when it has 3,914 people in actuality. This is also sometimes referred to as an order-of-magnitude approximation. The zero of &quot;zeroth-order&quot; represents the fact that even the only number given, &quot;a few&quot;, is itself loosely defined. 

A zeroth-order approximation of a function (that is, mathematically determining a formula to fit multiple data points) will be constant, or a flat line with no slope: a polynomial of degree 0. For example,

: formula_13
: formula_14
: formula_15

could be – if data point accuracy were reported – an approximate fit to the data, obtained by simply averaging the &quot;x&quot; values and the &quot;y&quot; values. However, data points represent results of measurements and they do differ from points in Euclidean geometry. Thus quoting an average value containing three significant digits in the output with just one significant digit in the input data could be recognized as an example of false precision. With the implied accuracy of the data points of ±0.5, the zeroth order approximation could at best yield the result for &quot;y&quot; of ~3.7 ± 2.0 in the interval of &quot;x&quot; from −0.5 to 2.5, considering the standard deviation. 

If the data points are reported as 
: formula_16
: formula_17
the zeroth-order approximation results in
: formula_18
The accuracy of the result justifies an attempt to derive a multiplicative function for that average, for example,

: formula_19

One should be careful though, because the multiplicative function will be defined for the whole interval. If only three data points are available, one has no knowledge about the rest of the interval, which may be a large part of it. This means that &quot;y&quot; could have another component which equals 0 at the ends and in the middle of the interval. A number of functions having this property are known, for example &quot;y&quot; = sin π&quot;x&quot;. Taylor series is useful and helps predict an analytic solution, but the approximation alone does not provide conclusive evidence.

===First-order===
&quot;First-order approximation&quot; is the term scientists use for a slightly better answer. Some simplifying assumptions are made, and when a number is needed, an answer with only one significant figure is often given (&quot;the town has , or &quot;four thousand&quot;, residents&quot;). In the case of a first-order approximation, at least one number given is exact. In the zeroth-order example above, the quantity &quot;a few&quot; was given, but in the first-order example, the number &quot;4&quot; is given.

A first-order approximation of a function (that is, mathematically determining a formula to fit multiple data points) will be a linear approximation, straight line with a slope: a polynomial of degree 1. For example:

: formula_16
: formula_17
: formula_22

is an approximate fit to the data.
In this example there is a zeroth-order approximation that is the same as the first-order, but the method of getting there is different; i.e. a wild stab in the dark at a relationship happened to be as good as an &quot;educated guess&quot;.

===Second-order===
&quot;Second-order approximation&quot; is the term scientists use for a decent-quality answer. Few simplifying assumptions are made, and when a number is needed, an answer with two or more significant figures (&quot;the town has , or &quot;thirty-nine hundred&quot;, residents&quot;) is generally given. As in the examples above, the term &quot;2nd order&quot; refers to the number of exact numerals given for the imprecise quantity. In this case, &quot;3&quot; and &quot;9&quot; are given as the two successive levels of precision, instead of simply the &quot;4&quot; from the first order, or &quot;a few&quot; from the zeroth order found in the examples above.

A second-order approximation of a function (that is, mathematically determining a formula to fit multiple data points) will be a quadratic polynomial, geometrically, a parabola: a polynomial of degree 2. For example:

: formula_16
: formula_17
: formula_25

is an approximate fit to the data. In this case, with only three data points, a parabola is an exact fit based on the data provided. However, the data points for most of the interval are not available, which advises caution (see &quot;zeroth order&quot;).

===Higher-order===
While higher-order approximations exist and are crucial to a better understanding and description of reality, they are not typically referred to by number.

Continuing the above, a third-order approximation would be required to perfectly fit four data points, and so on. See polynomial interpolation.

==Colloquial usage==
These terms are also used colloquially by scientists and engineers to describe phenomena that can be neglected as not significant (e.g. &quot;Of course the rotation of the Earth affects our experiment, but it&#x27;s such a high-order effect that we wouldn&#x27;t be able to measure it.&quot; or &quot;At these velocities, relativity is a fourth-order effect that we only worry about at the annual calibration.&quot;) In this usage, the ordinality of the approximation is not exact, but is used to emphasize its insignificance; the higher the number used, the less important the effect. The terminology, in this context, represents a high level of precision required to account for an effect which is inferred to be very small when compared to the overall subject matter. The higher the order, the more precision is required to measure the effect, and therefore the smallness of the effect in comparison to the overall measurement.

<text>A diploma is a document awarded by an educational institution (such as a college or university) testifying the recipient has graduated by successfully completing their courses of studies. Historically, it has also referred to a charter or official document of diplomacy.

The diploma (as a document certifying a qualification) may also be called a &quot;testamur&quot;, Latin for &quot;we testify&quot; or &quot;certify&quot; (testari), so called from the word with which the certificate begins; this is commonly used in Australia to refer to the document certifying the award of a degree. Alternatively, this document can simply be referred to as a degree certificate or graduation certificate, or as a &quot;parchment&quot;. The certificate that a Nobel laureate receives is also called a diploma.

The term diploma is also used in some historical contexts, to refer to documents signed by a monarch affirming a grant or tenure of specified land and its conditions (see Anglo-Saxon charters and diplomatics).

==Usage==

===Australia===
In Australia, there are three varieties of Diploma currently recognized by the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF):
* a &quot;Diploma&quot;, a level five qualification (Undergraduate Degree) granted by vocational education and training (VET) sector or university. It is typically completed with 12 to 18 months of full-time study. When accepted for credit as part of a bachelor&#x27;s degree, it is usually deemed to be equivalent to the first year of the degree. 
* an &quot;Advanced Diploma&quot;, which is equivalent to an Australian &quot;Associate Degree&quot; and is equivalent to the second year of a bachelor&#x27;s degree.
* a &quot;Graduate Diploma&quot;, which is undertaken after completing a bachelor&#x27;s degree (or being deemed to have equivalent knowledge). This can be in a field other than that covered by said degree (e.g., the Graduate Diploma of Education which was historically required to become a schoolteacher in most Australian states, since 2016 the schoolteacher requirement in Australia is now a master&#x27;s degree in Teaching). It can also be a coursework-only qualification undertaken as additional study in a specialisation within one&#x27;s degree area.

The Diploma, Advanced Diploma and Graduate Diploma are all forms of Degrees, with a Diploma (Level five) qualification, being the entry level for Higher Education.

The &quot;Vocational Graduate Diploma&quot; was a short lived AQF qualification equivalent to the &quot;Graduate Diploma&quot;, intended to be delivered exclusively in the VET sector. On 1 January 2015, all such qualifications being offered lost the word &quot;Vocational&quot; from their title.

===Canada===
In Ontario, Canada, diplomas are two and three year academic post-secondary programmes taught by colleges and institutes of applied studies, arts, and technology. Two year programmes are referred to as college diplomas, while three year programmes are called Ontario College Advanced Diplomas. Baccalaureate degrees in Ontario are commonly a year longer than an Advanced Diploma and are offered by both colleges and universities.
The Canadian school system uses credits to calculate the value of a course load towards a diploma. To graduate and earn a diploma, the school decides how many credits each course contributes towards the diploma. For example, one college course delivered over 14 weeks of a semester counts for 3 credits towards the 60 credits for a complete 2-year program.

===Germany and the German academic education system in Europe===

In Germany, Ukraine, Serbia, Croatia, Hungary and other countries that adopted the German academic education system, diploma (in German &quot;Diplom&quot;) is the standard academic degree, needing at least 3.5 years to complete it, being comparable with a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree in one.

===Greece===

In Greece, diplomas can be awarded by educational institutes as a proof of a certain educational level. The diploma in engineering is a degree provided by Greek technical universities and universities after the successful completion of a five-year integrated study programme and it is equivalent to the Master of Engineering degree, which is awarded by the European universities.

Also in Greece there are the Vocational Training Diploma (Post-Secondary Education EQF 5 level) provided by the National Qualifications and Vocational Guidance Organization (E.O.P.P.E.P.) to the Vocational Training Institutes IEK, following certification exams carried out by the E.O.P.P.E.P. 
===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, Diploma or Advanced Diploma/Certificate (Qualifications Frameworks Level 4), Professional Diploma/Certificate (Qualifications Frameworks Level 4), higher diploma, and associate degree are below the level of the bachelor&#x27;s degree.

Certificate (not Post-Graduate Certificate) Qualifications Frameworks Level 3 or below; are below the level of Diploma, Advanced or Professional Diploma/Certificate (Qualifications Frameworks Level 4), Higher Diploma or associate degree.

Postgraduate Certificates and Postgraduate Diplomas are usually granted after the bachelor&#x27;s degree. It&#x27;s more vocational oriented than a master&#x27;s degree.

===India===

In India, a diploma is a specific academic award usually earned in professional/vocational courses, e.g., Diploma in Engineering, Diploma in Nursing, Diploma in Pharmacy, Diploma in Radiography (Diagnosis), Diploma in Medical Lab Technology etc. Engineering diplomas are concentrated for the area of study, e.g., diploma in electronics engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, etc.

There are two types of diplomas/certificates that are issued in formal and non-formal education sectors: formal diplomas are issued by government-approved/recognized institutions, colleges and universities and non-formal diplomas are issued by NGOs, companies and societies etc. outside the formal education sector.

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, a diploma is a vocational tertiary education award. There are four varieties of Diploma currently recognized by Indonesian National Qualification Framework (Indonesian: , KKNI).
===Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, a National Diploma was awarded before 2004. It was at the same level as the ordinary bachelor&#x27;s degree and below the honours bachelor&#x27;s degree, whilst the Higher Diploma is taken after the bachelor&#x27;s degree. There is BTEC Extended Diploma also after which one gets progression to a Degree (University).
In Ireland a Graduate Diploma is a Level 9 degree, the equivalent of a master&#x27;s degree, requiring the student to complete 60 credits instead of 90 and usually centring on the completion of a project rather than a written thesis.

===Japan===

In Japan, a diploma may be a Japanese original academic degree or a Certificate of Graduation issued at several levels from elementary school to university.

===Latin America===
In Mexico and other Latin American countries, a diploma may be awarded for short courses of vocational training. The university-issued diplomas finalizing higher education are most often called &quot;título&quot; (title) or &quot;certificado&quot; (certificate). A &quot;Diplomado&quot; can also be a short, specialized executive education program for experienced professionals.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, there are five different types of diploma according to the New Zealand Qualifications Framework (NZQF):
* Diploma level 5, which are level 5 qualifications according to the NZQF. They require a minimum of 120 credit points from level 4 or above and 72 from level 5 or above. 
* Diploma level 6. They require a minimum of 120 credit points from level 5 or above and 72 from level 6 or above. 
* Diploma level 7. They require a minimum of 120 credit points from level 5 or above and 72 from level 7 or above. 
* Graduate diploma. To enter a graduate diploma programme a student typically requires another degree (not necessarily a bachelor&#x27;s degree), or strong evidence of both interest and academic capability. They require a minimum of 120 credit points and 72 from level 7 or above. 
* Postgraduate diploma. These degrees require a bachelor&#x27;s degree to enter them. They require a minimum of 120 credit points from level 7 or above and 72 from level 8 or above.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, a diploma is a specific academic award usually earned in professional/vocational courses e.g. Diploma in Engineering, Diploma in Nursing, Diploma in Pharmacy etc. Engineering diploma is called Diploma of Associate Engineering (DAE) and is concentrated for the area of study, e.g., Electronics Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering etc. DAE holders are often called associate engineers in Pakistan.

Postgraduate Diploma or PGD are ranked higher than the bachelor&#x27;s degree as they are completed after graduation. These are normally a year&#x27;s worth of coursework after a university degree.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, most diplomas are awarded after a three-year course, offered by the five polytechnics (Singapore Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Temasek Polytechnic, Nanyang Polytechnic and Republic Polytechnic) or the two arts institutions (Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and LASALLE College of the Arts).

Other private schools like Kaplan, SIM, PSB Academy and MDIS, also offer diploma programmes between a period of six months and two years.

===Spain===
In the Kingdom of Spain, university diplomas are issued in the name of the King. As such, they are Public Official documents, strictly regulated and protected by the law. They are internationally recognized by the Hague Convention of 5 October 1961.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, &quot;diploma&quot; can refer to several different types of qualification but is never equivalent to a degree. A degree is higher than a diploma. One can never say that he finished a degree when he is only given a special diploma. A Diploma can be a qualification worth 37 or more credits on the Regulated Qualifications Framework, e.g. Entry Level Diploma, Level 3 Diploma. The Diploma of Higher Education is a higher education award equivalent to the second-year of a bachelor&#x27;s degree. The Higher National Diploma is a vocational qualification at the same level. A Graduate Diploma is a one-year qualification at bachelor&#x27;s degree level, normally taken by those who have already obtained a degree. A Postgraduate Diploma is an award at the level of a master&#x27;s degree, but normally taking less time to complete.

Some universities may offer other qualifications, such as the University of Cambridge&#x27;s and the University of Oxford&#x27;s Undergraduate Diploma (a 1-year, part-time course at the same level as a Diploma of Higher Education) and Undergraduate Advanced Diploma. The Undergraduate Advanced Diploma (UGAdvDip) is a FHEQ Level 6 award which is generally accepted as equivalent to a second bachelor&#x27;s degree or a Graduate Diploma. Undergraduate Advanced Diplomas are only offered at the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford.

The document certifying the award of a degree is normally called a degree certificate in the UK, and details are printed in English, not in Latin.

====Undergraduate advanced diploma====
The advanced diploma (AdvDip) is a FHEQ Level 6 award, equivalent to the final year of a bachelor&#x27;s degree. They are generally accepted as equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree or a Graduate Diploma. An advanced diploma is a qualification that prepares students to enter into a specific career or further study in an advanced degree, like a Master of Arts. Even though they are considered equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree they usually have a duration of one or two years and they can be offered both on a full-time and a part-time basis.

===United States===


In the United States, the word &quot;diploma&quot; usually refers to the physical document, especially in the context of academic degrees earned at the college or university level. That is, Americans normally draw a distinction between a diploma as documentary evidence of the award of an academic degree, and the underlying degree itself (which is not called a diploma).

The reason this distinction matters is that many American universities do not print diplomas until several weeks, months, or even up to a year &quot;after&quot; the dates on which graduates were formally awarded their degrees on their academic transcripts. In other words, when a diploma says on its face that so-and-so degree was &quot;given at [city] on [date]&quot;, the diploma itself was not physically handed to the holder on that date. (For ceremonial purposes, the documents handed out at graduation are simply certificates of participation in the graduation ceremony itself.) Thus, asking alumni when they received their diplomas is usually pointless; what really matters for most purposes (e.g., occupational licensing) is when they received their degrees. This important distinction can lead to some confusion when persons who obtained degrees at American universities are presenting their academic credentials in other countries.

There are two major exceptions where Americans have merged the document with the qualification it represents (as seen in other countries). The first is the high school diploma. Second, the term &quot;diploma&quot; can refer to a specific academic or training award. For example, the Diploma in Nursing was offered by hospital-based nursing schools.

Historically, American universities emulated their European counterparts by issuing diplomas written in the Latin language. That is now the exception today: &quot;While most colleges and universities now issue English diplomas, some prominent holdouts—including Yale, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania—still use Latin.&quot; At Harvard University, undergraduate degrees began to be written in English in 1961, leading to a street protest by students known as the &quot;Diploma Riots&quot;. However, as of 2021, some Harvard graduate schools continue to issue degrees in Latin, including Harvard Law School and the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

The term &quot;diplomate&quot; (always ending with an &quot;e&quot;) is used in the United States to refer to a person holding a specialized certification in a professional field, although the documentary evidence of this is traditionally called a &quot;certificate&quot; and not a &quot;diploma&quot;.

<text>Maurice Alberto &quot;Mo&quot; Rocca (born January 28, 1969) is an American humorist, journalist, and actor. He is a correspondent for &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot;, the host and creator of &quot;My Grandmother&#x27;s Ravioli&quot; on the Cooking Channel, and also the host of &quot;The Henry Ford&#x27;s Innovation Nation&quot; on CBS. He was the moderator of the National Geographic Society&#x27;s National Geographic Bee from 2016 until its final competition in 2019, as the 2020 and 2021 competitions were cancelled and the competition was ended in 2021. He is also the host of the podcast &quot;Mobituaries with Mo Rocca&quot; from CBS News. He is a regular panelist on the radio quiz show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;

Mo Rocca got his start in television behind the scenes, writing and producing several children&#x27;s TV shows. His first work in front of the camera came as a correspondent for news satire show &quot;The Daily Show&quot; from 1998 to 2003. He played a similar role as a satirical correspondent for &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; from 2004 to 2008, and later moved on to more serious (but still light-hearted) roles with CBS News for which he continues to work. He has also acted in theater, film, and on television in small roles from time to time, and has written two books.

==Early life and education==
Rocca was born in Washington, D.C. His mother immigrated there from Bogotá, Colombia, in 1956 at age 28, and his father was a third generation Italian-American from Leominster, Massachusetts. He attended Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit boys&#x27; school in North Bethesda, Maryland, graduating with the Class of 1987. He graduated from Harvard University in 1991 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in literature. He served as president of Harvard&#x27;s Hasty Pudding Theatricals, performing in four of the company&#x27;s notorious burlesques and co-authoring one (&quot;Suede Expectations&quot;). While at Harvard, he also played Seymour in a production of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; which co-starred future Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.

==Career==

===Film===
Rocca appeared in the 2005 film &quot;Bewitched&quot; and, in 2007, in the independent science-fiction family comedy &quot;I&#x27;ll Believe You&quot; with fellow &quot;Daily Show&quot; alumnus Ed Helms. In 2012, Rocca was the narrator of the documentary &quot;Electoral Dysfunction&quot;, a movie which satirically analyzes the American voting system and which aired on PBS in 2012 and 2016.

=== Journalism ===

In 2004, he served as a convention-floor correspondent for &quot;Larry King Live&quot; at the Democratic and Republican national conventions.

Rocca is a regular correspondent for &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot; with Jane Pauley. His work includes cover stories, features, and profiles (such as of Chris Rock and Amy Schumer) with an emphasis on presidential history.

In 2012, Rocca became a regular contributor to &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;.

=== Radio and podcasts ===
He is a regular panelist on the quiz show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; on the NPR radio network.

Rocca turned his fascination with obituaries into a podcast called &quot;Mobituaries&quot;, currently on Season 4.

===Television===
From 1998 to 2003, Rocca was a regular correspondent for &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, which gave him his start in television. His work included campaign coverage for &quot;Indecision 2000&quot; and a regular feature called &quot;That&#x27;s Quite Interesting&quot;.

He was a regular correspondent for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on the NBC TV network from 2004 to 2008, and covered the 2008 election for NBC.

Rocca created and hosted the program &quot;My Grandmother&#x27;s Ravioli&quot; with CBS Eye Productions on the Cooking Channel from 2012 to 2015, for which he traveled across the United States, learning to cook from grandmothers and grandfathers in their kitchens.

He previously hosted &quot;Food(ography)&quot; on the Cooking Channel and was a regular judge on &quot;Iron Chef America&quot; on the Food Network.

Rocca was a commentator on VH1&#x27;s &quot;I Love the &#x27;70s&quot; and &quot;I Love the &#x27;80s&quot;. He was the host of Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Things I Hate About You&quot; channel and &quot;Whoa! Sunday&quot;, which premiered in 2005 on the Animal Planet TV channel. He also made guest appearances for the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; television franchise in the episodes &quot;Authority&quot; (&quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;) and &quot;Contract&quot; (&quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;), both in 2008.

In 2014, Rocca appeared on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Milton, the accountant. He reprised the role for the 50th anniversary of the show in 2023.

He is also the host of the weekly &quot;The Henry Ford&#x27;s Innovation Nation&quot; program, which has aired as part of the CBS Dream Team on Saturdays since 2014.

On May 13, 2015, Rocca appeared on a celebrity episode of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and came in second to CNN correspondent John Berman, amassing a total of $41,600. He returned on December 6, 2023, amassing $25,200 during his quarterfinal match. He would eventually make it to the finals, once again coming in second to actress Lisa Ann Walter and winning $250,000. During both times on the show, he played in support of the Inner-City Scholarship Fund, a New York-based charity that helps low-income families enroll their children in Catholic Schools through financial aid.

Rocca moderated the finals of the National Geographic Bee from 2016 until its final competition in 2019. 

Rocca played a conservative morning TV show host in the second season of &quot;The Good Fight&quot; in 2018.

===Theater===
Rocca began his career acting on stage in the Southeast Asia tour of the musical &quot;Grease&quot; (1993) and Paper Mill Playhouse&#x27;s &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1994).

On Broadway, Rocca played the role of Vice Principal Douglas Panch in &quot;The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee&quot;.

===Writing===
His first television work was as a writer and producer for the Emmy and Peabody Award-winning children&#x27;s television series &quot;Wishbone&quot;. He also wrote for &quot;The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss&quot; on the Nickelodeon TV channel and &quot;Pepper Ann&quot; on the ABC TV network.

Rocca&#x27;s satirical book, &quot;All the Presidents&#x27; Pets: The Story of One Reporter Who Refused to Roll Over&quot;, deals with American presidents, their pets, and reporters and was published by Crown Books in 2004.

His contribution to AOL Newsbloggers was titled &quot;Mo Rocca 180°: Only Half as Tedious as the Regular News&quot;.

In 2011, he won an Emmy as a writer for the 64th Annual Tony Awards.

Rocca authored &quot;Mobituaries&quot; in 2019, a book about underappreciated people in history such as Elizabeth Jennings Graham. In February 2024, he announced that &quot;Roctogenarians&quot;, a &quot;Mobituaries&quot;-style book focusing on people who achieved success late in their lives, would be released in June.

==Personal life==
In July 2011, Rocca revealed on &quot;The Six Pack&quot; podcast (episode 73) that he is gay. 

On September 25, 2015, Rocca served as Lector during the Mass celebrated by Pope Francis at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, giving a reading in Spanish. His participation was hailed by gay rights advocates.

<doc id="346779" wikidata="Q385517" url="?curid=346779" title="Oomoto">
<text>, also known as , is a religion founded in the 1890s by Deguchi Nao (1836–1918) and Deguchi Onisaburō (1871–1948). Oomoto is often categorized as a new Japanese religion based on Shinto. The spiritual leaders of the movement have always been women within the Deguchi family, along with Onisaburō as its founding &quot;seishi&quot; (spiritual teacher). Since 2001, the movement has been guided by its fifth leader, Kurenai Deguchi.

==History==
Deguchi Nao, a housewife from the tiny town of Ayabe, Kyoto Prefecture, declared that she had a &quot;spirit dream&quot; at the Japanese New Year in 1892, becoming possessed (&quot;kamigakari&quot;) by Ushitora no Konjin (艮の金神)) and starting to transmit his words. According to the official Oomoto biography of Deguchi, she came from a family which had long been in poverty, and had pawned nearly all of her possessions to feed her children and invalid husband. Deguchi was certainly not an otherwise famous figure, and independent accounts of her do not exist. After 1895, and with a growing number of followers, she became a teacher of the Konkōkyō religion.

In 1898, Deguchi Nao met Ueda Kisaburō, who had previous studies in &quot;kamigakari&quot; (spirit possession). In 1899 they established the &quot;Kinmeikai&quot; together, which became the &quot;Kinmei Reigakkai&quot; later in the same year. In 1900, Kisaburō married Nao&#x27;s fifth daughter Sumi and adopted the name Deguchi Onisaburō. Oomoto was thus established based on Nao&#x27;s automatic writings (&quot;Ofudesaki&quot;) and Onisaburō&#x27;s spiritual techniques.

Since 1908, the group has taken diverse names — &quot;Dai Nihon Shūseikai&quot; (大日本修齋會), &quot;Taihonkyō&quot; (1913) and &quot;Kōdō Ōmoto&quot; (皇道大本) (1916). Later the movement changed from &quot;Kōdō Ōmoto&quot; (&quot;great origin of the imperial way&quot;) to just Ōmoto (&quot;great origin&quot;) and formed the &quot;Shōwa Seinenkai&quot; in 1929 and the &quot;Shōwa Shinseikai&quot; (昭和神聖会) in 1934.

Asano Wasaburō, a teacher at , attracted various intellectuals and high-ranking military officials to the movement in 1916. By 1920 the group had their own newspaper, the &quot;Taishō nichinichi shinbun&quot; (大正日日新聞), and started to expand overseas. A great amount of its popularity derived from a method of inducing spirit possession called &quot;chinkon kishin&quot; (鎮魂帰神), which was most widely practiced from 1919 to 1921. Following a police crackdown, Onisaburō banned &quot;chinkon kishin&quot; in 1923.

In March 1920, the Ōmoto-affiliated magazine &quot;Shinrei&quot; published an edition of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion in Japanese for the first time.

Alarmed by the popularity of Ōmoto, the Imperial Japanese Government, which promoted &quot;kokutai&quot; and the Imperial Way, condemned the sect for worshipping Ookunitokotachi above Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess from whom the Emperor of Japan claimed descent. This led to two major incidents when Ōmoto was persecuted under the lèse-majesté law, the and the Public Security Preservation Law of 1925. In 1921, the first Ōmoto Incident (&quot;Ōmoto jiken&quot;) resulted in the Ōmoto headquarters being destroyed, as well as Onisaburo and two adherents being jailed. In 1924, retired naval captain Yutaro Yano and his associates within the Black Dragon Society invited Onisaburo on a journey to Mongolia. Onisaburo led a group of Ōmoto disciples, including Aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba. They were captured by the forces of Chinese warlord Zhang Zuolin, but were released upon realizing they were Japanese nationals. After he returned to Japan, he organized religious allies like &quot;Jinruiaizenkai&quot; to promote a universal brotherhood and world peace. Foreign religions from Korea, China, Russia, Germany and Bulgaria, including the Red Swastika Society, joined this movement. This was followed in 1935 by the second Ōmoto Incident, which again left its headquarters in ruins and its leaders in jail; Ōmoto was effectively outlawed until the end of World War II. With the second Ōmoto Incident, Oomoto became the first religious organization who was prosecuted under the Public Security Preservation Law of 1925.

After the war, the organization reappeared as &quot;Aizen&#x27;en&quot; (愛善苑), a movement dedicated to achieve world peace, which was led by Onisaburo Deguchi&#x27;s eldest grandson Yasuaki Deguchi (出口和明). It was registered in 1946 under the Religious Corporations Ordinance. Yasuaki Deguchi considered Onisaburo rather than Nao to be the main founder of the religion, and thus used Onisaburo&#x27;s &quot;Reikai Monogatari&quot; as its main scripture.

In 1949 Ōmoto joined the World Federalist Movement and the world peace campaign. In 1952 the group returned to its older name, becoming the religious corporation Ōmoto under the Religious Corporations Law. At present time, the movement has its headquarters at Kyoto Prefecture and has a nominal membership of approximately 170,000. There is a temple for religious services in Ayabe, and a mission in a large park on the former site of Kameoka Castle that includes offices, schools, a publishing house, and shrines in Kameoka. There are also international branches, such as Oomoto do Brasil (headquartered in Jandira, São Paulo, Brazil).

==Scriptures==
The two main scriptures used in Oomoto are:
*&quot;Oomoto Shin&#x27;yu&quot; (大本神諭, 277 sections), composed during 1892–1918 (originally dictated by Nao Deguchi as the &quot;Ofudesaki&quot;; reinterpreted and edited by Onisaburo Deguchi to become the &quot;Oomoto Shin&#x27;yu&quot;)
*&quot;Reikai Monogatari&quot; (霊界物語, 81 sections), composed during 1921–1934 (dictated by Onisaburo Deguchi)

Of the two, the &quot;Reikai Monogatari&quot; is by far the most commonly consulted and used scripture in present-day Oomoto.

There are also various other less commonly used texts, such as &quot;Izunome Shin&#x27;yu&quot; (伊都能売神諭, 37 volumes, composed during 1918–1919) and the &quot;Three Mirrors&quot; or &quot;San Kagami&quot; (三鏡, 844 chapters total) by Onisaburo Deguchi, which consists of the &quot;Water Mirror&quot; (水鏡, 249 chapters), &quot;Moon Mirror&quot; (月鏡, 212 chapters), and &quot;Jade Mirror&quot; (玉鏡, 383 chapters).

==Spiritual leadership==
Oomoto&#x27;s spiritual leaders, all of whom belong to the Deguchi (出口) family are:

*Main Founder: Nao Deguchi (出口なお; 1837–1918); also referred to as the 
*Co-Founder: Onisaburo Deguchi (出口王仁三郎; 1871–1948); also referred to as the 
*Second Spiritual Leader: Sumiko Deguchi (出口すみ子; 1883–1952), Onisaburo&#x27;s wife
*Third Spiritual Leader: Naohi Deguchi (出口直日; 1902–1990), Onisaburo&#x27;s eldest daughter
*Alternate Spiritual Leader: Hidemaru Deguchi (出口日出麿) (1897–1991)
*Fourth Spiritual Leader: Kiyoko Deguchi (出口聖子; 1935–2001), Naohi&#x27;s third daughter
*Fifth Spiritual Leader: Kurenai Deguchi (出口紅; 1956–present), Kiyoko&#x27;s niece who has served as Fifth Spiritual Leader of Oomoto since 29 April 2001

Oomoto&#x27;s spiritual headquarters, called Baishō-en (梅松苑), is in Ayabe, Kyoto, due to its association with Nao Deguchi&#x27;s founding of the religion in Ayabe. However, its administrative headquarters, called Ten&#x27;on-kyō (天恩郷), is in Kameoka, Kyoto. Oomoto also has a mission center, called Tōkō-en (東光苑), in Taitō, Tokyo.

==Sacred sites==
Oomoto has numerous sacred sites, some of which are:

*Kutsujima (沓島), and nearby Kanmurijima (冠島) and Meshima (女島), considered sacred to Ushitora no Konjin (艮の金神)
*Takakuma-yama (高熊山) (354.9 metres) in Anao (穴太), Kameoka, Kyoto; Onisaburo Deguchi performed spiritual training for one week in a cave on the mountain during March 1–7, 1898
*Misen-zan (弥仙山) (664 metres) in Ayabe, where Nao Deguchi secluded herself in 1901
*Hachibuse-yama (鉢伏山) (1,221 metres) in Kami, Mikata District, Hyōgo, climbed by Onisaburo Deguchi just after World War II
*Ashiwake-yama (芦別山) (1,727 metres) in the Yūbari Mountains in Hokkaido, where the kami Kuni-no-Tokotachi-no-Mikoto (国常立尊) resides.
*Miyabaru-yama (宮原山), a mountain on Kikaijima (or Kikaigashima) in Kagoshima Prefecture, where the kami Toyokumonu-no-Mikoto (豊雲野尊) resides.

==Festivals==
Four major are held for each of the four seasons.

*, February 3, Ayabe
*, May 5, Ayabe
*, August 7 (traditionally the 12th day of 7th lunar month), Kameoka
*, or the Foundress&#x27; Festival, November 6, Ayabe

==International activities==
Since the time of Onisaburo Deguchi, the constructed language Esperanto has played a major role in the Oomoto religion. Starting in 1924, the religion has published books and magazines in Esperanto, and this continues today. Onisaburo Deguchi reportedly introduced Esperanto back when he had interfaith dialogues with the Baháʼí Faith in 1921.

Oomoto and its adherents promote the Japanese arts and culture, such as Noh theater and the tea ceremony. Oomoto is engaged in peace campaigns, aid work, and other similar activities.

From 1925 until 1933, Oomoto maintained a mission in Paris. From there, missionaries travelled throughout Europe, spreading the word that Onisaburo Deguchi was a Messiah or Maitreya who would unify the world.

==Doctrine==
The , also known as the &quot;shinjin itchi&quot; (), states that:
Original Japanese text of the &quot;Ōmoto kyōshi&quot;:
The fundamental ways to reach God are the called the :
*

 are:
*
*

 are:
*
*

==Beliefs and theology==
Omotokyo was strongly influenced by Konkokyo, Ko-Shintō (ancient Shinto) and folk spiritual and divination traditions; it also integrated Kokugaku (National Studies) teachings and modern ideas on world harmony and peace, creating a new doctrine. It shares with Konkokyo the belief in the benevolence of Konjin, who was previously considered an evil kami, and shares with other ancient Shinto schools the teachings that proclaim the achievement of personal virtue as a step to universal harmony.

===God===
The fundamental narrative is that Ushitora no Konjin, by whom Deguchi Nao was possessed, is actually Kuni-tokotachi-no-mikoto, who made the earth and was the original ruler of the world. Many years after Kunitokotachi no mikoto had made the earth and started to rule the world, other gods who learned to be bad made him retired, drove him away to the Northeast and started to call him the worst god. This is the reason why the world is full of evil, and Deguchi Nao&#x27;s prophecy was the beginning of the second rule of Kunitokotachi no mikoto, therefore a change of the world would begin soon. Through her prophecies, Ushitora no konjin warned people to stop selfishness. They even think Setsubun is persecution against Ushitora no Konjin.

Oomoto followers believe that one God created and fostered all things and lives in the universe. However, Oomoto considers individual kami to be the various manifestations of the one supreme God who created everything in the universe, called Oomoto-sume-oomikami (Japanese: 大天主太神 or おおもとすめおおみかみ). &quot;Oomoto&quot; means the &quot;Great Origin&quot;, &quot;sume&quot; means &quot;govern&quot;, and &quot;Oomikami&quot; means God. Any God but one God appears in order to realize the aim of God, therefore in Oomoto every God or thing is just another appearance of one God after all. At the same time God is energy, which is the principle of the universe, and the universal spirit everything has. And believers think Ame-no-Minakanushi is the common Creator God that all religions of the world share, including the Abrahamic religions. However, &quot;Tales of the Spirit World&quot; says the universe begins with the sudden advent of &quot;ヽ&quot;, which is called &quot;Hochi&quot;. He develops into &quot;◉&quot;, which is called &quot;su&quot;, is kotodama of su and is the great origin of god.

In Oomoto, humans are given a special role in the Universe. As the most spiritual beings in the Universe, humans are the masters of the Universe and the agents of god, and if a spirit of a human reaches god and they are united, infinity power will be generated according to the will of God.

===Kami===
Members of Oomoto believe in several kami. The most important are Ookunitokotachi, Ushitora no Konjin and Hitsujisaru. Oomoto members also tend to recognize notable religious figures from other religions, or even notable non-religious figures, as kami – for example, the creator of Esperanto, L. L. Zamenhof is revered as a god. However, all of these kami are believed to be aspects of a single God concept.

The Oomoto affirmation of Zamenhof&#x27;s godhood is stated, in Esperanto, as follows:

Translated into English, the foregoing reads:
...[T]he spirit of Zamenhof even now continues to act as a missionary of the angelic kingdom; therefore, his spirit was deified in the Senrei-sha shrine.
The belief that two kami, Kunitokodachi no Mikoto and Susano-o no Mikoto, were the original founders and rulers of Japan, who were driven away by Amaterasu Ōmikami, the divine ancestor of the imperial line, is what placed this religion in opposition to the government in pre-war Japan. However, Amaterasu-oomikami is also considered to be a righteous god.

Followers of Oomoto believe Haya-susano-o no Mikoto, who had been originally told to rule the earth by Izanagi, was punished for all the Amatsutsumi instead of all gods and is a redeemer of the world, mainly based on the story of Amano-Iwato and his expulsion from Takaamahara.

===Cosmology===
Oomoto&#x27;s goal is the realization of the world of Miroku or (&quot;the world to come&quot;), which means heaven in the real world. It is expressed in various ways, such as (mentioned at the beginning of the &quot;Oomoto Shin&#x27;yu&quot;), &quot;purification of the world&quot;, &quot;the opening of Amano-Iwato of the world&quot;, &quot;the world of clear quartz&quot;, and so on.

Oomoto recognizes two realms, the physical world and the , both of which are interconnected. In turn, the spiritual world consists of three parts:
* ()

The founder emphasized the importance of the earth and respect for it. This even led to some of Onisaburo&#x27;s ideas to be linked to agrarianism.

Their doctrine includes an idea that things that happen in Ayabe would happen in Japan or in the world. The oppression of them, consisting of the two Ōmoto incidents and consequent destruction of their facilities and organization, are considered to have been omens of World War II and consequent destruction of Japan.

==Notable followers==
* One of the more well-known followers of Oomoto was Morihei Ueshiba, a Japanese martial artist and the founder of Aikido. It is commonly thought that Ueshiba&#x27;s increasing attachment to pacifism in later years and belief that Aikido should be an &quot;art of peace&quot; were inspired by his involvement with the sect. Oomoto priests oversee a ceremony in Ueshiba&#x27;s honor every April 29 at the Aiki Shrine at Iwama.
* Yamantaka Eye – visual artist, DJ and member of avant musical group Boredoms
* Mokichi Okada, founder of the Church of World Messianity (aka &quot;Shinji Shumeikai&quot;), was a follower of Oomoto prior to founding his own religion.
* Masaharu Taniguchi, founder of Seicho-no-Ie, was also a follower of Oomoto prior to founding his own religion.
* Yonosuke Nakano (中野與之助), founder of Ananaikyo, was originally an Oomoto follower before founding his own religion.
* Alex Kerr, American writer and Japanologist, worked for the Oomoto Foundation for 20 years from 1977 on.
* Bill Roberts, American writer active at the Oomoto Foundation

<text>A modeling language is any artificial language that can be used to express data, information or knowledge or systems in a structure that is defined by a consistent set of rules. The rules are used for interpretation of the meaning of components in the structure of a programming language.

== Overview ==
A modeling language can be graphical or textual.

* &quot;Graphical&quot; modeling languages use a diagram technique with named symbols that represent concepts and lines that connect the symbols and represent relationships and various other graphical notation to represent constraints.
* &quot;Textual&quot; modeling languages may use standardized keywords accompanied by parameters or natural language terms and phrases to make computer-interpretable expressions.

An example of a graphical modeling language and a corresponding textual modeling language is EXPRESS.

Not all modeling languages are executable, and for those that are, the use of them doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that programmers are no longer required. On the contrary, executable modeling languages are intended to amplify the productivity of skilled programmers, so that they can address more challenging problems, such as parallel computing and distributed systems.

A large number of modeling languages appear in the literature.

== Type of modeling languages ==

=== Graphical types ===
Example of graphical modeling languages in the field of computer science, project management and systems engineering:
* Behavior Trees are a formal, graphical modeling language used primarily in systems and software engineering. Commonly used to unambiguously represent the hundreds or even thousands of natural language requirements that are typically used to express the stakeholder needs for a large-scale software-integrated system.
* Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN, and the XML form BPML) is an example of a Process Modeling language.
* C-K theory consists of a modeling language for design processes.
* DRAKON is a general-purpose algorithmic modeling language for specifying software-intensive systems, a schematic representation of an algorithm or a stepwise process, and a family of programming languages.
* EXPRESS and EXPRESS-G (ISO 10303-11) is an international standard general-purpose data modeling language.
* Extended Enterprise Modeling Language (EEML) is commonly used for business process modeling across a number of layers.
* Flowchart is a schematic representation of an algorithm or a stepwise process.
* Fundamental Modeling Concepts (FMC) modeling language for software-intensive systems.
* IDEF is a family of modeling languages, which include IDEF0 for functional modeling, IDEF1X for information modeling, IDEF3 for business process modeling, IDEF4 for Object-Oriented Design and IDEF5 for modeling ontologies.
* Jackson Structured Programming (JSP) is a method for structured programming based on correspondences between data stream structure and program structure.
* LePUS3 is an object-oriented visual Design Description Language and a formal specification language that is suitable primarily for modeling large object-oriented (Java, C++, C#) programs and design patterns.
* Lifecycle Modeling Language is an open-standard language for systems engineering that supports the full system lifecycle: conceptual, utilization, support and retirement stages.
* Object-Role Modeling (ORM) in the field of software engineering is a method for conceptual modeling, and can be used as a tool for information and rules analysis.
* Petri nets use variations on exactly one diagramming technique and topology, namely the bipartite graph. The simplicity of its basic user interface easily enabled extensive tool support over the years, particularly in the areas of model checking, graphically oriented simulation, and software verification.
* Southbeach Notation is a visual modeling language used to describe situations in terms of agents that are considered useful or harmful from the modeler&#x27;s perspective. The notation shows how the agents interact with each other and whether this interaction improves or worsens the situation.
* Specification and Description Language (SDL) is a specification language targeted at the unambiguous specification and description of the behavior of reactive and distributed systems.
* SysML is a Domain-Specific Modeling language for systems engineering that is defined as a UML profile (customization).
* Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose modeling language that is an industry standard for specifying software-intensive systems. UML 2.0, the current version, supports thirteen different diagram techniques, and has widespread tool support.
* FLINT — language which allows a high-level description of normative systems.
* Service-oriented modeling framework (SOMF) is a holistic language for designing enterprise and application level architecture models in the space of enterprise architecture, virtualization, service-oriented architecture (SOA), cloud computing, and more.
* Architecture description language (ADL) is a language used to describe and represent the systems architecture of a system.
* Architecture Analysis &amp; Design Language (AADL) is a modeling language that supports early and repeated analyses of a system&#x27;s architecture with respect to performance-critical properties through an extendable notation, a tool framework, and precisely defined semantics.

Examples of graphical modeling languages in other fields of science.
* EAST-ADL is a Domain-Specific Modeling language dedicated to automotive system design.
* Energy Systems Language (ESL), a language that aims to model ecological energetics &amp; global economics.
*IEC 61499 defines Domain-Specific Modeling language dedicated to distribute industrial process measurement and control systems.

=== Textual types ===
Information models can also be expressed in formalized natural languages, such as Gellish. Gellish has natural language variants such as Gellish Formal English and Gellish Formal Dutch (Gellish Formeel Nederlands), etc. Gellish Formal English is an information representation language or semantic modeling language that is defined in the Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy, which has the form of a Taxonomy-Ontology (similarly for Dutch). Gellish Formal English is not only suitable to express knowledge, requirements and dictionaries, taxonomies and ontologies, but also information about individual things. All that information is expressed in one language and therefore it can all be integrated, independent of the question whether it is stored in central or distributed or in federated databases. Information models in Gellish Formal English consists of collections of Gellish Formal English expressions, that use natural language terms and formalized phrases. For example, a geographic information model might consist of a number of Gellish Formal English expressions, such as:

 - the Eiffel tower &lt;is located in&gt; Paris
 - Paris &lt;is classified as a&gt; city

whereas information requirements and knowledge can be expressed for example as follows:

 - tower &lt;shall be located in a&gt; geographical area
 - city &lt;is a kind of&gt; geographical area

Such Gellish Formal English expressions use names of concepts (such as &quot;city&quot;) and phrases that represent relation types (such as and ) that should be selected from the Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy (or of your own domain dictionary). The Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy enables the creation of semantically rich information models, because the dictionary contains more than 600 standard relation types and contains definitions of more than 40000 concepts. An information model in Gellish can express facts or make statements, queries and answers.

=== More specific types ===
In the field of computer science recently more specific types of modeling languages have emerged.

==== Algebraic ====
Algebraic Modeling Languages (AML) are high-level programming languages for describing and solving high complexity problems for large scale mathematical computation (i.e. large scale optimization type problems). One particular advantage of AMLs like AIMMS, AMPL, GAMS, Gekko, Mosel, OPL, MiniZinc, and OptimJ is the similarity of its syntax to the mathematical notation of optimization problems. This allows for a very concise and readable definition of problems in the domain of optimization, which is supported by certain language elements like sets, indices, algebraic expressions, powerful sparse index and data handling variables, constraints with arbitrary names. The algebraic formulation of a model does not contain any hints how to process it.

==== Behavioral ====

Behavioral languages are designed to describe the observable behavior of complex systems consisting of components that
execute concurrently. These languages focus on the description of key concepts such as: concurrency, nondeterminism, synchronization, and communication. The semantic foundations of Behavioral languages are process calculus or process algebra.

==== Discipline-specific ====
A discipline-specific modeling (DspM) language is focused on deliverables affiliated with a specific software development life cycle stage. Therefore, such language offers a distinct vocabulary, syntax, and notation for each stage, such as discovery, analysis, design, architecture, contraction, etc. For example, for the analysis phase of a project, the modeler employs specific analysis notation to deliver an analysis proposition diagram. During the design phase, however, logical design notation is used to depict the relationship between software entities. In addition, the discipline-specific modeling language best practices does not preclude practitioners from combining the various notations in a single diagram.

==== Domain-specific ====
Domain-specific modeling (DSM) is a software engineering methodology for designing and developing systems, most often IT systems such as computer software. It involves the systematic use of a graphical domain-specific language (DSL) to represent the various facets of a system. DSM languages tend to support higher-level abstractions than General-purpose modeling languages, so they require less effort and fewer low-level details to specify a given system.

==== Framework-specific ====
A framework-specific modeling language (FSML) is a kind of domain-specific modeling language which is designed for an object-oriented application framework. FSMLs define framework-provided abstractions as FSML concepts and decompose the abstractions into features. The features represent implementation steps or choices.

A FSML concept can be configured by selecting features and providing values for features. Such a concept configuration represents how the concept should be implemented in the code. In other words, concept configuration describes how the framework should be completed in order to create the implementation of the concept.

==== Information and knowledge modeling ====
Linked data and ontology engineering require &#x27;host languages&#x27; to represent entities and the relations between them, constraints between the properties of entities and relations, and metadata attributes. JSON-LD and RDF are two major (and semantically almost equivalent) languages in this context, primarily because they support statement reification and contextualisation which are essential properties to support the higher-order logic needed to reason about models. Model transformation is a common example of such reasoning.

==== Object-oriented ====
Object modeling languages are modeling languages based on a standardized set of symbols and ways of arranging them to model (part of) an object oriented software design or system design.

Some organizations use them extensively in combination with a software development methodology to progress from initial specification to an implementation plan and to communicate that plan to an entire team of developers and stakeholders. Because a modeling language is visual and at a higher-level of abstraction than code, using models encourages the generation of a shared vision that may prevent problems of differing interpretation later in development. Often software modeling tools are used to construct these models, which may then be capable of automatic translation to code.

==== Virtual reality ====
Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), before 1995 known as the Virtual Reality Markup Language is a standard file format for representing 3-dimensional (3D) interactive vector graphics, designed particularly with the World Wide Web in mind.

==== Others ====
* Architecture Description Language
* Face Modeling Language
* Generative Modelling Language
* Java Modeling Language
* Promela
* Rebeca Modeling Language
* Service Modeling Language
* Web Services Modeling Language
* X3D

== Applications ==
Various kinds of modeling languages are applied in different disciplines, including computer science, information management, business process modeling, software engineering, and systems engineering. Modeling languages can be used to specify:
* system requirements,
* structures and
* behaviors.
Modeling languages are intended to be used to precisely specify systems so that stakeholders (e.g., customers, operators, analysts, designers) can better understand the system being modeled.

The more mature modeling languages are precise, consistent and executable. Informal diagramming techniques applied with drawing tools are expected to produce useful pictorial representations of system requirements, structures and behaviors, which can be useful for communication, design, and problem solving but cannot be used programmatically. Executable modeling languages applied with proper tool support, however, are expected to automate system verification and validation, simulation and code generation from the same representations.

== Quality ==
A review of modelling languages is essential to be able to assign which languages are appropriate for different modelling settings. In the term settings we include stakeholders, domain and the knowledge connected. Assessing the language quality is a means that aims to achieve better models.

=== Framework for evaluation ===
Here language quality is stated in accordance with the SEQUAL framework for quality of models developed by Krogstie, Sindre and Lindland (2003), since this is a framework that connects the language quality to a framework for general model quality. Five areas are used in this framework to describe language quality and these are supposed to express both the as well as the visual notation of the language. We will not go into a thorough explanation of the underlying quality framework of models but concentrate on the areas used to explain the language quality framework.

==== Domain appropriateness ====
The framework states the ability to represent the domain as domain appropriateness. The statement &quot;appropriateness&quot; can be a bit vague, but in this particular context it means &quot;able to express&quot;. You should ideally only be able to express things that are in the domain but be powerful enough to include everything that is in the domain. This requirement might seem a bit strict, but the aim is to get a visually expressed model which includes everything relevant to the domain and excludes everything not appropriate for the domain. To achieve this, the language has to have a good distinction of which notations and syntaxes that are advantageous to present.

==== Participant appropriateness ====
To evaluate the participant appropriateness we try to identify how well the language expresses the knowledge held by the stakeholders. This involves challenges since a stakeholder&#x27;s knowledge is subjective. The knowledge of the stakeholder is both tacit and explicit. Both types of knowledge are of dynamic character. In this framework only the explicit type of knowledge is taken into account. The language should to a large extent express all the explicit knowledge of the stakeholders relevant to the domain.

==== Modeller appropriateness ====
Last paragraph stated that knowledge of the stakeholders should be presented in a good way. In addition it is imperative that the language should be able to express all possible explicit knowledge of the stakeholders. No knowledge should be left unexpressed due to lacks in the language.

==== Comprehensibility appropriateness ====
Comprehensibility appropriateness makes sure that the social actors understand the model due to a consistent use of the language. To achieve this the framework includes a set of criteria. The general importance that these express is that the language should be flexible, easy to organize and easy to distinguish different parts of the language internally as well as from other languages. In addition to this, the goal should be as simple as possible and that each symbol in the language has a unique representation.

This is in connection to also to the structure of the development requirements. 

==== Tool appropriateness ====
To ensure that the domain actually modelled is usable for analyzing and further processing, the language has to ensure that it is possible to reason in an automatic way. To achieve this it has to include formal syntax and semantics. Another advantage by formalizing is the ability to discover errors in an early stage. It is not always that the language best fitted for the technical actors is the same as for the social actors.

==== Organizational appropriateness ====
The language used is appropriate for the organizational context, e.g. that the language is standardized within the organization, or that it is supported by tools that are chosen as standard in the organization.

<doc id="346782" wikidata="Q7187782" url="?curid=346782" title="Photographic quantity">
<text>Photographic quantity (also known as photoquantity) is a measure of the amount of light received by a sensor, such as a camera, in dimensionless units that account for information lost by integration over the spectral response of the sensor, while otherwise preserving the linear relationship involved in the interaction of light through one or more exposures. The photoquantity is neither radiometric nor photometric. The photoquantity is not radiometric because the sensor, camera, or the like, is not an ideal receiving antenna. Rather, the sensor has some non-flat spectral response. The photoquantity is not photometric, because the sensor&#x27;s spectral response does not necessarily match the spectral response of the human eye.

Photoquantities are often involved in the solutions to comparametric equations, appear in research papers dealing with image processing, and are also used in the production of visual art made from multiple differently illuminated pictures of the same subject matter.
