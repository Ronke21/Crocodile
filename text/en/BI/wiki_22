<text>New Zealand First (), commonly abbreviated to NZ First or NZF, is a political party in New Zealand, founded and led by Winston Peters, who has served three times as deputy prime minister. The party has formed coalition governments with both major political parties in New Zealand: with the New Zealand National Party from 1996 to 1998 and 2023 to present, and with the New Zealand Labour Party from 2005 to 2008 and 2017 to 2020. New Zealand First currently serves in a coalition government with both National and ACT New Zealand as part of the Sixth National government, having won 6.08% of the total party vote in the 2023 New Zealand general election. 

New Zealand First was formed shortly before the 1993 New Zealand general election, following the resignation of Winston Peters as the National Party MP for Tauranga after criticising the party&#x27;s neoliberal economic policies. The party gained support from National Party and Labour voters alike disenchanted with the support of both parties for extensive deregulation. New Zealand First entered the New Zealand House of Representatives shortly after its formation. The party had 17 members of parliament (MPs) at its peak, following the 1996 New Zealand general election, the first to use mixed-member proportional representation. That election the party swept the Māori seats, leading to the &quot;Tight Five&quot; of New Zealand First MPs from those electorates. The party had gained considerable support among socially conservative Māori voters, an association still visible today. By the end of their first term, however, the New Zealand First caucus had fallen to 9 MPs due to internal conflict over the coalition government with the National Party. 

After agreeing a confidence and supply with Labour in 2005, the party left parliament following the 2008 New Zealand general election in which it failed to gain enough party votes to retain seats. However, in the 2011 New Zealand general election, New Zealand First gained 6.59% of the total party vote, entitling it to eight MPs. The party increased its number of MPs to eleven at the 2014 New Zealand general election. During the 2017 election, the party&#x27;s number of MPs dropped to nine members. In the weeks following the 2017 election, New Zealand First formed a coalition government with the Labour Party. In the 2020 election New Zealand First&#x27;s share of the party vote fell to 2.6%, with all incumbent MPs, including Peters, losing their seats in Parliament. The party returned to parliament in 2023.

New Zealand First distinguishes itself from the mainstream political establishment through its use of populist rhetoric, and supports binding referendums on major social and political issues.

==History==
===Foundation===

In June 1992, Winston Peters, a former Minister of Māori Affairs in the National Party government of Jim Bolger, was told that he would not be allowed to run for another term as National Party Member of Parliament for Tauranga in the 1993 election. Peters had previously been dismissed from the Cabinet in 1991, after he publicly criticised National&#x27;s economic policy, colloquially dubbed Ruthanasia. Spearheaded by Minister of Finance Ruth Richardson, National arguably had gone beyond the extensive deregulation started by the New Zealand Labour Party in the 1980s, enacting widespread austerity and slashing benefits in the Mother of All Budgets of 1991. The budget cut spending on many of the welfare state institutions established in the 1930s by the First Labour Government. The unemployment benefit was cut by $14.00 a week, sickness benefit by $27.04, families benefit by $25.00 to $27.00 and universal payments for family benefits were completely abolished. After the death of protectionist former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon – who resigned from his Tamaki constituency in protest – Peters became Ruthanasia&#x27;s leading opponents, and National&#x27;s most prominent dissenter.

By late 1991, the National Party had become the most unpopular governing party since the Great Depression, with one poll result putting them as low as 22%. After his sacking, Peters decided to capitalise on National&#x27;s unpopularity. On 19 March 1993, Peters resigned from the National Party. He also resigned from Parliament, triggering a by-election in his electorate on 17 April 1993 in which he stood as an independent, winning with 90.8% of votes due to neither Labour nor National running a candidate. On 18 July 1993, shortly before the writs were issued for that year&#x27;s general election, Peters formed New Zealand First as a political grouping. At the time of its formation, New Zealand First&#x27;s policy platform was broadly conservative and reactionary in that it opposed both Labour and National, the major centre-left and centre-right parties respectively. Peters claimed to be reviving National policies from which the Bolger government had departed.

Variably dubbed a social conservative, economic nationalist, or right-wing populist, Peters&#x27; rise was fueled by the enormous financial changes New Zealand underwent during the 1980s and 90s, during which time the economy was thoroughly deregulated by both the Labour Party and the National Party. A fierce opponent of both neoliberalism and progressivism, Peters gained support from both National Party and Labour voters disenchanted with the support of both parties for economic liberalisation. As Peters was a Māori conservative, he gained strong support particularly from socially conservative Māori voters who had voted Labour consistently until they began enforcing neoliberal policies, colloquially called Rogernomics. The party was soon widely regarded as having a distinct Māori character or even being &quot;pro-Māori&quot;.

===1993 general election===

In the April 1993 special by-election, Tauranga voters re-elected Peters as an independent. At the general election six months later, New Zealand First received 8.4% of the total vote. Peters easily retained Tauranga, and Tau Henare, another New Zealand First candidate, won the Northern Māori seat, giving the party a total of two MPs. This did much to counter the perception of New Zealand First as merely a personality-driven vehicle for Peters.

===1996 general election===
With the switch to the mixed-member proportional (MMP) electoral system for the 1996 election, smaller parties could gain a share of seats proportional to their share of the vote. Before the election, New Zealand First was polling unprecedentedly highly due to the popularity of its leader, Winston Peters. At its peak, New Zealand First was polling at 29% support on 16 May 1996.

This enabled New Zealand First to win 13% of the vote and 17 seats, including all five Māori electorates. New Zealand First&#x27;s five Māori MPs—Tau Henare (the party&#x27;s deputy leader), Tuku Morgan, Rana Waitai, Tu Wyllie and Tuariki Delamere—became known as the &quot;Tight Five&quot;.

The election result put New Zealand First in a powerful position just three years after its formation. Neither of the two traditional major parties (National and Labour) had enough seats to govern alone, and only New Zealand First had enough seats to become a realistic coalition partner for either. This placed the relatively new party in a position where it was the kingmaker, a position which allowed the party to effectively choose the next Prime Minister of New Zealand.

New Zealand First entered into negotiations with both major parties. Before the election, most people (including many New Zealand First voters) had expected Peters to enter into coalition with Labour. In fact, he harshly attacked his former National colleagues during the campaign, and appeared to promise that he would not even consider going into coalition with them.

===Coalition with National: 1996–1998===
To the surprise of the electorate, which had apparently voted for New Zealand First to get rid of National, New Zealand First decided to enter a coalition &quot;with&quot; National, enabling and becoming part of the third term of the fourth National government. The most common explanation for this decision involved National&#x27;s willingness to accept New Zealand First&#x27;s demands (and/or Labour&#x27;s refusal to do so). However, Michael Laws (a former National Party MP who served as a New Zealand First campaign manager) claims that Peters had secretly decided to go with National significantly before this time, and that he merely used negotiations with Labour to encourage more concessions from National.

Whatever the case, New Zealand First exacted a high price from Bolger in return for allowing him to stay in power. Under the terms of a detailed coalition agreement, Peters would serve as Deputy Prime Minister, and would also hold the specially created office of Treasurer (senior to the Minister of Finance). National also made considerable concessions on policy. Unusually for a junior coalition partner in a Westminster system (especially one as new as New Zealand First), Peters was free to select the ministers from his own party, without Bolger&#x27;s oversight.

New Zealand First had a relatively smooth coalition relationship with National at first. Despite early concerns about the ability of Peters to work with Bolger, who had sacked him from cabinet during his time as Minister of Māori Affairs in 1991, the two did not have major problems. New Zealand First had graver concerns about the behaviour of some of its MPs. A particularly damaging scandal involved Tuku Morgan, which consisted of him allegedly spending $4000 in public funds on clothing, though the Serious Fraud Office later did not find him guilty of fraud.

Gradually, however, the coalition tensions became more significant than problems of party discipline. This became increasingly the case after Transport Minister Jenny Shipley gained enough support within the National party room to force Bolger&#x27;s resignation and to subsequently become New Zealand&#x27;s first woman Prime Minister on 8 December 1997. The tensions between the two parties also rose as New Zealand First adopted a more aggressive approach to promoting its policies (including those National would not implement). This new attitude probably fed off New Zealand First&#x27;s poor performance in opinion polls, which (to Peters) indicated that the party&#x27;s success rested on its confrontational style. Many commentators believe that Peters performs better in opposition than in government.

===Return to opposition===
On 14 August 1998, Shipley sacked Peters from Cabinet. This occurred after an ongoing dispute about the sale of the government&#x27;s stake in Wellington International Airport, directly in conflict with New Zealand First&#x27;s general commitment to not sell off state assets.

Peters immediately tore up the coalition agreement. However, several other MPs, unwilling to follow Peters into opposition and wanting to continue to support a National-led government, tried to replace Peters as Leader of New Zealand First with Tau Henare, the then-Deputy Leader. This caucus-room coup failed, and Henare eventually led four other New Zealand First MPs in forming a new party, Mauri Pacific, which was a self-proclaimed multicultural party. Three others established themselves as independents. All eight departing MPs continued to support a National-led minority government. Many of these MPs had come under public scrutiny for their behaviour. Until the dissolution of Parliament in 1999, they provided Shipley with enough parliamentary support to stay in government without New Zealand First.

===1999 general election===
In the 1999 election New Zealand First lost much of its support, receiving only 4% of the party vote. Some voters had not forgiven Peters for forming a coalition with National after being led to believe that a vote for him would help get rid of National, and others likely changed their vote due to the instability within the party&#x27;s ranks. Whatever the case, New Zealand First&#x27;s support tailed off enough that it was nearly ejected from parliament. Under New Zealand&#x27;s MMP system, a party must either win an electorate seat or 5% of the vote to qualify for list seats. Peters held his Tauranga electorate by a mere 63 votes after losing almost 20 percent of his vote from 1996, and New Zealand First received five seats in total.

===2002 general election===
By the 2002 New Zealand general election, however, the party had rebuilt much of its support. This occurred largely because of Peters&#x27; three-point campaign for sensible immigration, scrutinising Treaty costs, and reducing crime. The party won 10.38% of the vote, which was a considerable improvement on its previous performance (although not as good as its performance in 1996), and New Zealand First won thirteen seats in parliament. Peters&#x27; campaign slogan &quot;Can We Fix It? Yes We Can&quot; attracted much media attention, as the same line appears in theme music for the children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Bob the Builder&quot;. Party activists stated they were unaware the chant came from a children&#x27;s cartoon. In the end, New Zealand First gained 8 seats in Parliament after the election, earning 13 MPs in total (including 1 electorate MP): Winston Peters, Peter Brown, Brian Donnelly, Ron Mark, Doug Woolerton, Barbara Stewart, Pita Paraone, Craig McNair, Jim Peters, Dail Jones, Edwin Perry, Bill Gudgeon, and Brent Catchpole. 

It appears that New Zealand First had hoped to play in 2002 a similar role to the one it had in 1996, where it found itself able to give power to either Labour or National depending on which offered the best deal. However, National&#x27;s support, under the leadership of future Prime Minister Bill English, had collapsed to its worst result in the party&#x27;s history, to the extent that it could not form a government even with New Zealand First&#x27;s support, depriving the party of its hoped kingmaker position. In the end, however, this proved irrelevant, as Labour refused to consider an alliance with New Zealand First in any case. Instead, Labour relied on support from the newly significant United Future.

After the 2002 election, in light of National&#x27;s decreased strength, New Zealand First attempted to gain more prominence in Opposition, frequently attacking the Labour-led Coalition government on a wide range of issues. Speculation has occurred on efforts to create a more united front linking New Zealand First, the New Zealand National Party, and ACT New Zealand, but Peters has rejected this scenario, saying that the New Zealand voters will decide what alliances are necessary. Unlike the classical-liberal ACT New Zealand, which portrays itself as a natural coalition partner for the New Zealand National Party, New Zealand First welcomed the potential for a coalition government with any parliamentary political party.

For a period in early 2004 New Zealand First experienced a brief decline in the polls after Don Brash became leader of the National Party, a change which hugely revived National&#x27;s fortunes after the controversial but highly popular Orewa Speech. The votes that had apparently switched to New Zealand First from National seemed to return to support Don Brash, and many commentators predicted that New Zealand First would lose a number of its seats in the next election. By 2005, however, the proportions had changed again, and as the campaign for the September 2005 election got under way, New Zealand First had again reached the 10% mark in opinion polling for the 2005 election.

Pre-election polls put New Zealand First ahead of the other minor parties. Some thought it likely that in the event of a National minority or plurality, unless ACT&#x27;s fortunes dramatically improved, Don Brash would have to form a second coalition or seek a support agreement with New Zealand First to be able to form a government. Peters promised to support the party that won the most seats, or at least abstain in no-confidence motions against it. However, he also said he would not support any government that included the Greens within Cabinet.

===Confidence and supply with Labour: 2005–2008===
In the 2005 election, however, the smaller political parties (including New Zealand First) suffered a severe mauling. Though it remained the third-largest party in the House, New Zealand First took only 5.72% of the vote, a considerable loss from 2002, and just enough to cross the MMP proportionality quota of 5%. In addition, Peters narrowly lost his previously safe constituency seat of Tauranga by 730 votes to National&#x27;s Bob Clarkson, and became a list MP. New Zealand First lost six seats in Parliament, earning 7 MPs, all elected on the party list: Winston Peters, Peter Brown, Dail Jones, Ron Mark, Doug Woolerton, Barbara Stewart and Pita Paraone.

Following the 2005 election, New Zealand First agreed to a supply-and-confidence agreement with the New Zealand Labour Party (along with United Future) in return for policy concessions including the SuperGold Card and the portfolio of Foreign Affairs outside Cabinet for Winston Peters. Peters becoming Minister of Foreign Affairs detected a change in his attitude since Peters&#x27; &quot;Rotorua speech&quot; on 7 September 2005 at a public address at the Rotorua Convention Centre had spoken of New Zealand First sitting on the cross-benches (and thus staying out of government) and eschewing &quot;the baubles of office&quot;. Peters&#x27; coalition partnership with the centre-left Labour Party was in spite of his increasingly right-wing populist rhetoric around emigration from Asia (which was at odds with Labour&#x27;s policies). Peters has previously warned of an &quot;Asian invasion&quot; of Asian migrants (against the evidence suggested by statistical trends). In 2005 he called New Zealand &quot;the last Asian colony&quot;, and referred to Asian immigration as an “imported criminal activity” that would cause &quot;chaos&quot; to race relations.

Soon after the 2005 New Zealand general election, Winston Peters launched a legal challenge against Bob Clarkson, alleging that he had spent more than the legal limit allowed for campaign budgets during elections in New Zealand. This legal bid failed, with a majority of the judges in the case declaring that Bob Clarkson had not overspent during the campaign for the Tauranga electorate. In the 2005 election funding controversy, the Auditor-General found that all the parties in parliament except the Progressive Party had misspent parliamentary funding. New Zealand First was the only party that did not repay the misspent funding. 

New Zealand First achieved many policy initiatives during this term, most notably the introduction of the SuperGold Card, a policy which was unpopular among many political leaders due to its high cost. The SuperGold Card was targeted towards seniors, and included free off-peak travel, and discounts from thousands of New Zealand businesses. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister for Racing and Associate Minister for Senior Citizens, Peters secured additional funding for &quot;New Zealand to expand its international presence&quot; in the 2007 budget, as well as in the 2008 budget additional benefits for SuperGold Card holders including funding for hearing aids, investments into the Pacific Cooperation Foundation and Asia-New Zealand Foundation, additional funding for prize money in the racing industry totalling $9m, and a large funding increase for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade once again.

As Minister of Foreign Affairs, Winston Peters&#x27; most notable actions included a diplomatic mission to Papua New Guinea and meeting with United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

===2008 general election===
In the months before the 2008 general election, New Zealand First became embroiled in a dispute over donations to the party from billionaire Owen Glenn, the Vela family and Bob Jones. This resulted in an investigation into party finances by the Serious Fraud Office on the 28th of August 2008 and an investigation into Peters by the Privileges Committee. On 29 August 2008 Peters stood down from his ministerial roles after significant pressure, while the investigations by the Serious Fraud Office and Privileges Committee proceeded. Although the Serious Fraud Office and the police found that Peters was not guilty of any wrongdoing, the Privileges Committee decided that Peters knowingly misled Parliament by not declaring the donation, and censured Peters, which he called a &quot;useless facade.&quot; The whole scandal harmed New Zealand First&#x27;s polling in the lead-up to the election, and is widely attributed to its defeat.

During the scandal, then Leader of the Opposition John Key took the opportunity to rule out working with Peters and New Zealand First, which likely contributed further to the party&#x27;s defeat. As expected, Prime Minister Helen Clark did not rule out working with New Zealand First.

On election night it was clear that Peters had not regained Tauranga after his last loss of the electorate in the 2005 election, and that the party had not met the 5% threshold needed for parties to be elected without an electorate seat. In what some journalists described as a &#x27;gracious&#x27; concession speech, Peters said that &#x27;it&#x27;s not over yet. We&#x27;ll reorganise ourselves in the next few months. And we&#x27;ll see what 2011 might hold for all us.&quot;

At a post-election meeting held to discuss the party&#x27;s future in February 2009, long-serving Deputy Leader Peter Brown stepped down.

===2011 general election===
At the beginning of the election campaign New Zealand First was polling at around 2% in most major polls and was effectively written off by most political commentators. Prime Minister John Key had once again ruled out working with Peters and New Zealand First, however then Leader of the Opposition Phil Goff had stated he was open to working with New Zealand First post-election provided they made it back into Parliament.

Peters received a significant amount of media attention towards the end of the campaign at the height of the Tea Tape scandal which arose during the campaign. Peters had criticised the arrangement in the seat of Epsom between National and ACT in which National encouraged its supporters to vote for the ACT candidate for their electorate MP. He railed against National for alleged negative remarks made about the then ACT leader Don Brash and New Zealand First&#x27;s elderly supporters.

Peters appeared on a TVNZ minor parties leaders debate and won the debate convincingly in the subsequent text poll, with a plurality of 36% of the respondents saying Peters had won.

New Zealand First won 6.6% of the party vote on election night. Many political experts credit the Tea Tape Scandal for the re-entry of New Zealand First into Parliament; however, Peters himself credits the return to Parliament to the hard work undertaken by the Party over the three years it was not represented in Parliament.

In 2012 the party sacked MP Brendan Horan after allegations he stole money from his dying mother to gamble.

===2014 general election===

In 2012, New Zealand First stated their intent to work in coalition with parties that would buy the privatised state assets back after the 2014 general election.

New Zealand First entered the 2014 general election campaign without providing a clear indication as to their coalition preferences. However, Peters did raise late in the campaign the prospect of a Labour-New Zealand First coalition or confidence and supply arrangement, and express some respect for the National Party, in particular the Finance Minister Bill English.

New Zealand First increased its party vote to 8.66% at the election, which took the party&#x27;s representation in Parliament to 11 seats. Peters was highly critical of the conduct of the Labour and Green parties, who he blamed for the Opposition&#x27;s loss.

In 2015 Peters contested the Northland by-election, which was held as a result of the resignation of the incumbent Mike Sabin on 30 January 2015 amid allegations of assault. Peters won the traditionally safe National seat with a majority of 4,441 over the National candidate Mark Osborne. It was the first time a New Zealand First MP held an electorate seat since Peters lost Tauranga in 2005. The win also resulted in New Zealand First acquiring a new List MP, Ria Bond, which increased the party&#x27;s parliamentary representation to 12 seats.

On 3 July 2015 Ron Mark was elected Deputy Leader of New Zealand First, replacing Tracey Martin who had held the post since 2013.

===2017 general election===

Peters has said that he will continue on as the Leader of New Zealand First. New Zealand First launched its campaign in Palmerston North on 25 June 2017. Policies include ring-fencing GST to the regions it is collected from and writing off student loans of people willing to work outside major centres, and recruiting 1,800 extra police officers. New Zealand First is also campaigning on increasing the minimum wage to $17. They would later increase it to $20. On 28 June 2017, New Zealand First changed their logo that they have used since its formation in 1993, giving the new design the name &quot;A Fresh Face&quot;.

In early July 2017, the Green Party co-leader Metiria Turei criticised New Zealand First for its alleged racist attitude towards immigration. Her criticism was echoed by fellow Green MP Barry Coates, who claimed that the Greens would call for a snap election in response to a Labour–New Zealand First coalition government. In response, Peters and Deputy Leader Tracey Martin warned that Turei and Coates&#x27; comments could affect post-election negotiations between the two parties. Though Turei did not apologise for her remarks, Greens co-leader James Shaw later clarified that Coates&#x27; statement did not represent official Green Party policy.

During the party&#x27;s convention in South Auckland on 16 July, Peters vowed that a New Zealand First government would hold two binding referendums on whether Maori electorates should be abolished and whether the number of MPs should be reduced to 100. Other New Zealand First policies included reducing immigration to 10,000 a year (from 72,300 in the June 2017 year), and bringing the country&#x27;s banks back into Kiwi ownership, starting with making Kiwibank the New Zealand government&#x27;s official trading bank.

During the 2017 general election, New Zealand First&#x27;s share of the vote dropped to 7.2% with the party&#x27;s representation in Parliament being reduced to 9 MPs. Under Peters&#x27; leadership, New Zealand First entered into talks to form coalitions with the National Party and the Labour Party. National Party leader and caretaker Prime Minister Bill English signalled an interest in forming a coalition with New Zealand First, while Labour leader Jacinda Ardern considered a three-way coalition with New Zealand First and the Greens. Peters stated that he would not make his final decision until the special votes results were released on 7 October 2017. During negotiations with Ardern, Peters indicated that he would be willing to consider dropping his call for a referendum on abolishing the Māori electorates in return for forming a coalition with Labour; a bone of contention in New Zealand race relations.

===Coalition with Labour: 2017–2020===

On 19 October, Labour and New Zealand First decided to form a coalition government and a confidence and supply agreement with the Green Party. On 26 October, Peters was appointed Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister for State-owned enterprises, and Minister for Racing. Deputy Leader Ron Mark was given the Minister of Defence and Veterans portfolios. Tracey Martin was given the Children, Internal Affairs, and Senior Citizens portfolios as well as being made Associate Minister of Education. Shane Jones was made Minister of Forestry, Infrastructure, Regional Economic Development, and Associate Minister of Finance and Transport.

During the post-election negotiations, New Zealand First managed to secure several policies and concessions including a Regional Development Fund, the re-establishment of the New Zealand Forest Service, increasing the minimum wage to $20 per hour by 2020, a comprehensive register of foreign-owned land and housing, free doctors&#x27; visits for all under-14-year-olds, free driver training for all secondary students, a new generation SuperGold smartcard containing entitlements and concessions, a royalty on the exports of bottled water, a commitment to re-entry of the Pike River Mine, and Members of Parliament being allowed to vote in a potential referendum on euthanasia. In return, New Zealand First agreed to drop its demand for referendums on overturning New Zealand&#x27;s anti-smacking ban and abolishing the Māori electorates.

In 2019, New Zealand First&#x27;s Internal Affairs minister, Tracey Martin participated in negotiations with the Labour Party to pass the Abortion Legislation Bill to reform the country&#x27;s abortion laws. While Martin had ruled out supporting a referendum, she was overruled by the party leader Peters who demanded a binding referendum on the proposed legislation. He also ruled out giving New Zealand First MPs a conscience vote on the issue. While the party would support the bill at first reading, Peters warned that they would withdraw support if the proposed law was not put to a public referendum. In response, Justice Minister Andrew Little rebuffed Peters&#x27; demands for a referendum on the grounds that Parliament would decide the legislation. In March 2020, seven of the 9 NZ First MPs voted against the Bill while the two female MPs voted in favour of the Bill at its final reading—Tracey Martin and Jenny Marcroft.

In late 2019, New Zealand First won a parliamentary vote to hold a euthanasia referendum, as the party threatened to vote down the legislation if it did not go to a referendum. The decision to go to a referendum passed 63–57.

===2020 general election===
During the 2020 New Zealand general election, New Zealand First&#x27;s party vote dropped to 75,021 (2.6%), causing the party to lose all of its seats in Parliament since it fell below the five percent threshold needed to enter Parliament through the party list alone. All NZ First MPs also lost the seats they were contesting. Two months after the election, both its president and secretary resigned. Former MP Darroch Ball became interim president; he claimed that the resignations were &quot;always a planned retirement after the election for both roles&quot;.

===Out of Parliament: 2020–2023===
On 20 June 2021, Winston Peters confirmed that he would continue leading the party for the 2023 general election. Peters also made a speech attacking the Labour, National and Green parties that touched upon various issues including transportation infrastructure in Auckland, the increasing use of the Māori language in official reports and public life, the Government&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccination rollout, purchase of Ihumātao land, elimination of referendums on Māori wards and constituencies, and so-called wokeness in New Zealand society. This speech marked his first major public appearance since the 2020 general election.

===New Zealand First Foundation fraud case: 2020–2022===

In mid-February 2020, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) announced that it was investigating the NZ First Foundation in response to allegations that the party had created a slush fund. Between 2017 and 2019, New Zealand First officials had allegedly channelled half a million dollars of donations into the NZ First Foundation&#x27;s bank account to cover various party-related expenses such as the party&#x27;s headquarters, graphic design, an MP&#x27;s legal advice, and even a $5000 day at the Wellington races. The amount of donations deposited into the foundation and used by the party was at odds with its official annual returns. Peters has denied any wrongdoing, while fellow MP Shane Jones, the Minister for Infrastructure, has denounced allegations that the party was offering policy for cash as &quot;conspiracy theories.&quot;

In late September 2020, the Serious Fraud Office announced that they would be laying charges against two persons as a result of their investigation into the NZ First Foundation.

On 7 June 2022, the trial of two men charged with stealing NZ$746,881 worth of donations from New Zealand First between September 2015 and February 2020 began. At the time, the defendants had been granted name suppression. Prosecutor Paul Wicks QC argued that the defendants had deceived about 40 donors, the NZ First party secretary and the Electoral Commission into believing that their donations were going to the party. In fact, the money had gone into one of the defendants&#x27; bank accounts and the NZ First Foundation&#x27;s bank account. Under the Electoral Act, funds donated to the NZ First Foundation between 2017 and 2020 should have been treated as party donations. According to the prosecution, the NZ First Foundation&#x27;s funds were being used as a &quot;slush fund&quot; to cover party expenses including leasing and furnishing office space for the party&#x27;s Wellington headquarters, election campaigning, and fundraisers. Wicks claimed that the defendants rather than the party&#x27;s leadership controlled these funds.

On 23 June, the Crown concluded its closing arguments against the defendants. The defence concluded its closing arguments on 27 June. On 20 July, High Court Justice Pheroze Jagose permanently suppressed the names of the two defendants in the NZ First Foundation fraud case. On 22 July, the two defendants were acquitted by Justice Jagose.

In response to the NZ First Foundation trial verdict, Justice Minister Kiri Allan announced that the Government would be introducing new electoral donation amendment bill to widen the definition of political donations to include those donated to third-party entities and making it an offence not to pass political donations to a party&#x27;s secretary. Other proposed measures include lowering the donation disclosure threshold from NZ$15,000 to NZ$5,000.

===2023 general election===
Before the 2023 New Zealand general election, Winston Peters said that NZ First would not join a coalition Government with Labour. In late March 2023, Peters announced that if elected into government, NZ First would remove Māori names from government departments and bring back English names. The party opposed raising the superannuation eligibility age from 65 to 67 years. It opposed vaccine mandates and proposed that gang affiliation should automatically serve as an aggravating factor in crime sentencing.

On 23 July, NZ First launched its election campaign with the slogan &quot;Take our country back.&quot; Peters announced that the party would campaign on five key issues: combating &quot;racist separatism,&quot; fighting Australian-owned banks and the &quot;supermarket duopoly,&quot; investing in health, social services, and elderly care, and adopting &quot;tough on crime&quot; policies including designating all gangs as terrorist organisations. On 30 July, NZ First campaigned on moving the Ports of Auckland and the Royal New Zealand Navy&#x27;s Devonport base to Northport, extending the North Island Main Trunk Line to Marsden Point, a new four-lane alternative highway through the Brynderwyn Range, and establishing a full inquiry into the Government&#x27;s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand.

On 13 August, Stuff reported that several NZ First candidates including property and commercial lawyer Kirsten Murfitt, Auckland consultant Janina Massee, Matamata-Piako district councillor Caleb Ansell, and Kevin Stone had expoused various controversial views including COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and &quot;plandemic&quot; conspiracy theories, New World Order conspiracy theories, climate skepticism, Qanon, and support for Uganda&#x27;s Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2023. In response, Peters stated that NZ First&#x27;s candidate list was provisional and defended the party&#x27;s candidate selection process. 

On 16 August, NZ First released its policies on transgender people on bathrooms and sports; which included introducing legislation requiring public bodies to have &quot;clearly demarcated&quot; unisex and single-sex toilets, restricting toilet access to individuals from the opposite sex, and requiring sporting bodies to have an &quot;exclusive biological female category.&quot; On 20 August, NZ First released a policy of promoting English to the status of an official language of New Zealand and withdrawing from the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People.

During the 2023 election, New Zealand First was returned to Parliament with 6.08% of the total party vote and eight list seats. 

===Coalition with National: 2023–present===
Following coalition talks, NZ First entered into a coalition agreement with the National and ACT parties. As part of the NZ First-National coalition agreement, National would no longer proceed with its proposed foreign buyer tax but would instead fund tax cuts via reprioritisation and other forms of revenue gathering. The new Government would also scrap the previous Labour Government&#x27;s fair pay agreements, proposed hate speech legislation, co-governance policies, Auckland light rail, Three Waters reform programme, and Māori Health Authority. In addition, fees-free tertiary education would be shifted from the first to last year of tertiary study.

The Government also agreed to adopt NZ First&#x27;s policy of establishing a NZ$1.2 billion Regional Infrastructure Fund, establishing English as an official language, and requiring government departments to use English for their primary names and communications, except for those dealing with Māori people. The Government also adopted NZ First&#x27;s policy of halting all work related to the He Puapua report and confirming that the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples has no legal basis in New Zealand law. The Government also agreed to restore the right to local referendum on the establishment or ongoing use of Māori wards. 

As part of the NZ First-National coalition agreement the Government also agreed to end all remaining COVID-19 vaccine mandates and to hold an independent inquiry into how the COVID-19 pandemic was handled in New Zealand. This proposed independent inquiry is expected to examine the use of multiple lockdowns, vaccine procurement and efficacy, social and economic impacts on both national and regional levels, and whether decisions and actions taken by the Government were justified. While the outgoing Labour Government had commissioned a Royal Commission of Inquiry into COVID-19 Lessons Learned, Peters claimed the inquiry&#x27;s terms of reference were &quot;too limited&quot; during election campaigning.

Within the National-led coalition government, Peters assumed the positions of Deputy Prime Minister (until 31 May 2025), Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Racing. Shane Jones became Minister for Oceans and Fisheries, Regional Development, and Resources. Casey Costello became Minister of Customs and Minister for Seniors. In addition, Mark Patterson became Minister for Rural Communities and Associate Minister of Agriculture while Jenny Marcroft became Under-Secretary to the Minister for Media and Communications.

On 10 May 2024, the party introduced its Fair Access to Bathrooms Bill into Parliament, which would require all public buildings to provide clearly demarcated, unisex and single sex bathrooms. The proposed bill would also fine anyone using a single-sex toilet &quot;who is not of the sex for which that toilet has been designated.&quot; In early July 2024, NZ First invoked its &quot;agree to disagree&quot; provision in its coalition agreement with National after the Government decided to allow the Royal Commission of Inquiry into COVID-19 Lessons Learned to complete its first phase and retain its chair Tony Blakely.

==Ideology and policies==

Historically in the 1990s and the 2000s the party was often labelled as simply populist. From the 2010s onwards the party has been referred to as right-wing populist. Over the years the party has also variously been described as nationalist centrist, conservative, socially conservative, centre-right, and right-wing. Conversely, academic Professor Todd Donovan argued in 2020 that &quot;radical right / right-wing populist&quot; is a misclassification of New Zealand First because it is neither radical nor right-wing.

New Zealand First takes a broadly centrist and interventionist position on economic issues and a socially conservative position on moral issues. The party distinguishes itself from the mainstream political establishment through its use of populist rhetoric, and supports binding referendums for major social and political change. The party is also anti-immigration and anti-globalisation, while also supportive of protectionism and pensioners&#x27; interests. The party&#x27;s support base is mostly composed of middle-aged to elderly, rural and Māori voters.

The party has long advocated direct democracy in the form of &quot;binding citizen initiated referenda&quot;, to create &quot;a democracy that is of the people and for the people&quot;, while forcing government &quot;to accept the will of the people&quot;. Peters has also used anti-establishment and anti-elite rhetoric, such as criticising what he regards as the &quot;intellectually arrogant elite in government and bureaucratic circles&quot;.

At the core of New Zealand First&#x27;s policies are its &quot;Fifteen Fundamental Principles&quot;; the first being &quot;To put New Zealand and New Zealanders First&quot;. They largely echo the policies that Winston Peters, the party&#x27;s founder, has advocated during his career. NZ First seeks to &quot;promote and protect the customs, traditions and values of all New Zealanders&quot;. Commentators have described the party, and Peters himself, as nationalist. Former party official and parliamentary researcher Josh Van Veen has characterised the party as culturally conservative due to its emphasis on preserving heritage and respect for national symbols. Van Veen opines that New Zealand First&#x27;s emphasis on an inclusive national identity has led to a marriage between liberal values and progressive nationalism.

===Social and economic policies===
New Zealand First has been closely associated with its policies regarding the welfare of senior citizens and its anti-immigration stance. The party has frequently criticised immigration on economic, social and cultural grounds. It proposes an annual immigration cap of between 7,000 and 15,000 &quot;seriously qualified&quot; migrants, who would be expected to assimilate into New Zealand culture.

Peters has on several occasions characterised the rate of Asian immigration into New Zealand as too high; in 2004, he stated: &quot;We are being dragged into the status of an Asian colony and it is time that New Zealanders were placed first in their own country&quot;. On 26 April 2005, he said: &quot;Māori will be disturbed to know that in 17 years&#x27; time they will be outnumbered by Asians in New Zealand&quot;, an estimate disputed by Statistics New Zealand, the government&#x27;s statistics bureau, which stated that with a 145% increase from 270,000 to 670,000, the Asian community would still be smaller in 2021 than the Māori, who would increase by 5% to 760,000 over the same timeframe. Peters quickly rebutted that Statistics New Zealand has underestimated the growth rate of the Asian community in the past, as the Bureau had corrected its estimation by a 66,000 increase between 2003 and 2005. In April 2008, Deputy Leader Peter Brown drew widespread attention after voicing similar views and expressing concern at the growth of New Zealand&#x27;s ethnic Asian population: &quot;If we continue this open door policy there is real danger we will be inundated with people who have no intention of integrating into our society … They will form their own mini-societies to the detriment of integration and that will lead to division, friction and resentment&quot;.

New Zealand First also espouses a mixture of economic policies. Peters has called for economic nationalism. The party supports raising the minimum wage to a living wage, opposes the privatisation of state assets (particularly to overseas buyers) and advocates buying back former state-owned enterprises. These policies align it with views generally found on the left of New Zealand politics. On the other hand, it favours reducing taxation and reducing the size of government (policies typical of the New Zealand right) and espouses both social conservatism and welfare chauvinism. New Zealand First provided for its strong support among elderly voters by its repeal of the surtax on superannuation, institution of a superannuation level of 66% of the net average wage, and introduction of the SuperGold Card. The party opposes any raising of the retirement age.

&quot;Law and order&quot; issues feature heavily in the party&#x27;s policy platform. New Zealand First advocates a stricter criminal code, longer judicial sentences, and the lowering of the age of criminal responsibility. In 2011, at its annual convention, New Zealand First vowed to repeal the controversial Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007 (which it characterised as the &quot;anti-smacking law&quot;), which a vast majority of voters rejected in a non-binding 2009 citizen-initiated referendum. In the 2017 general election campaign, the party again vowed to repeal the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act; it also ruled out a confidence and supply arrangement or coalition with any party which opposed the policy.

In 2013, all seven NZ First MPs voted against the third reading of the Marriage Amendment Bill, which permitted same sex marriage in New Zealand. Peters had called for a referendum on the issue.

====SuperGold Card====

The SuperGold Card, a discounts and concessions card for senior citizens and veterans, has been a major initiative of the party.

As a condition of the 2005 confidence and supply agreement between New Zealand First and the Labour Government, Peters launched the SuperGold Card in August 2007. The card is available to all eligible New Zealanders over the age of 65. A Veterans&#x27; SuperGold Card also exists for those who have served in the New Zealand Defence Force in a recognised war or emergency.
===Relations with Māori===
Winston Peters is Māori. At its high-water mark after the 1996 election, the party won all Māori electorates (the five MPs were nicknamed the &quot;Tight Five&quot;). It continued to receive significant support from voters registered in Māori electorates for some years afterward. New Zealand First no longer supports the retention of the Māori electorates and has declared that it will not stand candidates in the Māori electorates in the future. It did not stand candidates in the Māori electorates in the 2002, 2005, or 2008 general elections.

New Zealand First is further characterised by its strong stance on the Treaty of Waitangi. The party refers to the Treaty as a &quot;source of national pride&quot; but does not support it becoming a part of constitutional law. Peters has criticised what he refers to as a Treaty &quot;Grievance Industry&quot;—which profits from making frivolous claims of violations of the Treaty—and the cost of Treaty negotiations and settlement payments. The party has called for an end to &quot;special treatment&quot; of Māori.

On 19 July 2017, Peters promised that a New Zealand First government would hold two binding referendums on whether Maori electorates should be abolished and whether the number of MPs should be reduced to 100. Following the 2017 general election, Peters indicated that he would be willing to consider dropping his call for a referendum on abolishing the Māori electorates during coalition-forming negotiations with Labour leader Jacinda Ardern.

In 2023, Peters expressed disapproval of the utilisation of te reo Māori names for government departments, describing them as &quot;incomprehensible&quot; to the majority of New Zealanders and criticising &quot;tokenism&quot;. The coalition government, which New Zealand First has joined, has agreed to rename departments to &quot;have their primary name in English, except for those specifically related to Māori&quot;.

<doc id="342837" wikidata="Q5842736" url="?curid=342837" title="Corning Inc.">
<text>Corning Incorporated is an American multinational technology company that specializes in specialty glass, ceramics, and related materials and technologies including advanced optics, primarily for industrial and scientific applications. The company was named Corning Glass Works until 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corning-Jan-1994-S-3/A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Corning divested its consumer product lines (including CorningWare and Visions Pyroceram-based cookware, Corelle Vitrelle tableware, and Pyrex glass bakeware) in 1998 by selling the Corning Consumer Products Company subsidiary (later Corelle Brands) to Borden.

, Corning had five major business sectors: display technologies, environmental technologies, life sciences, optical communications, and specialty materials. Corning is involved in two joint ventures: Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning. The company completed the corporate spin-offs of Quest Diagnostics and Covance (now Fortrea) in January 1997. Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc. Since working with Steve Jobs in 2007, to develop the iPhone; Corning develops and manufactures Gorilla Glass, which is used by many smartphone makers. It is one of the world&#x27;s biggest glassmakers. Corning won the National Medal of Technology and Innovation four times for its product and process innovations.

Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning, N.Y. The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in 1908. It continues to expand the nearby research and development facility, as well as operations associated with catalytic converters and diesel engine filter product lines. Corning has a long history of community development and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown.

==History==
Corning Glass Works was founded in 1851 by Amory Houghton, in Somerville, Massachusetts, originally as the Bay State Glass Co. It later moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works. The company moved again to its ultimate home and eponym, the city of Corning, New York, in 1868, under leadership of the founder&#x27;s son, Amory Houghton, Jr.

In 1915, Corning created an improved heat resistant glass formula and launched Pyrex, the first-ever consumer cooking products made with temperature-resistant glass, in 1915. 

The California Institute of Technology&#x27;s telescope mirror at Palomar Observatory was cast by Corning during 1934–1936, out of low expansion borosilicate glass. In 1932, George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project. A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed. Corning&#x27;s first attempt was a failure, the cast blank having voids. Using lessons learned, Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank. After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, in 1935, the blank was completed. The first blank now resides in Corning&#x27;s Museum of Glass.

In 1935, Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker Owens-Illinois, which formed the company known today as Owens Corning. Owens Corning was spun off as a separate company in 1938.

The company had a history of science-based innovations following World War II and the strategy by management was research and &quot;disruptive&quot; and &quot;on demand&quot; product innovation.

In 1962, Corning developed Chemcor, a new toughened automobile windshield designed to be thinner and lighter than existing windshields, which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed. This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer, and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a &quot;fusion process&quot; in special furnaces that Corning built in its Christiansburg, Virginia facility. Corning developed it as an alternative to laminated windshields with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier. After being installed as side glass in a limited run of 1968 Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts, Chemcor windshields debuted on the 1970 model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation (AMC). As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields, the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products. Corning terminated its windshield project in 1971, after it turned out to be one of the company&#x27;s &quot;biggest and most expensive failures.&quot; However, like many Corning innovations, the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business.

In the fall of 1970, the company announced that researchers Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an optical fiber with a low optical attenuation of 17 dB per kilometer by doping silica glass with titanium. A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4 dB/km, using germanium oxide as the core dopant. Such low attenuations made fiber optics practical for telecommunications and networking. Corning became the world&#x27;s leading manufacturer of optical fiber.

In 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning&#x27;s Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business.

In 1998, the kitchenware division of Corning Inc. responsible for the development of Pyrex spun off from its parent company as Corning Consumer Products Company, subsequently renamed Corelle Brands. Corning Inc. no longer manufactures or markets consumer products, only industrial ones. 

Company profits soared in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly through the acquisition of telecommunications company Oak Industries and building several new plants. The company also entered the photonics market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems. Failure to succeed in photonics and the collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance.

==Technologies==
The turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a robust display screen for its upcoming iPhone. Later, other companies also adopted its Gorilla Glass screen. In 2011, Corning announced the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of a Gen 10 facility co-located with the Sharp Corporation manufacturing complex in Sakai, Osaka, Japan. The LCD glass substrate is produced without heavy metals. Corning is a leading manufacturer of the glass used in liquid crystal displays.

The company continues to produce optical fiber and cable for the communications industry at its Wilmington and Concord plants in North Carolina. It is also a major manufacturer of ceramic emission control devices for catalytic converters in cars and light trucks that use gasoline engines. The company is also investing in the production of ceramic emission control products for diesel engines as a result of tighter emission standards for those engines both in the U.S. and abroad.

In 2007, Corning introduced an optic fiber, ClearCurve, which uses nanostructure technology to facilitate the small radius bending found in FTTX installations.

Gorilla Glass, an outgrowth of the 1960s Chemcor project, is a high-strength alkali-aluminosilicate thin sheet glass used as a protective cover glass offering scratch resistance and durability in many touchscreens. According to the book &quot;Steve Jobs&quot; by Walter Isaacson, Gorilla Glass was used in the first iPhone released in 2007.

On October 25, 2011, Corning unveiled Lotus Glass, an environmentally friendly and high-performance glass developed for OLED and LCD displays.

Corning invests about 10% of revenue in research and development, and has allocated US$300 million towards further expansion of its Sullivan Park research facility near headquarters in Corning, New York.

Corning Incorporated manufactures a high-purity fused silica employed in microlithography systems, a low expansion glass utilized in the construction of reflective mirror blanks, windows for U.S. Space Shuttles, and Steuben art glass. The number of Corning facilities employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years, but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or finished glass of many types.

Corning is engaged in research and development on green lasers, mercury abatement, microreactors, photovoltaics, and silicon on glass. Through its Life Sciences division, the company offers products to support life science research, including stem-cell culture products.

In September 2019, Apple announced that it would invest $250 million in Corning, in an effort to develop and manufacture the glass needed for many of its products, including the iPhone, Apple Watch, and iPad. Though not confirmed by either company, the investment could be used to develop new products in the future. Apple had already invested $200 million in Corning in 2017.

In November 2024, The European Commission announced that Corning Inc. was under investigation for potential antitrust violations related to exclusive supply agreements with mobile phone manufacturers and raw glass processors, which may hinder competition in the specialty glass market.

==Other activities==
Corning employs roughly 61,200 people worldwide and had sales of $14.08 billion in 2021. The company has been listed for many years among &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s 500 largest companies, and was ranked #297 in 2015.

Although the company has long been publicly owned, James R. Houghton, great-great-grandson of the founder, served as chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007. Over the years Houghton family ownership has declined to about 2%. Wendell P. Weeks has been with the company since 1983 and was chairman, chief executive officer, and president.

Over its 160-year history Corning invented a process for rapid and inexpensive production of light bulbs, including developing the glass for Thomas Edison&#x27;s light bulb. Corning was the glass supplier for lightbulbs for General Electric after Edison General Electric merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1892. It was an early major manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for television tubes, invented and produced Vycor (high temperature glass with high thermal shock resistance). Corning invented and produced Pyrex, CorningWare and Visions Pyroceram glass-ceramic cookware, and Corelle durable glass dinnerware. Corning manufactured the windows for US crewed space vehicles, and supplied the glass blank for the primary mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope.

In 1982, Corning launched Chameleon® Sunglasses and Serengeti® sunglasses at retail, featuring the exclusive combination of Photochromic and Spectral Control® technologies in the lenses.

In July 2008, Corning announced the sale of Steuben Glass Works to Steuben Glass LLC, an affiliate of the private equity firm Schottenstein Stores Corporation. Steuben Glass had been unprofitable for more than a decade, losing 30 million dollars over the previous five years.

In February 2011, Corning acquired MobileAccess Networks, an Israeli company that develops Distributed antenna systems, which are often used by universities, stadiums and airports to ensure seamless wireless coverage throughout a facility. MobileAccess Networks became part of Corning&#x27;s telecommunications business unit. In July 2017, Corning acquired SpiderCloud Wireless. In December 2017, Corning acquired all of 3M Communication Market Division, in a cash transaction approximately $900 million. Acquisition closed during 2018; 3M Communication Market Division became part of Corning Optical Communications business unit.

<doc id="342838" wikidata="Q2673595" url="?curid=342838" title="Stansted, Kent">
<text>Stansted (referred to in older texts as Stanstead) is a village and rural parish in the Tonbridge and Malling district of the county of Kent in the United Kingdom (not to be confused with Stansted Mountfitchet or London Stansted Airport, both of which are in Essex).

It is located close to the M20 motorway. The Morris dancers of Stansted were one of the earliest groups to form from the revival of the activity, in 1934. The name Stansted means &quot;stony place&quot;.

==Filming location==
In January 2007 the village was used as a semi-fictional location in the filming of an episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot; broadcast in the United Kingdom over the Easter 2007 holiday season. Additional scenes were filmed at Wormshill and Ringlestone as ostensibly the same village location, notwithstanding they are some from Stansted.

==Shooting==
On 29 December 2007 villagers alerted the police to a man in the village brandishing a gun. Reports say, however, that it was perhaps the man himself who alerted the police Upon arrival, the police opened fire and eventually shot and killed him. The case has been handed over to the IPCC for consideration 

==BA confuse Stansted Airport with Stansted, Kent==
In early 2007, British Airways mistakenly used inflight &#x27;skymaps&#x27; that relocated Stansted Airport, Essex to Stansted in Kent. Skymaps show passengers their location, but the mistake was luckily not replicated on the pilots&#x27; navigation system. BA blamed outside contractors hired to make the map. &quot;It was the mistake of the independent company that produced the software,&quot; said a spokeswoman. &quot;The cartographer appears to have confused the vast Essex airport, which handles 25 million passengers a year, with this tiny Kent village, also called Stansted, which has a population of around 200&quot;.

<doc id="342842" wikidata="Q741170" url="?curid=342842" title="James Henry Greathead">
<text>James Henry Greathead (6 August 1844 – 21 October 1896) was an English mechanical and civil engineer renowned for his work on the London Underground railways, Winchester Cathedral, and Liverpool overhead railway, as well as being one of the earliest proponents of the English Channel, Irish Sea and Bristol Channel tunnels. His invention is also the reason that the London Underground is colloquially named the &quot;Tube&quot;.

== Early life ==
Greathead was born in Grahamstown, South Africa; of English descent whose grandfather had emigrated to South Africa in 1820. He was educated at St. Andrew&#x27;s College, Grahamstown, and the Diocesan College private school in Cape Town. After emigrating to England in 1859, he completed his education from 1859 to 1863 at the Westbourne Collegiate School, Westbourne Grove. 

He returned briefly to South Africa before finally moving to London in 1864 to serve a three-year pupillage under the civil engineer Peter W. Barlow, from whom he became acquainted with the rectangular shield system of tunnelling. Greathead spent some time (around 1867) as assistant engineer on the Midland Railway between Bedford and London (working with Barlow&#x27;s brother, William Henry Barlow).

== Tunnelling ==
Soon after, in 1869, he rejoined Barlow and they began work on designs for the Tower Subway, only the second tunnel to be driven under the river Thames in central London. Barlow was the engineer for the tunnel and Greathead was in charge of the actual drive.

Greathead became the main contractor for the Tower subway under Barlow. William Copperthwaite asserts that whilst Barlow had patented a tunnelling shield idea, Greathead not only designed a different type of shield but patented it and used it on that contract. Barlow had been awarded a provisional patent on his second idea but Greathead was unaware of this until several years later (as discussed in minutes of a meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) published in January 1896).

Greathead was the Blackwall Tunnel consulting engineer and oversaw its design and construction.

== Railways ==
In 1873 Greathead became resident engineer on the Hammersmith extension railway and the Richmond extension of the District Railway, a post which he held for four years. After this he assisted in the preparation of the Regents Canal Railway (1880), the Metropolitan Outer Circle Railway (1881), a new London–Eastbourne line (1883) and in various light railways in Ireland (1884).

Also in 1884, Greathead resumed his involvement in tunnelling, being engaged as engineer on the London (City) &amp; Southwark Subway, later the City &amp; South London Railway (and now part of the Northern line) which was, when it opened in 1890, the world&#x27;s first underground electric railway. In 1888, he became joint engineer with Sir Douglas Fox on the Liverpool Overhead Railway and also worked with W. R. Galbraith on the Waterloo &amp; City Railway. His final work was on the Central London Railway with Sir John Fowler and Sir Benjamin Baker.

== Inventions and patents ==
===&quot;Greathead Shield&quot;===
This possibly derived from Marc Isambard Brunel&#x27;s original patented 1818
idea and erroneously was accorded by Robert Vogel to have been inspired by Barlow&#x27;s 1864 patent that led to Barlow&#x27;s 1868 provisional patent. However, there were considerable design differences that make Greathead&#x27;s patented designs distinguishable from Brunel&#x27;s provisional patent idea, allowing a patent application for Greathead&#x27;s design.

Brunel&#x27;s shield was rectangular and comprised 12 separate, independently moveable frames; the Greathead solution was cylindrical, and the &quot;reduction of the multiplicity of parts in the Brunel shield to a single rigid unit was of immense advantage and an advance perhaps equal to the shield concept of tunneling itself&quot;, though the face was still dug out by manual labour to begin with. Greathead&#x27;s patented Shield for Tunnelling Soft Earth used water jets under pressure at the tunnel face to assist in cutting through soft earth as described in the patent. Pneumatic tunnel pressurisation was used to ensure better safety for workers by equalising internal tunnel pressure to its estimated exterior underground pressure beneath water. 

The &#x27;second edition&#x27; of his shield used hydraulic action at the face along with cutting teeth to create slurry (this slurry then hardened upon drying and led to his next invention: the Greathead Grouting Machine). Brunel may be credited for the idea of using a shield, but Greathead was recognised first as the African engineer who built one of his own design and granted a patent of the one-piece cylindrical shield. Greathead designed the prototype circular shield that has since been used in most tunnelling projects, with other engineers&#x27; advancement and technological improvement in the general shield design. In his book, &quot;Tunnel Shields and the Use of Compressed Air in Subaqueous Works&quot;, Copperthwaite (who worked under Greathead as his pupil) says:

Barlow was certainly the first to patent, in 1864, a shield capable of motion in one piece, and surrounded by a thin cylinder of iron... to build, in successive rings, a cast iron tunnel... this was in 1864 and in 1868 he provisionally patented a shield... neither of these designs took practical form and, in 1869 Greathead in England and Beach in New York actually built and used shields having many features in common with Barlow&#x27;s patents but differing from each other in details.

Copperthwaite also argues (p. 20) that all three men, Barlow, Greathead and Beach, designed their tunnelling shields independently of each other. There is evidence that Greathead was unaware until 1895 of Barlow&#x27;s 1868 provisional patent, which his shield resembled the most; Beach&#x27;s shield more closely resembled Barlow&#x27;s 1864 patent. Copperthwaite adds: &quot;the exact apportionment of the credit of the invention between these two will be decided by each reader according as he may consider the inventor, the inventor of a new mechanism, or the man who applies it practical use, the more deserving of credit.&quot; Whilst Barlow patented his idea in 1864, in 1869 both Greathead in England and Beach in New York practically simultaneously constructed their own shields that were similar but independent of each other. Greathead&#x27;s achievements went further than any other engineers&#x27; tunnelling with the additional patents of 1738 (1874), 5665 (1884) and, in 1886 his patent no. 5221: grouting by means of compressed air.

Copperthwaite clarifies the origins of the shift in thinking from a rectangular tunnel shield to cylindrical cutting shields as first built by Greathead. Minutes in the ICE library suggest Barlow quietly patented his ideas for a cylindrical cutting shield but never built one. Greathead, unaware of Barlow&#x27;s initial patent and succeeding provisional patent, went on to design, patent and build the credited first cylindrical tunnelling shield in history. Simultaneously, Alfred Ely Beach built a cylindrical tunnelling shield in New York and designed a shield that very closely resembled Barlow&#x27;s patented idea around the same time as Greathead. According to a 2017 video lecture given by Professor Lord Mair for the ICE, the Brunels&#x27; shield ideas were well known in both USA and UK. Since Barlow was a Brunel pupil, he was likely well acquainted with the rectangular tunnelling shield design. 

It must have been obvious that a cylindrical design was far more suitable and stable which led to three famous men independently designing their own unique tunneling shields within a few years of each other. Since Portland cement had only been invented in 1824 by Joseph Aspdin of Leeds, it was not fully appreciated by the construction industry for many years. It was only because of Portland cement&#x27;s hydraulic properties and ability to set in wet environments that these first tunnel ventures under the Thames came to fruition at all. Beach never came to England to learn of Barlow&#x27;s patent and later provisional patent, and Greathead did not know about Barlow&#x27;s provisional patent idea until 1895 when it was discussed in the Institution of Civil Engineers meeting attended by Greathead shortly after Barlow&#x27;s death and shortly before his own death. The documents may be obtained by request from their library in pdf format for further clarification.

The Greathead shield consisted of an iron cylinder in diameter fitted with screw jacks which enabled it to be jacked forward. In use, the shield was inched forward as the working face was excavated, while behind it a permanent tunnel lining of cast iron segments was fitted into place, itself an important innovation. Greathead patented many of his ideas including the use of compressed air and forward propulsion by hydraulic jacks, both of which are now standard features of tunnel construction. Another patent by Greathead was the addition of the grouting pan at ceiling height that allowed cement grout to be applied hydraulically behind the vast cast iron shields to stabilise the tunnel wall outside the shield sections. A third tunnelling shield was patented by Greathead that introduced hydraulic pressure nozzles at the tunnel face to blast away soft earth. The nozzle itself was also another Greathead patent invention. At some point Greathead discovered that concrete could be sprayed onto earthen surfaces to stabilise them and became the father of shot concrete and spray cement used so extensively in construction.

===&quot;Greathead Injector Hydrant&quot; (c. 1879)===
The hydrant was an invention to inject grouting behind cast iron tunnelling shield cavities to strengthen tunnel wall linings during construction with a permanent position.

== Honours ==

* An English Heritage blue plaque marks his home in Barnes, south-west London, 3 St Mary&#x27;s Grove, where he lived between 1885 and 1889. This was his third home as his second residence had been demolished prior to placement of the English Heritage plaque.
* In January 1994 a statue of Greathead was erected outside the Bank station next to the Royal Exchange in the City of London. It was unveiled by the Lord Mayor of London and is positioned on a plinth which hides a ventilation shaft for the Underground. 
* While Bank Station was being refurbished a section of the Greathead shield was discovered in a passageway between the Underground and the Waterloo and City Railway. The section has been painted red and a brass plate erected as a further memorial to his achievements.

<text>A columbarium (; pl. columbaria), also called a cinerarium, is a structure for the reverential and usually public storage of funerary urns holding cremated remains of the dead. The term comes from the Latin &quot;&quot; (dove) and originally solely referred to compartmentalized housing for doves and pigeons, also called dovecotes. 

==Background==
Roman columbaria were often built partly or completely underground. The Columbarium of Pomponius Hylas is an ancient Roman example, rich in frescoes, decorations, and precious mosaics.

Today&#x27;s columbaria can be either free standing units, or part of a mausoleum or another building. Some manufacturers produce columbaria that are built entirely offsite and brought to a cemetery by large truck. Many modern crematoria have columbaria. Examples of these are the columbaria in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and Golders Green Crematorium in London.

In other cases, columbaria are built into church structures. One example is the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels (Los Angeles, California), which houses a number of columbarium niches in the mausoleum built into the lower levels of the Cathedral. The construction of columbaria within churches is particularly widespread in the Czechoslovak Hussite Church. An example can be seen at the Church of St Nicolas in Old Town Square (Prague). In the Roman Catholic Church, although traditional burial is still preferred, cremation is permitted provided that the cremated remains are entombed and that the cremation is not done for reasons contrary to the Catholic faith. As a result, they are within some Catholic cemeteries.

Columbaria are often closely similar in form to traditional pagodas which function as in-situ columbaria pavillions at Buddhist temples, which from ancient times have housed cremated ashes. In Buddhism, ashes may be placed in a columbarium (in Chinese, a &quot;naguta&quot; (&quot;bone-receiving pagoda&quot;); in Japanese, a &quot;nōkotsudō&quot; (&quot;bone-receiving hall&quot;), which can be either attached to or a part of a Buddhist temple or cemetery. This practice allows survivors to visit the temple and carry out traditional memorials and ancestor rites.

==Caves in Israel==
In the Beit Guvrin area several series of large caves dug into soft rock were found. There were several theories about their original use, for ritual burial, for growing pigeons to be used for ritual sacrifice, or for raising pigeons for fertilizer production. One such cave had been covered by an earthquake close to the time of its original usage and had no signs of secondary usage; neither ashes nor pigeon droppings were found in it.

<text>Saint-Émilion (; Gascon: &quot;Sent Milion&quot;) is a commune in the Gironde department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in Southwestern France.

In the heart of the country of Libournais (the area around Libourne), in a region of wine hills, Saint-Émilion is a medieval city located at the crossroads of Bordeaux, Saintonge and Périgord. The town and surrounding vineyards was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999, owing to its long, living history of wine-making, Romanesque churches and ruins stretching all along steep and narrow streets.

==History==
Saint-Émilion&#x27;s history goes back at least 35,000 years, to the Upper Paleolithic. An &quot;oppidum&quot; was built on the hill overlooking the present-day city in Gaulish times, before the region was annexed by Augustus in 27 BC. The Romans planted vineyards in what was to become Saint-Émilion as early as the 2nd century AD. In the 4th century, the Latin poet Ausonius lauded the fruit of the bountiful vine.

Saint-Émilion, previously called Ascumbas, was renamed after the Breton monk Émilion (d. 767). According to tradition, Émilion started as a bread-maker for the Count of Vannes. While bringing bread to the poor, a lord angrily approached Émilion and asked him what he was carrying. “These are pieces of wood intended to warm the poor,” Émilion lied. He opened his coat and miraculously, the loaves of bread had transformed into wood. This wonder gave Émilion a high reputation, though he eventually left the manor to create the Hermitage of Saint-Émilion, carved from a rock shelter in a deserted forest. Émilion lived in the oratory until his death in 767, when Waiofar was the Duke of Aquitaine. The monks who followed him started up the commercial wine production in the area.

Because the region was located on the route of the Camino de Santiago, many monasteries and churches were built during the Middle Ages, and in 1199, while under Plantagenet rule, the town was granted full rights. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the wines produced in the area were well-renowned for their quality, although political instability during the European wars of religion negatively affected the vineyards. The region only began to recover in the late 19th century.

Saint-Émilion is known for its macaroons, which have been made continuously since 1620. The recipe has been passed down through generations by Ursuline nuns. These &quot;macarons traditionnels&quot; are made from ground almonds, sugar, and fresh egg whites.

The Jurade of Saint-Émilion is a prestigious brotherhood, founded in 1199 by John, King of England, the King of England, that preserves the memory of Saint-Émilion wines and promotes them worldwide. The authority of the Jurade lasted until the French Revolution in 1789, but was revived again in 1948. Today, the 140 &quot;jurats&quot;, who wear red robes, organize wine receptions and induction ceremonies.

==Geography and description==
Saint-Émilion is located east of Bordeaux, between Libourne and Castillon-la-Bataille. Saint-Émilion station has rail connections to Bordeaux, Bergerac and Sarlat-la-Canéda. Vineyards make up more than 67% of the land area of the commune. Within the region there is a mix of medieval Romanesque religious architecture and vineyard &quot;chateaux&quot;, built in 18th and 19th centuries. In the villages, however, most of the buildings are modest, one-story stone houses dating from the 19th century.

The Monolithic Church of Saint-Émilion

The monolithic church of Saint-Émilion is an 11th century church carved entirely out of a limestone cliff. It is one of the largest underground churches in Europe, with an estimated of rock extracted. The great hall measures long and wide, divided into three naves of six bays. Like many medieval structures, the church probably had a rich décor of painted murals; however, only a few bits of frescoes remain. Iconographic works, such as depictions of lions, serpents, centaurs, and cherubim, can be seen on the walls and ceilings, possibly in reference to Psalms. Today, visitors can enter the church and view its catacombs.

No documents exist that discuss the building of the monolithic church, but it is hypothesized that construction took place from the late 11th century to the early 12th century. Its purpose was probably to venerate and conserve the body of the 8th century Breton monk Saint Émilion. A small monastic community that gathered near his tomb appears in late 11th century texts, and Bordeaux archbishop Arnaud Guiraud reformed the community in 1110. An inscription on one of the monolithic church pillars mentions only the day of the dedication to Saint Émilion, September 7, and regretfully not the year.

The Tour du Roy

The Tour du Roy is a limestone donjon built in 1237. From its name (meaning ‘the King&#x27;s tower’), some hypothesize it was constructed by order of Henry III, King of England and Duke of Aquitaine. Other sources say the Tour du Roy isn’t royal, and was merely the municipal bell tower for the town hall until its 1720 razing by the Jurade to enlarge the other town hall in Market Square. The Tour du Roy has a height of almost and a width of more than . Visitors can climb inside the square tower for a panoramic view of the town. The tower is used by the Jurade to proclaim the judgment of new wine on the third Sunday of June, and the harvest ban on the third Sunday of September.

== Wine ==
Saint-Émilion is one of the principal red wine areas of Bordeaux along with the Médoc, Graves and Pomerol. The region is much smaller than the Médoc and adjoins Pomerol. As in Pomerol and the other appellations on the right bank of the Gironde, the primary grape varieties used are the Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with relatively small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon also being used by some châteaux.

Saint Émilion wines were not included in the 1855 Bordeaux classification. The first formal classification in Saint-Émilion was made in 1955. Unlike the 1855 classification, it is regularly revised.

<doc id="342847" wikidata="Q1726282" url="?curid=342847" title="Tower Subway">
<text>The Tower Subway is a tunnel beneath the River Thames in central London, between Tower Hill on the north bank of the river and Vine Lane (off Tooley Street) on the south. In 1869 a circular tunnel was dug through the London clay using a cast iron circular shield independently invented and built by James Henry Greathead, similar to an idea that had been patented in 1864 by Peter W. Barlow, but never built.

A narrow-gauge railway was laid in the tunnel and from August 1870 a cable-hauled wooden carriage conveyed passengers from one end to the other. This was uneconomic and the company went bankrupt by the end of the year. The tunnel was converted to pedestrian use and one million people a year crossed under the river, paying a toll of a ha&#x27;penny. The opening of the toll-free Tower Bridge nearby in 1894 caused a drop in income and the tunnel closed in 1898, after being sold to the London Hydraulic Power Company. Today the tunnel is used for water mains and telecommunications cables.

The same shield method of construction was used in 1890 to dig the tunnels of the City and South London Railway, the first of London&#x27;s electrified &quot;Tube&quot; railways and the first underground electrified railway in the world.

== History ==

=== Construction ===
In 1864 Peter Barlow applied for a patent design of a circular cast iron shield for tunnelling To fill the gap between the tunnel lining and wall with lime or cement to prevent settling of the surrounding ground, but it was Greathead who invented a device to inject the grout. Unfortunately, Barlow failed to explain how he intended to fill such gaps between shield and tunnel wall with grout. He published a pamphlet in 1867 suggesting a network of tunnels with cars carrying up to twelve people. In 1868 authority was obtained in the (31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. viii) for a tunnel under the Thames between Great Tower Hill and Pickle Herring Stairs near Vine Street (now Vine Lane), but there was a delay finding a contractor due to recent experiences with the Thames Tunnel until his former pupil James Henry Greathead tendered for £9,400. Whilst Barlow patented his idea in 1864 for a tunnelling shield, he never constructed it before his death: Greathead was accredited with the first shield construction for what is now known as the Tower Gateway complex in 1869. According to William Charles Copperthwaite, who once studied and worked under Greathead, both Greathead in England, and Alfred Ely Beach in New York, invented and constructed their own versions of tunnelling shields simultaneously and independently of each other.

Beach used a circular shield remarkably similar to Peter W. Barlow&#x27;s patent application design. This would not have been an unexpected event as Beach oversaw a successful patent agency in New York as the editor of &quot;The Scientific American&quot;, and may well have heard of Tower Subway developments in London and found Barlow&#x27;s patent application.

Work on the Tower Subway began in February 1869 with the boring of entrance shafts, deep on the north bank and deep on the south bank. The tunnelling itself started in April using the circular Greathead shield.

Whilst many argue that the shield used was a &quot;Barlow–Greathead&quot; shield, William Copperthwaite says &quot;... in 1868 [Barlow] provisionally patented a shield having near the cutting edge a transverse partition or diaphragm. Neither of these designs took practical form, and in 1869 Greathead in England and Beach in New York actually built and used shields having many features in common with Barlow&#x27;s patents but differing from each other in details... Beach&#x27;s shield resembled Barlow&#x27;s patent of 1864, and Greathead&#x27;s the provisional patent of 1868.&quot; Copperthwaite puts to bed all arguments over origins of tunnelling shields as being the patented but unimplemented idea of Barlow&#x27;s in 1864 but the actual construction of a different patented device by Greathead was built and first used on the Tower Subway and simultaneously in New York, Beach created and made his own shield independently of Barlow&#x27;s and Greathead&#x27;s designs. Barlow lost out on credit because he never actually constructed one, only patenting the idea. Copperthwaite also reveals that Greathead was unaware of the 1868 provisional patent of Barlow&#x27;s until 1895, a fact discussed in an 1895 Institution of Civil Engineers paper on the City and South London Railway acknowledged by Barlow.

A tunnel long was dug with a diameter of , a maximum of below the high-water level. This was bored through a stable layer of the London clay that lay below the river bed, below the soft alluvial deposits that had plagued the construction by Brunel of the earlier Thames Tunnel. This, combined with the simpler nature of the project – the excavation face was only one twentieth that of the Thames Tunnel – enabled faster progress. Screw jacks drove the shield forward at a rate of each week. The under-river section was dug in fourteen weeks and the tunnel completed in December 1869.

=== Cable railway ===

The entrance shafts were fitted with steam-powered lifts for passengers. The tunnel was laid with gauge railway track and a single car, carrying a maximum of 12 passengers, cable-hauled by two stationary steam engines, one on each side of the river.

The tunnel was completed by February 1870, and a press launch was held the following April. The underground railway opened for public use on 2 August 1870 charging 2d for first class and 1d for second class, first class ticket holders merely having priority for the lifts and when boarding. However, the system was unreliable and uneconomic. The company went into receivership in November 1870, and the railway closed on 7 December 1870, four months after opening.

=== Foot tunnel ===

The railcar and steam engines were removed, gaslights installed and the passenger lifts replaced with spiral staircases. The tunnel opened to pedestrians on 24 December 1870 at a toll of d and became a popular way to cross the river, averaging 20,000 people a week (one million a year). Its main users were described as &quot;the working classes who were formerly entirely dependent on the ferries&quot;. In September 1888 the subway briefly achieved notoriety after a man with a knife was seen in the tunnel at the time when Jack the Ripper was committing murders in nearby Whitechapel.

In his &quot;Dictionary of London&quot;, Charles Dickens Jr commented on the smallness of the tunnel: &quot;there is not much head-room left, and it is not advisable for any but the very briefest of Her Majesty&#x27;s lieges to attempt the passage in high-heeled boots, or with a hat to which he attaches any particular value.&quot;

The Italian writer Edmondo De Amicis (1846–1908) gave a description of a passage through the subway in his &quot;Jottings about London&quot;:


In 1894 the toll-free Tower Bridge opened a few hundred yards downriver, causing a drop in the subway&#x27;s income. The Tower Bridge Subway Company sued the Corporation of London for £30,000 for loss of revenue. Engineer Edward Cruttwell was a key witness in the arbitration arguing that the claim was unfounded with the subway being in a &quot;very neglected condition.&quot;

In 1897, Parliament passed a local act, the (60 &amp; 61 Vict. c.xcvii) authorising the sale of the tunnel to the London Hydraulic Power Company (LHPC) for £3,000 (worth over £ in ), and the subway closed to pedestrian traffic in 1898.

=== Utility tunnel ===
After its closure, the tunnel gained a new purpose as a route for hydraulic power mains operated by the LHPC and for water mains. It was damaged during the Second World War when a German bomb fell in the river near Tower Pier in December 1940, and exploded on the river bed very close to the tunnel&#x27;s roof. The shock of the blast compressed the tunnel radially, reducing its diameter to at the point of impact, but the tunnel&#x27;s lining was not penetrated. During the course of repair work, it was found that – apart from the bomb damage – the tunnel had survived seventy years of use in excellent condition.

== The subway today ==
While it is no longer used for hydraulic tubes, the tunnel still carries water mains. The hydraulic tubes, once a major source of power in the centre of London, have since been replaced by fibre optic telecommunications links.

A small round entrance building survives at Tower Hill near the Tower of London&#x27;s ticket office, a short distance to the west of the main entrance to the Tower. This is not the original entrance but was built in 1926 by the London Hydraulic Power Company, with a ring of lettering giving the original date of construction and naming the LHPC. The entrance on the south bank of the Thames was demolished in the 1990s, and a new one has been built in its place. It is located just behind the Unicorn Theatre on Tooley Street, but there is no plaque to mark the site.

A video inside the tunnel from the current owners, Vodafone, was released in February 2023.

<doc id="342848" wikidata="Q1090667" url="?curid=342848" title="Château Pétrus">
<text>Pétrus is a Bordeaux, France, wine estate located in the Pomerol appellation near its eastern border to Saint-Émilion. A small estate of just , it produces a red wine entirely from Merlot grapes (since the end of 2010), and produces no second wine. The estate belongs to Jean-François Moueix and his children.

Although the wines of Pomerol have never been classified, Pétrus is widely regarded as the outstanding wine of the appellation. Pétrus leads a duo of Pomerol estates in extreme prices, along with Le Pin, that rank consistently among the world&#x27;s most expensive wines. A 750 ml bottle of Pétrus wine is priced at an average of $4,112.

==History==
Originally, a vineyard, the estate had been owned by the Arnaud family since the end of the 18th century, and the name first appears in records from 1837. In the 1868 edition of &quot;Cocks &amp; Féret&quot;, under listing &quot;Crus bourgeois et 1ers artisans&quot;, Pétrus was ranked behind Vieux Château Certan and alongside Château Trotanoy. Some vintages of this period were labelled Petrus-Arnaud. At the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1878, Pétrus won a gold medal, at a time when such an event had very significant results, establishing a selling price at the level of a Médoc second growth, the first wine of Pomerol to do so.

In 1917, the Arnaud family had to sell and La Société Civile du Château Pétrus, a share-holding company, was set up. Around 1925, the owner of the Hôtel Loubat in Libourne, the widow Mme. Edmond Loubat, began to buy shares in the estate and continued the acquisition progressively until 1945, when she became the sole owner of the domaine.

According to David Peppercorn, &quot;the great age of Pétrus&quot; began with the end of World War II and the successful 1945 vintage. Jean-Pierre Moueix of the Libourne &quot;négociant&quot; house (Établissements Jean-Pierre Moueix) acquired exclusive selling rights of Pétrus in that year, and the international reputation of Pétrus began to grow. Mme. Loubat, who also owned Château Latour à Pomerol, remained an active &quot;vigneronne&quot; throughout her life, known for her meticulous dedication to detail and quality, and strong determination that her wine deserved to be priced equal to the great &quot;crus&quot;.

In the following years, the efficient partnership with Moueix became prosperous. Pétrus was introduced to the United States. In 1947, Mme. Loubat presented two magnums of 1938 Pétrus to the Lord Mayor of London, who had come to Pomerol for a visit, for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth.

After the 1956 winter frost that devastated the grapevines of the Bordeaux region and killed two-thirds of the Pétrus vineyard, Mme. Loubat decided not to replant but to coppice (cut back severely) the vines on surviving rootstocks; this process of &quot;recépage&quot; had been previously untried in the region; her success ensured that the vines&#x27; average age remained high and established a tradition that has since been followed.

Pétrus&#x27; fame in the U.S. grew in the 1960s, with the promotion by Henri Soulé, owner of the restaurant Le Pavillon in New York. According to Alexis Lichine, &quot;[Pétrus] was served at Le Pavillon in the days when Onassis sat at a corner table. After that, Pétrus became a status symbol, the sort of name dropped by people who wish to imply not only that they know wine but that they are in wine&quot;.

On the death of Mme. Loubat in 1961, the estate was divided between a niece and nephew, Mme. Lily Lacoste-Loubat and M. Lignac, and a share was left to Jean-Pierre Moueix to break any deadlock between them and to ensure Moueix&#x27; continued influence. For a period, the estate was represented by the niece, but in 1964, Jean-Pierre Moueix bought the Lignac shares, and the oenologist Jean-Claude Berrouet became permanently attached to Pétrus. Prior to this, Émile Peynaud had been employed as a part-time consultant. In 1969, of vineyard were added to the estate, purchased from neighbouring Château Gazin. increasing the surface area of Petrus from 7 to 11.4 hectares (28 acres).

Following the death of Jean-Pierre Moueix in 2003, his son Jean-François Moueix, head of Groupe Duclot, is the owner of Pétrus; he and his children have controlled distribution worldwide via Clés Distribution since 2014. When Jean-Claude Berrouet retired as technical director after 45 vintages in 2008, he was replaced by his son Olivier Berrouet, who now manages the vineyard and the wine making.

In September 2018, Jean-François Moueix&#x27;s entourage confirmed that 20 percent of the capital had been sold to Colombian-American billionaire Alejandro Santo Domingo.

==Terroir==

The vineyard of Pétrus covers and is located on a plateau in the eastern portion of Pomerol.

Located on top of a island mound, the &quot;Pétrus boutonnière&quot; or buttonhole, Pétrus&#x27; original vineyard possesses topsoil and subsoil high in iron-rich clay that differs from neighbouring vineyards, where the soil is a mixture of gravel-sand or clay-sand.

The estate was among the first in Bordeaux to implement green-harvesting or éclaircissage as a way to lower crop yields and raise the quality of the remaining grapes.

== Grape varieties ==
The grape variety distribution is 100% Merlot since the end of 2010. The average age of the vines exceeds 45 years. This grape variety is made up of black, medium round berries. The administration of the estate takes particular care to maximize the quality of the harvest.

== Production ==
Petrus produces an average of 30,000 bottles per year. The grapes are hand harvested over two to three days. The wine is aged between 12 and 16 months in oak barrels, half of which are new, before bottling. A stringent pre-assemblage vat selection is carried out and certain parcels are rejected from the Grand Vin.

== Description ==
The wine is characterized by great elegance, a complex and powerful nose and a particularly opulent fruit. The guide to Bettana and Desseauve wines (2016) describes Petrus as follows: &quot;With its refined and deep tension and the right density, its taffeta texture and floral returns, Petrus is a wine that shines and gradually imposes itself on you.&quot;

== Vintages ==
The best vintages are generally recognized as 1929, 1945, 1947, 1961, 1964, 1982, 1989, 1990, 2000, 2005, 2009, and 2010. In 1956, 1965, and 1991, the harvests did not produce a wine of sufficient quality and these vintages do not exist. The years 1963, 1968, 1977, or 1984 exist in very small quantities for the same reason. The vintages 1921, 1929, 1947, 1961, 1989, 1990, 2000, 2009, and 2010 all received a score of 100/100 from critic Robert Parker.

== Cost ==
The price of a bottle varies from 1,000 euros for a &quot;small&quot; vintage to more than 2,500 euros for a great vintage, or even 6,000 euros for an exceptional vintage such as 1947 or 1961. According to the Wine-searcher site, Petrus is the sixth most expensive wine in the world, after five Burgundy wines, and an average price of US$625,000 (about €600,000) for all vintages and countries combined.

<text>A bilayer is a double layer of closely packed atoms or molecules.

The properties of bilayers are often studied in condensed matter physics, particularly in the context of semiconductor devices, where two distinct materials are united to form junctions, such as p–n junctions, Schottky junctions, etc. Layered materials, such as graphene, boron nitride, or transition metal dichalcogenides, have unique electronic properties as bilayer systems and are an active area of current research.

In biology, a common example is the lipid bilayer, which describes the structure of multiple organic structures, such as the membrane of a cell.

<text>Gewürztraminer (, ) is an aromatic wine grape variety, used in white wines, and which performs best in cooler climates. In English, it is sometimes referred to colloquially as Gewürz ( ; although this is never the case in German, because means &quot;herb&quot; or &quot;spice&quot;). In English and French it is usually written  (without the umlaut). Gewürztraminer is a variety with a pink to red skin colour, which makes it a &quot;white wine grape&quot; as opposed to the blue to black-skinned varieties commonly referred to as &quot;red wine grapes&quot;. The variety has high natural sugar and the wines are white and usually off-dry, with a flamboyant bouquet of lychees. Indeed, Gewürztraminer and lychees share the same aroma compounds. Dry Gewürztraminers may also have aromas of roses, passion fruit and floral notes. It is not uncommon to notice some &quot;spritz&quot; (fine bubbles on the inside of the glass).

Gewürztraminer&#x27;s sweetness may offset the spice in Southeast Asian cuisine.

==Etymology==
The German name Gewürztraminer literally means &quot;Spice Traminer&quot; or &quot;Perfumed Traminer&quot;, and is attested in Germany from the 16th century. This grape variety is a mutation of the Savagnin blanc, also named Traminer in South Tyrol (region situated in northern Italy).

==History==
The history of the Traminer family is complicated, and not helped by its rather unstable genome. The story starts with the ancient Traminer variety, a green-skinned grape that takes its name from the village of Tramin, located in South Tyrol, the mainly German-speaking province in northern Italy. The famous ampelographer Pierre Galet thought that Traminer was identical to the green-skinned Savagnin blanc (not Sauvignon blanc) that makes vin jaune in the Jura. More recently it has been suggested that Savagnin blanc acquired slight differences in its leaf shape and geraniol content as it travelled to the other end of the Alps.

Frankisch in Austria, Gringet in Savoie, Heida in Switzerland, Formentin in Hungary and Grumin from Bohemia are all very similar to Savagnin blanc and probably represent clones of the Traminer family, if not Traminer itself. The Viognier of the Rhone Valley may be a more distant relative of Savagnin blanc.

At some point, either Traminer or Savagnin blanc mutated into a form with pink-skinned berries, called Red Traminer or Savagnin rose. Galet believed that a musqué (&#x27;muscat-like&#x27;) mutation in the Red Traminer/Savagnin rose then led to the extra-aromatic Gewürztraminer, although in Germany these names are all regarded as synonymous.

With these convoluted genetics happening in the area that has been the front line for a millennium of wars in Europe, it is maybe not surprising that vines have been misnamed. Given that the wine made from &#x27;Gewürztraminer&#x27; in Germany can be much less aromatic than that in Alsace, some of the German vines may well be misidentified Savagnin Rose. The Baden vineyard of Durbach claims its own type of Red Traminer called Durbacher Clevner (not to be confused with &quot;Klevner&quot;, an Austrian synonym for Pinot blanc). The story goes that in 1780 Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden brought vines from Chiavenna in Italy, halfway between Tramin and the Jura, which was known to the Germans as Cleven.

The Klevener de Heiligenstein or Heiligensteiner Klevener found around Heiligenstein in Alsace may represent an outpost of the Durbach vines. They are often described as a less aromatic form of Gewürztraminer.

Traminer is recorded in Tramin from ca. 1000 until the 16th century. It was spread down the Rhine to Alsace, by way of the Palatinate, where Gewürz (spice) was added to its name – presumably this was when one of the mutations happened. The longer name was first used in Alsace (then under German rule) in the 1870&#x27;s (. It is not clear what this name change represents, as it seems too great a coincidence that the musqué mutation happened just after the arrival of the great phylloxera epidemic. More likely, an existing mutant was selected for grafting onto phylloxera-resistant rootstocks when the vineyards were replanted. In 1973 the name Traminer was discontinued in Alsace except for in the Heiligenstein area.

== Crosses ==

The Germans have tried hard to breed the flavours of Gewürztraminer into vines that are easier to grow. In 1932, Georg Scheu crossed Gewürztraminer with Müller-Thurgau to produce Würzer, a little of which is grown in Rheinhessen and in England. Similar crosses at Alzey and Würzburg respectively have produced Septimer and the reasonably successful Perle. The early-ripening Siegerrebe is the result of a cross with Madeleine Angevine at Alzey and is notable for producing the highest ever must weight recorded in Germany, 326 °Oechsle. A cross between Müller-Thurgau and Siegerrebe produced Ortega.

Cserszegi fűszeres is the result of a Hungarian cross with Irsai Oliver.

In 1938, Harold Olmo crossed Sémillon and Gewürztraminer at U.C. Davis to make Flora, which is grown a little in California and New Zealand – in the latter it was mistaken for a late-ripening clone of Pinot gris. Brown Bros blend it with Orange Muscat in Australia.

In 1965, Gewürztraminer was crossed with Joannes Seyve 23.416 at the University of Illinois to produce a hybrid variety called Traminette. Traminette is more cold-tolerant than the original, while maintaining most of the desirable taste and aroma characteristics.

In the late 20th century, Australian viticulturalist and grape breeder A.J. Antcliff crossed Gewürztraminer with Merbein 29-56 to create the white grape variety Taminga.

During a series of trials between 1924 and 1930, Gewürztraminer was crossed with Trebbiano to create the pink-skinned Italian wine grape variety Manzoni rosa.

In 1970s, Czech winemaker and grape breeder Ing. Josef Veverka crossed in former Czechoslovakia Gewürztraminer with Müller-Thurgau to create the wine grape variety Pálava (the name refers to the Pálava hills located in the south Moravia). The grape variety is pink-skinned, earlier, more productive and of a finer traminer-like aroma. Pálava is grown in Moravia (Czech Republic) and Slovakia.

==Regions==

In Europe, the grape is grown in Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and in Turkey. In the New World, the grape is grown in California and Northern Michigan, New Zealand, and in Mendoza, the most important wine region of Argentina and in the far south of Chile. In the Middle East, the grape is grown in the Golan Heights.

===Australia===
Australian Gewürztraminer is more notable for its occasional use of old names like Traminer Musqué and Gentil Rose Aromatique than the actual quality of the wines. However recently those from the country&#x27;s coolest regions can be fine examples. These include Gewürztraminers from the Adelaide Hills, Eden Valley, the island of Tasmania, Clare Valley, Yarra Valley and the vineyards scattered in the Australian Alps. The Macedon Ranges, just north of Melbourne, has a cold climate and volcanic soils, much suited to production of Gewürztraminer. (Macedon Ranges Vignerons Association.)

===Canada===
Canadian wine regions where it is grown include Vancouver Island and the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, the Niagara Peninsula, and the north shore of Lake Erie and Prince Edward County wine regions of Ontario.
===France===
Gewürztraminer is planted in Alsace, where it is the second most planted grape variety and the one most characteristic of the region. It grows better in the south of the region. Styles of range from the very dry Trimbach house style to the very sweet. The variety&#x27;s high natural sugar means that it is popular for making dessert wine, both vendange tardive and the noble rot-affected Sélection de Grains Nobles.

As mentioned above, around Heiligenstein there is a grape known as Klevener de Heiligenstein, which is a Red Traminer (Savagnin Rose) and not a true Gewürz; the Heiligenstein wines are certainly more restrained than other Gewurztraminers d&#x27;Alsace.

===Germany===
Germany has about 10 square kilometres of the variety, but it is very different from that of their neighbours across the Rhine. As suggested above much of their &quot;Gewürztraminer&quot; is probably Red Traminer. The Germans go for a relatively dry style, that tries to subdue the natural flamboyance of the grape.

===Italy===
The Traminer is native to the cool Alpine slopes of the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol in northeastern Italy. Whether the Gewürz- mutant originated there or not is an open question, but it is certainly grown there today. What is certain is that the name &quot;Traminer&quot; derives from the town of Tramin. Confusingly, both pink and green grapes may be called simply Traminer.

===Luxembourg===
Luxembourg has also been prominent in the production of wines with Gewürztraminer grapes.

=== New Zealand ===
Even though the volumes produced remain tiny, Gewürztraminer is more and more popular in New Zealand. Around 200 hectares are being grown today, including 70ha in Marlborough, 54ha in Hawke&#x27;s Bay, 19ha in Gisborne, 18ha in North Canterbury and 10ha in Central Otago.

===United States===
In the United States, Gewürztraminer grapes are concentrated in Monterey, Mendocino and Sonoma in California, the Columbia Valley of Washington and Oregon, and the Snake River Region of Idaho. It is also grown in Michigan, Rhode Island, Caddo County, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Indiana, Hawaii, Texas, Virginia, Maryland, Missouri, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Grand Valley, Colorado and the Finger Lakes and Long Island Regions of New York.

==Vine and viticulture==
Gewürztraminer is especially sensitive to both soil and climate. The vine grows vigorously, but it does not do well in chalky soils and is very susceptible to disease. It buds early, so is very susceptible to frost, needs dry and warm summers, and ripens erratically and late. Its natural sweetness means that in hot climates it does not have enough acidity to balance the huge amounts of sugar, and picking early to retain the acidity means that the varietal aromas do not develop. These aromas may be further diluted by overcropping in an attempt to overcome the low yields.

==Synonyms== 
Genetic instability means that the Traminers should be regarded as a family of related clones, rather than distinct varieties. Thus DNA analysis will probably reveal that the following names are not synonymous. It gets even worse when it comes to Gewürztraminer, as Geilweilerhof, being Germans, see no difference between it and Red Traminer – and some of the names look like they belong to the original green-skinned Traminer/Savagnin blanc.

<text>Theatre Workshop is a theatre group whose long-serving director was Joan Littlewood. Many actors of the 1950s and 1960s received their training and first exposure with the company, many of its productions were transferred to theatres in the West End, and some, such as &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot; and &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;, were made into films.

==Formation==
Joan Littlewood and Ewan MacColl met and married in 1934, while both were working with the Theatre of Action. They started their own collaboration developing radio plays for the BBC, taking scripts and cast from local workers. However, both MI5 and the Special Branch maintained a watch on the couple because of their support for the Communist Party of Great Britain. Littlewood was precluded from working for the BBC as a children&#x27;s programme presenter and some of MacColl&#x27;s work was banned from broadcast. 

In the late 1930s Littlewood and MacColl formed an acting troupe called the Theatre Union. This was dissolved in 1940, but in 1945 many of its former members joined Joan Littlewood&#x27;s new venture, the Theatre Workshop. In 1948 the company toured Czechoslovakia and Sweden.

==Theatre Royal, Stratford East==
===Joan Littlewood (1953–1979)===
Touring was not successful for the company, and in 1953 Joan Littlewood took the gamble of taking a lease on a permanent base at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, London. The theatre was derelict, no funds were available for renovation, and the actors cleaned and painted the auditorium between rehearsals. To save money the cast and crew slept in the dressing rooms (while Littlewood went back to her home in Blackheath). The theatre opened on 2 February 1953 with &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

MacColl had not supported the move to London, and left the company to concentrate on folk music. With Littlewood, as director, Gerry Raffles (1928–1975) as manager and John Bury as designer, the Theatre Workshop continued to present a mixed programme of classics and modern plays with contemporary themes. The cast and crew (again excluding Littlewood, who was then living with Raffles) lived and worked as a commune, sharing the many tasks associated with running and maintaining a theatre, and with a duty roster for &quot;chef of the week&quot;.

In April 1953, a request for funds was met with
&quot;The Finance Committee at their last meeting was unable to recommend any grant for the purposes you have in mind. However, the Committee indicated that they would be prepared to assist, where possible in the matter of publicity, providing this could be done without cost to the Committee&quot;

Success came following an invitation from Claude Planson, the director of the Paris International Festival of Theatre, to represent England at the festival in 1955. The company travelled to Paris with costumes in their suitcases and scenery under their arms. In May 1955 Theatre Workshop presented acclaimed productions of &quot;Volpone&quot; and &quot;Arden of Faversham&quot; at the Théâtre Hébertot, though the company had to beg their fares home. The Arts Council and critics became aware of the company, and they returned to Paris with six more productions. In 1963 they won the Award of the Grande Prix du Festival for &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot;.

In 1955 Littlewood directed, and took the leading role in, the London premiere of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot;.

Finances continued to be tight, but the company was kept afloat with transfers of many successful plays to the West End stage and later, film productions. This workload put a severe strain on resources, as these transfers meant that experienced cast members were tied up for long periods and had to be replaced in the repertory. 

Until 1968, the Theatres Act 1843 required scripts to be submitted for approval by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office. This caused conflicts because of the improvisational theatre techniques used by Littlewood to develop plays for performance. She was twice prosecuted and fined for allowing the company to improvise in performance.

The &quot;Fun Palace&quot; was an ambitious multi-arts project conceived by Littlewood and the company in conjunction with the architect Cedric Price. The project was never built, but the concept may have influenced later projects such the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Another project conceived in the 1960s was the formation of an acting school associated with Theatre Workshop to inspire a new generation of actors with the ideas and techniques of Littlewood. Although Littlewood herself strongly disapproved, believing that acting was an unteachable skill, the East 15 Acting School became successful. It is now based in its own premises in Loughton. In 2000 the school became part of the University of Essex.

By the end of the 1960s both the company and the theatre were under threat. The Theatre Workshop presented revivals of its own productions and a campaign was begun to save the theatre from redevelopment as part of a new shopping centre planned to transform the centre of Stratford. Audiences mounted a campaign to save the theatre and for many years it remained open in the centre of a building site.

In 1975 Gerry Raffles died of diabetes and in 1979 Littlewood moved to France, and ceased to direct.

Many well-regarded television and stage actors began their professional careers at Theatre Workshop under Littlewood&#x27;s tutelage. They included Yootha Joyce, Glynn Edwards, Harry H. Corbett, George A. Cooper, Richard Harris, Stephen Lewis, Howard Goorney, Brian Murphy, Murray Melvin, Nigel Hawthorne and Barbara Windsor. The last three were cast by the director Ken Russell to appear in the film version of &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; (1971) with Twiggy.

===Philip Hedley (1979–2004)===
Philip Hedley had worked as an assistant to Joan Littlewood for some years, and took over the artistic directorship on her departure from the theatre. He continued her educational work, and engaged with new Asian and Black audiences as the local demographic changed. The theatre continued Littlewood&#x27;s agenda of portraying and expressing the experience of local people in East London.

In 1999 Hedley began the Musical Theatre Initiatives scheme to encourage new writing in musical theatre. In 2004, after 25 years as artistic director, he retired.

===Kerry Michael MBE (2004–2017)===

Kerry Michael is a second-generation Greek Cypriot who was born and brought up in North London. He joined Stratford East in 1997, as an associate director. He became director in September 2004. His manifesto is to bring London&#x27;s new communities to the stage, and portray their experiences as second- and third-generation emigrants. Michael has upheld the theatre’s commitment to develop new work and to provide a platform for those voices underrepresented in the ever-changing communities of East London. 

In 2007 the theatre was nominated for an Olivier Award for &quot;presenting a powerful season of provocative work that reaches new audiences&quot;. Its hip-hop dance production of Boy Blue’s Pied Piper won an Oliver in the same year. In the following year Kerry’s production of &quot;Cinderella&quot; was also nominated for an Olivier.

Michael has numerous directing credits. Highlights include new plays by Cosh Omar, &quot;The Battle of Green Lanes&quot; and &quot;The Great Extension&quot;; &quot;Jamaica House&quot; by Paul Sirett, which had a site-specific performance on the top floor of a tower block in Stepney; new musicals such as &quot;Make Some Noise&quot; and &quot;One Dance Will Do&quot;; Ray Davies’s &quot;Come Dancing&quot;, winner of the &quot;What’s On Stage&quot; Best Musical; and John Adam&#x27;s song play &quot;I Was Looking At The Ceiling And Then I Saw The Sky&quot;.

Michael is Chair of Stratford Cultural Forum, a board member of Stratford Renaissance Partnership, a trustee of Discover, which provides creative, play and learning opportunities for children and their carers in Stratford, and a member of UK Equity’s International Committee for Artists&#x27; Freedom.

In 2018 he was awarded a Freedom of the City of London and made a Member of the Order of the Empire for services to the Arts in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday honours.

<text>In time series analysis, dynamic time warping (DTW) is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences, which may vary in speed. For instance, similarities in walking could be detected using DTW, even if one person was walking faster than the other, or if there were accelerations and decelerations during the course of an observation. DTW has been applied to temporal sequences of video, audio, and graphics data — indeed, any data that can be turned into a one-dimensional sequence can be analyzed with DTW. A well-known application has been automatic speech recognition, to cope with different speaking speeds. Other applications include speaker recognition and online signature recognition. It can also be used in partial shape matching applications.

In general, DTW is a method that calculates an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g. time series) with certain restriction and rules:
* Every index from the first sequence must be matched with one or more indices from the other sequence, and vice versa
* The first index from the first sequence must be matched with the first index from the other sequence (but it does not have to be its only match)
* The last index from the first sequence must be matched with the last index from the other sequence (but it does not have to be its only match)
* The mapping of the indices from the first sequence to indices from the other sequence must be monotonically increasing, and vice versa, i.e. if formula_1 are indices from the first sequence, then there must not be two indices formula_2 in the other sequence, such that index formula_3 is matched with index formula_4 and index formula_5 is matched with index formula_6, and vice versa
We can plot each match between the sequences formula_7 and formula_8 as a path in a formula_9 matrix from formula_10 to formula_11, such that each step is one of formula_12. In this formulation, we see that the number of possible matches is the Delannoy number.

The optimal match is denoted by the match that satisfies all the restrictions and the rules and that has the minimal cost, where the cost is computed as the sum of absolute differences, for each matched pair of indices, between their values.

The sequences are &quot;warped&quot; non-linearly in the time dimension to determine a measure of their similarity independent of certain non-linear variations in the time dimension. This sequence alignment method is often used in time series classification. Although DTW measures a distance-like quantity between two given sequences, it doesn&#x27;t guarantee the triangle inequality to hold.

In addition to a similarity measure between the two sequences (a so called &quot;warping path&quot; is produced), by warping according to this path the two signals may be aligned in time. The signal with an original set of points &quot;X&quot;(original), &quot;Y&quot;(original) is transformed to &quot;X&quot;(warped), &quot;Y&quot;(warped). This finds applications in genetic sequence and audio synchronisation. In a related technique sequences of varying speed may be averaged using this technique see the average sequence section.

This is conceptually very similar to the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm.

== Implementation ==

This example illustrates the implementation of the dynamic time warping algorithm when the two sequences s and t are strings of discrete symbols. For two symbols x and y, codice_1 is a distance between the symbols, e.g. codice_1 = formula_13.

 int DTWDistance(s: array [1..n], t: array [1..m]) {
 DTW := array [0..n, 0..m]
 for i := 0 to n
 for j := 0 to m
 DTW[i, j] := infinity
 DTW[0, 0] := 0
 for i := 1 to n
 for j := 1 to m
 cost := d(s[i], t[j])
 DTW[i, j] := cost + minimum(DTW[i-1, j ], // insertion
 DTW[i , j-1], // deletion
 DTW[i-1, j-1]) // match
 return DTW[n, m]

where codice_3 is the distance between codice_4 and codice_5 with the best alignment.

We sometimes want to add a locality constraint. That is, we require that if codice_6 is matched with codice_7, then formula_14 is no larger than w, a window parameter.

We can easily modify the above algorithm to add a locality constraint (differences &lt;mark&gt;marked&lt;/mark&gt;).
However, the above given modification works only if formula_15 is no larger than w, i.e. the end point is within the window length from diagonal. In order to make the algorithm work, the window parameter w must be adapted so that formula_16 (see the line marked with (*) in the code).

 int DTWDistance(s: array [1..n], t: array [1..m]&lt;mark&gt;, w: int&lt;/mark&gt;) {
 DTW := array [0..n, 0..m]
 &lt;mark&gt;w := max(w, abs(n-m))&lt;/mark&gt; // adapt window size (*)
 for i := 0 to n
 for j:= 0 to m
 DTW[i, j] := infinity
 DTW[0, 0] := 0
 &lt;mark&gt;for i := 1 to n&lt;/mark&gt;
 &lt;mark&gt;for j := max(1, i-w) to min(m, i+w)&lt;/mark&gt;
 &lt;mark&gt;DTW[i, j] := 0&lt;/mark&gt;
 for i := 1 to n
 for j := &lt;mark&gt;max(1, i-w) to min(m, i+w)&lt;/mark&gt;
 cost := d(s[i], t[j])
 DTW[i, j] := cost + minimum(DTW[i-1, j ], // insertion
 DTW[i , j-1], // deletion
 DTW[i-1, j-1]) // match
 return DTW[n, m]

==Warping properties==
The DTW algorithm produces a discrete matching between existing elements of one series to another. In other words, it does not allow time-scaling of segments within the sequence. Other methods allow continuous warping. For example, Correlation Optimized Warping (COW) divides the sequence into uniform segments that are scaled in time using linear interpolation, to produce the best matching warping. The segment scaling causes potential creation of new elements, by time-scaling segments either down or up, and thus produces a more sensitive warping than DTW&#x27;s discrete matching of raw elements.

==Complexity==
The time complexity of the DTW algorithm is formula_17, where formula_18 and formula_19 are the lengths of the two input sequences. The 50 years old quadratic time bound was broken in 2016: an algorithm due to Gold and Sharir enables computing DTW in formula_20 time and space for two input sequences of length formula_18. 
This algorithm can also be adapted to sequences of different lengths. Despite this improvement, it was shown that a strongly subquadratic running time of the form formula_22 for some formula_23 cannot exist unless the Strong exponential time hypothesis fails.

While the dynamic programming algorithm for DTW requires formula_17 space in a naive implementation, the space consumption can be reduced to formula_25 using Hirschberg&#x27;s algorithm.

==Fast computation==

Fast techniques for computing DTW include PrunedDTW, SparseDTW, FastDTW, and the MultiscaleDTW.

A common task, retrieval of similar time series, can be accelerated by using lower bounds such as LB_Keogh, LB_Improved, or LB_Petitjean. However, the Early Abandon and Pruned DTW algorithm reduces the degree of acceleration that lower bounding provides and sometimes renders it ineffective.

In a survey, Wang et al. reported slightly better results with the LB_Improved lower bound than the LB_Keogh bound, and found that other techniques were inefficient. Subsequent to this survey, the LB_Enhanced bound was developed that is always tighter than LB_Keogh while also being more efficient to compute. LB_Petitjean is the tightest known lower bound that can be computed in linear time.

== Average sequence ==
Averaging for dynamic time warping is the problem of finding an average sequence for a set of sequences. 
NLAAF is an exact method to average two sequences using DTW.
For more than two sequences, the problem is related to the one of the multiple alignment and requires heuristics.
DBA is currently a reference method to average a set of sequences consistently with DTW.
COMASA efficiently randomizes the search for the average sequence, using DBA as a local optimization process.

== Supervised learning ==

A nearest-neighbour classifier can achieve state-of-the-art performance when using dynamic time warping as a distance measure.

== Amerced Dynamic Time Warping ==

Amerced Dynamic Time Warping (ADTW) is a variant of DTW designed to better control DTW&#x27;s permissiveness in the alignments that it allows. The windows that classical DTW uses to constrain alignments introduce a step function. Any warping of the path is allowed within the window and none beyond it. In contrast, ADTW employs an additive penalty that is incurred each time that the path is warped. Any amount of warping is allowed, but each warping action incurs a direct penalty. ADTW significantly outperforms DTW with windowing when applied as a nearest neighbor classifier on a set of benchmark time series classification tasks.

== Alternative approaches ==

In functional data analysis, time series are regarded as discretizations of smooth (differentiable) functions of time. By viewing the observed samples at smooth functions, one can utilize continuous mathematics for analyzing data. Smoothness and monotonicity of time warp functions may be obtained for instance by integrating a time-varying radial basis function, thus being a one-dimensional diffeomorphism. Optimal nonlinear time warping functions are computed by minimizing a measure of distance of the set of functions to their warped average. Roughness penalty terms for the warping functions may be added, e.g., by constraining the size of their curvature. The resultant warping functions are smooth, which facilitates further processing. This approach has been successfully applied to analyze patterns and variability of speech movements.

Another related approach are hidden Markov models (HMM) and it has been shown that the Viterbi algorithm used to search for the most likely path through the HMM is equivalent to stochastic DTW.

DTW and related warping methods are typically used as pre- or post-processing steps in data analyses. If the observed sequences contain both random variation in both their values, shape of observed sequences and random temporal misalignment, the warping may overfit to noise leading to biased results. A simultaneous model formulation with random variation in both values (vertical) and time-parametrization (horizontal) is an example of a nonlinear mixed-effects model. In human movement analysis, simultaneous nonlinear mixed-effects modeling has been shown to produce superior results compared to DTW.

==Applications==

===Spoken-word recognition===
Due to different speaking rates, a non-linear fluctuation occurs in speech pattern versus time axis, which needs to be eliminated. DP matching is a pattern-matching algorithm based on dynamic programming (DP), which uses a time-normalization effect, where the fluctuations in the time axis are modeled using a non-linear time-warping function. Considering any two speech patterns, we can get rid of their timing differences by warping the time axis of one so that the maximal coincidence is attained with the other. Moreover, if the warping function is allowed to take any possible value, distinction can be made between words belonging to different categories. So, to enhance the distinction between words belonging to different categories, restrictions were imposed on the warping function slope.

===Correlation power analysis===
Unstable clocks are used to defeat naive power analysis. Several techniques are used to counter this defense, one of which is dynamic time warping.

=== Finance and econometrics ===
Dynamic time warping is used in finance and econometrics to assess the quality of the prediction versus real-world data.

<text>William James Te Wehi Taitoko (17 January 1948 – 7 August 1991), better known by his stage name Billy T. James, was a New Zealand entertainer, comedian, musician and actor. He became a key figure in the development of New Zealand comedy and was a household name during his lifetime.

==Early life==
Billy grew up as William James Te Wehi Taitoko, first in the Waikato town of Leamington (now part of Cambridge), then in Whangārei. At high school, he sang and played guitar in a band. Popular for drawing caricatures of his teachers, Billy began an apprenticeship as a signwriter after leaving school.

In his mid 20s, Billy T. was invited to join showband the Māori Volcanics, and was soon performing around the world, echoing the path of entertainers John Rowles and Frankie Stevens. He quickly showed his skills as impressionist, comedian, guitarist and saxophone-player. While living in Australia Billy went solo, dropping his Taitoko surname, and rearranging his birth names to &quot;something the Aussies could pronounce&quot;.

Taitoko was of Waikato Tainui and Clan Campbell descent.

==Career==
Taitoko joined the Maori Volcanics Showband in the 1970s and performed around the world. Prince Tui Teka encouraged him to embark on a solo career which saw him in great demand for his skits and impressions and his cabaret singing. He adopted the stage name Billy T. James because &quot;it was something the Australians could pronounce&quot;.

In 1980, he appeared on the variety show &quot;Radio Times&quot;, the success of which led to his own comedy sketch show in 1981 called The Billy T James Show. The same year he was named New Zealand Entertainer of the Year.

In 1985, his cabaret act was recorded live and released on LP as &quot;Billy T Live! at Pips Cabaret, Whangarei&quot;. Featuring standup comedy selections and live versions of songs such as &quot;Running Bear&quot; and &quot;When A Child Is Born&quot;, this title was out-of-print for more than a decade before being re-released in CD format in 2008.

Taitoko made a notable appearance in the 1985 feature film &quot;Came a Hot Friday&quot; and provided voice talent for the popular animated film &quot;Footrot Flats: The Dog&#x27;s Tail&quot;. Also in 1985, James was named New Zealand Entertainer of the Decade.

In the 1986 New Year Honours, James was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to entertainment.

In 1986, James and Chris Slane published &quot;Real Hard Case&quot; which contained comic-strip interpretations of Taitoko&#x27;s comedy. &quot;Real Hard Case 2&quot; followed in 1987.

During this period, Taitoko name and likeness were used for the company &quot;Billy T&#x27;s Hangi Takeaways,&quot; with locations in Auckland, but the business did not last and closed after several years.

In 1990, Taitoko received the prestigious Benny Award from the Variety Artists Club of New Zealand Inc for a lifetime of excellence in the performing arts. That year, he was also awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.

==&quot;The Billy T James Show&quot;==
Billy T. James&#x27; self-titled television show for TVNZ featured sketch comedy and live performances of standup comedy and songs. The show lasted seven series and became a New Zealand institution. Joining Taitoko in the first series were regulars Doug Aston and Laurie Dee. Almost all of the first (1981) and second series (1982) are lost; only one episode from the first two series still exists in the TVNZ archive. The second series saw James introduce his first recurring character Pierre the Painter who would paint pictures while telling a story. The third series, the first to survive in full, saw the introduction of a parody of the Maori news show &quot;Te Karere&quot; entitled &quot;Te News&quot; in Episode 3, however, this would not appear again until two years later during Series 5. The black singlet and yellow towel James wore in these sketches were to become iconic. After the 1984 series, Doug Aston and Laurie Dee, along with many of the writers, were dropped. The fifth and sixth series (1985 and 1986) were co-written by Peter Rowley and included parodies of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, &quot;Playschool,&quot; a &#x27;Lands For Bags&#x27; television commercial, and sketches featuring Rowley as Captain Cook.

Series 1 and 2 most likely ran for 6 half-hour episodes each in 1981 and 1982. Series 3 ran for 7 half-hour episodes in 1983, and Series 4 ran for 6 half-hour episodes in 1984.

Later, Taitoko starred in a second television show, also titled &quot;The Billy T James Show&quot;. It screened on TV3 in 1990 and was based on a format devised by James and Tom Parkinson. Abandoning the popular sketch comedy format, this show was a family sitcom format and starred James as himself. Co-starring were Ilona Rodgers and Mark Hadlow, with Mark Wright, Tania Wehi, and Willa O&#x27;Neill. It ran for one series with only average audience ratings and reviews.

==Deteriorating health, transplant and death==
In 1988, Taitoko suffered a major heart attack and underwent a quadruple bypass operation. The operation was not successful, and in November 1989 he received a heart transplant, one of the first to be performed in New Zealand. He returned to the stage of the Aotea Centre in April 1990 for the variety special &quot;Billy T James, Alive and Gigging&quot;. Howard Morrison appeared as a special guest.

Taitoko&#x27;s health deteriorated again shortly afterwards, and he became ill with heart failure in February 1991. He died at Green Lane Hospital in Auckland on 7 August 1991.

Billy is survived by his daughter Cherie James, an actress and presenter of the 1997 documentary &quot;A Daughter&#x27;s Story&quot;, about her father.

==Legacy, recent biographies and documentaries==
The Billy T Award was founded in 1997 in honour of James, recognising comedians with outstanding potential. Winners are presented with a yellow towel, Billy&#x27;s trademark from his &quot;Te News&quot; sketches.

In 2009, nearly 50% of respondents voted him the country&#x27;s greatest comedian in a &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot; survey, eighteen years after his death.

The first biography of James was released in 2009. Entitled &quot;The Life and Times of Billy T. James&quot;, it was written by Matt Elliott and was based upon interviews with more than fifty friends and colleagues of Billy as well as his wife Lynn and sister Ngaire.

In December 2010, funding was given for the production of a biographical film based on Billy T. James&#x27; life. In March 2011, it was revealed the film was to be titled &quot;Billy&quot;, and would star Tainui Tukiwaho as James and Morgana O&#x27;Reilly as wife Lynn. The film premiered on 21 August 2011 on TV One. Liberties were taken for dramatic purposes, including arguments with co-writer and television partner Peter Rowley and a minor heart attack while filming, neither of which occurred. Both Peter Rowley and James&#x27; daughter criticised the inaccuracies of the production in the press.

A documentary entitled &quot;Billy T: Te Movie&quot; was released theatrically in August 2011. Directed by Ian Mune, it proved popular with both theatre-goers and reviewers, becoming the week&#x27;s top box office performer on the week of release with $263,000 in sales. &quot;Te Movie&quot; is now available on DVD.

In 2011, Peter Rowley wrote and starred in &quot;Billy T &amp; Me&quot;, a one-man show which combined Rowley&#x27;s memories of working alongside James with archival video footage. The show toured New Zealand and was made available on DVD.

In late 2021 James&#x27; family listed many of his personal belongings on auction site TradeMe. Included were his personal scrapbooks, musical instruments and the awards presented to him during his career. The auctions received much interest and coverage in the New Zealand media.

<doc id="342865" wikidata="Q378727" url="?curid=342865" title="Tim Buckley">
<text>Timothy Charles Buckley III (February 14, 1947 – June 29, 1975) was an American musician. He began his career based in folk rock, but subsequently experimented with genres such as psychedelia, jazz, the avant-garde, and funk paired with his unique five-octave vocal range. 

His commercial peak came with the 1969 album &quot;Happy Sad&quot;, reaching No. 81 on the charts, while his experimental 1970 album &quot;Starsailor&quot; went on to become a cult classic. The latter contained his best known song, &quot;Song to the Siren.&quot; 

Buckley died at the age of 28 from a heroin and morphine overdose. He left behind one biological son, Jeff, who himself was a highly regarded singer who died young, as well as an adopted son, Taylor.

== Early life and career ==
Tim Buckley was born in Washington, D.C., on Valentine&#x27;s Day, February 14, 1947, to Elaine (née Scalia), an Italian American, and Timothy Charles Buckley Jr., a decorated World War II veteran and son of Irish immigrants from Cork. He has a sister named Kathleen. He spent his early childhood in Amsterdam, New York, an industrial city about northwest of Albany. At five years old, Buckley began listening to his mother&#x27;s progressive jazz recordings, particularly Miles Davis.

Buckley&#x27;s musical life began after his family moved to Bell Gardens in southern California in 1956. His grandmother introduced him to the work of Bessie Smith and Billie Holiday, his mother to Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland and his father to the country music of Hank Williams and Johnny Cash. When the folk music revolution came around in the early 1960s, Buckley taught himself the banjo at age 13, and with several friends formed a folk group inspired by The Kingston Trio that played local high school events.

During high school, Buckley was elected to class offices, played on the baseball team and quarterbacked the football team. During a football game, he broke two fingers on his left hand, permanently damaging them. He said that the injury prevented him from playing barre chords. This disability may have led to his use of extended chords, many of which don&#x27;t require barres.

Buckley attended Loara High School in Anaheim, California. He cut classes regularly and quit football, focusing most of his attention on music. He befriended Larry Beckett, his future lyricist, and Jim Fielder, a bass player with whom he formed two musical groups, the Bohemians, who initially played popular music, and the Harlequin 3, a folk group which regularly incorporated spoken word and beat poetry into their gigs.

Buckley and lyricist/friend Beckett wrote dozens of songs, some that appeared on Tim&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Tim Buckley&quot;. &quot;Buzzin&#x27; Fly&quot; was written during this period and was featured on &quot;Happy Sad&quot;, his 1969 LP.

Buckley&#x27;s college career at Fullerton College lasted two weeks in 1965. After dropping out of college, Buckley dedicated himself fully to music and playing L.A. folk clubs. During the summer of 1965, he played regularly at a club co-founded by Dan Gordon. He played Orange County coffeehouses such as the White Room in Buena Park and the Monday-night hootenannies at the Los Angeles Troubadour. That year, &quot;Cheetah&quot; magazine deemed Buckley one of &quot;The Orange County Three&quot;, along with Steve Noonan and Jackson Browne.

In February 1966, following a gig at It&#x27;s Boss, the Mothers of Invention&#x27;s drummer Jimmy Carl Black recommended Buckley to the Mothers&#x27; manager, Herb Cohen. Cohen saw potential in Tim and landed him an extended gig at the Night Owl Cafe in Greenwich Village at West 3rd and MacDougal. Buckley&#x27;s girlfriend, Jainie Goldstein, drove him to New York. While living in the Bowery with Jainie, Buckley ran into Lee Underwood and asked him to play guitar for him. The two became lifelong friends and collaborators.

Under Cohen&#x27;s management, Buckley recorded a six-song demo acetate disc which he sent to Elektra records owner Jac Holzman, who offered him a recording contract.

== Folk rock ==
In August 1966, Buckley recorded his self-titled debut album in three days in Los Angeles. He later recalled: &quot;I was only 19, and going into the studio was like Disneyland. I&#x27;d do anything anybody said.&quot; The record featured Buckley and a band of Underwood and Orange County friends. Underwood&#x27;s mix of jazz and country improvisation on a Telecaster guitar became a distinctive part of Buckley&#x27;s early sound. Jac Holzman and Paul Rothchild&#x27;s production and Jack Nitzsche&#x27;s string arrangements cemented the record&#x27;s mid-&#x27;60s sound.

The album&#x27;s folk-rock style was typical of the time, although many people, including Underwood, felt the strings by Nitzsche &quot;did not enhance its musical quality.&quot; Critics took note of Buckley&#x27;s distinctive voice and tuneful compositions.

Underwood considered the record to be &quot;a first effort, naive, stiff, quaky and innocent [but] a ticket into the marketplace&quot;. Holzman expressed similar sentiments and thought Buckley wasn&#x27;t comfortable in his own musical skin. Larry Beckett suggested the band&#x27;s desire to please audiences held it back.

Elektra released two singles promoting the debut album, &quot;Wings&quot; with &quot;Grief in My Soul&quot; as the B-side, and &quot;Aren&#x27;t You the Girl&quot;/&quot;Strange Street Affair Under Blue.&quot; Buckley followed with &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; and &quot;Lady Give Me Your Key&quot;, which were not well regarded but showed potential. Elektra decided not to release the songs as singles, and the songs remained in Elektra&#x27;s record vaults. Rhino Records was unable to find &quot;Lady Give Me Your Key&quot; to include on its &quot;Morning Glory: The Tim Buckley Anthology&quot;, but the song was the title track on Light in the Attic Records&#x27; 2017 collection of the previously unissued 1967 acoustic sessions. &quot;Once Upon A Time&quot; surfaced on Rhino&#x27;s &quot;Where The Action Is 1965–68 Los Angeles&quot; anthology in 2009.

&quot;Goodbye and Hello&quot;, released in 1967, featured late 1960s-style poetry and songs in different timings, and was an ambitious release for the 20-year-old Buckley. Reflecting the confidence Elektra had in Buckley and group, they were given free rein on the content of the album. Beckett continued as lyricist and the album consisted of Buckley originals and Beckett–Buckley collaborations. Critics noted the improved lyrical and melodic qualities of Buckley&#x27;s music. Buckley&#x27;s voice had developed since his last release and the press appreciated both his lower register and falsetto in equal measure.


The subject of the album distinguished it from its predecessor. Beckett addressed the psychological nature of war in &quot;No Man Can Find the War&quot;, and Underwood welcomed Buckley&#x27;s entry into darker territory with &quot;Pleasant Street&quot;. &quot;I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain&quot; represented a confessional lyric to his estranged wife and child, while the mix of introspective folk songs and political-themed content attracted folk fans and anti-war audiences. Holzman had faith in Buckley and rented advertising space for the musician on the Sunset Strip, an unusual step for a solo act. Buckley distanced himself from comparisons to Bob Dylan, expressing an apathy toward Dylan and his work. While &quot;Goodbye and Hello&quot; did not make Buckley a star, it performed better in the charts than his previous effort, peaking at No. 171.

Buckley&#x27;s higher profile led to his album &quot;The Best of Tim Buckley&quot; being used as a soundtrack to the 1969 film &quot;Changes&quot;. Buckley performed &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; on the final episode of &quot;The Monkees&quot;. Buckley was wary of the press and often avoided interviews. After a slot on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Buckley was standoffish and insulting toward Johnny Carson, and on another television appearance refused to lip sync to &quot;Pleasant Street&quot;.

After Beckett was drafted into the Army, Buckley developed his own style, and described the jazz/blues-rock with which he was associated as &quot;white thievery and an emotional sham.&quot; Drawing inspiration from jazz greats such as Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, Roland Kirk, and vocalist Leon Thomas, Buckley&#x27;s sound became different from previous recordings.

In 1968, Buckley toured Europe twice, first including Denmark, the Netherlands, and England, appearing e.g. on John Peel&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; radio show on the BBC and then appearing at the in Germany, as well as touring England and Denmark again. Later that year, he recorded &quot;Happy Sad&quot;, which reflected folk and jazz influences and would be his best-charting album, peaking at No. 81.

== Middle period ==
During 1969, Buckley began to write and record material for three albums, &quot;Blue Afternoon&quot;, &quot;Lorca&quot;, and &quot;Starsailor&quot;. Inspired by the singing of avant-garde musician Cathy Berberian, he integrated the ideas of composers such as Luciano Berio and Iannis Xenakis in an avant-garde rock genre. Buckley selected eight songs for &quot;Blue Afternoon&quot;, an album similar to &quot;Happy Sad&quot; in style. In a 1977 article for &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine, Lee Underwood wrote that Buckley&#x27;s heart was not in &quot;Blue Afternoon&quot; and that the album was a perfunctory response to please his business partners.

While Buckley&#x27;s music never sold well, his following releases did indeed chart. &quot;Lorca&quot; alienated his folk base, while &quot;Blue Afternoon&quot; was criticized as boring and tepid, and &quot;[not] even good sulking music&quot;, although it has been re-evaluated over the years. &quot;Blue Afternoon&quot; was Buckley&#x27;s last album to chart on &quot;Billboard&quot;, reaching No. 192. Following the albums, Buckley began to focus on what he felt to be his masterpiece, &quot;Starsailor&quot;.

&quot;Starsailor&quot; contained free jazz textures under Buckley&#x27;s most extreme vocal performance, ranging from high shrieks to deep, soulful baritone. This personal album included the more accessible &quot;Song to the Siren&quot;, a song which has since been covered by Robert Plant, John Frusciante, Bryan Ferry, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and Brendan Perry. The album was a critical and commercial failure upon release, despite having gained a considerable cult status following This Mortal Coil&#x27;s cover, which renewed interest in it.

Unable to produce his music and almost broke, Buckley turned to alcohol and drug binges. He considered acting and completed an unreleased low-budget film entitled &quot;Why?&quot; (1971). The film was an experimental use of the new medium video tape and was commissioned by Technicolor.

== &quot;Sex funk&quot; period ==

In 1970, Buckley disbanded his &quot;Starsailor&quot; ensemble and assembled a new funk band. He cut three albums, &quot;Greetings from L.A.&quot;, &quot;Sefronia&quot; and &quot;Look at the Fool&quot;. Buckley had alienated much of his hippie fan base with his previous two albums, and his sexually frank lyrics (&quot;whip me, spank me&quot;) prevented the songs from receiving airplay, although he retained a cult following.

In 1975, Buckley engaged the press regarding a live album comeback. He began performing revamped versions of material drawn from his career, except &quot;Starsailor&quot; and &quot;Lorca,&quot; in response to his audience, which he had spurned in the past.

== Death ==
On June 28, 1975, Buckley completed a short tour with a show in Dallas, playing to a sold-out crowd of 1,800 people. He celebrated the end of the tour with a weekend of drinking with his band and friends. On the evening of June 29, he accompanied longtime friend Richard Keeling to his house. At some point, Keeling produced a bag of heroin, some of which Buckley snorted.

Buckley&#x27;s friends took him home and, seeing his inebriated state, his wife Judy laid him on the living-room floor and questioned his friends as to what had happened. She moved Buckley into bed. When she checked on him later, she found that he was not breathing and had turned blue. Attempts by friends and paramedics to revive him were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead on arrival.

The coroner&#x27;s report stated that Buckley died at 9:42 p.m. on June 29, 1975, from &quot;acute heroin/morphine and ethanol intoxication due to inhalation and ingestion of overdose&quot;.

=== Aftermath ===
Buckley&#x27;s tour manager, Bob Duffy, said Buckley&#x27;s death was not expected, but &quot;was like watching a movie, and that was its natural ending.&quot;

Other friends saw his passing as predictable, if not inevitable. Beckett recalled how Buckley took chances with his life, including dangerous driving, drinking alcohol, taking pills and heroin.

Given the circumstances of his death, police charged Keeling with murder and distribution of heroin. At his hearing on August 14, 1975, Keeling pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and, after failing to complete community service, was sentenced to 120 days in jail and four years&#x27; probation.

Buckley died in debt, owning only a guitar and an amplifier. About 200 friends and family attended his funeral at the Wilshire Funeral Home in Santa Monica, including manager Herb Cohen and Lee Underwood. His 8-year-old son, Jeff, had met his father only once, and was not invited to the funeral. Jeff Buckley said not being invited to his father&#x27;s funeral &quot;gnawed&quot; at him, and prompted him to pay his respects by performing &quot;I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain&quot; in 1991 at a memorial tribute to Buckley in Brooklyn.

==Personal life==
During French class in 1964, Buckley met Mary Guibert. Their relationship inspired some of Buckley&#x27;s music, and provided both of them time away from their respective turbulent home lives. After almost a year of dating, Buckley and Guibert married on October 25, 1965. When Guibert became pregnant, Buckley decided he was unable to cope with fatherhood. The couple divorced in October 1966, about a month before their son, Jeff Buckley, was born. Jeff later said about his father, &quot;He left my mother when I was six months old... So I never really knew him at all. We were born with the same parts but when I sing it&#x27;s me. This is my own time and if people expect me to work the same things for them as he did, they&#x27;re going to be disappointed.&quot;

In April 1970, Buckley married Judy Brejot Sutcliffe in Santa Monica, and adopted her son, Taylor Keith Sutcliffe.

<text>Soho House is a museum run by Birmingham Museums Trust, celebrating Matthew Boulton&#x27;s life, his partnership with James Watt, his membership of the Lunar Society of Birmingham and his contribution to the Midlands Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. It is a Grade II* listed 18th-century house in Handsworth, part of Birmingham since 1911, but historically in the county of Staffordshire. It was the home of entrepreneur Matthew Boulton from 1766 until his death in 1809, and a regular meeting-place of the Lunar Society.

==History==
Matthew Boulton, one of the 18th century&#x27;s most significant entrepreneurs, acquired the lease of the five-year-old Soho Mill in 1761 and developed it into Soho Manufactory. He expanded the cottage next to it into Soho House, changing it several times. It is faced with sheets of painted slate to give the appearance of large stone blocks. Boulton moved into Soho House when the Manufactory was completed. The Soho Manufactory was demolished in 1863.

In 1766, Boulton became one of the founders of the Lunar Society. In 1789, Boulton commissioned Samuel Wyatt to extend the buildings and fully revamp it and the gardens. Work on extending the building was completed in 1796 following the submission of designs by James Wyatt, Samuel&#x27;s brother, for the additions of a main entrance front. Wyatt was also responsible for the large dining room, the regular venue for meetings of the Lunar Society. It is a Grade II* listed building.

After Boulton&#x27;s death, in the house, it passed to his son Matthew Robinson Boulton and later his grandson, Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, who eventually sold it in 1850. It then had a number of owners, and was at one time used as a residential hostel for police officers, before being acquired by Birmingham City Council in 1990 and being opened by them as a museum in 1995.

==Features==

Soho House has been restored, retaining its 18th-century appearance, with &quot;fine collections of ormolu, silver, furniture and paintings&quot;. Of particular note are the displays of silver and ormolu which were made in the manufactory, and the ormolu Sidereal clock made by Boulton and Fothergill, in 1771–72. There is a Blue Plaque commemorating Matthew Boulton on the house. The garden, once over 100 acres in size but now less than half an acre, contains a walk with sphinxes, dated to around 1795. Part of the garden has been recreated using Boulton&#x27;s original planting notes.

==Museum==
Soho House is a &quot;Heritage Site&quot; and branch museum of the Birmingham Museums &amp; Art Gallery, owned by Birmingham City Council. Since April 2012 the Heritage Sites and all other museums formerly run by the council have been run by Birmingham Museums Trust. It hosts exhibitions of local and community interest. Previously free, since April 2011 admission charges apply for entry to the house. It remains free to under 16s. Gardens, grounds and visitor facilities are free to all visitors. Artists-in-residence at the house have included Vanley Burke and Pauline Bailey.

<text>Ungjin, also known as Gomanaru (Hangul: 고마나루, literally &quot;bear port&quot;) is a former city on the Korean Peninsula. It was located in modern-day Gongju, South Chungcheong province, South Korea. It was the capital of Baekje from AD 475 to 538, during a period when Baekje was under threat from Goguryeo, the previous capital of Wiryeseong (modern-day Seoul) having been overrun. In 538, King Seong moved the capital to Sabi (in modern-day Buyeo County). Ungjin is now known as Gongju.

Notable historical places of Ungjin Baekje are Gongsan Fortress and Tomb of King Muryeong.

==History==
In 475, Baekje had an attack by Gogureyo army led by King Jangsu, and then Wiryeseong, the first capital of Baekje, was destroyed. Baekje&#x27;s new king, Munju, moved its capital to Ungjin.

During the reign of King Muryeong, kingdom recovered its political stability, and diplomacy ties with Liang dynasty of China and Japan. Baekje brought Chinese culture, and introduced it to Silla, Gaya, and Japan.

Ungjin maintained its position until transfer of the capital in 538 by King Seong. Ungjin period regarded as a time of restored its national power and stability for revival.

<text>Buyeo County () is a county in South Chungcheong Province, South Korea. Buyeo-eup, the county&#x27;s capital, was the site of the capital of Baekje from 538-660 AD, during which it was called Sabi Fortress.

Famous people associated with Buyeo County in more recent times include noted stem-cell researcher Hwang Woo-suk.

==Geography==

Buyeo is located at the southern area of Chungcheongnam-do, the heart of the Korean peninsula.

During the Three Kingdoms Era, the capital of Baekje was moved to present-day Buyeo-eup (then called Sabi) on account of crowding in the former capital, which was near present-day Seoul. A fortress called Garimseong was constructed for defending the new capital. Buyeo County has numerous historical sites from this era, such as the mountain fortresses (&quot;sanseong&quot;) at Seongheung, Buso, and Cheong, the tumuli at Neungsan-ri, and the temple site at Gunsu-ri, all designated Historic Sites of South Korea.

==Commerce==
It wasn&#x27;t until the early 2000s that Lotteria moved into the area, but in recent years it has become home to a variety of franchises.

As a traditional city, many coffee shops are built in the style of hanoks or have a Hanok concept.

On 8 September 2013, a new Lotte Outlet Buyeo branch was opened in Gyuram-myeon.

From 1965, the province officially announced to take place Baekje cultural memorial.

The festival showcases traditional costumes and marching from the Baekje era, focusing on the works of the six kings of the Sabi era and the story of the loyalty of three subjects. This festival was ranked among the best in the country in 2007.

<doc id="342870" wikidata="Q42062" url="?curid=342870" title="Gongju">
<text>Gongju (; ) is a city in South Chungcheong Province, South Korea.

== History ==
Gongju was formerly named Ungjin and was the capital of Baekje from AD 475 to 538. In this period, Baekje was under threat from Goguryeo. Goguryeo had overrun the previous capital of Hanseong (modern-day Seoul), which forced Baekje to find a new center of strength.

In 538, King Seong moved the capital to Sabi (in modern-day Buyeo County). However, Gongju remained an important center until the kingdom&#x27;s fall in 660.

=== New capital ===
On August 11, 2004, the South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan announced that the country&#x27;s capital will be moved from Seoul to Gongju (approximately south of Seoul) and Yeongi commencing in 2007. A site was chosen for the project, which was scheduled to be completed by 2030. It was envisaged that government and administrative functions will move to the new capital, along with (possibly) the National Assembly and supreme court, although no sizable relocation was expected until the first phase of the project has been completed by 2012. 

The move was intended to reduce Seoul&#x27;s overcrowding and economic dominance over the rest of South Korea; perhaps not coincidentally, it would have also moved the government and administration out of range of North Korean artillery fire.

The projected cost of the project ranged from $45bn to as much as $94bn. 

The plan has aroused controversy, with opposition parties calling for a referendum to see whether it is endorsed by the population. Some civic groups have also launched a constitutional appeal, and on October 21, 2004, the Constitutional Court ruled that the special law for the relocation of the capital is unconstitutional since the relocation is a serious national matter requiring national referendum or revision of the constitution, thus effectively ending the dispute. Opinion polls showed that a slight majority of South Koreans are opposed to the move, both before and after the ruling. 

However, late in 2004, the government announced yet another plan that will allow Seoul to be a capital in name only by retaining the Executive Branch, all Legislature Branch, and Judiciary Branch in Seoul, while moving all other branches of government to Gongju. The question remains unresolved to date.

==Climate==
Gongju has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;), using the isotherm. It has a mountainous climate in which temperature is drastically different in the day and at night. Annual average temperature is 10.8 °C, and the highest temperature of the year is 35 °C and the lowest -17 °C. Annual average precipitation is 1,251mm, and Namdae Stream, a branch stream of Geum River, is flowing through Muju-eup.

<doc id="342873" wikidata="Q1544221" url="?curid=342873" title="Great Barr Hall">
<text>Great Barr Hall is an 18th-century mansion situated in the Great Barr district of Pheasey, Walsall, West Midlands, England. It has associations with the Lunar Society and is a Grade II listed building. It is, however, in a very poor state of repair and is on the Buildings at Risk Register.

==History==
===The Scotts===
In the mid-17th century, Richard Scott acquired the house then standing on the site and known as Nether House. In about 1777, Joseph Scott (later Sir Joseph Scott, 1st Baronet Scott of Great Barr) replaced the old house with a two-storey, nine-bay mansion in the Strawberry Hill Gothic Revival style. The house was much altered and extended about 1840 and in 1863, an adjacent chapel (which was never consecrated) was erected to a design probably of architect George Gilbert Scott, a friend – but not a relation – of Sir Francis Scott. Two of the extant lodge houses are believed to be by George Gilbert Scott.

Outside the chapel are the burial plots of several of Lady Bateman Scott&#x27;s pets, inscribed with poems she wrote for them.

Financial problems led the Scott Family (who gave their name to the nearby Scott Arms pub and shopping centre), to lease out the hall from about 1788 to Samuel Galton, and for some years the Hall became a venue for meetings of the Lunar Society. It is said to be the &#x27;favourite place of meeting&#x27; of this illustrious body. In 1999, stone memorials to the Lunar Society, the &quot;Moonstones&quot;, were erected at the nearby Asda supermarket.

In 1791, Sir Francis Scott, 3rd Baronet, inherited the manor of Great Barr from his maternal uncle Thomas Hoo and was able to return to live in the house on the expiry of the lease. He died in 1863. His widow Mildred lived on in the Hall until her death in 1909.

===After the Scotts===

In 1911, the estate was purchased by a local hospital board and, in 1918, became The Great Barr Park Colony for &#x27;mental defectives, in 1948 it became St Margaret&#x27;s Mental Hospital. Many detached hospital buildings were erected near the hall, and in the 1980s the grounds became a nature reserve, managed by the Staffordshire Nature Conservation Trust but the hall itself was abandoned in 1978 and, despite its 1971 Grade II* listing, was left to decay. The hospital began to close in phases from the late 1980s. The male department closed during 1992 but the female department closed in March 1997. The final residents, those with high dependency, left a newer part of the site in 2004.

This also included a special school, The Queslett School, which closed in December 1988.

Many years passed during which discussions and negotiations for the protection of the hall came to nothing. In 2006, Bovis Homes purchased the 40 hectare estate and obtained planning permission for the redevelopment of the site. Nether Hall Park a new residential housing development, occupying a substantial part of the estate, was completed in the 2010s.

In May 2011 the hall, still in ruins, was put up for sale for £2.2 million, by the Manor Building Preservation Trust, who had been allowed to purchase it nine years earlier for £900,000. The trust had failed to bring it back into a safe state. It failed to sell, and so was offered for sale by auction on 6 February 2012, by Van Weenan Estate Agents of London, with a guide price of £1,250,000. The highest bid was £1,140,000, and so it again remained unsold. In May 2012, it was sold to a consortium of ten local residents. They have commissioned Lapworth Architects to consult with the public and investigate potential new uses for the hall.

The hall is on English Heritage&#x27;s &quot;Buildings at Risk Register&quot;.

== Lodges ==

The Hall had six lodges, or gatehouses. Three survive:

* Avenue Lodge, on Chapel Lane ()
* Handsworth Lodge, where Handsworth Drive meets Queslett Road ()
* Walsall Lodge (formerly Shustoke Lodge, now known as Merrions Wood Lodge), on Birmingham Road; designed by George Gilbert Scott in 1858 ()

and three are lost:

* Beacon Lodge, on Beacon Road, near the junction with Waverly Avenue (approx. )
* Church Lodge, opposite Avenue Lodge across Chapel Lane (approx. )
* Queslett Lodge, near where Queslett Road meets Beacon Road (approx. )

==Lakes==

A pair of large, man-made lakes—now known as Great Barr Hall Upper Lake and Great Barr Hall Lower Lake—are in the grounds of the hall, on two levels, separated by a cascade which is crossed by stepping stones. The upper lake is fed by a stream, the Holbrook, which leaves the lower lake at the southern end, and runs, via Perry Reservoir, to the River Tame, very near the Zig Zag Bridge at Perry Barr. From there, its waters flow, via the Trent, to the Humber and the North Sea.

<doc id="342876" wikidata="Q4767328" url="?curid=342876" title="Anna Maxwell">
<text>Anna Caroline Maxwell (March 14, 1851January 2, 1929), was a nurse who came to be known as &quot;the American Florence Nightingale&quot;. Her pioneering activities were crucial to the growth of professional nursing in the United States.

==Early years==
Maxwell was born in Bristol, New York on March 14, 1851. Her father was a Scottish emigrant, clergyman John Eglinton Maxwell, and her mother was an American-born woman of English descent, Diantha Caroline Maxwell. The family moved to Canada for some of Maxwell&#x27;s childhood, returning in 1874. That year, she began nursing without formal training, as an assistant matron at New England Hospital. She left in 1876 and spent two years in England before enrolling at Boston City Hospital Training School for Nurses. She was attracted there by the renown of Linda Richards, one of America&#x27;s first nurses, who taught at the school.

== Career ==
In 1880 Maxwell was hired to start a training school at Montreal General Hospital, however she found it a frustratingly slow experience. She left after six months and travelled to Europe, where she visited a number of hospitals. She returned to America and in November 1881 she was offered the superintendency of the Training School for Nurses at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In 1889, she moved to New York to be director of nursing at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital, and from there became superintendent of nursing at the Presbyterian Hospital of New York from 1892 to 1921. Maxwell was also the first director of the Presbyterian Hospital&#x27;s nursing school, founded in 1892, which later became the Columbia University School of Nursing.

===Wartime activities===

During the Spanish–American War Maxwell requested permission to take trained nurses to military hospitals to care for casualties. She was sent to a field hospital in Chicamauga, Georgia, where she and her nurses encountered poor sanitation, widespread disease, and a high death rate. Maxwell and her nurses were able to improve the conditions significantly. There was also an outbreak of typhoid fever at a military training camp in the area, and Maxwell led 150 nurses in caring for over 600 cases, as well as cases of malaria and measles. The military was impressed with the nurses&#x27; achievements and in 1901, with Maxwell&#x27;s involvement, the United States Army Nurse Corps was established.

In World War I, she also worked to prepare nurses for active military service, and in 1916 travelled to Europe to visit hospitals at the fronts. France awarded her the Medaille de l&#x27;Hygiene Publique (Medal of Honor for Public Health) in recognition of her work. Following the war, Maxwell worked for nurses to be given a rank in the armed forces, which was achieved in 1920.

=== Other activities ===

In addition to her work in education and with the military, Maxwell co-wrote a textbook with Amy E. Pope entitled &quot;Practical Nursing&quot;. She was also a member of the American Society of Superintendents of Training Schools for Nurses (1893), which later developed into the National League for Nursing, and the Nurses&#x27; Associated Alumnae of the United States and Canada (1897), which later became the American Nurses Association. She was also a member of the International Council of Nurses (1899) and the American Red Cross Nursing Service (1899), and was involved in establishing the &quot;American Journal of Nursing&quot; and the Isabel Hampton Robb Scholarship Fund.

=== Recognition ===

The first building to open at the new Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in 1928 was the home for the university&#x27;s nursing school. It was named the &quot;Anna C. Maxwell Hall&quot; in her honor. The hall was razed in 1984 to make room for a new hospital building, and the university established an endowed professorship at the nursing school in Maxwell&#x27;s name. Maxwell was one of the first women buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Columbia University awarded her an honorary Master of Arts degree.

<text>Standard Delay Format (SDF) is an IEEE standard for the representation and interpretation of timing data for use at any stage of an electronic design process. It finds wide applicability in design flows, and forms an efficient bridge between dynamic timing analysis and static timing analysis.

It was originally developed as an OVI standard, and later modified into the IEEE format. Technically only the SDF version 4.0 onwards are IEEE formats.

It is an ASCII format that is represented in a tool and language independent way and includes path delays, timing constraint values, interconnect delays and high level technology parameters.

It has usually two sections: one for interconnect delays and the other for cell delays. 

SDF format can be used for back-annotation as well as forward-annotation.

<doc id="342894" wikidata="Q828155" url="?curid=342894" title="Krka National Park">
<text>Krka National Park () is one of the Croatian national parks, named after the river Krka (ancient Greek: &quot;Kyrikos&quot;) that it encloses. It is located along the middle-lower course of the Krka River in central Dalmatia, in Šibenik-Knin county, downstream Miljevci area, and just a few kilometers northeast of the city of Šibenik. It was formed to protect the Krka River and is intended primarily for scientific, cultural, educational, recreational, and tourism activities. It is the seventh national park in Croatia and was proclaimed a national park in 1985.

==Geography==
The Krka National Park is located entirely within the territory of Šibenik-Knin County and encompasses an area of 109 square kilometers along the Krka River: two kilometers downriver from Knin to Skradin and the lower part of the river Čikola. The Krka National Park is a spacious, largely unchanged region of exceptional and multifaceted natural value, and includes one or more preserved or insignificantly altered ecosystems. The Krka Waterfalls area has the second highest density of lavender in Europe, hence the high frequency of wasps and bees in the area.


==Environment==

===Flora===
The Krka National Park belongs to the Southern European (Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean) region. Due to its special position and the mosaic distribution of various types of habitats, it is characterized by exceptionally rich and varied flora and fauna.

860 species and subspecies of plants have been identified within the territory of the Krka National Park, including several endemic Illyrian-Adriatic species. Standing out are the stone bellflower, the chimney bellflower, the mullein inula, Dalmatian pellitory and the Illirian iris, which is found growing on the rocks. Other endemic plants growing in this hot and dry environment include the wolfen spurge, Adriatic violet, musk thistle, thorny centaurium, strawberry spurge and Bertolon&#x27;s sage. In the wet areas along the Krka and Čikola rivers and in the Krka river valley grow meadow squill, knotweed, European hornbeam, wood melick and lady orchid.

===Fauna===
Eighteen species of fish inhabit the Krka River, among which ten are endemic, making the Krka a natural landmark of the highest category. Brown trout and Dalmatian barbelgudgeon are a couple of fish that can be found in the ecosystem.

Patches of reeds, lakes formed along part of the river and swamped meadows abound in amphibians and birds, while thickets and stone quarries are home to reptiles.

The abundance of species of birds (222), the structure of the bird communities and the great significance of the Krka for spring and autumn migrations make it among the ornithologically most valuable regions of Europe. There are numerous birds of prey in the area, notable ones are: osprey, short-toed eagle, golden eagle, Bonelli&#x27;s eagle, lanner falcon and the peregrine falcon. Other birds of interest are Eurasian eagle-owl, European bee-eater and griffon vulture.

Among mammals, there are 18 species of bats, which are generally endangered or near extinction in the rest of Europe, long-fingered bat, the Daubenton&#x27;s bat, and the threatened European otter.

===Ria===
A ria is the mouth of a river that flows into the sea, created by the submergence of the riverbed after the rise of the Adriatic Sea level for 135 metres after the last quaternary glaciation. In the ria of the Krka River, seawater extends to the base of Skradinski buk. The ria of the Krka River is 23.5 kilometers in length.

This ria is considered an exceptional phenomenon, due to its lack of pollution and biological vitality. It is an area rich in shellfish, freshwater fish and saltwater fish.

==Tourism==

Krka National Park features several places of interest for visitors. The attractions and facilities available include various boardwalks, sightseeing tours and presentations, boat trips, souvenir shops, a museum, and restaurants. There are also several archeological remains of unpreserved fortresses in the park&#x27;s vicinity dating back to Roman times. They are Čučevo, Nečven, Bogočin, Ključica, and Burnum.

===Skradinski buk===

Skradinski buk is one of the most attractive parts of the park. It is a massive, clear, natural pool with high waterfalls at one end and cascades at the other. It is the lowest of the three sets of waterfalls formed along the Krka river. In an area 400 m in length and 100 m in width there are 17 waterfalls and the total difference in height between the first and the last falls is 47.7 m. Due to the wealth and variety of geomorphological forms, vegetation, and the various effects caused by the play of light on the whirlpools, Skradinski buk is considered to be one of the most beautiful calcium carbonate waterfalls in Europe.

The rate of flow is 43 m3 a second in winter, 18 m3 in summer, with an average of 55 cubic metres a second flowing down Skradinski buk annually. It is the largest travertine cascade system in Europe.

===Roški Slap===

Roški Slap, located near Miljevci, is the second most popular attraction of the Krka National Park in terms of numbers of visitors. It is the sixth waterfall of the river Krka. Around the whole location there is a walking trail with wonderful views. There is also a hiking trail. The location can be visited throughout the year. The easiest way to reach Roški Slap is to take one of the excursion boats operated by the Krka National Park, although the falls can also be reached with a public road.

===Monastery===

Inside the park is the island of Visovac which was founded during the reign of Louis I of Hungary (XIV century), home to the Roman Catholic Visovac Monastery founded by the Franciscans in 1445 near Miljevci village. The island can be visited by a boat tour from Skradinski buk. The park also includes the Serbian Eastern Orthodox Monastery Krka founded in 1345. The Krka monastery is a spiritual center of the Orthodox Dalmatian Eparchy (Diocese), and was first mentioned in written documents in the year 1402 as the pious endowment of Jelena Šubić, the sister of Serbian Emperor Dušan. The monastery was built and rebuilt until the late 18th century.

<doc id="342898" wikidata="Q217061" url="?curid=342898" title="Yser">
<text>The Yser ( , ; ) is a river that rises in French Flanders (the north of France), enters the Belgian province of West Flanders and flows through the &quot;Ganzepoot&quot; and into the North Sea at the town of Nieuwpoort.

The source of the Yser is in Buysscheure (&quot;Buisscheure&quot;), in the Nord department of northern France. It flows through Bollezeele (&quot;Bollezele&quot;), Esquelbecq (&quot;Ekelsbeke&quot;), and Bambecque (&quot;Bambeke&quot;). After approximately of its course, it leaves France and enters Belgium. It then flows through Diksmuide and out into the North Sea at Nieuwpoort.

During the Battle of the Yser in the First World War, by opening the sluices, part of the polder west of the Yser was flooded with seawater between Nieuwpoort and Diksmuide to provide an obstacle to the advancing German Army and keep westernmost Belgium safe from German occupation. The Yser river itself never overflowed its banks.

==Basin==

The basin covers 1101 km2 and is two-thirds located in Belgium. A ridge in France forms the watershed line with the Aa basin in the west; in the south and east, the West Flemish Hills and the Central West Flemish Hills form the boundary with the Lys basin; in the north, a line of dunes is the boundary with the North Sea coast.

The Yser rises west of Cassel in northern France and has two official sources, at Buisscheure and Lederzele. It is fed there by the Penebeek (Peene Becque), the Vuilebeek (Sale Becque) and the Herzele (Herzeele). The Zwijnebeek (Zwyne Becque) on the left bank and the Heidebeek (Ey Becque) on the right bank form the border between France and Belgium for a long time. In Belgium, the Poperinge canal, Kemmelbeek, Lovaart, Ieperlee and Handzamevaart join the river. The Yser flows into the North Sea at Nieuwpoort (B) via the Ganzepoot lock complex.

==History== 

The area between the Yser and the coast was Veurne-Ambacht in the Middle Ages. At the end of the 16th century this came into Spanish hands and a few settlements/forts were erected along the Yser against plundering by reformers from Ostend. These largely lost their function after the fall of Ostend in 1604. After the Peace of Aachen, Veurne came into French hands and the Yser formed a northern border of the French empire. Fortifications were built again, such as Fort Knokke. After the Treaty of Utrecht, the area belonged to the Austrian Netherlands. There were still some barrier towns in the area, but the Yser eventually lost its border function.

The river was part of the front line during World War I and was the scene of trench warfare, with the Belgian and German armies dug in along both sides of the river. The Belgian army was able to hold out here for the rest of the war after the Battle of the Yser in 1914 following the inundation of part of the Yser plain, at the suggestion of the Veurn investigating judge and with the cooperation of Karel Cogge and Hendrik Geeraert. Further inland, the Allied lines were manned by British and French troops. As in other places in the region, terrible scenes took place in which each other&#x27;s positions were taken and recaptured again and again at a high price in human lives. Along the Yser, several monuments and sites recall the war, including the Yser Tower and the Death March in Diksmuide.

In May 1940, the French and English allies blew up all the bridges and locks again.

==Etymology==

Like some other names in Flanders, the name IJzer is of Celtic origin, as the Celtic Menapii lived in the area before the Roman times (see also the Isar in Germany, the Jizera in Bohemia and the Isère in France) before assimilation by the Franks.

==Tributaries==

The main tributaries of the Yser are:
* Peene Becque (&quot;Penebeek&quot;)
* Sale Becque (&quot;Vuilebeek&quot;)
* Ey Becque (&quot;Heidebeek&quot;)
* Zwyne Becque (&quot;Zwijnebeek&quot;)
* Vleeterbeek

<doc id="342899" wikidata="Q860530" url="?curid=342899" title="Image (category theory)">
<text>In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the image of a morphism is a generalization of the image of a function.

== General definition ==
Given a category formula_1 and a morphism formula_2 in formula_3, the image
of formula_4 is a monomorphism formula_5 satisfying the following universal property:
#There exists a morphism formula_6 such that formula_7.
#For any object formula_8 with a morphism formula_9 and a monomorphism formula_10 such that formula_11, there exists a unique morphism formula_12 such that formula_13.

Remarks:
# such a factorization does not necessarily exist.
# formula_14 is unique by definition of formula_15 monic.
# formula_16, therefore formula_17 by formula_18 monic.
# formula_19 is monic.
# formula_13 already implies that formula_19 is unique.


The image of formula_4 is often denoted by formula_23 or formula_24.

Proposition: If formula_1 has all equalizers then the formula_14 in the factorization formula_27 of (1) is an epimorphism.

= v\, q&lt;/math&gt;.

This means that formula_28 and thus that formula_29 equalizes formula_30, whence formula_31.

== Second definition ==
In a category formula_1 with all finite limits and colimits, the image is defined as the equalizer formula_33 of the so-called cokernel pair formula_34, which is the cocartesian of a morphism with itself over its domain, which will result in a pair of morphisms formula_35, on which the equalizer is taken, i.e. the first of the following diagrams is cocartesian, and the second equalizing.


Remarks:
# Finite bicompleteness of the category ensures that pushouts and equalizers exist.
# formula_33 can be called regular image as formula_37 is a regular monomorphism, i.e. the equalizer of a pair of morphisms. (Recall also that an equalizer is automatically a monomorphism).
# In an abelian category, the cokernel pair property can be written formula_38 and the equalizer condition formula_39. Moreover, all monomorphisms are regular.

== Examples ==

In the category of sets the image of a morphism formula_40 is the inclusion from the ordinary image formula_41 to formula_42. In many concrete categories such as groups, abelian groups and (left- or right) modules, the image of a morphism is the image of the correspondent morphism in the category of sets.

In any normal category with a zero object and kernels and cokernels for every morphism, the image of a morphism formula_43 can be expressed as follows:

:im &quot;f&quot; = ker coker &quot;f&quot;

In an abelian category (which is in particular binormal), if &quot;f&quot; is a monomorphism then &quot;f&quot; = ker coker &quot;f&quot;, and so &quot;f&quot; = im &quot;f&quot;.

== Essential Image ==
A related notion to image is &quot;essential image.&quot;

A subcategory formula_44 of a (strict) category is said to be replete if for every formula_45, and for every isomorphism formula_46, both formula_47 and formula_48 belong to C. 

Given a functor formula_49 between categories, the smallest replete subcategory of the target n-category B containing the image of A under F.

<text>The 2006 Winter Paralympic Games (), the ninth Paralympic Winter Games, took place in Turin, Italy, from 10 to 19 March 2006. These were the first Winter Paralympic Games to be held in Italy. They were also the first Paralympics to use the new Paralympics logo.

Italy will host the Winter Paralympics again in 2026, scheduled to be held in Milan and Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo.

==Medal count==
The top 10 NPCs by number of gold medals are listed below. The host nation (Italy) is highlighted.
==Sports==
The Games featured 58 medal events in five disciplines of four sports. As with other Paralympic Games, medals are awarded for each classification within each event. The sport of wheelchair curling made its Paralympic debut at these games.
* 
* Nordic skiing
** 

==Venues==
Five competition venues were used during the Winter Paralympics. They all hosted competitions during the 2006 Winter Olympics.

The Opening ceremonies were held at Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino and the closing and the awarding ceremonies for the snow events were also held in Turin were held at the Medals Plaza at Piazza Castello.

Alpine skiing events were held at Sestriere.
Cross-country skiing and
biathlon events were held shared by the Cesana San Sicario complex. All the skiing athletes were accommodated in the Mountain Paralympic Village in Sestriere.

Ice sledge hockey was held in Torino Esposizioni and wheelchair curling was held in Pinerolo Palaghiaccio. These athletes were accommodated in the Main Paralympic Village in Turin.

==Torch relay==
The same torch design used for the Olympics was used for the Paralympic Games. On March 5, 2006, the torch began a 10-day journey from Rome to Torino. The Paralympic flame has been lit under the Arch of Constantine on the front of the 
Coliseum in Rome, Italy. The flame was ignited at the coming together of three symbolic figures: a winner at the Rome 1960 Summer Paralympic Games, a current athlete with a disability and a young person with a disability. From the lighting in Rome, the flame was transmitted by satellite to Turin, where the then Mayor of Turin, Sergio Chiamparino, received it at the Piazza della Repubblica]]. From there, the flame was carried along the Via Milano to the Town Hall by the first four torchbearers and the fire burned at the Town Hall - except for two days on Monte Rosa - until 8 March, when started its journey through the city.

Three days before the opening ceremonies, on 5 and 6 March, the Paralympic flame take a leg through the landscape of the Province of Vercelli and went up to the Margherita Hut at the peak of Monte Rosa, when started his way back to Turin. The route, organised together with local groups and authorities, included a parade through the streets of Alagna Valsesia by a group of athletes with a disability. Then a leg with another group of athletes carried the fire to the Alagna-Pianalunga gondola and the continued the way to towards Passo dei Salati.At the next day the torchbearers will followed a trail for about an hour and was taken by helicopter to italian side of the Signalkuppe,reaching in a single group of athletes,the Margherita Hut. A special torch was used to burn the flame on the peak, and this group of athletes donate a symbolic book to the highest library in Europe, situated in the 4.554 meter refuge. At the end of the celebrations, the guides will down the mountain with the flame. On March 8, the torch arrived again in the Torino City Hall and started their way before arriving in the Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino during the Opening Ceremonies.

==Participating National Paralympic Committees (NPC)s ==
Thirty-nine National Paralympic Committees (NPCs) classified athletes to compete at the 2006 Winter Paralympics. This was an increase of three from the 36 represented at the 2002 Winter Paralympics. The number in parentheses indicates the number of participants from each NPC.

Note that, although Greece was scheduled to compete and paraded during the Opening Ceremonies, no Greek athlete took part in any event; the International Paralympic Committee does not list Greece as having entered any athlete in the Games, and considers that there were thirty-eight NPCs at the Games, rather than thirty-nine.

A total of 486 athletes participated in the Games, 385 male and 101 female. This is an increase from the 430 athletes participated in 2002. Despite overall increase of delegates and athletes, the following nations who participated in the 2002 Winter Paralympics did not send athletes to Turin.
*

Mexico was the only country who had sent an athlete to the Winter Paralympics but not the Olympics.

==Other information==
These are the second Paralympic Games to be held in Italy, which hosted the first Summer Paralympics in Rome in 1960.

These are the first Paralympic Games to feature a live webcast of events, hosted by ParalympicSport.TV.

The Games mascot is Aster, a star-shaped snowflake similar in design and was the younger brother to the Olympic mascots Neve and Gliz.

Unable to fund the hosting themselves, the Olympic organizing committee TOROC decided to separate the organization of the two events, separating its Paralympic department into another Organizing Committee (ComParTo) to facilitate the management, organization and training of resources. In the end, ComParTo managed to raise an estimated amount of USD$ 40 million.Despite this, the entire organization of both events was carried out in a unified manner.

<text>The Moonstones () are a set of nine carved sandstone memorials to various members of the Lunar Society. Made in 1998, and unveiled in March 1999, they can be viewed in the grounds of the Asda supermarket in Queslett, Great Barr, Birmingham, England. They are visible from the highway, when travelling from Aldridge Road into Queslett Road, toward the Scott Arms, and face outwards from the supermarket.

They depict nine members of the Society and attributes connected with their work, in order from Aldridge Road round to Queslett Road:

*Josiah Wedgwood: portrait and three women from a jasperware design
*Erasmus Darwin: portrait and design for horizontal windmill
*Samuel Galton: colour wheel
*William Murdock: steam road locomotive
*Matthew Boulton: medal with his portrait
*James Watt: portrait and steam engine
*Joseph Priestley: laboratory equipment
*James Keir: crystals
*William Withering: foxglove, with words from his book &quot;An Account of the Foxglove and some of its Medical Uses&quot;

The stones also each have a phase of the Moon carved on them, with the Watt stone being the full moon.

The designs are by Steve Field and were executed by stonemasons Malcolm Sier and Michael Scheuermann. The rear of the Watt stone includes a carved panel crediting the artists and sponsors.

Great Barr Hall, Galton&#x27;s home and a venue for meetings of the Lunar Society, is nearby.

<doc id="342908" wikidata="Q4773904" url="?curid=342908" title="Anthropologist">
<text>An anthropologist is a scientist engaged in the practice of anthropology. Anthropologists study aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology, cultural anthropology and philosophical anthropology study the norms, values, and general behavior of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life, while economic anthropology studies human economic behavior. Biological (physical), forensic and medical anthropology study the biological development of humans, the application of biological anthropology in a legal setting and the study of diseases and their impacts on humans over time, respectively.

== Education ==
Anthropologists usually cover a breadth of topics within anthropology in their undergraduate education and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the graduate level. In some universities, a qualifying exam serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student&#x27;s understanding of anthropology; the students who pass are permitted to work on a doctoral dissertation.

Anthropologists typically hold graduate degrees, either doctorates or master&#x27;s degrees. Not holding an advanced degree is rare in the field. Some anthropologists hold undergraduate degrees in other fields than anthropology and graduate degrees in anthropology.

== Career ==

Research topics of anthropologists include the discovery of human remains and artifacts as well as the exploration of social and cultural issues such as population growth, structural inequality and globalization by making use of a variety of technologies including statistical software and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Anthropological field work requires a faithful representation of observations and a strict adherence to social and ethical responsibilities, such as the acquisition of consent, transparency in research and methodologies and the right to anonymity.

Historically, anthropologists primarily worked in academic settings; however, by 2014, U.S. anthropologists and archaeologists were largely employed in research positions (28%), management and consulting (23%) and government positions (27%). U.S. employment of anthropologists and archaeologists is projected to increase from 7,600 to 7,900 between 2016 and 2026, a growth rate just under half the national median.

Anthropologists without doctorates tend to work more in other fields than academia, while the majority of those with doctorates are primarily employed in academia. Many of those without doctorates in academia tend to work exclusively as researchers and do not teach. Those in research-only positions are often not considered faculty. The median salary for anthropologists in 2015 was $62,220. Many anthropologists report an above average level of job satisfaction.

Although closely related and often grouped with archaeology, anthropologists and archaeologists perform differing roles, though archeology is considered a sub-discipline of anthropology. While both professions focus on the study of human culture from past to present, archaeologists focus specifically on analyzing material remains such as artifacts and architectural remains. Anthropology encompasses a wider range of professions including the rising fields of forensic anthropology, digital anthropology and cyber anthropology. The role of an anthropologist differs as well from that of a historian. While anthropologists focus their studies on humans and human behavior, historians look at events from a broader perspective. Historians also tend to focus less on culture than anthropologists in their studies. A far greater percentage of historians are employed in academic settings than anthropologists, who have more diverse places of employment.

Anthropologists are experiencing a shift in the twenty-first century United States with the rise of forensic anthropology. In the United States, as opposed to many other countries forensic anthropology falls under the domain of the anthropologist and not the Forensic pathologist. In this role, forensic anthropologists help in the identification of skeletal remains by deducing biological characteristics such as sex, age, stature and ancestry from the skeleton. However, forensic anthropologists tend to gravitate more toward working in academic and laboratory settings, while forensic pathologists perform more applied field work. Forensic anthropologists typically hold academic doctorates, while forensic pathologists are medical doctors. The field of forensic anthropology is rapidly evolving with increasingly capable technology and more extensive databases. Forensic anthropology is one of the most specialized and competitive job areas within the field of anthropology and currently has more qualified graduates than positions.

The profession of Anthropology has also received an additional sub-field with the rise of Digital anthropology. This new branch of the profession has an increased usage of computers as well as interdisciplinary work with medicine, computer visualization, industrial design, biology and journalism. Anthropologists in this field primarily study the evolution of human reciprocal relations with the computer-generated world. Cyber anthropologists also study digital and cyber ethics along with the global implications of increasing connectivity. With cyber ethical issues such as net neutrality increasingly coming to light, this sub-field is rapidly gaining more recognition. One rapidly emerging branch of interest for cyber anthropologists is artificial intelligence. Cyber anthropologists study the co-evolutionary relationship between humans and artificial intelligence. This includes the examination of computer-generated (CG) environments and how people interact with them through media such as movies, television, and video.

== Cultural anthropologist ==
Culture anthropology is a sub-field of anthropology specializing in the study of different cultures. They study both small-scale, traditional communities, such as isolated villages, and large-scale, modern societies, such as large cities. They look at different behaviors and patterns within a culture. In order to study these cultures, many anthropologists will live among the culture they are studying.

Cultural anthropologists can work as professors, work for corporations, nonprofit organizations, as well government agencies. The field is very large and people can do a lot as a cultural anthropologist.  

== Notable anthropologists and publications ==
Some notable anthropologists include: Molefi Kete Asante, Ruth Benedict, Franz Boas, Ella Deloria, St. Clair Drake, John Hope Franklin, James George Frazer, Clifford Geertz, Edward C. Green, Zora Neale Hurston, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Bronisław Malinowski, Margaret Mead, Elsie Clews Parsons, Pearl Primus, Paul Rabinow, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Marshall Sahlins, Nancy Scheper-Hughes (b. 1944), Hortense Spillers, Edward Burnett Tylor (1832–1917) and Frances Cress Welsing.

<text>William Murdock ( 1710 October 17, 1769) was an American statesman in colonial Maryland. During the tensions leading up to the American Revolution, he was an important spokesman for the rights of the colonists. He was a delegate representing Maryland in the Stamp Act Congress of 1765.

== Background ==
Murdock was born around 1710 as the son of Capt. John Murdock, a merchant and his wife Katherine Barton. Murdock was likely a first, or second generation Marylander, his father was enormously wealthy. Around 1729, Murdock married Anne Addison. When his father died in 1733, Murdock acquired all of his landholdings. 

In 1737 he first served in public office as sheriff of Prince George&#x27;s County. At the time of his first election he was recorded to have owned 3,291 acres of land in Prince George&#x27;s County. Murdock served as sheriff until 1740. 

In 1748 Murdock enlisted in Capt. George Beall&#x27;s Troop of Horse, representing Prince George&#x27;s County. He would go on to serve in Maryland&#x27;s lower house, representing Prince George&#x27;s County from 1749 to1751. From 1749 to 1769 he served as burgess for Prince George&#x27;s County.

In 1755, Murdock&#x27;s first wife Anne died. On January 1, 1757, Murdock married Anne&#x27;s first cousin, Margaret Dulany, the widow of Alexander Hamilton and daughter of Daniel Dulany the Elder, one of Maryland&#x27;s most prominent families. 

=== Stamp Act Congress ===
In 1765 when protests over the Stamp Act resulted in calling a Congress of the several colonies in New York City, the Maryland Assembly sent Murdock as one of its delegates. Delegates from the Stamp Act Congress later produced the Declaration of Rights and Grievances.

Murdock died on October 17, 1769, at his home, &quot;Padsworth Farm&quot;, in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. At the time of his death, he was known to have at least 11 slaves and 2 indentured servants. His property holdings included at least 5,263 acres in Prince George&#x27;s and Frederick counties, as well as lots in Annapolis.

<doc id="342912" wikidata="Q605790" url="?curid=342912" title="Meditations on First Philosophy">
<text>Meditations on First Philosophy, in which the existence of God and the immortality of the soul are demonstrated (), often called simply the &quot;Meditations&quot;, is a philosophical treatise by René Descartes first published in Latin in 1641. The French translation (by the Duke of Luynes with Descartes&#x27; supervision) was published in 1647 as &quot;Méditations Métaphysiques&quot;. The title may contain a misreading by the printer, mistaking &quot;animae immortalitas&quot; for &quot;animae immaterialitas&quot;, as suspected by A. Baillet.

The book is made up of six meditations, in which Descartes first discards all belief in things that are not absolutely certain, and then tries to establish what can be known for sure. He wrote the meditations as if he had meditated for six days: each meditation refers to the last one as &quot;yesterday&quot;. (In fact, Descartes began work on the &quot;Meditations&quot; in 1639.) One of the most influential philosophical texts ever written, it is widely read to this day.

The book consists of the presentation of Descartes&#x27; metaphysical system at its most detailed level and in the expanding of his philosophical system, first introduced in the fourth part of his &quot;Discourse on Method&quot; (1637). Descartes&#x27; metaphysical thought is also found in the &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot; (1644), which the author intended to be a philosophical guidebook.

==Letter of Dedication and Preface==

=== Letter of dedication ===
&quot;To the most wise and illustrious the Dean and Doctors of the Sacred Faculty of Theology in Paris&quot;

Descartes writes the above dedication to ask for the protection of the Faculty for his work.

His first consideration is that the existence of God has to be demonstrated philosophically, besides the theological reasons for belief, particularly if we consider to make a demonstration for the non-believers. Moreover, the believers could be accused of making a circular reasoning, when saying that we must believe in God because of the Scriptures, and in the authority of the Scriptures because they have been inspired by God. He further indicates how the very Scriptures say that the mind of man is sufficient to discover God.

His aim is to apply a method to demonstrate these two truths, in a so clear and evident manner that result to be evident. This method he has developed for the Sciences.

=== Preface to the reader ===
Descartes explains how he made a mention of the two questions, the existence of God, and the soul, in his &quot;Discourse on Method&quot;. Following this, he received objections, and two of them he considers are of importance. The first is how he concludes that the essence of the soul is a thing that thinks, excluding all other nature. To this he says that he has a clear perception that he is a thinking thing, and has no other clear perception, and from this he concludes that there is nothing else in the essence of the self.

The second is that from the idea I have of something that is more perfect than myself, it cannot be concluded that it exists. In the treatise we will see that in fact from the idea that there is something more perfect than myself, it follows that this exists.

It goes on to comment that on a general level the reasoning used by the atheists for denying the existence of God is based in the fact that &quot;we ascribe to God affections that are human, or we attribute so much strength and wisdom to our minds&quot; that we presume to understand that which God can and ought to do. He says that we have to consider God as incomprehensible and infinite, and our minds as limited and finite.

Finally says that the treatise was submitted to some men of learning to know their difficulties and objections, and are answered at the end of it.

== Structure ==
Descartes does not outline the text with a systematic structure. He writes the meditations in a first-person point-of-view, intending for the readers to meditate with him. Thus, the text serves as a handbook of meditative practices—it does not only convey a message, but an experience, too.

==Summary and analysis==
The &quot;Meditations&quot; is written in the first person, so many authors refer to the arguments as simply spoken by René Descartes, but others consider that he is speaking in the person of an alter ego who they call &quot;the meditator&quot;, as is done here sometimes. (, so no consistency has been enforced on this.)

===I. What Can Be Called into Doubt===
The First Meditation, subtitled &quot;What can be called into doubt&quot;, opens with the Meditator reflecting on the number of falsehoods he has believed during his life and on the subsequent faultiness of the body of knowledge he has built up from these falsehoods. He has resolved to sweep away all he thinks he knows and to start again from the foundations, building up his knowledge once more on more certain grounds. He has seated himself alone, by the fire, free of all worries so that he can demolish his former opinions with care.

The Meditator reasons that he need only find some reason to doubt his present opinions in order to prompt him to seek sturdier foundations for knowledge. Rather than doubt every one of his opinions individually, he reasons that he might cast them all into doubt if he can doubt the foundations and basic principles on which the opinions are founded.

Everything that the Meditator has accepted as most true he has come to learn from or through his senses. He acknowledges that sometimes the senses can deceive, but only with respect to objects that are very small or far away, and that our sensory knowledge on the whole is quite sturdy. The Meditator acknowledges that insane people might be more deceived, but that he is clearly not one of them and needn&#x27;t worry himself about that.

However, the Meditator realizes that he is often convinced when he is dreaming that he is sensing real objects. He feels certain that he is awake and sitting by the fire, but reflects that often he has dreamed this very sort of thing and been wholly convinced by it. Though his present sensations may be dream images, he suggests that even dream images are drawn from waking experience, much like paintings in that respect. Even when a painter creates an imaginary creature, like a mermaid, the composite parts are drawn from real things—women and fish, in the case of a mermaid. And even when a painter creates something entirely new, at least the colors in the painting are drawn from real experience. Thus, the Meditator concludes, though he can doubt composite things, he cannot doubt the simple and universal parts from which they are constructed like shape, quantity, size, time, etc. While we can doubt studies based on composite things, like medicine, astronomy, or physics, he concludes that we cannot doubt studies based on simple things, like arithmetic and geometry.

On further reflection, the Meditator realizes that even simple things can be doubted. Omnipotent God could make even our conception of mathematics false. One might argue that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses would not have been created by a perfect being.

The Meditator finds it almost impossible to keep his habitual opinions and assumptions out of his head, try as he might. He resolves to pretend that these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counterbalance his habitual way of thinking. The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, an important distinction. He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false. By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon.

Before retiring for the night, the Meditator indulges in his old beliefs, afraid to awake to a life of confusion. As a result he allows for the tempting falsehoods to continue unabridged.

====Analysis====

Descartes saw his &quot;Meditations&quot; as providing the metaphysical underpinning of his new physics. Like Galileo, he sought to overturn what he saw as two-thousand-year-old prejudices injected into the Western tradition by Aristotle. The Aristotelian thought of Descartes&#x27; day placed great weight on the testimony of the senses, suggesting that all knowledge comes from the senses. The Meditator&#x27;s suggestion that all of one&#x27;s most certain knowledge comes from the senses is meant to appeal directly to the Aristotelian philosophers who will be reading the &quot;Meditations&quot;. The motivation, then, behind the First Meditation is to start in a position the Aristotelian philosophers would agree with and then, subtly, to seduce them away from it. Descartes is aware of how revolutionary his ideas are, and must pay lip service to the orthodox opinions of the day in order to be heeded.

Reading the First Meditation as an effort to coax Aristotelians away from their customary opinions allows us to read different interpretations into the different stages of doubt. For instance, there is some debate as to whether Descartes intended his famous &quot;Dream Argument&quot; to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming—that though there is waking experience, I can never know which moments are dreams and which are waking—or the possibility of a universal dream—that my whole life is a dream and that there is no waking world. If we read Descartes as suggesting the universal possibility of dreaming, we can explain an important distinction between the Dream Argument and the later &quot;Evil Demon&quot; argument. The latter suggests that all we know is false and that we cannot trust the senses one bit. The Dream Argument, if meant to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming, suggests only that the senses are not always and wholly reliable. The Dream Argument questions Aristotelian epistemology, while the Evil Demon Argument does away with it altogether. The &quot;Painter&#x27;s Analogy&quot;, which draws on the Dream Argument, concludes that mathematics and other purely cerebral studies are far more certain than astronomy or physics, which is an important step away from the Aristotelian reliance on the senses and toward Cartesian rationalism.

Read on its own, the First Meditation can be seen as presenting skeptical doubts as a subject of study in their own right. Descartes raised the mystifying question of how we can claim to know with certainty anything about the world around us. The idea is not that these doubts are probable, but that their possibility can never be entirely ruled out. And if we can never be certain, how can we claim to know anything? Skepticism cuts straight to the heart of the Western philosophical enterprise and its attempt to provide a certain foundation for our knowledge and understanding of the world. It can even be pushed so far as to be read as a challenge to our very notion of rationality.

It is difficult to justify a dismissal of skepticism. Western philosophy since Descartes has been largely marked and motivated by an effort to overcome this problem. 
Descartes&#x27; doubt is a methodological and rational doubt. That is, the Meditator is not just doubting everything at random, but is providing solid reasons for his doubt at each stage. For instance, he rejects the possibility that he might be mad since that would undercut the rationality that motivates his doubt. Descartes is trying to set up this doubt within a rational framework and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed.
He goes on to suggest more powerful reasons to doubt that his beliefs are true. In general, his method is that of forming skeptical hypotheses—methodic doubt. In the first meditation, he considers whether he is mad, dreaming, or deceived by an evil demon.

The general form of these arguments is:
# If I am dreaming/deceived, then my beliefs are unreliable

Descartes&#x27; goal, as stated at the beginning of the meditation, is to suspend judgment about any belief that is even slightly doubtful. The skeptical scenarios show that all of the beliefs he considers in the first meditation—including, at the very least, all his beliefs about the physical world, are doubtful. So he decides to suspend judgment. He will henceforth give up all of his beliefs about the physical world. He also decides to continually remind himself to avoid habitually falling into accepting beliefs without support, a habit to which he is susceptible.

===II. The Nature of the Human Mind===
In &quot;Meditation II: Concerning the Nature of the Human Mind: That the mind is more known than the body&quot;, Descartes lays out a pattern of thought, sometimes called representationalism, in response to the doubts forwarded in &quot;Meditation I&quot;. He identifies five steps in this theory:
# We have access to only the world of our ideas; things in the world are accessed only indirectly.
# These ideas are understood to include all of the contents of the mind, including perceptions, images, memories, concepts, beliefs, intentions, decisions, etc.
# Ideas and the things they represent are separate from each other.
# These represented things are many times &quot;external&quot; to the mind.
# It is possible for these ideas to constitute either accurate or false representations.

Descartes argues that this representational theory disconnects the world from the mind, leading to the need for some sort of bridge to span the separation and provide &quot;good reasons&quot; to believe that the ideas accurately represent the outside world. The first plank he uses in constructing this bridge can be found in the following excerpt:
I have convinced myself that there is nothing in the world — no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Doesn&#x27;t it follow that I don&#x27;t exist? No, surely I must exist if it&#x27;s me who is convinced of something. But there is a deceiver, supremely powerful and cunning whose aim is to see that I am always deceived. But surely I exist, if I am deceived. Let him deceive me all he can, he will never make it the case that I am nothing while I think that I am something. Thus having fully weighed every consideration, I must finally conclude that the statement &quot;I am, I exist&quot; must be true whenever I state it or mentally consider it.
In other words, one&#x27;s consciousness implies one&#x27;s existence. In one of Descartes&#x27; replies to objections to the book, he summed this up in the phrase &quot;cogito, ergo sum&quot;, &#x27;Ithink therefore I am.&#x27;

Once he secures his existence, however, Descartes seeks to find out what &quot;I&quot; is. He rejects the typical method, which looks for a definition (e.g., Rational Animal), because the words used in the definition would then need to be defined. He seeks &quot;simple terms&quot; that do not need to be defined in this way, but whose meaning can just be &quot;seen.&quot; From these self-evident truths, &quot;complex terms&quot; can be built up.

The first of these self-evident truths is Descartes&#x27; proof of existence turned on its head:
But what then am I? A thinking thing. And what is that? Something that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, and also senses and has mental images.
To define himself further, Descartes turns to the example of wax. He determines that wax is not wax because of its color, texture or shape, as all of these things can change and the substance still be wax. He believes that wax is perceived &quot;by the intellect alone.&quot; Therefore, he distinguishes between &quot;ordinary perception&quot; and &quot;judgment&quot;. When one understands the mathematical principles of the substance, such as its expansion under heat, figure and motion, the knowledge of the wax can be &quot;clear and distinct&quot;.

If a substance such as wax can be known in this fashion, then the same must be of ourselves. The self, then, is not determined by what we sense of ourselves—these hands, this head, these eyes—but by simply the things one thinks. Thus, one &quot;can&#x27;t grasp anything more easily or plainly than [his] mind.&quot;

Descartes concludes that he exists because he is a &quot;thinking thing.&quot; If he is the thing that can be deceived and can think and have thoughts, then he must exist.

===III. Concerning God, That He Exists===
Descartes proposed that there are three types of ideas:

# Innate: ideas that are, and have always been, within us;
# Fictitious (or Invented): ideas that come from our imagination; and
# Adventitious: ideas that come from experiences of the world.

Descartes argues that the idea of God is &quot;innate&quot; and placed in us by God, and rejects the possibility of such being &quot;invented&quot; or &quot;adventitious&quot;.

Argument 1

# Something cannot come from nothing.
# The cause of an idea must have at least as much formal reality as the idea has objective reality.
# I have in me an idea of God. This idea has infinite objective reality.
# I cannot be the cause of this idea, since I am not an infinite and perfect being. I don&#x27;t have enough formal reality. Only an infinite and perfect being could cause such an idea.
# So God—a being with infinite formal reality—must exist (and be the source of my idea of God).
# An absolutely perfect being is a good, benevolent being.
# So God is benevolent...
# So God would not deceive me, and would not permit me to err without giving me a way to correct my errors.

Argument 2
# I exist.
# My existence must have a cause.
# The only possible ultimate causes are:
#Not &quot;a.&quot;: If I had created myself, I would have made myself perfect.
#Not b.: This does not solve the problem. If I am a dependent being, I need to be continually sustained by another.
#Not &quot;c.&quot;: This leads to an infinite regress.
#Not &quot;d.&quot;: The idea of perfection that exists in me cannot have originated from a non-perfect being.
#Therefore, &quot;e.&quot; God exists.
Descartes argued that he had a clear and distinct idea of God. In the same way that the &quot;cogito&quot; was self-evident, so too is the existence of God, as his perfect idea of a perfect being could not have been caused by anything less than a perfect being.

===IV. Concerning the True and the False===

The conclusions of the previous Meditations that &quot;I&quot; and &quot;God&quot; both exist lead to another problem: If God is perfectly good and the source of all that is, how is there room for error or falsehood? Descartes attempts to answer this question in &quot;Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity&quot;:
If I&#x27;ve got everything in me from God and He hasn&#x27;t given me the ability to make errors, it doesn&#x27;t seem possible for me ever to be in error.
The framework of his arguments centers on the &quot;great chain of being&quot;, in which God&#x27;s perfect goodness is relative to His perfect being. On the extreme opposite end of the scale is complete nothingness, which is also the most evil state possible. Thus, humans are an intermediary between these two extremes, being less &quot;real&quot; or &quot;good&quot; than God, but more &quot;real&quot; and &quot;good&quot; than nothingness. Thus, error (as a part of evil) is not a positive reality, it is only the absence of what is correct. In this way, its existence is allowed within the context of a perfectly inerrant God.
I find that I am &quot;intermediate&quot; between God and nothingness, between the supreme entity and nonentity. Insofar as I am the creation of the supreme entity, there&#x27;s nothing in me to account for my being deceived or led into error, but, inasmuch as I somehow participate in nothing or nonentity — that is, insofar as I am distinct from the supreme entity itself and lack many things — it&#x27;s not surprising that I go wrong. I thus understand that, in itself, error is a lack, rather than a real thing dependent on God. Hence, I understand that I can err without God&#x27;s having given me a special ability to do so. Rather, I fall into error because my God-given ability to judge the truth is not infinite.
Descartes also concedes two points that might allow for the possibility of his ability to make errors. First, he notes that it is very possible that his limited knowledge prevents him from understanding &quot;why&quot; God chose to create him so he could make mistakes. If he could see the things that God could see, with a complete and infinite scope, perhaps he would judge his ability to err as the best option. He uses this point to attack the Aristotelian structure of causes. The final cause described by Aristotle are the &quot;what for&quot; of an object, but Descartes claims that because he is unable to comprehend completely the mind of God, it is impossible to understand completely the &quot;why&quot; through science—only the &quot;how.&quot;
I realize that I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised at God&#x27;s doing things that I can&#x27;t explain. I shouldn&#x27;t doubt His existence just because I find that I sometimes can&#x27;t understand why or how He has made something. I know that my nature is weak and limited and that God&#x27;s is limitless, incomprehensible, and infinite, and, from this, I can infer that He can do innumerable things whose reasons are unknown to me. On this ground alone, I regard the common practice of explaining things in terms of their purposes to be useless in physics: it would be foolhardy of me to think that I can discover God&#x27;s purposes.
Secondly, he considers the possibility that an apparent error at the individual level could be understood within the totality of creation as error free.
When asking whether God&#x27;s works are perfect, I ought to look at all of them together, not at one isolation. For something that seems imperfect when viewed alone might seem completely perfect when regarded as having a place in the world. Of course, since calling everything into doubt, I haven&#x27;t established that anything exists besides me and God. But, when I consider God&#x27;s immense power, I can&#x27;t deny that He has made — or, in any case, that He could have made — many other things, and I must therefore view myself as having a place in a universe.
Lastly, &quot;Meditation IV&quot; attributes the source of error to a discrepancy between two divine gifts: understanding and free will. Understanding is given in an incomplete form, while will (by nature) can only be either completely given or not given at all. When he is presented with a certain amount of understanding and then &quot;chooses&quot; to act outside of that, he is in error. Thus, the gifts of God (understanding and will) both remain good and only the incorrect usage by him remains as error.
If I suspend judgement when I don&#x27;t clearly and distinctly grasp what is true, I obviously do right and am not deceived. But, if I either affirm or deny in a case of this sort, I misuse my freedom of choice. If I affirm what is false, I clearly err, and, if I stumble onto the truth, I&#x27;m still blameworthy since the light of nature reveals that a perception of the understanding should always precede a decision of the will. In these misuses of freedom of choice lies the deprivation that accounts for error. And this deprivation, I maintain, lies in the working of the will insofar as it comes from me — not in my God-given ability to will, or even in the will&#x27;s operation insofar as it derives from Him.
===V. The Essence of Material Things, and Again Concerning God, That He Exists===
&quot;Meditation V: Concerning the Essence of Material Things, and Again Concerning God, That He Exists&quot; begins with the stated purpose of expanding the &quot;known items&quot; of God and self to include outside material objects; but Descartes saves that for &quot;Meditation VI&quot; in lieu of something he deems more fundamental but in the same direction: a discussion concerning the &quot;ideas&quot; of those external items. Along the way, he advances another logical proof of God&#x27;s existence.
Before asking whether any such objects exist outside me, I ought to consider the ideas of these objects as they exist in my thoughts and see which are clear and which confused.
Descartes separates external objects into those that are clear and distinct and those that are confused and obscure. The former group consists of the ideas of extension, duration and movement. These geometrical ideas cannot be misconstrued or combined in a way that makes them false. For example, if the idea of a creature with the head of a giraffe, the body of a lion and tail of a beaver was constructed and the question asked if the creature had a large intestine, the answer would have to be invented. But, no mathematical re-arrangement of a triangle could allow its three internal angles to sum to anything but 180 degrees. Thus, Descartes perceived that truths may have a nature or essence of themselves, independent of the thinker. In Descartes&#x27; formulation, this is a &quot;mathematical&quot; truth only pragmatically related to nature; the properties of triangles in Euclidean geometry remain mathematically certain.
I find in myself innumerable ideas of things which, though they may not exist outside me, can&#x27;t be said to be nothing. While I have some control over my thoughts of these things, I do not make the things up: they have their own real and immutable natures. Suppose, for example, that I have a mental image of a triangle. While it may be that no figure of this sort does exist or ever has existed outside my thought, the figure has a fixed nature (essence or form), immutable and eternal, which hasn&#x27;t been produced by me and isn&#x27;t dependent of my mind.
While thinking about the independence of these ideas of external objects, Descartes realizes that he is just as certain about God as he is about these mathematical ideas. He asserts that this is natural as the ideas of God are the only ideas that imply God&#x27;s existence. He uses the example of a mountain and a valley. While one cannot picture a mountain without a valley, it&#x27;s possible that these do not exist. However, the fact that one cannot conceive of God without existence inherently rules out the possibility of God&#x27;s non-existence. Simply put, the argument is framed as follows:
#God is defined as an infinitely perfect being.
#Perfection includes existence.
#So God exists.

This ontological argument originated in the work of St. Anselm, the medieval Scholastic philosopher and theologian. While Descartes had already claimed to have confirmed God&#x27;s existence through previous arguments, this one allows him to put to rest any discontent he might have had with his &quot;distinct and clear&quot; criteria for truth. With a confirmed existence of God, all doubt that what one previously thought was real and not a dream can be removed. Having made this realization, Descartes asserts that without this sure knowledge in the existence of a supreme and perfect being, assurance of any truth is impossible:Thus I plainly see that the certainty and truth of all my knowledge derives from one thing: my thought of the true God. Before I knew Him, I couldn&#x27;t know anything else perfectly. But now I can plainly and certainly know innumerable things, not only about God and other mental beings, but also about the nature of physical objects, insofar as it is the subject-matter of pure mathematics.

===VI. The Existence of Material Things, and the Real Distinction between Mind and Body===

In &quot;Meditation VI: Concerning the Existence of Material Things, and the Real Distinction between Mind and Body&quot;, Descartes addresses the potential existence of material outside of the self and God. First, he asserts that such objects &quot;can&quot; exist simply because God is able to make them. Therefore, our assumption of the physical world outside of ourselves in non theoretical sense.
Insofar as they are the subject of pure mathematics, I now know at least that they can exist, because I grasp them clearly and distinctly. For God can undoubtedly make whatever I can grasp in this way, and I never judge that something is impossible for Him to make unless there would be a contradiction in my grasping the thing distinctly.
Knowing that the existence of such objects is possible, Descartes then turns to the prevalence of mental images as proof. To do this, he draws a distinction between imagination and understanding—imagination being a non-linguistic &quot;faculty of knowledge to the body which is immediately present to it…without intellection or conception,&quot; which therefore exists like a mental photograph; and understanding (or apprehending) being something that is not necessarily pictured. He uses an example of this to clarify:
When I have a mental image of a triangle, for example, I don&#x27;t just understand that it is a figure bounded by three lines; I also &quot;look at&quot; the lines as though they were present to my mind&#x27;s eye. And this is what I call having a mental image. When I want to think of a chiliagon, I understand that it is a figure with a thousand sides as well as I understand that a triangle is a figure with three, but I can&#x27;t imagine its sides or &quot;look&quot; at them as though they were present.… Thus I observe that a special effort of mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to conceiving or understanding (); and this special exertion of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure intellection (&quot;&quot;).
Descartes has still not given proof that such external objects exist. At this point, he has only shown that their existence could conveniently explain this mental process. To obtain this proof, he first reviews his premises for the &quot;Meditations&quot;—that the senses cannot be trusted and what he is taught &quot;by nature&quot; does not have much credence. However, he views these arguments within a new context; after writing &quot;Meditation I&quot;, he has proved the existence of himself and of a perfect God. Thus, Descartes jumps quickly to proofs of the division between the body and mind and that material things exist:

Proof of the body being distinct from the mind (&quot;mind–body dualism&quot;)
# It is possible for God to create anything I can clearly and distinctly perceive.
# If God creates something to be independent of another, they are distinct from each other.
# I clearly and distinctly understand my existence as a thinking thing (which does not require the existence of a body).
# So God can create a thinking thing independently of a body.
# I clearly and distinctly understand my body as an extended thing (which does not require a mind).
# So God can create a body independently of a mind.
# So my mind is a reality distinct from my body.
# So I (a thinking thing) can exist without a body.

Proof of the reality of external material things
# I have a &quot;strong inclination&quot; to believe in the reality of external material things due to my senses.
# God must have created me with this nature.
# If independent material things do not exist, God is a deceiver.
# But God is not a deceiver.
# So material things exist and contain the properties essential to them.

After using these two arguments to dispel solipsism and skepticism, Descartes seems to have succeeded in defining reality as being in three parts: God (infinite), minds, and material things (both finite). He closes by addressing natural phenomena that might appear to challenge his philosophy, such as phantom limbs, dreams, and dropsy.

==Objections and replies==

Before publishing the &quot;Meditations&quot;, Descartes submitted his manuscript to many philosophers, theologians and a logician, encouraging them to criticize the work. He explained this purpose in a letter to a friend: &quot;I will be very glad if people put to me many objections, the strongest they can find, for I hope that the truth will stand out all the better.&quot; The objections which he gathered, and his own replies (many of which are quite extensive), were included in the first publication of the &quot;Meditations&quot;.

The seven objectors were, in order (of the sets as they were published):
# The Dutch theologian Johannes Caterus (Johan de Kater).
# Various &quot;theologians and philosophers&quot; gathered by Descartes&#x27; friend and principal correspondent, Friar Marin Mersenne.
# The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes.
# The theologian and logician Antoine Arnauld.
# The philosopher Pierre Gassendi — Descartes wrote that this set of objections could be easily dismissed.
# Another miscellany gathered by Mersenne.
# The Jesuit Pierre Bourdin.

Some of the most powerful objections include the following:

Objections to proof(s) of God’s existence:

Objections to the epistemology:

Objections to philosophy of mind:

Elisabeth of Bohemia also corresponded with Descartes on the &quot;Meditations&quot;. She objected both to his description of the union between mind and body, and that virtue and moral truths seem to need to be grasped by something other than the intellect (despite Descartes&#x27; assertion that all truths must be grasped intellectually).

Descartes&#x27; philosophy of solipsism involves the assumption that a given individual will know their own mind best. However, the establishment of behaviorism revealed introspection to be a problematic method. Developments in psychology, based on studies focusing on the relationship between the mind and brain make it difficult to accept Descartes&#x27; contention that the mind can exist without the body. Further, empirical and philosophical work has shown that the mind, or consciousness, develops as a result of social, linguistic, and cultural influence.

==Influence and legacy==
The historical impact of the six meditations has been divided. The first two meditations, which employed the skeptical methodic doubt and concluded that only the ego and its thoughts are indubitable, have had a huge impact in the history of philosophy. They are often considered as epoch-making for modernity, and an unavoidable first step for any modern philosophical thinking.

Arthur David Smith, author of the &quot;Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Husserl&quot;, claims that since Edmund Husserl usually refers only to &quot;the first two&quot; of the Meditations, therefore Husserl must have thought that they are the only part of Descartes&#x27; work with any philosophical importance at all.

<text>Soho Foundry is a factory created in 1795 by Matthew Boulton and James Watt and their sons Matthew Robinson Boulton and James Watt Jr. at Smethwick, West Midlands, England (), for the manufacture of steam engines. Now owned by Avery Weigh-Tronix, it is used for the manufacture of weighing machines.

The early history of the Soho Foundry is of pivotal importance both to the history of the Industrial Revolution and to the study of the development of management theory. The Soho Foundry stood out from other factories of the day in the sophistication of its planning, its production processes and its management techniques; practising concepts that would not become commonplace until a century later. Comparing its workings to the techniques of mass production and scientific management made famous by Henry Ford and Frederick Winslow Taylor in the United States in the early 20th century, the economist Eric Roll wrote &quot;Neither Taylor, Ford nor any other modern experts devised anything in the way of plan that cannot be discovered at Soho before 1805&quot;.

==History==
The factory was built on the edge of the Birmingham Canal on land bought in 1795. The following year the foundry was open.

===Organisation===
The Soho Foundry was planned with a degree of sophistication unprecedented for a factory of its time. Its products were produced out of standardised interchangeable parts, reducing the need to supervise work as it was executed, simplifying stock control and enabling more efficient repair of faults for customers. Production processes were broken down into small tasks, enabling an extremely high degree of specialisation among workers – one document from 1801, for example, describes how a team of four specific workers was &quot;to be constantly employed in fitting nozzles&quot;. These tasks took place in a series of workshops spatially located along the flow of production, minimising the expense and time-wastage of the movement of materials through the works.

The accounting procedures of the foundry bore a striking similarity to modern processes, with each of the three main operating departments - the Foundry Department which made cast iron parts, the Smithy Department which made wrought iron parts, and the Fitting Department which machined the parts and assembled them together - being operated as separate profit centres.

The Soho Foundry was also innovative in the field of personnel management, setting up executive development programmes, sickness benefit schemes and welfare programmes.

===Later development===
By 1840 James Watt Jr. owned the factory after the death of the founding Boulton and Watt. He died in 1848 and his place was taken by H. W. Blake and the name changed from &quot;Soho Foundry&quot; to &quot;James Watt &amp; Co.&quot;.

In 1857 the screw engines for the steamship SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot; were built at the foundry. In 1860 a new mint was started at the Foundry, the Manufactory having closed in April 1850 by Matthew&#x27;s grandson, Matthew Piers Watt Boulton.

In 1861 tests were performed at the Soho Foundry for the London Pneumatic Despatch Company.

In 1895 W &amp; T Avery Ltd. acquired the Foundry as a going concern.

In 1912, the manager of the company William Edward Hipkins, died at the sinking of Titanic while he was travelling as a first class passenger. He was 55 and his body was not recovered.

==Today==
It is now the home of Avery Weigh-Tronix and Avery Berkel, who make weighing scales. The site includes William Murdoch&#x27;s cottage and overlooks Black Patch Park.

There was a small museum there, open only by appointment, but is now closed.

The grade II listed &quot;Pooley&quot; gates, of cast iron, are marked with &quot;a Liver bird above ropework draped with cloth, flanked by nautical symbols including oars, flags and bugles, ships&#x27; wheels and intersecting dolphins&quot;. A plaque reads: &quot;These gates were cast by Henry Pooley and Son about 1840 for the Sailors&#x27; Home, Liverpool. The Avery and Pooley Foundries were amalgamated in 1931&quot;. There was an active campaign to return these gates to Liverpool, resulting in the approval by Sandwell Council in March 2011 of an application to return them. After restoration the gates were returned to Liverpool on 8 August 2011 and were re-erected under the name &quot;The Sailors Home Gateway&quot; in the pedestrian section of Paradise Street in Liverpool One, close to the original site of the Sailors&#x27; Home.

The building is a Grade II* listed building. The gates and adjacent canal bridge are Grade II listed.

The oldest working steam engine, built here, is the Smethwick Engine built to recover water used in the nearby canal locks at Smethwick Summit, and now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum.

<text>Vygruppen, branded as Vy, formerly the Norwegian State Railways (, NSB), is a government-owned railway company which operates most passenger train services and many bus services in Norway. The company is owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport. Its sub-brands include Vy Buss coach services, CargoNet freight trains and the Swedish train transport company Tågkompaniet. In 2009, NSB carried 52 million train passengers and 104 million bus passengers. On 24 April 2019, passenger train and bus services were rebranded as Vy.

The company was established as the Norwegian State Railways (1883–1996). In 1996 the company was split into the new NSB, the infrastructure company, Jernbaneverket and the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. In 2002, the freight operations were split to the subsidiary CargoNet, and the maintenance department became Mantena. It was controversially renamed Vygruppen in 2019; the then-opposition parties vowed to reverse the name change.

==History==

On 1 December 1996, the largest structural change in Norwegian railway history in the 20th century occurred. The old Norwegian State Railways was split into three separate governmental agencies. The ownership, maintenance and construction of the track was transformed to the newly created government agency Norwegian National Rail Administration while a new Norwegian Railway Inspectorate was created to supervise all railway operations in the country. NSB was renamed NSB BA and created as a limited company, wholly owned by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Also, NSB was made a concern, with NSB Biltrafikk (now Vy Buss) and NSB Eiendom (later ROM Eiendom, in 2017 succeeded by Bane NOR Eiendom) made subsidiaries of NSB.

In 1998, the new Oslo Airport, Gardermoen opened, replacing the old Oslo Airport, Fornebu that had been too small since the 1980s. As part of the political compromise to build the new airport, NSB faced a dual mandate. On one hand, the imperative was to establish environmentally sustainable ground infrastructure, prompting the decision to construct a high-speed railway spanning from Oslo Central Station to the airport, resulting in a 19-minute travel time. Concurrently, political stipulations dictated that the airport&#x27;s development should not burden taxpayers financially; thus, the entire project was slated for financing through loans. The result was that the airport was to be financed, built and operated by the Civil Aviation Administration subsidiary Oslo Lufthavn AS while the rail connection was to be financed, built and operated by the NSB subsidiary NSB Gardermobanen. But problems arose during the construction of the Gardermoen Line because of a leak in the Romerike Tunnel, resulting in major budget overruns and a delay in the opening of the tunnel. Still, Norway&#x27;s first high speed railway line opened on time on 8 October 1998 at the same time as the new airport, though the Romerike Tunnel was not opened until 22 October 1999, more than a year after its scheduled opening. The service is operated using 16 custom built Class 71 electric multiple units, with a capacity for 168 passengers and maximum speed of .

NSB tried to modernize itself in the late 1990s through the acquisition of new rolling stock and a new brand image. The first stock to be delivered were 22 El 18 electric locomotives. These were meant to take over passenger train traffic in Southern Norway while the El 16s and El 14s were moved to the freight division and the El 17s were scrapped, relegated to shunting or sold to the Flåm Line. The new locomotives were capable of speeds up to . For the diesel lines, NSB attempted to buy 12 Di 6 from Siemens, but had to return them after they failed to operate sufficiently in the northern Norwegian cold. NSB also decided to re-brand itself with three district brands: NSB Signatur (express trains), NSB Agenda (regional trains) and NSB Puls (local trains). At the same time, NSB ordered new electric multiple units, first of all for the new Airport Express Train service, Class 71. This was followed up with 16 new Signatur trains of Class 73 that were to be used on the express services on the Bergen Line, the Dovre Line and the Sørlandet Line and equipped with tilting technology. This was an attempt to create a high speed railway service using existing rail track, though the operating times between Oslo and the termini were only reduced by about 10 minutes. These trains were painted blue and grey, and were the first non-red trains to be operated by NSB in decades. At the same time, NSB announced the introduction of the Agenda concept, that was to replace the NSB InterCity Express services and the diesel services. While the Class 70s were simply repainted, the diesel services on the Nordland Line, the Rauma Line and the Røros Line were upgrades with 15 new Class 93 units in 2001, though criticized for lack of comfort, have increased the speed on the railways. NSB also discontinued night train services on the Rauma Line and Røros Line. Starting in 2002, NSB also received 36 new electrical local trains, Class 72. These were painted grey/green (for the use of the brand name &quot;Puls&quot;) and were put in the Oslo Commuter Rail and Jæren Commuter Rail. NSB has now discontinued the use of brand names on its rail products.

By 2002, the Bondevik&#x27;s Second Cabinet wanted to further deregulate the Norwegian railway sector, and made NSB a limited company NSB AS on 1 July. NSB had been through a process of making the company more of a corporation, with the IT section made the subsidiary Arrive and the maintenance transformed to Mantena. NSB also purchased part of the Swedish Tågkompaniet while the old freight train section NSB Gods was transformed to CargoNet. 45% of the subsidiary was then sold to the Statens Järnvägar successor Green Cargo. In 2004, the government also split NSB Gardermobanen in two, deleting the companies debt, transferring the track it owned to Jernbaneverket and the train operations to a new, government-owned enterprise, the Airport Express Train.

On 24 April 2019, NSB was renamed Vygruppen and rebranded as Vy (it is a Scandinavian word meaning vision, outlook, overview or prospect). According to a survey by the Language Council of Norway, the name change was only supported by 7% of Norwegians.

==Services==
Vy operates with three main types of passenger rail transport: intercity trains, regional trains and commuter trains.

===Inter-city services===
Long-haul electric passenger trains services are offered on the Bergen Line. The four day trains are operated with traditional locomotive hauled trains (electric locomotives El18 and coaches Class 7). A night train service with WLAB2 sleeping coaches is also offered on these lines. 

===Regional services===
Vy has two regional rail services. All regional trains are to receive the new livery of red and grey. NSB has previously used the brand name &quot;Agenda&quot; on its regional services.

Regional services use Class 74 (R10 Skien–Lillehammer) and Class 73b (R20 Oslo S – Halden – (Gothenburg)). The service is provided hourly along the Trunk Line, the Vestfold Line and the Østfold Line. The trains running between Lillehammer and Skien serve Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, providing an alternative to the Airport Express Train.

Around the cities of Bergen, Oslo and Skien Vy operates commuter train services using Class 69, Class 72, Class 74 and Class 75 electric multiple units and Class 92 diesel multiple units. The services usually have hourly or semi-hourly frequency. NSB tried using the brand name &quot;Puls&quot; for the commuter trains, and have painted some of the trains green. The Puls brand has been discontinued.

The Oslo Commuter Rail provides the following services, with Class 69, Class 72 and Class 75:
* L1 (Spikkestad)–Asker–Oslo–Lillestrøm (Trunk Line )
* L12 Eidsvoll–Oslo–Drammen–Kongsberg (Trunk Line and Sørland Line)
* L13 Drammen–Skøyen–Oslo–Jessheim–Dal (Trunk Line and Drammen Line)
* L14 Asker–Lillestrøm–Årnes–Kongsvinger (Kongsvinger Line)
* L2 Stabekk–Oslo–Ski (Østfold Line)
* L21 Stabekk–Oslo–Moss (Østfold Line)
* L22 Skøyen–Oslo–Mysen–(Rakkestad) (Østfold Line)

Other commuter train services:
* The Bergen Commuter Rail: Bergen–Voss–Myrdal (Bergen Line) with Class 69
* Porsgrunn–Notodden (Bratsberg Line) with Y1 class railcar

In 2005, services on Gjøvik Line were transferred to NSB Gjøvikbanen (now Vy Gjøvikbanen) after the NSB subsidiary had won a public tender bid for a ten-year public service obligation contract with the Norwegian Ministry of Transportation and Communication. The Norwegian Minister of Transportation and Communications, Liv Signe Navarsete (Centre Party), has announced that the present government (as of 2006) will discontinue the previous government&#x27;s announcements to put more rail line operations on public tender.

==Rolling stock==

The Norwegian passenger train division has a fleet of 36 Class 72 and 82 Class 69 electric multiple units (EMU) and 14 Class 92 diesel multiple units (DMU) for commuter services. The company has a further 22 Class 73 and 16 Class 70 EMUs and Class 93 DMUs for regional and intercity trains, which are also provided by 22 El 18 and 5 Di 4 locomotives which haul Class 5 and Class 7 passenger cars. Vy receives subsidies to operate unprofitable route from its owner, while services on the Gjøvik Line have been made subject to public service obligations, which is operated by Vy&#x27;s subsidiary Vy Gjøvikbanen.

During the 1990s, NSB modernized their rolling stock, expanding their fleet of multiple units and retiring many of the traditional locomotive-hauled trains. Most of the locomotives were sold to the freight company CargoNet AS, but the models El18 and Di4 remain to haul passenger trains. Some of the new trains were plagued with troubles, in particular a brand new Class 73 derailed at low speed at Nelaug in 2000 because of an axle breaking due to metal fatigue. As of 2005, however, these trains have been performing satisfactorily.

In August 2008, NSB announced it had ordered 50 new five-car electric multiple units of the Class 74 and 75. These will be used for local service in the Greater Oslo area (24 sets) and also regional service in southern Norway (26 sets). The delivery is scheduled for 2012 but delayed because of accident during testing, by that time much of the rail network is expected to be upgraded to double track, enabling an increase in frequency. The contract which is worth approximately 840 mill. Swiss francs gives NSB an option to buy an additional 100 sets. These trains have been specifically modified to operate in Norwegian climate and have a maximum speed of .

<text>Birmingham Central Library was the main public library in Birmingham, England, from 1974 until 2013, replacing a library opened in 1865 and rebuilt in 1882. For a time the largest non-national library in Europe, it closed on 29 June 2013 and was replaced by the Library of Birmingham. The building was demolished in 2016, after 41 years, as part of the redevelopment of Paradise Circus by Argent Group. Designed by architect John Madin in the brutalist style, the library was part of an ambitious development project by Birmingham City Council to create a civic centre on its new Inner Ring Road system; however, for economic reasons significant parts of the master plan were not completed, and quality was reduced on materials as an economic measure. Two previous libraries occupied the adjacent site before Madin&#x27;s library opened in 1974. The previous library, designed by John Henry Chamberlain, opened in 1883 and featured a tall clerestoried reading room. It was demolished in 1974 after the new library had opened.

Despite the original vision not being fully implemented, the library gained architectural praise as an icon of British brutalism with its stark use of concrete, bold geometry, inverted ziggurat sculptural form and monumental scale. Its style was seen at the time as a symbol of social progressivism. Based on this, English Heritage applied but failed twice for the building to gain listed status. However, due to strong opposition from Birmingham City Council the building gained immunity from listing until 2016.

In 2010–11, Central Library was the second-most visited library in the country, with 1,197,350 visitors.

==Earlier libraries==

The first Central Library occupied a site to the south of Edmund Street and west of the Town Hall. The site had been acquired from the Birmingham and Midland Institute (BMI) in 1860 after the construction of their own building in 1857 on the corner of Paradise Street and Ratcliff Place. The BMI building was to include a library, but under the Public Libraries Act 1850 a referendum took place on the creation of a municipal library. After the first vote failed, a second one passed in 1860 causing the BMI and the corporation to cooperate on the joint site.

E. M. Barry was the architect for the BMI building and it was hoped he could be retained as the architect for the adjoining library, but his plans were deemed too expensive for the corporation. Martin &amp; Chamberlain&#x27;s plans were approved in October 1862 for a tender price of £8,600 with E. M. Barry&#x27;s classical facade retained in the design. The Lending Library was opened on 6 September 1865 and the Reference Library was opened just over a year later on 26 October 1866. The chief librarian at the time of opening was John Davies Mullins. Initial use of the library was so heavy that the need for an extension was agreed in 1872 but deferred until 1878. On 11 January 1879 a fire broke out behind a wooden partition serving as a temporary wall during building operations. The fire caused extensive damage, with only 1,000 volumes saved from a stock of 50,000.

Plans to rebuild the library after the fire had been approved as early as May 1879. The library was rebuilt on the same site by J. H. Chamberlain in a Lombardic Renaissance style with a tall clerestoried Reading Room. At a cost of £54,975 the second Central Library opened on 1 June 1882.

As the number of books increased, the Council resolved in 1938 that a new library was an &quot;urgent necessity&quot;, but the outbreak of World War II meant that it was not until 1960, and the development of a new Inner Ring Road through the site of the old library, that a general specification was agreed. The library and the BMI building were demolished (the BMI moving to premises a short distance to the east), and the site was part of the Birmingham Conservatoire and its gardens (until the Conservatoire was relocated to Birmingham City University&#x27;s City Centre campus in Eastside in 2017, following the redevelopment of Paradise Circus.) The 1970s Central Library was constructed on a site originally occupied by Mason Science College and Liberal Club.

==Architecture==

The new Central Library opened on 12 January 1974. It was designed by John Madin, a Birmingham-based architect. Its inverted ziggurat form was a powerful example of the Brutalist style. With the Rotunda and the Alpha Tower, it became one of Birmingham&#x27;s key Modernist buildings.

Madin designed the Central Library as part of a large civic centre scheme on the newly created Paradise Circus site. Originally planned to be built alongside the library was a School of Music, Drama Centre, Athletic Institute, offices, shops, public house, a car park with 500 spaces and a bus interchange. The collection of civic buildings were all to be connected by high level walkways and the network of galleries which bridge the roads. The School of Music and a public house (The Yardbird) were the only other buildings in the original plans to be built and the high level walkways were never completed.
The Central Library consisted of two elements: the extrovert lending library and the introvert reference library. The lending library was designed for heavy use and short visits. It formed a wing to the reference library and was of three storeys with a curved façade facing the Town Hall. The reference library was an eight-storey square block designed around an open atrium above a public square that was designed to be entered from four sides. Above the square floated the cantilevered floors of the library in a distinctive inverted ziggurat formation. The designers drew inspiration for the design from Antonio Sant&#x27;Elia&#x27;s drawings of Casa a gradinata, and Marcel Breuer&#x27;s 1928 scheme for a hospital in Elberfeld, Germany; while another source of inspiration was Leslie Martin&#x27;s Bodleian Law Library in Oxford. It has also been suggested that they were influenced by the similar design for Boston City Hall, but a member of Madin&#x27;s design team said they had only seen this design after the library was complete.

The central atrium was completely glazed behind deep concrete balconies; this arrangement was to make it conducive to study. Although there was good natural light, the design was an early recognition of solar gain and the damage it can cause to books. The large windows of the reference library face inwards to reduce traffic noise from the Inner Ring road. On the outside the windows were high level narrow strips with black anodised window frames. The space below the central atrium of the library was designed to define a civic square with gardens, pools, waterfalls and fountains, and potentially to form an open-air exhibition space. Six pools were to be placed in and around this square. Madin also designed the semi-circular amphitheatre around the Chamberlain Memorial in Chamberlain Square to frame the entrance to the library and the new civic square.
The structure was supported on a square set of twelve reinforced concrete columns, built over the Inner Ring road and the uncompleted bus interchange. The bus bays imposed a 36 ft pier spacing on the main block, and led to the standardization of a 1 ft 6in module for the design. Concrete was strongly expressed within the building, the external finishes to structural elements being unclad reinforced concrete. The walls were ribbed, and the locally graded round aggregate was exposed by abrasive blasting. The floors were made of precast concrete coffered units over which a reinforced concrete floor was cast. For the cladding Madin offered the council a choice of Portland stone or Travertine Marble to align with the adjacent civic buildings. A third, cheaper option was pre-cast concrete with Hoptonwood limestone and Derbyshire spar aggregate with white cement: this was offered by Alan Maudsley, the City Architect, and accepted by the council as an economy measure.
The entrance hall, which was double height between the lending and reference libraries, was entirely glazed on the side facing the atrium – an early example of a freestanding wall made of toughened glass. Before later developments the wall allowed the entrance to be flooded with light and provided views of the Town Hall from the escalators.

The library aimed to provide open access to all its 900,000 volumes. No basement was possible because of the low level roads beneath the library and a tall book stack was deemed inappropriate because of the desire to keep the height of the building low, so it did not overwhelm the surrounding buildings. Storage of the volumes was on the same level as the reading areas: this dual function led to the low ceiling height of three metres. Space was created in the reference library by opening up sections of the floors into double height reading spaces. The furniture for the library was specified by the architects, with a preference for oak veneer book stacks and black linoleum floor covering.

When built, the Central Library provided approximately 23.300 m2 (250,000 ft2) of floor space, making it the largest non-national municipal library in Europe. It was specifically designed for a long life and to stand hard wear with low maintenance costs.

===Later developments===

The council failed to implement the original plan for Paradise Circus. Spending cuts led to the council&#x27;s decision to sell off the land surrounding the library, ending the vision of a publicly financed and owned civic centre occupying the entire site.

The 200 seat Library Theatre was built between the School of Music and the reference library block in 1983–86. The theatre was a design and build scheme by Henry Boot Projects. Although the design was in Madin&#x27;s original plans, Madin did not approve of the design and build method and subsequently had no involvement in the building. Chamberlain House and the Copthorne Hotel were built to the west of the library in 1985–87 by Leonard J. Multon &amp; Partners with wedge shaped ends.

To the north of the library, where an Athletic Institute was originally to stand, a six-storey office block was built in 1988–89 by Leonard J. Multon &amp; Partners. A footbridge connecting the library with Centenary Square was added as part of improvements to the square in 1988–89. The atrium was enclosed with a glass roof and screens by the City Architect&#x27;s Department in 1989–91. The space below was named Paradise Forum, originally proposed as an alfresco eating and entertainment area, but eventually leased to property companies who sublet the units to shops and fast food outlet tenants. The uncompleted bus interchange became service areas for the tenants of Paradise Forum. In 1999 the whole of Paradise Forum was sold off to Argent now known as Argent (Property Development) Services LLP.

In 1999, a member of the public was almost hit by a small piece of concrete that fell from a cladding panel. Concerns over the condition of the pre-cast cladding panels required the installation of netting to retain any further erosion. The entrance from Chamberlain Square was altered by the city&#x27;s Urban Design team in 2001, creating a lobby and eliminating the effect of the original tall entrance hall. In July 2010, the east side of the lending library was decorated with painted birds, the work of Lucy McLauchlan.

The appearance of the library building was criticised, mostly on account of the staining of the cladding panels which were originally white and were never cleaned. Prince Charles, in his 1988 television documentary and book &quot;A Vision of Britain&quot;, described the building as resembling &quot;a place where books are incinerated, not kept&quot;. In October 2011 the World Monuments Fund included the Central Library on its watch list of significant buildings at risk.

==Closure and demolition==

Birmingham City Council had long planned to move library services away from the Central Library to leave the building free for redevelopment of Paradise Circus. The Paradise Circus site was sold by the Council in 1998 to Argent Group, this spelt an end to the Central Library.

In 2004 an initial plan to move to a building designed by Richard Rogers in Eastside did not materialise. Instead, a site in Centenary Square, 150m to the west of the existing building, was chosen in 2007; and subsequently the new Library of Birmingham was built and opened on 3 September 2013. In the intervening years Argent Group produced plans for the Paradise Circus site which did not include retention of the library building. In response to potential demolition English Heritage applied on two occasions for the building to be listed. On both occasions the library was refused status as a listed building after lobbying from Birmingham City Council. In February 2011 the library received a 5-year Certificate of Immunity from Listing after an application from Birmingham City Council, which meant it could not be protected from demolition until 2016. The library closed on 29 June 2013 and books and archives were moved across to the Library of Birmingham. Planning Application 2012/05116/PA was approved by the City Council on 8 February 2013.

The commercial outlets of Paradise Forum closed in January 2015, and the library site was fenced off except for the pedestrian route linking Chamberlain and Centenary Squares. Internal demolition of the library took place in the Summer and Autumn of 2015. On 1 November 2015, Paradise Forum was closed to pedestrians and Chamberlain Square was fenced off in preparation for external demolition. The first visible external demolition to the main library building began on 6 November 2015. On 15 November 2015 the road tunnel beneath the library permanently closed to traffic for demolition to progress. On 14 December 2015 the first exterior concrete panels to the reference library were removed to mark the start of significant exterior demolition. On 28 January 2016 the curved facade of the lending library began to be demolished and completed on 25 April 2016. The glass roof of the internal atrium was removed on 26 February 2016. At the beginning of August 2016 the link bridge to the museum was removed and the majority of the library building was demolished.

==Campaigns to save the building==
Several campaign groups were set up to save the library building from demolition. Groups such as Friends of Central Library, the Twentieth Century Society, English Heritage and World Monuments Fund supported the retention of the library.

English Heritage applied twice in 2002 and 2007 for the Central Library to be listed. On both occasions the Minister for Culture refused the application. On the second occasion, Margaret Hodge, the Minister for Culture, stated that &quot;the building did not have sufficient historical or architectural importance to merit listing&quot;. In 2009, following an application from Birmingham City Council for a Certificate of Immunity from Listing, Margaret Hodge signed the certificate which would be in place until 2016.

In 2011 the World Monuments Fund included the library on its watch list along with Preston bus station stating that the buildings were dramatically sited and uncompromising in their stark use of concrete and powerfully structural forms. They brought a sense of the monumental to the British urban landscape at the time of their construction and remain architectural icons. It was hoped that placing these buildings on the watch list would open dialogue into their protection and alternatives for adaptive reuse. Preston bus station was saved from demolition and listed at Grade II in September 2013; however dialogue on the demolition of the Central Library did not progress.

A fresh appreciation of the library began to emerge as the Council declared their intention to demolish it. The movement was led by artists and writers mainly of the 1960s generation who had grown up with it. Jonathan Meades appreciated the &quot;guts and attack&quot; of the library, and spoke negatively of the council&#x27;s policies, stating &quot;you don’t get a car and never get it serviced&quot;. Brutalist architecture was becoming more appreciated in the 21st Century with the listing of Preston bus station, Trellick Tower and the rejuvenation of Park Hill in Sheffield. Books celebrating brutalism were published and television shows featuring brutalist buildings began to feature with greater regularity. The Central Library was chosen to represent the location of MI5 HQ in BBC series &quot;The Game&quot;.

Friends of Central Library presented an alternative plan to the council and its developers which retained the library at the centre of the Paradise Circus scheme. It argued that the library could be used for a range of alternative uses and demolition after 40 years went against all principles of sustainability. However Birmingham City Council, Birmingham Civic Society, CABE and Argent strongly opposed any plans to retain the library and consequently the battle was lost.

<text>Positano (Campanian: ) is a village and &quot;comune&quot; on the Amalfi Coast (Province of Salerno), in Campania, Italy, mainly in an enclave in the hills leading down to the coast.

==History==
The first evidence of a settlement in Positano dates back to the Upper Palaeolithic, when the &quot;Grotto La Porta&quot; was frequented by gatherers and hunters. This small cave is located at 120 m. o.s.l. and at 10 m. on the highway. In 1955, Antonio M. Radmilli (University of Pisa) organized several surveys to identify prehistoric visits, both on the surface and in some caves. During the excavations, several fossils emerged, some of which are malacological like shells of molluscs, while the fauna is represented by the remains of mammals (wild boar, ibex, deer and roe deer), birds, amphibians and fish. The findings made it to be assumed that the people who frequented the caves had an economy based mainly on the collection of molluscs, while hunting for birds and mammals was rather marginal.

===Roman era===
The first archaeological evidence dates back to the first century BC, when luxurious Roman villas were built on the coast of the Sorrento Peninsula. Romans began settling at Positano around 100 B.C. In Positano, one occupied the bay and the other extended on the island of the Long Rooster, &quot;a typical example of how even more hidden spaces of a wild coast were used in the Claudian age without even respecting the rocks that, according to legend, would have served as the home of the sirens&quot;. These villas belong to the &quot;dispersed type&quot;, that is, formed by different structures not grouped together, delimited by gardens. The names of the owners are not yet known, but they are certainly elitist contexts. The Villa di Positano was described for the first time by Karl Weber in 1758, who then oversaw the excavations in Herculaneum and Pompeii. At the beginning of the 1900s, Mingazzini and Pfister carried out some essays to better understand the structure of both the bay of Positano and the Gallo Lungo. Maiuri describes some remains, still visible in the 1960s, as a peristilium of stuccoed brick columns. The complex has been the subject of systematic excavations since 2003, which have affected the area below the Oratory of the Santa Maria Assunta Church and, the site was inaugurated on 18 July 2018, with the name of MAR (Roman Archaeological Museum) Santa Maria Assunta Positano.

===Modern era===
Positano became a wealthy market port from the 15th to 17th century and has only continued to grow in popularity over time. Back then they traded food such as fish and other resources.

Positano was a port of the Amalfi Republic in medieval times, and prospered during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the town had fallen on hard times. More than half the population emigrated, mostly to America.

Positano was a relatively poor fishing village during the first half of the twentieth century. It began to attract large number of tourists in the 1950s, especially after John Steinbeck published his essay about Positano in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; in May 1953: &quot;Positano Bites Deep&quot;. Steinbeck wrote, &quot;It is a dream place that isn&#x27;t quite real when you are there and becomes beckoningly real after you have gone.&quot;

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
The climate of Positano is very mild, of the Mediterranean type; the winters are very warm with minimum temperatures that almost never fall below , while the summers are long, warm and sunny but often refreshed by the sea breeze.
Thanks to the mild temperature and the beauty of the landscape, Positano has been a holiday resort since the time of the Roman Empire, as evidenced by the discovery of a villa in the bay. Typical are the many staircases that from the top of the village connect the upper districts with the valley area. The main beaches are Spiaggia Grande, Fornillo, La Porta, Fiumicello, Arienzo, San Pietro, Laurito and Remmese, some of which can also be reached by sea.

==Main sights==


* The church of &quot;Santa Maria Assunta&quot; features a dome made of majolica tiles as well as a thirteenth-century Byzantine icon of a black Madonna. According to local legend, the icon had been stolen from Byzantium and was being transported by pirates across the Mediterranean. A storm had blown up in the waters opposite Positano and the frightened sailors heard a voice on board saying &quot;Posa, posa!&quot; (&quot;Put down! Put down!&quot;). The icon was unloaded and carried to the fishing village and the storm abated
* The Marina Grande beach is at the base of the cliff side town of Positano and is the most recognized beach in the town. Other popular beaches include Fornillo beach (the second largest beach in Positano) and Arienzo beach.
* MAR Positano (Roman Archaeological Museum) Santa Maria Assunta. The museum, inaugurated on 18 July 2018, is a museum-like archaeological site. The underground complex is divided into two crypts and a room of the Roman villa. The walls of the frescoed room from the imperial era are the only example of wall painting in Roman villas on the Amalfi Coast. The particularly bright colours are a peculiarity of the site. Further archaeological investigations are planned, aimed at the recovery of other rooms in the complex.

==Culture==
Positano has been featured in several films, including &quot;Only You&quot; (1994), and &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; (2003), as well as more recently in &quot;Kath &amp; Kimderella&quot; (2012) and being mentioned in the 2009 musical film &quot;Nine&quot; in the song &quot;Cinema Italiano&quot;. It has also hosted the annual &quot;Cartoons on the Bay Festival&quot;, at which Pulcinella Awards for excellence in animation are presented.

From July 1967 and through most of the 1970s, Positano was home to singer-songwriter Shawn Phillips and where most of his best-known work was composed. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards from The Rolling Stones wrote the song &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; in the cafes of Positano while on vacation.

Renowned director and producer Franco Zeffirelli owned the Villa Treville in Positano, where he took residence over a 35-year period and hosted a coterie of literati and stars of the stage and screen. He hired his friend, Renzo Mongiardino, who collaborated on many of his theater and opera projects, to design the exquisite interiors which reflect the local design sensibilities and craftsmanship. The Villa Treville has since been converted into a five-star boutique hotel.

German pianist Wilhelm Kempff made Positano his summer retreat and there he taught a summer course on the Beethoven piano sonatas and concerti. Since his death in 1991, the Beethoven Kurse has continued under the organization of the Wilhelm Kempff Kulturstiftung, having had as teachers Gerhard Oppitz and John O&#x27;Conor.

Today tourism is by far the major industry. Positano is also very popular for Limoncello and &quot;L&#x27;Albertissimo&quot;, an alcoholic tipple that can only be found at a small stall at the main harbor.

The town&#x27;s rapid growth from a small fishing village to an international destination is credited to the rise of the tourism industry. In addition to the beaches, cliffs, and historic sites, clothing stores and restaurants are scattered throughout Positano, attracting tourists from around the world. To complete the picture, natural lemon, orange, and olive groves grow prominently across the cliffside town. The produce is often sold in fresh markets around the city.

The fictional town of &quot;Mongibello&quot; in the 1955 novel &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; is based on Positano. The town and various villages on the islands of Ischia and Procida were used to represent Mongibello in a 1999 film based on the novel.

Positano is also home to football club A.S.D. San Vito Positano 1956, who play at Stadio Vittorio de Sica and compete in the Promozione Campania.

==Economy==
Positano is an international tourist attraction and it is also called &quot;città verticale&quot;due to its peculiar conformation. Since 1997 Positano is part of Amalfi Coast, in fact it has been declared UNESCO World Heritage site.
==Transportation==
Positano can be reached by the SS163 Amalfitana national road, or by the SP425 provincial road.
The nearest airports are the Napoli-Capodichino (NAP) and the Salerno-Pontecagnano Airport (QSR) and they have shuttle buses to destinations across the Amalfi Coast, including Positano.

Ferries link Positano to other towns including Capri, Naples, Salerno, and Sorrento for transportation.

The Sita bus links Positano to Amalfi and Sorrento.

==Education==
The community has a main nursery and primary school, the Montepertuso nursery, the Montepertuso primary school, and a secondary school.

==History==
===Yan&#x27;an period (1940–1946)===
Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) has its origins in the Yan&#x27;an Research Academy of Natural Sciences (延安自然科学研究院). BIT was established May 1939 in Yan&#x27;an, Shaanxi by the Chinese Communist Party with the aim of training science and engineering professionals. In January 1940 when China was undergoing the most difficult phase of the War of Resistance Against Japan the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party reformed the Yan&#x27;an Research Academy of Natural Sciences into the Yan&#x27;an Academy of Natural Sciences (延安自然科学院). The mission of the academy was to assist industrial development in the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region. Opened on 1 September 1940 it was the first science and engineering university founded by the Chinese Communist Party. Li Fuchun, secretary of the CCP Committee for Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, was appointed as the first president and was succeeded by educationist Xu Teli.

During the founding period the Yan&#x27;an Academy of Natural Sciences received support from international organizations and individuals including Rewi Alley.

In March 1943 the Yan&#x27;an Academy of Natural Sciences merged with the newly founded University of Yan&#x27;an (延安大学) and was named the School of Natural Sciences University of Yan&#x27;an (延安大学自然科学院).

At the end of 1945 the University of Yan&#x27;an moved to the north of China.

===Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region period (1946–1949)===
In January 1946 the School of Natural Sciences moved to Zhangjiakou. The Central Bureau of Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region decided to settle the School at Zhangjiakou and merged it with Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region College of Technology (晋察冀边区工科专门学校) to form the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region College (晋察冀边区工业专门学校).

At the end of the same year the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Institute moved to Hebei and merged with the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Academy of Railway (晋察冀边区铁路学院) to form the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region College of Industry and Transportation (晋察冀工业交通学院). One year later the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Institute moved to Jingxing County and was renamed the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Bureau of Industry College of Technology (晋察冀边区工业局工业学校). In August 1948 it merged with the Institute of Technology Northern University (北方大学工学院) to form the Institute of Technology North China University (华北大学工学院).

=== Institute of Technology North China University period (1949–1952) ===
The home campus of Sino-French University (中法大学) and its Departments of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry were merged into the Institute of Technology North China University in October 1950.

During the Cultural Revolution most research at Beijing Institute of Technology came to a halt but quickly resumed after 1976.

=== Post-economic reform period (1988–present) ===

On April 2, 1988, Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) was officially named and defined as a comprehensive university specializing in engineering while integrating science, management, and liberal arts. At that time, it comprised 16 departments and 33 majors, including vehicle engineering, applied physics, foreign languages, and industrial design. The university also housed 22 research institutes and 62 laboratories. In 1994, BIT established an institute dedicated to evaluating degree and postgraduate education.

<doc id="342926" wikidata="Q1612502" url="?curid=342926" title="The Flight of Dragons">
<text>The Flight of Dragons is a 1982 animated fantasy film produced and directed by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr. loosely combining the speculative natural history book of the same name (1979) by Peter Dickinson with the novel &quot;The Dragon and the George&quot; (1976) by Gordon R. Dickson. It stars the voices of John Ritter, Victor Buono (in his final role before his death), James Gregory, James Earl Jones, and Harry Morgan. The film centers upon a quest undertaken to stop an evil wizard who plans to rule the world by dark magic. A major theme within the story is the question of whether science and magic can co-exist. This is told mostly through the experience of character Peter Dickinson, drawn from the 20th century into the magical realm.

Released direct to video in the United Kingdom in September 1983, it was aired as an ABC &quot;Saturday Night Movie&quot; on August 2, 1986,and released by Warner Brothers as a made-to-order DVD in the US on 17 November 2009 as part of the &quot;Warner Archive Collection&quot;. The opening song is sung by Don McLean.

== Plot ==
In an age of medieval fantasy populated by fantastic creatures, the Green Wizard Carolinus, who presides over nature, notices that magic is fading from the world as humanity embraces logic and science instead. Summoning his three magical brothers, he proposes combining their powers to create a &quot;last realm of magic&quot; hidden from the rest of the world. The Blue Wizard Solarius, who commands the heavens and seas, and the Golden Wizard Lo Tae Zhao, whose realm is light and air, agree to the proposal. However, the Red Wizard Ommadon, master of black magic and the forces of evil, resolves instead to infect mankind with fear and greed, causing humans to use their science to destroy themselves.

Since the wizards are forbidden to fight among themselves, Carolinus proposes sending a group of heroes on a quest to steal Ommadon&#x27;s crown, which is the source of his power. The party includes the knight Sir Orrin Neville-Smythe and Carolinus&#x27; young dragon companion Gorbash. Solarius gives them an enchanted shield - The Shield of Saturn, which can deflect dark magic, and Lo Tae Zhao contributes a magic flute - The Flute of Olympus, which lulls dragons to sleep. Requiring a leader, Carolinus consults the magical force of Antiquity, which directs him to look 1,000 years into the future to find a man of science descended from a legendary hero. In late 20th century Boston Carolinus locates Peter Dickinson, a former scientist turned board game designer who is obsessed with dragons. Carolinus brings Peter back through time and enlists him in the quest, and Peter becomes enamored of Carolinus&#x27; ward, Princess Melisande. Ommadon sends his dragon Bryagh to capture Peter, and an accident with one of Carolinus&#x27; spells while rescuing him causes Peter to merge with Gorbash, Peter&#x27;s mind taking over the dragon&#x27;s body.

Knowing nothing about being a dragon, Peter is mentored by Carolinus&#x27; elder dragon companion, Smrgol. The dichotomy of magic and science is explored when Smrgol teaches Peter how dragons fly and breathe fire, abilities which Peter is able to explain with scientific principles. As the quest progresses, the heroes survive an attack by the monstrous Sandmurks and are joined by the talking wolf Aragh, the archer Danielle, and the elf Giles. As the party nears Ommadon&#x27;s realm, Danielle and Sir Orrin are captured by an ogre. Peter is nearly killed attempting to rescue them but is saved by Smrgol, who defeats the ogre at the cost of his own life. In the Red Wizard&#x27;s realm the party faces the Worm of Sligoff, which Peter destroys by igniting the sulfuric acid it excretes. Ommadon casts a spell to induce hopelessness in the group, which Peter repels using Solarius&#x27; shield. Ommadon next sends numerous dragons to kill the heroes, but Giles plays Lo Tae Zhao&#x27;s enchanted flute, lulling them and Peter to sleep. Bryagh remains awake and kills Giles, Aragh, and Danielle. Sir Orrin slays Bryagh, but dies from his wounds.

When Ommadon appears on the battlefield, Peter manages to separate himself from Gorbash by recalling the principle of impenetrability. He is able to defeat Ommadon by countering the wizard&#x27;s declarations of magic with explanations of science and logic, and denying the existence of magic. This destroys Ommadon, restores the other heroes to life, and allows the magical realm to take shape. Peter, having denied all magic, is separated forever from this realm, but not before awakening Melisande with a kiss and leaving her Ommadon&#x27;s crown. Having fallen in love with Peter, Melisande begs Carolinus to allow her to join him. Back in 20th century Boston, Peter is selling the magic flute and shield to a pawnbroker when Melisande enters the shop carrying the crown, and the two embrace.

== Crew ==
== Reception ==
Filmsy.com said of the film, &quot;Animated fantasy films geared for family viewing just aren’t made like this anymore... The voice acting in this movie is excellent, to say the least... Though the animation might seem a bit &#x27;dated&#x27;, it remains beautiful by 1982 standards&quot;. &quot;The dialogue is surprisingly intelligent and may confuse some children but it is nice to see an animated film that will stimulate adult minds a little... The voice cast are all great and I can’t find a single fault with any of them&quot;, said blogcritic.org. The Unknown Movies said &quot;There may not be a strong constant thread in &quot;The Flight of Dragons&quot;, but all its moments of warmth, imagination, and interest combine to make magic.&quot;

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;The Flight of Dragons&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;The Flight of Dragons is unsophisticated to say the least, but the Japanese animation includes some nice shimmering effects; and if, like Dickinson&#x27;s, your best character is a dragon, then this is for you.&quot;

Other reviews were less positive: &quot;I&#x27;m sure fans of &quot;The Flight of Dragons&quot;, sick of looking at crappy downloads or worn VHS copies, will be satisfied with what&#x27;s here, but if you didn&#x27;t grow up with this one, it&#x27;s best left alone.&quot;

== Home media ==
Various VHS editions of the film have been released since its debut in 1982. There was also a LaserDisc release from which some VHS copies were produced. The LaserDisc release was made by PolyGram Video in the United Kingdom, and there was also a Betamax release. In 1996, Warner Home Video released the film as part of the Warner Bros. Classic Tales VHS series, which was also available in Australia one year later. The Warner Archive Collection released the film on DVD on November 17, 2009. In December 2017, Warner Archive announced that they would be releasing the film on Blu-ray in 2018. The Blu-ray was released on January 16, 2018. The Blu-ray has the film in widescreen and has the original 4x3 standard definition version as a special feature.

== Soundtrack ==
The original score was composed by Maury Laws. The film&#x27;s theme song, also entitled &quot;The Flight of Dragons&quot;, was written and composed by Jules Bass and Maury Laws, and performed by Don McLean. An official soundtrack was never released.

<text>Short Brothers plc, usually referred to as Shorts or Short, is an aerospace company based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Shorts was founded in 1908 in London, and was the first company in the world to make production aeroplanes. It was particularly notable for its flying boat designs manufactured into the 1950s.

In 1943, Shorts was nationalised and later denationalised, and in 1948 moved from its main base at Rochester, Kent to Belfast. In the 1960s, Shorts mainly produced turboprop airliners, major components for aerospace primary manufacturers, and missiles for the British Armed Forces.

Shorts was primarily government-owned until being bought by Bombardier in 1989 and, in 2007, was the largest manufacturing concern in Northern Ireland. In November 2020, Bombardier sold its Belfast operations to Spirit AeroSystems.

The company&#x27;s products include aircraft components, engine nacelles and aircraft flight control systems for Bombardier Aerospace, Boeing, Rolls-Royce Deutschland, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney.

==History==

===Early years===
The Short Brothers business started in 1897 when Eustace Short (1875 – 1932) bought a second-hand coal gas filled balloon, and, with his brother Oswald, started a company to develop and manufacture balloons. In 1900, the two brothers visited the 1900 Paris Exposition (&#x27;World&#x27;s Fair&#x27;), where they saw the balloons of Édouard Surcouf (of Société Astra), who had developed a method of constructing truly spherical balloons.

In 1902, the brothers started offering balloons for sale. They manufactured the balloons at Hove, Sussex, in premises above the acoustic laboratory run by a third brother, Horace (2 July 1872 – 6 April 1917). In 1903, when Horace left to work on steam turbine development with Charles Parsons, Eustace and Oswald moved their workshop to rented accommodation in London, then again to railway arches in Battersea, conveniently situated next to Battersea gas-works.

In 1905, they won a contract for three balloons for the British Indian Army. The quality of their work impressed Colonel James Templer, superintendent of the Royal Balloon Factory, who introduced the brothers to Charles Rolls. Rolls commissioned them to build him a large balloon to compete in the 1906 Gordon Bennett Cup balloon race. More orders soon followed from other members of the Aero Club of Great Britain (later Royal Aero Club).

In 1908, on hearing reports from Aero Club members who had seen the Wright brothers&#x27; demonstrations of their aircraft at Le Mans in France, Oswald Short reportedly said to Eustace, &quot;This is the finish of ballooning: we must begin building aeroplanes at once, and we can&#x27;t do that without Horace!&quot; Oswald succeeded in persuading Horace to leave his job with Parsons, and in November 1908 they registered their partnership under the name Short Brothers. Two orders for aircraft were soon received, one from Charles Rolls, who ordered a glider, and the other from Francis McClean, a member of the Aero Club who later bought several more aircraft from Short Brothers, and also acted as an unpaid test-pilot. At the end of 1908 Horace started work on the two designs, and in early 1909 construction was started of McClean&#x27;s aircraft, the Short No.1 biplane. In March 1909 it was exhibited, without its fabric covering, at the first British Aero Show held at Olympia. Meanwhile, the brothers had obtained the British rights to build copies of the Wright design.

In February 1909, Shorts started construction of a new workshop on unobstructed marshland at Leysdown, near Shellbeach on the Isle of Sheppey. This had been acquired by the Aero Club for use as a flying ground, together with Mussell Manor (now known as &quot;Muswell Manor&quot;), which became its clubhouse. Construction of an initial batch of six aircraft was started immediately. Short Brothers thus became the first aircraft manufacturing company in the world to undertake volume production of an aircraft design. Here the Dunne D.5, the first tailless aircraft, was also built under contract. In 1910 the Royal Aero Club and Short Brothers moved to a larger and less marshy ground at Eastchurch, about 2.5 miles (4 km) away. At this time the Royal Aero Club had offered the Admiralty the use of the flying field and Frank McClean had agreed to act as an instructor, so beginning a close association between Short Brothers and the Naval Air Service, whose first pilots were trained using Short S.27 pusher biplanes.

In 1911, Shorts built one of the world&#x27;s first successful twin-engine aircraft, the Triple Twin. Construction started on a long series of naval aircraft floatplanes, starting with the Short S.26.

In 1913, Gordon Bell became Shorts&#x27; first professional test pilot: he was succeeded by Ronald Kemp in 1914. Kemp could not handle the volume of flight testing and development alone and, by 1916, other pilots were employed on a freelance basis. One of these was John Lankester Parker. In 1918 Parker succeeded Kemp as Shorts&#x27; Chief Test Pilot, a post he was to occupy for the next 27 years.

In 2013 a statue of the brothers was unveiled in memory of their contribution to early aviation, by local artist Barbara Street to stand on the site of the Aero Club clubhouse at Muswell manor. 
=== First World War ===
By the outbreak of World War I Shorts were already building a variety of aircraft. Production really started to expand during the war, for example for the Short Admiralty Type 184 (or simply &quot;Short S.184&quot;). On 15 August 1915, during the Battle of Gallipoli, a Short S.184 was the first aircraft to attack a ship with a live torpedo. Flying from HMS &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot;, piloted by Flight Commander Charles Edmonds, it hit a Turkish supply ship in the Dardanelles. In terms of number built, the S.184 was Shorts&#x27; most successful pre-Second World War aircraft: over 900 were produced, many under licence by other manufacturers. A landplane version of the S.184 was also sold to the Royal Flying Corps as the Short Bomber.

During the First World War, Shorts were among the manufacturers of two flying boats, the F.3 and F.5, designed by John Porte at the Seaplane Experimental Station, Felixstowe. When the war ended, some 50 of these were being built at Rochester.

==== Expansion at Rochester ====
Due to the company&#x27;s success, and the increasing number of seaplanes being produced, larger premises with ready access to the sea were needed. At that time, seaplanes were taken by road to Queenborough, then loaded onto lighters to be taken to the RNAS seaplane station on Isle of Grain to be launched and tested.
In 1913, an 8.4 acre (3.4 hectare) plot of land by the river Medway about 20 miles (32 km) away at Borstal, near Rochester, Kent, was purchased from Charles Willis (a local councillor), and the planning and construction work started.
By early 1915, the first facility of what was to become known as the Seaplane Works was completed: No.1 Erecting Shop. As this and the No.2 and No.3 shops became available, the workforce moved from the Eastchurch factory. No.3 shop was completed in 1917. A long concrete slipway was constructed from the centre-line of No.3 Erecting Shop to enable aircraft of up to 20 tons weight to be launched even at low tide.

====Airships at Cardington====
In 1916, Short Brothers was awarded a contract to build two large dirigible airships for the Admiralty. As part of the contract, a loan was provided to enable the company to purchase a site near Cardington, Bedfordshire, on which to build airship construction facilities. As a result, the company concentrated on the construction of heavier-than-air aeroplanes in the Isle of Sheppey/Rochester area, and balloons and dirigibles at Cardington. A housing estate built by the company near Cardington to house its employees still bears the name Shortstown.

In 1919, the name of the company was changed to Short Brothers (Rochester and Bedford) Ltd., but nationalisation the same year ended the Short brothers&#x27; involvement with the company, which became the Royal Airship Works.

===1920s and 1930s===
During the immediate post-war years the economic climate was difficult for the aircraft industry in the United Kingdom. Shorts survived without reducing the company&#x27;s workforce by diversifying into areas such as building lightweight bus and tram bodies.

During the 1920s and 1930s, flying boats were favoured for long-range civil aviation, because their operation did not rely on the existence of suitable airfields, which were not widespread at the time. Shorts took to the flying boat market, and in 1924 constructed a testing tank for testing hull and float designs. Shorts designed the floats used for the Supermarine S.4 and Gloster III seaplanes entered by the United Kingdom for the 1925 Schneider Trophy race. Alan Cobham&#x27;s de Havilland DH.50 (G-EBFO) was also fitted with Shorts floats at Rochester. On 30 June 1926, Cobham then started a flight to Australia from the Medway. Two de Havilland Giant Moths were fitted with Shorts floats at Rochester, and the first was flown in June 1928; both were delivered to Western Canada Airlines Ltd.

In 1924, Shorts produced the first of a series of three designs known as the Singapore. In 1927, the Singapore I was used by Sir Alan Cobham, when he, his wife, and crew made a survey of Africa which covered about 23,000 miles.

Shorts then started design work on the Short Calcutta, based on the Singapore layout but larger and more powerful, which began service with Imperial Airways in August 1928. By April 1929 two more had been added to the fleet, and they operated passenger-preferred coastal routes from Genoa to Alexandria by way of Athens, Corfu, Naples, and Rome. Several Calcuttas were used on shorter routes, and were instrumental in permitting long-range airline services between outposts of the British Empire. Shorts followed the production of four Calcuttas with the larger Kent, following with a series of still larger aircraft designs such as the Short Empire, the first of which was launched on 2 July 1936. The Empire was commissioned off the drawing board by Imperial Airways (later BOAC), to operate the UK&#x27;s Empire Airmail scheme.

A year later Shorts won a British government defence contract for the Sunderland military patrol flying boat. Sharing a similar design, but incorporating some aerodynamic and hydrodynamic advances, and a more rounded top of the fuselage that incorporated several gunner&#x27;s positions. Dreaded by U-boats, it was claimed by the British propaganda people that the Germans called it &quot;The Flying Porcupine&quot; (&quot;Fliegendes Stachelschwein&quot; in German), although no evidence supports their contention.

In 1933, Shorts opened a new factory at Rochester Airport, which was becoming increasingly important for the landplanes the company was producing. The Eastchurch premises was closed in 1934, and in the same year Shorts purchased the engine manufacturer Pobjoy, which had moved to Rochester Airport to be near Shorts and had collaborated on its latest designs.

On 5 July 1937, a Short Empire was used by Imperial Airways for the first westbound transatlantic service from Foynes, Ireland to Newfoundland.

===First moves to Belfast===
In 1936, the Air Ministry established a new aircraft factory at Belfast, and created a new company Short &amp; Harland Ltd, owned 50% each by Harland and Wolff and Shorts. The first products of the new factory were 50 Bristol Bombays followed by 150 Handley-Page Hereford bombers.

Shorts work on seaplanes eventually culminated in the Short Sandringham and Short Seaford, both based on the Empire/Sunderland boats. These flying boats had enough range to operate as a transatlantic airliner, but largely served the post-war Empire (Commonwealth) market, in competition with 4-engined land planes such as modified Avro Lancasters, Avro Lancastrian and Avro York.

Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL) operated the &quot;Coral Route&quot; from New Zealand to Fiji, the Cook Islands and Tahiti in the South Pacific, with Short Solent flying boats up to 1960.

===Second World War===

During the Battle of Britain, the Rochester factory was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe, and several Stirlings and other aircraft were destroyed, and during Easter week of 1941, Belfast and the aircraft factory were subjected to the worst single air-raid the UK had seen outside London. To prevent raids from limiting production, satellite factories near Belfast were operated at Aldergrove and Maghaberry, producing 232 Stirlings between them. A temporary Short&#x27;s factory was established at White Cross Bay, Windermere, that produced 35 Sunderland Mark IIIs. Austin Motors at Longbridge, Birmingham also produced over 600 Stirlings, and Blackburn Aircraft produced 240 Sunderlands at its shadow factory in Dumbarton, Scotland.

During the Second World War, the Short Sunderland was an effective anti-submarine patrol bomber operated by RAF Coastal Command in the Battle of the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, in Asia and the south Pacific because of its availability, endurance and weapon load. It also carried out air-sea rescue operations. In the absence of sufficient Sunderlands, Australia impressed Qantas-Imperial Short Empire flying boats into military service, and used these successfully especially on reconnaissance missions in the Timor Sea area.

A much enlarged transatlantic development of the Empire, the S.26 G-Class was developed, but only three completed before the war resulted in further production being cancelled.

Short&#x27;s work on the Sunderland also won it the contract for the Short Stirling four-engine bomber-transport for the RAF. This was essentially a land-based Sunderland, however its use of a now outdated thick-section, low aspect ratio wing to facilitate it going into service quickly limited climb and ceiling, and design decisions, such as the use of cells for individual bombs limited its long term usefulness as a heavy bomber when it proved incapable of carrying the newer larger bombs that didn&#x27;t fit in the cells. As it was intended as a stopgap pending the delivery of the Handley Page Halifax and Avro Manchester bombers, it followed the RAF tradition of also being a transport aircraft, with a cabin useful for troops and cargo, in which role it was used once the Halifax and Avro Lancaster were available in large enough numbers. Attempts by Shorts to sell improved versions to the RAF were ignored, not least over concerns regarding Oswald&#x27;s leadership and alcoholism.

In 1944, the Short Shetland, a high-speed, long-range, four-engined flying-boat, was built (with Saunders-Roe providing the wings and detail design work), but the project was abandoned shortly after the end of the war, however conversions and developments of the Sunderland entered service as transports, starting during the war with the Hythe, which was a demilitarized Sunderland with the turrets faired over, then the post-war Sandringham, which refined the shape to eliminate the turret mountings, and finally by the definitive Solent, with an enlarged tail and more powerful engines and other refinements derived from the stillborn wartime Seaford, which was to have been the penultimate Sunderland development.

In 1943, the Government nationalised Short&#x27;s under Defence Regulation 78. Oswald Short, who had resigned as Chairman in January of that year, remained as Honorary Life President.

===Postwar===

By 1947, all of Shorts other wartime factories had been closed, and operations concentrated in Belfast. In 1948, the company offices followed, and Shorts became a Belfast company in its entirety. In the meantime, in 1947, Short Brothers (Rochester and Bedford) Ltd. had merged with Short and Harland Limited to become Short Brothers and Harland Limited, with Oswald Short remaining as Life President.

In the 1950s, Shorts was involved in much pioneering research, including designing and building the VTOL Short SC1, the Short SB5 and the Short SB.4 Sherpa. Shorts built the Short Sperrin, a backup jet engine bomber design in case the V bomber projects failed, and the Short Seamew, a cheap-to-produce anti-submarine reconnaissance and attack aircraft intended for the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve squadrons, but the Sperrin was not needed and the RNVR squadrons disbanded. In the 1950s, Shorts also received sub-contracts to build 150 English Electric Canberras, and on 30 October 1952, the first of those made its maiden flight. Of these types, Shorts delivered 60 Canberra B.2s, 49 Canberra B.6s and 23 Canberra P.R.9s, the remaining 18 being cancelled by the Government in 1957. Further work was involved in the conversion of time-expired Canberra B.2s into unmanned radio-controlled missile target aircraft. Two prototypes and 10 production Canberra U.10s were produced, followed by six improved Canberra U.14s. These aircraft were controlled from the ground by VHF radio, and were equipped to provide feedback on their own performance, as well as that of the missiles aimed at them. As early as 1953, Shorts became involved with pioneering the development of electronic analogue computers, to assist with the design of increasingly complex aircraft.

In 1954, the Bristol Aeroplane Company became a 15.25% shareholder in Shorts, and the company used the injection of funds to set up a production line for the Bristol Britannia turbo-prop airliner, known in the press as &quot;The Whispering Giant&quot;. Although it was originally intended that 35 Britannias should be built by Shorts, a shortage of work at Bristol led to this number being reduced. Eventually, 15 Britannias were completed by Shorts; five sets of Britannia components were sent to Filton and used on the continued production there of Britannias.

In the 1960s, Shorts found a niche for a new short-haul freighter aircraft and responded with the Short SC.7 Skyvan. The Skyvan is most remembered for its box-like, slab-sided appearance and rectangular twin tail units, but the aircraft was well loved for its performance and loading. It served almost the same performance niche as the de Havilland Twin Otter, and the Skyvan proved more popular in the freighter market due to the large rear cargo door that allowed it to handle bulky loads with ease. Skyvans can still be found around the world today.

The heavy lift freighter Short SC.5 Belfast flew for the first time in 1964. Only 10 were built for the Royal Air Force. In the 1970s, Shorts entered the feederliner market with the Shorts 330, a stretched modification of the Skyvan, called the C-23 Sherpa in USAF service, and another stretch resulted in the more streamlined Shorts 360, in which a more conventional central fin superseded the older H-profiled twin fins.

In 1988, the proposed development was announced of a regional jet seating 44 passengers and to be called the FJX. The aircraft would have been a competitor to the Bombardier CRJ100 that was also in development at the time, but the FJX was cancelled after Short Brothers&#x27; sale to Bombardier.

=== Loyalist paramilitaries ===
In 1987 loyalists working at Shorts erected loyalist flags and bunting to intimidate the Catholic workers. The loyalist workers went on strike after management removed the loyalist flags from the shop floor.

In April 1989, three Northern Irish men, Noel Little, Samuel Quinn and James King, were arrested in Paris and later convicted of &quot;arms trafficking and associating with criminals involved in terrorist activities.&quot; They were accused of having stolen missile parts and documents related to Shorts&#x27; products. Also arrested were arms dealer Douglas Bernhardt and a South African diplomat.

In 1993 a Catholic sub-contractor at Shorts was shot dead and five others injured in a loyalist attack on a mini-bus full of Catholic workmen in an attack to discourage Catholics from taking jobs at Shorts.

===Belfast City Airport===
In 1937, Shorts established an airfield in central Belfast, beside the factory. This became Sydenham Airport and, from 1938 to 1939, was Belfast&#x27;s main civilian airport. During the Second World War, the airfield was requisitioned by the Royal Navy. Shorts continued to use the airfield until production of complete aircraft ceased, despite Nutts Corner, a former RAF base, becoming Belfast&#x27;s main airport (Nutts Corner was itself superseded in 1963 by Aldergrove). In 1983, following interest from airlines and customers, the airfield was opened for commercial flights as Belfast Harbour Airport (later Belfast City Airport (BCA), now George Best Belfast City Airport). Following major capital investment, Bombardier sold BCA for £35 million in 2003.

===Bombardier===
In 1977, the company changed its name back to Short Brothers, and in 1984 it became a public limited company in preparation for privatisation. The government announced the sale of Shorts to Bombardier on 7 June 1989 for £30 million. As part of the sale, the government agreed (at the insistence of then-Chancellor John Major) to write off £390 million of the company&#x27;s &quot;accumulated losses and inject another £390 million to recapitalise the group and cover current and future losses, capital investment and training.&quot;
Bombardier beat a bid from General Electric Company and Fokker. Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm had withdrawn before final offers were submitted.
The sale was finalised on 4 October 1989.

In 1993, with the company under the chairmanship of Sir Roy McNulty, Bombardier Shorts and Thomson-CSF formed a joint venture, Shorts Missile Systems, for the design and development of very short-range, air defence missiles for the UK Ministry of Defence and armed forces worldwide using expertise dating back to the 1950s. In 2000, Thomson-CSF bought Bombardier&#x27;s 50% share to become the sole owner of Shorts Missile Systems, renaming it Thales Air Defence in 2001.

===Spirit AeroSystems===
On 31 October 2019, Bombardier announced the sale of its aerostructures activities to Spirit AeroSystems. The sale closed in November 2020 following regulatory approval and a renegotiated price due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Year of first flight in parentheses. Some of the early aircraft are designated using the Short sequence or constructors number which should not be confused with the similar type designations started at S.1 in 1924. Since becoming part of Bombardier Aerospace in 1989, focus is aerospace components rather than individual aircraft models, missiles or drones.

<text>A maritime patrol aircraft (MPA), also known as a patrol aircraft, maritime [[reconnaissance aircraft]], maritime surveillance aircraft, or by the older American term patrol bomber, is a fixed-wing aircraft designed to operate for long durations over water in maritime patrol roles — in particular anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-ship warfare (AShW), and search and rescue (SAR).

Among other maritime surveillance resources, such as satellites, ships, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and helicopters, the MPA is an important asset. To perform ASW operations, MPAs typically carry air-deployable sonar buoys as well as torpedoes and are usually capable of extended flight at low altitudes.

==History==
=== First World War ===
The first aircraft that would now be identified as maritime patrol aircraft were flown by the Royal Naval Air Service and the French Aéronautique Maritime during the First World War, primarily on anti-submarine patrols. France, Italy and Austria-Hungary used large numbers of smaller patrol aircraft for the Mediterranean, Adriatic and other coastal areas while the Germans and British fought over the North Sea. At first, blimps and zeppelins were the only aircraft capable of staying aloft for the longer ten hour patrols whilst carrying a useful payload while shorter-range patrols were mounted with landplanes such as the Sopwith 1½ Strutter. A number of specialized patrol balloons were built, particularly by the British, including the SS class airship of which 158 were built including subtypes.

As the conflict continued, numerous aircraft were developed specifically for the role, including small flying boats such as the FBA Type C, as well as large floatplanes such as the Short 184, or flying boats such as the Felixstowe F.3. Developments of the Felixstowe served with the Royal Air Force until the mid 20s, and with the US Navy as the Curtiss F5L and Naval Aircraft Factory PN whose developments saw service until 1938. During the war, Dornier did considerable pioneering work in all aluminium aircraft structures while working for Luftschiffbau Zeppelin and built four large patrol flying boats, the last of which, the Zeppelin-Lindau Rs.IV, influenced development elsewhere resulting in the replacement of wooden hulls with metal ones, such as on the Short Singapore. The success of long range patrol aircraft led to the development of fighters specifically designed to intercept them, such as the Hansa-Brandenburg W.29.

=== Second World War ===

Many of the Second World War patrol airplanes were converted from either bombers or airliners, such as the Lockheed Hudson which started out as the Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra, as well as older biplane designs such as the Supermarine Stranraer, which had begun to be replaced by monoplanes just before the outbreak of war. The British in particular used obsolete bombers to supplement purpose-built aircraft for maritime patrol, such as the Vickers Wellington and Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley, while the US relegated the Douglas B-18 Bolo to the same role until better aircraft became available. Blimps were widely used by the United States Navy, especially in the warmer and calmer latitudes of the Caribbean Sea, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Gulf of Mexico, Puerto Rico, Trinidad, and later the Azores.

A number of special-purpose aircraft were also used in the conflict, including the American-made twin-engine Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats, and the large, four-engine British Short Sunderland flying boats of the Allies. In the Pacific theatre, the Catalina was gradually superseded by the longer-ranged Martin PBM Mariner flying boat. For the Axis Powers, there were the long-range Japanese Kawanishi H6K and Kawanishi H8K flying boats, and the German Blohm &amp; Voss BV 138 diesel-engined trimotor flying boat, as well as the converted Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor airliner landplane.

To finally close the Mid-Atlantic gap, or &quot;Black Gap&quot;, a space in which Axis submarines could prey on Allied shipping out of reach of MPAs, the British Royal Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force, and the US Army Air Forces introduced the American Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber, which had a very long range for the era. The B-24 was also used at the basis for the PB4Y-2 Privateer, a dedicated MPA variant adopted in large numbers by the US Navy, which saw service late on in the Pacific theatre.

During the conflict, there were several developments in air-to-surface-vessel radar and sonobuoys, which enhanced the ability of aircraft to find and destroy submarines, especially at night and in poor weather. Another area of advancement was the adoption of increasingly effective camouflage schemes, which led to the widespread adoption of white paint schemes in the Atlantic to reduce the warning available to surfaced U-boats, while US Navy aircraft transitioned from an upper light blue-gray and lower white to an all-over dark blue due to the increasing threat of Japanese forces at night-time.

=== Cold War era ===
In the decades following the Second World War, the MPA missions were partially taken over by aircraft derived from civilian airliners. These had range and performance factors better than most of the wartime bombers. The latest jet-powered bombers of the 1950s did not have the endurance needed for long, overwater patrolling, and they did not have the low loitering speeds necessary for antisubmarine operations. The main threat to NATO maritime supremacy throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and the 1980s was Soviet Navy and Warsaw Pact submarines. These were countered by the NATO fleets, the NATO patrol planes mentioned above, and by sophisticated underwater listening systems. These span the so-called &quot;GIUK Gap&quot; of the North Atlantic that extends from Greenland to Iceland, to the Faroe Islands, to Scotland in the United Kingdom. Air bases for NATO patrol planes have also been located in these areas: U.S. Navy and Canadian aircraft based in Greenland, Iceland, and Newfoundland; British aircraft based in Scotland and Northern Ireland; and Norwegian, Dutch, and German aircraft based in their home countries.

During the late 1940s, the RAF introduced the Avro Shackleton a specialised MPA derivative of the Avro Lancaster bomber in anticipation of a rapid expansion of the Soviet Navy&#x27;s submarine force. 
An improved model of the Shackleton, the &quot;MR 3&quot;, was introduced, featuring various structural improvements, along with homing torpedoes and Mk 101 Lulu nuclear depth bombs. During the late 1960s, a jet-powered replacement in the form of the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod, a derivation of the De Havilland Comet airliner, begun to be introduced. During the 2000s, an improved model, the BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4, was in development, but was cancelled and eventually substituted for by the Boeing P-8 Poseidon.

The U.S. Navy flew a mixture of MPAs, including the land-based Lockheed P2V Neptune (P2V) and the carrier-based Grumman S-2 Tracker. During the 1970s, the P2V was entirely replaced by the Lockheed P-3 Orion, which remained in service into the early twenty-first century.

The P-3, powered by four turboprop engines, is derived from the 1950s era Lockheed Electra airliner. In addition to their ASW and SAR capabilities, most P-3Cs have been modified to carry Harpoon and Maverick missiles for attacking surface ships. American P-3s were formerly armed with the Lulu nuclear depth charge for ASW, but those were removed from the arsenal and scrapped decades ago. Produced in United States, Japan and Canada, the P-3 has been operated by the air forces and navies of United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, Iran, Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, and Taiwan. The Canadian version is called the CP-140 Aurora.

During the 1960s, in response to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a new MPA, the Breguet 1150 Atlantic was developed by a French-led multinational consortium, &quot;Société d&#x27;Étude et de Construction de Breguet Atlantic&quot; (SECBAT). Operators of the type include the French Navy, the German Navy, the Italian Air Force, the Pakistan Navy, and the Royal Netherlands Navy. During the 1980s, an updated version, the &quot;Atlantic Nouvelle Génération&quot; or &quot;Atlantique 2&quot;, with new equipment and avionics was introduced, which included a new radar, sonar processor, forward-looking infrared camera turret, and the ability to carry the Exocet anti-shipping missile. By 2005, French manufacturer Dassault Aviation had decided to terminate marketing efforts for the Atlantic, promoting a MPA variant of the Dassault Falcon 900 corporate jet instead.

Japan has developed multiple purpose-designed MPAs during this period. The Shin Meiwa PS-1 flying boat was designed to meet a Japanese requirement for a new ASW platform. A modernised derivative of the PS-1, the ShinMaywa US-2 amphibian, was introduced during the early twenty-first century to succeed the PS-1. The land-based Kawasaki P-1 was introduced during the 2010s by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) as a replacement for the aging P-3C Orion.

Both the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy met their early postwar MPA needs via a stretched-fuselage modification of the Avro Lincoln bomber. However, the type was soon supplemented and eventually replaced by new aircraft, such as the P2V and later the P-3C, which later became the sole ASW type operated by the service.

The Soviet Union developed the Ilyushin Il-38 from a civilian airliner. Similarly, the Royal Canadian Air Force derived the Canadair CP-107 Argus from a British airliner, the Bristol Britannia. The Argus was superseded by the CP-140 Aurora, derived from the Lockheed Electra.

Since the end of the Cold War, the threat of a large-scale submarine attack is a remote one, and many of the air forces and navies have been downsizing their fleets of patrol planes. Those still in service are still used for search-and-rescue, counter-smuggling, antipiracy, antipoaching of marine life, the enforcement of the exclusive economic zones, and enforcement of the laws of the seas.

==Armament and countermeasures==

The earliest patrol aircraft carried bombs and machine guns. Between the wars the British experimented with equipping their patrol aircraft with the COW 37 mm gun. During World War II, depth charges that could be set to detonate at specific depths, and later when in proximity with large metal objects replaced anti-submarine bombs that detonated on contact. Patrol aircraft also carried defensive armament which was necessary when patrolling areas close to enemy territory such as Allied operations in the Bay of Biscay targeting U-boats starting out from their base.

As a result of Allied successes with patrol aircraft against U-boats, the Germans introduced U-&quot;flak&quot; (submarines equipped with more antiaircraft weaponry) to escort U-boats out of base and encouraged commanders to remain on the surface and fire back at attacking craft rather than trying to escape by diving. However, U-flak was short-lived, as opposing pilots adapted their tactics. Equipping submarines with radar warning receivers and the snorkel made them harder to find.

To counter the German long-range patrol aircraft that targeted merchant convoys, the Royal Navy introduced the &quot;CAM ship&quot;, which was a merchant vessel equipped with a lone fighter plane which could be launched once to engage the enemy planes. Later, the small escort carriers of WWII became available to cover the deep oceans, and the land air bases in the Azores became available in mid-1943 from Portugal.

As technology progressed the bombs and depth charges were supplemented with Acoustic torpedoes that could detect, follow and then explode against an enemy submarine. The US Navy began fielding the Mark 24 mine in 1943, labelled as a mine as a security measure. It sank 37 Axis submarines during the war.

The Cold War era saw the introduction of the nuclear depth bomb, a depth charge with a nuclear warhead that raised the probability of a kill against a submarine to a near-certainty as long as detonation occurred.

While anti-submarine warfare is the main role of patrol aircraft, their large payload capability has seen them fitted for various weaponry outside their nominal role. The Lockheed P-3 Orion was fitted with underwing pylons that could carry a variety of common American weapons, including the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile, the air-to-ground AGM-65 Maverick, as many as ten of the CBU-100 Cluster Bomb, rocket pods, sea mines, and the standard issue Mark 80 general purpose bombs.

The Royal Air Force&#x27;s Hawker Siddeley Nimrod was fitted with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles in 1982 during the Falklands War in order for it to be able to attack any Argentine Air Force patrol planes they might encounter.

==Sensors==
Maritime patrol aircraft are typically fitted with a wide range of sensors:
* Radar to detect surface shipping movements. Radar can also detect a submarine snorkel or periscope, and the wake it creates.
* Magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) to detect the iron in a submarine&#x27;s hull. The MAD sensor is typically mounted on an extension from the tail or is trailed behind the aircraft on a cable to minimize interference from the metal in the rest of the aircraft;
* Sonobuoys - self-contained sonar transmitter/receivers dropped into the water to transmit data back to the aircraft for analysis;
* ELINT sensors to monitor communications and radar emissions;
* Infrared cameras (sometimes referred to as FLIR for forward looking infrared) for detecting exhaust streams and other sources of heat and are useful in monitoring shipping movements and fishing activity.
* Visual inspection using the aircrew&#x27;s eyes, in some cases aided by searchlights or flares.

A modern military maritime patrol aircraft typically carries a dozen or so crew members, including relief flight crews, to effectively operate the equipment for 12 hours or more at a time.

<text>Kristen Britain (born October 18, 1965) is an American author. She is the author of the fantasy series &quot;Green Rider&quot; which includes the eponymous first volume (nominated for the Crawford Award), &quot;First Rider&#x27;s Call&quot;, &quot;The High King&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, &quot;Blackveil&quot; (nominated for the David Gemmell Legend Award), and &quot;Mirror Sight&quot;. 

==Early life and education==
Britain grew up in the Finger Lakes region of New York State, where she started her first novel — an undersea fantasy featuring herself and her friends — at the age of nine. She published her first book, a cartoon collection called &quot;Horses and Horsepeople&quot;, at the age of thirteen.

After completing her degree in film production, with a minor in writing, at Ithaca College in 1987, she went to work for the National Park Service in 1988 after a conversation with a park ranger during a visit to Women&#x27;s Rights National Historical Park.

Britain currently resides in Maine.

==Career==
Her first ranger job was a seasonal position at Clara Barton National Historic Site in Maryland. 
At the time of the publication of her first novel, &quot;Green Rider&quot;, she was working full-time as a park ranger at Acadia National Park, and she drew much of the inspiration for the landscape of Sacoridia from the park. Her many years as a park ranger enabled her to work in a variety of natural and historical settings, from 300 feet below the surface of the Earth to 13,000 feet above sea level on the Continental Divide; and from the textile mills of the American Industrial Revolution to the homes of Americans who changed the course of history.

Kristen Britain&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Green Rider&quot;, was published by DAW Books in November 1998. It was acclaimed as an influential work of fantasy fiction and nominated for the Locus Award for Best First Novel and the William L. Crawford - IAFA Fantasy Award, or Crawford Award. &quot;Green Rider&quot; introduces us to Karigan, &quot;a young woman who went from being expelled from school to entering a world filled with dangerous magic.&quot; The book grew into a series of nine books (as of 2024) comprising an epic fantasy adventure based in a medieval world called Sacoridia. The fourth volume in the series, &quot;Blackveil&quot;, was nominated for the 2011 Goodreads Fantasy Award.

<text>Mulready stationery describes the postal stationery letter sheets and envelopes that were introduced as part of the British Post Office postal reforms of 1840. They went on sale on 1 May 1840, and were valid for use from 6 May. The Mulready name arises from the fact that William Mulready, a well-known artist of the time, was commissioned to illustrate the part of the letter sheets and envelopes which corresponded with the face area.

==Design==
The design incorporated a munificent Britannia at the centre top with a shield and a reclining lion surrounded on either side by a representation of the continents of Asia and North America with people reading their mail in the two lower corners, bestowing the benefits of mail services to the countries of the world under British control. The Mulready illustration, engraved by John Thompson, was printed such that it appeared on the face of the sheets when folded. The Mulready letter sheets followed the traditional letter sheet design and could be folded as normal while the envelopes were a diamond-shaped sheet which, when the sides were folded to the center, became an envelope and the overlapping edges were then sealed.

The Mulready illustration was effectively a very elaborate frank indicating that postage had been pre-paid. In the same way that the first postage stamps were issued in two values (Penny Black and Two Penny Blue) both the letter sheets and envelopes were issued in sheets of twelve, called Formes. The one penny and two penny values were in the same black and blue colours as the same value postage stamps.

The design was to write on the inside or to enclose a letter written on ordinary paper. The Mulready letter sheet was fundamentally akin to the present-day aerogram.

Pre-gummed envelopes as we know them today did not exist. The diamond-shaped sheet and the geometrically more complex short-arm cross-shaped sheet remain essentially the staple designs to this day. (All mechanical printing devices from the Gutenberg press on are primarily designed to process flat rectangular sheets. Hence the illustration would have been printed using a press and then cut to a diamond shape. The number produced from any one sheet naturally depended on the size of the printing bed and to this day envelope printing and envelope manufacture have maintained a symbiotic relationship.)

==Demise==

Rowland Hill expected the Mulready stationery to be more popular than the postage stamps but the postage stamp prevailed. The design was so elaborate and misunderstood that it generated widespread ridicule and lampooning, and in addition was perceived in some areas as a covert government attempt to control the supply of envelopes, and hence control the flow of information carried by the postal service (which had become a government monopoly under the reforms). Many caricatures (or lampoons) were produced by stationers whose livelihood was threatened by the new letter sheet. Only six days after their introduction, on 12 May, Hill wrote in his journal: &quot;I fear we shall have to substitute some other stamp for that design by Mulready ... the public have shown their disregard and even distaste for beauty.&quot;

Within two months a decision had been made to replace the Mulready designed stationery and essentially they were a folly. As a result of the uproar the Mulreadys were replaced with a simple design which is commonly known as the Penny Pink. The Penny Pinks were issued on 10 February 1841. Contrary to often published accounts, the Mulreadys were not withdrawn at that time. Supplies in post offices were eventually exhausted. Large supplies remained in the hands of stamp distributors and sub-distributors. In November 1842, the Inland Revenue decided that those stocks should be withdrawn. The withdrawal notice was sent gradually over a period of time so that the store keepers at Inland Revenue would not be overwhelmed with the volume of returned Mulreadys. The withdrawal period lasted several years. The returned Mulreadys were stored at a warehouse until it was decided to destroy them. The first attempt was to burn them, using close stoves out of fear of robbery, but this failed. Eventually a machine was designed and built to destroy them by punching out the center of the design.

<text> (; &#x27;Drive to the East&#x27;, or &#x27;push eastward&#x27;, &#x27;desire to push east&#x27;) was the name for a 19th-century German nationalist intent to expand Germany into Slavic territories of Central and Eastern Europe. In some historical discourse, combines historical German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe, medieval (12th to 13th century) military expeditions such as those of the Teutonic Knights (the Northern Crusades), and Germanisation policies and warfare of modern German states such as those that implemented Nazism&#x27;s concept of &quot;Lebensraum&quot;. 

In Polish works the term could refer to programs for the Germanization of Poland, while in 19th-century Germany the slogan was used variously of a wider nationalist approbation of medieval German settlement in the east and the idea of the &quot;superiority of German culture&quot;. In the years after World War I the idea of a (&#x27;drive to the west&#x27;), an alleged Polish drive westward—an analogy of —circulated among German authors in reaction to the loss of eastern territories and the Polish Corridor. 

The concept of &quot;Drang nach Osten&quot; became a core element of Nazi ideology. In &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; (1925–1926), Adolf Hitler declares the idea to be an essential element of his reorganisation plans for Europe. He states: &quot;It is eastwards, only and always eastwards, that the veins of our race must expand. It is the direction which nature herself has decreed for the expansion of the German peoples.&quot;

==Origin of the term==
The first known use of was by the Polish journalist Julian Klaczko in 1849, yet it is debatable whether he invented the term as he used it in form of a citation. Because the term is used almost exclusively in its German form in English, Polish, Russian, Czech and other languages, it has been concluded that the term is of German origin.

==Background==

During the 19th and the early 20th century has been associated with the medieval German , the High Medieval migration period of ethnic Germans to Eastern Europe, inhabited by Slavs, Balts, and Finno-Ugrics. This movement caused legal, cultural, linguistic, religious and economic changes, that had a profound influence on the history of Eastern Europe between the Baltic Sea and the Carpathians.

Massive population increase during the High Middle Ages left increasing numbers of commoners like peasants, craftsmen and artisans displaced, who were joined by nobility not entitled to land inheritance, stimulating the movement of settlers from territories of the Holy Roman Empire, such as the Rhineland, Flanders and Saxony into the sparsely-populated East. These movements were supported by the Slavic kings and dukes and the Church.

The future state of Prussia, named for the conquered Old Prussians, had its roots largely in these movements. As the Middle Ages came to a close, the Teutonic Knights, who had been invited to northern Poland by Konrad of Masovia, had assimilated and forcibly converted much of the southern Baltic coastlands.

After the Partitions of Poland by the Kingdom of Prussia, Austria, and the Russian Empire in the late 18th century, Prussia gained much of western Poland. The Prussians, and later the Germans, engaged in a policy of Germanization in Polish territories. Russia and Sweden eventually conquered the lands taken by the Teutonic Knights in Estonia and Livonia.

== in German discourse==
The term became a centerpiece of the program of the German nationalist movement in 1891, with the founding of the Alldeutscher Verband, in the words: (&#x27;The old must be revived&#x27;).
Nazi Germany employed the slogan in calling the Czechs a &quot;Slav bulwark against the &quot; in the 1938 .

Despite policies, population movement took place in the opposite direction also, as people from rural, less developed areas in the East were attracted by the prospering industrial areas of Western Germany. This phenomenon became known by the German term , literally &#x27;flight from the East&#x27;.

With the development of romantic nationalism in the 19th century, Polish and Russian intellectuals began referring to the German as . The German Empire and Austria-Hungary attempted to expand their power eastward; Germany by gaining influence in the declining Ottoman Empire (the Eastern Question) and Austria-Hungary through the acquisition of territory in the Balkans (such as Bosnia and Herzegovina).
German nationalists called for a new to oppose what they conceived as a Polish (&#x27;thrust toward the West&#x27;). 

The Polish paper used both and in August 2002 to title stories about the German company RWE taking over the Polish STOEN and Polish migration into eastern Germany, respectively.

 is also the ironic title of a chapter in Eric Joseph Goldberg&#x27;s book &quot;Struggle for Empire&quot;, used to point out the &quot;missing&quot; eastward ambitions of Louis the German who instead expanded his kingdom to the West.

==Lebensraum concept of Nazi Germany==
Adolf Hitler, dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933–1945, advocated for a to acquire territory for German colonists at the expense of central and eastern European nations (). The term, by then, had gained enough currency to appear in foreign newspapers without explanation. Nazi propaganda depicted Eastern Europe as historically Germanic territories, promoting the myth that these regions were stolen from Aryan races by Hunnic and Avar tribes. Hitler viewed Slavs as primitive subhumans and for this reason detested the German empire&#x27;s alliance with Austria-Hungary during World War I. In his works such as &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and &quot;Zweites Buch&quot;, Hitler viewed the Slavs as lacking the capability to form a state. 

Anti-Slavism was also a core doctrine of Nazi ideology, which considered Slavs to be racially inferior &quot;Untermensch&quot;. Through the &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; (&quot;General Plan for the East&quot;), Nazi Germany sought the total domination by Germanic peoples of Eastern Europe by conducting a genocide of Slavic inhabitants and forcibly deporting rest of the population beyond the Urals. After Nazi Germany&#x27;s initiation of Operation Barbarossa, the propaganda of Axis powers described the military campaign as a &quot;European crusade against Bolshevism&quot; to foreign powers. Meanwhile, Nazi Germany&#x27;s domestic propaganda depicted the war as a racial struggle of Aryans against &quot;Jewish and Slavic &quot;Untermenschen&quot;&quot; to annihilate &quot;Judeo-Bolshevism&quot;. The Reich Security Main Office, under Heinrich Himmler, played an active role in distributing racist propaganda pamphlets on these topics across German-occupied territories.

Nazi Germany&#x27;s eastern campaigns during World War II were initially successful with the conquests of Poland, the Baltic countries, Belarus, Ukraine and much of European Russia by the ; was implemented by Nazi forces to eliminate the native Slavic peoples from these lands and replace them with Germans. The , or soldier-peasants, would settle in a fortified line to prevent civilization arising beyond and threatening Germany.

This was greatly hindered by the lack of German people who desired to settle in the east, let alone act as Teutonic Knights there. Settlements established during the war did not receive colonists from the , but in the main part East European Germans resettled from Soviet &quot;spheres of interest&quot; according to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, and such Poles as deemed Germanizable by Nazis. However, the Soviet Union began to reverse the German conquests by 1943. Nazi Germany was defeated by the Allies in 1945.

==Expulsion of Germans from the East after World War II==

Most of the demographic and cultural outcome of the was terminated after World War II. The expulsion of Germans after World War II east of the line in 1945–48 on the basis of decisions of the Potsdam Conference were later justified by their beneficiaries as a rollback of the . &quot;Historical Eastern Germany&quot;—historically the land of the Baltic people called Old Prussians who had been colonized and assimilated by German —was split between Poland, Russia, and Lithuania (a Baltic country) and repopulated with settlers of the respective ethnicities. The Old Prussians were conquered by the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century, and gradually assimilated over the following centuries; the Old Prussian language was extinct by the 17th or early 18th century. Henry Cord Meyer, in his book &quot;: Fortunes of a Slogan-Concept in German–Slavic Relations, 1849–1990&quot; claims that the slogan originated in the Slavic world, and it also was more widely used than in Germany.

<text>William James Bloye (8 July 1890 – 6 June 1975) was an English sculptor, active in Birmingham either side of World War II. After serving in World War I, Bloye studied and later taught at the Birmingham School of Art. Becoming a member of the Birmingham Civic Society in 1925, he played a significant role as Birmingham&#x27;s unofficial civic sculptor, contributing to various public commissions. Bloye was a member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors, attaining the status of fellow in 1938. His association with the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (RBSA) included serving as its president from 1948 to 1950 and as the Professor of Sculpture. He retired in 1956 and died away in 1975.

==Life==

Bloye studied, and later, taught at the Birmingham School of Art (his training was interrupted by World War I, when he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps from 1915 to 1917; he was eventually succeeded at Birmingham by John Bridgeman), where his pupils included Gordon Herickx, Roy Kitchin, Raymond Mason, John Poole and Ian Walters. He also studied stone-carving and letter cutting under Eric Gill around 1921.

In 1925 Bloye became a member of the Birmingham Civic Society, having, at about that time, a studio at 111, Golden Hillock Road, Small Heath, Birmingham. As Birmingham&#x27;s unofficial civic sculptor he worked on virtually all public commissions including libraries, hospitals and the University. He often carved bas-relief plaques, typically for public houses in Birmingham, and decorated a number of buildings by the architect Holland W. Hobbiss. During the 1920s, he served on the Technical Committee of the Birmingham Civic Society.

Bloye became a member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors: associate (with the honorific suffix ARBS) in 1934, and fellow (FRBS) in 1938. He also won the latter&#x27;s Otto Beit Medal. Retiring from the School of Art in 1956 he moved to Solihull. He died in Arezzo, Italy in 1975.

In December 2010, a blue plaque was unveiled at City College, on the site of his former studio.

As of January 2010, Birmingham City Council are working on the restoration of Bloye&#x27;s statue of Pan at Aston Hall. The statue&#x27;s head is missing, and they have appealed for old photographs to assist in its reconstruction.

== Royal Birmingham Society of Artists ==

Bloye was closely associated with the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists. Although the two 1919 bronze plaques at the RBSA entrance are the earliest known work by Bloye in Birmingham, he became a member only in 1930. After a period as vice-president, he became president in 1948 and served in that role until 1950. He was also the RBSA&#x27;s Professor of Sculpture from at least the mid-1940s until at least 1961 (after which time the post is no longer mentioned in the annual catalogues).

The Society&#x27;s permanent collection includes one of his works, a life-size plaster bust, &quot;Head of Man&quot;. It is undated and not usually on display. The subject&#x27;s name is not recorded.

<text>Mercy Otis Warren (September 25, 1728 – October 19, 1814) was an American activist poet, playwright, and pamphleteer during the American Revolution. During the years before the Revolution, she had published poems and plays that attacked royal authority in Massachusetts and urged colonists to resist British infringements on colonial rights and liberties. She was married to James Warren, who was likewise heavily active in the independence movement.

During the debate over the United States Constitution in 1788, she issued a pamphlet, &quot;Observations on the new Constitution, and on the Federal and State Conventions,&quot; written under the pseudonym &quot;A Columbian Patriot&quot;, that opposed ratification of the document and advocated the inclusion of a Bill of Rights. &quot;Observations&quot; was long thought to be the work of other writers, most notably Elbridge Gerry. It was not until one of her descendants, Charles Warren, found a reference to it in a 1787 letter to British historian Catharine Macaulay that Warren was accredited authorship. In 1790, she published a collection of poems and plays under her own name, an unusual occurrence for a woman at the time. In 1805, she published one of the earliest histories of the American Revolution, a three-volume &quot;History of the Rise, Progress, and Termination of the American Revolution&quot;.

==Early life==

Warren was born on September 25, 1728, the third of thirteen children and the first daughter of Colonel James Otis (1702–1778) and Mary (Allyne) Otis (1702–1774). The family lived in Barnstable, Massachusetts. Her mother was a descendant of &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger Edward Doty. Her father was a farmer and attorney, who served as a judge for the Barnstable County Court of Common Pleas. He won election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1745. He was an outspoken opponent of British rule and the appointed colonial governor, Thomas Hutchinson.

The Otis children were &quot;raised in the midst of revolutionary ideals&quot;. Although Mercy had no formal education, she studied with the Reverend Jonathan Russell while he tutored her brothers Joseph and James in preparation for college. Her father also had unconventional views of his daughter&#x27;s education, as he fully supported her endeavors, which was extremely unusual for the 18th century. Her brother James attended Harvard College and became a noted patriot and lawyer. What little of his correspondence with Mercy survives suggests that James encouraged Mercy&#x27;s academic and literary efforts, treating her as an intellectual equal and confidante.

==Marriage and children==
Mercy Otis married James Warren on November 14, 1754. After settling in Plymouth, James inherited his father&#x27;s position as sheriff. His previous occupations included farming and merchanting. Throughout their lives, they wrote letters of respect and admiration to each other. These exchanges of adoration showed both a mutual respect and an enduring bond between the two. James would write from Boston, &quot;I have read one Excellent Sermon this day &amp; heard two others. What next can I do better than write to a Saint,&quot; and Mercy would then respond, &quot;Your spirit I admire - were a few thousands on the Continent of a similar disposition we might defy the power of Britain.&quot; They had five sons, James (1757–1821), Winslow (1759–1791), Charles (1762–1784), Henry (1764–1828), and George (1766–1800).

Her husband James had a distinguished political career. In 1766, he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He became speaker of the House and president of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. He also served as paymaster to George Washington&#x27;s army for a time during the American Revolutionary War.

Their Plymouth home was often a meeting place for local politics and revolutionaries including the Sons of Liberty. Warren became increasingly drawn to political activism, and she hosted protest meetings in her home. These meetings laid the foundation for the Committees of correspondence. Warren wrote, &quot;Perhaps no single step contributed so much to cement the union of the colonies, and the final acquisition of independence, as the establishment of committees of correspondence.&quot;

She wrote: &quot;Every domestic enjoyment depends on the unimpaired possession of civil and religious liberty.&quot; Mercy&#x27;s husband James encouraged her to write, fondly referring to her as the &quot;scribbler&quot;, and she became his chief correspondent and sounding board.

==Revolutionary writings and politics==
Warren formed a strong circle of friends with whom she regularly corresponded, including Abigail Adams, John Adams, Martha Washington, and Hannah Winthrop, wife of John Winthrop. In a letter to Catharine Macaulay, she writes: &quot;America stands armed with resolution and virtue; but she still recoils at the idea of drawing the sword against the nation from whom she derived her origin. Yet Britain, like an unnatural parent, is ready to plunge her dagger into the bosom of her affectionate offspring.&quot; 

She became a correspondent and advisor to many political leaders, including Washington, Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, and especially John Adams, who became her literary mentor in the years leading to the Revolution. In a letter to James Warren, Adams writes, &quot;Tell your wife that God Almighty has entrusted her with the Powers for the good of the World, which, in the cause of his Providence, he bestows on few of the human race. That instead of being a fault to use them, it would be criminal to neglect them.&quot;

She had already become acquainted with John Adam&#x27;s cousin, Samuel, as he was a frequent visitor Adams himself had suggested the basic content of the poem, while his request that Warren write was probably due to Warren&#x27;s close friendship with his wife, Abigail. Unsure of how her writing would be received, Warren consulted with her friend Abigail Adams about John Adams&#x27; opinion of her work. John Adams was pleased with the anonymous poem and published it on the front page of the &quot;Boston Gazette&quot;. It was also Adams who had urged her to write a history of the Revolution even while the war was still being fought. For this work, she was able to use her memory of the Revolution, but she solicited copies of congressional debates, letters, and other information from the active participants in the revolution, many of whom she knew personally.

Before and during the Revolution, the Warren home served as a gathering place for patriot debates and meetings, allowing Mercy Warren to meet patriot leaders and their wives. In addition, her husband, James, was on the Massachusetts Committee of Correspondence and among other official positions served as the paymaster of the Continental Army in 1776, a time when Mercy Warren would travel between home and the army to serve as her husband&#x27;s secretary. Her elite and privileged status amid such a dramatically evolving political situation allowed her as a woman entry into the inner circles of revolutionary activity and debate. Not only did she come to know as individuals many of the most important political figures of her times, but she also formed strong opinions about many of them and some like Adams became influential in her literary life. Among those she met was George Washington, whom she described from their first meeting as &quot;one of the most amiable and accomplished gentlemen, both in person, mind, and manners...&quot; Years later, in 1790, she would ask Washington to approve her History, which he did. Another friend, Jefferson helped her get subscriptions for this work. Unfortunately, this same creation also contributed to the bitterness that rose between Warren and John Adams. After the Revolution, Mercy sided with Jeffersonian Republicanism. She openly expressed her opinion in the harshest of terms in her historical account of Adams, ending one of the most productive friendships of the revolutionary period. As with John Adams, John Hancock, who had once wavered about the question of independence from Britain, also fell out of favor with the Warrens. 

Warren wrote several plays, including the satiric &quot;The Adulateur&quot; (1772). Directed against Governor Thomas Hutchinson of Massachusetts, &quot;The Adulateur&quot; foretold the War of Revolution. It was published as a part of a longer play by an unknown author without Warren&#x27;s consent in 1773. One of the main characters in Warren&#x27;s part of the play is &quot;Rapatio&quot;, who represented Hutchinson. Because Warren was a Whig and Hutchinson was a Tory, Warren disagreed with Hutchinson&#x27;s views. Therefore, Rapatio is the antagonist in &quot;The Adulateur.&quot; The protagonist is &quot;Brutus&quot;, whom Warren created to represent her brother, James Otis. In the play, the characters who are Whigs are brave, independent people, while the characters who are Tories are selfish and rude. The play includes a happy ending for the Whigs. After the play was published, Hutchinson become known as Rapatio to citizens of Massachusetts who identified with the Whigs. Because her first play was so successful and she thoroughly enjoyed writing about politics, Warren did not stop there.

In 1773, she wrote &quot;The Defeat&quot;, also featuring a character based on Hutchinson. Hutchinson had no idea of the accuracy of her plot nor completely comprehended the impact she made on his political fate. Warren&#x27;s assistance in the movement to remove Governor Hutchinson from his position through &quot;The Defeat&quot; was one of her greatest accomplishments, and she allowed the piece a rare happy ending. Warren began to doubt as she wrote the third installment in her trilogy&quot;,&quot; feeling the power of her satire compromised her divine purpose to be a &quot;member of the gentler sex,&quot; but she found encouragement from Abigail Adams, who told her, &quot;God Almighty has entrusted [you] with Powers for the good of the World&quot;. With this affirmation, Warren then provided her sharpest political commentary yet: in 1775 Warren published &quot;The Group&quot;, a satire conjecturing what would happen if the British king abrogated the Massachusetts charter of rights. The anonymously published &quot;The Blockheads&quot; (1776) and &quot;The Motley Assembly&quot; (1779) are also attributed to her. In 1788, she published &quot;Observations on the New Constitution&quot;, whose ratification she opposed as an Anti-Federalist.

Warren was one of the most convincing Patriots in the Revolution and her works inspired others to become Patriots. Her work earned the congratulations of numerous prominent men of the age, including George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, who remarked, &quot;In the career of dramatic composition at least, female genius in the United States has outstripped the male&quot;.

==Post-Revolutionary writings and politics==

All of Warren&#x27;s works were published anonymously until 1790 when she published &quot;Poems, Dramatic and Miscellaneous&quot;, the first work bearing her name. The book contains eighteen political poems and two plays. The two plays, called &quot;The Sack of Rome&quot; and &quot;The Ladies of Castille,&quot; deal with liberty as well as social and moral values that were necessary to the success of the new republic.

In 1805, she completed her literary career with a three-volume &quot;History of the Rise, Progress, and Termination of the American Revolution&quot;. President Thomas Jefferson ordered subscriptions for himself and his cabinet and noted his &quot;anticipation of her truthful account of the last thirty years that will furnish a more instructive lesson to mankind than any equal period known in history.&quot; Reflecting her access to Presidents Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, &quot;it is considered one of the few great comprehensive histories of the Revolution and formative years of the Republic written by a contemporary,&quot; according to biographer Martha J. King. The book&#x27;s sharp comments on John Adams led to a heated correspondence and a breach in her friendship with Adams, which lasted until 1812. In response to the book Adams fumed in a letter to a mutual friend &quot;History is not the province of the ladies.&quot;

==Death and legacy==

Warren died on October 19, 1814, at the age of 86, six years after her husband died in 1808. She is buried at Burial Hill, Plymouth, Massachusetts.

Although at first dubious about the proper role of women as propagandists, she succumbed to the urgings of her friends and accepted her duty to use her talents for the patriot cause. Her interest in current events blossomed into the skills of a self-taught historian, with a romanticized style of the sort readers of contemporary literature expected. Like the fiction of the day, her historiography pointed toward moral lessons, and her plays and histories reflected her partisanship against the faction around Governor Hutchinson, or the Hamiltonian Federalists in the national capital. Historians no longer read her for factual details, but they do find her a valuable source on the mood among intellectuals in the Revolutionary era and the early nation. Feminists debate whether she could be considered one of them, for her expressed approach was traditional, with some impatience shown at the restraints. She did strongly encourage women writers while stressing the cheerful performance of household duties.

Warren proved her ability to resonate with her colonial audience, both men and women. She was willing to put forth work calling out the authoritative power while raising a family but was humble and practical in how she presented the commentary through quieter presentations. She told her son George, &quot;The thorns, the thistles, and the briers, in the field of politics seldom permit the soil to produce anything... but ruin to the adventurer&quot;, yet the public would not let her retire from commenting on the political conflicts of her later days.

The SS &quot;Mercy Warren&quot;, a World War II Liberty ship launched in 1943, was named in her honor. In 2002, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York. She is remembered on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail. Her great-great-grandson, Charles Warren, became a distinguished lawyer and historian.

<text>Boulton, Watt and Murdoch is a gilded bronze statue depicting Matthew Boulton, James Watt, and William Murdoch by William Bloye, assisted by Raymond Forbes Kings. It stands on a plinth of Portland stone in Centenary Square, Birmingham and marks the contribution these individuals made to the development of the steam engine and hence the start of the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century.

It is also known as &quot;The Golden Boys&quot; after its colour, or &quot;The Carpet Salesmen&quot; after the partially rolled-up plan of a steam engine which they are examining (and an oblique nod to the often-aggressive marketing that emerged with the rise of industrialisation). 

==History==
In 1939 an £8,000 bequest from Richard Wheatley, and £7,500 from the City Council, enabled the work to be created and it was unveiled in 1956, from preliminary designs drawn up in 1938. In 1956 the statue was erected &quot;temporarily&quot; outside the Birmingham Register Office, with the intention of placing it at a future date in front of a planetarium to be built as part of the Civic Centre, but this never materalised. It therefore remained on the same site for over 60 years. It was restored and re-gilded in September 2006.

In 2017 it was temporarily put into storage to allow construction of the West Midlands Metro. It was reinstalled on the plinth in Centenary Square outside Symphony Hall on 29 April 2022.

<text>Jeane Dixon (January 5, 1904 – January 25, 1997) was one of the best-known American psychics and astrologers of the 20th century, owing to her prediction of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, her syndicated newspaper astrology column, some well-publicized predictions, and a best-selling biography.

==Early life==
Dixon was born Lydia Emma Pinckert, one of 10 siblings born to Richard Franz Pinckert, a native of Gräfenhainichen, Wittenberg,
Saxony-Anhalt, and his wife, Luise Johanne Emma ( Graefe), both Roman Catholics. Dixon was born in Medford, Wisconsin, but raised in Missouri and California. Her birth date was often reported as 1918, and Dixon would proffer this date to reporters, at one point even producing a passport to this effect, but she once testified in a deposition that she was born in 1910. An investigation by a reporter for the &quot;National Observer&quot;, who interviewed family members and examined official records, concluded she was born in 1904.

Dixon claimed that while growing up in California, a &quot;Gypsy&quot; gave her a crystal ball and read her palm, predicting she would become a famous seer and advise powerful people.

==Family==
She was married to James Dixon, a divorcé, from 1939 until his death. The couple had no children. James Dixon was a car dealer in California, who later ran a successful real estate company in Washington, D.C. Dixon worked with her husband in the business for many years and served as the company&#x27;s president.

Dixon was the sister of football player Erny Pinckert.

==Career==
Dixon reportedly predicted the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In the May 13, 1956, issue of &quot;Parade Magazine&quot; she wrote that the 1960 presidential election would be &quot;dominated by labor and won by a Democrat&quot; who would then go on to &quot;be assassinated or die in office though not necessarily in his first term&quot;. In 1960, as the election neared, she changed her mind and incorrectly predicted that Richard Nixon would win. She later admitted she &quot;saw Richard Nixon as the winner&quot; and made unequivocal predictions that he would win. She appeared in the film &quot;The Man Who Saw Tomorrow&quot;, considering the predictions of Nostradamus and discussing her prediction of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination.

Dixon wrote seven books, including her autobiography, a horoscope book for dogs, and an astrological cookbook. She gained public awareness through the biography &quot;A Gift of Prophecy: The Phenomenal Jeane Dixon&quot;, written by syndicated columnist Ruth Montgomery. Published in 1965, the book sold more than 3 million copies. She was a devout Roman Catholic and attributed her prophetic ability to God. Another million-seller, &quot;My Life and Prophecies&quot;, was credited &quot;as told to Rene Noorbergen&quot;, but Dixon was sued by Adele Fletcher, who claimed that her rejected manuscript was rewritten and published as that book. Fletcher was awarded 5% of the royalties by a jury.

In 1967, Dixon was called by Webb and Etoila Hunter in Decatur, Alabama, who were searching for their 34-year-old missing daughter, Mary Faye Hunter. Dixon told the family that Mary Faye was okay; however, Mary Faye was found dead several months after her disappearance. In 1969, she was asked to find Dennis Lloyd Martin, a six-year-old boy who had gone missing in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. She failed to do so.

Richard Nixon followed Dixon&#x27;s writing through his secretary, Rose Mary Woods, and met with Dixon in the Oval Office in 1971. The following year, her prediction of terrorist attacks in the United States in the wake of the Munich massacre spurred Nixon to create a cabinet committee on counterterrorism. She was one of several astrologers who gave advice to Nancy Reagan.

Dixon predicted that before the end of the 20th century, a pope would suffer bodily harm while another would be assassinated. These would purportedly correspond with the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II, and allegations of assassination of Pope John Paul I. She also stated that dissatisfied cardinals would replace a serving pope, which may have referred to John Paul I.

In her 1971 book, &quot;The Call to Glory&quot;, Dixon predicted that an apocalyptic &quot;war of Armageddon&quot; would occur about the year 2020. In her 1969 book &quot;My Life and Prophecies&quot;, she apparently predicted a war between China and Russia would occur between 2025 and 2037, initiated and won by China.

==The Jeane Dixon effect==
John Allen Paulos, a mathematician at Temple University, explored the tendency of Dixon and her fans to promote her few correct predictions while ignoring the larger number of incorrect predictions, naming this habit &quot;the Jeane Dixon effect.&quot;

Many of Dixon&#x27;s predictions proved erroneous, such as her claims that a dispute over the islands of Quemoy and Matsu would trigger the start of World War III in 1958, that American labor leader Walter Reuther would run for president of the United States in the 1964 presidential election, that the second child of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and his wife Margaret would be a girl (they had a boy), and that the Soviets would be the first to put men on the Moon.

In his book &quot;The Mask of Nostradamus&quot;, James Randi also notes that it is a common strategy of prophets to make many predictions, hope that some come true, and subsequently ignore all the incorrect predictions. Randi notes a series of incorrect predictions that Dixon made, also noting that these are only a few from a &quot;&quot;very&quot; long&quot; list. Among these include the predictions that US President Richard Nixon would survive the Watergate scandal and make a comeback, that Russia would be the first country to put a man on the moon, that China would start World War III in 1958, and that the Vietnam War would end in 1966.

==Death==
Dixon suffered cardiac arrest and died at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., on January 25, 1997. Before her death, she uttered the words &quot;I knew this would happen.&quot; Many of her possessions ended up with Leo M. Bernstein, an investor and banker in Washington, D.C., whose clients included Dixon. In 2002, he opened the Jeane Dixon Museum and Library in Strasburg, Virginia. Bernstein died in 2008. In July 2009, the possessions of the museum, 500 boxes in all, were scheduled to be auctioned.

<doc id="342968" wikidata="Q5642705" url="?curid=342968" title="Hall of Memory, Birmingham">
<text>The Hall of Memory is a war memorial in Centenary Square, Birmingham, England, designed by S. N. Cooke and W. N. Twist. Erected 1922–25 by John Barnsley and Son, it commemorates the 12,320 Birmingham citizens who died in World War I.

Built directly over a filled-in canal basin of Gibson&#x27;s Arm, it was the first structure in an area (now occupied by Centenary Square and the International Convention Centre and Symphony Hall) purchased by the council for the creation of a grand civic scheme to include new council offices, the mayor&#x27;s residence, a public library, and a concert hall. The scheme was abandoned after the commencement of World War II with only half of one wing of the planned Baskerville House having been built.
Made from Portland stone, from the Isle of Portland in Dorset, the foundation stone was laid by the Prince of Wales on 12 June 1923 and it was opened by Prince Arthur of Connaught on 4 July 1925 to a crowd of 30,000. Construction had cost £60,000 and was funded through public donations. The four statues around the exterior are by local artist Albert Toft. They represent the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Women&#x27;s Services.

The interior features three carved bas-relief plaques (155 cm x 223 cm) by William Bloye representing three tableaux: &quot;Call&quot; (departure to war), &quot;Front Line&quot; (fighting), &quot;Return&quot; (arrival home of the wounded). These bear inscriptions:
OF 150,000 WHO ANSWERED THE CALL TO ARMS 12,320 FELL: 35,000 CAME HOME DISABLED
AT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN AND IN THE MORNING WE WILL REMEMBER THEM
SEE TO IT THAT THEY SHALL NOT HAVE SUFFERED AND DIED IN VAIN +*+
There is also a roll of honour illustrated by Sidney Meteyard.

The hall was upgraded on 27 October 2014 to a Grade I listed building from its previous Grade II.
During the Birmingham Blitz, on the night of 11 December 1940, all but the fine tower and classical west portico of St Thomas&#x27; Church, Bath Row, was destroyed by German bombs. The church was never rebuilt. The First World War Memorial colonnade, which had been built alongside the Hall of Memory in 1925, was relocated there when Centenary Square was laid out 1989. The gardens were re-designed as the St Thomas&#x27; Peace Garden in 1995 in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the end of World War II, as a monument to peace, and as a memorial to all those killed in armed conflict.

<text>Emilio Giuseppe &quot;Nino&quot; Farina (; 30 October 1906 – 30 June 1966) was an Italian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Farina won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in its inaugural season with Alfa Romeo, and won five Grands Prix across seven seasons.

Born in Turin, Farina was the son of Giovanni Farina, founder of Stabilimenti Farina. Aged nine, he started driving a two-cylinder Temperino, eventually progressing to hillclimbing in 1925. A protégé of Tazio Nuvolari, Farina attracted the attention of Enzo Ferrari in his early career, who signed him to Ferrari in 1936. He immediately impressed, finishing runner-up at the Mille Miglia driving an Alfa Romeo 8C. Farina took his maiden Grand Prix win at the Naples Grand Prix in 1937, winning three consecutive Italian Championships until 1939, the latter two with Alfa Corse. He earned notoriety for his involvement in the fatal accidents of Marcel Lehoux and László Hartmann in 1936 and 1938, respectively. Farina won the Tripoli Grand Prix in 1939, his last victory before World War II.

After the war, Farina returned to Alfa Corse, winning the Nations Grand Prix in 1946. Amongst four major victories in 1948, Farina won the Monaco Grand Prix. He signed for Alfa Romeo in , making his Formula One debut at the series-opening , which he won ahead of Luigi Fagioli. Amidst a title charge by teammate Juan Manuel Fangio, Farina took further wins at the Swiss and Italian Grands Prix, becoming the first World Drivers&#x27; Champion. Although winning the in , Farina was unable to halt the ascent of Fangio and Alberto Ascari. He joined Ascari at Ferrari in , but was unable to hinder his dominance over the next two seasons. Farina took his final victory in Formula One at the in . 

After a string of injuries during , Farina retired from Formula One after Ascari&#x27;s fatal accident in . Amongst five race wins, five pole positions, five fastest laps and 20 podiums, Farina also won 11 non-championship races in Formula One. Aged 49, he returned for the Indianapolis 500 in 1956 with Kurtis Kraft, but was unable to qualify. Farina withdrew from the 1957 Indianapolis 500, after the death of teammate Keith Andrews during practice. In sportscar racing, Farina won the Nürburgring 1000 km, the 24 Hours of Spa and the 12 Hours of Casablanca, all in 1953 with Ferrari and the former two as part of the inaugural World Sportscar Championship. On his way to spectate the 1966 French Grand Prix, Farina died after he lost control of his Lotus Cortina in the French Alps.

== Early years ==

Born in Turin, Farina was the son of Giovanni Carlo Farina (1884–1957) who founded the Stabilimenti Farina coachbuilder. He began driving a two-cylinder Temperino, at the age of just nine. Farina became a Doctor of Political Science (although some sources say engineering); he also excelled at skiing, football and athletics. He cut short a career as a cavalry officer with the Italian army to fulfil a different ambition: motor racing.

While still at university Farina purchased his first car, a second-hand Alfa Romeo, and ran it in the 1925 Aosta-Gran San Bernardo Hillclimb. While trying to beat his father, he crashed, breaking his shoulder and receiving facial cuts, establishing a trend that continued throughout his crash-prone career. His father finished fourth.

During the 1933 and 1934 seasons Farina returned to the sport, racing Maseratis and Alfa Romeos for Gino Rovere and Scuderia Subalpina, and began a friendship with Italian racing legend Tazio Nuvolari. It was Nuvolari who to some extent, guided Farina&#x27;s early career. In 1935, he raced for the factory Maserati team, showing enough promise to impress Enzo Ferrari, who recruited him to drive for Scuderia Ferrari, the team that ran the works-supported Alfa Romeos. It was in an Alfa Romeo 8C that he finished second in the Mille Miglia, after driving through the night without lights. Farina also raced in the U.S., driving for Alfa Romeo in the American Automobile Association-sanctioned Vanderbilt Cups of 1936 and 1937. He became a Grand Prix winner when he won the 1937 Grand Prix of Naples.

Although he was noted for his driving style and intelligence, he had a petulant streak and disregard for his fellow competitors whilst on the race track. He was involved in two fatal accidents. The first was during the 1936 Grand Prix de Deauville, when he tried to pass Marcel Lehoux for second. Farina&#x27;s Alfa Romeo 8C collided with Lehoux&#x27;s ERA, causing the ERA to overturn and catch fire. Lehoux was thrown out, suffered a fractured skull and died in hospital, while Farina escaped with minor injuries. Two seasons later, during the 1938 Gran Premio di Tripoli, László Hartmann&#x27;s Maserati 4CM cut a corner in front of Farina. The cars collided and overturned. Farina survived without major injuries, but Hartmann died the following day.

In 1938, the official Alfa Romeo team, Alfa Corse, returned to motorsport and Farina was a member. Driving the new Alfa Romeo 158 Voiturette in 1939, he won the Grand Prix d&#x27;Anvers, Coppa Ciano and the Prix de Berne, to become the Italian Champion for the third year in succession. The following year, he won the Tripoli Grand Prix and finished second in the Mille Miglia for the third time.

== Post-World War II career ==

After World War II, Farina returned to Alfa Corse to drive their 158. He won the 1946 Grand Prix des Nations. However, he left Alfa Corse after a disagreement over team leadership and sat out the whole of the 1947 season. He came back to the sport in 1948 with a privately entered Maserati and a works Ferrari. During this period, he also married Elsa Giaretto. In her opinion, motorsport was a silly and dangerous activity, and she tried to persuade Farina to stop. Three days after their high society wedding, Farina flew to Argentina where he drove his Maserati 8CL to victory in the Gran Premio Internacional del General San Martín. On his return to Europe, he won the Grand Prix des Nations and the 1948 Monaco Grand Prix. Using Ferrari&#x27;s first Grand Prix car, the Ferrari 125, he won the Circuito di Garda before giving the Temporada another visit. This resulted in victory in the Copa Acción San Lorenzo in February 1949. The rest of the year he raced Maseratis for Scuderia Milano and Scuderia Ambrosiana, and at times in his own 4CLT/48. He won the Lausanne Grand Prix and then was re-signed by Alfa Corse.

=== 1950 World Drivers&#x27; Champion ===

In 1950, Farina returned to Alfa Romeo for the inaugural FIA World Championship of Drivers. The opening race of the season was held at Silverstone Circuit, in front of 150,000 spectators. Farina won, with teammates Luigi Fagioli and Reg Parnell, completing an Alfa Romeo 1–2–3 finish. The victory made Farina the first of only three drivers to win on their World Drivers&#x27; Championship début. The other two are Johnnie Parsons, who won the AAA-sanctioned 1950 Indianapolis 500, 17 days later – and Giancarlo Baghetti, who won the 1961 French Grand Prix.

At Monaco eight days later, a multiple pile-up on the first lap saw Farina spin out of a race that Juan Manuel Fangio went on to win. In the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix, Farina beat his teammate Fagioli into second. The next race, at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, saw Fangio beat Fagioli, with Farina finishing in fourth with transmission problems. At this stage, Farina still led the championship on points: Farina 22; Fagioli 18; Fangio 17.

When Fangio won the 1950 French Grand Prix, Farina finished outside of the points in seventh. By the season finale on 3 September, the 1950 Italian Grand Prix, Farina was trailing his teammate by two points. For Alfa, Monza was home territory and so they fielded an additional car for Piero Taruffi and Consalvo Sanesi. It was the Ferrari of Alberto Ascari who put pressure on the Alfas during the early stages of the race, lying in second, in the knowledge that his car only needed one fuel stop to the Alfas&#x27; two, but he retired with engine problems. Soon after, Fangio&#x27;s gearbox failed and Taruffi handed over his car, only for it to drop a valve and retire. Instead, first position and therefore the championship went to Farina.

He continued with Alfa Romeo for the 1951 season but was beaten by Fangio, who secured the title for the Milanese marque. Farina finished the season in fourth place, with his only world championship victory coming in the 1951 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps. Farina switched back to Ferrari in 1952, when Grand Prix racing switched to Formula 2 specification, but had to take second place to team leader Ascari. He won the non-championship Gran Premio di Napoli and Monza Grand Prix. Ascari&#x27;s total domination of the championship had been a bitter blow to Farina&#x27;s self-image. He also drove Tony Vandervell&#x27;s Thinwall Special – a modified Ferrari 375 F1 car to second place in the end-of-season Woodcote Cup at Goodwood.

He remained at Ferrari for the 1953 season. He was involved in a large accident at the first race of the season, the Argentine Grand Prix: President Juan Perón had allowed free access to the race, which meant that the drivers had to race with hordes of spectators lining the circuit, and a young boy ran across the track while Farina was committed to a fast corner, the Curva Nor Este. Farina was forced to take evasive action and swerved into the spectators standing on the exit of the corner, killing seven and injuring many others.

Farina&#x27;s best result of the season was the victory in the 1953 German Grand Prix. He took up the challenge against the works Maserati of Fangio and Mike Hawthorn when Ascari&#x27;s car lost a wheel. Other non-Championship Formula One victories came in the Gran Premio di Napoli and Grand Prix de Rouen-les-Essarts. By now he had accepted that Ascari and Fangio were faster drivers than him. He nevertheless took a string of podium finishes, gaining third place in the World Championship. This year saw the introduction of the World Sportscar Championship, and as part of the Scuderia Ferrari squad of drivers, Farina made a number of appearances, winning twice. The first came in the 24 Heures de Spa-Francorchamps, when he and Hawthorn had a winning margin of 18 laps, which amounted to about an advantage of close to 90 minutes. The second victory came in the next race, the 1953 1000km of Nürburgring, this time partnered by Ascari, with a smaller margin of just over 15 minutes. He also triumphed in the Daily Express Trophy race at Silverstone in another one-off race in the Thinwall Special.

Although he was now 47, a golden opportunity arose at Ferrari when Ascari left the team, leaving Farina the team leader. After early season results including victories in the 1000 km Buenos Aires sports car race, co-driven by the young Italian Umberto Maglioli, and the Syracuse Grand Prix, he crashed heavily in the Mille Miglia whilst leading in his Ferrari 375 Plus. Just seven weeks later, and with his right arm still in plaster, Farina raced in the 1954 Belgian Grand Prix. He was leading before the end of the first lap, dicing with Fangio&#x27;s Maserati, until the ignition failed on his Ferrari. Later in the season he was badly injured in the Supercortemaggiore Grand Prix, a sports car race at Monza, as a consequence of which he spent 20 days in hospital.

He was back with Ferrari for the start of the 1955 season in Argentina, taking morphine injections to ease the pain. But the heat took its toll on all of the drivers. Farina pitted due to exhaustion, with his Ferrari 625 being taken over by the team&#x27;s spare driver, Maglioli. When José Froilán González pitted, a revived Farina was sent out in his place. Later in the race, González – who was back in his car – crashed but rejoined and handed the car back to Farina, who brought it home in second. Third place in the 1955 Argentine Grand Prix went to Farina&#x27;s original car which had been driven by Maglioli and Maurice Trintignant. After a third place in Belgium, Farina retired mid-season, owing to the continued pain and the death of Ascari. He returned for the 1955 Italian Grand Prix, but his Scuderia Ferrari-entered Lancia D50 suffered a tyre failure at 170 mph during a practice session, whilst on the Monza&#x27;s new banking. The car spun, but Farina stepped out unhurt. Ferrari withdrew the car from the event, and Farina did not start his final Grand Prix.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship Indianapolis 500 career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Farina attempted to qualify for one World Drivers&#x27; Championship race at Indianapolis, failing to make the 1956 race. 

Following abortive entries in 1950 and 1952 where he was set to drive modified grand prix-style cars, Farina entered the 1956 Indianapolis 500 with the &quot;Bardahl-Ferrari&quot; - a Kurtis Kraft chassis with a six-cylinder Ferrari engine installed. This car carried sponsorship from the Seattle-based Bardahl performance lubricants corporation. 

Qualifying for the race took place during four days through May. Farina failed to get up to speed during the first two qualifying sessions. The second weekend of the month saw heavy rain, cancelling the third day of qualifications, and leaving a limited amount of time for drivers to contest the remaining spaces on the grid. On the fourth day of qualifying, Farina was among a number of drivers who were unable to make a final attempt.

Farina elected to race a conventional Offenhauser-powered car in 1957, but he had difficulty getting the car up to speed, experiencing handling issues. His teammate, Keith Andrews, stepped into the car for a test run. Andrews crashed on the front stretch, backing the car into the inside wall and getting crushed to death between the cowl and fuel tank. Following Andrews&#x27; death, Farina withdrew from the event.

== Death ==
Following his retirement, Farina became involved in Alfa Romeo and Jaguar distributorships and later assisted at the Pininfarina factory.

On his way to the 1966 French Grand Prix, Farina lost control of his Lotus Cortina in the Savoy Alps, near Aiguebelle, hit a telegraph pole and was killed instantly. He had been on his way to both watch the race and to take part in filming as the adviser and driving double of the French actor Yves Montand, who played an ex-World Champion in the film &quot;Grand Prix&quot;.

<text>A business process, business method, or business function is a collection of related, structured activities or tasks performed by people or equipment in which a specific sequence produces a service or product (that serves a particular business goal) for a particular customer or customers. Business processes occur at all organizational levels and may or may not be visible to the customers. A business process may often be visualized (modeled) as a flowchart of a sequence of activities with interleaving decision points or as a process matrix of a sequence of activities with relevance rules based on data in the process. The benefits of using business processes include improved customer satisfaction and improved agility for reacting to rapid market change. Process-oriented organizations break down the barriers of structural departments and try to avoid functional silos.

== Overview ==
A business process begins with a mission objective (an external event) and ends with achievement of the business objective of providing a result that provides customer value. Additionally, a process may be divided into subprocesses (process decomposition), the particular inner functions of the process. Business processes may also have a process owner, a responsible party for ensuring the process runs smoothly from start to finish.

Broadly speaking, business processes can be organized into three types, according to von Rosing et al.:

# Operational processes, which constitute the core business and create the primary value stream, e.g., taking orders from customers, opening an account, and manufacturing a component
# Management processes, the processes that oversee operational processes, including corporate governance, budgetary oversight, and employee oversight
# Supporting processes, which support the core operational processes, e.g., accounting, recruitment, call center, technical support, and safety training

There are other definitions of the classification of processes proposed by 

# Strategic processes, which are managerial, directive or steering processes. Management has an important role in each of these. This type of process is related to strategic planning, partnerships, etc.
# Operational processes, which are business processes, are of a productive or &quot;missional&quot; nature. These processes generate a product or service to be delivered to customers. These are considered to be unique or specific to each organisation.
# Support processes, which are auxiliary in nature, support for operational and strategic processes. These are responsible for providing resources and are presented in most organizations.

A business made up of many process may be decomposed into various subprocesses, each of which have their own peculiar aspects but also contribute to achieving the objectives of the business. The business review analyzes processes, that usually include the mapping or modeling of processes and sub-processes down to a group of activities at different levels. Processes can be modeled using a large number of methods and techniques. For instance, the Business Process Modeling Notation is a business process modeling technique that can be used for drawing business processes in a visualized workflow. While decomposing processes into process classifications, categories can be helpful, but care must be taken in doing so as there may be crossover. At last, all processes are part of a largely unified customer-focused result, one of &quot;customer value creation.&quot; This goal is expedited with business process management, which aims to analyze, improve, and enact business processes.

==History==
=== Adam Smith ===
An important early (1776) description of processes was that of economist Adam Smith in his famous example of a pin factory. Inspired by an article in Diderot&#x27;s Encyclopédie, Smith described the production of a pin in the following way:

One man draws out the wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another ... and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them.

Smith also first recognized how output could be increased through the use of labor division. Previously, in a society where production was dominated by handcrafted goods, one man would perform all the activities required during the production process, while Smith described how the work was divided into a set of simple tasks which would be performed by specialized workers. The result of labor division in Smith&#x27;s example resulted in productivity increasing by 24,000 percent (sic), i.e. that the same number of workers made 240 times as many pins as they had been producing before the introduction of labor division.

Smith did not advocate labor division at any price or &quot;&quot;. The appropriate level of task division was defined through experimental design of the production process. In contrast to Smith&#x27;s view which was limited to the same functional domain and comprised activities that are in direct sequence in the manufacturing process, today&#x27;s process concept includes cross-functionality as an important characteristic. Following his ideas, the division of labor was adopted widely, while the integration of tasks into a functional, or cross-functional, process was not considered as an alternative option until much later.

=== Frederick Winslow Taylor ===
American engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor greatly influenced and improved the quality of industrial processes in the early twentieth century. His Principles of Scientific Management focused on standardization of processes, systematic training and clearly defining the roles of management and employees. His methods were widely adopted in the United States, Russia and parts of Europe and led to further developments such as &quot;time and motion study&quot; and visual task optimization techniques, such as Gantt charts.

=== Peter Drucker ===
In the latter part of the twentieth century, management guru Peter Drucker focused much of his work on the simplification and decentralization of processes, which led to the concept of outsourcing. He also coined the concept of the &quot;knowledge worker,&quot; as differentiated from manual workers – and how knowledge management would become part of an entity&#x27;s processes.

=== Other definitions ===
Davenport (1993) defines a (business) process as:

a structured, measured set of activities designed to produce a specific output for a particular customer or market. It implies a strong emphasis on how work is done within an organization, in contrast to a product focus&#x27;s emphasis on what. A process is thus a specific ordering of work activities across time and space, with a beginning and an end, and clearly defined inputs and outputs: a structure for action. ... Taking a process approach implies adopting the customer&#x27;s point of view. Processes are the structure by which an organization does what is necessary to produce value for its customers.

This definition contains certain characteristics that a process must possess. These characteristics are achieved by focusing on the business logic of the process (how work is done) instead of taking a product perspective (what is done). Following Davenport&#x27;s definition of a process, we can conclude that a process must have clearly defined boundaries, input and output, consist of smaller parts and activities which are ordered in time and space, that there must be a receiver of the process outcome—a customer – and that the transformation taking place within the process must add customer value.

Hammer &amp; Champy&#x27;s (1993) definition can be considered as a subset of Davenport&#x27;s. They define a process as:

a collection of activities that takes one or more kinds of input and creates an output that is of value to the customer.

As we can note, Hammer &amp; Champy have a more transformation-oriented perception and put less emphasis on the structural component – process boundaries and the order of activities in time and space.

Rummler &amp; Brache (1995) use a definition that clearly encompasses a focus on the organization&#x27;s external customers, when stating that

a business process is a series of steps designed to produce a product or service. Most processes (...) are cross-functional, spanning the &#x27;white space&#x27; between the boxes on the organization chart. Some processes result in a product or service that is received by an organization&#x27;s external customer. We call these primary processes. Other processes produce products that are invisible to the external customer but essential to the effective management of the business. We call these support processes.
The above definition distinguishes two types of processes, primary and support processes, depending on whether a process is directly involved in the creation of customer value or concerned with the organization&#x27;s internal activities. In this sense, Rummler and Brache&#x27;s definition follows Porter&#x27;s value chain model, which also builds on a division of primary and secondary activities. According to Rummler and Brache, a typical characteristic of a successful process-based organization is the absence of secondary activities in the primary value flow that is created in the customer oriented primary processes. The characteristic of processes as spanning the white space on the organization chart indicates that processes are embedded in some form of organizational structure. Also, a process can be cross-functional, i.e. it ranges over several business functions.

Johansson et al. (1993). define a process as:

a set of linked activities that take an input and transform it to create an output. Ideally, the transformation that occurs in the process should add value to the input and create an output that is more useful and effective to the recipient either upstream or downstream.

This definition also emphasizes the constitution of links between activities and the transformation that takes place within the process. Johansson et al. also include the upstream part of the value chain as a possible recipient of the process output. Summarizing the four definitions above, we can compile the following list of characteristics for a business process:

# &quot;Definability&quot;: It must have clearly defined boundaries, input and output.
# &quot;Order&quot;: It must consist of activities that are ordered according to their position in time and space (a sequence).
# &quot;Customer&quot;: There must be a recipient of the process&#x27; outcome, a customer.
# &quot;Value-adding&quot;: The transformation taking place within the process must add value to the recipient, either upstream or downstream.
# &quot;Embeddedness&quot;: A process cannot exist in itself, it must be embedded in an organizational structure.
# &quot;Cross-functionality&quot;: A process regularly can, but not necessarily must, span several functions.

Frequently, identifying a process owner (i.e., the person responsible for the continuous improvement of the process) is considered as a prerequisite. Sometimes the process owner is the same person who is performing the process.

==Related concepts==

===Workflow===

Workflow is the procedural movement of information, material, and tasks from one participant to another. Workflow includes the procedures, people and tools involved in each step of a business process. A single workflow may either be sequential, with each step contingent upon completion of the previous one, or parallel, with multiple steps occurring simultaneously. Multiple combinations of single workflows may be connected to achieve a resulting overall process.

===Business process re-engineering===

Business process re-engineering (BPR) was originally conceptualized by Hammer and Davenport as a means to improve organizational effectiveness and productivity. It can involve starting from a &quot;blank slate&quot; and completely recreating major business processes, or it can involve comparing the &quot;as-is&quot; process and the &quot;to-be&quot; process and mapping the path for change from one to the other. Often BPR will involve the use of information technology to secure significant performance improvement. The term unfortunately became associated with corporate &quot;downsizing&quot; in the mid-1990s.

===Business process management (BPM)===

Though the term has been used contextually to mixed effect, &quot;business process management&quot; (BPM) can generally be defined as a discipline involving a combination of a wide variety of business activity flows (e.g., business process automation, modeling, and optimization) that strives to support the goals of an enterprise within and beyond multiple boundaries, involving many people, from employees to customers and external partners. A major part of BPM&#x27;s enterprise support involves the continuous evaluation of existing processes and the identification of ways to improve upon it, resulting in a cycle of overall organizational improvement.

===Knowledge management===

Knowledge management is the definition of the knowledge that employees and systems use to perform their functions and maintaining it in a format that can be accessed by others. Duhon and the Gartner Group have defined it as &quot;a discipline that promotes an integrated approach to identifying, capturing, evaluating, retrieving, and sharing all of an enterprise&#x27;s information assets. These assets may include databases, documents, policies, procedures, and previously un-captured expertise and experience in individual workers.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Customer Service&lt;br&gt;
Customer Service is a key component to an effective business business plan. Customer service in the 21st century is always evolving, and it is important to grow with your customer base. Not only does a social media presence matter, but also clear communication, clear expectation setting, speed, and accuracy. If the customer service provided by a business is not effective, it can be detrimental to the business success.

===Total quality management===

Total quality management (TQM) emerged in the early 1980s as organizations sought to improve the quality of their products and services. It was followed by the Six Sigma methodology in the mid-1980s, first introduced by Motorola. Six Sigma consists of statistical methods to improve business processes and thus reduce defects in outputs. The &quot;lean approach&quot; to quality management was introduced by the Toyota Motor Company in the 1990s and focused on customer needs and reducing of wastage. 

Creating a Strong Brand Presence through Social Media&lt;br&gt;

Creating a strong brand presence through social media is an important component to running a successful business. Companies can market, gain consumer insights, and advertise through social media. &quot;According to a Salesforce survey, 85% of consumers conduct research before they make a purchase online, and among the most used channels for research are websites (74%) and social media (38%). Consequently, businesses need to have an effective online strategy to increase brand awareness and grow.&quot; (Paun, 2020)
Customers engage and interact through social media and businesses who are effectively part of social media drive more successful businesses. The most common social media sites that are used for business are Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Businesses with the strongest brand recognition and consumer engagement build social presences on all these platforms.

===Information technology as an enabler for business process management===

Advances in information technology over the years have changed business processes within and between business enterprises. In the 1960s, operating systems had limited functionality, and any workflow management systems that were in use were tailor-made for the specific organization. The 1970s and 1980s saw the development of data-driven approaches as data storage and retrieval technologies improved. Data modeling, rather than process modeling was the starting point for building an information system. Business processes had to adapt to information technology because process modeling was neglected. The shift towards process-oriented management occurred in the 1990s. Enterprise resource planning software with workflow management components such as SAP, Baan, PeopleSoft, Oracle and JD Edwards emerged, as did business process management systems (BPMS) later.

The world of e-business created a need to automate business processes across organizations, which in turn raised the need for standardized protocols and web services composition languages that can be understood across the industry. The Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and Business Motivation Model (BMM) are widely used standards for business modeling. The Business Modeling and Integration Domain Task Force (BMI DTF) is a consortium of vendors and user companies that continues to work together to develop standards and specifications to promote collaboration and integration of people, systems, processes and information within and across enterprises.

The most recent trends in BPM are influenced by the emergence of cloud technology, the prevalence of social media and mobile technology, and the development of analytical techniques. Cloud-based technologies allow companies to purchase resources quickly and as required, independent of their location. Social media, websites and smart phones are the newest channels through which organizations reach and support their customers. The abundance of customer data collected through these channels as well as through call center interactions, emails, voice calls, and customer surveys has led to a huge growth in data analytics which in turn is utilized for performance management and improving the ways in which the company services its customers.

==Importance of the process chain==

Business processes comprise a set of sequential sub-processes or tasks with alternative paths, depending on certain conditions as applicable, performed to achieve a given objective or produce given outputs. Each process has one or more needed inputs. The inputs and outputs may be received from, or sent to other business processes, other organizational units, or internal or external stakeholders.

Business processes are designed to be operated by one or more business functional units, and emphasize the importance of the &quot;process chain&quot; rather than the individual units.

In general, the various tasks of a business process can be performed in one of two ways:

# manually
# by means of business data processing systems such as ERP systems

Typically, some process tasks will be manual, while some will be computer-based, and these tasks may be sequenced in many ways. In other words, the data and information that are being handled through the process may pass through manual or computer tasks in any given order.

==Policies, processes and procedures==

The above improvement areas are equally applicable to policies, processes, detailed procedures (sub-processes/tasks) and work instructions. There is a cascading effect of improvements made at a higher level on those made at a lower level.

For example, if a recommendation to replace a given policy with a better one is made with proper justification and accepted in principle by business process owners, then corresponding changes in the consequent processes and procedures will follow naturally in order to enable implementation of the policies.

==Reporting as an essential base for execution==

Business processes must include up-to-date and accurate reports to ensure effective action. An example of this is the availability of purchase order status reports for supplier delivery follow-up as described in the section on effectiveness above. There are numerous examples of this in every possible business process.

Another example from production is the process of analyzing line ions occurring on the shop floor. This process should include systematic periodical analysis of rejections by reason and present the results in a suitable information report that pinpoints the major reasons and trends in these reasons for management to take corrective actions to control rejections and keep them within acceptable limits. Such a process of analysis and summarisation of line rejection events is clearly superior to a process which merely inquires into each individual rejection as it occurs.

Business process owners and operatives should realise that process improvement often occurs with introduction of appropriate transaction, operational, highlight, exception or M.I.S. reports, provided these are consciously used for day-to-day or periodical decision-making. With this understanding would hopefully come the willingness to invest time and other resources in business process improvement by introduction of useful and relevant reporting systems.

== Supporting theories and concepts ==

=== Span of control ===
The span of control is the number of subordinates a supervisor manages within a structural organization. Introducing a business process concept has a considerable impact on the structural elements of the organization and, thus also on the span of control.

Large organizations that are not organized as markets need to be organized in smaller units, or departments – which can be defined according to different principles.

=== Information management concepts ===
Information management and the organization&#x27;s infrastructure strategies related to it, are a theoretical cornerstone of the business process concept, requiring &quot;a framework for measuring the level of IT support for business processes.&quot;

<text>Crumpsall is an outer suburb and electoral ward of Manchester, in Greater Manchester, England, north of Manchester city centre, bordered by Cheetham Hill, Blackley, Harpurhey, Broughton, and Prestwich. The population at the 2011 census was 15,959. Historically part of Lancashire, Crumpsall was a township within the parish of Manchester, Salford hundred. North Manchester General Hospital is in Crumpsall.

==History==
The name Crumpsall derives from old English and means a &quot;crooked piece of land beside a river&quot;. It is first mentioned in 1291. In 1472, Crumpsall was held in socage by James Radcliffe subject to an annual rent of ten shillings. It later passed to the family of Edward Coke who held it until 1789 when it was divided. One part was sold to Thomas Egerton, 1st Earl of Wilton and another, 188 acres, to William Marsden of Liverpool. Marsden&#x27;s portion was divided into three farms: Boardman&#x27;s Tenement, Pendleton Tenement and Oldham&#x27;s Tenement and a dyeworks known as Holland&#x27;s Tenement. Oldham&#x27;s Tenement, 45 acres, was sold to the Guardians of the Poor of Manchester in 1855 as a site for the new workhouse, later known as Springfield Hospital. Pendleton Tenement was bought by the Delaunay family and later sold to the Prestwich Poor law union as the site for a workhouse.

Crumpsall was rural in character during the early part of the 19th century, however, the necessity to house Manchester&#x27;s growing population of mill workers saw the area become more urbanised. Crumpsall was incorporated into the city of Manchester in 1890.

Crumpsall Hall was the seat of the Chethams and subsequently passed to the Waklyns. The Manchester workhouse was built after the formation of the Poor Law Unions in 1837.

The Co-operative Wholesale Society opened the Crumpsall Biscuit Works in Lower Crumpsall around 1873.

Crumpsall is the location of North Manchester General Hospital. This was previously three hospitals: Crumpsall Hospital (a general hospital), Springfield Hospital (a psychiatric hospital) and Delaunay&#x27;s Hospital (a geriatric hospital).

In January 2003 Detective Constable Stephen Oake, a Greater Manchester Police officer, was fatally stabbed whilst arresting a suspected terrorist in a house on Crumpsall Lane.

==Governance==

Crumpsall was formerly a township in the parish of Manchester, in the Salford hundred in the historic county of Lancashire. It was part of the Manchester Poor Law Union (PLU) between 1841 and 1850, the Prestwich PLU from 1850 to 1915, and again in the Manchester PLU from 1915 to 1930. In 1854 a Local Board of Health was established for the area of the township. In 1866 Crumpsall became a separate civil parish, in 1890 it was incorporated into County Borough of Manchester, on 26 March 1896 the parish was abolished to form North Manchester. In 1891 the parish had a population of 10,371.

<doc id="342982" wikidata="Q2419717" url="?curid=342982" title="Raymond Mason (sculptor)">
<text>Raymond Grieg Mason (2 March 1922, in Birmingham, England – 13 February 2010 in Paris, France) was a sculptor.

He trained at the Birmingham School of Arts and Crafts under William Bloye, the Royal College of Art (for one term), and Slade School of Art. He lived and worked in Paris beginning in 1946. He was a close friend of the late Nobel Prize–winning scientist Maurice Wilkins.He is known for his sculptures of tightly packed people made from clay, with works on McGill College Avenue in Montreal; the Tuileries, Paris; Georgetown, Washington, D.C.; and Madison Avenue, New York. His controversial 1991 fibre-glass work, &quot;Forward&quot; in Birmingham&#x27;s Centenary Square was destroyed by arson on 17 April 2003. The statue carried a reference to DNA (&quot;the secret of life&quot;) in connection with Maurice Wilkins, who went to school in Birmingham and worked at the University of Birmingham.

He was the subject of an episode of the BBC television series &quot;Omnibus&quot;, &quot;The Return of Raymond Mason,&quot; broadcast on 28 November 1982, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for &quot;services to sculpture and to Anglo-French relations&quot; in the 2002 New Year Honours.

The sculptor Ron Mueck commented on his death: &quot;I cannot remember there not being a Raymond Mason book on my shelf... The strong pulse of Life in his work always impressed me greatly. When I look at Mason&#x27;s work it feels like seeing clearly through someone else&#x27;s eyes. That can be an unsettling experience, but rewarding when it is a vibrant, unique vision of the world.&quot;

<doc id="342989" wikidata="Q28511" url="?curid=342989" title="Buyeo">
<text>Buyeo (; ; ), also rendered as Puyŏ or Fuyu, was an ancient kingdom that was centered in northern Manchuria in modern-day northeast China. It had ties to the Yemaek people, who are considered to be the ancestors of modern Koreans. Buyeo is considered a major predecessor of the Korean kingdoms of Goguryeo and Baekje.

According to the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;, Buyeo was initially placed under the jurisdiction of the Xuantu Commandery, one of Four Commanderies of Han in the later Western Han. Buyeo entered into formal diplomatic relations with the Eastern Han dynasty by the mid-1st century AD as an important ally of that empire to check the Xianbei and Goguryeo threats. Jurisdiction of Buyeo was then placed under the Liaodong Commandery of the Eastern Han. After an incapacitating Xianbei invasion in 285, Buyeo was restored with help from the Jin dynasty. This, however, marked the beginning of a period of decline. A second Xianbei invasion in 346 finally destroyed the state excepting remnants in its core region; these survived as vassals of Goguryeo until their final annexation in 494.

Inhabitants of Buyeo included the Yemaek tribe. There are no scholarly consensus on the classification of the languages spoken by the Puyo, with theories including Japonic, Amuric and a separate branch of macro-Tungusic. According to the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the Buyeo language was similar to those of Goguryeo and Ye, and the language of Okjeo was only slightly different from them. Both Goguryeo and Baekje, two of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, considered themselves Buyeo&#x27;s successors.

==Mythical origins==
The mythical founder of the Buyeo kingdom was Hae Mo-su, the Dongmyeong of Buyeo which literally means &quot;Holy King of Buyeo.&quot; After its foundation, the son of heaven (Hae Mo-su ) brought the royal court to his new palace, and he was proclaimed to be King.

Jumong, the founder of Goguryeo, is described as the son of Hae Mo-su and Lady Yuhwa () who was the daughter of Habaek (), the god of the Amnok River or, according to an alternative interpretation, the sun god Haebak ().

==History==
===Archaeological predecessors===
The Buyeo state emerged from the Bronze Age polities of the Xituanshan and Liangquan archaeological cultures in the context of trade with various Chinese polities. In particular was the state of Yan which introduced iron technology to Manchuria and the Korean peninsula after its conquest of Liaodong in the early third century BC.

===Relations with Chinese dynasties===

In the later Western Han (202 BC – 9 AD), Buyeo established close ties with the Xuantu Commandery, one of Four Commanderies of Han according to the Book of the Later Han volume 85 Treatise on the Dongyi, although it proceeded to becoming a nominal tributary-state and practical ally of Eastern Han in 49 AD. This was advantageous to the Han as an ally in the northeast would curb the threats of the Xianbei in western Manchuria and eastern Mongolia and Goguryeo in the Liaodong region and the northern Korean peninsula. The Buyeo elites also sought this arrangement as it legitimized their rule and gave them better access to Han&#x27;s prestige trade goods.

During a period of turmoil in China&#x27;s northeast, Buyeo attacked some of Eastern Han&#x27;s holdings in 111, but relations were mended in 120 and thus a military alliance was arranged. Two years later, Buyeo sent troops to the Xuantu commandery to prevent it from being destroyed by Goguryeo when it sent reinforcement to break the siege of the commandery seat. In AD 167, Buyeo attacked the Xuantu commandery but was defeated. When Emperor Xian (AD 189 – AD 220) ruled Eastern Han, Buyeo was reclassified as a tributary of the Liaodong Commandery of Han.

In the early 3rd century, Gongsun Du, a Chinese warlord in Liaodong, supported Buyeo to counter Xianbei in the north and Goguryeo in the east. After destroying the Gongsun family, the northern Chinese state of Cao Wei sent Guanqiu Jian to attack Goguryeo. Part of the expeditionary force led by Wang Qi (), the Grand Administrator of the Xuantu Commandery, pursued the Guguryeo court eastward through Okjeo and into the lands of the Yilou. On their return journey they were welcomed as they passed through the land of Buyeo. It brought detailed information of the kingdom to China.

In 285 the Murong tribe of the Xianbei, led by Murong Hui, invaded Buyeo, pushing King Uiryeo (依慮) to suicide, and forcing the relocation of the court to Okjeo. Considering its friendly relationship with the Jin Dynasty, Emperor Wu helped King Uira (依羅) revive Buyeo. According to accounts in the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; and the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, the Murong attacked the Buyeo and forced the Buyeo to relocate several times in the 4th century.

Goguryeo&#x27;s attack sometime before 347 caused further decline. Having lost its stronghold on the Ashi River (within modern Harbin), Buyeo moved southwestward to Nong&#x27;an. Around 347, Buyeo was attacked by Murong Huang of the Former Yan, and King Hyeon (玄) was captured. Originally, the Murong Xianbei created the Yan states, with five states emerging during the Sixteen Kingdoms period, and thus were able to do so. 

===Fall===
According to &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, in 504, the tribute emissary Yesilbu mentions that the gold of Buyeo could no longer be obtainable for tribute as Buyeo had been driven out by the Malgal and the Somna and absorbed into Baekje. It is also shown that the Emperor Xuanwu of Northern Wei wished that Buyeo would regain its former glory.

A remnant of Buyeo seems to have lingered around modern Harbin area under the influence of Goguryeo. Buyeo paid tribute once to Northern Wei in 457–8, but otherwise seems to have been controlled by Goguryeo. In 494, Buyeo was under attack by the rising Wuji (also known as the Mohe, ), and the Buyeo court moved and surrendered to Goguryeo.

===Jolbon Buyeo===
Many ancient historical records indicate the &quot;Jolbon Buyeo&quot; (), apparently referring to the incipient Goguryeo or its capital city. In 37 BC, Jumong became the first king of Goguryeo. Jumong went on to conquer Okjeo, Dongye, and Haengin, regaining some of Buyeo and former territory of Gojoseon.

==Culture==
According to Chapter 30 &quot;Description of the Eastern Archerians, Dongyi&quot; in the Chinese &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (3rd century), the Buyeo were agricultural people who occupied the northeastern lands in Manchuria (North-East China) beyond the great walls. The aristocratic rulers subject to the king bore the title &quot;ka&quot; (加) and were distinguished from each other by animal names, such as the dog &quot;ka&quot; and horse &quot;ka&quot;.Four &quot;ka&quot;s existed in Buyeo, which were horse &quot;ka&quot;, cow &quot;ka&quot;, pig &quot;ka&quot;, and dog &quot;ka&quot;, and &quot;ka&quot; is presumed to be of similar origin with the title &quot;khan&quot;. The &quot;ka&quot; system was similarly adopted in Goguryeo.

The same text states that the Buyeo language was similar to those of its southern neighbours Goguryeo and Ye, and that the language of Okjeo was only slightly different from them.
Based on this account, Lee Ki-Moon grouped the four languages as the Puyŏ languages, contemporaneous with the Han languages of the Samhan confederacies in southern Korea. 

The earliest mentions of the Korean practice of wearing Minbok are also from this source. The text reads:

==Law==
Buyeo had a law that makes the thief reimburse the price that is equivalent to twelve times of the original amount the person stole, and had an eye to eye approach in terms of law.

==Legacy==
In the 1930s, Chinese historian Jin Yufu (金毓黻) developed a linear model of descent for the people of Manchuria and northern Korea, from the kingdoms of Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Baekje, to the modern Korean nationality. Later historians of Northeast China built upon this influential model.

Goguryeo and Baekje, two of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, considered themselves successors of Buyeo. King Onjo, the founder of Baekje, is said to have been a son of King Dongmyeong, founder of Goguryeo. Baekje officially changed its name to Nambuyeo (South Buyeo, ) in 538. Goryeo also considered itself a descendant of Buyeo through their direct ancestral ties with Goguryeo and Baekje. This is seen in their representation of palace names that were named after former kingdoms that were considered their forefathers.

<text>John Paul Herbert (born 25 June 1964) is a British former racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to . Herbert won three Formula One Grands Prix across 12 seasons. In endurance racing, Herbert won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Mazda, as well as the 12 Hours of Sebring in 2002 with Audi.

Herbert competed in Formula One for Benetton, Tyrrell, Lotus, Ligier, Sauber, Stewart and Jaguar. He finished fourth in the 1995 World Championship with Benetton. Upon his retirement from motor racing, Herbert became a pundit for Sky Sports F1 from 2012 until 2022.

==Career==

===Early career and entry to Formula One===

Winning the Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch in 1985, Herbert caught Eddie Jordan&#x27;s attention, and together they won the 1987 British Formula 3 title. Herbert suffered career-threatening injuries in 1988, as a then championship hopeful in International Formula 3000 when he was caught up in a major accident at Brands Hatch, when Gregor Foitek nudged the side of his vehicle at Pilgrim&#x27;s Drop, causing Herbert to slam into the wall head-on, then bounce across the track and slam head on again into the opposite barrier, sustaining severe ankle and foot injuries after yet more multiple collisions with the barriers. The threat of amputation loomed but it eventually passed after multiple surgeries and months of physiotherapy, though the extent of Herbert&#x27;s injuries would permanently hinder his mobility, leaving him unable to run and forcing him to change his driving style.

Despite his immobility, Herbert returned to racing at the beginning of 1989 in Formula 1, scoring points on his debut at the Brazilian Grand Prix in Rio de Janeiro driving for the Benetton team, then managed by his long-time mentor and friend Peter Collins. Herbert finished 4th in Brazil, only 10.5 seconds behind the race winning Ferrari of Nigel Mansell and only 1.1 seconds behind the 3rd placed March-Judd of Maurício Gugelmin and only 2.6 seconds behind the 2nd placed McLaren-Honda of then double World Champion Alain Prost. Herbert&#x27;s teammate, the highly rated Italian Alessandro Nannini, finished in 6th place, 7.7 seconds behind Herbert.

However, Herbert&#x27;s performances could not keep up to that standard (he reportedly found it hard to press the brake pedal, which adversely affected his lap times), and with the Benetton team under new management he was dropped after failing to qualify for the Canadian Grand Prix (after having finished 5th in the previous round in Phoenix) and was replaced by McLaren&#x27;s test driver Emanuele Pirro. Herbert returned to Formula 3000, this time in the highly regarded Japanese series. It was not long before he received another call from Formula One, this time with Tyrrell. From 1990 to 2000, Herbert was a fixture in Formula One, switching to the dwindling Lotus team, now managed by Peter Collins. His first race for the Norfolk-based team came at the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix after Martin Donnelly suffered a career-ending crash in Jerez.

In 1991, he returned to the team at the Canadian Grand Prix following the departure of Julian Bailey. He had to relinquish his seat to Michael Bartels while Grands Prix clashed with Japanese F3000 meetings. His first points finish in almost three years came at the 1992 South African Grand Prix when he drove his two-year old Lotus chassis to sixth place. He repeated this result in France, by which time Lotus had introduced the more competitive 107. Poor reliability and bad luck cost him the chance to add to his points tally but Herbert showed well against his highly rated teammate, future-World Champion Mika Häkkinen. In the 24 races the two drove alongside each other at Lotus, Herbert outqualified the Finn 14 times. 1993 was his most successful season with Lotus, finishing in fourth place three times. But 1994 was a disaster as the team was blighted by financial woes. He utilised an upgraded Mugen Honda introduced for the Italian Grand Prix to qualify a magnificent fourth but hopes of a strong finish were quashed when he was involved in a multi-car collision at the first corner. Lotus&#x27; lack of resources meant he had to use the spare car with the old-spec Mugen engine, which didn&#x27;t last long before it expired. His final race for Lotus came at the Portuguese Grand Prix.
During 1991, he also drove two rounds of the Fuji Long Distance Sports Car Series, co-driving a Mazda 787B, finishing fourth both times. His decision at the July round to stop his car and aid a fellow competitor who had suffered a puncture at high speed would earn him the Sportsman Award at the 1991 Autosport Awards.

===Ligier and return to Benetton (1994–1995)===

After three years of frustration, Herbert had his Lotus contract bought out by Tom Walkinshaw in late 1994, joining Ligier and then Benetton for the last few races of the season. Although he failed to score any points in 1994, he was retained as Michael Schumacher&#x27;s teammate for 1995. As Benetton&#x27;s number-two driver he found life at the team difficult with the B195 specifically designed around Schumacher&#x27;s driving style. The World Champion also forbade Herbert from viewing his telemetry. He achieved his first podium finish with a second place in Spain as Benetton scored their first one-two finish since 1990. He then took his first victory at the British Grand Prix after Damon Hill and Michael Schumacher collided. Prior to the race rumours were abound that he was about to be dropped in favour of test-driver Jos Verstappen. He followed this with a win in similar circumstances at Monza and finished 4th in the championship.

===Sauber, Stewart and Jaguar (1996–2000)===

After being dropped by Benetton, Herbert drove for Swiss team Sauber in 1996–1998, scoring two podium places, the first of the two being in the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix, which were his only points of that season, and the other being in the 1997 Hungarian Grand Prix. That year would be Herbert&#x27;s most successful at Sauber, scoring several times. Moving to Stewart Grand Prix in 1999, he was routinely outqualified by his younger teammate Rubens Barrichello but scored his third and final Grand Prix win in the rain-affected European Grand Prix. At the Malaysian Grand Prix he finished fourth in a race which he would later describe as his strongest performance since his pre-accident days. Staying at Stewart after the team was purchased by Ford and became Jaguar, Herbert endured another frustrating and pointless season, ending the year being stretchered off at Malaysia after a suspension failure caused him to crash heavily.

===After Formula One===
In 2001 he was employed by Arrows F1 team owner Tom Walkinshaw, to act as the team developmental/test driver.

On Monday, August 13, 2001, the day after the Indy Racing League’s Belterra Resort Indy 300 at Kentucky Speedway, he tested the Dallara purchased by Mecom Racing Team from Target Chip Ganassi Racing and driven by Tony Stewart at the 2001 Indianapolis 500, with the car being set up by Jeff Ward, recording a fastest lap time that would have split the front row for the race.

Since retiring from Formula One racing, Herbert has concentrated on sports car racing, trying to repeat his Le Mans 24 Hours overall win of 1991. Recent years have seen him as one of the front runners in the American Le Mans Series (ALMS), where he won several events and was a challenger for the 2003 crown.

In 2004, Herbert, along with Jamie Davies won the Le Mans Series championship at the wheel of an Audi R8 winning the races at Monza and Spa along the way.

In 2005, Herbert was appointed to the post of Sporting Relations Manager at Jordan Grand Prix, which was then renamed Midland F1 for the 2006 World Championship. However, in September of that year Spyker Cars bought the team, and renamed it Spyker MF1. One of the new owners&#x27; decisions was to not renew Herbert&#x27;s contract.

In 2007, Herbert entered the Le Mans 24 Hours driving for the factory Aston Martin team at the wheel of the Aston Martin DBR9 in the GT1 class. Herbert, along with Peter Kox and Tomáš Enge drove the 007 numbered car to a 9th placed overall finish and 4th in the GT1 class.

In 2008, Herbert won the first season of the Speedcar Series.

In 2009, Herbert made his debut in the British Touring Car Championship for Team Dynamics at the wheel of a Honda Civic at round eight of the championship, Silverstone. He qualified 17th for the first race, and after moving up the order, finished in 13th. In the second race, he finished inside the points in eighth place, scoring three points. In the final race of the day, a reverse starting grid is operated. The first six, seven, eight, nine or ten cars to finish race two, start race three in reverse order. This is decided by the winner of race two drawing a number between six and ten out of a hat. For the final race of the day, the top 9 finishers were reversed, meaning Herbert started from second. He was running well, and was holding 4th, but was forced to retire on lap 13, after contact with Jason Plato. Herbert went on to compete in the final two rounds of the season.

Herbert also runs a charity event called the Johnny Herbert Karting Challenge every year for charities like the halow project which is now held at Capital Karts in London. This event invites celebrities and professional racing drivers to compete in indoor go karting and is now in its 20th year.

===Sky Sports F1===

From 2012 to 2022, Herbert was a regular contributor to the Sky Sports F1 channel. He was an occasional presence as one of the insiders in &quot;Sky Race Control&quot; during practices, qualifying sessions, and races alongside Anthony Davidson, Damon Hill, Nico Rosberg, and Paul Di Resta.

===GT Academy===
In 2013 and 2014, Herbert mentored six contestants in a primetime ITV4 reality series, with the aim of taking players of the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; videogames to the Dubai 24 Hour race as real drivers. Other countries in Europe had heats mentored by drivers Vitantonio Liuzzi and Sébastien Buemi.

<text>Bishop Auckland ( ) is a market town and civil parish at the confluence of the River Wear and the River Gaunless in County Durham, England. It is northwest of Darlington and southwest of Durham.

Much of the town&#x27;s early history surrounds the Bishops of Durham and the establishment of Auckland Castle&#x27;s predecessor, a hunting lodge, which became the main residence of Durham Bishops. This is reflected in the first part of the town&#x27;s name. During the Industrial Revolution, the town grew rapidly as coal mining became its largest industry. Decline in the coal mining industry during the late twentieth century has changed the town&#x27;s largest sector to manufacturing.

Since 1 April 2009, the town&#x27;s local authority has been Durham County Council. The unitary authority replaced the previous Wear Valley District and Durham County councils. The parliamentary constituency of Bishop Auckland is named after the town. It is currently held by Sam Rushworth of the Labour Party. The town is twinned with the French town of Ivry-sur-Seine.

==History==
===Names===
The town was first attested under the name &quot;Alclit&quot; with &quot;Alcluith&quot; and &quot;Alcleat&quot; also found. &quot;Auckland&quot; is an area name used in the settlements of St Helen Auckland, West Auckland and St Andrew Auckland, the latter an old name for South Church, all of which are along the path of the Gaunless. The town was in the Bishop of Durham&#x27;s land, gaining the &#x27;bishop&#x27; element to differentiate it from the other settlements.

The name Gaunless is of Norse origin, thought to meaning &quot;useless&quot;. It is believed that this derives from the river&#x27;s inability to power a mill, sustain fish or create fertile floodplains.

====Auckland====
It is thought to be Cumbric, related to &quot;Alclud&quot; (which was the Kingdom of Strathclyde&#x27;s alternative name) meaning &quot;cliff on the Clyde&quot;. It is thought &#x27;Clyde&#x27; may be the river Gaunless&#x27;s ancient name.

Historically attempts have been made to link Auckland to Old Norse &quot;Aukland&quot; meaning &#x27;additional land&#x27;. This view of the name origin could refer to the area recorded as being extra land granted to the Bishop of Durham by King Canute in around 1020.

Another suggestion is that Auckland derives from Old English or Old Norse combination of &#x27;oak&#x27; and &#x27;land&#x27;, a woodland in the area with a majority of oak trees with each settlement built between it and the river Gaunless.

===Early===

The earliest known reference to Bishop Auckland itself is around 1000 AD as land given to the Earl of Northumberland for defending the church against the Scots. It is also mentioned in 1020 as a gift given to the Bishop of Durham by King Canute. However, a village almost certainly existed on the town&#x27;s present site long before this, with there being evidence of church on the site of St Andrew&#x27;s Church in South Church as early as the seventh century. Furthermore, the Romans had a look-out post where Auckland Castle is sited today and a fort at nearby Binchester. There is also evidence of possible Iron Age settlements around the town, together with finds of Bronze Age, Neolithic and Mesolithic artefacts.

=== Bishops of Durham ===

Much of the town&#x27;s history surrounds its links with the Bishops of Durham. In 1083, Bishop William de St-Calais expelled a number of canons from Durham. Some of these settled in the area and established a collegiate church. Around 1183 Bishop Pudsey established a manor house in the town, with a great hall being completed in 1195 on the site occupied by St Peter&#x27;s Chapel today. Bishop Bek, who preferred the town as his main residence over Durham Castle due to its proximity to hunting grounds, later converted the manor house into a castle. The grounds of the castle were noted as being large enough to contain 16,000 men ahead of the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross in 1346.

Between 1283 and 1310, Bek was also responsible for ordering the replacement of the collegiate church established in 1183 with the Church of St Andrew that stands in South Church today, together with accommodation for the canons; the building known today as the East Deanery.

The collegiate church also appears to have supported a school. The collegiate church was re-organised under Bishop Langley in 1428 and at some point in the same century moved to the castle grounds. The college and its school were finally dissolved in the 16th century.

The school was not revived until the reign of King James I when in 1604 Anne Swifte petitioned the King to found a school and the Free Grammar School of King James, the direct antecedent of today&#x27;s King James I school, was established. Although the school&#x27;s early location is unknown, in 1638 Bishop Morton granted the school space in an old chapel in the Market Place.

Also in 1604, James&#x27;s son, the future King Charles I made the first of three visits to the town. On this visit, his first to England, he was entertained by Bishop Matthew. In 1617 James himself stayed in Auckland Castle between 17 and 19 April. Later, on 8 May, at Durham Castle King James is reputed to have rebuked Bishop William James so badly that the Bishop returned to Auckland Castle and died three days later.

Charles&#x27;s second visit to the town was on his way to Scotland on 31 May 1633, when he was entertained by Bishop Morton. His third visit on 4 February 1647 was in less lavish circumstances, as a prisoner. Morton had fled the town in 1640 and the castle was empty. Consequently, the king had to stay in a public house off the Market Place owned by Christopher Dobson.
After the disestablishment of the Church of England, at the end of the first civil war, Auckland Castle was sold to Sir Arthur Hazelrig, who demolished much of the castle, including the chapel, and built a mansion. After the restoration of the monarchy, the new bishop of Durham, John Cosin, in turn demolished Hazelrig&#x27;s mansion and rebuilt the castle converting the banqueting hall into the chapel that stands today.

The Bishop of Durham as of early November 2019, was the Rt Rev. Paul Roger Butler whose position allows him to hold a seat in the House of Lords.

In 2012, Jonathan Ruffer purchased Auckland Castle and all of the contents, including the artwork, which included the works by Francisco de Zurbarán. The castle was scheduled to re-open to visitors in November 2019, after a multi-million pound restoration project. The site would also include three new restaurants for visitors, with one in operation by early November 2019. Nonetheless, the Scotland Wing houses the offices of the Bishop of Durham.

=== Industrial Revolution ===
By 1801, the town had a population of 1861. At the end of the eighteenth century the town had no notable roads other than the Roman road, and little trade beyond weaving. Although, coal mining had existed on a small-scale as early as 1183 when it is mentioned in the Boldon Book, it was limited by the lack of an easy way to transport coal away from the area. All this changed with the arrival of railways in the early nineteenth century, which allowed large scale coal mining. The railways allowed coal to be mined, and then transported to the coast before being put onto ships to London and even abroad.

Around the same time, the bishop, Shute Barrington was a keen proponent of the use of education to improve the social and moral circumstances of the lower social classes. He used £70,000 received from lead mining royalties in Weardale to fund the establishment of a number of schools in the area. One of these schools was the Bishop Barrington School (now Bishop Barrington Academy), one of the town&#x27;s three comprehensive schools today. The Bishop Barrington School opened on 26 May 1810, the Bishop&#x27;s own birthday. The school even allowed girls to attend until the age of 11 years. Barrington&#x27;s support of education for the poor was not without controversy. Some suggested education of the poor would lead people to question their position in society, others even blamed it for the French Revolution.

Barrington&#x27;s successor, William van Mildert was involved in the creation of Durham University. Durham Castle was donated to the new university and Auckland Castle, usually the preferred residence by successive Bishops, became the Bishop of Durham&#x27;s official residence in 1832. However, the influence of the bishops of Durham was on the wane and there was pressure for reform. Van Mildert would be the last ruler of the county palatine. Shortly after his death, in 1836, the position was stripped of its ancient powers and wealth.

By 1851 the population of the town had more than doubled to 5,112, with a great proportion of them working in ironworks and collieries. By 1891, the population had doubled again. In the second half of the nineteenth century there were typically around 60 collieries in the area open at any one time. By the turn of the twentieth century 16,000 people were employed in the mining industry in the area.

The town also became an important centre for rail, with large amounts of minerals such as coal, limestone and ironstone mined in the surrounding area passing through the town on the way to the coast. In the neighbouring town of Shildon large numbers were employed in the railways, where a railway engine works was established.

===Industrial decline===

By the early years of the twentieth century coal mining started to go into decline as coal reserves started to become exhausted. By the end of the 1920s unemployment had hit 27% and the population too had started to decline, as colliery employment had halved compared with ten years previously. With the onset of the Great Depression unemployment rose to 60% in 1932 before easing back to 36% in 1937. The Second World War offered a temporary reprieve for the coal industry, however, after the war the decline continued. The last deep colliery in the area closed in 1968, although drift mines and the much more mechanised and less labour-intensive surface level opencast mining did continue.

Equally, the railways that had also supported the area were also scaled back, ultimately culminating in the closure of Shildon&#x27;s Wagon works in 1984 with the loss of thousands of jobs.

A 2016 report on the community stated that

the rate of unemployment in Bishop Auckland is both higher than the average for and higher than the national average... The rate of claiming any benefit (which includes in work benefits) is more than 25% higher in Bishop Auckland than the national average, suggesting that many people maybe under employed or on a low salary.
==Economy==

At the end of the eighteenth century the town is noted as having little trade beyond weaving. The first mention of coal mining in the area is in the Boldon Book of 1183, but early coal mining was limited by the lack of an easy way to transport coal away from the area. The arrival of the railways transformed the town as it allowed coal to be mined, and then transported to the coast before being put onto ships to London and even abroad. At the start of the twentieth century 16,000 people were employed in the mining industry in the area. However, by 1915 the coal industry in the town had started to decline as coal reserves started to become exhausted. The last deep colliery in the area closed in 1968.

Today, with the decline of the Durham coalfield, manufacturing has been left as the largest sector of employment in the town, accounting for 24.6% of the town&#x27;s employment.

The town also traditionally had a strong retail sector. As one of the county&#x27;s main population centres with good bus and rail connections, and thriving markets on Thursdays and Saturdays, shoppers were attracted from smaller settlements on the Durham coalfield for miles around. However, the decline in the coal mining industry, along with increased car ownership and competition from local shopping malls such as the MetroCentre in Gateshead, have caused a downturn in the fortunes of retailers, with commentators lamenting the number of down market stores and charity shops in the town centre. In response, numerous initiatives to regenerate the town centre have been proposed, including the launch of the Bishop Auckland Town Centre Forum, and the 2006 regeneration master plan drawn up by Red Box Group, which was sponsored by Wear Valley District Council and the regional development agency One NorthEast. In 2015, Bishop Auckland was granted Heritage Action Zone status by Historic England, a 5-year programme that aimed to reinvigorate the town and its economy through tourism and its heritage.

Notable employers in the town include Ebac, which is headquartered in the town and employs 350 people.

A September 2019 report stated that Bishop Auckland was one of the towns designated to receive up £25 million to in funding from a new Towns Fund that was intended &quot;to improve industrial areas that have not benefitted from economic growth in the same way as more prosperous areas.&quot; A Durham County Councillor said that the funds would help the partners (including the Auckland Project) to regenerate the town center area for the benefit of all residents of the community.

===Building tourism in the town===

An October 2019 article in The Guardian referred to Bishop Auckland as a &quot;rundown town ... since the closure of the mines&quot; but predicted that the re-opening of Auckland Castle would transform the community into a &quot;leading tourist destination&quot;. The castle re-opened on 2 November 2019 after renovations by the Auckland Project; the founding partner of the group is the owner of the castle, Jonathan Ruffer who purchased the property and all of the contents in 2012, including the artwork, which included the works by Francisco de Zurbarán.
News reports in 2019 clarified the situation, stating that in 2012, Ruffer had purchased the castle and all of the contents, including the artwork, which included the works by Francisco de Zurbarán. The paintings which had been on tour, were returned to the site in time for the re-opening of the castle to visitors on 2 November 2019 as the Auckland Project, after a multi-million pound restoration project, funded partly by the National Lottery.

By the time of the opening day, a new 35 meter high tower had been erected as a visitor centre; the structure has a lift and a staircase as well as balconies for views of the castle from above. The interior had been fully restored, including the 
bishops&#x27; &quot;palatial&quot; quarters. According to one news item, &quot;each of the 14 restored rooms, recreated from contemporary accounts and personal recollections&quot; features the career of one former bishop. The Faith Museum of world religion and a huge glass greenhouse were under construction on Castle property.

Other attractions already operating at or near the Castle include the Mining Art Gallery (in a nearby former bank building in the town centre) showing work mainly by self-taught or night school-educated miners; this attraction opened in 2017 (thanks to support provided to the Castle Trust by Bishop Auckland and Shildon AAP and Durham County Council); a 7.5 acre open-air theatre, Kynren, on the other side of the River Wear, with a cast of 1,000 depicting the history of England; and the Bishop Trevor Gallery at the Castle. The latter started displaying the National Gallery&#x27;s Masterpiece touring exhibit in October 2019.

In future, other attractions were expected to open in or near the town centre: a display of Spanish art (in another former bank building) the Faith Museum (already being built in 2019 as the Castle), a gallery that will feature medieval to later era artworks, a boutique hotel (in former pubs) and two restaurants in addition to the current bishop&#x27;s Kitchen café.

According to The Guardian, &quot;The aim is to make the town – the heart of the abandoned Durham coalfields – a tourist destination that holds people for a day or two rather than just a couple of hours. The scheme will create hundreds of entry-level jobs in a county that suffers high unemployment and has some of the most deprived areas in northern Europe&quot;.

A Financial Times report in early November 2019 stated that &quot;Kynren [theatre] has attracted 250,000 people and the Auckland Project, even with the castle closed, welcomed 35,500 visitors in the past year&quot; to this community.

==Governance==
===Historic===

For a large part of the area&#x27;s history, the autonomous powers held by the bishop of Durham meant that the county operated as a principality under England&#x27;s protectorate. The UNESCO site describes the role of the bishops in the &quot;buffer state between England and Scotland&quot;:From 1075, the Bishop of Durham became a Prince-Bishop, with the right to raise an army, mint his own coins, and levy taxes. As long as he remained loyal to the king of England, he could govern as a virtually autonomous ruler, reaping the revenue from his territory, but also remaining mindful of his role of protecting England&#x27;s northern frontier.

A steward of Bishop Antony Bek in the thirteenth century is quoted as saying England had two kings; the king and the bishop of Durham. A 1788 report states that the Bishops had the authority to appoint judges and barons and to offer pardons. The bishops of Durham were not stripped of the last of their secular powers until shortly after the death of Bishop William Van Mildert in 1836 by the Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836.

===Modern===
At the end of the nineteenth century the Local Government Act 1894 created Bishop Auckland Urban District council. From 1894 to 1974, the town was governed by the Urban District council within the administrative county of Durham. The district was enlarged to include a number of surrounding settlements in 1937 when Auckland Rural District and Willington Urban District were abolished. The Urban District was replaced, under the Local Government Act 1972, by a two tier district (Wear Valley) and county system.

The former urban district area was re-parished from the May 2007 local elections with a new town council was established. After the elections, the council elected Barbara Laurie as the town&#x27;s first re-established mayor. On 25 July 2007, Durham County Council and Wear Valley District Council were replaced on 1 April 2009 by a single unitary authority serving the whole of County Durham.

===Parliament===
The town is a part of the Bishop Auckland parliamentary constituency, and is currently represented at Westminster by Sam Rushworth MP (Labour).

Prior to Brexit, for the European Parliament its residents voted to elect MEP&#x27;s for the North East England constituency.

Bishop Auckland is twinned with the French town of Ivry-sur-Seine, whilst the wider Wear Valley district was twinned with Bad Oeynhausen in Germany.

=== Town Hall ===

The Town Hall is a &quot;Gothic style&quot; Victorian Building overlooking the town&#x27;s market place and is Grade II* listed. After being abandoned and then condemned for demolition in the 1980s, the town hall was fully restored in the early 1990s. It now houses the town&#x27;s main public library, a theatre, an art gallery, tourist information centre and a café-bar.

The Town Hall has held three exhibitions for mining artist Tom Lamb. The first was held in 1999 for his &#x27;Fading Memories&#x27; exhibition, then in 2004 for Lamb&#x27;s &#x27;The Footprints of My Years&#x27; exhibition and in 2008 the last exhibition called &#x27;My Mining Days&#x27; was held.

==Geography==
Bishop Auckland is located at (British national grid reference system: ) on the Durham coalfield at the confluence of the River Wear with its tributary the River Gaunless. The town nestles in the rivers&#x27; valley about above sea level. Besides this the town is all but is surrounded on all sides by hills ranging in height from around above sea level to over above sea level.

Bishop Auckland is located about northwest of Darlington and southwest of Durham. The town is served by Bishop Auckland railway station, which marks the point where the Tees Valley Line becomes the Weardale Railway. The town is not served directly by any motorways.

Notable wards include Cockton Hill, Woodhouse Close, and Henknowle. Additionally, once neighbouring villages such as South Church, Tindale Crescent, St Helen Auckland, and West Auckland now more or less merge seamlessly into the town.
== Demography ==
According to the 2001 census, Bishop Auckland has a population of 24,392, living in 10,336 dwellings. Of these dwellings, around 44% are terraced houses, 33% semi-detached houses, and 17% detached houses. As shown in the graph, the distribution of ages in Bishop Auckland was broadly in-line with that of County Durham and England and Wales, although there is a slightly smaller proportion of people between 20 and 24 years old.

Compared with the national average, the town&#x27;s population performs poorly with regard to qualifications. At 31.9%, the proportion of the town&#x27;s population with no qualifications is significantly higher than the national average of 23.2% and 29.1%. Similarly, only 13.8% have a degree level qualification (or higher) compared with the national average of 21.1%.

== Landmarks ==
The town has a number of Grade I listed buildings. The grounds of Auckland Castle alone contain seven such structures. Additionally Escomb Saxon Church, St Andrew&#x27;s parish church, St Helen&#x27;s church, St Helen Hall, West Auckland Manor House, the East Deanery and the 14th century Bishop Skirlaw bridge are all Grade I listed. Other notable buildings include the town hall, a Victorian railway viaduct and Binchester Roman fort.

=== Auckland Castle ===
Auckland Castle (often known locally as &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s palace&quot;), was the official residence of the Bishop of Durham since 1832 until 2012. However, its history goes back much earlier, being established as a hunting lodge for the bishops of Durham. The castle is surrounded by of parkland, which was originally used by the Bishops for hunting and is today open to the public. The castle and its grounds contain seven Grade I listed structures.

The castle&#x27;s long dining room is home to 12 of the 13 17th century portraits of Jacob and his 12 sons painted by Francisco de Zurbarán, which were saved by Bishop Trevor in 1756. Trevor was unable to secure the 13th, Benjamin, so commissioned Arthur Pond to produce a copy, which hangs alongside the 12 other originals.

Auckland Castle also provides the setting for Lewis Carroll&#x27;s story &quot;A Legend of Scotland&quot;.

As discussed in the Tourism section, the Castle re-opened in early November 2019, after a multi-million pound restoration. Additional work continued at and near the castle to make the town a significant tourist attraction. Reports suggests that the revival of the area, dubbed the Auckland Project, will eventually cost a total of about £150m.

=== Binchester Roman Fort ===
The route of the Roman road Dere Street passes straight through the middle of the town on its way to the nearby Roman Fort at Binchester. Binchester Roman Fort, or &quot;Vinovia&quot; as it was known to the Romans, has one of the best preserved examples of a Roman military bath house hypocaust in the country. Bishop Auckland&#x27;s main shopping street, Newgate Street, together with Cockton Hill Road and Watling Road faithfully follow the route of Dere Street. Watling Road should not be confused with the Roman road Watling Street, which is in the South of England.

==Transport==

The town has links with the birth of the railways, with the original 1825 route of the Stockton and Darlington Railway passing through West Auckland. Timothy Hackworth, a well-known locomotive builder, built steam locomotives in the neighbouring town of Shildon.

Today, Bishop Auckland railway station still provides passenger services, and is located at the end of the Tees Valley line. Since May 2010 it has been re-connected with the Weardale Railway, which provides passenger services up the valley to Stanhope. The town centre had a large railway goods yard until 1972. Freight traffic ceased to use the line completely in 1993 when Blue Circle cement stopped using the line to transport cement from its works in Eastgate.

The nearest airport to the town is Teesside Airport at around drive South-East of Bishop Auckland. The nearest motorway junction is Junction 60 of the A1(M), which is around away.

The town has a bus station with a number of bus routes serving the town. Following the withdrawal of Go North East from the town on 8 April 2006, most of these services are provided by Arriva North East. However, a number of smaller firms such as Weardale Buses also serve the town.

=== Newton Cap viaduct ===

The town also has a Grade II listed Victorian railway viaduct crossing the River Wear. At high, the viaduct provides views of the surrounding countryside below as well as Auckland Castle, the Bishop&#x27;s Park and the Town Hall on approaching the town from the Viaduct. It was originally built in 1857 to carry the Bishop Auckland to Durham City railway line across the River Wear and the Newton Cap Bank that leads down to the river. The railway closed in 1968 and the viaduct fell into a period of disuse and was at one point threatened with demolition. However, in 1995, the viaduct was converted for vehicle use to take traffic on the A689 between Bishop Auckland and Crook, relieving the Grade I listed fourteenth-century single-lane Bishop Skirlaw bridge which sits in the valley below it.

On the north side of the bridge sits Eleven Arches Flatts Farm (named after the number of arches in the viaduct) which hosts Kynren, a local historical performance.

==Education==

The town itself has three secondary schools—St John&#x27;s Catholic School, The Bishop Barrington Academy and King James I Academy. The town also has a college, Bishop Auckland College serving the Further Education and Higher Education fields. Both Bishop Barrington and King James schools have long histories, being founded in 1810 by Bishop Barrington and in 1604 on the orders of King James I respectively.

In the government&#x27;s Level 2 CVA (Contextual Value Added) statistic, which measures how much a school improves students between the end of National Curriculum Key Stage 2 and the end of Key Stage 4, compared with how much other schools in the country improve students with similar circumstances, King James scored 1039.9 points, Barrington 1019.3 points and St John&#x27;s scored a below average 997.4 points (with 1000 points being the target baseline).

At A-Level in 2009, none of the towns sixth form centres average points scores reached the national average of 739.1 A-Level points per student or the LEA average of 664.1 points. Amongst sixth form centres in the town, St John&#x27;s performed best with an average score of 661.5 points per student. In comparison, King James had an average A-Level score of 557 points and Bishop Auckland College with 459.3 points taking last position in the LEA in terms of A-Level point score, a position occupied by King James in the previous year. The Bishop Barrington Academy no longer has its own sixth form, with the school being a feeder for Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College in Darlington. The average A-Level points score at Queen Elizabeth is 871.8. The needs of those with special educational needs are served by Evergreen Primary.

The town is served also by the following primary schools; Cockton Hill Infant, Cockton Hill Junior, Copeland Road Primary, Etherley Lane Primary, Oakley Cross Primary, St Andrew&#x27;s Primary, St Anne&#x27;s CofE Primary, St Helen Auckland Community Primary, St Wilfrid&#x27;s RC Primary, Woodhouse Community Primary, Evergreen Primary School, Prince Bishops Community Primary School.

Durham University&#x27;s Zurbarán Centre for Spanish and Latin American Art is located at Roper House in the centre of Bishop Auckland and offers postgraduate degrees (MA and PhD).

==Public services==

===Healthcare===
As is the case with the rest of the United Kingdom, the population of the town is served by the National Health Service (NHS). The town has its own NHS hospital, Bishop Auckland General Hospital. The current Bishop Auckland General Hospital has 286 beds, and since opening in 2002 has become a centre specialising in routine surgery. Although Bishop Auckland General Hospital was built with an Accident and Emergency department, this was closed and replaced with an &quot;Urgent Care Centre&quot; in 2009, when the local NHS trust concentrated acute health care services at Durham and Darlington, and moved more routine surgery to Bishop Auckland General.

The new hospital was a PFI project and was announced by the Labour government in the summer of 1997. and temporary huts constructed during World War II.

Other local hospitals include Darlington Memorial Hospital and University Hospital of North Durham, which has replaced Durham Dryburn and was announced on the same day as the new Bishop Auckland General. All three of these hospitals are run by County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust, which provides secondary health care services in the area. The local ambulance service is North East Ambulance Service.

===Utilities===
Bishop Auckland&#x27;s water and sewerage is managed by Northumbrian Water. Water supply comes from Burnhope Reservoir via the Wear Valley water treatment works at Wearhead. The present treatment works replaced old works on the site of the present one and another one closer to the town at Tunstall Reservoir. Contrary to popular belief, the town does not receive water from Kielder Reservoir. Although water from Kielder can be pumped into the River Wear, via the Tyne–Tees tunnel, upstream at Frosterley, this water is not abstracted from the river until it reaches Chester-le-Street. Equally, although water can be pumped from the tunnel into Waskerley Reservoir, which in turn supplies Tunstall Reservoir, Tunstall water treatment works was closed in 2004, when the new Wear Valley works was brought into service.

The electricity distribution network operator for the area is the CE Electric-owned NEDL (Northern Electric Distribution Limited). There are no power stations in the town.

Three grade II listed churches are in the town: Bishop Auckland Methodist Church on Cockton Hill Road,
 St Anne&#x27;s church next to the town hall in the Market Place, and St Peter&#x27;s Church on Princes Street.

===Nearby villages===

The nearby village of Escomb is home to a complete Anglo-Saxon church. It is believed the church was built between the years 670 and 690. Much of the stone used to construct the church came from the nearby Roman fort at Binchester, with some stones having Roman markings on them. The church is a Grade I listed structure.

St Andrew&#x27;s church located in the adjoining village of South Church is the largest church in County Durham and a Grade I listed building. The church was built in the thirteenth century and acted as a collegiate church.

Bishop Auckland is famous for its amateur football team, Bishop Auckland F.C., which won the FA Amateur Cup a record 10 times in the Trophy&#x27;s 80-year history, having appeared in the Final on 18 occasions.
Bishop Auckland Football Club also helped out Manchester United after the Munich air disaster in 1958 by donating three of their players, Derek Lewin, Bob Hardisty and Warren Bradley. In return in 1996, Manchester United played a friendly against Bishop Auckland to help raise money when the club was threatened with bankruptcy after a member of a rival team sued over an injury. In 2007 Manchester United donated floodlights to Bishop Auckland Football Club, which the club has added to their new ground, Heritage Park. These floodlights have subsequently been upgraded to LED.

<text>Aston is an area of inner Birmingham, in the county of the West Midlands, England. Located immediately to the north-west of Central Birmingham, Aston constitutes a ward within the metropolitan authority. It is approximately from Birmingham City Centre.

==History==
Aston was first mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 as &quot;Estone&quot;, having a mill, a priest and therefore probably a church, woodland and ploughland. The Church of Saints Peter and Paul was built in medieval times to replace an earlier church. The body of the church was rebuilt by J. A. Chatwin during the period 1879 to 1890; the 15th-century tower and spire, which was partly rebuilt in 1776, being the only survivors of the medieval building.

The ancient parish of Aston (known as Aston juxta Birmingham) was large. It was separated from the parish of Birmingham by AB Row, which currently exists in the Eastside of the city at just 50 yards in length. Aston, as Aston Manor, was governed by a Local Board from 1869 and was created as an Urban District Council in 1903 before being absorbed in the expansion of the County Borough of Birmingham in 1911, and a further part, Saltley was added in 1911. 
In 1911 the civil parish had a population of 219,082. On 1 April 1912 the parish was abolished and merged with Birmingham. Old buildings which became popular within Aston included the Aston Hippodrome and the Bartons Arms public house. Gospel Hall on Park Lane was opened in 1892 and demolished in the 1970s to be rebuilt at the top of Park Lane in 1979. The original hall had a seating capacity of 73. Another meeting place was the Ellen Knox Memorial Hall which was next door to the Midland Vinegar Brewery. The brewery was owned by the Midland Brewery Company was built around 1877. It was located on Upper Thomas Street. The brewery was a three-storey brick building with rounded corners, semi-circular windows and a slated roof. Other industry that was located in Aston include the Premier Motor Works which produced cars during the early 20th century. The works were situated at the junction of Aston Road and Dartmouth Street. On Miller Street was a tramcar depot which had a storage capacity of 104 tramcars. It opened in 1904 latterly being operated by the City of Birmingham Tramways Company Ltd on behalf of the Urban District Council before formally passing to Birmingham Corporation Tramways on 1 January 1912.
Aston underwent large scale redevelopment following the Second World War. South Aston was designated a renewal area involving comprehensive redevelopment of the traditional area known as &quot;Aston New Town&quot;. The area, was more commonly called simply &quot;Newtown&quot; and is a large estate consisting of sixteen tower blocks, five of which have since been demolished. The project was approved in 1968. Three 20-storey tower blocks on the complex contained 354 flats alone.
Today, Aston gives its name to Aston Villa F.C. and Aston University (the campus of which is not in Aston but about 1.3 miles to the south in Birmingham city centre). Aston University is one of four universities in Birmingham. Aston Villa have played at Villa Park since 1897, and it has traditionally been one of the largest football grounds in England that has staged many notable matches at club and international level. The park has also hosted other sports and events including international level rugby league and rugby union. This is one of the main attractions in this town.

Much of Aston consists of terraced houses that were built around the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Some of these houses were demolished in the late 1960s to make way for the Aston Expressway, which links Birmingham city centre to the M6 motorway. In the late 1950s, Aston was the location of the famous &#x27;Venus Baby&#x27; case of Cynthia Appleton (87 Fentham Road).

By the early 1980s, Aston was suffering from severe deprivation with many of the terraced houses being outdated for the requirements of the time. Many of them lacked bathrooms and indoor toilets, whilst the vast majority were suffering from decay as a result of a lack of maintenance. There was speculation that the homes would be demolished, but Birmingham City Council made money available to the homeowners for them to be brought up to modern standards.

From 2001 to 2011, Aston underwent a £54 million Birmingham regeneration project named &quot;Aston Pride&quot;, as part of the New Deal for Communities scheme in 2001. Many improvements were made, including reducing burglary, robbery and vehicle crime; spending £4 million on a health centre; and helping more than 1300 people find work (more than the target of 400).

==Crime==
Crime levels in Aston have remained stagnant in recent years. In December 2010, there were 369 reported crimes, the majority being for antisocial behaviour, while in December 2019, there were 328, mostly for violent offences. The crime rate in the ward is 10.35, which is higher than in other areas like Handsworth Wood (6.59) but lower than Nechells (16.6).

The majority of the crime is of the nature of violence, antisocial behaviour, vehicle crime, and robbery.

On 2 January 2003, gunmen shot at three innocent teenage girls who were celebrating the New Year in the Birchfield area near Aston. Two of the girls were killed and another was seriously injured. More than 18 bullets were fired from at least two weapons. Four men were later tried and found guilty of murder in March 2005. Marcus Ellis (the half-brother of one of the two dead girls), Nathan Martin and Michael Gregory were sentenced to life imprisonment with recommended minimum terms of 35 years on two charges of murder and three of attempted murder. A fourth man, Rodrigo Simms, received life with a recommended minimum of 27 years for the same crimes. A fifth defendant, Jermaine Carty, had walked free from court after being cleared of possessing a firearm. The four men convicted were members of a notorious local gang known as the Burger Bar Boys, who had been trying to exact revenge on members of their rival gang the Johnson Crew: a notorious local gang originating in the mid-1980s.

==Politics==
The Aston ward is represented by two Liberal Democrat councillors: Mumtaz Hussain and Ayoub Khan.

In 2004, the ward saw a voter fraud scandal in which Labour councillors were accused of a systematic attempt to rig elections. They had set up a &quot;vote-rigging factory&quot; in a disused warehouse, stealing and intercepting hundreds and possibly thousands of ballot papers to achieve this. Three councillors, Mohammed Islam, Muhammad Afzal (later cleared of wrongdoing) and Mohammed Kazi were accused of voter fraud, with the elections having to be rerun. All three were barred from standing in the following election.

Aston is part of the Birmingham Ladywood constituency, held by Labour since 1940 and represented by Labour MP Shabana Mahmood since 2010.

==Demographics==

The 2011 census found that 22,636 people were living in Aston. It is the sixth most populous ward in the city.

It is a very ethnically diverse community, with 44% of the population born outside the United Kingdom. The largest ethnic group was Asian at 69.1%. More specifically, the Pakistani ethnic group was the largest at 30.9% of all Asians. Black British was the second largest ethnic group at 16.4%. White British was the third largest ethnic group at 7.8%.

The ethnic makeup of the area drastically changed in the 1950s and 1960s with immigration from the Commonwealth. Most of the immigrants were from the Indian subcontinent most notably from Pakistan, though a significant number were also from the Caribbean.

Aston is a young ward, with 33.5% of the population under 18, compared to the Birmingham average of 25.5%.

31.7% of residents in Aston have no qualifications, higher than the Birmingham average of 20.8%. Moreover, 15.6% do not speak English as their main language and cannot speak it well, well above the national average of 1.9%.

Aston has one of the highest rates of unemployment in the city, with 57.8% of residents classed as economically active compared to the city average of 69.3% and national average of 77%. It is the 11th most deprived ward in the city.

The majority of employed residents (56%) work in lower skilled occupations, such as caring, leisure and sales. The average income in Aston (£12,033) is 35% less than the average income (£18,788) in England as a whole.

==Education==

There are three secondary schools in Aston: Broadway Academy, refurbished and opened by the Duke of Kent in 2011, King Edward VI Aston, the only grammar school in the constituency, and Aston Manor School.

There are seven primary schools: Aston Tower Community Primary School, Birchfield Community School, Manor Park Primary Academy, Mansfield Green E-ACT Academy, Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School, Prince Albert Primary School, and Yew Tree Community School.

Aston Library and Birchfield Library are within the ward. Birmingham City Council planned to permanently close Aston Library in 2017 to save money; however, the decision was reversed after public consultation, and it is now run by community organisations.

== Aston Cross ==
Aston Cross was once the home of Ansells Brewery and HP Sauce. The six-acre Aston site was purchased by developer Chancerygate in 2007 at £800,000 per acre, but they subsequently sold it for half that price and it now houses a distribution warehouse for East End Foods. Aston Manor Brewery (Now Aston Manor Cider) was started in Thimble Mill Lane in 1982 by former employees of Ansell&#x27;s after Ansells&#x27; Aston Brewery closed.

From 1956 to 1969, Aston Cross was the Midlands base of Associated Television (ATV) which had its Alpha Studios on Aston Road North. The ATV office building later became the studios of radio stations BRMB and Xtra-AM. Although both stations moved to Birmingham&#x27;s Broad Street in the early 1990s, the building is still called Radio House. Launching in February 1974, BRMB was the UK&#x27;s fourth Independent Local Radio station and, while in Aston, was the most listened to radio station in the West Midlands.

<doc id="342998" wikidata="Q216402" url="?curid=342998" title="Winged Victory of Samothrace">
<text>The Winged Victory of Samothrace, or the Niké of Samothrace, is a votive monument originally discovered on the island of Samothrace in the northeastern Aegean Sea. It is a masterpiece of Greek sculpture from the Hellenistic era, dating from the beginning of the 2nd century BC (190 BC). It is composed of a statue representing the goddess Niké (Victory), whose head and arms are missing and its base is in the shape of a ship&#x27;s bow.

The total height of the monument is including the socle; the statue alone measures . The sculpture is one of a small number of major Hellenistic statues surviving in the original, rather than Roman copies.

&quot;Winged Victory&quot; has been exhibited at the Louvre in Paris, at the top of the main staircase, since 1884. Greece is seeking the return of the sculpture.

==Discovery and restorations==

===In the 19th century===
In 1863, Charles Champoiseau (1830–1909), acting chief of the Consulate of France in Adrianopolis (now Edirne in Turkey), undertook from March 6 to May 7 the exploration of the ruins of the sanctuary of the Great Gods on the island of Samothrace. On April 13, 1863, he discovered part of the bust and the body of a large female statue in white marble accompanied by numerous fragments of drapery and feathers. He recognised this as the goddess Niké, Victory, traditionally represented in Greek antiquity as a winged woman. In the same place was a jumble of about fifteen large grey marble blocks whose form or function was unclear: he concluded it was a funerary monument. He decided to send the statue and fragments to the Louvre Museum, and to leave the large blocks of grey marble on site. Departing Samothrace at the beginning of May 1863, the statue arrived in Toulon at the end of August and in Paris on May 11, 1864.

A first restoration was undertaken by Adrien Prévost de Longpérier, then curator of Antiquities at the Louvre, between 1864 and 1866. The main part of the body (2.14 m from the upper belly to the feet) is erected on a stone base, and largely completed by fragments of drapery, including the fold of himation that flares behind the legs on the Nike. The remaining fragments – the right part of the bust and a large part of the left wing – too incomplete to be placed on the statue, are stored. Given the exceptional quality of the sculpture, Longpérier decided to present the body alone, exhibited until 1880 among the Roman statues, first in the Caryatid Room, then briefly in the Tiber Room.

Beginning in 1875, Austrian archaeologists who, under the direction of Alexander Conze, had been excavating the buildings of the Samothrace sanctuary since 1870, studied the location where Champoiseau had found the Victory. Architect Aloïs Hauser drew the grey marble blocks left on-site and apprehended that, once properly assembled, they would form the tapered bow of a warship, and that, placed on a base of slabs, they served as the basis for the statue. Tetradrachmas of Demetrios Poliorcetes struck between 301 and 292 BC, representing a Victory on the bow of a ship, wings outstretched, give a good idea of this type of monument. For his part, the specialist in ancient sculpture Otto Benndorf studied the body of the statue and the fragments kept in reserve at the Louvre and restored the statue blowing into a trumpet that she raises with her right arm, as on the coin. The two men thus managed to make a model of the Samothrace monument as a whole.

Champoiseau, informed of this research, undertook a second mission to Samothrace from August 15 to 29, 1879, for the sole purpose of sending the blocks of the base and the slabs of the Victory base to the Louvre. He abandoned on the island the largest block of the base, unsculpted. Two months later, the blocks reached the Louvre Museum, where in December an assembly test was carried out in a courtyard.

The curator of the Department of Antiquities, Félix Ravaisson-Mollien, then decided to reconstruct the monument, in accordance with the model of Austrian archaeologists. On the body of the statue, between 1880 and 1883 he restored the belt area in plaster, placed the right part of the marble bust, recreated the left part in plaster, attached the left marble wing with a metal frame, and replaced the entire right wing with a plaster model. But he did not reconstruct the head, arms or feet. The ship-shaped base is rebuilt and completed, except for the broken bow of the keel, and there is still a large void at the top aft. The statue was placed directly on the base. The entire monument was then placed from the front, on the upper landing of the Daru staircase, the main staircase of the museum.

Champoiseau returned to Samothrace a third time in 1891 to try to obtain the Victory&#x27;s head, but without success. He did however bring back debris from the drapery and base, a small fragment with an inscription and fragments of coloured plaster.

===In the 20th century===
The presentation of the Victory was modified in 1934 as part of a general redevelopment of the Daru museum and staircase, whose steps were widened and redecorated. The monument was staged to constitute the crowning of the staircase: it was advanced on the landing to be more visible from the bottom of the steps, and was put on a modern 45 cm-high block of stone, supposed to evoke a combat bridge at the bow of the ship. This presentation remained unchanged until 2013.

At the declaration of the Second World War in September 1939, the Victory statue was moved along with other artefacts to the Château de Valençay (Indre) until the Liberation, and was replaced at the top of the stairs without damage in July 1945.

American excavators from New York University, under the direction of Karl Lehmann, resumed exploration of the sanctuary of the Great Gods in Samothrace in 1938. In July 1950, they associated Louvre curator Jean Charbonneaux with their work, who discovered the palm of the statue&#x27;s right hand in the Victory site. Two fingers preserved at the Kunsthistorische Museum in Vienna since the Austrian excavations of 1875 were reattached to the palm. The palm and fingers were then deposited in the Louvre Museum, and displayed with the statue in 1954.

Two pieces of grey marble that were used to moor fishing boats on the beach below the sanctuary were retrieved and reassembled at the museum in 1952. These were studied in 1996 by Ira Mark and Marianne Hamiaux, who concluded that these pieces, jointed, constitute the block of the base abandoned by Champoiseau in 1879.

===In the 21st century===

An American team led by James R. McCredie digitized the entire sanctuary to allow its 3D reconstruction between 2008 and 2014. B. D. Wescoat led the resumption of the study of the Victory enclosure and the small basic fragments preserved in reserve.

In Paris, the Louvre Museum restored the entire monument with two objectives: to clean all the surfaces and improve the general presentation. The statue came down from its base to undergo scientific examination (UV, infrared, x-rays, microspectrography, marble analysis): traces of blue paint are detected on the wings and on a strip at the bottom of the mantle. The blocks of the base were disassembled one by one to be drawn and studied. The 19th-century restoration of the statue is preserved with a few details (thinning of the neck and attachment of the left arm), fragments preserved in reserve at the Louvre are added (feather at the top of the left wing, a fold at the back of the chitôn), the metal vice behind the left leg is removed. Castings of small joint fragments preserved in Samothrace are integrated into the base. A cast of the large ship block left in Samothrace was replaced by a metal base on a cylinder ensuring the proper balance of the statue. Once in place on the base, the colour contrast of the marbles of the two elements becomes obvious again. The whole is reassembled on a modern base, a little removed on the landing to facilitate the movement of visitors.

The Greek government considers the Winged Victory, like the Elgin Marbles, illegally plundered and wants it repatriated to Greece. &quot;If the French and the Louvre have a problem, we are ready to preserve and accentuate the Victory of Samothrace, if they return it to us&quot;, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Akis Gerondopoulos said in 2013.

==Description==

===The statue===
The statue, in white Parian marble, depicts a winged woman, the goddess of Victory (Niké), alighting on the bow of a warship.

The Nike is dressed in a long tunic (, ) in a very fine fabric, with a folded flap and belted under the chest. It was attached to the shoulders by two thin straps (the restoration is not accurate). The lower body is partially covered by a thick mantle (, ) rolled up at the waist and untied when uncovering the entire left leg; one end slides between the legs to the ground, and the other, much shorter, flies freely in the back. The mantle is falling, and only the force of the wind holds it on her right leg. The sculptor has multiplied the effects of draperies, between places where the fabric is plated against the body by revealing its shapes, especially on the belly, and those where it accumulates in folds deeply hollowed out casting a strong shadow, as between the legs. This extreme virtuosity concerns the left side and front of the statue. On the right side, the layout of the drapery is reduced to the main lines of the clothes, in a much less elaborate work.

The goddess advances, leaning on her right leg. The two feet that were bare have not been found. The right touched the ground, the heel still slightly raised; the left foot, the leg strongly stretched back, was still carried in the air. The goddess is not walking, she is finishing her flight, her large wings still spread out backwards. The arms were also not found, but the right shoulder raised indicates that the right arm was raised to the side. With her elbow bent, the goddess made a victorious gesture of salvation with her hand: this hand with outstretched fingers held nothing (neither trumpet nor crown). There is no clue to reconstructing the position of the left arm, probably lowered, very slightly bent; the goddess may have held a &quot;stylis&quot; (a naval standard) on this side, a kind of mast taken as a trophy on the enemy ship, as seen on coins. The statue is designed to be seen three quarters left (right for the spectator), from where the lines of the composition are very clear: a vertical from the neck to the right foot, and an oblique starting from the neck diagonally along the left leg. &quot;The whole body is inscribed in a rectangular triangle, a simple but very solid geometric figure: it was necessary to support both the fulfilled shapes of the goddess, the accumulation of draperies, and the energy of movement&quot;. Most recently the Alula feather was restored to the left wing in a flared position, as it would be for a bird landing.

The art historian H. W. Janson has pointed out that unlike earlier Greek or Near Eastern sculptures, the Nike creates a deliberate relationship to the imaginary space around the goddess. The wind that has carried her and which she is fighting off, straining to keep steady – as mentioned the original mounting had her standing on a ship&#x27;s prow, just having landed – is the invisible complement of the figure and the viewer is made to imagine it. At the same time, this expanded space heightens the symbolic force of the work; the wind and the sea are suggested as metaphors of struggle, destiny and divine help or grace. This kind of interplay between a statue and the space conjured up would become a common device in baroque and romantic art, about two thousand years later. It is present in Michelangelo&#x27;s sculpture of David: David&#x27;s gaze and pose show where he is seeing his adversary Goliath and his awareness of the moment – but it is rare in ancient art.

===The boat and the base===
These are carved from grey marble veined with white, identified as that of the quarries of Lartos, in Rhodes. The base has the shape of the bow of a Greek Hellenistic warship: long and narrow, it is covered at the front by a combat deck on which the statue is located. It has reinforced, projecting oar boxes on the sides that supported two rows of staggered oars (the oval oar slots are also depicted). The keel is rounded. At the bottom of the bow, at the waterline, a large triple-pronged spur would have been sculpted, and a little higher up, a smaller two-bladed ram that would have been used to smash the hull of the enemy ship would have been shown. The top of the bow was crowned by a high and curved bow ornament (the ). These missing elements have not been reconstructed, which greatly reduces the vessel&#x27;s warlike appearance.

Epigraphist Christian Blinkenberg thought that this bow was that of a , a type of warship often named in Rhodes inscriptions: the island&#x27;s shipyards were renowned, and its war fleet important. But specialists in ancient naval architecture do not agree on the ascription of the trihemolia. It can only be said that the Samothrace bow has boxes of oars and two benches of superimposed oars. Each oar being operated by several rowers, this can also be suitable for a quadrireme (4 files of rowers) or a quinquereme (5 files of rowers). These ships were widespread in all Hellenistic war fleets, including the Rhodian fleet.

===Dimensions and construction of the set===
*Total height: 5.57 m
*Statue height: 2.75 m with wings; 2.40 m body without head
*Ship height: 2.01 m; length: 4.29 m; width max.: 2.48 m
*Base height: 0.36 m; length: 4.76 m; width: 1.76 m

The Victory statue, about 1.6 times life size, is not cut from a single block of marble, but composed of six blocks worked separately: the body, the bust with the head, the two arms and the two wings. These blocks were assembled together by metal braces (bronze or iron). This technique, used for a long time by Greek sculptors for the protruding parts of statues, was used in Hellenistic times for the body itself, thus making it possible to use smaller pieces of marble, therefore less rare and less expensive. In the case of Victory, the sculptor optimized this technique by tilting the joint surfaces that connect the wings to the body by 20° forward, which ensured their cantilevered support in the back. To the body-block were added smaller projecting pieces: the end of the flying mantle at the back and the end of the fold falling to the ground in front of the left leg have been reattached; the right foot, the back of the left leg with the foot and a drapery fold in front of the legs are lost.

The ship is composed of 16 blocks divided into three increasingly wide assizes aft, placed on a rectangular base. The seventeenth block, which remained in Samothrace, completed the void at the back of the upper assembly, just under the statue. Its weight allowed the cantilever of the blocks of the protruding oar boxes to hold on the sides. The baseboard of the statue was embedded in a basin dug on this block. Its contours, fully visible during the 2014 restoration, made it possible to determine the location of the statue very precisely.

The statue and base are inseparable to ensure the balance of the monument, designed as a whole.

==Architectural context==

===The location===
The sanctuary of the Great Gods of Samothrace is located in a very narrow river valley. The buildings reserved for the Mysteries ceremonies occupied the entire bottom of the valley. From the 3rd century BC, the entrance to the site was a monumental propylaia to the east. To the west was a very long portico to house pilgrims (the stoa) and important offerings. The Victory Monument was located at the south end of the portico terrace, in a rectangular space dug into the hillside, and set back and raised from the theatre; facing north, it overlooks the entire sanctuary. In 1863 Champoiseau described and drew the monument surrounded on three sides by a limestone wall. All that remains of this enclosure now are the foundations of the walls, surrounded at the bottom and sides by walls supporting the lands of the hill. The enclosure itself is 13.40 m wide by 9.55 m long, and we know from the surveys made by Hauser in 1876 that the Victory was arranged obliquely 14.5° from the back wall. This arrangement highlights the left side of the statue for the observer from the terrace, which explains why the sculpture work is much more elaborate on this side than on the other. Large natural rocks are visible in the front part of the space. The foundation walls have been restored and the place of the monument artificially indicated.

===Interpretation===

The reconstructed whole has given rise to various interpretations. K. Lehmann hypothesized that the monument was placed in the basin of an open-air fountain, with water effects on the large rocks arranged for this purpose. But they could not be part of the original layout since the palm of the right hand was found under one of them: Charbonneau thought they came from a later natural landslide. The fountain hypothesis has been abandoned since the excavations of J. McCredie and B. Wescoat demonstrated that there was no water supply to the enclosure.

Recent research has not determined the exact nature of the Victory&#x27;s architectural setting, more than 500 blocks of which have been reused in a Byzantine construction at the other end of the west hill. Fragments of coloured plaster and some elements of terracotta architectural decoration were found in the enclosure. Two 3D reconstructions have been proposed by B. Wescoat: either low walls forming a peribolos around the open-air monument, or a covered building with columns and pediment of the naiskos type. The excellent state of conservation of the sculpture&#x27;s surface suggests that it did not stay in the open air for long. The overall reconstruction of the sanctuary in 3D also highlighted that the statue of Victory was oriented along the axis of the river, which was the only unobstructed perspective of the sanctuary: the monument was thus clearly visible from the bottom of the valley.

Another hypothesis was proposed by Jean Richer (archaeologist) who observed that the ship on which the statue is placed represents the constellation of the Argo: the ship&#x27;s bow and the statue had been deliberately placed at an angle, within the important Sanctuary of the Great Gods of Samothrace, so that Victory looked northward: according to Richer, this direction shows the path that leads to the gate of the gods identified at Mount Hemos, and thus alludes to a spiritual victory; for, in this orientation, the momentum and gaze of the statue were directed at the northeast corner of the Anaktoron, seat of the Little Mysteries, where initiation was given. This angle was thus the most sacred of the building.

==Function, date and style==

===An offering===
In the sanctuary of the Great Gods of Samothrace, as in all the great pan-Hellenic shrines, the faithful offered their ex-votos, from the most modest to the most sumptuous according to their wealth. It was a way to honour the gods and thank them for their benefits. In addition to a promise of a better spiritual life, the Cabeiri gods, including the Dioscuri, were reputed to ensure their protection to those who were initiated into their Mysteries if they were in danger at sea and in combat. Summoning them allowed their initiates to be saved from shipwreck and to obtain victory. In this context, a representation of Victory landing on a ship&#x27;s bow can be interpreted as an offering to thank the Great Gods following an important naval victory.

Several major naval offerings were known in the 3rd century BC. In the Greek world, such as the &quot;bull monument&quot; in Delos, the naval monument of the agora in Cyrene and Samothrace itself, the Neorion (No. 6 on the map), which housed a ship about twenty meters long. In Rhodes, an offering of the same type as the base of Samothrace, but smaller, was found in the sanctuary of Athena at the top of the acropolis of Lindos.

===Dating===

The dedication inscription of the Victory Monument has not been found. Archaeologists are reduced to hypothesizing to define the historical context and to determine the naval victory justifying the erection of such an important . The difficulty lies in the fact that in the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC naval battles to dominate the Aegean Sea were very numerous, first pitting the Antigonids and their Seleucid allies against the Lagids, then the Seleucids to the Rhodians and Pergamon.

Austrian archaeologists first considered that the monument of Samothrace is the one represented on the tetradrachma of Demetrios Poliorcetes. They conclude that, like the coin, he celebrated his victory against Ptolemy I at the Battle of Salamis at Cyprus in 306 BC. According to Benndorf, the Victory of Samothrace therefore dates from the last years of the fourth century BC. and may have been sculpted by a student of sculptor Scopas.

The construction of the monument was then related to the Battle of Cos (around 262–255 BC), during which the King of Macedonia Antigonus II Gonatas defeated the Lagids, allied with Athens and Sparta during the Chremonidean War. Antigonus Gonatas is also credited with the dedication, at the same time, of his flagship in the Neorium in Delos.

The material of the base of the Victory of Samothrace was identified as early as 1905 as marble from the quarries of Lartos in Rhodes. The same is true of the small fragment found in 1891 by Champoiseau within the walls of the monument to Samothrace, bearing the end of an engraved name: . In 1931, Hermann Thiersch restored the name of the sculptor &quot;Pythokritos son of Timocharis of Rhodes&quot;, active around 210–165 BC. He was convinced that the fragment belongs to the ship-shaped base: he therefore made this sculptor the author of the Victory of Samothrace. According to him, the monument was commissioned by the Rhodians, allies in the kingdom of Pergamos against Antiochus III, after their victory at the naval battles of Side and Myonnesos, on the Ionian coast, in 190 BC. Excavations revealed that the sculpture was positioned alighting on a flagship, that was set in the ground in a way that it looked as it was floating. The definitive victory against the Seleucids came in 189 BC. at the Battle of Sipyla Magnesia. The monument was therefore reportedly erected in Samothrace shortly after that date. Jean Charbonneaux also admits the historical link between the Victory of Samothrace and the battles of Myonnesus and Magnesia, and makes it the dedication of King Eumene II.

Based on the same arguments, Nathan Badoud in 2018 favoured the conflict that earlier pitted the Rhodians and the King of Pergamon against King Philip V of Macedonia. The Rhodians were first defeated at the naval Battle of Lade in 201 BC. Then Philip V was defeated at sea by the two allies at the Battle of Chios in 201 BC. Rhodes and Pergamon called on the Roman Republic for reinforcements, and Titus Quinctius Flamininus crushed the Macedonian army in Thessaly with the Battle of Cynoscephalae. The Rhodians reportedly dedicated the Victory Monument after that date, for their victory in Chios.

Other researchers have considered later occasions: the victory of the Romans at Pydna in 168 BC. over Perseus, or a consecration of the kingdom of Pergamon at the same time, or the victory of Pergamon and Rhodes against Prusias II of Bithynia in 154 BC.

===Style and workshop===

Although the supposed dedication inscription of the name of a Rhodian found at the Victory&#x27;s base was very quickly contested because of its small size, the entire monument remained attributed to the Rhodian sculpture school. This made it possible to put an end to previous doubts about the style of the statue. In 1955 Margarete Bieber made him a major figure in the &quot;Rhodian school&quot; and the &quot;Hellenic Baroque&quot;, next to the frieze of the Gigantomachy of the Great Altar of Pergamon, characterized by the strength of attitudes, the virtuosity of the draperies and the expressiveness of the figures. This style lasted in Rhodes until Roman times in complex and monumental creations such as the Laocoon group or Sperlonga sculptures attributed or signed by Rhodian sculptors.

The base blocks and the sculpture of the statue are not by the same hand. The two parts of the monument were designed together, but produced by two different workshops. The marble base of Lartos was certainly made in Rhodes, where there are parallels. Moreover, the Rhodian sculpture in large marble is of high quality, without being exceptional for its time, but there are no parallels for the virtuosity of the Nike, which remains unusual. The sculptor could also come from elsewhere, as was common in the ancient Greek world for great artists. The Victory of Samothrace is a grandiose adaptation of the moving statue of the Athena-Niké of the Cyrene monument: the sculptor added wings, stretched out the front leg to express the flight, and modified the arrangement of the mantle with the floating panel at the back. He thus gave the statue of Samothrace a dynamic that brings it closer to the figures the Gigantomachy of the altar of Pergamon, conceived shortly after in the same spirit.
