<text>Jean-Lambert Tallien (, 23 January 1767 – 16 November 1820) was a French politician of the revolutionary period. Though initially an active agent of the Reign of Terror, he eventually clashed with its leader, Maximilien Robespierre, and is best known as one of the key figures of the Thermidorian Reaction that led to the fall of Robespierre and the end of the Terror.

==Early life and journalism==
Tallien was born in Paris to Lambert Tallien, the &quot;maître d&#x27;hôtel&quot; of the Marquis de Bercy, and Jeanne Lambert. The marquis, noticing his ability, had him educated, and got him a place as a lawyer&#x27;s clerk. Supportive of the Revolution, he gave up his desk to enter a printer&#x27;s office, and by 1791 was overseer of the printing department of the Comte de Provence.

During his employment, he conceived the idea of the &quot;journal-affiche&quot;, and after the arrest of the king at Varennes in June 1791 he placarded a large printed sheet on all the walls of Paris twice a week, under the title of the &quot;L&#x27;Ami des Citoyens, journal fraternel&quot;. This enterprise had its expenses paid by the Jacobin Club and made Tallien well known to the revolutionary leaders. He became even more present in politics after organizing, together with Jean-Marie Collot d&#x27;Herbois, the great &quot;Fête de la Liberté&quot; on 15 April 1792, honouring the release of the Swiss &quot;régiment de Châteauvieux&quot;, imprisoned since the Nancy Mutiny of 1790.

===Paris Commune===
On 8 July 1792, he was the spokesman of a deputation of the section of the Place Royale which demanded from the Legislative Assembly the reinstatement of the Mayor, Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve, and the &quot;Procureur&quot;, Louis Pierre Manuel. Tallien was one of the most active popular leaders in the storming of the Tuileries Palace on 10 August; on that day he was appointed secretary to the insurrectional Commune of Paris. He committed himself to his new mission and habitually appeared at the bar of the Assembly on behalf of the Commune. He participated in the September Massacres of 1792, and, with the help of Georges Danton, would eventually be elected a member of the National Convention. 
He announced the September Massacres in terms of apology and praise, and he sent off the famous circular of 3 September to the French departments, recommending them to take similar action. At the same time, he had several people imprisoned in order to save them from the violence of the mob and protected several suspects himself.

==National Convention and missions==
Tallien resigned his post in the Commune on being elected, in spite of his youth, deputy to the National Convention by the &quot;department&quot; of Seine-et-Oise, and he began his legislative career by defending the conduct of the Commune during the massacres. He took his seat upon The Mountain, and showed himself one of the most vigorous Jacobins, particularly in his defence of Jean-Paul Marat, on 26 February 1793; he voted in favor of the execution of King Louis XVI, and was elected member of the Committee of General Security on 21 January 1793, the day of the King&#x27;s execution.

He was sent as representative on mission to the department of Indre-et-Loire in March 1793, and after returning to Paris took an active part in the insurrection of 31 May, which resulted in the overthrow of the Girondists. For the next few months he kept a low profile, but on 23 September 1793 Tallien was sent with Claude-Alexandre Ysabeau on a mission to Bordeaux. This was the month in which the Reign of Terror was organized under the superintendence of the Committees of Public Safety and Committee of General Security. On 6 October he arrived in Saint-Émilion to arrest suspect deputies. Not long after the introduction of the Law of 22 Prairial Pétion de Villeneuve and Francois Buzot committed suicide; Marguerite-Élie Guadet and Charles Barbaroux were guillotined.

Tallien was one of the most notorious envoys sent over to establish the Terror in the departments, and soon established a revolutionary grip on Bordeaux. The young Tallien, who was not yet 27, became notorious for his administration of justice in Bordeaux through his bloody affinity to &quot;feed &quot;la sainte guillotine&quot;&quot;. 
Tallien&#x27;s methodology of subjugation at Bordeaux has been described as &quot;fear and flour&quot;: the guillotining of Girondist leaders and exploitation of food shortages by withholding bread from the already-hungry province. 
However, after the initial days of his mission in Bordeaux, Tallien began to shift away from his bloody Terrorist tendencies. This tendency may be due to his romantic involvement with Thérésa Cabarrús, the daughter of Francisco Cabarrús and former wife of the émigré Marquis de Fontenay. Tallien not only spared her life but fell in love with her. As she was extremely wealthy and desired by many, it is possible that she became involved with Tallien in order to escape from the guillotine at Bordeaux and influence him to show lenience towards her aristocratic associates. Tallien suggested, &quot;It is better to marry than to be beheaded.&quot;

After Tallien became involved with Cabarrús, there was a notable decline in the number of executions in Bordeaux. Thérésa was a moderating influence, and for the lives she saved by her entreaties she received the name of &quot;Notre-Dame de Thermidor&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Thermidor&quot;) after the onset of the Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794. Tallien was elected president of the Convention on 24 March 1794 until 5 April and had to deal with the trial of Georges Danton and Camille Desmoulins.

==Thermidorian Reaction==

Tallien was recalled to Paris from Bordeaux after being denounced by the Committee of Public Safety for &quot;modérantisme&quot;. Cabarrús, who had accompanied him, was arrested for a second time and imprisoned. She was set to face trial and probably would have been executed. She sent a letter to Tallien on 26 July, which included a dagger and a note accusing him of weakness for not attempting to free her. Thérésa stated, &quot;I die in despair at having belonged to a coward like you.&quot; In Prairial (May–June) he was expelled from the Jacobin Club by Robespierre, and from then on Tallien became a leading conspirator for his overthrow, allying himself with other opposers of the Terror.

Robespierre&#x27;s own political ideas implied his readiness to strike at many of his colleagues in the committees, and Tallien was one of the men condemned. Robespierre&#x27;s rivals were determined to strike first. During a session at the National Convention on 9 Thermidor (27 July), Tallien interrupted Robespierre helper Louis Antoine de Saint-Just and, after going up to the tribune: &quot;Yesterday a member of the government was left quite isolated and made a speech in his own name; today another one has done the same thing. Tallien continued: &quot;Need I recall to you that expression addressed [by Robespierre] to the journalists in one of the last sittings of the Jacobins? &quot;I prohibit you from inserting my discourses in your papers till you have previously communicated them to me.&quot; He brandished a dagger and threatened to stab Robespierre in the chest if the Convention did not decree his accusation, calling him &quot;the new Cromwell&quot;. The movement was successful: Robespierre and his closest allies were arrested and guillotined on the next day. Tallien, as the leading Thermidorian, was elected to the Committee of Public Safety. He was instrumental in suppressing the Revolutionary Tribunal and the Jacobin Club; he attacked Jean-Baptiste Carrier and Joseph Le Bon, who had been representatives of the Committee to Nantes and Arras respectively, and he fought with energy against the insurgents of Prairial (20 May 1795).

Tallien&#x27;s actions and his motivation behind his shifting loyalties have been described thus: &quot;His only claim to a place in history was to have realized that people were sick of the terror, that the inevitable reaction was imminent, and that it was better to be a part of it than to be crushed by it.&quot; In all these months he was supported by Thérèse, whom he married on 26 December 1794, and who became the leader of the social life of Paris. This cemented Tallien&#x27;s transition from the infamous Terrorist at Bordeaux to the &quot;reformed terrorist&quot; of the Thermidorian reaction.

On 18th Thermidor, in order to secure the release of his mistress, to gain popular support, and to popularize his image as a Thermidorian (rather than a Jacobin), Tallien stated, &quot;There is not a single man in prison today who does not claim to be an ardent patriot and who has not been an enemy of Robespierre&#x27;s.&quot; In the next five days, nearly 500 prisoners, many of whom were moderates or right-wing opposition to Robespierre and the leftist Jacobins, were released. Tallien and the Thermidorians almost immediately repealed the law of 22 Prairial, ending the power of the Committee of Public Safety to arrest representatives without a hearing. In addition, measures were passed causing one-fourth of the Committee to be up for election each month, with a one-month period between the terms that deputies could serve on the Committee.

For Tallien&#x27;s role in 9 Thermidor, he was elected to the Committee of Public Safety. In a complete reversal of his earlier positions, Tallien appealed to the new rising class of the &quot;jeunesse dorée&quot; (&quot;gilded youth&quot;), who viewed him as their leader, by stating &quot;I sincerely admit that I had rather see twenty aristocrats set at liberty today and re-arrested tomorrow than see a single patriot left in chains.&quot; In addition, Tallien helped pass a measure that would publish the lists of the freed prisoners, helping ensure that the National Convention would be accountable for any imprisonments. Furthermore, he promoted a compromise that prevented a list of those who acted as guarantees for the loyalty of released prisoners. This prevented him from being publicly accountable for the release of his mistress and future wife. Shortly after, Tallien and his allies Freron and Lecointre were removed from the Jacobin clubs.

On the 23rd of Fructidor, an assassination attempt was made on Tallien. The minor gunshot wound and knife wound gave Tallien and his allies the necessary public support to begin their attacks on the Jacobin clubs. With the threat of a Jacobin-Terrorist plot in the air, Tallien and Freron used public proclamations and physical intimidation (through the &quot;jeunesse dorée&quot;) to wipe out the central Parisian Jacobin club. Tallien began campaigning for free speech in 1795. This increased his popularity with the &quot;jeunesse dorée&quot;, as many were journalists. He reestablished his paper, &quot;L&#x27;Ami des Citoyens&quot;, and contributed to the unified attack of the Thermidorians on the remaining Jacobins. Although the journalistic freedom gave the Jacobins the legal opportunity to also mount an attack through the press, their Thermidorian opponents were far more unified. Thermidorian journalists had even got into high positions on Jacobin newspapers.

In addition, the Thermidorians did nothing to stop the monarchist resurgence. Eventually, the Thermidorians ordered that all émigrés and émigré supporters hand over their weapons and expel all foreigners from the country. However, there is evidence that Tallien was arranging a compromise with Spain and would support the imposition of Louis XVIII as a king &quot;without the abuses&quot;. In July 1795, a large division of émigrés, with support from the British, attempted to invade through Quiberon. However, General Lazare Hoche outmaneuvered the émigrés and trapped them on the end of the Quiberon peninsula. Tallien was sent by the National Convention to the scene. Partially because Tallien had been corresponding with the Bourbons in Spain, he set up military commissions to put all of the émigré prisoners on trial. Under current law, all of the émigrés were convicted and summarily executed. Tallien was held responsible and lost support from the &quot;jeunesse dorée&quot; and Thermidorians. His political influence were thus greatly reduced.

==Council of Five Hundred and Egyptian campaign==
After the beginning of the French Directory, Tallien&#x27;s political importance came to an end, for, although he sat in the Council of Five Hundred, the moderates viewed him as an enforcer of the Terror, and the extreme party as a renegade. Madame Tallien also rejected him, and became the mistress of the rich banker Gabriel-Julien Ouvrard.

Napoleon Bonaparte, however, who is said to have been introduced by him to Paul Barras, took him on to his military expedition to Egypt of June 1798 as part of the political economy section of the Institut d&#x27;Égypte, and after the capture of Cairo, he edited the official journal there, the &quot;Décade Égyptienne&quot;. General Jacques François Menou sent him back to France. On his passage, he was captured by a British cruiser and taken to London, where he had a good reception among the Whigs and was received by Charles James Fox.

==Later years==
On returning to France in 1802 he obtained a divorce from Thérésa (who in 1805 married François-Joseph-Philippe de Riquet) and was left for some time without employment. Eventually, through the interventions of Joseph Fouché and Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, Tallien was appointed consul at Alicante, and remained there until he lost the sight of one eye from yellow fever.

Back in Paris, Tallien lived on half-pay until the fall of the Empire and the Bourbon Restoration in 1815, when he received the favour of not being exiled like the other &quot;regicides&quot; (those who had voted for the Louis XVI&#x27;s execution) due to his poor health. He spent his last years in poverty, living in a small house in the Allée des Veuves. He was forced to sell his collection of books in order to sustain himself, and in May 1818 asked the government of King Louis XVIII for some relief money, which was granted in 1000 francs by minister Élie Decazes. Tallien died of leprosy on 16 November 1820, and was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

<text>Julen Guerrero López (born 7 January 1974) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played solely for Athletic Bilbao as an attacking midfielder.

He appeared in 430 official games for his only club, scoring 116 goals and helping them to finish second in La Liga in the 1997–98 season.

A Spain international since 1993, Guerrero represented the country at the 1994 and 1998 World Cups, as well as Euro 1996.

==Club career==
Born in Portugalete, Biscay, Guerrero joined Athletic Bilbao as an eight-year-old, and subsequently progressed through the junior ranks of the club. Along with Aitor Karanka, he was a member of the under-19 team that won a national double of cup and league in 1991–92, and also appeared and scored for the reserves in the Segunda División during the same season.

Guerrero made his senior debut on 6 September 1992 aged 18, under Jupp Heynckes. He quickly made an impact and, although a midfielder, totalled 28 La Liga goals in his first two seasons (65 in six). He was awarded the &quot;New Spanish Player of the Year&quot; by &quot;El País&quot; in 1993, and won the &quot;Spanish Footballer of the Year&quot; by both &quot;Don Balón&quot; and &quot;El País&quot; the following year. In 1993–94 he scored a hat-trick against Albacete (4–1, home), adding four against Sporting de Gijón (7–0 also at the San Mamés Stadium); his arrival at the first team was met with unprecedented furor amongst the younger population due to both his footballing abilities and his charisma, and he became one of the first football celebrities as his pop-like figure boosted Athletic&#x27;s image overseas. He finished the campaign with 18 – fifth in the charts– and was named the side&#x27;s youngest-ever captain by Dragoslav Stepanović shortly after.

The early promise Guerrero showed attracted interest from, among others, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atlético Madrid, Juventus, Lazio and Manchester United. However, he remained loyal to Athletic and, in 1997, signed a ten-year contract which was the longest in the club&#x27;s history, and also made him the team&#x27;s highest-paid player.

In 1997–98, Guerrero netted eight times in 29 matches as the Basques finished second, leading to direct qualification for the UEFA Champions League where he put on strong performances in the group stage against Juventus and Galatasaray. Subsequently, however, his career went into decline and, in 2002, he was deemed surplus to requirements by coach Luis Fernández while still only 28; in his last four seasons he could only manage 57 games with just four goals but, despite his poor form, remained a fan favourite, and the decision to drop him caused some controversy.

Guerrero announced his retirement as a player at an emotional press conference on 11 July 2006. He scored 116 goals in 430 competitive matches over the course of 14 seasons, including four in 17 appearances in various European competitions, but did not win any major honours.

==International career==

On 27 January 1993, when still only 19, Guerrero made his debut for Spain in a friendly with Mexico, in Las Palmas. He went on to play 41 games and score 13 goals, and also represented the nation at the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World Cups and UEFA Euro 1996.

Among Guerrero&#x27;s personal international highlights were hat-tricks against Malta (3–0 in Attard, on 18 December 1996) and Cyprus (8–0, 8 September 1999). His last international took place in October 2000.

Guerrero also played 11 times for the Basque Country autonomous team between 1993 and 2006, scoring six goals – this included another hat-trick in 1997, against Yugoslavia. Both were records for some years, although Xabi Prieto went on to appear in more matches and Aritz Aduriz scored more goals.

==Style of play==
Often hailed as one of the greatest attacking midfielders of his generation, Guerrero was ambidextrous, and was renowned for his free kicks and finishing skills, derived from his sharp nose for goals. He was often referred to by the media as &quot;El Rey León&quot; (The Lion King) and &quot;La Perla de Lezama&quot; (The Pearl of Lezama).

==Coaching career==
Immediately after retiring, Guerrero took charge of the Lezama youth ranks, leaving the post after two years. He was subsequently in charge of Spain&#x27;s youths, working with the under-16s, under-15s and under-17s until his departure on 5 June 2023.

On 20 June 2024, Guerrero was appointed manager of Amorebieta, recently relegated to Primera Federación. On 29 October, with only one win in ten matches and with his team bottom of the table, he was dismissed.

==Personal life==
Guerrero&#x27;s younger brother, José Félix, was also a footballer and a midfielder. He also represented Athletic Bilbao, but only the reserves.

Julen also opened the &quot;Restaurante Julen Guerrero&quot; in Zamudio, and worked as an online columnist for Eurosport.

<doc id="339417" wikidata="Q5514059" url="?curid=339417" title="Symbolic artificial intelligence">
<text>In artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence (also known as classical artificial intelligence or logic-based artificial intelligence)
is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems), symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.

Symbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the mid-1990s. Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel&#x27;s Checkers Playing Program, led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the first AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969–1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988–2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition. Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning. Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant&#x27;s PAC learning, Quinlan&#x27;s ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.

Neural networks, a subsymbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and reemerged strongly in 2012. Early examples are Rosenblatt&#x27;s perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams, and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989. However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: &quot;Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn&#x27;t work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.&quot; Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.

== History ==

A short history of symbolic AI to the present day follows below. Time periods and titles are drawn from Henry Kautz&#x27;s 2020 AAAI Robert S. Engelmore Memorial Lecture and the longer Wikipedia article on the History of AI, with dates and titles differing slightly for increased clarity.

=== The first AI summer: irrational exuberance, 1948–1966 ===

Success at early attempts in AI occurred in three main areas: artificial neural networks, knowledge representation, and heuristic search, contributing to high expectations. This section summarizes Kautz&#x27;s reprise of early AI history.

====Approaches inspired by human or animal cognition or behavior====

Cybernetic approaches attempted to replicate the feedback loops between animals and their environments. A robotic turtle, with sensors, motors for driving and steering, and seven vacuum tubes for control, based on a preprogrammed neural net, was built as early as 1948. This work can be seen as an early precursor to later work in neural networks, reinforcement learning, and situated robotics.

An important early symbolic AI program was the Logic theorist, written by Allen Newell, Herbert Simon and Cliff Shaw in 1955–56, as it was able to prove 38 elementary theorems from Whitehead and Russell&#x27;s Principia Mathematica. Newell, Simon, and Shaw later generalized this work to create a domain-independent problem solver, GPS (General Problem Solver). GPS solved problems represented with formal operators via state-space search using means-ends analysis.

During the 1960s, symbolic approaches achieved great success at simulating intelligent behavior in structured environments such as game-playing, symbolic mathematics, and theorem-proving. AI research was concentrated in four institutions in the 1960s: Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford, MIT and (later) University of Edinburgh. Each one developed its own style of research. Earlier approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background.

Herbert Simon and Allen Newell studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as cognitive science, operations research and management science. Their research team used the results of psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at Carnegie Mellon University would eventually culminate in the development of the Soar architecture in the middle 1980s.

====Heuristic search====

In addition to the highly specialized domain-specific kinds of knowledge that we will see later used in expert systems, early symbolic AI researchers discovered another more general application of knowledge. These were called heuristics, rules of thumb that guide a search in promising directions: &quot;How can non-enumerative search be practical when the underlying problem is exponentially hard? The approach advocated by Simon and Newell is to employ heuristics: fast algorithms that may fail on some inputs or output suboptimal solutions.&quot; Another important advance was to find a way to apply these heuristics that guarantees a solution will be found, if there is one, not withstanding the occasional fallibility of heuristics: &quot;The A* algorithm provided a general frame for complete and optimal heuristically guided search. A* is used as a subroutine within practically every AI algorithm today but is still no magic bullet; its guarantee of completeness is bought at the cost of worst-case exponential time.

====Early work on knowledge representation and reasoning====

Early work covered both applications of formal reasoning emphasizing first-order logic, along with attempts to handle common-sense reasoning in a less formal manner.

===== Modeling formal reasoning with logic: the &quot;neats&quot; =====

Unlike Simon and Newell, John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate the exact mechanisms of human thought, but could instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem-solving with logic, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.
His laboratory at Stanford (SAIL) focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems, including knowledge representation, planning and learning.
Logic was also the focus of the work at the University of Edinburgh and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the science of logic programming.

===== Modeling implicit common-sense knowledge with frames and scripts: the &quot;scruffies&quot; =====
Researchers at MIT (such as Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert) found that solving difficult problems in vision and natural language processing required ad hoc solutions—they argued that no simple and general principle (like logic) would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. Roger Schank described their &quot;anti-logic&quot; approaches as &quot;scruffy&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;neat&quot; paradigms at CMU and Stanford).
Commonsense knowledge bases (such as Doug Lenat&#x27;s Cyc) are an example of &quot;scruffy&quot; AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.

=== The first AI winter: crushed dreams, 1967–1977 ===

The first AI winter was a shock:

=== The second AI summer: knowledge is power, 1978–1987 ===

==== Knowledge-based systems ====

As limitations with weak, domain-independent methods became more and more apparent, researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into AI applications. The knowledge revolution was driven by the realization that knowledge underlies high-performance, domain-specific AI applications.

Edward Feigenbaum said:
* &quot;In the knowledge lies the power.&quot; 
to describe that high performance in a specific domain requires both general and highly domain-specific knowledge. Ed Feigenbaum and Doug Lenat called this The Knowledge Principle: 
==== Success with expert systems ====
This &quot;knowledge revolution&quot; led to the development and deployment of expert systems (introduced by Edward Feigenbaum), the first commercially successful form of AI software.

Key expert systems were:

* DENDRAL, which found the structure of organic molecules from their chemical formula and mass spectrometer readings.
* MYCIN, which diagnosed bacteremia – and suggested further lab tests, when necessary – by interpreting lab results, patient history, and doctor observations. &quot;With about 450 rules, MYCIN was able to perform as well as some experts, and considerably better than junior doctors.&quot;
* INTERNIST and CADUCEUS which tackled internal medicine diagnosis. Internist attempted to capture the expertise of the chairman of internal medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine while CADUCEUS could eventually diagnose up to 1000 different diseases.
* GUIDON, which showed how a knowledge base built for expert problem solving could be repurposed for teaching.
* XCON, to configure VAX computers, a then laborious process that could take up to 90 days. XCON reduced the time to about 90 minutes.

DENDRAL is considered the first expert system that relied on knowledge-intensive problem-solving. It is described below, by Ed Feigenbaum, from a Communications of the ACM interview, Interview with Ed Feigenbaum:

The other expert systems mentioned above came after DENDRAL. MYCIN exemplifies the classic expert system architecture of a knowledge-base of rules coupled to a symbolic reasoning mechanism, including the use of certainty factors to handle uncertainty. GUIDON shows how an explicit knowledge base can be repurposed for a second application, tutoring, and is an example of an intelligent tutoring system, a particular kind of knowledge-based application. Clancey showed that it was not sufficient simply to use MYCIN&#x27;s rules for instruction, but that he also needed to add rules for dialogue management and student modeling. XCON is significant because of the millions of dollars it saved DEC, which triggered the expert system boom where most all major corporations in the US had expert systems groups, to capture corporate expertise, preserve it, and automate it:

Chess expert knowledge was encoded in Deep Blue. In 1996, this allowed IBM&#x27;s Deep Blue, with the help of symbolic AI, to win in a game of chess against the world champion at that time, Garry Kasparov.

===== Architecture of knowledge-based and expert systems =====

A key component of the system architecture for all expert systems is the knowledge base, which stores facts and rules for problem-solving.
The simplest approach for an expert system knowledge base is simply a collection or network of production rules. Production rules connect symbols in a relationship similar to an If-Then statement. The expert system processes the rules to make deductions and to determine what additional information it needs, i.e. what questions to ask, using human-readable symbols. For example, OPS5, CLIPS and their successors Jess and Drools operate in this fashion.

Expert systems can operate in either a forward chaining – from evidence to conclusions – or backward chaining – from goals to needed data and prerequisites – manner. More advanced knowledge-based systems, such as Soar can also perform meta-level reasoning, that is reasoning about their own reasoning in terms of deciding how to solve problems and monitoring the success of problem-solving strategies.

Blackboard systems are a second kind of knowledge-based or expert system architecture. They model a community of experts incrementally contributing, where they can, to solve a problem. The problem is represented in multiple levels of abstraction or alternate views. The experts (knowledge sources) volunteer their services whenever they recognize they can contribute. Potential problem-solving actions are represented on an agenda that is updated as the problem situation changes. A controller decides how useful each contribution is, and who should make the next problem-solving action. One example, the BB1 blackboard architecture was originally inspired by studies of how humans plan to perform multiple tasks in a trip. An innovation of BB1 was to apply the same blackboard model to solving its control problem, i.e., its controller performed meta-level reasoning with knowledge sources that monitored how well a plan or the problem-solving was proceeding and could switch from one strategy to another as conditions – such as goals or times – changed. BB1 has been applied in multiple domains: construction site planning, intelligent tutoring systems, and real-time patient monitoring.

=== The second AI winter, 1988–1993 ===

At the height of the AI boom, companies such as Symbolics, LMI, and Texas Instruments were selling LISP machines specifically targeted to accelerate the development of AI applications and research. In addition, several artificial intelligence companies, such as Teknowledge and Inference Corporation, were selling expert system shells, training, and consulting to corporations.

Unfortunately, the AI boom did not last and Kautz best describes the second AI winter that followed:
=== Adding in more rigorous foundations, 1993–2011 ===

==== Uncertain reasoning ====

Both statistical approaches and extensions to logic were tried.

One statistical approach, hidden Markov models, had already been popularized in the 1980s for speech recognition work. Subsequently, in 1988, Judea Pearl popularized the use of Bayesian Networks as a sound but efficient way of handling uncertain reasoning with his publication of the book Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of Plausible Inference. and Bayesian approaches were applied successfully in expert systems. Even later, in the 1990s, statistical relational learning, an approach that combines probability with logical formulas, allowed probability to be combined with first-order logic, e.g., with either Markov Logic Networks or Probabilistic Soft Logic.

Other, non-probabilistic extensions to first-order logic to support were also tried. For example, non-monotonic reasoning could be used with truth maintenance systems. A truth maintenance system tracked assumptions and justifications for all inferences. It allowed inferences to be withdrawn when assumptions were found out to be incorrect or a contradiction was derived. Explanations could be provided for an inference by explaining which rules were applied to create it and then continuing through underlying inferences and rules all the way back to root assumptions. Lofti Zadeh had introduced a different kind of extension to handle the representation of vagueness. For example, in deciding how &quot;heavy&quot; or &quot;tall&quot; a man is, there is frequently no clear &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer, and a predicate for heavy or tall would instead return values between 0 and 1. Those values represented to what degree the predicates were true. His fuzzy logic further provided a means for propagating combinations of these values through logical formulas.

==== Machine learning ====

Symbolic machine learning approaches were investigated to address the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. One of the earliest is Meta-DENDRAL. Meta-DENDRAL used a generate-and-test technique to generate plausible rule hypotheses to test against spectra. Domain and task knowledge reduced the number of candidates tested to a manageable size. Feigenbaum described Meta-DENDRAL as

In contrast to the knowledge-intensive approach of Meta-DENDRAL, Ross Quinlan invented a domain-independent approach to statistical classification, decision tree learning, starting first with ID3 and then later extending its capabilities to C4.5. The decision trees created are glass box, interpretable classifiers, with human-interpretable classification rules.

Advances were made in understanding machine learning theory, too. Tom Mitchell introduced version space learning which describes learning as a search through a space of hypotheses, with upper, more general, and lower, more specific, boundaries encompassing all viable hypotheses consistent with the examples seen so far. More formally, Valiant introduced Probably Approximately Correct Learning (PAC Learning), a framework for the mathematical analysis of machine learning.

Symbolic machine learning encompassed more than learning by example. E.g., John Anderson provided a cognitive model of human learning where skill practice results in a compilation of rules from a declarative format to a procedural format with his ACT-R cognitive architecture. For example, a student might learn to apply &quot;Supplementary angles are two angles whose measures sum 180 degrees&quot; as several different procedural rules. E.g., one rule might say that if X and Y are supplementary and you know X, then Y will be 180 - X. He called his approach &quot;knowledge compilation&quot;. ACT-R has been used successfully to model aspects of human cognition, such as learning and retention. ACT-R is also used in intelligent tutoring systems, called cognitive tutors, to successfully teach geometry, computer programming, and algebra to school children.

Inductive logic programming was another approach to learning that allowed logic programs to be synthesized from input-output examples. E.g., Ehud Shapiro&#x27;s MIS (Model Inference System) could synthesize Prolog programs from examples. John R. Koza applied genetic algorithms to program synthesis to create genetic programming, which he used to synthesize LISP programs. Finally, Zohar Manna and Richard Waldinger provided a more general approach to program synthesis that synthesizes a functional program in the course of proving its specifications to be correct.

As an alternative to logic, Roger Schank introduced case-based reasoning (CBR). The CBR approach outlined in his book, Dynamic Memory, focuses first on remembering key problem-solving cases for future use and generalizing them where appropriate. When faced with a new problem, CBR retrieves the most similar previous case and adapts it to the specifics of the current problem. Another alternative to logic, genetic algorithms and genetic programming are based on an evolutionary model of learning, where sets of rules are encoded into populations, the rules govern the behavior of individuals, and selection of the fittest prunes out sets of unsuitable rules over many generations.

Symbolic machine learning was applied to learning concepts, rules, heuristics, and problem-solving. Approaches, other than those above, include:
# Learning from instruction or advice—i.e., taking human instruction, posed as advice, and determining how to operationalize it in specific situations. For example, in a game of Hearts, learning &quot;exactly how&quot; to play a hand to &quot;avoid taking points.&quot;
# Learning from exemplars—improving performance by accepting subject-matter expert (SME) feedback during training. When problem-solving fails, querying the expert to either learn a new exemplar for problem-solving or to learn a new explanation as to exactly why one exemplar is more relevant than another. For example, the program Protos learned to diagnose tinnitus cases by interacting with an audiologist.
# Learning by analogy—constructing problem solutions based on similar problems seen in the past, and then modifying their solutions to fit a new situation or domain.
# Apprentice learning systems—learning novel solutions to problems by observing human problem-solving. Domain knowledge explains why novel solutions are correct and how the solution can be generalized. LEAP learned how to design VLSI circuits by observing human designers.
# Learning by discovery—i.e., creating tasks to carry out experiments and then learning from the results. Doug Lenat&#x27;s Eurisko, for example, learned heuristics to beat human players at the Traveller role-playing game for two years in a row.
# Learning macro-operators—i.e., searching for useful macro-operators to be learned from sequences of basic problem-solving actions. Good macro-operators simplify problem-solving by allowing problems to be solved at a more abstract level.

=== Deep learning and neuro-symbolic AI 2011–now ===

With the rise of deep learning, the symbolic AI approach has been compared to deep learning as complementary &quot;...with parallels having been drawn many times by AI researchers between Kahneman&#x27;s research on human reasoning and decision making – reflected in his book &quot;Thinking, Fast and Slow&quot; – and the so-called &quot;AI systems 1 and 2&quot;, which would in principle be modelled by deep learning and symbolic reasoning, respectively.&quot; In this view, symbolic reasoning is more apt for deliberative reasoning, planning, and explanation while deep learning is more apt for fast pattern recognition in perceptual applications with noisy data.

==== Neuro-symbolic AI: integrating neural and symbolic approaches ====

Neuro-symbolic AI attempts to integrate neural and symbolic architectures in a manner that addresses strengths and weaknesses of each, in a complementary fashion, in order to support robust AI capable of reasoning, learning, and cognitive modeling. As argued by Valiant and many others, the effective construction of rich computational cognitive models demands the combination of sound symbolic reasoning and efficient (machine) learning models. Gary Marcus, similarly, argues that: &quot;We cannot construct rich cognitive models in an adequate, automated way without the triumvirate of hybrid architecture, rich prior knowledge, and sophisticated techniques for reasoning.&quot;, and in particular:
&quot;To build a robust, knowledge-driven approach to AI we must have the machinery of symbol-manipulation in our toolkit. Too much of useful knowledge is abstract to make do without tools that represent and manipulate abstraction, and to date, the only machinery that we know of that can manipulate such abstract knowledge reliably is the apparatus of symbol manipulation.&quot;

Henry Kautz, Francesca Rossi, and Bart Selman have also argued for a synthesis. Their arguments are based on a need to address the two kinds of thinking discussed in Daniel Kahneman&#x27;s book, &quot;Thinking, Fast and Slow&quot;. Kahneman describes human thinking as having two components, System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast, automatic, intuitive and unconscious. System 2 is slower, step-by-step, and explicit. System 1 is the kind used for pattern recognition while System 2 is far better suited for planning, deduction, and deliberative thinking. In this view, deep learning best models the first kind of thinking while symbolic reasoning best models the second kind and both are needed.

Garcez and Lamb describe research in this area as being ongoing for at least the past twenty years, dating from their 2002 book on neurosymbolic learning systems. A series of workshops on neuro-symbolic reasoning has been held every year since 2005, see http://www.neural-symbolic.org/ for details.

In their 2015 paper, Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning: Contributions and Challenges, Garcez et al. argue that:
Approaches for integration are varied. Henry Kautz&#x27;s taxonomy of neuro-symbolic architectures, along with some examples, follows:
* Symbolic Neural symbolic—is the current approach of many neural models in natural language processing, where words or subword tokens are both the ultimate input and output of large language models. Examples include BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-3. 
* Symbolic[Neural]—is exemplified by AlphaGo, where symbolic techniques are used to call neural techniques. In this case the symbolic approach is Monte Carlo tree search and the neural techniques learn how to evaluate game positions.
* Neural|Symbolic—uses a neural architecture to interpret perceptual data as symbols and relationships that are then reasoned about symbolically.
* Neural:Symbolic → Neural—relies on symbolic reasoning to generate or label training data that is subsequently learned by a deep learning model, e.g., to train a neural model for symbolic computation by using a Macsyma-like symbolic mathematics system to create or label examples.
* Neural_{Symbolic}—uses a neural net that is generated from symbolic rules. An example is the Neural Theorem Prover, which constructs a neural network from an AND–OR proof tree generated from knowledge base rules and terms. Logic Tensor Networks also fall into this category.
* Neural[Symbolic]—allows a neural model to directly call a symbolic reasoning engine, e.g., to perform an action or evaluate a state.

Many key research questions remain, such as:
* What is the best way to integrate neural and symbolic architectures?
* How should symbolic structures be represented within neural networks and extracted from them?
* How should common-sense knowledge be learned and reasoned about?
* How can abstract knowledge that is hard to encode logically be handled?

== Techniques and contributions ==

This section provides an overview of techniques and contributions in an overall context leading to many other, more detailed articles in Wikipedia. Sections on Machine Learning and Uncertain Reasoning are covered earlier in the history section.

=== AI programming languages ===

The key AI programming language in the US during the last symbolic AI boom period was LISP. LISP is the second oldest programming language after FORTRAN and was created in 1958 by John McCarthy. LISP provided the first read-eval-print loop to support rapid program development. Compiled functions could be freely mixed with interpreted functions. Program tracing, stepping, and breakpoints were also provided, along with the ability to change values or functions and continue from breakpoints or errors. It had the first self-hosting compiler, meaning that the compiler itself was originally written in LISP and then ran interpretively to compile the compiler code.

Other key innovations pioneered by LISP that have spread to other programming languages include:
* Garbage collection
* Dynamic typing
* Higher-order functions
* Recursion
* Conditionals
Programs were themselves data structures that other programs could operate on, allowing the easy definition of higher-level languages.

In contrast to the US, in Europe the key AI programming language during that same period was Prolog. Prolog provided a built-in store of facts and clauses that could be queried by a read-eval-print loop. The store could act as a knowledge base and the clauses could act as rules or a restricted form of logic. As a subset of first-order logic Prolog was based on Horn clauses with a closed-world assumption—any facts not known were considered false—and a unique name assumption for primitive terms—e.g., the identifier barack_obama was considered to refer to exactly one object. Backtracking and unification are built-in to Prolog.

Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel are credited as the inventors of Prolog. Prolog is a form of logic programming, which was invented by Robert Kowalski. Its history was also influenced by Carl Hewitt&#x27;s PLANNER, an assertional database with pattern-directed invocation of methods. For more detail see the section on the origins of Prolog in the PLANNER article.

Prolog is also a kind of declarative programming. The logic clauses that describe programs are directly interpreted to run the programs specified. No explicit series of actions is required, as is the case with imperative programming languages.

Japan championed Prolog for its Fifth Generation Project, intending to build special hardware for high performance. Similarly, LISP machines were built to run LISP, but as the second AI boom turned to bust these companies could not compete with new workstations that could now run LISP or Prolog natively at comparable speeds. See the history section for more detail.

Smalltalk was another influential AI programming language. For example, it introduced metaclasses and, along with Flavors and CommonLoops, influenced the Common Lisp Object System, or (CLOS), that is now part of Common Lisp, the current standard Lisp dialect. CLOS is a Lisp-based object-oriented system that allows multiple inheritance, in addition to incremental extensions to both classes and metaclasses, thus providing a run-time meta-object protocol.

For other AI programming languages see this list of programming languages for artificial intelligence. Currently, Python, a multi-paradigm programming language, is the most popular programming language, partly due to its extensive package library that supports data science, natural language processing, and deep learning. Python includes a read-eval-print loop, functional elements such as higher-order functions, and object-oriented programming that includes metaclasses.

=== Search ===
Search arises in many kinds of problem solving, including planning, constraint satisfaction, and playing games such as checkers, chess, and go. The best known AI-search tree search algorithms are breadth-first search, depth-first search, A*, and Monte Carlo Search. Key search algorithms for Boolean satisfiability are WalkSAT, conflict-driven clause learning, and the DPLL algorithm. For adversarial search when playing games, alpha-beta pruning, branch and bound, and minimax were early contributions.

=== Knowledge representation and reasoning ===
Multiple different approaches to represent knowledge and then reason with those representations have been investigated. Below is a quick overview of approaches to knowledge representation and automated reasoning.

==== Knowledge representation ====
Semantic networks, conceptual graphs, frames, and logic are all approaches to modeling knowledge such as domain knowledge, problem-solving knowledge, and the semantic meaning of language. Ontologies model key concepts and their relationships in a domain. Example ontologies are YAGO, WordNet, and DOLCE. DOLCE is an example of an upper ontology that can be used for any domain while WordNet is a lexical resource that can also be viewed as an ontology. YAGO incorporates WordNet as part of its ontology, to align facts extracted from Wikipedia with WordNet synsets. The Disease Ontology is an example of a medical ontology currently being used.

Description logic is a logic for automated classification of ontologies and for detecting inconsistent classification data. OWL is a language used to represent ontologies with description logic. Protégé is an ontology editor that can read in OWL ontologies and then check consistency with deductive classifiers such as such as HermiT.

First-order logic is more general than description logic. The automated theorem provers discussed below can prove theorems in first-order logic. Horn clause logic is more restricted than first-order logic and is used in logic programming languages such as Prolog. Extensions to first-order logic include temporal logic, to handle time; epistemic logic, to reason about agent knowledge; modal logic, to handle possibility and necessity; and probabilistic logics to handle logic and probability together.

==== Automatic theorem proving ====
Examples of automated theorem provers for first-order logic are:
* Prover9
* ACL2
* Vampire
Prover9 can be used in conjunction with the Mace4 model checker. ACL2 is a theorem prover that can handle proofs by induction and is a descendant of the Boyer-Moore Theorem Prover, also known as Nqthm.

==== Reasoning in knowledge-based systems ====
Knowledge-based systems have an explicit knowledge base, typically of rules, to enhance reusability across domains by separating procedural code and domain knowledge. A separate inference engine processes rules and adds, deletes, or modifies a knowledge store.

Forward chaining inference engines are the most common, and are seen in CLIPS and OPS5. Backward chaining occurs in Prolog, where a more limited logical representation is used, Horn Clauses. Pattern-matching, specifically unification, is used in Prolog.

A more flexible kind of problem-solving occurs when reasoning about what to do next occurs, rather than simply choosing one of the available actions. This kind of meta-level reasoning is used in Soar and in the BB1 blackboard architecture.

Cognitive architectures such as ACT-R may have additional capabilities, such as the ability to compile frequently used knowledge into higher-level chunks.

==== Commonsense reasoning ====
Marvin Minsky first proposed frames as a way of interpreting common visual situations, such as an office, and Roger Schank extended this idea to scripts for common routines, such as dining out. Cyc has attempted to capture useful common-sense knowledge and has &quot;micro-theories&quot; to handle particular kinds of domain-specific reasoning.

Qualitative simulation, such as Benjamin Kuipers&#x27;s QSIM, approximates human reasoning about naive physics, such as what happens when we heat a liquid in a pot on the stove. We expect it to heat and possibly boil over, even though we may not know its temperature, its boiling point, or other details, such as atmospheric pressure.

Similarly, Allen&#x27;s temporal interval algebra is a simplification of reasoning about time and Region Connection Calculus is a simplification of reasoning about spatial relationships. Both can be solved with constraint solvers.

==== Constraints and constraint-based reasoning ====
Constraint solvers perform a more limited kind of inference than first-order logic. They can simplify sets of spatiotemporal constraints, such as those for RCC or Temporal Algebra, along with solving other kinds of puzzle problems, such as Wordle, Sudoku, cryptarithmetic problems, and so on. Constraint logic programming can be used to solve scheduling problems, for example with constraint handling rules (CHR).

=== Automated planning ===
The General Problem Solver (GPS) cast planning as problem-solving used means-ends analysis to create plans. STRIPS took a different approach, viewing planning as theorem proving. Graphplan takes a least-commitment approach to planning, rather than sequentially choosing actions from an initial state, working forwards, or a goal state if working backwards. Satplan is an approach to planning where a planning problem is reduced to a Boolean satisfiability problem.

=== Natural language processing ===
Natural language processing focuses on treating language as data to perform tasks such as identifying topics without necessarily understanding the intended meaning. Natural language understanding, in contrast, constructs a meaning representation and uses that for further processing, such as answering questions.

Parsing, tokenizing, spelling correction, part-of-speech tagging, noun and verb phrase chunking are all aspects of natural language processing long handled by symbolic AI, but since improved by deep learning approaches. In symbolic AI, discourse representation theory and first-order logic have been used to represent sentence meanings. Latent semantic analysis (LSA) and explicit semantic analysis also provided vector representations of documents. In the latter case, vector components are interpretable as concepts named by Wikipedia articles.

New deep learning approaches based on Transformer models have now eclipsed these earlier symbolic AI approaches and attained state-of-the-art performance in natural language &quot;processing&quot;. However, Transformer models are opaque and do not yet produce human-interpretable semantic representations for sentences and documents. Instead, they produce task-specific vectors where the meaning of the vector components is opaque.

=== Agents and multi-agent systems ===
Agents are autonomous systems embedded in an environment they perceive and act upon in some sense. Russell and Norvig&#x27;s standard textbook on artificial intelligence is organized to reflect agent architectures of increasing sophistication. The sophistication of agents varies from simple reactive agents, to those with a model of the world and automated planning capabilities, possibly a BDI agent, i.e., one with beliefs, desires, and intentions – or alternatively a reinforcement learning model learned over time to choose actions – up to a combination of alternative architectures, such as a neuro-symbolic architecture that includes deep learning for perception.

In contrast, a multi-agent system consists of multiple agents that communicate amongst themselves with some inter-agent communication language such as Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML). The agents need not all have the same internal architecture. Advantages of multi-agent systems include the ability to divide work among the agents and to increase fault tolerance when agents are lost. Research problems include how agents reach consensus, distributed problem solving, multi-agent learning, multi-agent planning, and distributed constraint optimization.

== Controversies ==

Controversies arose from early on in symbolic AI, both within the field—e.g., between logicists (the pro-logic &quot;neats&quot;) and non-logicists (the anti-logic &quot;scruffies&quot;)—and between those who embraced AI but rejected symbolic approaches—primarily connectionists—and those outside the field. Critiques from outside of the field were primarily from philosophers, on intellectual grounds, but also from funding agencies, especially during the two AI winters.

=== The Frame Problem: knowledge representation challenges for first-order logic ===

Limitations were discovered in using simple first-order logic to reason about dynamic domains. Problems were discovered both with regards to enumerating the preconditions for an action to succeed and in providing axioms for what did not change after an action was performed.

McCarthy and Hayes introduced the Frame Problem in 1969 in the paper, &quot;Some Philosophical Problems from the Standpoint of Artificial Intelligence.&quot; A simple example occurs in &quot;proving that one person could get into conversation with another&quot;, as an axiom asserting &quot;if a person has a telephone he still has it after looking up a number in the telephone book&quot; would be required for the deduction to succeed. Similar axioms would be required for other domain actions to specify what &quot;did not&quot; change.

A similar problem, called the Qualification Problem, occurs in trying to enumerate the &quot;preconditions&quot; for an action to succeed. An infinite number of pathological conditions can be imagined, e.g., a banana in a tailpipe could prevent a car from operating correctly.

McCarthy&#x27;s approach to fix the frame problem was circumscription, a kind of non-monotonic logic where deductions could be made from actions that need only specify what would change while not having to explicitly specify everything that would not change. Other non-monotonic logics provided truth maintenance systems that revised beliefs leading to contradictions.

Other ways of handling more open-ended domains included probabilistic reasoning systems and machine learning to learn new concepts and rules. McCarthy&#x27;s Advice Taker can be viewed as an inspiration here, as it could incorporate new knowledge provided by a human in the form of assertions or rules. For example, experimental symbolic machine learning systems explored the ability to take high-level natural language advice and to interpret it into domain-specific actionable rules.

Similar to the problems in handling dynamic domains, common-sense reasoning is also difficult to capture in formal reasoning. Examples of common-sense reasoning include implicit reasoning about how people think or general knowledge of day-to-day events, objects, and living creatures. This kind of knowledge is taken for granted and not viewed as noteworthy. Common-sense reasoning is an open area of research and challenging both for symbolic systems (e.g., Cyc has attempted to capture key parts of this knowledge over more than a decade) and neural systems (e.g., self-driving cars that do not know not to drive into cones or not to hit pedestrians walking a bicycle).

McCarthy viewed his Advice Taker as having common-sense, but his definition of common-sense was different than the one above. He defined a program as having common sense &quot;&quot;if it automatically deduces for itself a sufficiently wide class of immediate consequences of anything it is told and what it already knows&quot;.&quot;

=== Connectionist AI: philosophical challenges and sociological conflicts ===
Connectionist approaches include earlier work on neural networks, such as perceptrons; work in the mid to late 80s, such as Danny Hillis&#x27;s Connection Machine and Yann LeCun&#x27;s advances in convolutional neural networks; to today&#x27;s more advanced approaches, such as Transformers, GANs, and other work in deep learning.

Three philosophical positions have been outlined among connectionists:

# Implementationism—where connectionist architectures implement the capabilities for symbolic processing,
# Radical connectionism—where symbolic processing is rejected totally, and connectionist architectures underlie intelligence and are fully sufficient to explain it,
# Moderate connectionism—where symbolic processing and connectionist architectures are viewed as complementary and both are required for intelligence.

Olazaran, in his sociological history of the controversies within the neural network community, described the moderate connectionism view as essentially compatible with current research in neuro-symbolic hybrids:
The third and last position I would like to examine here is what I call the moderate connectionist view, a more eclectic view of the current debate between connectionism and symbolic AI. One of the researchers who has elaborated this position most explicitly is Andy Clark, a philosopher from the School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences of the University of Sussex (Brighton, England). Clark defended hybrid (partly symbolic, partly connectionist) systems. He claimed that (at least) two kinds of theories are needed in order to study and model cognition. On the one hand, for some information-processing tasks (such as pattern recognition) connectionism has advantages over symbolic models. But on the other hand, for other cognitive processes (such as serial, deductive reasoning, and generative symbol manipulation processes) the symbolic paradigm offers adequate models, and not only &quot;approximations&quot; (contrary to what radical connectionists would claim).

Gary Marcus has claimed that the animus in the deep learning community against symbolic approaches now may be more sociological than philosophical:To think that we can simply abandon symbol-manipulation is to suspend disbelief.

And yet, for the most part, that&#x27;s how most current AI proceeds. Hinton and many others have tried hard to banish symbols altogether. The deep learning hope—seemingly grounded not so much in science, but in a sort of historical grudge—is that intelligent behavior will emerge purely from the confluence of massive data and deep learning. Where classical computers and software solve tasks by defining sets of symbol-manipulating rules dedicated to particular jobs, such as editing a line in a word processor or performing a calculation in a spreadsheet, neural networks typically try to solve tasks by statistical approximation and learning from examples.According to Marcus, Geoffrey Hinton and his colleagues have been vehemently &quot;anti-symbolic&quot;:When deep learning reemerged in 2012, it was with a kind of take-no-prisoners attitude that has characterized most of the last decade. By 2015, his hostility toward all things symbols had fully crystallized. He gave a talk at an AI workshop at Stanford comparing symbols to aether, one of science&#x27;s greatest mistakes.

Since then, his anti-symbolic campaign has only increased in intensity. In 2016, Yann LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton wrote a manifesto for deep learning in one of science&#x27;s most important journals, Nature. It closed with a direct attack on symbol manipulation, calling not for reconciliation but for outright replacement. Later, Hinton told a gathering of European Union leaders that investing any further money in symbol-manipulating approaches was &quot;a huge mistake,&quot; likening it to investing in internal combustion engines in the era of electric cars.

Part of these disputes may be due to unclear terminology: 
Turing award winner Judea Pearl offers a critique of machine learning which, unfortunately, conflates the terms machine learning and deep learning. Similarly, when Geoffrey Hinton refers to symbolic AI, the connotation of the term tends to be that of expert systems dispossessed of any ability to learn. The use of the terminology is in need of clarification. Machine learning is not confined to association rule mining, c.f. the body of work on symbolic ML and relational learning (the differences to deep learning being the choice of representation, localist logical rather than distributed, and the non-use of gradient-based learning algorithms). Equally, symbolic AI is not just about production rules written by hand. A proper definition of AI concerns knowledge representation and reasoning, autonomous multi-agent systems, planning and argumentation, as well as learning.

=== Situated robotics: the world as a model ===

Another critique of symbolic AI is the embodied cognition approach:
Rodney Brooks invented behavior-based robotics, one approach to embodied cognition. Nouvelle AI, another name for this approach, is viewed as an alternative to &quot;both&quot; symbolic AI and connectionist AI. His approach rejected representations, either symbolic or distributed, as not only unnecessary, but as detrimental. Instead, he created the subsumption architecture, a layered architecture for embodied agents. Each layer achieves a different purpose and must function in the real world. For example, the first robot he describes in &quot;Intelligence Without Representation&quot;, has three layers. The bottom layer interprets sonar sensors to avoid objects. The middle layer causes the robot to wander around when there are no obstacles. The top layer causes the robot to go to more distant places for further exploration. Each layer can temporarily inhibit or suppress a lower-level layer. He criticized AI researchers for defining AI problems for their systems, when: &quot;There is no clean division between perception (abstraction) and reasoning in the real world.&quot; He called his robots &quot;Creatures&quot; and each layer was &quot;composed of a fixed-topology network of simple finite state machines.&quot; In the Nouvelle AI approach, &quot;First, it is vitally important to test the Creatures we build in the real world; i.e., in the same world that we humans inhabit. It is disastrous to fall into the temptation of testing them in a simplified world first, even with the best intentions of later transferring activity to an unsimplified world.&quot; His emphasis on real-world testing was in contrast to &quot;Early work in AI concentrated on games, geometrical problems, symbolic algebra, theorem proving, and other formal systems&quot; and the use of the blocks world in symbolic AI systems such as SHRDLU.

=== Current views ===
Each approach—symbolic, connectionist, and behavior-based—has advantages, but has been criticized by the other approaches. Symbolic AI has been criticized as disembodied, liable to the qualification problem, and poor in handling the perceptual problems where deep learning excels. In turn, connectionist AI has been criticized as poorly suited for deliberative step-by-step problem solving, incorporating knowledge, and handling planning. Finally, Nouvelle AI excels in reactive and real-world robotics domains but has been criticized for difficulties in incorporating learning and knowledge.

Hybrid AIs incorporating one or more of these approaches are currently viewed as the path forward. Russell and Norvig conclude that:Overall, Dreyfus saw areas where AI did not have complete answers and said that Al is therefore impossible; we now see many of these same areas undergoing continued research and development leading to increased capability, not impossibility.

<doc id="339421" wikidata="Q495348" url="?curid=339421" title="Culture of South Korea">
<text>The contemporary culture of South Korea developed from the traditional culture of Korea which was prevalent in the early Korean nomadic tribes. By maintaining thousands of years of ancient Korean culture, with influence from ancient Chinese culture, South Korea split on its own path of cultural development away from North Korean culture since the division of Korea in 1945. The industrialization, urbanization and westernization of South Korea, especially Seoul, have brought many changes to the way Korean people live. Changing economics and lifestyles have led to urbanization—a concentration of population in major cities (and depopulation of the rural countryside), with multi-generational households separating into nuclear family living arrangements. Today, many cultural elements from South Korea, especially popular culture, have spread across the globe and have become some of the most prominent cultural forces in the world.

==Literature==
Prior to the 20th century, Korean literature was influenced by Classical Chinese literature. Chinese calligraphy was also extensively used by Koreans for over one thousand years in Korean literature. Modern literature is often linked with the development of Hangul, which was created by the fourth king of Joseon Sejong the Great and promulgated in the text &quot;Hunminjeongeum&quot;. The publication of the Korean alphabet in 1443 was a surprise to many as there are no records of King Sejong working on it, concluding that the king was doing it in secret. This move was initially made to help spread literacy from the dominant scholarly-official class, the &quot;yangban&quot;, to the common people— including women. Before the creation of Hangul, the common text being read was Hanja, which are Chinese characters; only those from wealthy families who could afford an education were able to learn it. Furthermore, like any other language, Hanja was not able to capture the entire meaning of words that were spoken in Korean, so it was hard to decipher what citizens were attempting to say. Hangul, however, only reached a dominant position in Korean literature in the second half of the 19th century, resulting in a major growth in Korean literature.

In modern poetry, there were attempts at introducing imagist and modern poetry methods particularly in translations of early American moderns such as Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot in the early 20th century. In the early Republic period, patriotic works were very successful.

Lyric poetry dominated from the 1970s onwards. Poetry is quite popular in contemporary South Korea, both in terms of number of works published and lay writing.

==Journalism==


South Korea has 10 main newspapers and 4 main broadcasters. Top daily newspapers are &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot;, &quot;JoongAng Ilbo&quot;, and &quot;The Dong-A Ilbo&quot;. &quot;The Hankyoreh&quot; is a left-leaning newspaper. KBS, MBC, SBS, and YTN are the main TV channels, and EBS is used for student and adult education.

Other magazines are &quot;K Scene Magazine&quot;, &quot;JoongAng Ilbo&quot;, Yonhap News Agency, and &quot;OhmyNews&quot;. &quot;The Korea Times&quot;, &quot;The Korea Herald&quot;, and &quot;PRKorea Times&quot; are English language newspapers for foreigners.

== Foreign influences ==
South Korea has for almost a millennium been significantly influenced by China as well as by various neighboring Asian countries to a lesser extent. In recent years, there has been some influence by the Western world, mostly in food. This has changed peoples&#x27; eating habits as well; many people now also eat Western and other Asian foods in addition to traditional Korean food. Pizza is one of the favorite foreign foods among South Koreans, though it tends to differ from the pizza served in the west with an Asian tinge, often featuring corn, sweet potato, mayonnaise, bulgogi and various other ingredients. Many hamburger, fried chicken, coffee, and ice cream chains are also very popular in South Korea. While tea remains a highly popular traditional drink, Coffeehouses operated by 12 major brands increased to up to 2,000 locations in 2010, and the term &quot;coffice&quot; ( 커피스) was coined to describe using a cafe as an office.

Japanese pop culture was banned for decades in South Korea (though not effectively) reaching Korea by way of satellite television channels and youth culture films and magazines. Back in the year 2000, South Korean youth were reading manga, listening to Japanese rock and rap, and fashion in Korea shared similarities with Japanese street fashion trends from Harajuku and Roppongi. The ban on Japanese pop culture imports was lifted in 2000.

== Traditional culture ==
=== Pansori ===

Pansori is a form of traditional musical art within Korea that dates back to the Joseon dynasty (1392–1897), &quot;pan&quot; meaning an open space where individuals come to gather and &quot;sori&quot; meaning sound. Pansori performances consist of a singer and a drummer, the singer sings out the story using special techniques that require years of training, and the drummer producing beats to help the story flow and also to support the singer. Members of the audience are also encouraged to take part in the performance and support the singer.

The purpose of Pansori was to tell tales and stories to individuals who would take the time to listen since most stories range from three hours to eight or nine hours from start to finish. There are five traditional stories that are performed for audiences, but since pansori is mostly orally transmitted, there have been many stories lost throughout history. Each story contains a theme, whether it be about filial piety, love, or the sorrows of individuals releasing their &quot;han&quot;. &quot;Han&quot; is an emotion within a person that is negative and usually is tied with grieving, regret, or resentment.

=== Chuseok ===

Chuseok, also known as Hangawi, comes from the agrarian era of Korean society, and is considered one of the biggest holidays for the Korean people. Historians believe Chuseok originated 2000 years ago, and was originally a festival that held a weaving competition. Chuseok is recognized as a public holiday, which allows for work to be suspended until the celebration is over.

The holiday is held on the 15th day of the 8th month of the Lunar calendar. It is a celebration of the Korean peoples&#x27; ancestors and is used as a time to give thanks for a good farming season. Chuseok lasts for 3 days, and it is a time spent with family to eat tradition food and play tradition games. Songpyeon is traditionally eaten during this time, and is a rice cake that contains a filling.

=== Seollal ===

Seollal, also known as the Korean New Year, is a holiday that marks the start of a new year on the Lunar calendar. The Korean New Year typically falls sometime in January or February. It is believed that Seollal originates from the 3rd century. Evidence of the first Korean New Year can be found in a document titled Samguk yusa. During the Japanese colonization of Korea, Seollal was prohibited from being celebrated, but then became an official holiday sometime between 1945 and 1950. Seollal is now recognized as a public holiday, and work is suspended until the holiday has ended.

Seollal is a time for family members to honor their ancestors and spend quality time together. Korean ancestors are honored during this time through special rituals, and families get the opportunity to enjoy games and food together. It is very common for Korean people to celebrate Seollal by playing a game of Yut Nori. Tteokguk, or rice cake soup, is typically eaten during Seollal, and it is believed that one will turn a year older after eating the soup.

==Architecture==
Korean architecture is characterized by naturalistic tendencies, simplicity, and economic feasibility of forms. Sharp angles, strong lines, steep planes, and brilliant colors are all avoided. It typically creates a quiet atmosphere.

==Technology==

===Cellular phones===
An estimated 98% of South Koreans own mobile phones and use them not only for calling and messaging but also for watching live TV, viewing websites and keeping track of their online gaming statuses. South Korean corporations include Samsung and LG.

Many South Korean phones feature TV broadcasting through Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB), which now carries seven TV channels. Over one million DMB phones have been sold, and providers like KT and SK Telecom have provided coverage throughout many parts of major cities.

South Korea won the LG Mobile World Cup, a texting competition run by LG Electronics.

==Video games==
===Online games===
Korea has many e-sports athletes. As perceptions of games have changed, the Korean game market has grown in size and popularized. Korean companies are expected to spur the mobile e-sports industry, or m-sports.

===History===
Video games in South Korea have been growing in popularity since the mid-1980s, however it was not until the early 2000s that their popularity skyrocketed. Their sudden growth was due to immensely popular games, such as &quot;Starcraft 2&quot;, &quot;League Of Legends&quot;, and &quot;Lineage II&quot;. Since then, the Gaming industry in South Korea has been steadily growing every year. Its projected market revenue for 2018 is US$10.5 billion.

===Growth in popularity===
The introduction of those games in the early 2000s, as well as the introduction of several new international tournaments, like The World Cyber Games, Electronic Sports World Cup, and Major League Gaming, have allowed the video game industry to grow at a much faster rate. In these tournaments, competitive games would be played for large prizes, some being as much as US$1 million. The tournaments are very popular in South Korea, and attract a large viewership. Researchers have estimated that the eSports industry will reach US$1 billion in revenue by 2019.

===PC bangs===
Video games are very popular in South Korea, but not everyone is able to afford the gaming PCs necessary to play popular games. These high upfront costs have led to the growth of the &quot;PC bang&quot; industry. Translated as &quot;PC room&quot;, PC bangs are public cafés that let customers play popular PC games on powerful, high-end computers at a low cost per hour. There are currently around 25,000 PC bangs in South Korea alone, with hourly rates that ranged from $0.44 to $1.30 per hour .
The success of this low-cost model has led to the rise of PC bangs as a popular hangout spot among students, and they generally serve as a place to meet people with similar gaming interests.

===Addiction===
As video gaming is becoming much more popular in South Korea, it also bring up worries of the welfare of the nation&#x27;s youth. Video game addiction has been a concerning issue with in the South Korean government. Considerable amounts of funds have been invested into programs and campaigns to reduce this issue. One action that the government imposed was the &quot;Shutdown Law&quot;. This law prevents anyone aged under 16 from playing online from times 10pm until 6am.

===Popular media===
&quot;StarCraft&quot;, the PC real-time strategy game, was the most popular televised game in Korea. Games are often broadcast on TV stations such as MBCGame and Ongamenet. These tournaments are usually broadcast live and have sizable crowds while they are recorded at shopping malls like COEX, in southeast Seoul. Professional StarCraft players can command considerable salaries in Korea, and are usually noted celebrities, such as Lim &quot;BoxeR&quot; Yo-Hwan. In recent years, professional video gaming in South Korea has branched out away from just Starcraft into a variety of different titles, including &quot;Dota 2&quot;, &quot;League of Legends&quot;, &quot;Starcraft 2&quot;, &quot;Battle Ground&quot;, and &quot;Overwatch&quot;.

== South Korean food and food culture ==

Korean food, or hansik, is characterized by a clear distinction between the main dish (rice, noodles, etc.) and the side dish (called banchan), diverse recipes, a balanced mix of animal and plant products, and fermented foods. The Korean people have also believed that food and medicine share the same origin, following the adage that &quot;food is the best medicine.&quot;

Fermented foods are the core of Korean cooking. These foods are mostly referred to as &quot;chang&quot;. This includes soy sauce (ganjang). soybean paste (doenjang), red chilli soybean paste (gochujang). Green onion, garlic, and red chilli are also the foundations Korean cooking.

Kimchi is one of South Korea&#x27;s staple foods, normally eaten as a side dish. A meal consisting of steamed rice with one to three side dishes (such as kimchi, more specifically baechan (cabbage)) is common. Kimchi has its own fermented taste not just because of its health functionalities due to its ingredients but also by fermentation products that contribute taste, texture, quality, and health functionality, owing to its special fermentation process.

Sundubu-jjigae is a spicy Korean tofu stew. Unlike typical stews, it is not thick and heavy. It has a deep umami flavor, seasoned with fish sauce, garlic, scallions and mushrooms.

Bibimbap is a rice-based dish with various colorful vegetables and eggs, which are mixed with the addition of &quot;gochujang&quot; (red chili paste), making its texture very different from what it was in the beginning. Although bibimbap is usually served with meat, many Korean&#x27;s eat bibimbap with only eggs as the source of protein in the simple rice dish.

Tteokbokki (Korean rice cake dish) is a popular dish (street food) in South Korea. Historically, tteokbokki was considered a refined food that was eaten by nobles and members of the royal court. But in the wake of the Korean War in the 1950s, it transformed into a different kind of dish, made by boiling wheat flour cakes with fish cakes and vegetables in a red pepper sauce mixture. By the 1970s, it had become the people&#x27;s snack, enjoyed by people from all walks of life.

Budae-jjigae is a popular stew originating from the Korean War. The base is similar to many traditional spicy Korean stews like soondubu or kimchi jjigae, which are usually made of anchovies, seaweed, and gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) steeped together. But its other ingredients set budae jjigae apart from its counterparts. The stew includes spam, baked beans, hotdogs, and ramen noodles with green onions garnished on top.

==Influence of military culture to society in contemporary period==
In contemporary period, military cultural elements have a great influence on South Korea&#x27;s civilian sector. Because President Park Chung-hee, who served in the military of Manchukuo, a puppet state of the Empire of Japan, transplanted the Japanese military&#x27;s bad habits and military culture throughout South Korean society, and many remnants of this remain even after democratization was achieved in 1987.

The remnants of military cultural elements and bad habits from the military dictatorship that still remain today are :

* Age hierarchy — In South Korea, no matter how small the age difference is, if the year of birth is not the same, the hierarchy is determined as &quot;Hyeong&quot; (형), &quot;Oppa&quot; (오빠) (both meaning &quot;older brother&quot;), &quot;Nuna&quot; (누나), &quot;Eonni&quot; (언니) (both meaning &quot;older sister&quot;), &quot;Dongsaeng&quot; (동생, meaning &quot;younger brother/sister&quot;), and they are not regarded as mutual friends. Even, unless the relationship is very close, the person who is at least one year younger than the other person must use linguistic honorifics. Until the Joseon dynasty era, unlike today, on the Korean Peninsula, age was not considered as severe, so it was a culture of making friends within a small age gap. This is why the age hierarchy in South Korea is a remnant of the era of South Korea&#x27;s military dictatorship. Therefore, unlike other countries (expect North Korea), it is common in South Korea to frequently ask people about their age.

* Middle school, High school, University, and Work culture — In South Korea, military culture has an impact on social life, including middle and high schools, universities, and workplaces. As a representative example, in middle and high schools, there is one thing where students are asked to form a military-style line. When living in society, there are bosses who force military-style language at work. In fact, the South Korean military has already abolished this military-style language.
==Drinking games==

In the drinking culture of South Korea often with a group of individuals, drinking games are played. These games begin during university orientation and continue to be played throughout life. A variety of games can be played within the group and can change with every coming round. The type of alcohol can vary, but more than likely soju, a common Korean liquor, is used when the games are being played. Sometimes people mix soju and beer and call it &quot;So-Maek,&quot; so for soju, and Maek for beer, since beer is called &quot;Maek-joo&quot; in Korean.

==Popular culture==
===K-pop music===

Many Korean pop stars and groups are known throughout East and Southeast Asia. K-pop often features young performers. In the 1970s and 1980s, many musicians appeared, such as Cho Yong Pil, a renowned musician from that period. He used many sources such as the synthesizer. Among his influence, he is well known for popularizing rock music. The popularization of Korean pop music has come from many sources including, YouTube and other video streaming sources. With the growth of social media, it has helped with the expansion of K-pop outside of Asia. The dominant explanation of the global K-pop phenomenon is the &quot;hybrid&quot; view that advances an argument about the combined along with Korean, the Austronesian, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian cultures as a grand Asian Culture (AC) that increasingly countervails the previously dominant Western Culture (WC) as a whole (Chua, 2004). K-pop became one of Korea&#x27;s top exporting industries with its rapid and widespread popularity around the world, particularly in the East. Korean popular culture has a timely commercial combination of (1) the global liberalization of music markets in Asia and more recently the rest of the world; and (2) the rapid advancement of digital technologies like YouTube which prefers to select and feature perfectly photogenic performers from all over the world, including Korean girl and boy bands (Oh, 391).

The emergence of the group Seo Taiji and Boys in 1992 marked a turning point for Korean popular music by incorporating elements of American popular musical genres of the 1990s. To illustrate, their popularity was based on innovative hybridization of music as they creatively mixed the genres like rap, soul, rock and roll, techno, punk, hardcore and even ppongjjak, and invented a unique musical form which &#x27;employs rap only during the verses, singing choruses in a pop style&#x27; with dynamic dance movements. They showed how Korean rap would sound. Consequently, Seo Taiji and Boys expanded the scope of K-pop.

In 2002, BoA became the first Korean pop star to break through in Japan following the fall of barriers that had restricted the import and export of entertainment between the countries since the end of World War II. For that reason, she was awarded the title of Goodwill Ambassador, and has since contributed to restoring the good relations between Japan and South Korea.

In addition, there is also traditional Korean pop music, or trot. Appealing to older Koreans, there are many popular singers, including Tae Jin Ah, Na Hoon-a and Song Dae Kwan, mainly in their 50s and 60s, if not older. However, trot has recently experienced a resurgence due to the popularity of Jang Yoon Jeong, a young semi-trot star, who had a breakout hit with &quot;Omona.&quot;

===Noraebang===
Karaoke, a Japanese loan word, is most commonly called &quot;Noraebang&quot; (노래방, literally, &quot;song room&quot;) in Korea instead but various Korean alternatives like &quot;Norae yeonseupjang&quot; (), or &quot;Norae yeonseupshil&quot; () are also sometimes used. &quot;Noraebang&quot; is even conducted in transport vehicles such as tourist buses. Noraebang is the equivalent to the &quot;Karaoke-Box&quot; in Japan, whereas singing before an audience of a karaoke bar is called Karaoke () in Korea. Recently, a coin karaoke, which is a form of payment different from the existing karaoke, appeared.

=== Korean popular culture outside Korea ===
There are approximately 70,000 Korean students in American colleges every year. Furthermore, increased immigration has reached to booming heights of over a million in 2010 alone. With these migrations have come the spread and expansion of Korean Popular culture. For example, the popular South Korean film titled &quot;Shiri&quot; () sold more than 5.78 million movie tickets in the United States alone.

One of the reasons for the success of the Korean Wave comes from the influence that the Korean government has in the production and distribution of popular culture. Recent years have led to changes in access to both enjoying and creating new songs, movies, and other types of popular culture. One example comes from recent collaboration with the Korean Government and others to help achieve glocalization, making hallyu approachable and enjoyable for people from many different cultures and backgrounds.

===Film and television===
The popularity of Korean films has risen since the success of &quot;Shiri&quot; in 1999. South Korea is one of the few countries where Hollywood productions do not enjoy a dominant share of the domestic market, partly due to screen quotas requiring cinemas to show Korean films at least 73 days a year.

&quot;Shiri&quot;, a film about a North Korean spy preparing a coup in Seoul, was the first in Korean history to sell more than two million tickets in Seoul alone. It also earned $14 million at the Japanese box office alone, helping it to surpass box office hits such as &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The success of &quot;Shiri&quot; motivated other Korean films with larger budgets. Upon release, &quot;Shiri&quot; attracted 5.8 million theatre-goers; these numbers outscored the local theater attendance for the Hollywood-made film, &quot;Titanic&quot;. The venture capital firm KDB Capital, the main firm that invested money into the production of &quot;Shiri&quot; (specifically, around $333,000), would end up earning more than 300 percent in returns (Shim, 33), helping to spark the Korean government&#x27;s interest in the possible profits that can be awarded through the entertainment industry.

In 2000 &quot;Joint Security Area&quot; achieved huge success, surpassing the benchmark set by &quot;Shiri&quot;. The following saw &quot;Friend&quot; manage the same. In 2001, the romantic comedy &quot;My Sassy Girl&quot; outsold &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter&quot; which ran at the same time. Park Chan-wook, the director of &quot;Joint Security Area&quot;, has gone on to direct many popular films in Korea and abroad, and is best known for &quot;Oldboy&quot;. Kim Ki-Duk, another well-respected filmmaker who is noted for using minimal dialogue to create an emotional response from the audience, is known especially for &quot;3-Iron&quot; and &quot;Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring&quot;. As of 2004, new films continue to break records, with many Korean productions achieving greater popularity than Hollywood films. Both &quot;Silmido&quot; and &quot;Taegukgi&quot; (&quot;The Brotherhood&quot;) were watched by over 10 million people, almost a quarter of the Korean population. &quot;Silmido&quot; is based on a true story about a secret special force, while &quot;Taegukgi&quot; is a blockbuster about the Korean War from the director of &quot;Shiri&quot;. The social satire and monster movie &quot;The Host&quot; (2006) broke Korean box office records and grossed $1.8 million in the United States.

This success attracted the attention of Hollywood. Films such as &quot;Shiri&quot; are now distributed in the United States. In 2001, Miramax bought the rights to an English-language remake of the successful Korean action comedy movie, &quot;My Wife is a Gangster&quot;.

Many Korean films also reflect the unique circumstances of the division and reunification of Korea.

In 2016, &quot;Train to Busan,&quot; directed by Yeon Sang-ho created a new sub division genre of zombie-like film in South Korea. Unlike many more western-made zombie films, Yeon uses an entirely Korean cast to establish and display a Korean-only film. Becoming a Korean zombie blockbuster film, modeled after &quot;Shiri(1999)&quot;, &quot;Train to Busan&quot; earned a worldwide grossing of US$93.1 million. The film reflects social and economic challenges in a developing South Korean society, creating a realistic perspective of the future.

In 2020, &quot;Parasite&quot;, directed by Bong Joon-ho, which depicts the economic inequality situation in the country, won four awards at the 92nd Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film, becoming the first non-English language film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.

===K-dramas===

Korean television and especially the short form dramatic mini-series colloquially called &quot;dramas&quot; by Koreans and &quot;K-dramas&quot; elsewhere have become extremely popular outside of Korea. Dramas were foremost among cultural exports trend in Asia and elsewhere. The trend has driven Korean stars to fame and has greatly boosted the image and prestige of Korean popular culture. One example that the Korean Wave of drama have come into existence is in 1997, when the national China Central Television Station (CCTV) aired a Korean television drama, &quot;What is Love All About?,&quot; turned out to be a big hit. Responding to popular demand, CCTV re-aired the program in 1998 and recorded the second-highest ratings ever in the history of Chinese television. In 1999, in Taiwan and China, another Korean television drama serial &quot;Stars in My Heart&quot;, became a big hit. Since then, Korean television dramas have rapidly taken up airtime on television channels in countries such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia, which saw media liberalization beginning in the 1990s.

Dramas showcase a wide range of stories, but the most prominent among the export dramas have been romance (&quot;All About Eve&quot;, &quot;Autumn Fairy Tale&quot;, &quot;Winter Sonata&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;My Name is Kim Sam Soon&quot;, &quot;Goong&quot;, &quot;My Girl&quot;, &quot;Boys Over Flowers&quot;, &quot;Shining Inheritance&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Heartstrings&quot;, &quot;Secret Garden&quot;, &quot;Dream High&quot;) and historical fantasy dramas (&quot;Dae Jang Geum&quot;, &quot;Emperor of the Sea&quot;, &quot;Jumong&quot;, &quot;Sungkyunkwan Scandal&quot;). Korea has also aired their first blockbuster spy drama, &quot;IRIS&quot;.

===Korean animation===

While &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is the best known back-room product of South Korea, many other popular English-language animation series (&quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;) have had the basic animation, in-betweening, and coloring done in South Korea; there has also been some South Korean collaborations and minor contributions on anime from Japan. This work is professional, but not necessarily Korean in tone or manner.

Recently, the animation &quot;Pororo the Little Penguin&quot; became one of the most popular cultural exports of South Korea, being exported to 120 countries worldwide. This little blue penguin has 1,500 spin-off products and a section in a theme park. Pororo is so powerful that Koreans call him Potongryong (&quot;President Pororo&quot;). According to the Seoul Business Agency, Pororo will generate global sales of 38 billion won (approximately US$36 million) this year, and the brand is worth 389.3 billion won for Iconix (the firm that created it) and others.

=== Korean comics or &quot;manhwa&quot; ===

In Korean, the term &quot;manhwa&quot; (), derived from manhua (), simply means &#x27;comics&#x27; but outside the two Korean states, it generally refers to the comics of South Korea, although some comics come from North Korea as well.

===Webtoons===

Webtoons are digital comics invented in February 2003 by the website Daum in South Korea. &quot;Love Story&quot; by Kang Full was the first successful webtoon that popularized the industry. Naver founded Line Webtoon in June 2004, and launched their website worldwide on July 2, 2004. Other countries including mainland China, India, Taiwan and Singapore have created their own Webtoon Industries.

<text>John Haugeland (; March 13, 1945 – June 23, 2010) was a professor of philosophy, specializing in the philosophy of mind, cognitive science, phenomenology, and Heidegger. He spent most of his career at the University of Pittsburgh, followed by the University of Chicago from 1999 until his death. He is featured in Tao Ruspoli&#x27;s film &quot;Being in the World&quot;.

==Education and career==

Haugeland studied at Harvey Mudd College, where he obtained a BS cum laude in physics in 1966. He received a PhD in philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, completing his dissertation, entitled &quot;Truth and Understanding&quot;, under the supervision of Hans Sluga in 1976. At Berkeley, Hubert Dreyfus served as one of his important mentors, becoming almost a &quot;de facto&quot; doctoral advisor.

Haugeland spent most of his career teaching at the University of Pittsburgh, from 1974 until 1999, and he also served as a visiting professor at Helsinki University, Finland. He served as chair of the philosophy department at the University of Chicago from 2004 to 2007. 

Haugeland was a research fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities and of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. He had also been a member of the Council for Philosophical Studies. Before attending graduate school Haugeland served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Tonga.

==Philosophical work==

In &quot;Artificial Intelligence: The Very Idea&quot;, Haugeland coined the term GOFAI (&quot;Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence&quot;) for symbolic artificial intelligence.

In &quot;Having Thought&quot;, he gathered together some of his most influential papers, thirteen, ordered both chronologically and also thematically, under a number of subject headings, namely &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;matter&quot;, &quot;meaning&quot; and &quot;truth&quot;. Subject heading &quot;mind&quot; elaborates about cognitive science, with a couple of papers, and about Hume with a third one. Subject heading &quot;matter&quot; addresses, through three papers, the relation between the intelligibility of mind and the material or physical. &quot;Meaning&quot; musters diverse papers all about the relationship between us and the world and, finally, &quot;truth&quot; deals, by means of four papers, with objectivity in terms of &quot;constitution&quot; as grounded in commitment.

Philosophers who completed their doctoral dissertations under John Haugeland&#x27;s supervision include Danielle Macbeth, Tim van Gelder, Quill Kukla, and Zed Adams.

<doc id="339432" wikidata="Q480336" url="?curid=339432" title="Ablepharus">
<text>Ablepharus is a genus of skinks that contains the common snake-eyed skinks. Both their scientific and common names refer to the fact that their eyelids have fused to a translucent capsule; as in snakes, they thus are physically incapable of blinking. They are small lizards and prefer to live in the leaf litter of dry fields and hills. Their scales give them a very shiny, bronze appearance with a characteristically dark stripe down the sides of their bodies. They prey on small insects and other small mollusks.

==Characteristics==
===Appearance===
The scales on all &quot;Ablepharus&quot; species are shiny and bronze in appearance. Also, a very characteristic bronze stripe runs the length of the dorsal surface of the body. They have short, weak front legs, which contribute to their moving in a serpentine-like manner. In general, females are longer and weigh more than their male counterparts. &quot;Ablepharus&quot; species have thick tails relative to their body sizes and lengths. Fully mature &quot;Ablepharus&quot; species can reach a total length (including tail) of up to . On average, both males and females reach a total length of up to about .

===Mannerisms and habitat===
As a whole, &quot;Ablepharus&quot; skinks are generally shy creatures. They tend to bask in the sunlight during the daytime and become more active as dusk and darkness approach. They make their homes in rocky areas with leaf litter and little soil.

===Distribution===
The geographic range of the common snake-eyed skink spans from southern European countries to northern African countries; also, some species are native to southeast Asia. While most of the species in the genus prefer remaining low to the ground and in drier environments, some species may be found in damper habitats up to 2,000 m above sea level.

===Diet===
Analysis of the stomach contents of certain &quot;Ablepharus&quot; species has led to the conclusion that common snake-eyed skinks are typically generalist predators. They mainly feed on small arthropods, mollusks, and small snails.

===Lifecycle===
In captivity, common snake-eyed skinks are known to survive up to three and a half years; in the wild, where they are preyed upon, they live about two and a half years. Upon reaching reproductive maturity, the female snake-eyed skink lays between two and four eggs at a time; these eggs will then take at least 9 weeks to hatch. Hatchlings typically measure around 3.5 cm long. About two years are needed for the hatchlings to reach reproductive maturity.

==Species==

<text>Acontias is a genus of limbless skinks, the lance skinks, (family Scincidae) in the African subfamily Acontinae. Most are small animals, but the largest member of the genus is &quot;Acontias plumbeus&quot; at approximately snout-vent length. All members of this genus are live-bearing sandswimmers, with fused eyelids. A recent review moved species that were formerly placed in the genera &quot;Typhlosaurus&quot;, &quot;Acontophiops&quot;, and &quot;Microacontias&quot; into this genus, as together these form a single branch in the tree of life. This new concept of &quot;Acontias&quot; is a sister lineage to &quot;Typhlosaurus&quot;, and these two genera are the only genera within the subfamily Acontinae.

==Species==
These 24 species are recognized:
* &quot;Acontias albigularis&quot; – white-throated legless skink
* &quot;Acontias aurantiacus&quot; – golden blind legless skink
* &quot;Acontias bicolor&quot; 
* &quot;Acontias breviceps&quot; – shorthead lance skink
* &quot;Acontias cregoi&quot; – Cregoe&#x27;s legless skink
* &quot;Acontias fitzsimonsi&quot; – Fitzsimons&#x27;s legless skink 
* &quot;Acontias gariepensis&quot; – Mier Kalahari legless skink
* &quot;Acontias gracilicauda&quot; – thin-tailed legless skink, slendertail lance skink 
* &quot;Acontias jappi&quot; – Japp’s burrowing skink 
* &quot;Acontias kgalagadi&quot; – Kalahari burrowing skink, Kgalagadi legless skink
* &quot;Acontias lineatus&quot; – striped dwarf legless skink, lined lance skink
* &quot;Acontias meleagris&quot; – Cape legless skink, golden sand skink; spotted slow skink; thick-tailed blindworm, erdslang, Linnaeus&#x27;s lance skink
* &quot;Acontias mukwando&quot; – Serra da Neve lance-skink
* &quot;Acontias namaquensis&quot; – Namaqua legless skink, Namaqua lance skink 
*&quot;Acontias occidentalis&quot; – western burrowing skink, savanna legless skink 
* &quot;Acontias orientalis&quot; – eastern striped blindworm, Eastern Cape legless skink 
* &quot;Acontias parietalis&quot; – Maputaland legless skink 
* &quot;Acontias percivali&quot; – Percival&#x27;s lance skink, Teita limbless skink
* &quot;Acontias plumbeus&quot; – giant legless skink, giant lance skink
* &quot;Acontias richardi&quot; – Richard’s legless skink
* &quot;Acontias rieppeli&quot; – Woodbush legless skink
*&quot;Acontias schmitzi&quot; 
*&quot;Acontias subtaeniatus&quot; – stripe-bellied legless skink
* &quot;Acontias wakkerstroomensis&quot; – Wakkerstroom legless skink

<text>Amphiglossus is a genus of skinks, lizards in the family Scincidae.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Amphiglossus&quot; is usually placed in the subfamily Scincinae, which seems to be paraphyletic, however. Probably quite close to &quot;Paracontias&quot; and possibly &quot;Androngo trivittatus&quot;, it belongs to a major clade which does not seem to include the type genus &quot;Scincus&quot;. Thus, it will probably be eventually assigned to a new, yet-to-be-named subfamily.

==Species==
The following species are recognized as being valid. Some species which were formerly included in the genus &quot;Amphiglossus&quot; have been assigned to a more recently created genus, &quot;Madascincus&quot; , some to the genera &quot;Flexiseps&quot; and &quot;Brachyseps&quot;, and some species have been synonymized with other species in the genus &quot;Amphiglossus&quot;.
*&quot;Amphiglossus astrolabi&quot; – diving skink
*&quot;Amphiglossus reticulatus&quot; 

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: In the above list, a binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Amphiglossus&quot;.

<text>Ateuchosaurus is a genus of skinks, lizards in the family Scincidae. The genus contains only two species which are indigenous to East Asia and Southeast Asia.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Ateuchosaurus&quot; is usually placed in the subfamily Scincinae. This group seems to be paraphyletic however, and the present genus is apparently not closely related to most or all of them. Different molecular studies find &quot;Ateuchosarus&quot; to instead to be more closely related either to &quot;Acontias&quot; or to lygosomine skinks, and it is therefore sometimes considered to represent a distinct family or subfamily.

<doc id="339450" wikidata="Q1258082" url="?curid=339450" title="Arch of Galerius and Rotunda">
<text>The Arch of Galerius () or Kamara (Καμάρα) and the Rotunda (Ροτόντα) are neighbouring early 4th-century AD monuments in the city of Thessaloniki, in the region of Central Macedonia in northern Greece. As an outstanding example of early Byzantine art and architecture, in addition to the importance of the Rotunda as one of the earliest Christian monuments in the Eastern Roman Empire, both sites were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1988 as part of the Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki.

==History==

The 4th-century Roman emperor Galerius commissioned these two structures as elements of an imperial precinct linked to his Thessaloniki palace. Archeologists have found substantial remains of the palace to the southwest. These three monumental structures were connected by a road that ran through the arch, which rose above the major east–west road of the city.
At the crux of the major axes of the city, the Arch of Galerius emphasized the power of the emperor and linked the monumental structures with the fabric of 4th-century Thessaloniki. The arch was composed of a masonry core faced with marble sculptural panels celebrating a victory over Narses (Narseh), the seventh emperor in the Sassanid Persian Empire, in 299 AD. About two-thirds of the arch is preserved.

The Rotunda was a massive circular structure with a masonry core that had an oculus like the Pantheon in Rome. It has gone through multiple periods of use and modification as a mausoleum, a Christian basilica, a Muslim mosque, and again a Christian church (and archaeological site). A minaret is preserved from its use as a mosque, and ancient remains are displayed on its southern side.

At some point, the knowledge of why the arch was constructed and who it was dedicated to was lost, as the arch simply depicts scenes from the triumph over the Persians and does not directly name Galerius. By the time of Ottoman rule of the region as part of Salonica vilayet in the 19th century, the arch was loosely speculated to be dedicated to one of the famous rulers people were familiar with - Constantine the Great, Philip II of Macedon, and Alexander the Great. It was sometimes called the &quot;Arch of Philip&quot;, &quot;Arc du Constantin&quot;, and equivalents during this period. Karl Frederik Kinch examined the arch in 1880s, and published a monograph in 1890 identifying that the arch was dedicated to Galerius.

In late 1864, when Frenchman Emmanuel Miller arrived in the city with the aim to remove and take to France the portico known as Las Incantadas the population of the city loudly objected, and the public outcry grew even more intense when false rumours spread that Miller also intended to dismantle and remove the Arch of Galerius as well; the arch was not touched at all or taken (but Las Incantadas was).

==Location and description of the Arch==
The Arch of Galerius stands on what is now the intersection of Egnatia and Dimitriou Gounari streets. Construction of the arch was spanned the years 298 and 299 AD; it was dedicated in 303 AD to celebrate the victory of the tetrarch Galerius over the Sassanid Persians at the Battle of Satala and the capture of their capital Ctesiphon in 298.
The structure was an octopylon (eight-pillared gateway) forming a triple arch that was built of a rubble masonry core faced first with brick and then with marble panels with sculptural relief. The central arched opening was 9.7 m wide and 12.5 m high, and the secondary openings on other side were 4.8 m wide and 6.5 m high. The central arch spanned the portion of the Via Egnatia (primary Roman road from Dyrrhacium to Byzantium) that passed through the city as a &quot;decumanus&quot; (east-west major street). A road connecting the Rotunda ( northeast) with the Palace complex (235m southwest) passed through the arch along its long axis.

Only the northwestern three of the eight pillars and parts of the masonry cores of the arches above survive: i.e., the entire eastern side (four pillars) and the southernmost one of the western pillars are lost. Extensive consolidation with modern brick has been performed on the exposed masonry cores to protect the monument. The two pillars flanking the central arched passageway retain their sculpted marble slabs, which depict the wars of Galerius against the Persians in broadly panegyric terms.

===Sculptural program of the Arch===

Understanding of the sculptural program of the arch is limited by the loss of the majority of the marble panels, but the remains give an impression of the whole. Four vertically stacked registers of sculpted decoration were carved on each pillar, each separated by elaborate moldings. A label for the Tigris River indicates that there were likely labels on other representations as the builders deemed necessary. Artistic license was taken in the representations, for instance, the Caesar Galerius is shown in personal combat with the Sassanid Shah Narses in one of the panels; although they never met in battle. On the arch a mounted Galerius attacks a similarly mounted Narses with a lance as an eagle bearing a victory wreath in its talons approaches Galerius. The Caesar sits securely on his rearing horse, while the Persian king appears nearly unhorsed. Terrified Persians cower under the hooves of the Caesar&#x27;s horse in the chaos of battle. The panel expresses the power of the Caesar Galerius.
The relief of the imperial family conjoined in a sacrifice of thanksgiving owes its distant prototype to the Augustan reliefs on the &quot;Ara Pacis&quot; in Rome. Galerius&#x27; wife, Diocletian&#x27;s daughter Valeria, is shown at his side, helping authenticate his connection to his predecessor.

In another panel, the tetrarchs are all arrayed in the toga as a &quot;Victoria&quot; holds a victory wreath out to the heads of the two &quot;Augusti&quot;. A third panel celebrates the unity of the tetrarchy, with a depiction of the tetrarchs standing together; the depersonalized manner in which the tetrarchs are portrayed is reminiscent of the schematic statues of the tetrarchs in porphyry at St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice. Only Galerius is dressed in armor, and he makes the offering upon the altar.

What remains of the arch asserts the glory of the tetrarchy and the prominence of Galerius within that system. The arch celebrates the Roman Empire as part of Galerius&#x27; victory over the Sassanid king. Galerius is also pictured on his horse at the right, while attacking a Sassanid guard.

==Rotunda of Galerius==

===Location and description of the Rotunda===
The Rotunda of Galerius, also known as the Rotunda of Saint George, is northeast of the Arch of Galerius at 40°37&#x27;59.77&quot;N, 22°57&#x27;9.77&quot;E. It is also known (by its consecration and use) as the Greek Orthodox Church of &quot;Agios Georgios&quot;, and is informally called the Church of the Rotunda (or simply The Rotunda).

The cylindrical structure was built around 306 AD on the orders of the tetrarch Galerius, who was thought to have intended it to be his mausoleum. Its circular, centrally planned structure resembles other structures such as Santa Costanza in Rome and is similarly topped by a dome. The structure was converted into a church in the late fourth century and an apsidal choir extension was added as well as a wide ambulatory around the perimeter.

The Rotunda has a diameter of 24.5 m. Its walls are more than 6 m thick, which is why it has withstood Thessaloniki&#x27;s earthquakes. The walls are interrupted by eight rectangular bays, with the west bay forming the entrance. A flat brick dome, 30 m high at the peak, crowns the cylindrical structure. In its original design, the dome of the Rotunda had an &quot;oculus&quot;, as does the Pantheon in Rome.

===Uses of the Rotunda===
After Galerius&#x27;s death in 311, he was buried at Felix Romuliana (Gamzigrad) near Zajecar, Serbia. The Rotunda stood empty for several decades until the Emperor Theodosius I ordered its conversion into a Christian church in the late fourth century. The church was embellished with very high quality mosaics. Only fragments have survived of the original decoration, for example, a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer, in front of complex architectural fantasies.

The building was used as a church dedicated to the Archangels (, ) for over 1,200 years until the city fell to the Ottomans. In 1590 it was converted into a mosque, called the Mosque of Suleyman Hortaji Effendi, and a minaret was added to the structure. It was used as a mosque until 1912, when the Greeks captured the city during the Balkan War. Greek Orthodox officials reconsecrated the structure as a church, and they left the minaret. The structure was damaged during an earthquake in 1978 but was subsequently restored. , the minaret was still being stabilized with scaffolding. The building is now a historical monument under the Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities of the Greek Ministry of Culture, although the Greek Orthodox Church has access to the monument for various festivities some days of the year (as Church of Saint George).

The Rotunda is the oldest of Thessaloniki&#x27;s churches. Some Greek publications claim it is the oldest Christian church in the world, although there are competitors for that title. It is the most important surviving example of a church from the early Christian period of the Greek-speaking part of the Roman Empire.

===Mosaics of the Rotunda===

The Rotunda&#x27;s cupola and the barrel vaults were originally entirely covered in mosaics, many of which are now lost. The surviving mosaics depict many organic forms such as a garland of fruit and evergreen plants that surrounded the lost image of Christ in the cupola. The evergreen wreath is composed of twenty-five sections of branches with white lilies, laurels, pears, grapes and pomegranates. The presence of this evergreen suggests ideas of rebirth and by extension the Resurrection while the inclusion of various plants associated with all the four seasons could symbolize renewal and eternity. In the light openings there are scrolls of ripe fruit accompanied by white lilies. These fruits could symbolize the abundance of heaven while the lily a visual reminder of Christian purity. In the strongly colored barrel vaults one panel displays a variety of fruits including grapes while another depicts a golden cross surrounded by many stylized flowers and acanthus leaves. Acanthus leaves are an ornament dating back to antiquity and were often heavily employed in Greco-Roman architectural adornment. Traditionally acanthus leaves have been interpreted to symbolize enduring life and immortality, making them suitable to promulgate Christian ideas of enduring life with Christ after death, adopting pagan symbolism into Christian ornament in a syncretic manner.

<text>Libor Pešek (22 June 1933 – 23 October 2022) was a Czech conductor. He was among the most famous conductors of his time, working regularly across Europe as chief conductor of orchestras in Prague, but also for ten years with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic. His career spanned more than 70 years during which he won awards from Great Britain and others. He conducted Czech music by composers such as Vítězslav Novák, Josef Suk and Pavel Josef Vejvanovský better known by performances and recordings. 

== Life and career ==
Pešek was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on 22 June 1933. He attended a grammar school, where he established his own jazz band. He then studied conducting, piano, cello and trombone at the Academy of Musical Arts, with Václav Smetáček and Karel Ančerl among his teachers.

Pešek worked at the Plzeň Opera and the Prague National Opera. From 1958 to 1964, he was the director of Prague Chamber Harmony, which he founded. In the seventies, he directed orchestras in Leeuwarden and Enschede, Netherlands. He also formed the Sebastian Orchestra. Pešek was chief conductor of the Slovak Philharmonic from 1981 to 1982, and from 1982 to 1990 was conductor-in-residence of the Czech Philharmonic. He served as the conductor at the inauguration of Václav Havel in December 1989.

In the UK, Pešek was music director of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic (RLPO) from 1987 to 1998, and held the title of conductor laureate then, which included an annual concert. His work with the RLPO included leading the premiere of Anthony Powers&#x27; Horn Concerto, with Michael Thompson as the soloist. He led the orchestra in 1993 to open the Prague Spring festival, the first foreign orchestra to be invited. He also took the group on its first tour of the United States. During his time with the RLPO, it was dubbed &quot;the best Czech orchestra outside Prague&quot;.

Beginning in 2007, Pešek was the chief conductor of the Czech National Symphony Orchestra. He stood down from this position at the close of the 2018–2019 season.

Pešek was best known for his interpretations of Czech music. He was a champion of lesser known Czech composers, particularly Josef Suk and Vítězslav Novák. His recordings included music of Pavel Josef Vejvanovský.

On 23 October 2022, Jan Hasenöhrl, a Czech trumpeter, announced Pesek´s death, Pesek was 89.

==Awards and honours==
Pešek was appointed an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1996, on the occasion of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s state visit to Prague. He was conferred the First Grade of the Czech Medal of Merit by Václav Havel one year later. In recognition of him selling 635,000 records, Pešek was given a diamond record by Supraphon in 2013.

<text>Acritoscincus is a genus of Australian skinks (family Scincidae). It belongs to the &quot;Eugongylus&quot; group; the genus &quot;Oligosoma&quot; appears to be a fairly close relative. An alternative name is Bassiana.

==Species==
*&quot;Acritoscincus duperreyi&quot; (Gray, 1838) -- eastern three-lined skink, bold-striped cool-skink
*&quot;Acritoscincus platynotus&quot; (Peters, 1881) -- red-throated cool-skink, red-throated skink
*&quot;Acritoscincus trilineatus&quot; (Gray, 1838) -- southwestern cool-skink, western three-lined skink, New Holland skink

<text>Brachymeles is a genus of skinks (lizards in the family Scincidae). The majority of the species within the genus are endemic to certain island ecosystems in the Philippines. In 2018, the Zoological Society of London through its EDGE of Existence Program listed the Cebu small worm skink (&quot;Brachymeles cebuensis&quot;) as the 80th most evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered reptile species in the world, making it the most endangered member of the genus &quot;Brachymeles&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Brachymeles&quot; is usually placed in the subfamily Scincinae, which seems to be paraphyletic however. Apparently part of a clade which does not seem to include the type genus &quot;Scincus&quot;, it will probably be eventually assigned to a new, yet-to-be-named subfamily (Austin &amp; Arnold 2006).

<text>Josef Suk (4 January 1874 – 29 May 1935) was a Czech composer, violinist, and Olympic silver medalist. He studied under Antonín Dvořák, whose daughter he married.

==Biography==

From a young age, Josef Suk (born in Křečovice, Bohemia) was deeply involved and well trained in music. He learned organ, violin, and piano from his father, Josef Suk Sr., and was trained further in violin by the Czech violinist Antonín Bennewitz. His theory studies were conducted with several other composers including Josef Bohuslav Foerster, , and . He later focused his writing on chamber works under the teachings of Hanuš Wihan. Despite extensive musical training, his musical skill was often said to be largely inherited. Though he continued his lessons with Wihan another year after the completion of his schooling, Suk&#x27;s greatest inspiration came from another of his teachers, Czech composer Antonín Dvořák.

Known as one of Dvořák&#x27;s favorite pupils, Suk also became personally close to his mentor. Underlying this was Dvořák&#x27;s respect for Suk, reflected in Suk&#x27;s 1898 marriage to Dvořák&#x27;s daughter, Otilie, marking some of the happiest times in the composer&#x27;s life and music. However, the last portion of Suk&#x27;s life was punctuated with tragedy. Over the span of 14 months around 1905, not only did Suk&#x27;s mentor Dvořák die, but so did Otilie. These events inspired Suk&#x27;s &quot;Asrael Symphony&quot;.


Owing to a shared heritage—and the coincidence of their dying within a few months of one another—Suk has been closely compared, in works and style, to fellow Czech composer Otakar Ostrčil. Suk, alongside Vitezslav Novak and Ostrčil, is considered one of the leading composers in Czech Modernism, with much shared influence among the three coming in turn from Dvořák. Eminent German figures such as composer Johannes Brahms and critic Eduard Hanslick recognized Suk&#x27;s work during his time with the Czech Quartet. Over time, well known Austrian composers such as Gustav Mahler and Alban Berg also began to take notice of Suk and his work.

Although he wrote mostly instrumental music, Suk occasionally branched out into other genres. Orchestral music was his strong suit, notably the Serenade for Strings, Op. 6 (1892). His time with the Czech Quartet, though performing successful concerts until his retirement, was not always met with public approval. Several anti-Dvořák campaigns came into prominence; criticism not only being directed at the quartet, but towards Suk specifically. The leftist critic Zdeněk Nejedlý accused the Czech Quartet of inappropriately playing concerts in the Czech lands during World War I. While these attacks diminished Suk&#x27;s spirits, they did not hinder his work.

==Private life==

Suk married Dvorak&#x27;s daughter, , a composer in her own right, in 1898. They had one child, a son, also named Josef, in 1898. Otilie died of heart failure aged 27 in 1905, a year after her father. Josef Suk Jr. in turn was father of the acclaimed violinist Josef Suk, who died in 2011.

Suk retired in 1933, although he continued to be a valuable and inspirational public figure to the Czechs. Suk died on 29 May 1935, in Benešov, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic); he was buried in the cemetery of St Luke&#x27;s Church, Křečovice.

==Musical style==



Suk&#x27;s musical style started off with a heavy influence from his mentor, Dvořák. The biggest change of Suk&#x27;s style came after he reached a &quot;dead end&quot; in his early musical style (music played less of a role in Suk&#x27;s life outside of his schooling), just before he began a stylistic shift during 1897–1905, perhaps realizing that the strong influence of Dvořák would limit his work. Morbidity was always a large factor in Suk&#x27;s music. For instance, he wrote his own funeral march in 1889 and it appears significantly also in a major work, the &quot;funeral symphony&quot; &quot;Asrael&quot;, Op. 27. &quot;Ripening&quot;, a symphonic poem, was also a story of pain and questioning the value of life. Other works, however – such as the music he set to Julius Zeyer&#x27;s drama &quot;Radúz a Mahulena&quot; – display his happiness, which he credited to his marriage with Otilie. Another of Suk&#x27;s works, &quot;Pohádka&quot; (Fairy Tale), was drawn from his work with &quot;Radúz a Mahulena&quot;. The closest Suk came to opera is in his incidental music to the play &quot;Pod jabloní&quot; (Beneath the Apple Tree).

The majority of Suk&#x27;s papers are kept in Prague. There is also a new catalogue of Suk&#x27;s works that contains more manuscripts than any before it, some of them also containing sketches by Suk.

Suk said of himself: &quot;I do not bow to anyone, except to my own conscience and to our noble Lady Music… and yet at the same time I know that thereby I serve my country, and praise the great people from the period of our wakening who taught us to love our country.&quot;

<text>Limelight (also known as Drummond light or calcium light) is a non-electric type of stage lighting that was once used in theatres and music halls. An intense illumination is created when a flame fed by oxygen and hydrogen is directed at a cylinder of quicklime (calcium oxide), due to a combination of incandescence and candoluminescence. Although it has long since been replaced by electric lighting, the term has nonetheless survived, as someone in the public eye is still said to be &quot;in the limelight&quot;. The actual lamps are called &quot;limes&quot;, a term which has been transferred to electrical equivalents.

==History==
===Discovery and invention===
The limelight effect was discovered in the 1820s by Goldsworthy Gurney, based on his work with the &quot;oxy-hydrogen blowpipe&quot;, credit for which is normally given to Robert Hare. In 1825, a Scottish engineer, Thomas Drummond (1797–1840), saw a demonstration of the effect by Michael Faraday and realized that the light would be useful for surveying. Drummond built a working version in 1826, and the device is sometimes called the &quot;Drummond light&quot; after him.

===Early use in the United Kingdom===
The earliest known use of limelight at a public performance was outdoors, over Herne Bay Pier, Kent, on the night of 3 October 1836 to illuminate a juggling performance by magician Ching Lau Lauro. This performance was part of the celebrations following the laying of the foundation stone of the Clock Tower. The playbill called it &quot;koniaphostic&quot; light and announced that &quot;the whole pier is overwhelmed with a flood of beautiful white light&quot;. Limelight was first used for indoor stage illumination in the Covent Garden Theatre in London in 1837 and enjoyed widespread use in theatres around the world in the 1860s and 1870s.
Limelights were employed to highlight solo performers in the same manner as modern spotlights.

===Early use in the United States===
During the American Civil War in July and August 1863 calcium lights were used during the siege of Fort Wagner, allowing Union forces to illuminate their artillery target at night while supposedly blinding Confederate gunners and riflemen. Calcium lights were also installed on Union Navy ships.

Limelight was replaced by electric arc lighting in the late 19th century.

<text>Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee (; &#x27;Lau; born 24 August 1950) is a politician in Hong Kong. She is currently the Convenor of the Executive Council (ExCo) and a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo), as well as the founder and current chairperson of the New People&#x27;s Party. She was formerly a prominent government official of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and was the first woman to be appointed the Secretary for Security to head the disciplinary service. She is also the founder and Chairwoman of Savantas Policy Institute, a think-tank in Hong Kong.

Ip became a controversial figure for her role advocating the passage of the national security legislation to implement Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23, and after this legislation was withdrawn, she became the first principal official to resign from the administration of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. She took a sabbatical to study for a master&#x27;s degree. She contested the 2007 Hong Kong Island by-election for the Legislative Council but was defeated by Anson Chan in the two-horse race. She ran again in the 2008 Legislative Council election and won, gaining a seat in the Hong Kong Island. She was re-elected in the 2012 and 2016 elections.

Ip is widely known to be keen on the Chief Executive top post. She ran in both 2012 and 2017 Chief Executive elections but did not secure a minimum number of 150 nominations from the 1,200-member Election Committee to enter the race on both occasions. In 2020, Larry Diamond, her supervisor at Stanford University, publicly criticized Ip&#x27;s handling of the democracy movement and freedom of the press in Hong Kong.

==Early life==
Ip was born in what was then British Hong Kong in 1950; her father was a Chinese Singaporean trader Lau Fook-seng, and her mother was actress Wa Choi-Fung (華彩鳳), the second wife of her father. She attended St. Stephen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; College, after which she read English literature at the University of Hong Kong, graduating with first-class honours; she later obtained a Master of Letters degree from the University of Glasgow, where she studied Elizabethan poet, Sir Philip Sidney.

==Government career==
In the 1970s, Ip joined the Hong Kong Government as an Administrative Officer. In 1986, she, accompanied by her husband, went to the Stanford Graduate School of Business to study for an MS in Management under the Sloan Programme. She took various bureaucratic positions before she was appointed Director of Industry Department in September 1995.

===Ministerial career===
In August 1996, she was appointed Director of Immigration – a post usually filled by officials from within the Immigration Department. She was the first woman to hold the post, and continued until after the 1997 handover. While she held that post, the UK government decided to grant full British citizenship for 50,000 Hong Kong families. She was also head of immigration during the right of abode saga, when the Hong Kong government requested the National People&#x27;s Congress in Beijing to intervene after the courts ruled against the government, essentially granting the Hong Kong government the ability to simply ignore the court&#x27;s ruling after it granted right of abode to the children of Hong Kong residents who held right of abode whether or not those children were born in Hong Kong.

In July 1998, Ip was appointed to the post of Secretary for Security – again, the first woman to hold that post. She became the first government minister to &quot;declare her political stance&quot;.

Ip became one of the so-called 14 principal officials and a member of the Executive Council during Tung Chee-hwa&#x27;s second term in government on 1 July 2002. She was well known at that time as a hawkish, uncompromising figure in the Government, with some describing her as &quot;a staunch, arrogant, authoritarian and yet outspoken bureaucrat&quot;. As security minister, she promoted the adoption of the controversial Article 23 of Hong Kong&#x27;s Basic Law. After massive public protests and the government&#x27;s withdrawal of the proposed national security legislation, Ip resigned from office on 25 June 2003, citing personal reasons.

==Political career==
In 2003, Ip returned to Stanford University to pursue a master&#x27;s degree in East Asian Studies, with Larry Diamond as her supervisor. Her thesis, &quot;Hong Kong: Case Study in Democratic Development in Transitional Society&quot;, reportedly expressed admiration for a bicameral system and suggested that political parties in Hong Kong be strengthened and be more inclusive. She returned to Hong Kong in 2006. She set up a policy think tank, Savantas Policy Institute, giving rise to media speculation that she was planning to run for the office of Chief Executive sometime in the future. In September 2007, she declared her intention to run for the Legislative Council in the Hong Kong Island by-election. She apologised for her handling of the Article 23 situation, hoped to put it behind her. However, she received only 43% of the vote, defeated by Anson Chan.

===Legislative Councillor===
Ip ran in the 2008 Hong Kong legislative election in the Hong Kong Island geographical constituency, forming a ticket including dermatologist Louis Shih and two elected District Councillors, Albert Wong and Ronald Chan. Her ticket won a total of 61,073 votes, the second highest on Hong Kong Island and the fourth highest Hong Kong wide. She was sworn in as Legislative Councillor on 8 October 2008.

In January 2011, she launched a middle-class oriented party called New People&#x27;s Party. The party held two seats in the legislature, herself and Michael Tien, after the 2012 Legislative council election, in which Ip was elected with 30,289 votes, despite losing almost half of the votes. She was subsequently appointed to the Executive Council of Hong Kong by Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying after the election, in which she served until December 2016 when she ran for the Chief Executive for the second time. Her party expanded its district base when it allied with the Civil Force in 2014. Ip was re-elected to the Legislative Council in 2016, with the highest votes of 60,760 in Hong Kong Island.

===2012 Chief Executive bid===

Ip was known to be interested in the Chief Executive post. She expressed her intention to run in the 2012 election but dropped out on 15 December. Following a number of scandals surrounding Henry Tang, Ip re-announced her candidacy in the race on 20 February. She withdrew her candidacy after failing to receive enough nominations before the deadline and thus did not qualify to stand for the election on 29 February, which made her campaign last for only nine days.

===2017 Chief Executive bid===

Ip has expressed her intention to consider running in the 2017 Chief Executive election. After incumbent Leung Chun-ying announced he would not seek for re-election, Ip resigned from the Executive Council to launch her campaign. She announced her candidacy on 15 December under the campaign slogan &quot;Win back Hong Kong&quot; after receiving her party&#x27;s endorsement. She called for a relaunch of the electoral reform process under Beijing&#x27;s restrictive framework as decreed by the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) on 31 August 2020. She also pledged to enact controversial Article 23 with &quot;suitable measures&quot;.

Ip got emotional and tear-eyed in a media gathering, &quot;[I]n the past ten years I started from nothing, working hard bit by bit, splashing out my own money, putting in much mental and physical effort,&quot; Ip said as her voice shook. &quot;Can you say I had not taken on responsibilities for the Hong Kong society? When I handled Article 23, I did not perform satisfactorily?&quot; she defended herself, &quot;I have taken responsibility under the accountability system and have already apologised multiple times. I was not shameless, I did not hold onto my powers. I stepped down from the administration. I&#x27;ll leave for society to judge whether I have the guts to take on responsibilities. I definitely have taken on a lot of responsibilities.&quot; Ip&#x27;s remarks came after Leung Chun-ying praised Lam for her &quot;ability and willingness to take on responsibilities&quot; As Carrie Lam declared her candidacy and Tsang was expected to run, political analysts said that could endanger Ip&#x27;s chances of getting the minimum 150 nominations to enter the race. Ip revealed that two or three electors, including businessman Allan Zeman, have turned their backs on her to support Lam.

Supported by her New People&#x27;s Party and a few electors from business sectors, Ip also gained a nomination from a pro-democrat elector from the Accountancy subsector, who wished to send Ip into the race to split Lam&#x27;s votes. However, as Lam aimed to grab more than 600 nominations, Ip faced an uphill battle to secure her nominations. She urged &quot;a certain candidate&quot; not to ask for additional backing since that person had secured more than enough nominations already. Ip withdrew from the election, conceding the number of nominations hours before the nomination deadline on 1 March, for the second time after her 2012 bid. She received the number of nominations &quot;far behind what was needed&quot;. She attributed her failure to the restrictive selection process of the 1,200 structure of the Election Committee membership as she was &quot;squeezed out&quot; by the Beijing-supported Lam and democrats-supported Tsang and Woo.

==Views==
Ip has taken controversial stances during her career including advocating for the Public Order Ordinance and defending government policy denying right of abode to the children of Hong Kong people born in mainland China since the 1997 handover.

===Article 23===

According to Ku, Ip had turned herself into a provocative political figure due to her departure from the &quot;institutionalised bureaucratic ritual&quot; adopted by civil servants in the past. She spearheaded the government&#x27;s attempt to codify Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23, and pushed hard for it to be legislated by July 2003. Between September 2002 and July 2003, her popularity plunged. In October 2002, she made a remark about Adolf Hitler at the City University.
Ip downplayed any opposition to the bill, predicting only 30,000 people would show up at the planned demonstration(s). Ip blamed political and religious leaders for creating a &quot;herd mentality&quot;. Her popularity plummeted when one remark after another contradicted popular opinion, most notably in regard to her commitment to push the bill despite the commotion and chaos of the SARS outbreak in 2003.

Detractors also took shots at her bushy hairstyle, nicknaming her &quot;Broomhead&quot; (掃把頭). This included a comic book which caricatured her in police uniform and signature bushy hairstyle. She openly admitted that although she disliked the nickname, she would not change her hairstyle just to please her critics. Regarding the controversy she said &quot;I think I would like to be remembered as somebody who was not afraid to speak out, even if that might affect my popularity.&quot; Ip later said &quot;I made a mistake in promoting the bill&quot; and apologized for remarks she had made while pushing for Article 23.

===Views on democracy===
Ip has been criticised for her perceived inconsistent stance toward democracy. Following her return from the United States, she shifted her public position during her campaign for a seat in the legislative assembly in 2007 by saying &quot;the only way forward for Hong Kong is complete democratization&quot;, in contrast to her position before. Todd Crowell of the &quot;Asia Times&quot; referred to her as a &quot;born-again democrat&quot;. Anson Chan, her main rival supported by the pro-democracy camp in the 2007 by-election, labelled her a &quot;fake democrat&quot; because of this.

In February 2022, Ip wrote a commentary on &quot;SCMP&quot;, criticizing Western democracy and saying that &quot;Many continue to indulge in the fallacious fantasy that adopting a procedure for electing our political leaders based on public participation will deliver good governance.&quot;

In May 2023, after the government announced that District Councils would have democratically elected seats be reduced, Ip defended the government&#x27;s decision and said &quot;It is not in the interests of the city to be at loggerheads with its motherland, let alone a hotbed for separatism and subversion.&quot;

===Views on press freedom===
In July 2008, Ip was once again embroiled in controversy for her comments about police tactics used against reporters covering the heated scenes in queues for Olympics tickets. In commenting about the man-handling of Hong Kong reporters by the Beijing police, she had said that &quot;neck-shoving [techniques]... were most effective in stopping trouble-makers&quot;. The following day, she stated that she supported freedom of the press and apologised for the &quot;slip of the tongue&quot;, clarifying that she was neither implying that journalists were troublemakers, nor endorsing the actions of the police. Democratic Party lawmaker Yeung Sum referred to this as a &quot;Freudian slip&quot; that showed up her true colours.

===Allegedly racist comments on Filipino maids===
In April 2015, Ip wrote in a controversial article in &quot;Ming Pao&quot; that she had received complaints while she was Secretary for Security from 1998 to 2003, from &quot;foreign women&quot; in Discovery Bay that the government was &quot;allowing Filipino domestic helpers to seduce their husbands&quot;, and was accused of being sexist and racist by many media reports. The Philippines consulate expressed its concern over the &quot;unfortunate choice of words&quot; by Ip. A domestic helpers advocacy group demonstrated in front of her office, calling on her to apologise. She apologised to those who were offended by her and insisted that the article was misinterpreted.

===Views on fur wearing===
Ip was under fire for wearing a red mink coat to a Legislative Council meeting in January 2016. She defended her clothing choice, saying that &quot;wearing fur is actually the same as eating beef...Mink farming can be more humane than rearing chicken or cattle.&quot; She was criticised by animal rights activists.

===Lying about Liaison Office visit===
On 5 September 2016 one day after the 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Council election in which she was re-elected, Ip&#x27;s car was photographed at the Liaison Office. She told &quot;Ming Pao&quot; that she was not in the car and she was sending some books she wrote to her friends there. She later admitted that she lied about it as she was requested by the other party to keep the visit confidential. She was criticised as the pan-democrats had been accusing the Liaison Office for meddling in local politics and elections. She apologised to the public and &quot;Ming Pao&quot; and denied that she was there for thanking the Liaison Office for its support.

=== &quot;Hong Kong Is China, Like It or Not&quot; ===
On October 1, 2020, the New York Times published an opinion piece by Ip, titled &quot;Hong Kong Is China, Like It or Not&quot;. In the piece, Ip defended the Hong Kong Police Force&#x27;s actions during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and publicly supported the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. Ip wrote:

The National Review and The Spectator criticized the op-ed, as did HuffPost freelance reporter Yashar Ali and CBS News correspondent Kathryn Watson.

=== BN(O) and dual citizenship===
In October 2020, SCMP reported that Ip has previously said that if the Chinese foreign ministry imposes restrictions on Hong Kong BN(O) passports, then the Hong Kong Immigration Department may instruct airline companies to stop issuing tickets to those with BN(O) passports. In February 2021, SCMP reported that the move to ban BN(O) passports has left ethnic minorities without a valid passport, as many have encountered issues while applying for a Hong Kong passport. The move would practically stop the freedom of these Hong Kong citizens from leaving Hong Kong.

In January 2021, Ip wrote an opinion article on SCMP, stating that those with dual passports in Hong Kong should choose between their non-Hong Kong citizenship or their right of abode in Hong Kong, saying that those who choose their non-Hong Kong foreign citizenship &quot;could also lose the right of abode in Hong Kong and the attendant right to vote in Hong Kong elections.&quot; This is despite the fact that high-level government officials, including Carrie Lam, Tam Yiu-chung, and Tung Chee-hwa have children with foreign citizenship. Ip mentions that her suggestion was just a proposal and she did not raise the issue with the Hong Kong SAR government.

In February 2021, &quot;Hong Kong Free Press&quot; reported that around 7,000 people had emigrated from Hong Kong to the UK since June 2020, with Ip claiming those people had &quot;no money, skills or education&quot;.

In March 2021, Ip said that those in Hong Kong who use the BN(O) passport for working holiday visa applications to 14 countries should be denied the ability to fly on airlines by the government.

=== Overseas voting ===
While discussing a proposal to allow overseas Hong Kongers to vote, Ip gave her reasoning for not allowing all overseas Hong Kongers to vote, and only allowing those living in mainland China to vote. Ip said that under the &quot;One country&quot; principle, those who live in China should get first priority when it comes to overseas voting.

=== Separation of powers ===

In October 2020, Ip claimed that Hong Kong has never had separation of powers, and that government officials should reiterate that the city does not have it.

=== Expulsion of Legislative Council members ===
In November 2020, following the expulsion of 4 pro-democracy lawmakers in the Legislative Council, Ip defended the expulsion and said &quot;They cannot be just democrats in name. They have to not only embrace true democratic values in the sense of respecting the rule of law and the rights of other people with whom they disagree, they also have to respect the sovereignty, security of our country.&quot; Additionally, Ip said that &quot;Time will tell that it was the right decision to take.&quot;

=== Arrests of pro-democracy figures ===
After the arrest of 53 pro-democracy figures in January 2021, Ip defended the arrests, stating that their goal of taking control of the Legislative Council and not approving the budget would not be tolerated.

=== Xinjiang ===
In March 2021, after some companies suspended the use of cotton from Xinjiang due to human rights concerns, Ip stated that those companies were spreading lies about Xinjiang, and that she would boycott Burberry. Ip claimed that she would not wear products from the brand &quot;until Burberry has retracted or apologised for its unfounded allegations against Xinjiang.&quot; After some people asked her to burn her scarves, Ip said that she would just &quot;put them away for the time being&quot;.

=== RTHK ===
In 2019, Ip said that RTHK should stop producing news in Chinese. In April 2021, Ip suggested that RTHK be shut down, and said that RTHK staff &quot;often challenge the government&#x27;s bottom line.&quot;

=== LGBT and women&#x27;s rights ===
Ip has expressed desires to legislate against discrimination against LGBT people and supported the city to host the 2022 Gay Games. She, however, stopped short of supporting the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Hong Kong. On other social issues, such as sexism, Ip has criticised the media for focusing on what she called &quot;focusing on a female politician&#x27;s hairstyle, clothing and make up&quot; rather than her work and has expressed desire to reserve seats for women in election committees.

=== COVID-19 ===
In March 2022, Ip argued that &quot;dynamic zero-Covid&quot; would be necessary in Hong Kong.

In September 2022, Ip said that &quot;It is difficult for the government to come up with a road map for its anti-epidemic strategies now.&quot; Ip also dismissed concerns that international businesses had left Hong Kong due to its anti-epidemic policies. In contrast, the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce conducted a survey, which showed that 10% of large enterprises had permanently left Hong Kong, and an additional 30% of large enterprises were considering leaving or had left in the first half of 2022. The CEO of the chamber called for an immediate lifting of all anti-epidemic entry restrictions into the city.

=== Taiwan ===
In August 2022, after senior Hong Kong government officials, including John Lee, criticized Nancy Pelosi for visiting Taiwan and threatened to assist Beijing with &quot;all necessary measures&quot; to defend national sovereignty, Ip said &quot;&quot;Those in important positions of the government must share the nation&#x27;s core values on sovereignty, national security, developmental interests and territorial integrity.&quot; However, Ip made a seemingly contradictory statement and said that &quot;Hong Kong has no role to play&quot; in the countermeasures, and also said it was difficult to say how much power Hong Kong had on the issue.

=== Hong Kong Golf Club ===
In August 2022, Ip fought against plans to build public housing on the Fanling golf course, used by the Hong Kong Golf Club, of which Ip is a member. The plan to build housing there was generally favored by the public. Later in the month, Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn said that despite lobbying by Ip and the Hong Kong Golf Club, &quot;The government, at this moment, is still fully committed to implementing this project and we have not changed our mind.&quot;

Despite being a member of the exclusive Hong Kong Golf Club, Ip said that she is &quot;not a golfer&quot;, stating &quot;I am not a golfer, but the 3 18-hole golf courses at Fanling are among the finest in Asia.&quot;

Ip also said &quot;I hope nobody calls the golf club rich and powerful or pins that label on it. Because it is a sport facility after all.&quot;

=== Stamp duty ===
In August 2022, Ip proposed waiving double stamp duties for mainland Chinese without right of abode in the city, taxes implemented earlier to cool down demand and prices for housing in Hong Kong. The government, within hours, responded that there were no plans to implement Ip&#x27;s idea, and said &quot;Regarding reports that the government is considering the relaxation of stamp duties for property, the government clarifies that there has not been discussion on the matter, and points out clearly that there are no relevant plans.&quot; Stock prices of property developers jumped on the news, and Ip later said about the contradiction &quot;the Bloomberg headline said the government had been considering it, so it caused some misunderstanding&quot; and that she would &quot;be more careful and explain things more clearly in the future for sure&quot;, without issuing an apology.

Paul Chan reaffirmed the government&#x27;s position, and later announced that there would be &quot;no plan or intention&quot; to reduce measures to cool down demand, against Ip&#x27;s suggestion.

=== Global Financial Leaders&#x27; Investment Summit ===
In October 2022, after several US lawmakers warned US financial executives to not attend the Global Financial Leaders&#x27; Investment Summit, Ip said that &quot;There are no human rights abuses in Hong Kong and accusations of export of &quot;illiberal world order&quot; are totally baseless&quot;.

=== Glory to Hong Kong ===
In November 2022, Ip said that the national security law has jurisdiction outside of Hong Kong, and that Hong Kong could extradite suspects from South Korea to Hong Kong. Ip made the comments in reference to an incident where Glory to Hong Kong was played in a rugby match in South Korea. In December 2022, Ip said that representatives from Google should be summoned to the Legislative Council to explain why the song was ranked so highly, and that &quot;If they ignore the summons, a warrant can be issued. It’s a criminal offence and offenders can be jailed up to 12 months.&quot;

=== Northern Metropolis ===
In March 2023, Ip said that the Northern Metropolis project should be prioritized over Lantau Tomorrow Vision; John Lee then responded by saying both projects would move ahead simultaneously without the need to prioritize one over the other. In April 2023, a survey showed that only 6% of Hongkongers supported Lee&#x27;s idea to build both simultaneously.

=== Overseas democrats ===
In July 2023, in response to the Hong Kong government putting bounties on 8 overseas democrats, Ip said &quot;As far as I know, some of the wanted people are very active in the UK. They hold tea parties in areas where many Hongkongers live. On the surface they are Hong Kong-style tea parties, but actually they are designed to brainwash and confuse politicians and to encourage them to condemn and sanction China.&quot; Ip also said &quot;Sending food to the wanted people for their tea parties may also be supporting their illegal activities and the police should investigate thoroughly and stop these activities.&quot;

=== Birth rate ===
In August 2023, in response to Hong Kong&#x27;s falling birth rate, Ip suggested that frozen eggs and embryos should be allowed to be stored for 55 years, up from 10 years. Doctors and other experts responded to Ip&#x27;s suggestion and said that the changes would be unlikely to change the birth rate, as there was no real demand for longer storage.

=== Lionel Messi ===
In February 2024, after Lionel Messi did not participate in an exhibition match in Hong Kong, Ip said that &quot;Hong Kong people hate Messi, Inter Miami, and the black hand behind them, for the deliberate and calculated snub to Hong Kong&quot; and also said the government should ban him from entering Hong Kong. Messi later posted a video explaining his injury, and dismissed the idea that it was politically related.

==Personal life==
Ip married engineer Sammy Ip Man-ho (1935–1997) in 1981. Their marriage was opposed by Sammy Ip&#x27;s family. Sammy Ip was the son of Ip Ching-ping, founder of the Ching Hing Construction Company. Sammy Ip has a sister, Henrietta, who was a member of the Legislative Council (1982–1991). The couple has a daughter, Cynthia Ip Wing-yan, who was born in 1989. Sammy Ip died of liver cancer in 1997.

Ip has a personal driver.

== Property ownership ==
According to Ip&#x27;s declaration of assets as of January 2022, Ip owns 2 residential units, 4 parking spaces, and 1 industrial unit in Hong Kong.

In August 2023, Ip purchased a residential property through a company and defended the practice of paying minimal stamp duty, saying the government would have changed the law if it were an &quot;undesirable loophole&quot; to purchase property through company share transfers.

<text>British Museum was a station on the London Underground, located in Holborn, central London. It was latterly served by the Central line and took its name from the nearby British Museum in Great Russell Street.

The station was opened by the Central London Railway in 1900. In 1933, with the expansion of Holborn station, less than 100 yards away, British Museum station was permanently closed. It was subsequently utilised as a military office and command post, but in 1989 the surface building was demolished. A portion of the eastbound tunnel is used to store materials for track maintenance, visible from passing trains.

==History==
British Museum station was opened on 30 July 1900 by the Central London Railway (CLR; now the Central line), with its entrance located at No. 133, High Holborn (now Hogarth House, a co-working/workspace venue), near the junction with New Oxford Street. In December 1906, Holborn station was opened by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR; now the Piccadilly line) less than 100 yards away. Despite being built and operated by separate companies, it was common for the underground railways to plan routes and locate stations so that interchanges could be easily formed between services. This had been done by other lines connecting with the CLR stations at Oxford Circus and Tottenham Court Road, but an interchange station was not initially constructed between the GNP&amp;BR and the CLR because the tunnel alignment to British Museum station would not have been suitable for the GNP&amp;BR&#x27;s route to its Strand station (later renamed Aldwych). The junction between High Holborn and the newly constructed Kingsway was also a more prominent location for a station than that chosen by the CLR.
The possibility of an underground passageway was initially mooted, but the idea suffered from the complexity of tunneling between the stations. Holborn station was, in any case, better situated than British Museum, as it had better tram connections (Holborn had a stop on the now defunct Kingsway tramway subway). A proposal to enlarge the tunnels under High Holborn to create new platforms at Holborn station for the CLR and to abandon the British Museum station was originally included in a private bill submitted to parliament by the CLR in November 1913, although the First World War prevented any work taking place. The works were eventually carried out as part of the modernisation of Holborn station at the beginning of the 1930s when escalators were installed in place of lifts. British Museum station was closed on 24 September 1933, with the new platforms at Holborn opening the following day.
British Museum station was subsequently used up to the 1960s as a military administrative office and emergency command post, but the surface station building was demolished in 1989, and the platforms could no longer be accessed from street level. The platforms have since been removed, thus lowering the entire tunnel floor to track level. A portion of the eastbound tunnel is used by engineers to store materials for track maintenance, which can be seen from passing trains.

==In popular culture==
* In the Neil Gaiman novel &quot;Neverwhere&quot; the main character, Richard Mayhew, a Londoner, protests that there is no British Museum station, only to be proved wrong when his train stops there.
* The station was mentioned in the 1972 horror film &quot;Death Line&quot;, but contrary to popular belief, it is not the station portrayed in the film as being the home of a community of cannibals descended from Victorian railway workers. The cannibals venture out at night to snatch travellers from the platforms of operating stations and take them back to their gruesome &#x27;pantry&#x27; at an incomplete station. Donald Pleasence stars as the investigating police inspector, and when finally cornered, one of the cannibals screams a corrupted form of &quot;Mind the doors!&quot;, obviously having picked it up parrot-fashion from the guards on the Underground trains. The station in question is named simply &#x27;Museum&#x27; and is clearly stated as being &#x27;between&#x27; Holborn and British Museum stations in a conversation between Pleasence&#x27;s character and a colleague. It is supposedly part of a completely separate line that was not completed owing to the construction company going bankrupt. Signs in the abandoned station also only state &#x27;Museum&#x27; as the name.
* In the finale of the TV series &quot;Culprits&quot;, the climactic scene is set in the fictional ticket office of an abandoned station called British Museum.
* The station was featured in the Bulldog Drummond spin-off film &quot;Bulldog Jack&quot; as the location reached by a secret tunnel leading from the inside of a sarcophagus in the British Museum. The villain Morelle (Ralph Richardson) is finally cornered and forced into a sword duel on the disused platforms, which were a studio set. The station was renamed &#x27;Bloomsbury&#x27; in the film.
* The station briefly featured in the computer game &quot;Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror&quot;, in which Nico Collard escapes from the British Museum and finds the station. She then manages to stop the passing trains. The station in the game, however, is depicted as having its exit actually inside the British Museum itself. A station named &#x27;Museum&#x27; also features in the earlier game &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky&quot;, by the same company, but the apparent Australian setting for the latter game, as well as its proximity to a station named &#x27;St. James&#x27; suggests this is actually the Museum railway station in Sydney.
* The station is reputed to be haunted by the ghost of the daughter of an Egyptian Pharaoh called Amen-ra which would appear and scream so loudly that the noise would carry down the tunnels to adjoining stations.

<doc id="339488" wikidata="Q1924179" url="?curid=339488" title="Cloning vector">
<text>A cloning vector is a small piece of DNA that can be stably maintained in an organism, and into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted for cloning purposes. The cloning vector may be DNA taken from a virus, the cell of a higher organism, or it may be the plasmid of a bacterium. The vector contains features that allow for the convenient insertion of a DNA fragment into the vector or its removal from the vector, for example through the presence of restriction sites. The vector and the foreign DNA may be treated with a restriction enzyme that cuts the DNA, and DNA fragments thus generated contain either blunt ends or overhangs known as sticky ends, and vector DNA and foreign DNA with compatible ends can then be joined by molecular ligation. After a DNA fragment has been cloned into a cloning vector, it may be further subcloned into another vector designed for more specific use.

There are many types of cloning vectors, but the most commonly used ones are genetically engineered plasmids. Cloning is generally first performed using &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, and cloning vectors in &quot;E. coli&quot; include plasmids, bacteriophages (such as phage λ), cosmids, and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). Some DNA, however, cannot be stably maintained in &quot;E. coli&quot;, for example very large DNA fragments, and other organisms such as yeast may be used. Cloning vectors in yeast include yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs).

== Features of a cloning vector ==
All commonly used cloning vectors in molecular biology have key features necessary for their function, such as a suitable cloning site and selectable marker. Others may have additional features specific to their use. For reason of ease and convenience, cloning is often performed using &quot;E. coli&quot;. Thus, the cloning vectors used often have elements necessary for their propagation and maintenance in &quot;E. coli&quot;, such as a functional origin of replication (ori). The ColE1 origin of replication is found in many plasmids. Some vectors also include elements that allow them to be maintained in another organism in addition to &quot;E. coli&quot;, and these vectors are called shuttle vector.

===Cloning site===
All cloning vectors have features that allow a gene to be conveniently inserted into the vector or removed from it. This may be a multiple cloning site (MCS) or polylinker, which contains many unique restriction sites. The restriction sites in the MCS are first cleaved by restriction enzymes, then a PCR-amplified target gene also digested with the same enzymes is ligated into the vectors using DNA ligase. The target DNA sequence can be inserted into the vector in a specific direction if so desired. The restriction sites may be further used for sub-cloning into another vector if necessary.

Other cloning vectors may use topoisomerase instead of ligase and cloning may be done more rapidly without the need for restriction digest of the vector or insert. In this TOPO cloning method a linearized vector is activated by attaching topoisomerase I to its ends, and this &quot;TOPO-activated&quot; vector may then accept a PCR product by ligating both the 5&#x27; ends of the PCR product, releasing the topoisomerase and forming a circular vector in the process. Another method of cloning without the use of DNA digest and ligase is by DNA recombination, for example as used in the Gateway cloning system. The gene, once cloned into the cloning vector (called entry clone in this method), may be conveniently introduced into a variety of expression vectors by recombination.

===Selectable marker===
A selectable marker is carried by the vector to allow the selection of positively transformed cells. Antibiotic resistance is often used as marker, an example being the beta-lactamase gene, which confers resistance to the penicillin group of beta-lactam antibiotics like ampicillin. Some vectors contain two selectable markers, for example the plasmid pACYC177 has both ampicillin and kanamycin resistance gene. Shuttle vector which is designed to be maintained in two different organisms may also require two selectable markers, although some selectable markers such as resistance to zeocin and hygromycin B are effective in different cell types. Auxotrophic selection markers that allow an auxotrophic organism to grow in minimal growth medium may also be used; examples of these are &quot;LEU2&quot; and &quot;URA3&quot; which are used with their corresponding auxotrophic strains of yeast.

Another kind of selectable marker allows for the positive selection of plasmid with cloned gene. This may involve the use of a gene lethal to the host cells, such as barnase, Ccda, and the parD/parE toxins. This typically works by disrupting or removing the lethal gene during the cloning process, and unsuccessful clones where the lethal gene still remains intact would kill the host cells, therefore only successful clones are selected.

===Reporter gene===
Reporter genes are used in some cloning vectors to facilitate the screening of successful clones by using features of these genes that allow successful clone to be easily identified. Such features present in cloning vectors may be the &quot;lacZ&quot;α fragment for α complementation in blue-white selection, and/or marker gene or reporter genes in frame with and flanking the MCS to facilitate the production of fusion proteins. Examples of fusion partners that may be used for screening are the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and luciferase.

===Elements for expression===

A cloning vector need not contain suitable elements for the expression of a cloned target gene, such as a promoter and ribosomal binding site (RBS), many however do, and may then work as an expression vector. The target DNA may be inserted into a site that is under the control of a particular promoter necessary for the expression of the target gene in the chosen host. Where the promoter is present, the expression of the gene is preferably tightly controlled and inducible so that proteins are only produced when required. Some commonly used promoters are the T7 and &quot;lac&quot; promoters. The presence of a promoter is necessary when screening techniques such as blue-white selection are used.

Cloning vectors without promoter and RBS for the cloned DNA sequence are sometimes used, for example when cloning genes whose products are toxic to &quot;E. coli&quot; cells. Promoter and RBS for the cloned DNA sequence are also unnecessary when first making a genomic or cDNA library of clones since the cloned genes are normally subcloned into a more appropriate expression vector if their expression is required.

Some vectors are designed for transcription only with no heterologous protein expressed, for example for &quot;in vitro&quot; mRNA production. These vectors are called transcription vectors. They may lack the sequences necessary for polyadenylation and termination, therefore may not be used for protein production.

==Types of cloning vectors==
A large number of cloning vectors are available, and choosing the vector may depend upon a number of factors, such as the size of the insert, copy number and cloning method. Large insert may not be stably maintained in a general cloning vector, especially for those with a high copy number, therefore cloning large fragments may require more specialised cloning vector.

===Plasmid===

Plasmids are autonomously replicating circular extra-chromosomal DNA. They are the standard cloning vectors and the ones most commonly used. Most general plasmids may be used to clone DNA inserts of up to 15 kb in size. One of the earliest commonly used cloning vectors is the pBR322 plasmid. Other cloning vectors include the pUC series of plasmids, and a large number of different cloning plasmid vectors are available. Many plasmids have high copy numbers, for example, pUC19 has a copy number of 500-700 copies per cell, and high copy number is useful as it produces greater yield of recombinant plasmid for subsequent manipulation. However low-copy-number plasmids may be preferably used in certain circumstances, for example, when the protein from the cloned gene is toxic to the cells.

Some plasmids contain an M13 bacteriophage origin of replication and may be used to generate single-stranded DNA. These are called phagemids, and examples are the pBluescript series of cloning vectors.

===Bacteriophage===
The bacteriophages used for cloning are the λ phage and M13 phage. There is an upper limit on the amount of DNA that can be packed into a phage (a maximum of 53 kb), therefore to allow foreign DNA to be inserted into phage DNA, phage cloning vectors may need to have some non-essential genes deleted, for example the genes for lysogeny since using phage λ as a cloning vector involves only the lytic cycle. There are two kinds of λ phage vectors - insertion vector and replacement vector. Insertion vectors contain a unique cleavage site whereby foreign DNA with size of 5–11 kb may be inserted. In replacement vectors, the cleavage sites flank a region containing genes not essential for the lytic cycle, and this region may be deleted and replaced by the DNA insert in the cloning process, and a larger sized DNA of 8–24 kb may be inserted.

There is also a lower size limit for DNA that can be packed into a phage, and vector DNA that is too small cannot be properly packaged into the phage. This property can be used for selection - vector without insert may be too small, therefore only vectors with insert may be selected for propagation.

===Cosmid===
Cosmids are plasmids that incorporate a segment of bacteriophage λ DNA that has the cohesive end site (&quot;cos&quot;) which contains elements required for packaging DNA into λ particles. Under apt origin of replication (ori), it can replicate as a plasmid. It is normally used to clone large DNA fragments between 28 and 45 Kb.

===Bacterial artificial chromosome===
Insert size of up to 350 kb can be cloned in bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). BACs are maintained in &quot;E. coli&quot; with a copy number of only 1 per cell. BACs are based on F plasmid, another artificial chromosome called the PAC is based on the P1 phage.

===Yeast artificial chromosome===
Yeast artificial chromosome are used as vectors to clone DNA fragments of more than 1 mega base (1Mb=1000kb) in size. They are useful in cloning larger DNA fragments as required in mapping genomes such as in the Human Genome Project. It contains a telomeric sequence, an autonomously replicating sequence (features required to replicate linear chromosomes in yeast cells). These vectors also contain suitable restriction sites to clone foreign DNA as well as genes to be used as selectable markers.

===Human artificial chromosome===
Human artificial chromosome may be potentially useful as a gene transfer vectors for gene delivery into human cells, and a tool for expression studies and determining human chromosome function. It can carry very large DNA fragment (there is no upper limit on size for practical purposes), therefore it does not have the problem of limited cloning capacity of other vectors, and it also avoids possible insertional mutagenesis caused by integration into host chromosomes by viral vector.

===Animal and plant viral vectors===
Viruses that infect plant and animal cells have also been manipulated to introduce foreign genes into plant and animal cells. The natural ability of viruses to adsorb to cells, introduce their DNA and replicate have made them ideal vehicles to transfer foreign DNA into eukaryotic cells in culture. A vector based on Simian virus 40 (SV40) was used in first cloning experiment involving mammalian cells. A number of vectors based on other type of viruses like Adenoviruses and Papilloma virus have been used to clone genes in mammals. At present, retroviral vectors are popular for cloning genes in mammalian cells. In case of plants like Cauliflower mosaic virus, Tobacco mosaic virus and Gemini viruses have been used with limited success.
==Screening: example of the blue/white screen==

Many general purpose vectors such as pUC19 usually include a system for detecting the presence of a cloned DNA fragment, based on the loss of an easily scored phenotype. The most widely used is the gene coding for &quot;E. coli&quot; β-galactosidase, whose activity can easily be detected by the ability of the enzyme it encodes to hydrolyze the soluble, colourless substrate X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactoside) into an insoluble, blue product (5,5&#x27;-dibromo-4,4&#x27;-dichloro indigo). Cloning a fragment of DNA within the vector-based &quot;lacZα&quot; sequence of the β-galactosidase prevents the production of an active enzyme. If X-gal is included in the selective agar plates, transformant colonies are generally blue in the case of a vector with no inserted DNA and white in the case of a vector containing a fragment of cloned DNA.

<text>A lysogen or lysogenic bacteria is a bacterial cell that can produce and transfer the ability to produce a phage. A prophage is either integrated into the host bacteria&#x27;s chromosome or more rarely exists as a stable plasmid within the host cell. The prophage expresses gene(s) that repress the phage&#x27;s lytic action, until this repression is disrupted (see lytic cycle). Currently a variety of studies are being conducted to see whether other genes are active during lysogeny, examples of which include phage-encoded tRNA and virulence genes.

==History==
Theories about Lysogeny dominated the field of microbiology between 1920 and 1929. However, lysogenic bacteria were first brought to light by studies conducted in 1921 that explored the mechanisms between phages and bacteria.

==Lysogenic Conversion==
Lysogenic conversion is a process that occurs between a bacterium and a phage that is often beneficial for the bacteria. In lysogenic conversion, the phage inserts specific characteristics into the bacterial genes causing the bacteria to have better survival. Lysogenic conversion has been known to convert non-pathogenic bacteria into pathogenic bacteria that is capable of producing harmful toxins.

<doc id="339496" wikidata="Q719944" url="?curid=339496" title="As I was going to St Ives">
<text>&quot;As I was going to St Ives&quot; (Roud 19772) is a traditional English-language nursery rhyme in the form of a riddle.

The most common modern version is:

: As I was going to St Ives,
: I met a man with seven wives,
: Each wife had seven sacks,
: Each sack had seven cats,
: Each cat had seven kits:
: Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
: How many were there going to St Ives?

==Origins==

The following version is found in a manuscript (Harley MS 7316) dating from approximately 1730:

: As I went to St Ives
: I met Nine Wives
: And every Wife had nine Sacs,
: And every Sac had nine Cats
: And every Cat had nine Kittens

A version very similar to that accepted today was published in the &quot;Weekly Magazine&quot; of August 4, 1779:

: As I was going to St Ives,
: Upon the road I met seven wives;
: Every wife had seven sacks,
: Every sack had seven cats,
: Every cat had seven kits:
: Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
: How many were going to St Ives?

The earliest known published versions omit the words &quot;a man with&quot; immediately preceding the seven (or nine) wives, but he is present in the rhyme by 1837.
There were a number of places called St Ives in England when the rhyme was first published. It is generally thought that the rhyme refers to St Ives, Cornwall, when it was a busy fishing port and had many cats to stop the rats and mice destroying the fishing gear, although some people argue it was St Ives, Cambridgeshire, as this is an ancient market town and therefore an equally plausible destination.

==Answers==
The traditional understanding of this rhyme is that only &quot;one&quot; is going to St Ives—the narrator. All of the others are coming &quot;from&quot; St Ives. The trick is that the listener assumes that all of the others must be totaled up, forgetting that only the narrator is said to be going &quot;to&quot; St Ives. If everyone mentioned in the riddle were bound for St Ives, then the number would be 2,802: the narrator, the man and his seven wives, 49 sacks, 343 cats, and 2,401 kits.

This interpretation provided the basis for a verse reply from &quot;Philo-Rhithmus&quot; of Edinburgh, in the September 8, 1779, issue of the &quot;Weekly Magazine&quot;:

: Why the deuce do you give yourselves so much vexation,
: And puzzle your brains with a long calculation
: Of the number of cats, with their kittens and sacks,
: Which &quot;went&quot; to St Ives, on the old women&#x27;s backs,
: As you seem to suppose? – Don&#x27;t you see that the cunning
: Old Querist &quot;went only&quot;? – The rest were all &quot;coming&quot;.
: But grant the wives &quot;went&quot; too, – as sure&#x27;s they were married,
: &quot;Eight&quot; only could go, – for the rest were all &quot;carried&quot;.

Owing to various ambiguities in the language of the riddle, several other solutions are possible. While it is generally assumed that the narrator met the man and his wives coming &quot;from&quot; St Ives, the word &quot;met&quot; does not necessarily exclude the possibility that they fell in while traveling in the same direction. In this case, there is no trick; just an arithmetical calculation of the number of kits, cats, sacks, and wives, along with the man and the narrator. Another possible answer is that the man with seven wives might &quot;have&quot; seven wives, but that none of them was accompanying him on the journey. One way of stating the answer, taking account of these ambiguities, is &quot;at least one, the narrator plus anyone who happens to be travelling in the same direction&quot;. Still other interpretations concern the phrasing of the question, which might be understood to exclude the narrator. If only the narrator were travelling to St Ives, but the phrase, &quot;kits, cats, sacks, and wives&quot; excludes him, then the answer to the riddle is zero. If everyone—including those being carried—were travelling to St Ives, but only the kits, cats, sacks, and wives are counted, then the answer is precisely 2,800.

==Rhind mathematical papyrus==

A similar problem is found in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (Problem 79), dated to around 1650 BC. The papyrus is translated as follows:

The problem appears to be an illustration of an algorithm for multiplying numbers. The sequence 7, 72, 73, 74, 75 appears in the right-hand column, and the terms 2,801, 2×2,801, 4×2,801 appear in the left; the sum on the left is 7×2,801 = 19,607, the same as the sum of the terms on the right. The equality of the two geometric sequences can be stated as the equation (20 + 21 + 22)(70 + 71 + 72 + 73 + 74) = 71 + 72 + 73 + 74 + 75, which relies on the coincidence 20 + 21 + 22 = 7.

Note that the author of the papyrus listed a wrong value for the fourth power of 7; it should be 2,401, not 2,301. However, the sum of the powers (19,607) is correct.

The problem has been paraphrased by modern commentators as a story problem involving houses, cats, mice, and grain, although in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus there is no discussion beyond the bare outline stated above. The hekat was of a cubic cubit (approximately ).

==Trivia==
The riddle appears in the movie Die_Hard_with_a_Vengeance.

<text>Anson Maria Elizabeth Chan Fang On-sang, (; &quot;née&quot; Fang; born 17 January 1940) is a retired Hong Kong politician and civil servant who was the first ethnic Chinese and woman to serve as Chief Secretary, the second-highest position in both the British colonial government and the Hong Kong SAR government under the Chinese sovereignty from 1993 until she retired from the government in 2001, sparking speculations of her growing rift with Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.

Enjoying wide popularity during her tenure and often dubbed as &quot;Iron Lady&quot; and the &quot;Conscience of Hong Kong&quot;, Chan became increasingly outspoken about pushing for a faster pace of the democratisation in Hong Kong and defending the autonomy of Hong Kong. Supported by the pan-democracy camp, she stood in the 2007 Hong Kong Island by-election and briefly served as member of the Legislative Council. After her retirement in 2008, she continued to lobby domestically and internationally for democracy and autonomy of Hong Kong, until her retirement from public life entirely in 2020.

==Early life==
Anson Fang was born in Shanghai into an affluent family in 1940. Her father Fang Shin-hau was a banker and textile businessman who moved his family to the British colony of Hong Kong in 1948 on the eve of the Communist victory of the Chinese Civil War. Fang Shin-hau died suddenly in 1950 aged 36 when Anson was only ten, leaving eight children to her mother Fang Zhaoling. Anson&#x27;s mother took the eldest sons off to England to oversee their education, leaving the rest in the hands of Anson&#x27;s paternal grandmother and some uncles and aunts.

Her paternal grandfather, Fang Zhenwu, was a Kuomintang general who fought in the Second Sino-Japanese War, while her uncle, Sir Harry Fang Sin-yang was a well-known orthopaedic surgeon and served as an appointed member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong from 1974 to 1985. Her mother Fang Zhaoling who was also a Chinese painting master not only shouldered the responsibility of raising her children, but also tried to pursue her career as an artist.

Anson was educated at the Sacred Heart Canossian College and studied English literature at the University of Hong Kong. She put herself through university by working as a private tutor and for a year as a clerk at Queen Mary Hospital. Along with studies, she was keen on amateur dramatics, and it was through this that she met her future husband, Archibald Chan Tai-wing. She began work on a social work diploma, but later changed her mind and joined the Hong Kong Civil Service in 1962. The following year, she married Archie, who became a science teacher at St Joseph&#x27;s College.

==Colonial administration career==
When Chan joined the administrative service cadet in 1962, she was one of only two women to join the civil service at that time. Her salary was reportedly one-quarter that paid to men of equivalent grade. Afterwards, she progressed to the Economics Section of the Finance Branch in 1962, followed by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, then the Department of Commerce and Industry, and later back to Finance. In 1970, she became Assistant Financial Secretary in the Finance Branch of the Colonial Secretary, the first woman to attain that post. She became a senior administrative officer in 1970. During this period she helped set up the Association of Female Senior Government Officers to fight for better rights for women civil servants, notably pushing for wage parity with men.

===Director of Social Welfare===
Chan became the first female civil service director when appointed Director of Social Welfare in 1984. During her tenure, she was severely criticised by media for her handling of a child custody case in 1986, popularly known as the Kwok Ah-nui incident. An investigation by unofficial members of the Executive Council found that Chan had &quot;acted within the law&quot; in respect of her extreme powers, but recommended changes to the law and to the Social Welfare Department&#x27;s procedures to prevent re-occurrence of similar cases. She later admitted that the media pressure had made her &quot;very upset&quot; and this led to keep her distance from the press, at least for a few years.

===Chief Secretary===
From 1987 to 1993, she was Secretary for Economic Services. She served as Secretary for the Civil Service from April to October 1993 before becoming the 30th and last Chief Secretary, the head of the Hong Kong civil service, in November 1993. She mainly oversaw the localisation of the civil service during her time in this position. From 1994, she headed the Airport Development Steering Committee overseeing the construction of the new Chek Lap Kok Airport.

Chan was the first woman and the first ethnic Chinese to hold the second-highest governmental position in Hong Kong. The highest governmental position, the Governor, was always held by Britons before Hong Kong&#x27;s handover to People&#x27;s Republic of China. Chan was often described during this era as an &quot;Iron Lady&quot;, with &quot;an iron fist in a velvet glove&quot;. Chan was lauded as the most powerful woman in Asia for her role as the deputy of British Governor Chris Patten, and later first Chief Executive of the SAR Tung Chee-hwa. She was considered most trusted high official in Hong Kong by both the UK and PRC government to appoint her to the head of the civil service, before and after the handover of Hong Kong.

In the run-up to the handover of Hong Kong, she was often the &#x27;face of Hong Kong&#x27;, dispatched to reassure the wider world that the territory would not implode upon its return to China and that civil liberties would be upheld. Her confidence reassured many around the globe.

Within Hong Kong she had wide public support to be the first Chief Executive in the new administration but announced in October 1996 that she would not seek the role.

==SAR administration career==
After Hong Kong&#x27;s handover to China on 1 July 1997, Chan stayed on as head of the civil service under then Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, a valuable sign of stability and continuity for the new administration. She was always highly regarded: one British-born civil servant said that &quot;nothing would work without her&quot;, also noting that &quot;Tung needs her more than she needs him.&quot;

Chan was loyal in the main but her public utterances were occasionally at odds with Tung. It was enough to earn her a certain independence and the epithet of &quot;Hong Kong&#x27;s Conscience&quot;. In contrast to the more conservative Tung, Chan showed the greater support for democracy and freedom, and advocated a faster pace of democratisation.

In 1998, Chan was somewhat criticised for her role in the monitoring of the new Hong Kong International Airport construction at Chek Lap Kok. The airport had logistical difficulties upon its opening, and some blamed Chan for her lack of supervision.

===Defence of press freedom===
When pro-government figures in Hong Kong attacked the Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) for being too critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, Chan flew to its defence.

In the summer of 1999 RTHK became a platform for Taiwan-Mainland China discussions. A local member of the PRC&#x27;s National People&#x27;s Congress, Tsang Hin-chi, urged the government-owned radio station to exercise self-censorship and not to provide a platform that expressed the splitting of China; Xu Simin, a member of Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, urged RTHK to not allow Taiwan&#x27;s president broadcasts.

On 12 April 2000 Wang Fengchao, deputy director of Central Government&#x27;s Liaison Office, delivered a speech titled &quot;The Principle of One China and the Taiwan Issue&quot;. Wang hinted that Basic Law Article 23 should be enacted as quickly as possible in Hong Kong to protect China against treason and subversion. Chan spoke in a four-hour speech after Wang on the importance of press freedom and publication, as she believed in genuine press freedom without external pressures.

===Retirement from the government===
The constant criticism of mainland officials and policies was perceived by many to be one of the main reasons for Beijing to view Chan as a malefactor in Hong Kong politics. In what the Hong Kong media saw as a dressing down for Chan, PRC Vice Premier Qian Qichen told her at a function in Beijing to &quot;better support Tung&quot;, after there had been reports of disagreements between the two over the appointment of officials. Chan agreed in 1999 to delay her retirement until June 2002. However, Chan announced her resignation in January 2001, and officially stepped down in April of the same year. In a later interview, Chan said she resigned after she failed to persuade Tung to delay the introduction of the Principal Officials Accountability System, as she believed it was too early to introduce this system when the chief executive and half of the legislature were not directly elected.

==Post-civil service career==

After retiring from the civil service, Chan did not often show up in public. However, in December 2005, Chan participated in the protest march for democracy, against Donald Tsang&#x27;s constitutional reform package and has since participated in subsequent marches for universal suffrage.

In July 2006, she criticised the Commission on Strategic Development, chaired by Donald Tsang, for being &quot;rather slow and unsatisfactory&quot;, and announced her intention to start a &quot;Core Group&quot; to push for taking forward the debate on Hong Kong&#x27;s constitutional reforms. It was later announced that the group would consist of heavyweights including Allen Lee, Christine Loh, Elizabeth Bosher, Professor Johannes Chan, Chandran Nair and Lily Yam Kwan Pui-ying.

On 23 September 2006, in a news conference, Chan proclaimed that she would not run for the position of Chief Executive in 2007.

===Legislative Council by-election===

On 11 September 2007, Chan announced that she would run in the December 2007 by-election for the Hong Kong Island seat made vacant by the death of former DAB chairman Ma Lik. During the campaign, she was criticised by Alex Tsui, a former ICAC official who accused Chan of obtaining a 100% mortgage to purchase a flat in 1993 when she was Chief Secretary, suggesting an abuse of power. A City University commentator said the issue marked the start of a smear campaign against Chan, although Chan did not engage in smear-free politics either, accusing her rival Regina Ip, the former Secretary for Security supported by Beijing government, of being a &quot;fake democrat&quot;.

Chan was also revealed of having been also taken a seat in the board of Richemont, (where a board member is former legionnaire Taipan Simon Murray) the manufacturer of name brand luxury items, but which at that time also owned a 23% share of British American Tobacco. When this news of her board membership was revealed she immediately resigned from the board of Richemont.

In the early hours of 2 December 2007, Chan was elected in the by-election with 175,874 votes, securing about 55% of the vote. Regina Ip, Chan&#x27;s main rival, had 137,550 votes.

For this election, Chan spent HK$1.81 million, $330,000 more than Ip. Her two main donors were Sir Quo-wei Lee and his wife, and Hong Kong Democratic Foundation chairman George Cautherley, who donated HK$250,000 each. Next Media chairman Jimmy Lai donated HK$200,000, and the Democratic Party gave HK$65,840 &quot;for services&quot;.

On 6 July 2008, Chan announced that she would not be seeking re-election to the Legislative Council at the expiry of her term.

===International lobbying===

On 24 April 2013, Anson Chan launched a group called Hong Kong 2020 on the basis of the former &quot;Core Group&quot; and &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Commission on Constitutional Development&quot; to monitor and comment on the constitutional reform progress to achieve full universal suffrage for election of the Chief Executive in 2017 and all members of the Legislative Council by 2020.

In April 2014, Anson Chan and Martin Lee, founder of Hong Kong&#x27;s opposition Democratic Party, went to the United States and met U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, minority leader of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and members of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. The activists spoke out against Beijing increasing control over Hong Kong and their fear of only candidates picked by Beijing would be allowed to take part in the 2017 Chief Executive election. Lee and Chan also voiced concerns over press freedom in Hong Kong, referring to violent assaults on journalists and alleging that Beijing is pressuring advertisers to shun critical media. Biden underscored Washington&#x27;s &quot;long-standing support for democracy in Hong Kong and for the city&#x27;s high degree of autonomy under the &#x27;one country, two systems&#x27; framework&quot;. China warned the United States against meddling in Hong Kong&#x27;s internal affairs after Biden met with Chan and Lee. In response, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it &quot;firmly opposes any countries meddling in the city&#x27;s internal affairs in any way.&quot;

In July 2014, Anson Chan and Martin Lee visited the United Kingdom and met with Deputy Prime Minister and the leader of the coalition&#x27;s junior partner the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg and raised concerns over China&#x27;s jurisdiction of the region, and questioning Britain&#x27;s commitment to Hong Kong&#x27;s democratic development. Clegg affirmed Britain&#x27;s commitment to honour the pledge that if China breached the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Britain would &quot;mobilize the international community and pursue every legal and other avenue available&quot;. Liu Xiaoming, PRC ambassador to Britain, described Martin Lee and Anson Chan as &quot;bent on undermining the stability of Hong Kong&quot;.

In March 2019, Anson Chan and pro-democrat legislators Charles Mok and Dennis Kwok visited the United States and met with Vice President Mike Pence to speak against Beijing&#x27;s intervention in Hong Kong affairs and the proposed amendments to Hong Kong extradition law which later escalated to the massive anti-government protests. Chan expressed concerns on the special trading relationship between Hong Kong and the United States which guaranteed by the United States–Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. &quot;If [the US government’s] perception of &#x27;one country, two systems&#x27; changes, then we must be concerned that something could be done to change the content of the Hong Kong Policy Act,&quot; said Chan. The act stipulated that Hong Kong can enjoy a special trading status separate from that between mainland China and the U.S. because of the one country, two systems principle, under which the city has control over its own political and economic affairs.

In June 2020, aged 80, and following the death of her daughter, Chan announced that she was withdrawing from civic and political life.

==Personal life==
Among her seven siblings, twin sister Ninson ran a travel agency; brother Philip Fang Shun-sang (b. 1941) worked as a Chinese interpreter at the United Nations in Geneva until 1999 (and died in 2013 after jumping from his home in Lantau). Another brother, David Fang Jin-sheng, was a former orthopaedics lecturer and head of the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine; and another brother, John Fang Meng-sang, is a lawyer. In 2006, John became embroiled in a controversy over the death of his former lover in mysterious circumstances in a flat owned by him in 1995. A coroner&#x27;s inquest unanimously ruled her death accidental or by misadventure.

She was married to Archibald (&quot;Archie&quot;) Chan Tai-wing from 1963 until his death in 2010. Six years her senior, Archibald was a director of Caltex Oil and taught science at St Joseph&#x27;s College, his alma mater. He was also in the Hong Kong Auxiliary Police from 1987 to 1996, when he retired as a commandant.

The couple had two children, son Andrew Chan Hung-wai and daughter Michelle Chan Wai-ling (who died in 2020, aged 57), and four grandchildren.

On 25 June 2020, she announced that she would retire from political and civic life. In a public statement, she said that she has long promised her children that she would step back from &quot;civic and political engagement and lead a quieter life&quot;. The death of her daughter in May 2020 was a driving factor for her retirement because she wanted some &quot;time and space to mourn and recover&quot; and that she wanted to spend as much time with her family, particularly with her granddaughters and son-in-law. Her statement ends with her urging the young people of Hong Kong not to lose hope for the future and to &quot;continue to hold fast to the values that underpins our unique city but to do so in a law abiding and peaceful manner&quot;.

==Honours==
In recognition of her 34 years of public service to the British Crown, Chan was awarded the Hong Kong Grand Bauhinia Medal in 1999.

She was then appointed by Queen Elizabeth II as Honorary Dame Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 2002 in recognition of her service with the Hong Kong government before the handover. Such award was usually given only to Governors of Hong Kong before the transfer of sovereignty.

She is an honorary fellow of SOAS University of London.

In recognition of her commitment to democracy and the empowerment of women, and her service as Patron of the university, Asian University for Women conferred upon Anson Chan an honorary doctorate degree on 20 May 2017.

<text>Arsène Houssaye (28 March 181526 February 1896) was a French novelist, poet and man of letters. His 1879 book &quot;Des destinées de l&#x27;âme&quot; is notable for having been bound in human skin.

==Biography==

Houssaye was born in Bruyères (Aisne), near Laon; his original surname was Housset.

In 1832 he found his way to Paris, and in 1836 he published two novels, &quot;La Couronne de bleuets&quot; and &quot;La Pécheresse&quot;. He had many friends in Paris, among them Jules Janin and Théophile Gautier, and he wrote in collaboration with Jules Sandeau. He produced art criticism in &quot;L&#x27;Histoire de la peinture flamande et hollandaise&quot; (1846); semi-historical sketches in &quot;Mlle de la Vallière et Mme de Montespan&quot; (1860) and &quot;Galerie de portraits du XVIII siècle&quot; (1844); literary criticism in &quot;Le Roi Voltaire&quot; (1858) and his famous satirical &quot;Histoire du quarante et unième fauteuil de l&#x27;Académie française&quot;, dealing with notables who failed of election to the French Academy (1855); drama in his &quot;Comédiennes&quot; (1857); poetry in his &quot;Symphonie de vingt ans&quot; (1867), &quot;Cent et un sonnets&quot; (1873), etc.; and novels, &quot;Les Filles d&#x27;Eve&quot; (1852) and many others. He was long editor of &quot;L&#x27;Artiste&quot; and for some years was editor and proprietor of &quot;La Presse&quot;.

In 1849, through the influence of the actress Rachel, he was entrusted with the administration of the Theâtre Français, a position he filled with unfailing tact and success until 1859, when he was made inspector general of fine art.

In 1863, when excavating the site of the chapel of Saint-Florentin at the Chateau d&#x27;Amboise in the Loire Valley, he found a partially-complete skeleton and stone fragments bearing the inscription &#x27;EO [...] DUS VINC&#x27;. The unusually large skull led Houssaye to conclude he had located the remains of Leonardo, which were re-interred in the chapel of Saint-Hubert at the same chateau. Reflecting doubts about the attribution, a plaque above the tomb states that the remains are only &quot;presumed&quot; to be those of Leonardo. In 2016, it was announced that DNA tests were to be conducted to investigate the veracity of the attribution, with results expected in 2019.

His &quot;Confessions, souvenirs d&#x27;un demi-siècle&quot; appeared in 1885–91. See also J. Lemaître, &quot;Arsène Houssaye&quot; (1897), with a bibliography.

He died in Paris. His son Henry was a noted historian.

<text>Eduardo Oscar Camaño ((; born 17 June 1946) is an Argentine Justicialist Party politician. He was in charge of the executive branch in a caretaker capacity, effectively acting as president, for two days between 31 December 2001, and 1 January 2002.

==Political career==
Camaño was Mayor of Quilmes Partido from 1987 to 1991. Until 2007 he sat in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies as a deputy elected in Buenos Aires Province. He served as majority leader of the lower house of the Argentine Congress from 2001, hence bringing him to the position of acting president. He became head of the executive branch because of the resignations of interim President Adolfo Rodríguez Saá and provisional Senate president Ramón Puerta.

In recent years he sat in the Federal Peronist block allied to Eduardo Duhalde, largely in opposition to then President Néstor Kirchner. In 2007, Camaño stood again for deputy, this time heading a list of anti-Kirchner Peronists in support of the presidential bid of dissident Peronist Roberto Lavagna. The list did badly and he faced a recount for the final place in the Chamber for the Province with Ricardo Cuccovillo of the Civic Coalition. Ultimately Cuccovillo was sworn in as deputy and Camaño lost his seat.

Camaño chaired the national council of the Justicialist Party, making him de facto party leader, alongside supporters of both Duhalde and Kirchner. In 2008, when Kirchner assumed the leadership of the Justicialist Party, Camaño was offered an executive position, the only ally of Lavagna to do so, in what had been seen as a chance to reconcile the different wings of Peronism.

<text>Henry Houssaye (also Henri) (24 February 184823 September 1911), was a French historian and academician.

==Biography==
Houssaye was born in Paris, the son of the novelist Arsène Houssaye. He distinguished himself in the Franco-Prussian War, and was subsequently an editor of the &quot;Journal des Débats&quot; and the &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot;. His early writings were devoted to classical antiquity, his knowledge drawn partly from visits to the actual Greek sites in 1868. He published successively &quot;Histoire d’Apelles&quot; (1867), a study on Greek art; &quot;L&#x27;Armée dans la Grèce antique&quot; (1867); &quot;Histoire d’Alcibiade et de la République athénienne, depuis la mort de Périclès jusqu’à l’avènement des trente tyrans&quot; (1873; received from the French Academy the prize established by Thiers); Papers on &quot;Le Nombre des citoyens d&#x27;Athènes au Vème siècle avant l’ère chrétienne&quot; (1882); &quot;La Loi agraire à Sparte&quot; (1884); &quot;Le premier siège de Paris, an 52 avant l’ère chrétienne&quot; (1876); and two volumes of miscellanies, &quot;Athènes, Rome, Paris, l&#x27;histoire et les mœurs&quot; (1879), and &quot;Aspasie, Cléopâtre, Théodora&quot; (6th ed. 1889).

The military history of Napoleon I then attracted him. His first volume on this subject, &quot;1814, Histoire de la Campagne de France et la Chute de l&#x27;Empire&quot; (1888), went through no fewer than 46 editions. It was followed by &quot;1815&quot;, the first part of which comprises the first Restoration, the return from Elba and the Hundred Days (1893); the second part, Waterloo (1899); and the third part, the second abdication and the White Terror (1905). He was elected a member of the Académie française in 1895.

He died in Paris.

<text>Adolfo Rodríguez-Saá (; born 25 July 1947) is an Argentine Peronist politician. Born in a family that was highly influential in the history of the San Luis Province, he became the province&#x27;s governor in 1983, after the end of the National Reorganization Process military dictatorship. He remained governor up to 2001, being re-elected in successive elections.

President Fernando de la Rúa resigned in that year, amid the December 2001 riots, and the Congress elected Rodríguez Saá as the president of Argentina. In response to the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression, he declared the highest sovereign default in history and resigned days later amid civil unrest.

The Congress elected a new president, Eduardo Duhalde, in order to complete the term of office of de la Rúa (but Duhalde failed to do so, and eventually that term was completed by Néstor Kirchner, instead). Rodríguez Saá ran for President subsequently in the 2003 and 2015 presidential elections, but the low votes he received meant he was not among the serious contenders, receiving 14.11% of the popular vote in 2003 and merely 1.99% in 2015.

==Early life==

Rodríguez Saá was born to an important political family in San Luis. The Rodriguez Saá family is well known in the Province of San Luis and can be traced to the 19th century and to descendants of the federal &quot;caudillo&quot; Juan Saá, who fought in the battle of Pavón during the Argentine Civil War. Rodríguez Saá&#x27;s grandfather and namesake Adolfo Rodríguez Saá and his great-uncle were both governors of the province, and his father was the police chief.

He attended the &quot;Juan Pascual Pringles&quot; school, which was associated with the National University of Cuyo. He studied law at the University of Buenos Aires, graduating in 1971. He worked as a teacher in his former school for two years. He was an editor of the anti-Peronist pamphlet &quot;La voz de San Luis&quot; (), but became a Peronist in 1969 during his studies in Buenos Aires. He joined the Peronist Youth in the year of his graduation and worked as their representative in San Luis.

The Peronist party, proscribed since 1955, was allowed to run for the 1973 elections. The Peronist party won the elections, and Héctor Cámpora became president. Rodríguez Saá became a provincial legislator, and led the Peronist deputies in the chamber. He joined the right-wing Peronist unions, led by Oraldo Britos. He opposed the governor Elías Adre, who was aligned with left-wing Peronism. After the 1976 Argentine coup d&#x27;état, he left politics and worked in a law firm with his brother.

==Governor==
The National Reorganization Process dictatorship came to an end in 1983, when Raúl Alfonsín won the 1983 elections. Rodríguez Saá was elected governor of San Luis in those elections, in a close contest with the Radical Civic Union. He was helped by the clergy of the province, who opposed the radical candidate because of his secularism.

As a governor, Rodríguez Saá attracted huge investments to the province, which led to the growth of local industries, public works, social services and tourism. Levels of employment and industrial production, as well as measures of scholastic achievement and crime-fighting success were higher than those of the country at large. He was a populist and authoritarian governor who was accused of nepotism, corruption and restricting freedom of the press. He united the governors of the smaller Argentine provinces in a front, called &quot;Frente Federal Solidario&quot;.

He ran in the primary elections of the Justicialist Party (PJ) for the 1989 presidential elections. Carlos Menem, governor of La Rioja, prevailed in both the primary and the main elections and became the new president of Argentina. Rodríguez Saá was elected to the Constituent Assembly that drafted the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. He attempted to run in the primary elections for the 1995 presidential elections against Menem, who was seeking re-election. Not seeing any chance of prevailing against the president, he abandoned his candidacy. He also attempted to run in the primary elections for the 1999 presidential elections, and resigned his candidacy again, this time on behalf of Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the Buenos Aires Province. Duhalde lost the elections to the radical Fernando de la Rúa, and Rodríguez Saá was again re-elected as governor. He attempted to divide the city of San Luis into four municipalities, as the mayor was a political rival, but had to drop the project because of the popular unrest generated by the proposal.

==Presidency==
President Fernando de la Rúa resigned after the December 2001 riots that had been caused by the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression. As his vice president Carlos Álvarez had resigned as well months before, Congress called for a special assembly to designate a new president. Until then, Ramón Puerta served as acting president from 21 December to 22 December. Adolfo Rodríguez Saá became president after being elected with 169 votes to 138. He was supported by the PJ and smaller right-wing parties such as Republican Force and Action for the Republic. The &quot;Unión Cívica Radical&quot; (UCR) and Alternative for a Republic of Equals voted against him. He was replaced in the governor&#x27;s office by vice-governor María Alicia Lemme, and took office on 23 December 2001.

Rodríguez Saá got the mandate of president with instructions from the Assembly to call for elections the following 3 March, with a ballotage round on 17 March if needed. The new president would complete de la Rúa&#x27;s term of office. Those elections were to be held under the &quot;ley de lemas&quot; with double simultaneous voting, with the victor scheduled to take office on 5 April.

During his short time in office, Rodríguez Saá announced the creation of a new currency, the &quot;argentino&quot;, which would have circulated alongside the peso and the dollar. The civil unrest of previous days resurfaced when he announced his cabinet, as it included Carlos Grosso as Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers. Grosso was a very unpopular former mayor of Buenos Aires. As a result, Rodríguez Saá gave up his whole cabinet before they could take office, with the sole exception of Rodolfo Gabrielli, in the Interior Ministry. He also declared a sovereign default on the Argentine national debt, which was celebrated by the chamber of deputies. It was the highest sovereign default in history. Those measures, uncharacteristic of a president with a brief term of office, were resented by the leaders of the Justicialist party.

Rodríguez Saá prepared a budget bill for 2002, which was sent to the Congress. It included an important decrease in the deficits, as requested by Anne Krueger from the International Monetary Fund. Krueger also requested a new coparticipation law, to determine the way the nation and the provinces manage tax revenues. Rodríguez Saá called for a meeting with governors in Chapadmalal, but only six governors out of twenty-three attended: Carlos Ruckauf, Juan Carlos Romero, Gildo Insfrán, Ángel Mazza, Carlos Rovira and Alicia Lemme. José Manuel de la Sota, governor of Córdoba, withdrew his support, suspecting that Rodríguez Saá had plans to cancel the elections and stay as president up to 2003. On 30 December, he returned to San Luis with Daniel Scioli and resigned, alleging lack of support from the rest of the Justicialist Party. Insfrán, Maza and minister Rodolfo Gabrielli tried to convince him to stay as president; his brother Alberto Rodríguez Saá supported his decision. In announcing his resignation in a &quot;Cadena nacional&quot;, he recounted the achievements of his one-week administration and accused Justicialist governors and legislators of meanness and shortsightedness. He dispatched his resignation from San Luis to Buenos Aires, and the Congress accepted it on 1 January 2002. The Senate chairman Ramón Puerta would have been the interim president, but resigned as well, so Eduardo Camaño, president of the Chamber of Deputies, was appointed interim president instead. After new deliberations, they elected Eduardo Duhalde as president, this time with a mandate that would fill the remaining time of de la Rúa&#x27;s mandate.

==Post-presidency==
After the end of Eduardo Duhalde&#x27;s term, Rodríguez Saá ran for the presidency in the April 2003 elections. Those elections allowed the Lemas law, and the PJ did not provide an official candidate. Each precandidate was allowed instead to run for presidency on his own &quot;lema&quot;, and Rodríguez Saá did so. The other candidates of the PJ were Néstor Kirchner and Carlos Menem. Rodríguez Saá came in fourth, with 14.1% of the vote, behind both of the other PJ candidates and Ricardo López Murphy. Kirchner became the president of Argentina after those elections.

Rodríguez Saá&#x27;s brother Alberto Rodríguez Saá became the new governor of San Luis in 2003. Together with Carlos Menem, they attempted to create an alternative political group against Kirchner within the PJ. Adolfo Rodríguez Saá was elected Senator for San Luis representing this group at the 2005 election. He was reelected in 2011, with a term of office up to 2017. He tried to run for governor of Buenos Aires Province in 2011, but the local judiciary did not allow him, as he did not have the required time living in the province. The mayor Sergio Massa organized the coalition United for a New Alternative to run for the 2015 presidential election and invited Rodríguez Saá to join, but he refused to join and ran with his own party, Federal Commitment. With 1.64% of the vote, it was the least voted party in the national elections. He later joined the Juntos por el Cambio of the then-President Mauricio Macri in June 2019 but left the coalition and joined the Frente de Todos of President Cristina Kirchner in December 2019.

==Personal life==
Adolfo Rodríguez Saá was kidnapped on 21 October 1993. He was governor of San Luis at the time. He was taken to a room in the hotel &quot;Y no C&quot; and forced to perform for a pornographic video. He was forced to pay a ransom of 3 million dollars and was left in the trunk of a car. The video has never been made public, and the kidnappers Walter Alejandro Salgado, Nélida Esther Sesín and Eduardo Alberto Doyhenard were sentenced in 1995. The trial took 11 days, and it included the testimonies of 132 witnesses. It was aired on live television. Esther Sesín claimed during the trial that she had been his lover for eight years. All the kidnappers have served their sentences and currently live in other provinces.

Rodríguez Saá has worked as a cattle rancher in San Luis since his defeat in the 2003 elections.

<text>Federico Ramón Puerta (; born 9 September 1951) is an Argentine Peronist politician who has served as a governor, national senator and deputy and briefly as President of Argentina in 2001.

==Biography==

Puerta was born in Apóstoles, Misiones Province. He attended the Universidad Católica Argentina in Buenos Aires and qualified as a civil engineer. However, he entered the family business of the cultivation of yerba maté, and became a successful businessman and millionaire.

Puerta was elected a national deputy for Misiones in 1987. In 1991, he was elected Governor of Misiones Province, re-elected in 1995 and served until 1999. He followed the neo-liberal economic model of President Carlos Menem, including privatising the provincial bank of which his own grandfather had been a founder.

In 1999, he was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies and in 2001 he was elected to the Senate. In November of that year, he was elected provisory president of the Argentine Senate, constitutionally third in line to the nation&#x27;s presidency.

Puerta served as the acting head of the executive branch of the country for two days on 21–22 December 2001. He came to that position in his capacity as President Pro Tempore of the Senate and, as there was no vice president, he was next in line to the nation&#x27;s highest office when President Fernando de la Rúa resigned amid rioting. A week after giving up the presidency, Puerta resigned as leader of the Senate in order to avoid retaking the presidency, following a second institutional crisis.

Puerta stood to be Governor of Misiones in 2003, but lost to his successor, Carlos Rovira. He retired from the Senate in 2005. He ran for governor of Misiones again in 2007, and was defeated in the October election, coming in third place with 15% of the vote.

==Personal life==
Puerta is unmarried and has two children.

<text>Fernando de la Rúa (15 September 19379 July 2019) served as the President of Argentina from 1999 until his resignation in 2001. A member of the Radical Civic Union, he previously served as national senator for Buenos Aires across non-consecutive terms from 1973 to 1996, national deputy for Buenos Aires from 1991 to 1992, the first Chief of Government of Buenos Aires between 1996 and 1999, and President of the National Committee of the Radical Civic Union from 1997 to 1999.

De la Rúa was born in Córdoba, and entered politics after graduating with a degree in law. He was elected senator in 1973 and unsuccessfully ran for the office of Vice President as Ricardo Balbín&#x27;s running mate the same year. He was re-elected senator in 1983 and 1993, and as deputy in 1991. He unsuccessfully opposed the pact of Olivos between President Carlos Menem and party leader Raúl Alfonsín, which enabled the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution and the re-election of Menem in 1995. He later became the first chief of government of Buenos Aires to be elected by popular vote, a change introduced by the amendment of the Constitution. He expanded the Buenos Aires Underground, adding new stations to Line D, starting the expansion of Line B, and establishing Line H. He established Roberto Goyeneche Avenue and the city&#x27;s first bicycle path.

De la Rúa was elected President in the 1999 general election, after running on the Alliance ticket, a political coalition of the UCR and the Frepaso. He was opposed by the Peronist unions and his Vice President Carlos Álvarez resigned after denouncing bribes in the Senate. The economic crisis that began during Menem&#x27;s administration worsened and by the end of 2001 led to a banking panic. The government established the &quot;Corralito&quot; to limit bank withdrawals. De la Rúa called a state of emergency during the December 2001 riots. Following his resignation on 20 December, the Argentine Congress appointed a new president. After leaving office, De la Rúa retired from politics and faced legal proceedings for much of the remainder of his life until his death in 2019.

==Early life==
Fernando de la Rúa was the son of Eleonora Bruno and Antonio De la Rúa; he was born in the city of Córdoba and attended the local Military Lyceum before entering the National University of Córdoba, from which he graduated with a law degree at the age of 21. He married a Buenos Aires socialite, Inés Pertiné, in 1970; they had three children, including Antonio de la Rúa. De la Rúa became involved in politics at a young age; he entered public service in 1963 as an advisor to President Arturo Illia&#x27;s minister Juan Palmero.

He was elected senator in the March 1973 general elections, defeating the Peronist Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo. He was the only politician from the Radical Civic Union (UCR) who could defeat the Peronist candidate in his administrative division. The elected president Héctor José Cámpora and his vice president resigned a few months later, leading to the call to new elections. Ricardo Balbín ran for president in the September general elections, with De la Rúa as his running mate for the post of vice president. The UCR was defeated by Juan Perón in a landslide. De la Rúa was removed from the Congress during the 1976 Argentine coup d&#x27;état. He left politics and worked as a lawyer for the firm Bunge y Born.

The National Reorganization Process ended in 1983. De la Rúa intended to run for president but lost in the primary elections of the UCR to Raúl Alfonsín, who was elected in the general election. De la Rúa ran for the post of senator instead, defeating the Peronist Carlos Ruckauf. He ran for re-election as senator in 1989 but, despite his electoral victory, the electoral college voted for the Peronist Eduardo Vaca. De la Rúa was elected deputy in 1991 and returned to the senate in 1993. President Carlos Menem, elected in 1989, wanted to amend the constitution to allow him to run for re-election in 1995, which was opposed by the UCR. Alfonsín signed the Pact of Olivos with Menem, negotiating terms to support the proposal. De la Rúa led the opposition to the pact within the UCR, but Alfonsín prevailed in the internal dispute. This damaged the relationship between the two leaders, but helped the party to retain a number of radicals who were against the pact. De la Rúa could not prevent the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. As a result, Menem was re-elected in 1995. The UCR finished third in the elections for the first time, being surpassed by the Frepaso, a new party composed by former Peronists.

==Mayor of Buenos Aires==
The constitutional amendment gave autonomy to the city of Buenos Aires, allowing it to sanction local laws and elect its own mayor, who was previously appointed by the president of the nation. De la Rúa was the first mayor elected in this manner, defeating the previous mayor Jorge Domínguez. During his term of office he created or reformulated several institutions to fit the new status of the city, as required by the national constitution and the recently approved Constitution of Buenos Aires.

De la Rúa worked on the expansion of the Buenos Aires Underground. The first stations of the extended Line D, Olleros and José Hernández, were opened in 1997, Juramento was opened in 1999, and Congreso de Tucumán in 2000. He also started the works to extend the Line B. Carlos Menem started to transfer the control and financing of the underground system to the city, but the 2001 economic crisis halted the process.

The former mayor Domínguez intended to expand the Pan-American Highway into Saavedra, but the project met widespread opposition. De la Rúa reformulated the project and built an avenue instead of a highway, which was accepted. The avenue was named Roberto Goyeneche. He also restarted a project to build the Cámpora Highway linking Dellepiane Avenue with the Riachuelo, and established the first non-recreational bikeway in Buenos Aires at Avenida del Libertador.

==Presidential elections==
The Pact of Olivos diminished the electoral strength of the UCR, leading to the rise of the Frepaso. Both parties united in a political coalition, the Alliance, which defeated the PJ in the 1997 midterm elections. It was the PJ&#x27;s first national defeat since 1985. The parties held open primary elections for the 1999 presidential elections. De la Rúa stood for the UCR; the whole party, including Alfonsín, supported him. The Frepaso candidate was Graciela Fernández Meijide, who had defeated Peronism in the populous Buenos Aires province. De la Rúa won the primary elections by a wide margin. In the primaries, De la Rúa was voted for by more people than those who voted for the UCR in 1995. Despite his victory, Alfonsín was still the president of the UCR. They disagreed on the vice president for De la Rúa&#x27;s ticket; he thought that it should be Meijide because she took part in the primary elections and came from a different district than him. Alfonsín preferred the popular Carlos Álvarez, leader of the Frepaso, saying he could attract more voters and had more political expertise. It was also a result of the internal politics of the Alliance: except for Meijide, the Frepaso did not have a political figure who could run with high prospects for winning the post of Governor of the Buenos Aires province. Had she run for vice president, Frepaso would have had to resign that candidacy to a radical candidate.

Carlos Menem dismissed De la Rúa as a &quot;boring&quot; candidate. De la Rúa exploited that description in television advertisements, embracing it and setting a comparison with the glitzy style of Menem and the perceived political corruption of his administration. He also compared himself with the Peronist candidate Eduardo Duhalde. He promised to solve the economic crisis with fiscal austerity and higher tax controls, hoping it would lower interest rates, bring more foreign investments, and reduce unemployment. He also promised to keep the convertibility plan established by Menem that pegged the Argentine peso one-to-one with the United States dollar.

The 1999 presidential election was held on 24 October. De la Rúa defeated Duhalde by 48.4% to 38.3%, well ahead of the threshold to avoid a second round run-off election. Domingo Cavallo, Menem&#x27;s former minister of economy, finished the race in third place. De la Rúa was inaugurated President of Argentina on 10 December 1999. He took office with a favorability rating of 75%. Unlike Menem, whose initial cabinet was composed of trusted friends, De la Rúa&#x27;s cabinet included five people with international degrees and four economists.

==Presidency==
He was President of Argentina from 10 December 1999 to 21 December 2001. 
===Domestic policy===
In the first days of his presidency, De la Rúa sent a bill to the Congress to request a federal intervention in the province of Corrientes. The province had a high level of debt, and organizations of &quot;piqueteros&quot; blocked roads to make demonstrations. There were two interim governors disputing power. The bill was immediately approved. The intervenor selected for the task was Ramón Mestre.

The Peronist unions opposed De la Rúa and held seven general strikes against him. He sent a bill known as the labour flexibility law to deregulate labor conditions, attempting to reduce the political influence of unions, to the Congress. This project was opposed by the PJ and was changed from the original draft. It was finally approved but Álvarez said several legislators were bribed to support the bill. Álvarez asked for the removal of the labor minister , but De la Rúa instead promoted him to be his personal secretary. Álvarez resigned the following day and the political scandal divided the coalition. Several deputies who initially supported De la Rúa switched to the opposition. Alfonsín tried to prevent a breakup of the UCR. Some months later, it was proposed that Álvarez return to the De la Rúa government as the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers. Álvarez initially supported the idea but De la Rúa opposed it. Cavallo was also proposed for the office before he was appointed Minister of Economy. De la Rúa intended to include the Frepaso in the new cabinet but to exclude Álvarez himself because he still resented the latter&#x27;s resignation. The negotiations failed and the new cabinet included no Frepaso politicians, but the Alliance was still working as a coalition in the Congress. It also included several radical politicians from Alfonsín&#x27;s internal faction. The new Chief of Cabinet was Chrystian Colombo, who mediated between Alfonsín and the president.

The PJ won the 2001 midterm election by 40% to 24%, giving it a majority in both chambers of the Congress. However, the abstention rate and several forms of protest votes combined reached 41%, the highest in Argentine history, as a consequence of the popular discontent with the two main parties. Even the few candidates of the Alliance who won at their districts, such as the radical Rodolfo Terragno in Buenos Aires, did so with political platforms against De la Rúa&#x27;s administration.

===Foreign policy===
The first year of De la Rúa&#x27;s presidency coincided with the last year of Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency of the United States. Ricardo López Murphy, Minister of Defense at the time, met William Cohen, U.S. Secretary of Defense, in a summit of ministers that took place in Brazil in 2000. Both countries agreed to share classified information and to hold joint operations against terrorism.

George W. Bush took office as President of the United States in January 2001, and changed American policy towards countries in financial crises. His Treasury Secretary, Paul H. O&#x27;Neill, a critic of financial aid, said, &quot;We&#x27;re working to find a way to create a sustainable Argentina, not just one that continues to consume the money of the plumbers and carpenters in the United States who make $50,000 a year and wonder what in the world we&#x27;re doing with their money&quot;. The September 11 attacks occurred a few months later, and the U.S. focused its foreign policy on the War on Terror against countries suspected of harboring terrorist organizations. As a result, the U.S. gave no further financial aid to Argentina. This policy was confirmed after an interview of Bush with the Brazilian president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who confirmed Brazil would not be affected by the Argentine crisis.

Although Argentina maintained neutrality as for the conflict itself in Afghanistan to topple the Taliban rule, defense minister Horacio Jaunarena ordered the Argentine Air Force to prepare to deploy to Afghanistan under UN humanitarian mission &quot;after the war was over&quot; with military personnel returning from Kosovo. The mission never materialized as the war extended in time beyond de la Rúa&#x27;s term.

===Economic policy===
De la Rúa&#x27;s first Minister of Economy was the progressive José Luis Machinea, who was proposed by Alfonsín and Álvarez. Menem had left a deficit of 5 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) points that Machinea tried to compensate with higher taxes to people with the highest incomes, and a reduction of the highest retirement pensions. The deficit was reduced but the crisis continued. The scandal over the labor law and the resignation of Álvarez increased the country&#x27;s risk, and made Argentina&#x27;s access to international credit more difficult. The government negotiated a US$38 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) line of credit to prevent a default and allow the economy to grow again. Machinea also proposed appointing former minister Cavallo as the new President of the Central Bank of Argentina. However, Machinea was unable to achieve the levels of austerity negotiated with the IMF and resigned a few days later. The Minister of Defense Ricardo López Murphy became the new Minister of Economy. During the election camapain, De la Rúa had promised not to appoint him to that ministry, but with the ongoing crisis he did not want to risk problems caused by a temporary lack of minister. López Murphy announced a stricter austerity plan, with reduction to the health and education budgets. His plan was rejected by street demonstrations and the Frepaso, so De la Rúa declined it. Murphy resigned after being minister for 16 days.

De la Rúa appointed Cavallo, who had served under Menem and had established the convertibility plan. He was supported by the PJ, Carlos Álvarez, and the financial groups, but he was rejected by the rest of the UCR. The government announced it would retain the convertibility plan and that there would be no devaluation or sovereign default. Cavallo proposed several bills; De la Rúa sent them to the Congress and they were approved. The &quot;superpowers law&quot; authorized the chief of government to modify the national budget without the intervention of the Congress. There was a new tax on bank operations and more products attracted value-added tax. The wages of national customs workers were increased and some industries benefited from tax exemptions. The Megacanje was a negotiation to delay the payment of foreign debt in exchange for higher interest rates. However, internal debt was still a problem because the provinces, especially Buenos Aires, were nearing default. This led to conflicts between Cavallo and the provincial governors. Congress approved a bill for a &quot;Zero deficit&quot; policy to prevent further increases of debt and to work only with money from tax revenue. There was a banking panic in November; the government reacted by introducing the &quot;corralito&quot;, which prevented people from withdrawing cash from banks. It was initially a temporary measure. The IMF refused to send the monthly payment for the line of credit approved at the beginning of the year because the government had not stuck to the &quot;zero deficit&quot; policy.

===Riots and resignation===

The crisis worsened and by 19 December 2001, riots and looting broke out at several points in the country. De la Rúa announced in a &quot;cadena nacional&quot; (national network broadcast) that he had established a state of emergency. The riots continued; his speech was followed by increased protests, the &quot;cacerolazos&quot;, which caused 27 deaths and thousands of injuries. Cavallo resigned at midnight the same day, and the rest of the cabinet followed suit.

There was increased looting on 20 December, both in Buenos Aires and the Conurbano. The &quot;cacerolazos&quot; continued; large groups of people started demonstrations calling for the government&#x27;s resignation. The unions—first the CTA and then the CGT—began general strikes against the state of emergency. Most of the UCR withdrew their support for De la Rúa, so he asked the PJ to create a government coalition. The PJ refused, and De la Rúa resigned from government. His last administrative action was to lift the state of emergency. He gave his resignation to Congress on 20 December 2001 and left the Casa Rosada by helicopter as protesters blocked streets. He had presided for two years, half of his allotted term of office.

Because Vice President Carlos Álvarez had already resigned, the Congress convened to appoint a new president. Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, governor of San Luis Province, was in office for two months while calling for new presidential elections. Renewed demonstrations forced him to resign as well, and Eduardo Duhalde was appointed as the new president. He was able to complete De la Rúa&#x27;s term of office.

==Later life and death==

De la Rúa retired from political life after his resignation. The scandal over the labor flexibility law was renewed in 2003 when a former Senate worker, Mario Pontaquarto, claimed to be a witness of the case who delivered $5,000,000 to the legislators. De la Rúa was indicted alongside seven politicians from both the UCR and the PJ. In 2013, they were all cleared of charges by a unanimous resolution, and Pontaquarto was removed from the witness protection program.

De la Rúa was also indicted for the police repression which took place during the crisis; he was tried by judge Claudio Bonadio, who in 2009 declared him innocent. The Supreme Court overturned Bonadio&#x27;s ruling and ordered him to further investigate the matter. De la Rúa and Cavallo were indicted for illegally benefiting the banks that took part in the Megacanje. They were declared innocent on 6 October 2014.

He died of heart failure on 9 July 2019 at age 81. He received a state funeral in Congress before a private burial the following day.

==Public image==
De la Rúa started to work in politics from a very young age. He was nicknamed &quot;Chupete&quot; () because of this; the nickname was still employed when he grew up. During Carlos Menem&#x27;s administration he was perceived as a serious and formal politician, in stark contrast with Menem&#x27;s style. De la Rúa took advantage of this perception during the electoral campaign of 1999. When he became president and the economic crisis worsened, he was perceived as a weak and tired man who was unable to react to the crisis. He was perceived as a man without leadership skills who could not make use of his presidential authority. De la Rúa thought that the parody of him by the television comedian Freddy Villarreal helped to establish that image. He sought to change his image by appearing on the television comedy show &quot;El show de Videomatch&quot;, but his appearance on the program backfired. He confused the names of the show and that of the host Marcelo Tinelli&#x27;s wife. After De la Rúa&#x27;s participation ended, Tinelli began to close the program; De la Rúa could be seen seeking an exit from the set in the background. The aforementioned popular image of De la Rúa was further magnified when he was hospitalized for peripheral artery disease caused by high blood cholesterol. Although it is a standard, simple medical intervention, the medic told the press De la Rúa suffered from arteriosclerosis, which is usually linked with a lack of speed and reflexes.

<text>Francisco Cabarrús, 1st Count of Cabarrús (1752–1810) was a Spanish-French adventurer and financier.

==Life==

===Early life===
He was born in Bayonne, France, where his father, Dominique Cabarrus Fourcade was a merchant and shipbuilder, linked to a saga of Basque sea-captains, whalers and adventurers, who settled in Capbreton (a town near Bayonne), coming from the Navarre region of Spain.

Francois was sent to study in Toulouse but was recalled to Bayonne by his family due to certain amorous adventures and was sent by his father to Spain to practice with one of his business correspondents, named Galabert. He not only learned the business, but also fell in love and married Maria Antonia Galabert Casanova, his employer&#x27;s daughter. They settled in the town of Carabanchel Alto near Madrid, where Maria Antonia&#x27;s grandfather had a soap factory. Their mansion in Carabanchel was named Maison St. Pierre (in French) and many years later this mansion and the lands surrounding it were incorporated into the Manor lands of the Count of Montijo (father of the Empress Eugenia de Montijo). However, he soon began to take an active interest in public matters of the court in nearby Madrid.

The Age of Enlightenment had reached Madrid, and King Charles III, was favourable to reforms advocated by a circle of politicians, including Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, Count Campomanes, Count Floridablanca, Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolea (Count of Aranda). Among these Cabarrus became conspicuous, especially in finance.

===Reforms and disgrace===
He originated a bank, the &quot;Banco de San Carlos&quot; – which is the precursor of today&#x27;s Bank of Spain, a company to trade with the South American colonies and with Asia through the Philippine Islands – the Real Compañía de Filipinas, and an agricultural and hydraulic project known as the &quot;Canal de Cabarrus&quot; which is the origin of today&#x27;s Canal de Isabel II, supplying the water to the city of Madrid, in the northeast of the Madrid Community – in the course of the Jarama and within the municipal boundaries of the towns of Torrelaguna, Patones, Torremocha del Jarama, Uceda and Caraquiz. He was also involved in at least two other projects involved in the opening of navigable waterways which were never completed. One was the Canal del Guadarrama which was supposed to open a navigable waterway from Madrid to the Ocean linking several river basins from the Guadarrama River up to the Guadalquivir River and from there to the sea (several ruins of these canals are still visible in the Guadarrama River basin area). The other project involved the widening of the LLobregat River in the province of Barcelona in Catalonia in order to open up the Llobregat River valley to shipping and thus give impulse to the future industrial region of Catalonia with all the textile and mining projects of the region. 
He counted on the Lemaur brothers for the technical part of the projects. 
He also probably took note of the Canal du Midi and the Canal del Languedoc, built about a century earlier in France which had given the French such good results by making available a navigable waterway from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean without having to navigate around Spain and avoiding the Strait of Gibraltar. The impulsor of the Canal del Lanquedoc was Pierre Paul Riquet, Count of Caraman and great-grandfather of Joseph Riquet, also Count of Caraman and later Prince of Chimay, and the last husband of Teresa Cabarrus Galabert. 
The family relationship between several members of the Cabarrus family and the Lesseps family (also originary from Bayonne), one of whose most notable members was Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez Canal probably also influenced in this canal building impulse.

As one of the most influential members of the council of finance, he had planned many reforms in that department. When Charles III died (1788), and the reactionary administration of Charles IV put a stop to Enlightenment reforms, the men who had taken an active part in reform were suspected and prosecuted. Cabarrus himself was accused of embezzlement and thrown into prison in the Castle of Batres, a town near Madrid.

===Under French domination===
After two years he was released, created a count and employed in stately missions – he would even have been sent to Paris as Spanish ambassador, had not the French Directory objected to him as being of French birth.

Cabarrus took no part in the maneuvers through which Charles IV was obliged to abdicate and make way for Joseph Bonaparte (as King Jose I of Spain), brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, but his French birth and intimate knowledge of Spanish affairs recommended him to the emperor as the fittest person for the difficult post of minister of finance, which he held at his death. 
He died in Seville while on a trip accompanying Joseph Bonaparte and is buried in the Cathedral of Seville.

===Legacy===

Due to the support he had given Joseph Bonaparte during his short reign in Spain, he was considered an &quot;afrancesado&quot; and, although he had already died, when Ferdinand VII recovered the throne, his family was persecuted and his fortune and holdings were confiscated. There is even a rumor that states that his remains were removed from his tomb in the Cathedral of Seville and thrown into the Guadalquivir. With all of the political turmoil of the following period, the heritage he left his heirs was restored and confiscated several times depending on who would be governing in Madrid.

His son, heir and second &quot;Conde de Cabarrus&quot;, Domingo Cabarrús Galabert, held several positions in government and was governor of the provinces of Palencia and Valladolid among other official posts. 
His daughter, Teresa Cabarrus Galabert, Thérèse Tallien, also Madamme Tallien (afterwards Countess of Caraman and Princess of Chimay), played a part in the later stages of the French Revolution, being named as Notre Dame de Buon Secours and Notre Dame de Thermidor by her contemporaries.
One of his grandsons Domingo Cabarrus Quilty married Enriqueta Kirkpatrick y Grivegnée, sister of Manuela Kirkpatrick y Grivegnée, mother of Empress Eugenia de Montijo who married Emperor Napoleon III of France, and of the Duquesa de Alba. 
Domingo Cabarrus Quilty died before his father, Domingo Cabarrus Galabert and therefore did not become the third Count of Cabarrus, title that was inherited by his daughter, Paulina Cabarrus Kirkpatrick, as third Countess of Cabarrus.

Francisco Cabarrus Lalanne also acquired the title of Viscount of Rabouilhet from Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolea, Count of Aranda, originally for his other son, Francisco Cabarrus Galabert, but the early death of this son made him join both titles and up to today the present Counts of Cabarrus carry also the title of Viscounts of Rabouilhet. The town of Rabouilhet and its neighboring towns and countryside (also included in the title deed) are in the Lanquedoc region of France.
His close friend, Francisco Goya, painted a full body portrait of him. This portrait is currently exhibited in the Bank of Spain building in Madrid.

<doc id="339516" wikidata="Q1194869" url="?curid=339516" title="The Amazing Colossal Man">
<text>The Amazing Colossal Man (also known as The Colossal Man) is a 1957 American black-and-white science fiction film from American International Pictures. Produced and directed by Bert I. Gordon, it stars Glenn Langan, Cathy Downs, William Hudson, and Larry Thor. It is an uncredited adaptation of Homer Eon Flint&#x27;s 1928 short science fiction novel &quot;The Nth Man&quot;. AIP theatrically released it as a double feature with &quot;Cat Girl&quot;.

The film&#x27;s storyline concerns a U.S. Army Lt. Colonel who survives a plutonium explosion and grows 8 to 10 feet a day, ultimately reaching 60 feet tall, but loses his mind in the process.

During the 1960s, American International Television syndicated the film to television. It and its sequel, &quot;War of the Colossal Beast&quot; (1958), were mocked on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

==Plot==
At a military site in Desert Rock, Nevada, a test explosion of the first atomic plutonium bomb does not detonate as expected. When an unidentified civilian aircraft crash lands near the site, Lt. Colonel Glenn Manning runs into the detonation area to rescue the pilot. Once in the detonation area, the bomb goes off, and Glenn gets caught in the radioactive blast.

Surviving the blast but suffering from third-degree burns over almost his whole body, Glenn is treated by specialist Dr. Paul Linstrom and military scientist Dr. Eric Coulter. Glenn&#x27;s fiancée, Carol Forrest, anxiously awaits a prognosis, but Linstrom refrains from telling her that Glenn is extremely unlikely to survive. The following day, Linstrom and Coulter are stunned to discover that Glenn&#x27;s burns have completely healed. That evening, Carol is not allowed to see him and learns the military moved Glenn to an army rehabilitation and research center in Summit, Nevada. She drives there and gets admitted entry. Upon entering his room, Carol faints in horror as Glenn has mutated into a giant about 16 feet tall.

The next day, Linstrom tells Carol that Glenn&#x27;s exposure to the plutonium blast caused his body&#x27;s cells to multiply at an accelerated rate, resulting in his abnormal growth. Linstrom admits that he and Coulter do not know if they can stop it and that if they do not, Glenn will keep growing until he dies. Awakening the day after, Glenn is initially frightened, then greatly disturbed. Carol sees him the following day to comfort him, but Glenn is now roughly 22 feet tall, distant, and depressed. While the public knows he survived the explosion, the military has kept the truth of his condition secret.
As Glenn reaches 30 feet tall, Linstrom recommends that Carol spend time with him. Despite her encouragement, Glenn is angry and bitter. Linstrom reveals that Glenn&#x27;s heart is growing at only half the rate of his body, and soon it will not be able to support his enormous size and weight. He warns Carol that Glenn&#x27;s sanity will decline before his heart finally explodes. That night, Carol tries to console Glenn, but he loses his temper and shouts at Carol to leave him alone.

The following morning, Glenn disappears as Coulter reports to Linstrom that he may have found a solution to Glenn&#x27;s growth. Led by Colonel Hallock, the military conducts a 10-mile-wide search for the now 50-foot-tall Glenn, but with no results. When Carol asks Linstrom if she can help in their search, he cautions Carol that Glenn may no longer recognize her. Coulter reveals that he has created a special syringe filled with a serum that will stop his growth.

Meanwhile, the local news relays that a &quot;giant man&quot; was spotted approaching Las Vegas. As the military heads there, Glenn, now over 60 feet tall and confused, is drawn to the Vegas Strip. He wreaks havoc on various casinos. When his behavior alarms the police, they begin firing at Glenn, enraging him. He destroys the Pioneer Club&#x27;s Vegas Vic sign, then heads toward Boulder Dam as army helicopters track his movements.

Linstrom, Carol, and Coulter attempt to intercept Hallock&#x27;s troops. After landing at the dam, Lindstrom uses a bullhorn to try reasoning with Glenn, who seems to listen. Coulter and Linstrom take the enormous syringe and plunge it into Glenn&#x27;s ankle. He removes it and angrily spears Coulter with it, killing him. Then Glenn grabs Carol and starts across the dam. Linstrom stops Hallock from attacking prematurely before he and Carol implore Glenn to release her. Though Glenn is disoriented, he complies. Once she&#x27;s free, Hallock orders his men to open fire, causing Glenn to tumble into the Colorado River to his apparent death.

==Cast==
==Production==
Jim Nicholson of American International Pictures had the rights to Homer Eon Flint&#x27;s novel &quot;The Nth Man&quot; (1928), about a man who was 10 miles high. Nicholson thought it could be adapted to cash in on the success of &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot; (released six months earlier in 1957) and originally announced Roger Corman as director. Charles B. Griffith was hired to adapt the novel, and he turned it into a comedy. Then Corman dropped out, and Bert I. Gordon was hired. Gordon worked on the script with Griffith, but the collaboration only lasted a day before Griffith quit. Instead, Griffith&#x27;s regular writing partner Mark Hanna stepped in.

Before Gordon became involved, the film was conceived with Dick Miller in mind for the lead. It was Gordon&#x27;s first film for AIP. Principal photography began late in June 1957. AIP&#x27;s special effects technician Paul Blaisdell designed and built all of the tiny-sized props used in the film. These props later appeared again in the film&#x27;s 1958 sequel &quot;War of the Colossal Beast&quot; via flashback footage.

==Reception and legacy==
Distributed by American International Pictures (AIP) in 1957, the film appeared at the top of a double bill with &quot;Cat Girl&quot;. Critical reviews were generally positive, with film reviewer Richard W. Nason at &quot;The New York Times&quot; commenting: &quot;... imaginative story premise&quot;. A similar review in &quot;Variety&quot;, noted: &quot;... Glenn Langan delivers persuasively ... Technical departments are well handled&quot;.

At the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 38% based on , with a weighted average rating of 5.4/10.

The film and its sequel were featured and riffed on the cult classic mocking series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;; actor Mike Nelson portrayed the title character twice in the mid-movie host sections of the series&#x27; season 3, episodes 9 and 19. On episode 9, the character seems more aggressive to Joel and the bots when the Satellite of Love hit him and nearly proceeds to attack the trio after Tom Servo unintentionally insulted Glenn before leaving when suffering from a brief heart attack, as portrayed in the film.

The film was parodied on Season 1, episode 2 of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; in 2005 when a large bald giant, wearing a sarong as a diaper, is struck in the crotch with a wrecking ball as he terrorizes a city, as part of the &quot;Ode to the Nut Shot&quot; sketch.

The trailer has also been shown in the film projected at the Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios restaurant, Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater.

<text>Raúl Ricardo Alfonsín (; 12 March 1927 – 31 March 2009) was an Argentine lawyer and statesman who served as President of Argentina from 10 December 1983 to 8 July 1989. He was the first democratically elected president after the 7-years National Reorganization Process. Ideologically, he identified as a radical and a social democrat, serving as the leader of the Radical Civic Union from 1983 to 1991, 1993 to 1995, 1999 to 2001, with his political approach being known as &quot;Alfonsinism&quot;.

Born in Chascomús, Buenos Aires Province, Alfonsín began his studies of law at the National University of La Plata and was a graduate of the University of Buenos Aires. He was affiliated with the Radical Civic Union (UCR), joining the faction of Ricardo Balbín after the party split. He was elected a deputy in the legislature of the Buenos Aires province in 1958, during the presidency of Arturo Frondizi, and a national deputy during the presidency of Arturo Umberto Illia. He opposed both sides of the Dirty War, and several times filed a writ of &quot;Habeas corpus&quot;, requesting the freedom of victims of forced disappearances, during the National Reorganization Process. He denounced the crimes of the military dictatorships of other countries and opposed the actions of both sides in the Falklands War as well. He became the leader of the UCR after Balbín&#x27;s death and was the Radical candidate for the presidency in the 1983 elections, which he won.

After becoming president, Alfonsín sent a bill to Congress to revoke the self-amnesty law established by the military. He established the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons to investigate the crimes committed by the military, which led to the Trial of the Juntas and resulted in the sentencing of the heads of the former regime. Discontent within the military led to the mutinies of the &quot;Carapintadas&quot;, leading him to appease them with the full stop law and the law of Due Obedience. He also had conflicts with the unions, which were controlled by the opposing Justicialist Party. He resolved the Beagle conflict, increased trade with Brazil, and proposed the creation of the Contadora support group to mediate between the United States and Nicaragua. He passed the first divorce law of Argentina. He initiated the Austral plan to improve the national economy, but that plan, as well as the Spring plan, failed. The resulting hyperinflation and riots led to his party&#x27;s defeat in the 1989 presidential elections, which was won by Peronist Carlos Menem.

Alfonsín continued as the leader of the UCR and opposed the presidency of Carlos Menem. He initiated the Pact of Olivos with Menem to negotiate the terms for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. Fernando de la Rúa led a faction of the UCR that opposed the pact, and eventually became president in 1999. Following de la Rúa&#x27;s resignation during the December 2001 riots, Alfonsín&#x27;s faction provided the support needed for the Peronist Eduardo Duhalde to be appointed president by the Congress. He died of lung cancer on 31 March 2009, at the age of 82, and was given a large state funeral.

== Early life and career ==

Raúl Alfonsín was born on 12 March 1927, in the city of Chascomús, 123 km (76 mi) south of Buenos Aires. His parents, who worked as shopkeepers, were Serafín Raúl Alfonsín Ochoa and Ana María Foulkes. His father was of Galician and German descent, and his mother was the daughter of Welsh immigrant Ricardo Foulkes and Falkland Islander María Elena Ford. Following his elementary schooling, Raúl Alfonsín enrolled at the General San Martín Military Lyceum. Although his father disliked the military, he thought that a military high school would have a similar quality to a private school without being as expensive. Alfonsín disliked the military as well, but this education helped him to understand the military mindset. He graduated after five years as a second lieutenant. He did not pursue a military career and began studying law instead. He began his studies at the National University of La Plata, and completed them at the University of Buenos Aires, graduating at the age of 23. He was not a successful lawyer, he was usually absent from his workplace and frequently in debt. He married María Lorenza Barreneche, whom he met in the 1940s at a masquerade ball, in 1949. They moved to Mendoza, La Plata, and returned to Chascomús. They had six sons, of whom only Ricardo Alfonsín would also follow a political career.

Alfonsín bought a local newspaper (&quot;El Imparcial&quot;). He joined the Radical Civic Union (UCR) in 1946, as a member of the Intransigent Renewal Movement, a faction of the party that opposed the incorporation of the UCR into the Democratic Union coalition. He was appointed president of the party committee in Chascomús in 1951 and was elected to the city council in 1954. He was detained for a brief time, during the reaction of the government of Juan Perón to the bombing of Plaza de Mayo. The &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot; ousted Perón from the national government; Alfonsín was again briefly detained and forced to leave his office in the city council. The UCR broke up into two parties: the Intransigent Radical Civic Union (UCRI), led by Arturo Frondizi, and the People&#x27;s Radical Civic Union (UCRP), led by Ricardo Balbín and Crisólogo Larralde. Alfonsín did not like the split but opted to follow the UCRP.

Alfonsín was elected deputy for the legislature of the Buenos Aires province in 1958, on the UCRP ticket, and was reelected in 1962. He moved to La Plata, the capital of the province, during his tenure. President Frondizi was ousted by a military coup on 29 March 1962, which also closed the provincial legislature. Alfonsín returned to Chascomús. The UCRP prevailed over the UCRI the following year, leading to the presidency of Arturo Umberto Illia. Alfonsín was elected a national deputy, and then vice president of the UCRP bloc in the congress. In 1963 he was appointed president of the party committee for the province of Buenos Aires. Still in his formative years, Alfonsín was still in low political offices and held no noteworthy role in the administrations of Frondizi and Illia.
Illia was deposed by a new military coup in June 1966, the &quot;Argentine Revolution&quot;. Alfonsín was detained while trying to hold a political rally in La Plata, and a second time when he tried to re-open the UCRP committee. He was forced to resign as a deputy in November 1966. He was detained a third time in 1968 after a political rally in La Plata. He also wrote opinion articles in newspapers, under the pseudonyms Alfonso Carrido Lura and Serafín Feijó. The Dirty War began during this time, as many guerrilla groups rejected both the right-wing military dictatorship and the civil governments, preferring instead a left-wing dictatorship aligned with the Soviet Union, as in the Cuban Revolution. Alfonsín clarified in his articles that he rejected both the military dictatorship and the guerrillas, asking instead for free elections. The UCRP became the UCR once more, and the UCRI was turned into the Intransigent Party. Alfonsín created the Movement for Renewal and Change within the UCR, to challenge Balbín&#x27;s leadership of the party. The military dictatorship finally called for free elections, allowing Peronism (which had been banned since 1955) to take part in them. Balbín defeated Alfonsín in the primary elections but lost in the main ones. Alfonsín was elected deputy once more.

Illia was invited in 1975 to a diplomatic mission to the Soviet Union; he declined and proposed Alfonsín instead. Upon his return, Alfonsín became one of the founding members of the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights. He served as the defense lawyer for Mario Roberto Santucho, leader of the ERP guerrillas, but only to carry out due process of law, and not because of a genuine desire to support him. The 1976 Argentine coup d&#x27;état against President Isabel Perón started the National Reorganization Process. Alfonsín filed several &quot;Habeas corpus&quot; motions, requesting the freedom of victims of forced disappearances. The UCR stayed silent over the disappearances, but Alfonsín urged the party to protest the kidnapping of senators Hipólito Yrigoyen (nephew of the former president of the same name) and Mario Anaya. He also visited other countries, denouncing those disappearances and violations of human rights. He established the magazine &quot;Propuesta y control&quot; in 1976, one of the few magazines that criticized the military dictatorship during its early stages. The magazine was published up to 1978. His editorials were collected in 1980 in the book &quot;La cuestión argentina&quot;. 

Alfonsín expressed opposition to the 1982 Falklands War, criticizing the deployment of troops by both sides during the conflict. He rejected the invasion of the islands, which he considered an inevitable logistic and diplomatic failure, being one of the few politicians who opposed the war from the start. He proposed an emergency government headed by Illia, with ministers from all political parties, who would call for a ceasefire with the British and call for elections. He reasoned that the British would be magnanimous in victory if negotiating the transition with a civilian government, that all Argentine parties would be involved with such negotiations, and provide greater guarantees. The proposal did not get enough support, as Peronist Deolindo Bittel proposed another post-war scenario: electing a prime minister selected by a committee of generals and politicians. In this scenario, the military would keep a veto power and would guide the new government for at least two years. This proposal implicitly intended to remove Bignone and appoint a figure akin to the late Juan Perón, but it did not get support either because the current context did not provide any such figure that would have both support from the military and from the population. Antonio Trocolli, former leader of the Radical Congress, rejected both proposals as impracticable. 

The Falklands Wars were lost, and the military lifted the ban on political activities on the promise to hold elections. This was a calculated move to make the politicians focus on internal infighting, instead of blaming the military for the defeat. The plan did not work as intended, as the political parties united in a &quot;ad hoc&quot; coalition, the &quot;Multipartidaria&quot;, that rejected the military attempt to control the new government and asked to speed up the elections, which were called for October 1983. The Movement for Renewal and Change organized the first political event in a stadium in the Buenos Aires suburbs. As Balbín had died in 1981, the UCR had no strong leadership at the time.

== Presidential campaign ==

Alfonsín disputed the leadership of the UCR with Carlos Contín, but was unable to pass though the complex internal regulations of the party. He made a new political rally at the Luna Park, with a success comparable to a United States presidential primary. This new rally convinced Contín, who also ambitioned to be president, that he had no chances fighting against Alfonsín in proper primary elections. Fernando de la Rúa, who would have run in the primary elections against him, declined his candidacy because of Alfonsín&#x27;s huge popularity. Antonio Trocolli, another precandidate, declined to run as well. Alfonsín was then appointed candidate of the UCR for the 1983 general elections, with Víctor Martínez as the candidate for the vice-presidency. The UCR proposed Alfonsín to run with De la Rúa as the candidate for the vice-presidency, to secure the conservative votes, but Alfonsín was confident to win the elections without help. 

The publicity was managed by David Ratto, who created the slogan &quot;Ahora Alfonsín&quot; (), and the gesture of shaking hands. His campaign used a non-confrontational approach, in stark contrast with the Peronist candidate for the governorship of the Buenos Aires province, Herminio Iglesias. Iglesias burned a coffin with the seals of the UCR on live television, which generated a political scandal. Both Iglesias and Ítalo Luder, the Peronist candidate for the presidency, saw a decrease in their public image as a result. A group of UCR supporters drew graffiti that praised Alfonsín manliness and mocked Luder as effeminate; Alfonsín ordered to remove the graffitis as soon as he knew about them. 

During the campaign, both parties made similar proposals to reduce authoritarianism and the political influence of the military, and to maintain the Argentine claim in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. Alfonsín denounced a pact between the military and the Peronist unions that sought an amnesty for the military. He maintained that the armed forces should be subject to the civilian government and that unions should be regulated. He also proposed an investigation into the actions of the military during the Dirty War. He closed his campaign by reading the preamble of the constitution of Argentina. The last rally was at the &quot;Plaza de la República&quot;, and was attended by 400,000 people. Opinion polls placed the UCR behind the PJ, but also placed Alfonsín as the most popular politician at the time. 

The elections were held on 30 October. The Alfonsín–Martínez ticket won with 51.7% of the vote, followed by Luder–Bittel with 40.1%. It was the first time since the rise of Juan Domingo Perón that the Peronist party was defeated in elections without electoral fraud or proscription. The UCR won 128 seats in the Assembly, forming a majority; and 18 seats in the Senate, constituting a minority. 18 provinces elected radical governors and 17 elected governors from either the Justicialist or local parties. Alfonsín took office on 10 December and gave a speech from the Buenos Aires Cabildo.

== Presidency ==

=== First days ===

The presidential inauguration of Alfonsín was attended by Isabel Perón. Despite internal recriminations for the defeat, the Peronist party agreed to support Alfonsín as president, to prevent a return of the military. There were still factions in the military ambitious to keep an authoritarian government, and groups such as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo seeking reparations for the actions of the military during the Dirty War.

Three days after taking office, Alfonsín sent a bill to Congress to revoke the self-amnesty law established by the military. This made it possible for the judiciary to investigate the crimes committed during the Dirty War. During the campaign, Alfonsín had promised that he would do this while Luder had been non-committal. Alfonsín also ordered the initiation of judicial cases against guerrilla leaders Mario Firmenich, Fernando Vaca Narvaja, Ricardo Obregón Cano, Rodolfo Galimberti, Roberto Perdía, Héctor Pardo and Enrique Gorriarán Merlo; and military leaders Jorge Videla, Emilio Massera, Orlando Agosti, Roberto Viola, Armando Lambruschini, Omar Graffigna, Leopoldo Galtieri, Jorge Anaya and Basilio Lami Dozo. He also requested the extradition of guerrilla leaders who were living abroad.

Most of the first cabinet, organized in Chascomús, was composed of trusted colleagues of Alfonsín. Alfonsín appointed as minister of labor Antonio Mucci, who belonged to a faction of the UCR that sought to reduce the influence of Peronism among labor unions, and promptly sent a bill to Congress designed to promote independent unions. Facing an economic crisis, he appointed Bernardo Grinspun as minister of the economy. He appointed Aldo Neri minister of health, Dante Caputo minister of foreign relations, Antonio Tróccoli minister of interior affairs, Roque Carranza minister of public works, Carlos Alconada Aramburu minister of education, and Raúl Borrás minister of defense. Juan Carlos Pugliese led the chamber of deputies, and Edison Otero was the provisional president of the senate. Many presidential negotiations took place at the Quinta de Olivos, the official residence of the president, rather than at the Casa Rosada.

=== Aftermath of the Dirty War ===

The priority of Raúl Alfonsín was to consolidate democracy, incorporate the armed forces into their standard role in a civilian government, and prevent further military coups. Alfonsín first tried to reduce the political power of the military with budget cuts, reductions of military personnel and changing their political tasks. As for the crimes committed during the Dirty War, Alfonsín was willing to respect the command responsibility and accept the &quot;superior orders&quot; defense for the military of lower ranks, as long as the Junta leaders were sentenced under military justice. This project was resisted by human rights organizations such as Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo and public opinion, as it was expected that the defendants would be acquitted or receive low sentences. The military considered that the Dirty War was legally sanctioned, and considered the prosecutions to be unjustified. Alfonsín also established the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP), composed of several well-known personalities, to document cases of forced disappearances, human rights violations and abduction of children. Alfonsín sent a military code bill to Congress so that the military would use it. In its &quot;Nunca más&quot; report (), the CONADEP revealed the wide scope of the crimes committed during the Dirty War, and how the Supreme Council of the military had supported the military&#x27;s actions against the guerrillas.

As a result, Alfonsín sponsored the Trial of the Juntas, in which, for the first time, the leaders of a military coup in Argentina were on trial. The first hearings began at the Supreme Court in April 1985 and lasted for the remainder of the year. In December, the tribunal handed down life sentences for Jorge Videla and former Navy Chief Emilio Massera, as well as 17-year sentences for Roberto Eduardo Viola. President Leopoldo Galtieri was acquitted of charges related to the repression, but he was court-martialed in May 1986 for malfeasance during the Falklands War. Ramón Camps received a 25-year sentence. The trials did not focus only on the military: Mario Firmenich was captured in Brazil in 1984 and extradited to Argentina. José López Rega was extradited from Miami in 1986, because of his links with the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance.

The military was supported by the families of the victims of subversion, a group created to counter the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. This group placed the blame for the Dirty War on the guerrillas but had few followers. The trials were followed by bomb attacks and rumors of military protests and even a possible coup. Alfonsín sought to appease the military by raising their budget. As that was not enough, he proposed the full stop law, to set a deadline for Dirty War-related prosecutions. The Congress approved the law, despite strong opposition from the public. Prosecutors rushed to start cases before the deadline, filing 487 charges against 300 officers, with 100 of them still in active service. Major Ernesto Barreiro refused to appear in court and started a mutiny in Córdoba. Lieutenant Colonel Aldo Rico started another mutiny at Campo de Mayo, supporting Barreiro. The rebels were called &quot;Carapintadas&quot; () because of their use of military camouflage. The CGT called a general strike in support of Alfonsín, and large masses rallied in the Plaza de Mayo to support the government. Alfonsín negotiated directly with the rebels and secured their surrender. He announced the end of the crisis from the balcony of the Casa Rosada. The mutineers eventually surrendered, but the government proceeded with the Law of Due Obedience to regulate the trials. However, the timing of both events was exploited by the military, and the opposition parties described the outcome as a surrender by Alfonsín.

Aldo Rico escaped from prison in January 1988 and started a new mutiny in a distant regiment in the northeast. This time, both the military support for the mutiny and the public outcry against it were minimal. The army attacked him, and Rico surrendered after a brief combat. Colonel Mohamed Alí Seineldín launched a new mutiny in late 1988. As in 1987, the mutineers were defeated and jailed, but the military was reluctant to open fire against them. Alfonsín&#x27;s goal of reconciling the military with the civil population failed, as the latter rejected the military&#x27;s complaints, and the military was focused on internal issues. The &quot;Movimiento Todos por la Patria&quot;, a small guerrilla army led by Enrique Gorriarán Merlo, staged the attack on the Regiment of La Tablada in 1989. The army killed many of its members and quickly defeated the uprising.

=== Relation with trade unions ===

During his tenure, Alfonsin clashed with labor unions in Argentina over economic reforms and trade liberalization policies. Peronism still controlled the labor unions, the most powerful ones in all of Latin America. The biggest one was the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). Alfonsín sought to reduce the Peronist influence over the unions, fearing that they may become a destabilizing force for the fledgling democracy. He rejected their custom of holding single-candidate internal elections, and deemed them totalitarian and not genuine representatives of the workforce. He proposed to change the laws for those internal elections, remove the union leaders appointed during the dictatorship, and elect new ones under the new laws. The CGT rejected the proposal as interventionist, and prompted Peronist politicians to vote against it. The law was approved by the Chamber of Deputies but failed to pass in the Senate by one vote. A second bill proposed simply a call to elections, without supervision from the government, which was approved. As a result, the unions remained Peronist.

The CGT was splintered into internal factions at the time. Lorenzo Miguel had close ties to the Justicialist party, and led &quot;the 62 organizations&quot; faction. Saúl Ubaldini was more confrontational, distrusted the politicians of the PJ, and was eventually appointed secretary general of the CGT. His lack of political ties allowed him to work as a mediator between the union factions. Carlos Alderete led a faction closer to Alfonsín, named &quot;the 15&quot; unions. The government sought to deepen the internal divisions between the unions by appointing Alderete as minister of labor and promoting legislation to benefit his faction. He was removed after the defeat in the 1987 midterm elections, but the government stayed on good terms with his faction.

Alfonsín kept a regulation from the dictatorship that allowed him to regulate the level of wages. He authorized wage increases every three months, to keep them up to the inflation rate. The CGT rejected this, and proposed instead that wages be determined by free negotiations. Alfonsín allowed strike actions, which were forbidden during the dictatorship, which gave the unions another way to expand their influence. There were thirteen general strikes and thousands of minor labor conflicts. However, unlike similar situations in the past, the CGT sided with Alfonsín during the military rebellions, and did not support the removal of a non-Peronist president. The conflicts were caused by high inflation, and the unions requested higher wages in response to it. The unions got the support of the non-unionized retirees, the church and left-wing factions. Popular support for the government allowed it to endure despite opposition from the unions.

=== Social policies ===
With the end of the military dictatorship, Alfonsín pursued cultural and educational policies aimed at reducing the authoritarian customs of several institutions and groups. He also promoted freedom of the press. Several intellectuals and scientists who had left the country in the previous decade returned, which benefited the universities. The University of Buenos Aires returned to the quality levels that it had in the 1960s. Many intellectuals became involved in politics as well, providing a cultural perspective to the political discourse. Both Alfonsín and the Peronist Antonio Cafiero benefited.

Divorce was legalized by a law passed in 1987. The church opposed it, but it had huge popular support that included even Catholic factions, who reasoned that marital separation already existed, and divorce simply made it explicit. The church opposed Alfonsín after that point. The church successfully exerted pressure to prevent the abolition of religious education. In line with the teachings of Pope John Paul II, the Church criticized what it perceived as an increase in drugs, terrorism, abortion, and pornography. Alfonsín also intended to decriminalize abortion but dropped the idea to prevent further clashes with the Church.

=== Foreign policy ===

Argentina had a tense relationship with the United Kingdom due to the recently concluded Falklands War. The British government had temporarily prohibited all foreign ships from entering the exclusion zone of the islands in 1986. Argentina organized air and marine patrols, as well as military maneuvers in Patagonia. However, this was not enough to placate the military hard-liners in Argentina. Alfonsín proposed the postponement of the sovereignty discussions, instead negotiating for a &quot;de jure&quot; cease of hostilities, with a reduction in the number of military forces and normalization of Argentina–United Kingdom relations. The United Kingdom did not trust the proposal, suspecting that it was a cover-up for sovereignty discussions.

The Beagle conflict was still an unresolved problem with Chile, despite the 1978 Papal mediation. The military, troubled by the trial of the juntas, called for rejection of the proposed agreement and a continuation of the country&#x27;s claim over the islands. Alfonsín called for a referendum to settle the dispute. Despite opposition from the military and the Justicialist party, who called for abstention, support for the resolution referendum reached 82%. The bill passed in the Senate by a single vote majority, as the PJ maintained its resistance. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina was signed the following year, ending the conflict. The human rights violations committed by the Chilean president Augusto Pinochet remained a contentious issue, as well as the revelation of Chilean assistance to British forces during the Falklands War. The Argentine church invited Pope John Paul II for a second visit to Argentina in 1987, to celebrate his successful mediation. He celebrated World Youth Day next to the Obelisk of Buenos Aires, and gave a mass at the Basilica of Our Lady of Luján.

Argentina allied with Brazil, Uruguay and Peru, three countries that had also recently ended their local military dictatorships, to mediate in the conflict between the United States and Nicaragua. They created the Contadora support group, to support the Contadora group from South America. Both groups negotiated together but ultimately failed because of the reluctance of both Nicaragua and the United States to change their positions. The group changed its scope later to discuss foreign debt and diplomacy with the United Kingdom concerning the Falklands conflict.

Initially, Alfonsín refused to foster diplomatic relations with the Brazilian military government, and only did so when the dictatorship ended and José Sarney became president. One of their initial concerns was to increase Argentine–Brazilian trade. Both presidents met in Foz do Iguaçu and issued a joint declaration about the peaceful use of nuclear power. A second meeting in Buenos Aires strengthened the trade agreements. Argentina and Brazil signed the Program of Integration and Economic Cooperation (PICE), and in 1988 both countries and Uruguay agreed to create a common market. This led to the 1991 Treaty of Asunción, that created the Mercosur.

Alfonsín was the first Argentine head of state to give an official visit to the USSR.

=== Economic policy ===

Alfonsín began his term with many economic problems. In the previous decade, the national economy had contracted by 15%. The foreign debt was nearly 43  billion dollars by the end of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7 billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have proven to be unpopular.

Initially, the government did not take any strong action to tackle the economic problems. Bernardo Grinspun, the first minister of the economy, arranged an increase in wages, reaching the levels of 1975. This caused inflation to reach 32%. He also tried to negotiate more favorable terms on the country&#x27;s foreign debt, but the negotiations failed. Risking a default, he negotiated with the IMF, which requested spending cuts. International credits prevented default at the end of 1984, but he resigned in March 1985 when the debt reached $1  billion and the IMF denied further credits. Grinspun was succeeded by Juan Vital Sourrouille, who designed the Austral plan in 1985. This plan froze prices and wages, stopped the printing of money, arranged spending cuts, and established a new currency, the Austral, worth 1 United States dollar. The plan was a success in the short term and choked inflation. However, most of the initial popularity of Alfonsín had declined by this point, and could not persuade many of the benefits of austerity for the long-term improvement of the economy. Inflation rose again by the end of the year, the CGT opposed the wage freeze, and the business community opposed the price freeze. Alfonsín thought that the privatization of some state assets and deregulation of the economy might work, but those proposals were opposed by both the PJ and his own party. The Austral plan was also undermined by populist economic policies held by the government. 

With the support of the World Bank, the government tried new measures in 1987, including an increase in taxes, privatizations, and a decrease in government spending. Those measures could not be enforced; the government had lost the 1987 midterm elections, &quot;the 15&quot; unions that had earlier supported the government distanced themselves from it, and the business community was unable to suggest a clear course of action. The PJ, aiming for a victory in the 1989 presidential elections, opposed the measures that it believed would have a negative social impact. The &quot;Spring plan&quot; sought to keep the economy stable until the elections by freezing prices and wages and reducing the federal deficit. This plan had an even worse reception than the Austral plan, and none of the parties supported it. The World Bank and the IMF refused to extend credits to Argentina. Big exporters refused to sell dollars to the Central Bank, which depleted its reserves. The austral was devaluated in February 1989, and the high inflation turned into hyperinflation. The US Dollar was worth 14 Australes by the beginning of 1989, and 17000 by May. The 1989 presidential elections took place during this crisis, and the Justicialist Carlos Menem became the new president.

=== Midterm elections ===
The actions taken against the military contributed to a strong showing by the UCR in the November 1985 legislative elections. They gained one seat in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Congress, which meant control of 130 of the 254 seats. The Justicialists lost eight seats (leaving 103) and smaller, provincial parties made up the difference. Alfonsín surprised observers in April 1986 by announcing the creation of a panel entrusted to plan a transfer of the nation&#x27;s capital to Viedma, a small coastal city 800 km (500 mi) south of Buenos Aires. This proposal was never implemented, as it was too expensive because Viedma lacked the required urban infrastructure. His proposals boldly called for constitutional amendments creating a Parliamentary system, including a prime minister, and were well received by the Chamber of Deputies, though they encountered strong opposition in the Senate.

The government suffered a big setback in the 1987 legislative election. The UCR lost the majority in the chamber of deputies. All provinces elected Peronist governors, except for Córdoba and Río Negro. Along with the city of Buenos Aires (a federal district at the time), they were the only districts where the UCR prevailed. As a result, the government could not move forward with its legislative agenda, and the PJ only supported minor projects. The PJ was strengthened for the 1989 presidential elections, and the UCR sought to propose governor Eduardo Angeloz as a candidate. Angeloz was a rival of Alfonsín within the party.

== Later years ==

Amid rampant inflation, Angeloz was heavily defeated by PJ candidate Carlos Menem in the 1989 election. By the winter of 1989, the inflation had grown so severe that Alfonsín transferred power to Menem on 8 July, five months earlier than scheduled.

Alfonsín stayed on as president of the UCR, leaving after the party&#x27;s defeat in the 1991 legislative elections. Suffering damage to its image because of the hyperinflation of 1989, the UCR lost in several districts. Alfonsín became president of the party again in 1993. He supported the creation of a special budget for the province of Buenos Aires, led by governor Eduardo Duhalde. The radical legislator Leopoldo Moreau supported the new budget even more vehemently than the Peronists. Both parties had an informal alliance in the province. Alfonsín also supported the amendment to the constitution of Buenos Aires that allowed Duhalde to run for re-election.

President Carlos Menem sought a constitutional amendment to allow his re-election, and Alfonsín opposed it. The victory in the 1993 midterm elections strengthened the PJ, which approved the bill in the Senate. Menem proposed a referendum on the amendment, to force the radical deputies to support it. He also proposed a bill for a law that would allow a constitutional amendment with a simple majority of the Congress. As a result, Alfonsín made the Pact of Olivos with him. With this agreement, the UCR would support Menem&#x27;s proposal, but with further amendments that would reduce presidential power. The Council of Magistracy of the Nation reduced the influence of the executive power over the judiciary, the city of Buenos Aires would become an autonomous territory allowed to elect its mayor, and the presidential term of office would be reduced to four years. The presidential elections would include the two-round system, and the electoral college would be abolished. Alfonsín was elected to the constituent assembly that worked for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. A faction of the UCR, led by Fernando de la Rúa, opposed the pact, but the party as a whole supported Alfonsín. The UCR got only 19% of the vote in the elections, attaining a third position in the 1995 presidential elections behind the Frepaso when Menem was re-elected. Alfonsín resigned the presidency of the party in that year.

The UCR and the Frepaso united as a political coalition, the Alliance for Work, Justice, and Education, led by Alfonsín, Fernando de la Rúa, and Rodolfo Terragno from the UCR, and Carlos Álvarez and Graciela Fernández Meijide from the Frepaso. The coalition won the 1997 legislative elections. Alfonsín did not agree with de la Rúa about the fixed exchange rate used by then. He thought that it had been a good measure in the past but had become detrimental to the Argentine economy, while de la Rúa supported it.

Alfonsín suffered a car crash in the Río Negro province in 1999, during the campaign for governor Pablo Verani. They were on Route 6, and he was ejected from the car because he was not wearing a seat belt. He was hospitalized for 39 days. De la Rúa became president in the 1999 elections, defeating the governor of Buenos Aires, Eduardo Duhalde. Alfonsín was elected Senator for Buenos Aires Province in October 2001. De la Rúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and the Congress appointed Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, who resigned as well. Alfonsín instructed the Radical legislators to support Duhalde as the new president. He also gave him two ministers, Horacio Jaunarena for Defense and Jorge Vanossi for Justice. The radical support helped Duhalde overcome the ambitions of Carlos Ruckauf and José Manuel de la Sota, who also had ambitions to be appointed president. Alfonsín&#x27;s health problems later in the year led him to step down, to be replaced by Diana Conti.

In 2006, Alfonsín supported a faction of the UCR that favored the idea of carrying an independent candidate for the 2007 presidential elections. The UCR, instead of fielding its own candidate, endorsed Roberto Lavagna, a center-left economist who presided over the recovery in the Argentine economy from 2002 until he parted ways with President Néstor Kirchner in December 2005. Unable to sway enough disaffected Kirchner supporters, Lavagna garnered third place. Alfonsín was honored by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner with a bust of his likeness at the Casa Rosada on 1 October 2008. This was his last public appearance.

== Death ==
Alfonsín died at home on 31 March 2009, at the age of 82, after being diagnosed a year before with lung cancer. The streets around his house at the Santa Fe avenue were filled with hundreds of people, who started a candlelight vigil. The radical Julio Cobos, Fernández de Kirchner&#x27;s vice president, was the acting president at the moment and ordered three days of national mourning. There was a ceremony in the Congress, where his body was displayed in the Blue Hall, that was attended by almost a thousand people. His widow María Lorenza Barreneche could not attend the funeral, because of her own poor health. It was attended by former presidents Carlos Menem, Fernando de la Rúa, Eduardo Duhalde and Néstor Kirchner, all the members of the Supreme Court of Argentina, mayor Mauricio Macri, governor Daniel Scioli, the president of Uruguay Tabaré Vázquez and several other politicians. The coffin was moved to La Recoleta Cemetery. He was placed next to the graves of other important historical figures of the UCR, such as Leandro N. Alem, Hipólito Yrigoyen and Arturo Illia.

At the international level, Perú set a day of national mourning, and Paraguay set three days. The governments of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Spain, Uruguay, and the United States sent messages of condolence. In addition to Tabaré Vázquez, Julio María Sanguinetti of Uruguay, and Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil attended the ceremony.

== Legacy ==

Historians Félix Luna, Miguel Angel de Marco, and Fernando Rocchi all praise the role of Raúl Alfonsín in the aftermath of the Dirty War and the restoration of democracy. Luna also considers that Alfonsín was an effective president and that he set an example of not using the state for personal profit. De Marco points out that it was a delicate time, and any mistake could have endangered the newly founded democracy and led to another coup. The aforementioned historians do not agree, though, on their view of the Pact of Olivos. Luna considers that it was a necessary evil to prevent the chaos that would have been generated if Menem managed to proceed with the constitutional amendment without negotiating with the UCR. De Marco and Rocchi instead believe that it was the biggest mistake of Alfonsín&#x27;s political career.

Alfonsín received the 1985 Princess of Asturias Award for international cooperation because of both his role in ending the Beagle dispute and his work to reestablish democracy in Argentina. He was named &quot;Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires Province&quot; in 2008, and &quot;Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires&quot; in 2009. The latter award was granted posthumously and received by his son Ricardo Alfonsín, ambassador to Spain.

<text>Reynaldo Benito Antonio Bignone (21 January 1928 – 7 March 2018) was an Argentine general who served as the &quot;de facto&quot; President of Argentina from 1 July 1982 to 10 December 1983, the last president to serve under the National Reorganization Process. In 2010, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in the kidnapping, torture, and murder of persons suspected of opposing the government during the Dirty War.

He was the dictator who ordered the destruction of all documentation on the disappeared. His only contribution to the rule of law was the handover of command to Raúl Alfonsín.

==Early life and family==
Bignone was born in 1928 in Morón, which today is part of the Greater Buenos Aires area. His parents were Adelaida María (née Ramayón), of Gibraltarian and French descent, and Reynaldo René Bignone, of Italian and German descent. 
He joined the Army Infantry at age 19. He studied at the Superior School of War and in Francoist Spain before being appointed head of the VI Infantry Regiment in 1964.

He was married to Nilda Raquel Belén Etcheverry, who died in 2013. The couple had three children.

==Presidency==

He was President of Argentina appointed by the military junta from July 1982 to December 1983, when democracy returned to Argentina.

===Political policy===
Uncomfortable with the media, Bignone&#x27;s press statements left doubts as to whether there would be an imminent call for elections.

His loosening of certain free speech restrictions also put his regime&#x27;s unpopularity in evidence and the newsstands brimmed with satirical publications. &quot;Humor&quot; had its January 1983 issue confiscated after Army Chief of Staff General Cristino Nicolaides, objected to caricaturist Andrés Cascioli&#x27;s portrayals of the junta.

===Economic policy===
Bignone chose Domingo Cavallo to head the Argentine Central Bank and Jose Maria Dagnino Pastore a liberal as Economy Minister. Cavallo inherited a foreign debt installment guarantee program that shielded billions of private debt from the collapse of the peso, costing the treasury billions. He instituted controls over the facility, such as the indexation of payments, but this move and the rescission of Circular 1050 threw the banking sector against him; Cavallo and Dagnino Pastore were replaced in August.

Bignone&#x27;s new president of the Central Bank, Julio González del Solar, undid many of these controls, transferring billions more in private foreign debt to the Central Bank, though he stopped short of reinstating the hated &quot;1050.&quot;

Six years of intermittent wage freezes had left real wages close to 40% lower than during Perón&#x27;s tenure, leading to growing labor unrest. Bignone&#x27;s decision to restore limited rights of speech and assembly, including the right to strike, led to increased strike activity. Saúl Ubaldini, the new leader of the reinstated CGT, Argentina&#x27;s largest labor union, was particularly active. Bignone&#x27;s new Economy Minister, Jorge Wehbe, a banking executive with previous experience in the post, reluctantly granted two large, mandatory wage increases in late 1982. On September 13, 1982, Economy Minister Jorge Wehbe launched a &quot;price controls&quot; that &quot;put the products of 675 companies under government control&quot; due to &quot;the need to &quot;protect real wages,&quot; threatened by a &quot;monopolistic industrial structure.&quot; Calls for immediate elections led, likewise, to frequent demonstrations at the President&#x27;s executive offices, the Casa Rosada. One such protest, on 16 December, led to the death of a demonstrator.

===Democratic way out===
Drawing a contrast between his position and the lukewarm reproach by others in his own party and in other parties, Raúl Alfonsín, the head of the centrist UCR&#x27;s progressive wing who had also opposed the Falklands War when few others in Argentina did, earned his party&#x27;s nomination in July. The convention was called only days after Bignone publicly announced the scheduling of elections (to be held on 30 October, three months after the announcement). The UCR&#x27;s only important opposition, the Justicialist (Peronist) Party, was hamstrung by voters&#x27; memories of President Isabel Perón&#x27;s two years in office and by internal friction that dragged their nominating process on by nearly two months.

The Argentine economy, which had recovered modestly following the July 1982 cancellation of prevailing wage freezes and the rescission of Circular 1050, was saddled with foreign debt interest payments of over US$4 billion, capital flight, budget deficits around 10% of GDP and a resulting rise in inflation: rising to 200% in 1982, it approached 400% in 1983. Economy Minister Jorge Wehbe released a new currency in June, the peso argentino, to replace the worthless peso ley at 10,000 to one. This move secured him concessions from international creditors, but did not slow inflation, and the economy slipped back into recession during the second half of 1983.

Careful to avoid the appearance of endorsement of any one candidate (a mistake made by a previous dictator, General Pedro Aramburu, in 1958), Bignone oversaw the shredding of documents and other face-saving measures, such as generous new wage guidelines. The economy, which had contracted by around 12% in the eighteen months before he took office, managed a recovery of around 4% during Bignone&#x27;s eighteen-month term. Following a brief, though intense campaign and tight polls, election night resulted in a 12-point margin for the UCR&#x27;s Alfonsín over Justicialist nominee Ítalo Lúder. Tied to repressive measures he signed in 1975, he could not avoid suspicion of a gentleman&#x27;s agreement with Bignone for the sake of preventing future investigations.

==Later life and death==

Presiding over a difficult six years, President Raúl Alfonsín advanced the Trial of the Juntas in 1985, proceedings which acquitted Bignone of responsibility, but left open the possibility of civil trials against him. These, however, were precluded by decrees signed by Alfonsín himself in early 1987, the result of pressure from the Armed Forces.

Bignone published a memoir about his brief tenure, &quot;El último de facto&quot; (2003). It was condemned for his marginalizing of Dirty War abuses. In January 1999, the courts reopened trials related to the taking of children from disappeared women and placing them in families with ties to the government. In 2003 people in Argentina were outraged by comments of Bignone and two other generals defending their actions during the Dirty War, expressed in the film documentary, &quot;Escadrons de la mort: l&#x27;ecole francaise&quot; (2003); this was directed by French journalist and filmmaker Marie-Monique Robin. President Nestor Kirchner &quot;ordered the military to bring charges against the three for justifying the crimes of the dictatorship.&quot;

Bignone was granted house arrest in October 2006, given his advanced age. He was arrested in March 2007 and taken into custody at a military base outside Buenos Aires as part of an investigation into past human rights abuses, including the atrocities at the Posadas Hospital and trafficking of infants born to and abducted from the roughly 500 pregnant women who were among the disappeared. These were ruled to have no statute of limitations owing their nature as crimes against humanity.

On 20 April 2010, Bignone was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his involvement in the kidnapping, torture and murder of 56 people, including guerrilla fighters, at the extermination center operating in the Campo de Mayo military complex.
On 14 April 2011, Bignone was sentenced to life in prison for crimes against humanity.

On 29 December 2011 Bignone received an additional 15-year prison sentence for crimes against humanity for setting up a secret torture center inside a hospital during the 1976 military coup. On 5 July 2012, Bignone was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his participation in a scheme to steal babies from parents detained by the military regime and place them with friends of the regime. According to the court decision, Bignone was an accomplice &quot;in the crimes of theft, retention and hiding of minors, as well as replacing their identities.&quot; On 27 May 2016, Bignone was convicted for his role in Operation Condor, which included the murders of 105 people, among them 45 Uruguayans, 22 Chileans, 13 Paraguayans and 11 Bolivians living in exile. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Bignone died of congestive heart failure in Buenos Aires on the morning of 7 March 2018 at the age of 90; he had recently been admitted to the military hospital with a hip fracture.

<text>The White Tower of Thessaloniki ( &quot;Lefkós Pýrgos&quot;; ; ) is a monument and museum on the waterfront of the city of Thessaloniki, capital of the region of Macedonia in northern Greece. The present tower replaced an old Byzantine fortification, known to have been mentioned around the 12th century, that the Ottoman Empire reconstructed to fortify the city&#x27;s fortress some time after Sultan Murad II captured Thessaloniki in 1430. During the period of Ottoman rule, the tower became a notorious prison and the scene of numerous mass executions, most famously of the Janissaries who revolted during the reign of Mahmud II.

In 1912, as Greece gained control over the city, and the White Tower was substantially remodeled and its exterior was whitewashed. The White Tower has been adopted as the symbol of the city.

==Physical attributes==
The White Tower takes the form of a cylindrical drum in diameter with a height of above ground level, on top of which is a turret in diameter and high. Some of the embrasures in the outer wall of the tower are reached by a spiral ramp; others are accessed from a central room on each of the six floors.

The turret houses a platform with a diameter of , and the platform at the top of the main tower in front of the turret is about wide.

==History==

=== Origins ===
The present tower likely replaced an older Byzantine tower mentioned by the 12th-century archbishop Eustathius of Thessalonica during the sack of the city in 1185. The present tower, which once guarded the eastern end of the city&#x27;s sea walls, was for many years attributed to Venice, to which the Byzantines ceded Thessaloniki in 1423. It is now known that the tower was constructed by the Ottomans sometime after the army of Sultan Murad II captured Thessaloniki in 1430. Until 1912, an inscription in Ottoman Turkish verse above the door attributes the tower&#x27;s construction to AH 942 (1535–1536) on the orders of Sultan Suleiman. 

The historian Franz Babinger speculated that the structure was designed by the Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, who is known to have built fortifications, including a similar tower at the Albanian port Valona in 1537. This dating is supported by historian Michel Kiel, though he states that Sinan&#x27;s involvement cannot be ascertained. Another study by French scholars estimates a date between 1450 and 1470, arguing that the 16th-century inscription refers only to an outer &quot;chemise&quot;.

===Modifications===
The Ottoman-built structure itself has been altered substantially over the years. Early illustrations show that it was originally covered by a conical roof, like similar towers in the Yedikule Fortress and Rumelihisarı fortress in Istanbul.

Until its demolition in 1917, a &quot;chemise&quot; stood at the foot of the tower, supporting the heavy guns and enclosing an area at least three times the diameter of the main tower. Octagonal turrets on the &quot;chemise&quot; and &quot;caponiers&quot; at ground level provided flanking fire around the tower. It is unclear whether the &quot;chemise&quot; was part of the original scheme for the tower or was a later addition.

The tower was for centuries part of the walls of the old city of Thessaloniki, separating the Jewish quarter of the city from the cemeteries of the Muslims and Jews. The city walls were demolished in 1866.

===From the Red Tower to the White Tower===

The Tower was used by the Ottomans successively as a fortress, garrison and a prison. In 1826, at the order of the Sultan Mahmud II, there was a massacre of the rebellious Janissaries imprisoned there. Owing to the &quot;countless victims of Ottoman torturers and executioners&quot;, the tower acquired the name &quot;&quot;Tower of Blood&quot; or &quot;Red Tower&quot;&quot; (), a name which it kept until the end of the 19th century.

The current name of The White Tower came to be in 1890, when the tower was whitewashed by a convict in exchange for his freedom. 
It has had many names over the centuries: &quot;Lions Tower&quot; in the 16th century, the &quot;Fortress of Kalamaria&quot; in the 18th century, the &quot;Janissary Tower&quot; and the &quot;Blood Tower&quot; in the 19th century as it served as a prison and place of execution for long term convicts. After the incorporation of Thessaloniki into Greece in 1912, the tower became the symbol of the city.

King George I of Greece was assassinated not far from the White Tower in March 1913.

The Tower is now a buff colour but has retained the name White Tower. It now stands on Thessaloniki&#x27;s waterfront boulevard, Nikis (Victory) Street. It houses a museum dedicated to the history of Thessaloniki and is one of the city&#x27;s leading tourist attractions.

==White Tower Museum==

The White Tower houses an exhibition dedicated to the city of Thessaloniki and its history throughout various periods, organized by the city&#x27;s Museum of Byzantine Culture. It is under the administration of the Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities of the Greek Ministry of Culture.

The Tower is open to the public, and visitors have the opportunity to view a map of the city with monuments and museums, a timeline with events relevant to Thessaloniki, scientific articles of distinguished historians and archaeologists, bibliography etc. School excursions may be arranged by contacting the Byzantine Museum.

==Depiction==
In the 1990s, the White Tower was depicted on various objects, including T-shirts and posters, in the Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia).

According to historian Donald Sassoon, banknotes depicting the White Tower were created by extreme nationalist organizations in the Republic of Macedonia. VMRO-DPMNE proposed the White Tower-depicting banknotes&#x27; official adoption. However, the government in Skopje rejected its official use and adopted a different design for the new denar, which was issued in 1992.

&quot;IMPRES&quot; printed unofficial banknotes depicting the White Tower, which were sold as souvenirs on the streets of Skopje, bearing the disclaimer, &quot;This is a souvenir banknote and not for official use.&quot;

<doc id="339522" wikidata="Q7404985" url="?curid=339522" title="Salli Terri">
<text>Salli C. Terri (September 3, 1922 – May 5, 1996) was a singer, arranger, recording artist, and composer. Record audiences still cite Terri&#x27;s &quot;haunting&quot; vocals, with &quot;Hi-Fi Review&quot; originally describing her as &quot;a mezzo soprano whose velvet voice and astonishing flexibility has hardly an equal at present.&quot; 

==Background==
Salli Terri was born Stella Tirri in London, Ontario, Canada. Her father, Sicilian-born Joseph Tirri, was a violinist and conductor. When Salli was a small child, the Tirri family moved to Detroit, Michigan.

Terri obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree in music from Wayne State University in Detroit and earned a master&#x27;s degree in music from the University of Southern California. From 1950 to 1952, she taught music and drama at the American School in Japan (Chōfu, Tokyo).

==Early career==
Terri joined the Roger Wagner Chorale in 1952 for its first tour of the western United States. In 1953, she performed with the group at the coronation celebration for Queen Elizabeth II in London.

Terri first became known to the record-buying public through her featured solos, musical arrangements and as the author of liner notes for best selling albums by the Roger Wagner Chorale released by Capitol Records. Her notable solos include: &quot;I Wonder as I Wander&quot; and &quot;Sometimes I Feel like a Motherless Child&quot; (&quot;Folk Songs of the New World&quot; US Capitol – P8324), &quot;Jesus, Jesus Rest Your Head&quot; on the gold record 1956 Christmas recording &quot;Joy To the World&quot; (US Capitol – P8353/SP8353), and &quot;Were You There&quot; from the 1957 &quot;House of the Lord&quot; (US Capitol – P8365/SP8365).

==Duets with the Spanish Guitar==
In 1958, Salli Terri joined guitarist Laurindo Almeida and flautist Martin Ruderman on the Grammy winning &quot;Duets with the Spanish Guitar&quot;, an album widely considered to be the first classical crossover album. In this recording, Almeida arranges standard classical and folk repertoire through the prism of several Latin musical forms, including the modinha, charo, maracatu and boi bumba. The result, according to &quot;Hi-Fi and Music Review&quot; was &quot;&quot;...a prize winner in my collection. Laurindo Almeida&#x27;s guitar playing captures the keen poignancy and rhythmic élan of Brazilian music with superb assurance and taste...Salli Terri sings Villa-Lobos &quot;Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5&quot; with a sinuousness and ecstasy which makes this the finest modern version.&quot; It has also been reported that composer Heitor Villa-Lobos considered the Almeida/Terri &quot;Bachianas Brasileiras&quot; &quot;...the best recorded performance of this work.&quot;

The recording won for Best Classical Engineered Recording for engineer Sherwood Hall III at the first Grammy Awards ceremony (Grammy Awards of 1959). Terri was also nominated for Best Classical Vocal Performance. In her recent memoir &quot;Simple Dreams&quot;, singer Linda Ronstadt discusses &quot;Duets With the Spanish Guitar&quot;, noting her aunt, the renowned Spanish singer Luisa Espinel was a friend of Terri: &quot;Knowing I wanted to sing, Aunt Luisa had sent me a recording, Duets with the Spanish Guitar, which featured guitarist Laurindo Almeida dueting alternately with flautist Martin Ruderman and soprano Salli Terri. It became one of my most cherished recordings.&quot;

The album, with additions from later recordings, was renamed &quot;Duets with Spanish Guitar&quot;, and re-released in 1990 on a CD in the United States (USA), Canada, the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, and France. The tracks are still available on internet music sites, and the album still continues to receive accolades. In 2010, &quot;Fanfare&quot; inducted &quot;Duets with the Spanish Guitar&quot; into its Classical Recording Hall of Fame.

The success of &quot;Duets with the Spanish Guitar&quot; led to additional recordings with Almeida, including the 1960 &quot;Conversations with the Guitar&quot; which won the Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance Vocal or Instrumental Chamber Music. While continuing to arrange and record with the Roger Wagner Chorale, Terri also embarked on a solo recording career, which resulted in seven LPs, including the albums &quot;Songs of Enchantment&quot; (Capitol P8482), &quot;At the Gate of Heaven&quot; (Capitol P8504) and &quot;Songs of the American Land&quot; with the Jack Halloran Quartet (Capitol P8522), produced by Robert E. Myers.

==Later career==
Terri&#x27;s eclectic repertoire included religious music, love songs, folk tunes and ballads. Her inclusive musical approach led to wide-ranging roles in Hollywood, academia, and concert performance. Her film work included &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;Bells are Ringing&quot;, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, and Jerry Lewis&#x27;s Cinderfella. Terri&#x27;s vocals were also featured on early 1960s recordings &quot;Voodoo&quot; and &quot;Chant of the Moon&quot; by the classic lounge exotica by Robert Drasnin with composer John Williams on piano.

In addition to her recording career, Salli Terri was a professor of music and directed a woman&#x27;s choir at UCLA, University of California, Santa Barbara and Fullerton (CA) Junior College. Her expertise in early American music, particularly in Shaker traditions, led in the composition of two works, &quot;Shaker Worship Service&quot; (1971) and &quot;A Moravian Lovefeast&quot; (1978) and more than 50 choral arrangements . She also edited two books of choral rounds, &quot;rounds for everyone from everywhere&quot; (1961) and &quot;around the year in rounds&quot; (1974). Her performing career continued with frequent appearances with the John Biggs Consort, led by her husband composer John Biggs which featured medieval and Renaissance music. Note: some sources incorrectly refer to Laurindo Almeida as Terri&#x27;s husband. Almeida and Terri were not married.

Her most widely known recording, the first part of section 5 from Bachianas Brasileiras, was featured in the film Fifty Shades of Grey (2014) as well as at the Winter Olympics.

==Terri&#x27;s musical perspective==
A 1960 Toronto Telegram profile of Terri included this observation from the singer/composer/arranger:

&quot;I don&#x27;t like words or phrases like &#x27;longhair&#x27; or &#x27;the classics&#x27; or &#x27;pops&#x27; or &#x27;easy listening&#x27;…they are &#x27;dividing lines&#x27;; words which reinforce and perpetuate outmoded narrow prejudices instead of sweeping them aside. To me, the whole world of music is so wide and deep and exciting that there just never will be enough hours in a day or days in a week to let me hear and sing and soak up all the marvelous things available…We all strongly believe there are many different kinds of good music and we are opposed to musical snobbery wherever it exists.&quot;

The author Clyde Gilmour observed &quot;the &#x27;we&#x27; included her friend and colleague Laurindo Almeida, the renowned guitarist…conductor Roger Wagner…a flute virtuoso named Martin Ruderman, and Robert E Myers, a Capitol Records executive who often supervises her albums.&quot;

==Death==
Salli Terri died on May 5, 1996, in Long Beach, California, US after a series of strokes.

==Legacy==
Salli&#x27;s original vinyl recordings can often still be found on eBay and in vintage record stores, and are collected worldwide. Her most popular recording, Duets With the Spanish Guitar, has been continuously reissued since its first print, and is a consistent seller (on CD) on Amazon.com and other online outlets.

Terri was married to singer-composer John Biggs&#x27; (born 1932) and their daughters, Jennifer Biggs Walton and Adrienne Biggs, are both musicians. Walton is a violinist and owns Instrumental Casting, an agency which casts musicians in film, television, video and commercial work. Adrienne plays the violin and performs with Danny Click and the Hell Yeahs, a California Bay Area band whose recent recordings have hit the Americana country music charts.

A UK-based fan created a tribute site, www.salliterri.org, which has an extensive discography, photos, and notes from fans as well as former friends and students.

<text>Breathless () is a 1960 French New Wave crime drama film written and directed by Jean-Luc Godard. It stars Jean-Paul Belmondo as a wandering criminal named Michel, and Jean Seberg as his American girlfriend Patricia. The film was Godard&#x27;s first feature-length work and represented Belmondo&#x27;s breakthrough as an actor.

&quot;Breathless&quot; is an influential example of French New Wave (&quot;nouvelle vague&quot;) cinema. Along with François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; and Alain Resnais&#x27;s &quot;Hiroshima mon amour&quot;, both released a year earlier, it brought international attention to new styles of French filmmaking. At the time, &quot;Breathless&quot; attracted much attention for its bold visual style, which included then unconventional use of jump cuts.

Upon its initial release in France, the film attracted over two million viewers. It has since been considered one of the best films ever made, repeatedly appearing in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine&#x27;s decennial polls of filmmakers and critics on the subject. In May 2010, a fully restored version of the film was released in the United States to coincide with the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

==Plot==
Michel is a youthful, dangerous criminal who models himself on the film persona of Humphrey Bogart. After stealing a car in Marseille, Michel shoots and kills a policeman who has followed him onto a country road. Penniless and on the run from the police, he turns to an American love interest, Patricia, a student and aspiring journalist, who sells the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; on the boulevards of Paris. The ambivalent Patricia unwittingly hides him in her apartment as he simultaneously tries to seduce her and call in a loan to fund their escape to Italy. Patricia says she is pregnant, probably with Michel&#x27;s child. When the police question her, Patricia realizes that Michel is on the run. Eventually she betrays him, but before the police arrive, she tells Michel what she has done. He is somewhat resigned to a life in prison, and does not try to escape at first. A friend of his arrives and attempts to hand him a gun, but he refuses. As the police arrive, the friend drives off, but throws the gun towards Michel, who picks it up. The police shoot him in the street, and after running along the block, he collapses. As Patricia stands over the dying Michel, he curses her with his last words, but she does not understand his French.

==Production==
===Background and writing===
&quot;Breathless&quot; was loosely based on a newspaper article that François Truffaut read in &quot;The News in Brief&quot; about Michel Portail and his American journalist girlfriend Beverly Lynette. In November 1952, Portail stole a car to visit his sick mother in Le Havre and ended up killing a motorcycle cop named Grimberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanmartians/Breathless&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzgerald/3-Linklater&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Truffaut wrote a treatment with Claude Chabrol, but they disagreed on the story structure.

Godard was working as a press agent at 20th Century Fox when he met producer Georges de Beauregard. He helped Beauregard with the script for &quot;Pêcheur d&#x27;Islande&quot;, but pitched him on &quot;Breathless&quot; because he liked the treatment. Chabrol and Truffaut were now star directors. They were at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1959 when they wrote Beauregard to endorse Godard as the director. Their names helped greenlight the film, but both would have very small roles in its production.

The final screenplay deviates very little from Truffaut&#x27;s original treatment, aside from the much longer bedroom scene. Godard wrote the script as he went along. He told Truffaut, &quot;the subject will be the story of a boy who thinks of death and of a girl who doesn&#x27;t.&quot; Truffaut believed Godard&#x27;s change to the ending was personal, &quot;In my script, the film ends with the boy walking along the street as more and more people turn and stare after him, because his photo&#x27;s on the front of all the newspapers...Jean-Luc chose a violent end because he was by nature sadder than I.&quot;

Godard used screenwriter Paul Gégauff, who was known as a swaggering seducer of women, as inspiration for Michel&#x27;s character. Fellow New Wave director Jacques Rivette appears in a cameo as the dead body of a man hit by a car in the street. The film includes many in-jokes like the young woman selling &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; and Michel&#x27;s occasional alias of Laszlo Kovacs, the name of Belmondo&#x27;s character in Chabrol&#x27;s 1959 film &quot;Web of Passion&quot;.

Jean-Paul Belmondo was not famous outside of France prior to &quot;Breathless&quot;. In order to broaden the film&#x27;s commercial appeal, Godard sought a prominent leading lady who would be willing to work in his low-budget film. He came to Jean Seberg through his acquaintance with her husband Francois Moreuil. In June 1959, Seberg agreed to appear in the film for $15,000, one-sixth of the film&#x27;s budget. Godard gave Moreuil a cameo in the film. During filming, Seberg privately questioned Godard&#x27;s style and wondered if the film would be commercially viable. After it was a success, she reprised her character in Godard&#x27;s &quot;Le Grand Escroc&quot;.

Godard wanted cinematographer Michel Latouche to shoot the film after working with him on his short films. Instead, De Beauregard hired Raoul Coutard, who he had on contract.

The 1958 ethno-fiction &quot;Moi, un noir&quot; has been credited as a key influence for Godard. This can be seen in the adoption of jump-cuts, use of real locations rather than constructed sets and the documentary, newsreel format of filming.

===Filming===
Godard envisaged &quot;Breathless&quot; as a documentary and tasked cinematographer Raoul Coutard to shoot the entire film on a hand-held camera with next to no lighting. In order to shoot under low-light levels, Coutard had to use Ilford HP5 film, which was not available as motion picture film stock at the time. He therefore took 18-metre lengths of HP5 film sold for 35mm still cameras and spliced them into 120-metre rolls. During development he pushed the negative one stop from 400 ASA to 800 ASA.

The size of the sprocket holes in the photographic film was different from that of motion picture film, and the Eclair Cameflex camera was the only camera that worked for the film used. Nearly the entire film had to be dubbed in post-production because the Cameflex was noisy and incapable of synchronized sound.

Filming ran 23 days from August 17 until September 12, 1959. It included President Eisenhower&#x27;s visit to Paris, which Godard used as a backdrop for the film. The crew met at Café Notre Dame and shot for two hours until Godard ran out of ideas. According to Coutard, the film was virtually improvised on the spot, and Godard wrote dialogue in an exercise book that no one was allowed to see. Godard gave lines to Belmondo and Seberg with only brief rehearsals before filming.

Locations were selected in advance, and assistant director Pierre Rissient described the shoot as very organized. However, filming was done without permits, adding to the spontaneous feel Godard wanted. Michel&#x27;s death was filmed on the rue Campagne-Première in Paris. Actor Richard Balducci said shooting days could range from 15 minutes to 12 hours, depending on how many ideas Godard had. Producer Georges de Beauregard wrote a letter to the crew complaining about the erratic shooting schedule. Coutard claimed Beauregard got in a fistfight with Godard when he found the director at a café on a day when he had called in sick.

Godard shot the movie&#x27;s first sequence toward the end, but most of the filming was chronological. There was minimal crew and no lights for the bedroom scene with Michel and Patricia at the Hôtel de Suède. Godard was determined to shoot there after living at the hotel in the early 1950s. Instead of renting a dolly with complicated and time-consuming tracks to lay, Godard often pushed Coutard in a wheelchair. For certain street scenes, Coutard hid in a postal cart with a hole for the lens and packages piled on top of him.

===Editing===
&quot;Breathless&quot; was processed and edited at GTC Labs in Joinville by Cécile Decugis and his assistant Lila Herman. Decugis said the film earned a pre-release reputation as the worst film of the year.

Pierre Rissient said that the jump cut style was not intended during the film&#x27;s shooting or the initial stages of editing. Coutard said that &quot;there was a panache in the way it was edited that didn&#x27;t match at all the way it was shot. The editing gave it a very different tone than the films we were used to seeing.&quot; The film&#x27;s use of jump cuts has been called innovative. Andrew Sarris analyzed it as existentially representing &quot;the meaninglessness of the time interval between moral decisions.&quot;

===Publicity===
Godard and his media-savvy friends were well-positioned to gin up publicity before the movie was released. Richard Balducci was in charge of promoting the film and he embedded a reporter from &quot;France-Observateur&quot; in the crew to report on the production. A novelization by Claude Francolin was released in February 1960, a month before the film&#x27;s release. Columbia also issued a soundtrack album of Martial Solal&#x27;s music.

==Reception==
&quot;Breathless&quot; was on the cover of &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&#x27;s&quot; January issue, months before its release. That same month, Godard was awarded the Prix Jean Vigo for his work on the film. Luc Moullet wrote, &quot;Of all the films now being made by the newcomers to French cinema, &quot;À bout de souffle&quot; is not the best, since &quot;Les 400 coups&quot; has a head start on it; it is not the most striking - we have &quot;Hiroshima mon amour&quot; for that. But it is the most representative.&quot; By June of that year, it was already pointed to as &quot;the crowning point of the new wave&quot;.

Bosley Crowther called the film a &quot;fascinating communication&quot; which is &quot;emphatically unrestrainedly vicious, completely devoid of moral tone&quot; and shocking due to the &quot;vigor of its reportorial candor&quot;. Crowther described Godard&#x27;s editing as &quot;pictorial cacophony&quot;. He saw Belmondo as &quot;hypnotically ugly&quot; and &quot;the most effective cigarette-mouther and thumb-to-lip rubber since time began&quot;. Archer Winsten deemed it &quot;a very fine piece of work&quot;. Though he found the film too insubstantial to be remembered, he concluded &quot;the technique should linger, and so should these talents, here so highly visible and memorable.&quot;

In a 1972 essay about &quot;Breathless&quot;, Oliver Stone zeroed in on the bedroom scenes as the core of the film. He explains the rigidity of cinematic bedroom scenes with their &quot;definite pace from window to bed and climactically into the sheets. Even in the rather perverse imaginations of Vadim or Chabrol, these basic rhythms operate. With Godard, no such thing.&quot;

Richard Brody enthused, &quot;&quot;Breathless&quot; opened...not in an art house but at a chain of four commercial theaters, selling 259,046 tickets in four weeks. The eventual profit was substantial...The film&#x27;s success with the public corresponded to its generally ardent and astonished critical reception.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic A. O. Scott wrote in 2010, 50 years after the release of &quot;Breathless&quot;, that it is both &quot;a pop artifact and a daring work of art&quot; and even at 50, &quot;still cool, still new, still – after all this time! – a bulletin from the future of movies.&quot; Roger Ebert included it on his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list in 2003, writing that &quot;No debut film since &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; in 1942 has been as influential,&quot; dismissing its jump cuts as the biggest breakthrough, and instead calling revolutionary its &quot;headlong pacing, its cool detachment, its dismissal of authority, and the way its narcissistic young heroes are obsessed with themselves and oblivious to the larger society.&quot;

The film has a 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 82 reviews. Its critical consensus states, &quot;&quot;Breathless&quot; rewrote the rules of cinema -- and more than 50 years after its arrival, Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s paradigm-shifting classic remains every bit as vital&quot;.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited this movie as one of his 100 favorite films.

==Themes==
Oliver Stone invokes Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s metaphor of the &quot;last man&quot; during his analysis of Patricia. Stone paraphrases &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, &quot;What is pain? What is love? What is creation?...What is a star? What is anything anymore?&quot; Stone concludes that such philosophical skepticism is a logical endpoint for a character like Patricia.

Hubert Dreyfus sees the film as exemplifying Nietzsche&#x27;s conception of (&quot;active&quot; versus &quot;passive&quot;) nihilism. Michel is carelessly active and bold. He falls in love with Patricia, who is uncomfortable in such engagements. Her cooperation with the police leads to his death. Patricia&#x27;s monotone reaction to Michel&#x27;s death indicates her brutal distance to relationships. Michel knew her coldness would end badly for him.

===Closing dialogue===
Michel&#x27;s dying words are mumbled and hard to hear: &quot;C&#x27;est vraiment dégueulasse&quot;. Throughout the film, &quot;dégueulasse&quot; has been clearly used to mean &quot;disgusting&quot; in reference to things like Michel&#x27;s request for a loan and the music of Frédéric Chopin. The word has many other implications in French. It can be a synonym for &quot;bitch&quot; or &quot;heel&quot;, as well as implying nausea and the urge to vomit. In French, &quot;bouche&quot; refers to the human mouth, while &quot;gueule&quot; means the wider mouth of an animal, e.g. dog, though commonly used for mouth and derogatory only in certain expressions, e.g. &quot;ferme ta gueule&quot; (shut your trap).

==Legacy==
Godard said the success of &quot;Breathless&quot; was a mistake. He added &quot;there used to be just one way. There was one way you could do things. There were people who protected it like a copyright, a secret cult only for the initiated. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t regret making &quot;Breathless&quot; and blowing that all apart.&quot; In 1964, Godard described his and his colleagues&#x27; impact: &quot;We barged into the cinema like cavemen into the Versailles of Louis XV.&quot;

The British Film Institute included the film on several lists in its &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; magazine:
*1992: Critic&#x27;s Poll, #22
*2002: Critic&#x27;s Poll, #15
*2012: Top Films of All Time, #13 
*2012: Directors&#x27; Top Films, #11
*2022: Critics&#x27; Top Films of All Time, #38 
*2022: Director&#x27;s Top Films of All Time, #15

===In popular culture===
* The film is frequently referenced in the &quot;Youth in Revolt&quot; book series, being a favorite of female protagonist Sheeni Saunders, including her dreams of running off to France and her fascination for Jean-Paul Belmondo.
* In &quot;The Doom Generation&quot;, characters play the &quot;smile or I&#x27;ll choke you&quot; game, and the film&#x27;s semi-general theme is of a &quot;nihilistic road movie&quot;.
* The Australian band The Death Set named their album from 2011 after main character Michel Poiccard.
* The final scene is mentioned (and later alluded to visually) in &quot;The Squid and the Whale&quot;.
* In the third episode of &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex&quot;, &quot;Android and I&quot;, a 35mm reel of this film can be seen on a table, beneath a reel of &quot;Alphaville&quot;, as Togusa and Batou are investigating the house of a suspect. Other Godard works are also scattered through the scene. Dialog from this film is recited by two other characters throughout the episode. Themes from this episode parallel themes from both this movie and Godard&#x27;s complete oeuvre. The climax of the episode hinges on the final lines, including one additional line, from the final scene of the film.
* In an episode of &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;, Sergeant Jeffords mentions &quot;Breathless&quot; when the detectives are discussing their favorite cop movies. Jeffords identifies the film as &quot;François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Breathless&quot;&quot;, despite the fact that only the director&#x27;s name is generally used in such a way. In reference to this error, Jeffords is seen later in the season at a party, defending his statement by saying &quot;movies are a writer&#x27;s medium&quot;.
* In &quot;The Dreamers&quot; one of the protagonists re-enacts a scene from the film.
* The final scene is recreated in Romeo Void&#x27;s &quot;Never Say Never&quot; video.
* In issue #30 of IDW&#x27;s ongoing comic book series &quot;Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye&quot;, Whirl votes for repeat showings of the film during the crew&#x27;s movie night.
* The Canadian band The Tragically Hip made a music video for the song &quot;In View&quot; that pays homage to the film.
* In the 2001 Novel &quot;The Incorrigible Optimists Club&quot; by Jean-Michel Guenassia, the main character sees the film in the cinema with his family. The theater is empty and the woman working the ticket stand advises against seeing it. Nonetheless, he loves the film.
* The 2017 Malayalam-language film &quot;Mayaanadhi&quot; (&quot;Mystic River&quot;), directed by Ashiq Abu, draws inspiration from &quot;Breathless&quot;.
* The 1967 film &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; contains numerous visual references to &quot;Breathless&quot;, including an early shot of Warren Beatty wearing a fedora slanted over his eyes and with a match tilted upward held in his lips, echoing Jean-Paul Belmondo&#x27;s hat and cigarette in the opening scenes of &quot;Breathless&quot;. Later Beatty also wears a pair of round-rim black sunglasses with one lens missing, an exact visual reference to Belmondo wearing the same sunglasses with a missing lens later in &quot;Breathless&quot;. &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; also shares a general storyline with &quot;Breathless&quot;, involving a handsome, nihilistic young killer who steals cars and who connects with a beautiful, free-spirited young woman. Pauline Kael, in her 1967 review of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, wrote that &quot;If this way of holding more than one attitude toward life is already familiar to us—if we recognize the make-believe robbers whose toy guns produce real blood, and the Keystone cops who shoot them dead, from Truffaut’s &quot;Shoot the Piano Player&quot; and Godard’s gangster pictures, &quot;Breathless&quot; and Band of Outsiders—it’s because the young French directors discovered the poetry of crime in American life (from our movies) and showed the Americans how to put it on the screen in a new, &#x27;existential&#x27; way.&quot;
* In &quot;A Very Secret Service&quot;, the characters go to see &quot;Breathless&quot; in a movie theater, and are shown watching the iconic final scene.
* In &quot;The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo&quot;, fictional actress Evelyn Hugo, at a low point in her career, watches &quot;Breathless&quot; and is inspired to go to Paris to revive her career.

<text>A refinery is a production facility composed of a group of chemical engineering unit processes and unit operations refining certain materials or converting raw material into products of value.

==Types of refineries==

Different types of refineries are as follows:

* Petroleum oil refinery, which converts crude oil into high-octane motor spirit (gasoline/petrol), diesel oil, liquefied petroleum gases (LPG), kerosene, heating fuel oils, hexane, lubricating oils, bitumen, and petroleum coke
* Edible oil refinery which converts cooking oil into a product that is uniform in taste, smell and appearance, and stability
*Natural gas processing plant, which purifies and converts raw natural gas into residential, commercial and industrial fuel gas, and also recovers natural gas liquids (NGL) such as ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes
* Sugar refinery, which converts sugar cane and sugar beets into crystallized sugar and sugar syrups
* Salt refinery, which cleans common salt (NaCl), produced by the solar evaporation of sea water, followed by washing and re-crystallization
* Metal refineries refining metals such as alumina, copper, gold, lead, nickel, silver, uranium, zinc, magnesium and cobalt
* Iron refining, a stage of refining pig iron (typically grey cast iron to white cast iron), before fining, which converts pig iron into bar iron or steel

===A typical oil refinery===

The image below is a schematic flow diagram of a typical oil refinery depicting various unit processes and the flow of intermediate products between the inlet crude oil feedstock and the final products. The diagram depicts only one of the hundreds of different configurations. It does not include any of the usual facilities providing utilities such as steam, cooling water, and electric power as well as storage tanks for crude oil feedstock and for intermediate products and end products.

===Natural gas processing plant===

The image below is a schematic block flow diagram of a typical natural gas processing plant. It shows various unit processes converting raw natural gas into gas pipelined to end users.

The block flow diagram also shows how processing of the raw natural gas yields byproduct sulfur, byproduct ethane, and natural gas liquids (NGL) propane, butanes and natural gasoline (denoted as pentanes +).

===Sugar refining===
Sugar is generally produced from sugarcane or sugar beets. As the global production of sugar from sugarcane is at least twice the production from sugar beets, this section focuses on sugarcane.

====Milling====
Sugarcane is traditionally refined into sugar in two stages. In the first stage, raw sugar is produced by the milling of harvested sugarcane. In a sugar mill, sugarcane is washed, chopped, and shredded by revolving knives. The shredded cane is mixed with water and crushed. The juices (containing 10-15 percent sucrose) are collected and mixed with lime to adjust pH to 7, prevent decay into glucose and fructose, and precipitate impurities. The lime and other suspended solids are settled out, and the clarified juice is concentrated in a multiple-effect evaporator to make a syrup with about 60 weight percent sucrose. The syrup is further concentrated under vacuum until it becomes supersaturated and is then seeded with crystalline sugar. Upon cooling, sugar crystallizes out of the syrup. Centrifuging then separates the sugar from the remaining liquid (molasses). Raw sugar has a yellow to brown color. Sugar is sometimes consumed locally at this stage but usually undergoes further purification. Sulfur dioxide is bubbled through the cane juice subsequent to crystallization in a process known as &quot;sulfitation&quot;. This process inhibits color forming reactions and stabilizes the sugar juices to produce &quot;mill white&quot; or &quot;plantation white&quot; sugar.

The fibrous solids, called &quot;bagasse&quot;, remaining after the crushing of the shredded sugarcane are burned for fuel which helps a sugar mill to become self-sufficient in energy. Any excess bagasse can be used for animal feed, to produce paper, or burned to generate electricity for the local power grid.

====Refining====
The second stage is often executed in heavy sugar-consuming regions such as North America, Europe, and Japan. In the second stage, white sugar is produced that is more than 99 percent pure sucrose. In such refineries, raw sugar is further purified by fractional crystallization.

<text>Louis Pierre Manuel (; July 1751 – 14 November 1793) was a republican French writer, municipal administrator of the police, and public prosecutor during the French Revolution who was arrested, trialled and guillotined.

==Life==

===Revolutionary===

He was born at Montargis, Loiret, and entered the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, becoming tutor to the son of a Paris banker. In 1783 his clandestine pamphlet, &quot;Essais historiques, critiques, littéraires, et philosophiques&quot;, resulted in his being imprisoned in the Bastille.

Manuel, a man of letters passionately embraced the revolutionary ideas, and after the storming of the Bastille became a member of the provisional municipality of Paris, administrating the Garde Nationale and gendarme. Early December 1791 he was elected as &quot;procureur public&quot; of the commune, charged with both the investigation and prosecution of crime and representing the King. In a discussion about the right of veto (to suspend a law for a period or until the fulfillment of a condition) he told the Jacobins as a patriot he did not like the King, but he should have the right to leave or to abdicate. As Manuel was not from Paris he lost popularity. On 24 February 1792 Manuel was installed as procureur of the commune, gave a speech warning against anarchy. He proposed to sell the portraits of bishops hanging inside the building. 

Manuel was associated with the Demonstration of 20 June 1792, which he visited as a private person. Afterwards he and Pétion de Villeneuve, the mayor were dismissed on 6 July by the Conseil Général, but reappointed on 23 July by the Assembly. During the 10 August storming of the Tuileries Palace, he was up all night and played a part in the formation of the insurrectionary Paris Commune which assured the success of the latter attack (begun by the taking of the &quot;Hôtel de Ville&quot;). On 12 August Robespierre and Manuel visited the Temple prison to check on the security of the royal family. Manuel and Pétion were against their imprisonment. At the end of the month and with a sense of martyrdom, Manuel or Robespierre seem to have ordered the sections to maintain their posts and die if necessary. On 28 August he helped Madame de Stael and released some of her friends. It is not clear if he saved the life of Beaumarchais who was jailed on the 23rd and released a week later, only three days before a massacre took place in the prison where he had been detained. 

Manuel lived at Place Dauphine and was present at the nearby Abbaye Prison on the first day of the September Massacres. The door was closed, but the killing was resumed after an intense discussion with Manuel, on people&#x27;s justice and failing judges. Manuel belonged to a deputation sent by the general council (Conseil général) of the commune to ask for compassion. They were insulted and escaped with their lives. Late in the evening, Madame de Stael was conveyed home, escorted by Manuel. He saved the life of governess Madame Tourzel, because of her mother. 

On 7 September 1792, he was elected one of the deputies from Paris to the National Convention. On 3 November, he declared in the gallery of the Jacobin Club that &quot;the massacres of September had been the Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Day of the people, who had shown themselves to be as wicked as a king, and that the whole of Paris was guilty of having suffered these assassinations.

He suppressed the decoration of the Cross of Saint Louis, which he called &quot;a stain on a man&#x27;s coat&quot;, requested that Pétion de Villeneuve, the first president of Convention to be housed in the palace of the Tuileries, and demanded the sale of the Palace of Versailles.

===Independent politics and execution===

In 1792 he was prosecuted for publishing four volumes of the indecent &quot;:fr: Lettres à Sophie&quot; de Ruffey, written in jail by Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau between 1777-1780, but was acquitted.

Manuel changed his opinions on King Louis XVI through his connection with Pétion and the Brissotins; he refused to vote in favor of the execution of the former sovereign. Never before the Convention was like a court. He accused The Mountain of being anarchists and murderers. Consequently, he resigned as deputy. succeeded by Fouquier-Tinville as public prosecutor. He retired to Montargis, where his house was attacked by the crowd on 14 March 1793. Heavily bleeding he was taken to the liberty tree, arrested, and put in prison almost naked. At the end of August he was transported to the Prison de l&#x27;Abbaye and on 13 November to the Conciergerie. In his trial Fouquier-Tinville accused him of being a libertine, offering wine to the &quot;septembriseurs&quot;, stealing money and organizing a conspiration against the one and indivisible republic. He was guillotined the same day, 24 Brumaire.

<doc id="339535" wikidata="Q746687" url="?curid=339535" title="Current account (balance of payments)">
<text>In macroeconomics and international finance, a country&#x27;s current account records the value of exports and imports of both goods and services and international transfers of capital. It is one of the two components of the balance of payments, the other being the capital account (also known as the financial account). Current account measures the nation&#x27;s earnings and spendings abroad and it consists of the balance of trade, net &quot;primary income&quot; or &quot;factor income&quot; (earnings on foreign investments minus payments made to foreign investors) and net unilateral transfers, that have taken place over a given period of time. The current account balance is one of two major measures of a country&#x27;s foreign trade (the other being the net capital outflow). A current account surplus indicates that the value of a country&#x27;s net foreign assets (i.e. assets less liabilities) grew over the period in question, and a current account deficit indicates that it shrank. Both government and private payments are included in the calculation. It is called the current account because goods and services are generally consumed in the current period.

==Overview==

The current account is an important indicator of an economy&#x27;s external sector. It is defined as the sum of the balance of trade (goods and services exports minus imports), net income from abroad, and net current transfers. A positive current account balance indicates the nation is a net lender to the rest of the world, while a negative current account balance indicates that it is a net borrower from the rest of the world. A current account surplus increases a nation&#x27;s net foreign assets by the amount of the surplus, and a current account deficit decreases it by that amount.

A country&#x27;s balance of trade is the net or difference between the country&#x27;s exports of goods and services and its imports of goods and services, excluding all financial transfers, investments and other components, over a given period of time. A country is said to have a trade surplus if its exports exceed its imports, and a trade deficit if its imports exceed its exports.

Positive net sales abroad generally contribute to a &quot;current account surplus&quot;; negative net sales abroad generally contribute to a &quot;current account deficit&quot;. Because exports generate positive net sales, and because the trade balance is typically the largest component of the current account, a current account surplus is usually associated with positive net exports.

In the net factor income or income account, income payments are outflows, and income receipts are inflows. Income are receipts from investments made abroad (note: investments are recorded in the capital account but income from investments is recorded in the current account) and money sent by individuals working abroad, known as remittances, to their families back home. If the income account is negative, the country is paying more than it is taking in interest, dividends, etc.

The various subcategories in the income account are linked to specific respective subcategories in the capital account, as income is often composed of factor payments from the ownership of capital (assets) or the negative capital (debts) abroad. From the capital account, economists and central banks determine implied rates of return on the different types of capital. The United States, for example, gleans a substantially larger rate of return from foreign capital than foreigners do from owning United States capital.

In the traditional accounting of balance of payments, the current account equals the change in net foreign assets. A current account deficit implies a reduction of net foreign assets:

: Current account = change in net foreign assets.

If an economy is running a current account deficit, it is absorbing (absorption = domestic consumption + investment + government spending) more than that it is producing. This can only happen if some other economies are lending their savings to it (in the form of debt to or direct/ portfolio investment in the economy) or the economy is running down its foreign assets such as official foreign currency reserve.

On the other hand, if an economy is running a current account surplus it is absorbing less than that it is producing. This means it is saving. As the economy is open, this saving is being invested abroad and thus foreign assets are being created.

== Calculation ==
Normally, the current account is calculated by adding up the 4 components of current account: goods, services, income and current transfers.

; Goods: Being movable and physical in nature, goods are often traded by countries all over the world. When a transaction of certain good&#x27;s ownership from a local country to a foreign country takes place, this is called an &quot;export&quot;. The other way around, when a good&#x27;s owner changes to a local inhabitant from a foreigner, is defined to be an &quot;import&quot;. In calculating current account, exports are marked as credit (the inflow of money) and imports as debit (the outflow of money).
; Services: When an intangible service (e.g. tourism) is used by a foreigner in a local land and the local resident receives the money from a foreigner, this is also counted as an export, thus a credit.
; Factor Income: A credit of income happens when an individual or a company of domestic nationality receives money from a company or individual with foreign identity. In general, receipts (inflows) of factor income are considered credits and payments abroad (outflows) of factor income are considered debits. For example, interest received in the home-country from a bond bought abroad or deposits held abroad are a credits. The repatriated profit of a home company that has a factory abroad or the dividents paid to a home country investor from shares bought of a company abroad is also a credit. 
; Current transfers: Current transfers take place when a certain foreign country simply provides currency to another country with nothing received as a return. Typically, such transfers are done in the form of donations, aids, or official assistance. Remittances from migrants are part of the balance of current transfers.

A country&#x27;s current account can be calculated by the following formula:

formula_1
Where CA is the current account, X and M are respectively the export and import of goods and services, NY the net income from abroad, and NCT the net current transfers.

Better still a country can calculate its current account balance by simply adding the value of the visible balance of trade to that of the invisible balance of trade. the visible balance of trade is the sum total of the differences of all the imports and export of all tangible goods while the invisible balance of trade is the total gotten from the difference between exports and imports of services.

== Reducing current account deficits ==

A nation&#x27;s current account balance is influenced by numerous factors – its trade policies, exchange rate, competitiveness, forex reserves, inflation rate and others.
Since the trade balance (exports minus imports) is generally the biggest determinant of the current account surplus or deficit, the current account balance often displays a cyclical trend. During a strong economic expansion, import volumes typically surge; if exports are unable to grow at the same rate, the current account deficit will widen. Conversely, during a recession, the current account deficit will shrink if imports decline and exports increase to stronger economies.
The currency exchange rate exerts a significant influence on the trade balance, and by extension, on the current account. An overvalued currency makes imports cheaper and exports less competitive, thereby widening the current account deficit (or narrowing the surplus). An undervalued currency, on the other hand, boosts exports and makes imports more expensive, thus increasing the current account surplus (or narrowing the deficit).
Nations with chronic current account deficits often come under increased investor scrutiny during periods of heightened uncertainty. The currencies of such nations often come under speculative attack during such times. This creates a vicious circle where precious foreign exchange reserves are depleted to support the domestic currency, and this forex reserve depletion – combined with a deteriorating trade balance – puts further pressure on the currency. Embattled nations are often forced to take stringent measures to support the currency, such as raising interest rates and curbing currency outflows.

Action to reduce a substantial current account deficit usually involves increasing exports (goods going out of a country and entering abroad countries) or decreasing imports (goods coming from a foreign country into a country). Firstly, this is generally accomplished directly through import restrictions, quotas, or duties (though these may indirectly limit exports as well), or by promoting exports (through subsidies, custom duty exemptions etc.). Influencing the exchange rate to make exports cheaper for foreign buyers will indirectly increase the balance of payments. Also, currency wars, a phenomenon evident in post recessionary markets is a protectionist policy, whereby countries devalue their currencies to ensure export competitiveness. Secondly, adjusting government spending to favor domestic suppliers is also effective.

Less obvious methods to reduce a current account deficit include measures that increase domestic savings (or reduced domestic borrowing), including a reduction in borrowing by the national government.

A current account deficit is not always a problem. The &quot;Pitchford thesis&quot; states that a current account deficit does not matter if it is driven by the private sector. It is also known as the &quot;consenting adults&quot; view of the current account, as it holds that deficits are not a problem if they result from private sector agents engaging in mutually beneficial trade. A current account deficit creates an obligation of repayments of foreign capital, and that capital consists of many individual transactions. Pitchford asserts that since each of these transactions were individually considered financially sound when they were made, their aggregate effect (the current account deficit) is also sound.

A deficit implies we import more goods and services than we export.

The current account equals:
* Trade in goods (visible balance)
* Trade in services (Invisible balance) e.g. insurance and services
* Investment incomes e.g. dividends, interest and migrants remittances from abroad
* Net transfers – e.g. International aid

The current account is essentially exports – imports (+net international investment balance)

If one has a current account deficit, in a floating exchange rate this must be balanced by a surplus on the financial / capital account.

==Interrelationships in the balance of payments==

The balance of payments (BOP) is the record of a country&#x27;s monetary transactions with the rest of the world. Transactions are either marked as a credit or a debit. Within the BOP there are three separate categories under which different transactions are categorized: the current account, the capital account and the financial account. In the current account, goods, services, income and current transfers are recorded. In the capital account, physical assets such as a building or a factory are recorded. And in the financial account, assets pertaining to international monetary flows of, for example, business or portfolio investments are noted.

Absent changes in official reserves, the current account is the mirror image of the sum of the capital and financial accounts. One might then ask: Is the current account driven by the capital and financial accounts or is it vice versa? The traditional response is that the current account is the main causal factor, with capital and financial accounts simply reflecting financing of a deficit or investment of funds arising as a result of a surplus. However, more recently some observers have suggested that the opposite causal relationship may be important in some cases. In particular, it has controversially been suggested that the United States current account deficit is driven by the desire of international investors to acquire US assets (see Ben Bernanke, William Poole links below). However, the main viewpoint undoubtedly remains that the causative factor is the current account and that the positive financial account reflects the need to finance the country&#x27;s current account deficit.

Current account surpluses are facing current account deficits of other countries, the indebtedness of which towards abroad therefore increases. According to Balances Mechanics by Wolfgang Stützel this is described as surplus of expenses over the revenues. Increasing imbalances in foreign trade are critically discussed as a possible cause of the financial crisis since 2007. The existing differences between the current accounts in the eurozone is considered to be the root cause of the Euro crisis by many Keynesian economists, such as Yanis Varoufakis, Heiner Flassbeck, Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz.

Since 1989, the current account deficit of the US has been increasingly large, reaching close to 7% of the GDP in 2006. In 2011, it was the highest deficit in the world. New evidence, however, suggests that the US current account deficits are being mitigated by positive valuation effects. That is, the US assets overseas are gaining in value relative to the domestic assets held by foreign investors. The net foreign assets of the US are therefore not deteriorating one to one with the current account deficits. The most recent experience has reversed this positive valuation effect, however, with the US net foreign asset position deteriorating by more than two trillion dollars in 2008, down to less than $18 trillion, but has since risen to $25 trillion. This temporary decline was due primarily to the relative under-performance of domestic ownership of foreign assets (largely foreign equities) compared to foreign ownership of domestic assets (largely US treasuries and bonds).

==OECD quarterly international trade statistics==
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD – an international economic organisation of 34 countries, founded in 1961 to &quot;promote policies that will improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world&quot; – produces quarterly reports on its 34 member nations comparing statistics on balance of payments and international trade in terms of current account balance in billions of US dollars and as a percentage of GDP.

For example, according to their report the current account balance in billions of US dollars of several countries can be compared,
*Australia for 2013 was −51.39 and 2014 was −43.69, with each quarter between 2013 Q1 through 2015 Q2 ranging from a low of −14.81 in Q2 2015 to a high of −8.53 in Q1 2014. Australia&#x27;s current account balance in Q2 2015 was up down to −14.81. The current balance in Q2 as a percentage of GDP was −4.7%.
* Canada for 2013 was −54.62, and 2014 was −37.46 with each quarter between 2013 Q1 through 2015 Q2 ranging from a low of −14.63 in Q1 2015 to a high of −8.28 in Q3 2014. Canada&#x27;s current account balance in Q2 2015 was up at −14.15. The current balance in Q2 as a percentage of GDP was −3.5%.
* China for 2013 was 148.33, and 2014 was 219.90 with each quarter between 2013 Q1 through 2015 Q2 ranging from a low of 31.96 in Q4 2014 to a high of 75.58 in Q4 2013. The United States&#x27; current account balance in Q2 2015 was down to 73.03. The current balance in 2013 as a percentage of GDP was 1.6%.
* Germany for 2013 was 238.61, and 2014 was 285.82 with each quarter between 2013 Q1 through 2015 Q2 ranging from a low of 54.13 in Q3 2013 to a high of 68.89 in Q1 2014. Germany&#x27;s current account balance in Q2 2015 was up to 68.39. The current balance in Q2 as a percentage of GDP was 8.2%.
* Greece for 2013 was −4.89, and 2014 was −5.00 with each quarter between 2013 Q1 through 2015 Q2 ranging from a low of −2.76 in Q1 2013 to a high of 0.01 in Q2 2015. Greece&#x27;s current account balance in Q2 2015 was up to 0.01. The current balance in Q2 as a percentage of GDP was 0.0.
* The United States for 2013 was −376.76, and for 2014 was −389.53 with each quarter between 2013 Q1 through 2015 Q2 ranging from a low of −118.30 in Q1 2013 to a high of −81.63 in Q4 2013. The United States&#x27; current account balance in Q2 2015 was up to −109.68. The current balance in Q2 as a percentage of GDP was −2.4%.

The report also compares countries on services balance, exports of services, import of services, goods balance, export of goods and imports of goods in billions of US dollars.

==&quot;World Factbook&quot; data==

&quot;The World Factbook&quot;, a reference resource produced by the Central Intelligence Agency that collects data and publishes online open reports comparing the current account balance of countries. According to &quot;World Factbook&quot;, &quot;[c]urrent account balance compares a country&#x27;s net trade in goods and services, plus net earnings, and net transfer payments to and from the rest of the world during the period specified. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis.&quot; The top ten on their list of countries by current account balance in 2014 were:
# Germany: $286,400,000,000
# China: $219,700,000,000
# Netherlands: $90,160,000,000

==International Monetary Fund==
In a 2012 article published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) the authors argue that a current account deficit with higher investments and lower savings may indicate that the economy of a country is highly productive and growing. If there is an excess of imports over exports there may be problems in terms of competitiveness. Low savings and high investment can also be caused by a &quot;reckless fiscal policy or a consumption binge.&quot; China&#x27;s financial system favors the accumulation of large surpluses while the United States carries &quot;large and persistent current account deficits&quot; which has created a trade imbalance.

<doc id="339536" wikidata="Q313996" url="?curid=339536" title="Roberto Eduardo Viola">
<text>Roberto Eduardo Viola (13 October 1924 – 30 September 1994) was an Argentine military officer who served as the 43rd President of Argentina and the 2nd President of the National Reorganization Process from 29 March to 11 December 1981 as a military dictator.

==Early life==
He was born as Roberto Eduardo Viola on 13 October 1924. His parents were Italian immigrants Angelo Viola and Rosa Maria Prevedini, both from Casatisma, a town in the Province of Pavia.

==Presidency (1981)==
After Jorge Rafael Videla left office, Viola formally assumed the post of President of Argentina.

===Economic policy===
Viola appointed Lorenzo Sigaut as finance minister, and it became clear that Sigaut were looking for ways to reverse some of the economic policies of Videla&#x27;s minister José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz. Notably, Sigaut abandoned the sliding exchange rate mechanism and devalued the peso, after boasting that &quot;they who gamble on the dollar, will lose&quot;. Argentines braced for a recession after the excesses of the &quot;sweet money&quot; years, which destabilized Viola&#x27;s position.

Viola was also the victim of infighting within the armed forces. After being replaced as Navy chief, Eduardo Massera started looking for a political space to call his own, even enlisting the enforced and unpaid services of political prisoners held in concentration camps by the regime. The mainstream of the Junta&#x27;s support was strongly opposed to Massera&#x27;s designs and to any attempt to bring about more &quot;populist&quot; economic policies.

===Foreign policy===
Argentina-United States relations improved dramatically with the Ronald Reagan administration, which asserted that the previous Carter Administration had weakened US diplomatic relationships with Cold War allies in Argentina and reversed the previous administration&#x27;s official condemnation of the junta&#x27;s human rights practices.

The re-establishment of diplomatic ties allowed for CIA collaboration with the Argentine intelligence service in arming and training the Nicaraguan Contras against the Sandinista government. The 601 Intelligence Battalion, for example, trained Contras at Lepaterique base, in Honduras. Argentina also provided security advisors, intelligence training and some material support to forces in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to suppress local rebel groups as part of a U.S.-sponsored program called Operation Charly.

===Ousted in a coup===

Viola found his maneuvering space greatly reduced, and was ousted by a military coup in December 1981, led by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Lieutenant General Leopoldo Galtieri, who soon became president. The official explanation given for the ousting was Viola&#x27;s alleged health problems. Galtieri swiftly appointed Roberto Alemann as finance minister and presided over the build-up and pursuit of the Falklands War.

==Later years==

After the collapse of the military regime and the election of Raúl Alfonsín in 1983, Viola was arrested, judged for human rights violations committed by the military junta during the Dirty War, and sentenced to 17 years in prison. His health deteriorated in prison; Viola was pardoned by Carlos Menem in 1990 together with all junta members. He died on 30 September 1994, at age 69.

<doc id="339541" wikidata="Q121841103" url="?curid=339541" title="Chinese Turkestan">
<text>Chinese Turkestan, also spelled Chinese Turkistan, is a geographical term or historical region corresponding to the region of the Tarim Basin in Southern Xinjiang (south of the Tian Shan mountain range) or Xinjiang as a whole which was under the rule of the Qing dynasty of China. It is considered a part of the Chinese Tartary that covered the Inner Asian regions ruled by the Qing dynasty. The Europeans commonly used this term especially during the period of the Qing dynasty to denote the division of Turkestan into territories controlled by the Chinese and the Russians, with the latter controlling Russian Turkestan in the west.

==Etymology==

Eastern Central Asia was historically referred to as the Western Regions under the control of the Han dynasty and Tang dynasty of China. Over the course of the history the Turkic people conquered the Persian-speaking people in the region and established several small principalities in Central Asia. They then ruled over the region (later fell under the overlordship of the Mongols including the Chagatai Khanate and the Dzungar Khanate) until they were subjugated by the Chinese Qing dynasty during the final phase of the Dzungar–Qing Wars in the 1750s. Thence the European name of Chinese Turkestan (or Chinese Turkistan), similar to the name Russian Turkestan which was controlled by the Russian Empire and Afghan Turkestan in northern Afghanistan.

==Usage==

The term “Chinese Turkestan” or “Chinese Turkistan” was commonly used by Europeans during the period of the Qing dynasty to specifically refer to the region (as a part of Chinese Tartary that was ruled by Qing China), while the Chinese often called this region &quot;Tian Shan Nan Lu&quot; (Chinese: 天山南路), meaning the area in Xinjiang south of the Tian Shan Mountains. The term &quot;Chinese Turkestan&quot; (or &quot;Chinese Turkistan&quot;) can also refer to Xinjiang as a whole in some sources, and the term was also sometimes used by Qing officials in English-language writings. It gradually lost popularity in the 20th century worldwide after the fall of the Qing dynasty, although it was still being used in various publications during the eras when the Republic of China and the People&#x27;s Republic of China ruled the region. During the 20th century, Uyghur separatists and their supporters used East Turkestan as an appellation for the whole of Xinjiang (Dzungaria and Southern Xinjiang) or for a future independent state in present-day Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, whereas others typically use the name &quot;Xinjiang&quot; to refer to the autonomous region of China. As a result, the term &quot;Chinese Turkestan&quot; (or &quot;Chinese Turkistan&quot;) has largely been replaced by other terms nowadays, although it retains a certain degree of relevance.

<doc id="339542" wikidata="Q765289" url="?curid=339542" title="Semiprime">
<text>In mathematics, a semiprime is a natural number that is the product of exactly two prime numbers. The two primes in the product may equal each other, so the semiprimes include the squares of prime numbers.
Because there are infinitely many prime numbers, there are also infinitely many semiprimes. Semiprimes are also called biprimes, since they include two primes, or second numbers, by analogy with how &quot;prime&quot; means &quot;first&quot;.

==Examples and variations==
The semiprimes less than 200 are:

Semiprimes that are not square numbers are called discrete, distinct, or squarefree semiprimes:
The semiprimes are the case formula_1 of the formula_2-almost primes, numbers with exactly formula_2 prime factors. However some sources use &quot;semiprime&quot; to refer to a larger set of numbers, the numbers with at most two prime factors (including unit (1), primes, and semiprimes). These are:
==Formula for number of semiprimes==
A semiprime counting formula was discovered by E. Noel and G. Panos in 2005. Let formula_4 denote the number of semiprimes less than or equal to &quot;n&quot;. Then
formula_5
where formula_6 is the prime-counting function and formula_7 denotes the &quot;k&quot;th prime.

==Properties==
Semiprime numbers have no composite numbers as factors other than themselves. For example, the number 26 is semiprime and its only factors are 1, 2, 13, and 26, of which only 26 is composite.

For a squarefree semiprime formula_8 (with formula_9)
the value of Euler&#x27;s totient function formula_10 (the number of positive integers less than or equal to formula_11 that are relatively prime to formula_11) takes the simple form
formula_13
This calculation is an important part of the application of semiprimes in the RSA cryptosystem.
For a square semiprime formula_14, the formula is again simple:
formula_15

==Applications==

Semiprimes are highly useful in the area of cryptography and number theory, most notably in public key cryptography, where they are used by RSA and pseudorandom number generators such as Blum Blum Shub. These methods rely on the fact that finding two large primes and multiplying them together (resulting in a semiprime) is computationally simple, whereas finding the original factors appears to be difficult. In the RSA Factoring Challenge, RSA Security offered prizes for the factoring of specific large semiprimes and several prizes were awarded. The original RSA Factoring Challenge was issued in 1991, and was replaced in 2001 by the New RSA Factoring Challenge, which was later withdrawn in 2007.

In 1974 the Arecibo message was sent with a radio signal aimed at a star cluster. It consisted of formula_16 binary digits intended to be interpreted as a formula_17 bitmap image. The number formula_18 was chosen because it is a semiprime and therefore can be arranged into a rectangular image in only two distinct ways (23 rows and 73 columns, or 73 rows and 23 columns).

<doc id="339547" wikidata="Q727601" url="?curid=339547" title="Jean-Baptiste Carrier">
<text>Jean-Baptiste Carrier (; 16 March 1756 – 16 December 1794) was a French Revolutionary and politician most notable for his actions in the War in the Vendée during the Reign of Terror. While under orders to suppress a Royalist counter-revolution, he commanded the execution of 4,000 civilians, mainly priests, women and children in Nantes, some by drowning in the river Loire, which Carrier described as &quot;the National Bathtub.&quot; After the fall of the Robespierre government, Carrier was tried for war crimes by the Revolutionary Tribunal, found guilty, and executed.

==Early life==

Carrier was born at Yolet, a village near Aurillac in upper Auvergne, as the fourth of six children born to Jean Carrier and Marguerite Puex. As the son of a middle class tenant farmer, Carrier and his family survived on income reaped from cultivating the land of a French nobleman. After attending a Jesuit school in Aurillac, he was able to pursue a wide variety of career interests. Carrier worked in a law office in Paris until 1785 when he returned to Aurillac, married, and with the outbreak of the Revolution joined the National Guard and the Jacobin Club. In 1790 he was a country attorney (counsellor for the bailliage of Aurillac) and in 1792 was elected deputy to the National Convention from Cantal. He was already known as one of the influential members of the Cordeliers and the Jacobin Club.
After the subjugation of Flanders he was one of the commissioners nominated in the close of 1792 by the convention. He voted for the execution of King Louis XVI of France, was one of the first to call for the arrest of the Duke of Orléans and took a prominent part in the overthrow of the Girondists (on 31 May).

== Representative to Nantes ==
In 1793, Carrier was sent to Nantes as a representative on mission under orders from the National Convention. He established a revolutionary tribunal in Nantes and formed a unit of troops called the Legion of Marat, in order to suppress the revolt of anti-revolutionists and dispose quickly of prisoners in the jails. The trials were soon discontinued, and the victims were sent to the guillotine, shot, or executed in another way.

In a twenty-page letter to his fellow republicans, Carrier promised not to leave a single counter-revolutionary or monopolist (hoarders or aristocratic land owners) at large in Nantes. His action was endorsed by the Committee of Public Safety. In the following days Carrier put large numbers of prisoners aboard vessels with trap doors for bottoms, and sank them in the Loire river. These executions included priests and nuns, as well as women and children. They were known as the Drownings at Nantes. Some alleged that Carrier ordered young male and female prisoners be tied together naked before the drownings, a method which was called a &quot;republican marriage&quot;, but this accusation was later found to be a rumor started by counter-revolutionaries.

He was described by Adolphe Thiers as being &quot;one of those inferior and violent spirits, who in the excitement of civil wars become monsters of cruelty and extravagance.&quot;

==Trial and execution==

In 1794, a member of the Committee of Public Safety returned from Nantes with information about the atrocities being carried out, although Carrier himself was not put on trial. On 8 February 1794, Carrier was recalled to Paris by Robespierre. A few months later, the Thermidorian reaction led to the fall of Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety. Carrier&#x27;s position became exposed. Prisoners he had brought from Nantes were acquitted and released, and more people denounced Carrier&#x27;s actions. On 3 September 1794 Carrier was arrested.

At his trial before the Revolutionary Tribunal, Carrier was quick to denounce allegations of inhumanity, stating &quot;I took but little share in the policing of Nantes; I was only there in passing, being first at Rennes and later with the army. My principal task was to watch over and see to the victualing of our troops, and for six months I supplied 200,000 men there without its costing the State a halfpenny. Hence I have little information to offer in the matter. I know little or nothing of the accused.&quot; After this statement, a fellow representative, Phélippes, vocally charged Carrier with drownings, wholesale executions, demolitions, thefts, pillaging, laying waste to Nantes, famine and disorder, and the butchering of women and children. Men from the &quot;Marat Company,&quot; a militia that Carrier used to purge Nantes, were present during the trial, including Perro-Chaux, Lévêque, Bollogniel, Grandmaison, and Mainguet. All were part of the Revolutionary Committee of Nantes, appointed directly or indirectly by Carrier. The jury passed a unanimous vote for Carrier&#x27;s execution.

The Revolutionary Tribunal declared him guilty of, among other crimes, mass executions of citizens who did not fight against the Republic, through drownings and firing squads. They declared these executions to have been carried out &quot;knowingly, viciously, and with counter-revolutionary intent.&quot; Along with two accomplices from the revolutionary committee of Nantes, Carrier was executed by the guillotine in Paris, on 16 December 1794.

<text>Ailuropoda is the only extant genus in the ursid (bear) subfamily Ailuropodinae. It contains one living and one or more fossil species of panda.

Only one species—&quot;Ailuropoda melanoleuca&quot;—currently exists; the other three species are prehistoric chronospecies. Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda has a diet that is primarily herbivorous, which consists almost exclusively of bamboo.

Giant pandas have descended from &quot;Ailurarctos&quot;, which lived during the late Miocene.

==Etymology==

From Greek &quot;cat&quot; + &quot;foot&quot; (gen. sg.). Unlike most bears, giant pandas do not have round pupils, but instead have vertical slits, similar to those of cats. This has not only inspired the scientific name, but in Chinese the giant panda is called &quot;large bear cat&quot; (, ).

==Classification==
*†&quot;Ailuropoda microta&quot; (late Pliocene)
*†&quot;Ailuropoda wulingshanensis&quot; (late Pliocene–early Pleistocene)
*†&quot;Ailuropoda baconi&quot; (Pleistocene)
*&quot;Ailuropoda melanoleuca&quot; (giant panda) 
**&quot;Ailuropoda melanoleuca melanoleuca&quot; 
**&quot;Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis&quot; 

Alternatively, &quot;Ailuropoda wulingshanensis&quot; and &quot;Ailuropoda baconi&quot; may be treated as subspecies of &quot;Ailuropoda melanoleuca&quot;.

==Other pandas==
The red, or lesser panda (&quot;Ailurus fulgens&quot;) was formerly considered closely related to the giant panda. It is no longer considered a bear, however, and is now classified as the sole living representative of a different carnivore family (Ailuridae).

<text>Education in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with each of the countries of the United Kingdom having separate systems under separate governments. The UK Government is responsible for England, whilst the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government and the Northern Ireland Executive are responsible for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively.

For details of education in each country, see:
* Education in England
* Education in Northern Ireland
* Education in Scotland
* Education in Wales

In 2018, the Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked the overall knowledge and skills of British 15-year-olds as 13th in the world in reading, literacy, mathematics, and science. The average British student scored 503.7, compared with the OECD average of 493.

In 2014, the country spent 6.6% of its GDP on all levels of education – 1.4 percentage points above the OECD average of 5.2%. In 2017, 45.7% of British people aged 25 to 64 had attended some form of post-secondary education. Of British people aged 25 to 64, 22.6% had attained a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, whilst 52% of British people aged 25 to 34 had attended some form of tertiary education, about 4% above the OECD average of 44%.

== History ==

Education was listed as a charitable purpose by the Parliament of England in the Charitable Uses Act 1601.

==Stages==
In each country there are five stages of education: early years, primary, secondary, further education (FE) and higher education (HE). The law states that full-time education is compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 (4 in Northern Ireland) and 16. In England, compulsory education or training was extended to 18 in 2015. Before they reach compulsory school age, children can be educated at nursery; the four governments all provide universal funding for children from the age of three years old or younger. 

Further education is non-compulsory, and covers advanced education which can be taken at further (including tertiary) education colleges and higher education institutions (HEIs). The fifth stage, higher education, is study beyond A-levels or BTECs (and their equivalent) which, for most full-time students, takes place in HEIs such as universities and colleges.

The National Curriculum, established in 1988, provides a framework for education in England between the ages of 5 and 16. Although the curriculum is compulsory, some private schools, home educators, academies and free schools design their own curricula. Following devolution in 1999, the Welsh Government took responsibility for education in Wales and the curriculum began to differ from that of England. The National Curriculum for Wales was established and is now being succeeded by the Curriculum for Wales.

In Scotland, the equivalent is the Curriculum for Excellence. Scotland&#x27;s qualifications system of National 4/5s, Highers and Advanced Highers are very similar to Advanced Subsidiary (AS) and Advanced Level (A2) courses in England.

The Northern Ireland Curriculum is a separate system.

==Further education==
Further education (FE) refers to post-secondary education in England and Wales. FE may include the study of apprenticeships, A-levels, BTEC, International Baccalaureate, NVQ or others, ranging from entry level to the highest level (Level 3, equivalent to A-level) and aim to prepare students for higher education. The sixth form is one type of FE, which includes post-16 study that is undertaken after completing GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education). Sixth form may be offered by sixth form colleges or by schools which teach the 11–18 age-range and have an attached sixth form. Further education colleges generally provide a wider curriculum and have a wider range of options for FE, including vocational forms of education (such as NVQs). Tertiary colleges provide both academic and vocational courses.

==Higher education==
In the United Kingdom, higher education is offered by universities and other institutions (colleges, institutes, schools, and academies) and includes both research-oriented and higher professional education. Universities provide programmes that lead to a degree (bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, or doctorate) and non-degree programmes that lead to a vocational qualification such as a certificate or diploma. British higher education is valued around the globe for its quality and rigorous academic standards. Several British universities are ranked among the top universities in the world, including the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, Imperial College London, and UCL.

===Entry qualifications===
In 2023, most students who sat for GCSEs undertook 9 subjects. In 2023, the most common combination of three subjects that was undertaken by students included: 1) English Language, 2) English Literature and 3) Mathematics, with 61.2% of students studying these three subjects in combination. 

Sitting the exam represents the end of 11 years of mandatory education. A General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), or Higher in Scotland, is awarded for each subject passed and World Education Services issues a high school diploma after the evaluation of a minimum of three GCSEs. Pre-university education in the United Kingdom is a two-year senior secondary programme that leads to a new round of examinations, the General Certificate of Education, Advanced Level (A-levels), or the Advanced Highers in Scotland. As with the GCSE, students who sit for the exam choose the subjects and the number of advanced examinations. In 2022, students who sat for A-Levels averagely undertook 2.64 subjects. WES awards undergraduate credit based on the nature and number of subjects passed. Each university has their own set of admission policies and the minimum entry requirements for each particular higher education programme that they offer. The A-Level is an entry qualification for universities in the United Kingdom and many other universities across the world. Students that are interested in pursuing higher education will usually enrol in pre-university and further education programmes.

===Vocational===
Technical and vocational education in the United Kingdom is introduced during the secondary school years and goes on until further and higher education. Secondary vocational education is also known as further education. It is separate from secondary education and does not belong to the category of higher education. Further education incorporates vocational oriented education as well as a combination of general secondary education. Students can also go on to a further education college to prepare themselves for the Vocational Certificate of Education (VCE), which is similar to the A-levels. Major provider of vocational qualifications in the United Kingdom include the City and Guilds of London Institute and Edexcel. Higher National Certificates and Higher National Diplomas typically require 1 and 2 years of full-time study and credit from either HNE or Diplomas can be transferred toward an undergraduate degree. Along with the HNC and HND, students who are interested in other vocational qualifications may pursue a Foundation degree, which is a qualification that trains people to be highly skilled technicians. The National Apprenticeship Service also offers vocational education where people at ages of 16 and older enter apprenticeships in order to learn a skilled trade. There are over 60 different certifications can be obtained through an apprenticeship, which typically lasts from 1 to 3 years. Trades apprentices receive paid wages during training and spend one day at school and the rest in the workplace to hone their skills.

T Levels are a technical qualification being introduced between Autumn 2020 and 2023. They are intended to provide the knowledge and experience needed for learners to progress to skilled employment, further study or a higher apprenticeship.

==Inequality==
In 2018 &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that successful schools tend to choose pupils from high–achieving backgrounds. Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, and challenging pupils, tend to be concentrated in schools that do less well in inspections. Also that children from prosperous backgrounds are more likely to be in good or outstanding schools while disadvantaged children are more likely to be in inadequate schools. The inequality gap as of 2015 is closing with more students in good or outstanding schools from all social backgrounds.

A 2016 report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission said that racial inequality exists in the Great Britain education system. It was found that 6% of Black school leavers went on to attend a Russell Group university, compared with 12% of mixed race and Asian school leavers, and 11% of White school leavers. In 2009, it was found that White students&#x27; predicted A-Level grades were 53% accurate, whilst Black students&#x27; received predicted grades that were 39.1% accurate. Black students are also the most likely to receive under-predicted grades by their teachers. It was found that 7.1% of Black students received higher actual grades compared to 6.6% of White students, 6.5% of Asian students and 6.1% of Mixed students. In 2018, of all teachers in state-funded schools in England, 14.1% were from BAME groups. 33.5% of primary school and 31.3% of secondary school pupils in England were from BAME groups.

== Funding ==
In 2015/16, the UK spent £3.2 billion on early years education, £27.7 billion on primary education, £38.2 billion on secondary education and £5.9 billion on tertiary education. In total, the UK spent £83.4 billion on education (includes £8.4 billion on other categories).

== International students ==

Schools and universities in Britain are popular destinations for international students. The country&#x27;s universities and colleges have educated many heads of state and government around the world, rivalled only by the United States.

<doc id="339553" wikidata="Q337517" url="?curid=339553" title="Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS">
<text>HIV tests are used to detect the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes HIV/AIDS, in serum, saliva, or urine. Such tests may detect antibodies, antigens, or RNA.

==AIDS diagnosis==

AIDS is diagnosed separately from HIV.

== Terminology ==

The eclipse period is a variable period starting from HIV exposure in which no existing test can detect HIV. The median duration of the eclipse period in one study was 11.5 days. The window period is the time between HIV exposure and when an antibody or antigen test can detect HIV. The median window period for antibody/antigen testing is 18 days. Nucleic acid testing (NAT) further reduces this period to 11.5 days.

Performance of medical tests is often described in terms of:
* Sensitivity: The percentage of the results that will be positive when HIV is present
* Specificity: The percentage of the results that will be negative when HIV is not present.

All diagnostic tests have limitations, and sometimes their use may produce erroneous or questionable results.
* False positive: The test incorrectly indicates that HIV is present in a non-infected person.
* False negative: The test incorrectly indicates that HIV is absent in an infected person.

Nonspecific reactions, hypergammaglobulinemia, or the presence of antibodies directed to other infectious agents that may be antigenically similar to HIV can produce false positive results. Autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, have also rarely caused false positive results. Most false negative results are due to the window period.

== Principles ==

=== Screening donor blood and cellular products ===

Tests selected to screen donor blood and tissue must provide a high degree of confidence that HIV will be detected if present (that is, a high sensitivity is required). A combination of antibody, antigen and nucleic acid tests are used by blood banks in Western countries. The World Health Organization estimated that, , inadequate blood screening had resulted in 1 million new HIV infections worldwide.

In the US, the Food and Drug Administration requires that all donated blood be screened for several infectious diseases, including HIV-1 and HIV-2, using a combination of antibody testing (EIA) and more expeditious nucleic acid testing (NAT). These diagnostic tests are combined with careful donor selection. , the risk of transfusion-acquired HIV in the US was approximately one in 2.5 million for each transfusion.

=== Diagnosis of HIV infection ===
Tests used for the diagnosis of HIV infection in a particular person require a high degree of both sensitivity and specificity. In the United States, this is achieved using an algorithm combining two tests for HIV antibodies. If antibodies are detected by an initial test based on the ELISA method, then a second test using the western blot procedure determines the size of the antigens in the test kit binding to the antibodies. The combination of these two methods is highly accurate 

=== Human rights ===
The UNAIDS/WHO policy statement on HIV Testing states that conditions under which people undergo HIV testing must be anchored in a human rights approach that pays due respect to ethical principles. According to these principles, the conduct of HIV testing of individuals must be
* Confidential;
* Accompanied by counseling (for those who test positive);
* Conducted with the informed consent of the person being tested.

=== Confidentiality ===

Considerable controversy exists over the ethical obligations of health care providers to inform the sexual partners of individuals infected with HIV that they are at risk of contracting the virus.
Some legal jurisdictions permit such disclosure, while others do not. More state funded testing sites are now using confidential forms of testing. This allows for monitoring of infected individuals easily, compared to anonymous testing that has a number attached to the positive test results. Controversy exists over privacy issues.

In developing countries, home-based HIV testing and counseling (HBHTC) is an emerging approach for addressing confidentiality issues. HBHTC allows individuals, couples, and families to learn their HIV status in the convenience and privacy of their home environment. Rapid HIV tests are most often used, so results are available for the client between 15 and 30 minutes. Furthermore, when an HIV-positive result is communicated, the HTC provider can offer appropriate linkages for prevention, care, and treatment.

===Anonymous testing===
Anonymous testing may be available for people who wish to take an HIV test without giving their name. Instead of providing a name, the person undergoing the test receives a number and then presents that number to obtain the results of the test, which do not contain the person&#x27;s name.

=== Routine testing recommendation ===
In the United States, one emerging standard of care is to screen all patients for HIV in all health care settings.
In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced an initiative for voluntary, routine testing of all Americans aged 13–64 during health care encounters. An estimated 25% of infected individuals were unaware of their status; if successful, this effort was expected to reduce new infections by 30% per year. The CDC recommends elimination of requirements for written consent or extensive pre-test counseling as barriers to widespread routine testing. In 2006, the National Association of Community Health Centers implemented a model for offering free, rapid HIV testing to all patients between the ages of 13 and 64 during routine primary medical and dental care visits. The program increased testing rates, with 66% of the 17,237 patients involved in the study agreeing to testing (56% were tested for the first time). In September 2010, New York became the first state to require that hospitals and primary care providers offer an HIV test to all patients between the ages of 13 and 64 years. An evaluation of the law&#x27;s impact found that it increased testing significantly throughout the state.

== Antibody tests ==
HIV antibody tests are specifically designed for routine diagnostic testing of adults; these tests are inexpensive and extremely accurate.

=== Window period ===
Antibody tests may give false negative (no antibodies were detected despite the presence of HIV) results during the &quot;window period&quot;, hence an interval of three weeks to six months between the time of HIV exposure and the production of measurable antibodies to HIV seroconversion is implemented. Most people develop detectable antibodies approximately 18 to 30 days after exposure, although some do seroconvert later. The vast majority of people (99%) have detectable antibodies by two months after HIV exposure.

During the window period, an infected person can transmit HIV to others although their HIV infection may not be detectable with an antibody test. Antiretroviral therapy during the window period can delay the formation of antibodies and extend the window period beyond 12 months. This was not the case with patients that underwent treatment with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Those patients must take ELISA tests at various intervals after the usual 28-day course of treatment, sometimes extending outside of the conservative window period of 6 months.

=== ELISA ===
The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or enzyme immunoassay (EIA), was the first screening test commonly employed for HIV. It has a high sensitivity.

In an ELISA test, a person&#x27;s serum is diluted 400-fold and applied to a plate to which HIV antigens have been attached. If antibodies to HIV are present in the serum, they may bind to these HIV antigens. The plate is then washed to remove all other components of the serum. A specially prepared &quot;secondary antibody&quot; – an antibody that binds to human antibodies – is then applied to the plate, followed by another wash. This secondary antibody is chemically linked in advance to an enzyme. Thus the plate will contain enzyme in proportion to the amount of secondary antibody bound to the plate. A substrate for the enzyme is applied, and catalysis by the enzyme leads to a change in color or fluorescence. ELISA results are reported as a number; the most controversial aspect of this test is determining the &quot;cut-off&quot; point between a positive and negative result.

===ELISA dongle===
Researchers from Columbia University have produced an ELISA test dongle capable of testing for HIV and syphilis. It is compatible to any smartphone or computer without additional support or battery power, and takes some fifteen minutes to analyse a drop of blood. The units cost approximately $34 each to manufacture.

=== Western blot ===

Like the ELISA procedure, the western blot is an antibody detection test. However, unlike the ELISA method, the viral proteins are separated first and immobilized. In subsequent steps, the binding of serum antibodies to specific HIV proteins is visualized.

Specifically, cells that may be HIV-infected are opened and the proteins within are placed into a slab of gel, to which an electric current is applied. Different proteins will move with different speeds in this field, depending on their size, while their electrical charge is leveled by a surfactant called sodium lauryl sulfate. Some commercially prepared Western blot test kits contain the HIV proteins already on a cellulose acetate strip. Once the proteins are well-separated, they are transferred to a membrane and the procedure continues similar to an ELISA: the person&#x27;s diluted serum is applied to the membrane and antibodies in the serum may attach to some of the HIV proteins. Antibodies that do not attach are washed away, and enzyme-linked antibodies with the capability to attach to the person&#x27;s antibodies determine to which HIV proteins the person has antibodies.

There are no universal criteria for interpreting the western blot test: The number of viral bands that must be present may vary. If no viral bands are detected, the result is negative. If at least one viral band for each of the GAG, POL, and ENV gene-product groups are present, the result is positive. The three-gene-product approach to western blot interpretation has not been adopted for public health or clinical practice. Tests in which less than the required number of viral bands are detected are reported as indeterminate: a person who has an indeterminate result should be retested, as later tests may be more conclusive. Almost all HIV-infected persons with indeterminate western blot results will develop a positive result when tested in one month; persistently indeterminate results over a period of six months suggests the results are not due to HIV infection. In a generally healthy low-risk population, indeterminate results on western blot occur on the order of 1 in 5,000 patients. However, for those individuals who have had high-risk exposures to individuals where HIV-2 is most prevalent, Western Africa, an inconclusive western blot test may prove infection with HIV-2.
The HIV proteins used in western blotting can be produced by recombinant DNA in a technique called &quot;recombinant immunoblot assay&quot; (RIBA).

===Rapid or point-of-care tests===
Rapid antibody tests are qualitative immunoassays intended for use in point-of-care testing to aid in the diagnosis of HIV infection. These tests should be used in conjunction with the clinical status, history, and risk factors of the person being tested. The positive predictive value of Rapid Antibody Tests in low-risk populations has not been evaluated. These tests should be used in appropriate multi-test algorithms designed for statistical validation of rapid HIV test results.

If no antibodies to HIV are detected, this does not mean the person has not been infected with HIV. It may take several months after HIV infection for the antibody response to reach detectable levels, during which time rapid testing for antibodies to HIV will not be indicative of true infection status. For most people, HIV antibodies reach a detectable level after two to six weeks.

Although these tests have high specificity, false positives do occur. Any positive test result should be confirmed by a lab using the western blot.

=== Interpreting antibody tests ===
ELISA testing alone cannot be used to diagnose HIV, even if the test suggests a high probability that antibody to HIV-1 is present. In the United States, such ELISA results are not reported as &quot;positive&quot; unless confirmed by a western blot.

The ELISA antibody tests were developed to provide a high level of confidence that donated blood was &quot;not&quot; infected with HIV. It is therefore not possible to conclude that blood rejected for transfusion because of a &quot;positive&quot; ELISA antibody test is in fact infected with HIV. Sometimes, retesting the donor in several months will produce a &quot;negative&quot; ELISA antibody test. This is why a confirmatory western blot is always used before reporting a &quot;positive&quot; HIV test result.

Rare false positive results due to factors unrelated to HIV exposure are found more often with the ELISA test than with the western blot. False positives may be associated with medical conditions such as recent acute illnesses and allergies. A rash of false positive tests in the fall of 1991 was initially blamed on the influenza vaccines used during that flu season, but further investigation traced the cross-reactivity to several relatively non-specific test kits.
A false positive result does not indicate a condition of significant risk to health. When the ELISA test is combined with Western Blot, the rate of false positives is extremely low, and diagnostic accuracy is very high (see below).
:HIV antibody tests are highly sensitive, meaning they react preferentially with HIV antibodies, but not all positive or inconclusive HIV ELISA tests mean the person is infected by HIV. Risk history, and clinical judgement should be included in the assessment, and a confirmation test (western blot) should be administered. An individual with an inconclusive test should be re-tested at a later date.

=== Accuracy of HIV testing ===
Modern HIV testing is highly accurate. The evidence regarding the risks and benefits of HIV screening was reviewed in July 2005 by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The authors concluded that:
The specificity rate given here for the inexpensive enzyme immunoassay screening tests indicates that, in 1,000 HIV test results of healthy individuals, about 15 of these results will be a false positive. Confirming the test result (i.e., by repeating the test, if this option is available) could reduce the ultimate likelihood of a false positive to about 1 result in 250,000 tests given. The sensitivity rating, likewise, indicates that, in 1,000 test results of HIV infected people, 3 will actually be a false negative result. However, based upon the HIV prevalence rates at most testing centers within the United States, the negative predictive value of these tests is extremely high, meaning that a negative test result will be correct more than 9,997 times in 10,000 (99.97% of the time). The very high negative predictive value of these tests is why the CDC recommends that a negative test result be considered conclusive evidence that an individual does not have HIV.

Of course, the actual numbers vary depending on the testing population. This is because interpreting of the results of any medical test (assuming no test is 100% accurate) depends upon the initial degree of belief, or the prior probability that an individual has, or does not have a disease. Generally the prior probability is estimated using the prevalence of a disease within a population or at a given testing location. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of all tests, including HIV tests, take into account the prior probability of having a disease along with the accuracy of the testing method to determine a new degree of belief that an individual has or does not have a disease (also known as the posterior probability). The chance that a positive test accurately indicates an HIV infection increases as the prevalence or rate of HIV infection increases in the population. Conversely, the negative predictive value will decrease as the HIV prevalence rises. Thus a positive test in a high-risk population, such as people who frequently engage in unprotected anal intercourse with unknown partners, is more likely to correctly represent HIV infection than a positive test in a very low-risk population, such as unpaid blood donors.

Many studies have confirmed the accuracy of current methods of HIV testing in the United States, reporting false-positive rates of 0.0004 to 0.0007 and false-negative rates of 0.003 in the general population.

== Antigen tests ==
The p24 antigen test detects the presence of the p24 protein of HIV (also known as CA), the capsid protein of the virus. Monoclonal antibodies specific to the p24 protein are mixed with the person&#x27;s blood. Any p24 protein in the person&#x27;s blood will stick to the monoclonal antibody and an enzyme-linked antibody to the monoclonal antibodies to p24 causes a color change if p24 was present in the sample.

In blood donation screening, this test is no longer used routinely in the US or the EU since the objective was to reduce the risk of false negatives in the window period. Nucleic acid testing (NAT) is more effective for this purpose, and p24 antigen testing is no longer indicated if a NAT test is performed.

In general diagnostics, p24 antigen tests are used for early detection of HIV, as p24 antigen rises soon after infection relative to antibodies, and the test is often used in combination with an antibody test to effectively cover a longer portion of the window period. It is less useful as a standalone test, as it has low sensitivity and only works during the early time period after infection. The presence of p24 antigen diminishes as the body increases production of antibodies to the p24 protein, making p24 more difficult to detect later.

== Antigen/antibody combination tests ==
A combination, or 4th generation assay, is designed to detect both the p24 antigen and HIV antibodies in a single test. Combination tests can detect HIV as early as 2–6 weeks after infection, and are recommended in laboratory testing.

== Nucleic acid-based tests (NAT) ==

Nucleic-acid-based tests amplify and detect one or more of several target sequences located in specific HIV genes, such as HIV-I GAG, HIV-II GAG, HIV-env, or the HIV-pol. Since these tests are relatively expensive, the blood is screened by first pooling some 8–24 samples and testing these together; if the pool tests positive, each sample is retested individually. Although this results in a dramatic decrease in cost, the dilution of the virus in the pooled samples decreases the effective sensitivity of the test, lengthening the window period by four days (assuming a 20-fold dilution, ~20hr virus doubling time, detection limit 50 copies/ml, making limit of detection 1,000 copies/ml). Since 2001, donated blood in the United States has been screened with nucleic-acid-based tests, shortening the window period between infection and detectability of disease to a median of 17 days (95% CI, 13–28 Days, assumes pooling of samples). A different version of this test is intended for use in conjunction with clinical presentation and other laboratory markers of disease progress for the management of -infected patients.

In the RT-PCR test, viral RNA is extracted from the patient&#x27;s plasma and is treated with reverse transcriptase (RT) to convert the viral RNA into cDNA. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process is then applied, using two primers unique to the virus&#x27;s genome. After PCR amplification is complete, the resulting DNA products are hybridized to specific oligonucleotides bound to the vessel wall, and are then made visible with a probe bound to an enzyme. The amount of virus in the sample can be quantified with sufficient accuracy to detect threefold changes.

In the Quantiplex bDNA or branched DNA test, plasma is placed in a centrifuge to concentrate the virus, which is then opened to release its RNA. Special oligonucleotides that bind to viral RNA and to certain oligonucleotides bound to the wall of the vessel are added. In this way, viral RNA is fastened to the wall. Then new oligonucleotides that bind at several locations to this RNA are added, and other oligonucleotides that bind at several locations to those oligonucleotides. This is done to amplify the signal. Finally, oligonucleotides that bind to the last set of oligonucleotides and that are bound to an enzyme are added; the enzyme action causes a color reaction, which allows quantification of the viral RNA in the original sample. Monitoring the effects of antiretroviral therapy by serial measurements of plasma HIV-1 RNA with this test has been validated for patients with viral loads greater than 25,000 copies per milliliter.

==Screening==
The South African government announced a plan to start screening for HIV in secondary schools by March 2011. This plan was cancelled due to concerns it would invade pupils&#x27; privacy, schools typically don&#x27;t have the facilities to securely store such information, and schools generally do not have the capacity to provide counseling for HIV-positive pupils. In South Africa, anyone over the age of 12 may request an HIV test without parental knowledge or consent. Some 80,000 pupils in three provinces were tested under this programme before it ended.

== Other tests used in HIV treatment ==
The CD4 T-cell count is not an HIV test, but rather a procedure where the number of CD4 T-cells in the blood is determined.

A CD4 count does not check for the presence of HIV. It is used to monitor immune system function in HIV-positive people. Declining CD4 T-cell counts are considered to be a marker of progression of HIV infection. A normal CD4 count can range from 500 cells/mm3 to 1000 cells/mm3. In HIV-positive people, AIDS is officially diagnosed when the count drops below 200 cells/μL or when certain opportunistic infections occur. This use of a CD4 count as an AIDS criterion was introduced in 1992; the value of 200 was chosen because it corresponded with a greatly increased likelihood of opportunistic infection. Lower CD4 counts in people with AIDS are indicators that prophylaxis against certain types of opportunistic infections should be instituted.

Low CD4 T-cell counts are associated with a variety of conditions, including many viral infections, bacterial infections, parasitic infections, primary immunodeficiency, coccidioidomycosis, burns, trauma, intravenous injections of foreign proteins, malnutrition, over-exercising, pregnancy, normal daily variation, psychological stress, and social isolation.

This test is also used occasionally to estimate immune system function for people whose CD4 T cells are impaired for reasons other than HIV infection, which include several blood diseases, several genetic disorders, and the side effects of many chemotherapy drugs.

In general, the lower the number of T cells the lower the immune system&#x27;s function will be. Normal CD4 counts are between 500 and 1500 CD4+ T cells/microliter, and the counts may fluctuate in healthy people, depending on recent infection status, nutrition, exercise, and other factors. Women tend to have somewhat lower counts than men.

==Criticisms==

=== Oral tests ===

As a result of an increase in false positive rates with rapid oral HIV testing in 2005, New York City&#x27;s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene added the option of testing finger-stick whole blood after any reactive result, before using a western blot test to confirm the positive result. Following a further increase of false positives in NYC DOHMH STD Clinics during the end of 2007 and beginning of 2008, their clinics opted to forgo further oral screenings, and instead reinstituted testing using finger-stick whole blood. Despite the increase in false positives in NYC DOHMH, the CDC still continues to support the use of noninvasive oral fluid specimens due to their popularity in health clinics and convenience of use. The director of the HIV control program for public health at Seattle King county, reported OraQuick failed to spot at least 8 percent of 133 people found to be infected with a comparable diagnostic test. Strategies implemented to determine quality control and false positive rates were implemented. It is to be understood that any reactive OraQuick test result is a preliminary positive result and will always require a confirmatory test, regardless of the mean of testing (venipuncture whole blood, fingerstick whole blood or oral mucosal transudate fluid). Several other testing sites who did not experience a spike in false positive rates continue to use OraSure&#x27;s OraQuick HIV Anti-body Testing.

=== AIDS denialism ===
HIV tests have been criticized by AIDS denialists (a fringe group whose members believe that HIV either does not exist or is harmless). The accuracy of serologic testing has been verified by isolation and culture of HIV and by detection of HIV RNA by PCR, which are widely accepted &quot;gold standards&quot; in microbiology. While AIDS denialists focus on individual components of HIV testing, the combination of ELISA and western blot used for the diagnosis of HIV is remarkably accurate, with very low false-positive and -negative rates as described above. The views of AIDS denialists are based on highly selective analysis of mostly outdated scientific papers; there is broad scientific consensus that HIV is the cause of AIDS.

== Fraudulent testing ==
There have been a number of cases of fraudulent tests being sold via mail order or the Internet to the general public. In 1997, a California man was indicted on mail fraud and wire charges for selling supposed home test kits. In 2004, the US Federal Trade Commission asked Federal Express and US Customs to confiscate shipments of the Discreet home HIV test kits, produced by Gregory Stephen Wong of Vancouver, Canada. In February 2005, the US FDA issued a warning against using the rapid HIV test kits and other home use kits marketed by Globus Media of Montreal, Canada.

<text>A bar council () or bar association, in a common law jurisdiction with a legal profession split between solicitors and barristers or advocates, is a professional body that regulates the profession of barristers. In such jurisdictions, solicitors are generally regulated by the law society.

In common law jurisdictions with no distinction between barristers and solicitors (i.e. where there is a &quot;fused profession&quot;), the professional body may be called variously a &quot;Law Society&quot;, &quot;Bar Council&quot; or a &quot;bar association&quot;.

==List of some bar councils and bar associations==
The following are bar councils and bar associations that are professional bodies for barristers in common law jurisdictions with a split legal profession.

<text>A hedge or hedgerow is a line of closely spaced (3 feet or closer) shrubs and sometimes trees, planted and trained to form a barrier or to mark the boundary of an area, such as between neighbouring properties. Hedges that are used to separate a road from adjoining fields or one field from another, and are of sufficient age to incorporate larger trees, are known as hedgerows. Often they serve as windbreaks to improve conditions for the adjacent crops, as in bocage country. When clipped and maintained, hedges are also a simple form of topiary.

A hedge often operates as, and sometimes is called, a &quot;live fence&quot;. This may either consist of individual fence posts connected with wire or other fencing material, or it may be in the form of densely planted hedges without interconnecting wire. This is common in tropical areas where low-income farmers can demarcate properties and reduce maintenance of fence posts that otherwise deteriorate rapidly. Many other benefits can be obtained depending on the species chosen.

==History==
The development of hedges over the centuries is preserved in their structure. The first hedges enclosed land for cereal crops during the Neolithic Age (4000–6000 years ago). The farms were of about , with fields about for hand cultivation. Some hedges date from the Bronze and Iron Ages, 2000–4000 years ago, when traditional patterns of landscape became established. Others were built during the Medieval field rationalisations; more originated in the industrial boom of the 18th and 19th centuries, when heaths and uplands were enclosed.

Many hedgerows separating fields from lanes in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Low Countries are estimated to have been in existence for more than seven hundred years, originating in the medieval period. The root word of &#x27;hedge&#x27; is much older: it appears in the Old English language, in German (&quot;Hecke&quot;), and Dutch (&quot;haag&quot;) to mean &#x27;enclosure&#x27;, as in the name of the Dutch city The Hague, or more formally&quot; &#x27;s Gravenhage&quot;, meaning &quot;The Count&#x27;s hedge&quot;. Charles the Bald is recorded as complaining in 864, at a time when most official fortifications were constructed of wooden palisades, that some unauthorized men were constructing &quot;haies et fertés&quot;; tightly interwoven hedges of hawthorns.

In parts of Britain, early hedges were destroyed to make way for the manorial open-field system. Many were replaced after the inclosure acts, then removed again during modern agricultural intensification, and now some are being replanted for wildlife. As of 2024 in a study using Lidar by the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology England alone was found to have a total of 390,000 km of hedgerows, which would span the circumference of the earth 10 times.

==Composition==
A hedge may consist of a single species or several, typically mixed at random. In many newly planted British hedges, at least 60 per cent of the shrubs are hawthorn, blackthorn, and (in the southwest) hazel, alone or in combination. The first two are particularly effective barriers to livestock. In North America, &quot;Maclura pomifera&quot; (i.e., hedge apple) was grown to form a barrier to exclude free-range livestock from vegetable gardens and corn fields. Other shrubs and trees used include holly, beech, oak, ash, and willow; the last three can become very tall. Of the hedgerows in the Normandy region of France, Martin Blumenson said

The hedgerow is a fence, half earth, half hedge. The wall at the base is a dirt parapet that varies in thickness from one to four or more feet and in height from three to twelve feet. Growing out of the wall is a hedge of hawthorn, brambles, vines, and trees, in thickness from one to three feet. Originally property demarcations, hedgerows protect crops and cattle from the ocean winds that sweep across the land.

The hedgerows of Normandy became barriers that slowed the advance of Allied troops following the D-Day invasion during World War II. Allied armed forces modified their armored vehicles to facilitate breaking out of their beachheads into the Normandy bocage.

===Species===
Formal, or modern garden hedges are grown in many varieties, including the following species:

* &quot;Berberis thunbergii&quot; – native to Japan and eastern Asia
* &quot;Buxus sempervirens&quot; (box) – native to western and southern Europe, northwest Africa, and southwest Asia, from southern England south to northern Morocco, and east through the northern Mediterranean region to Turkey.
* &quot;Carpinus betulus&quot; (European hornbeam) – native to Western Asia and central, eastern, and southern Europe, including southern England.
* &quot;Crataegus monogyna&quot; (hawthorn) – native to Europe, northwestern Africa, and West Asia
* &quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; (European green beech) – native from northern Europe, in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Bulgaria, eastern parts of Russia, Romania, through central Europe to France, southern England, northern Portugal, central Spain, and east to northwest Turkey where it intergrades with the oriental beech (Fagus orientalis)
* &quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; &#x27;Purpurea&#x27; (European purple beech) – a variant of the above 
* &quot;Ilex aquifolium&quot; (European holly) – native to western and southern Europe, northwest Africa, and southwest Asia
* &quot;Ligustrum ovalifolium&quot; (privet) – native to Japan and Korea
* &quot;Ligustrum&quot; × &quot;ibolium&quot; (north privet) – native to Japan and Korea
* &quot;Photinia&quot; × &quot;fraseri&quot; (red robin) – a hybrid between &quot;Photinia glabra&quot; and &quot;Photinia serratifolia&quot;, native to Japan and to China, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and India, respectively 
* &quot;Prunus laurocerasus&quot; (common cherry-laurel) – native to regions bordering the Black Sea in southwestern Asia and southeastern Europe, from Albania and Bulgaria east through Turkey to the Caucasus Mountains and northern Iran
* &quot;Prunus lusitanica&quot; (Portuguese cherry-laurel) – native to southwestern France, Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Macaronesia (the Azores, Canary Islands and Madeira)
* &quot;Quercus ilex&quot; (holm oak) – native to the Mediterranean region
* &quot;Taxus baccata&quot; (yew) – native to Western Europe, Central Europe and Southern Europe (including Great Britain and Ireland), Northwest Africa, northern Iran, and Southwest Asia
* &quot;Thuja occidentalis&quot; (yellow ribbon; northern white cedar) – native to eastern Canada and much of the north-central and northeastern United States
* &quot;Thuja plicata&quot; (western red cedar) – native to the Pacific Northwest of North America

=== Hedgerow trees ===

Hedgerow trees are trees that grow in hedgerows but have been allowed to reach their full height and width. There are thought to be around 1.8 million hedgerow trees in Britain (counting only those whose canopies do not touch others) with perhaps 98% of these being in England and Wales. Hedgerow trees are both an important part of the English landscape and valuable habitats for wildlife. Many hedgerow trees are veteran trees and therefore of great wildlife interest.

The most common species are English oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;) and ash (&quot;Fraxinus excelsior&quot;), though in the past field elm (&quot;Ulmus minor&quot; &#x27;Atinia&#x27;) would also have been common. Around 20 million elm trees, most of them hedgerow trees, were felled or died through Dutch elm disease in the late 1960s. Many other species are used, notably including common beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;) and various nut and fruit trees.

The age structure of British hedgerow trees is old because the number of new trees is not sufficient to replace the number of trees that are lost through age or disease.

New trees can be established by planting but it is generally more successful to leave standard trees behind when laying hedges. Trees should be left at no closer than apart and the distances should vary so as to create a more natural landscape. The distance allows the young trees to develop full crowns without competing or producing too much shade.

It is suggested that hedgerow trees cause gaps in hedges but it has been found that cutting some lower branches off lets sufficient light through to the hedge below to allow it to grow.

==Importance of hedgerows==
Hedges are recognised as part of a cultural heritage and historical record and for their great value to wildlife and the landscape. Increasingly, they are valued too for the major role they have to play in preventing soil loss and reducing pollution, and for their potential to regulate water supply and to reduce flooding. There is increased earthworm diversity in the soils under hedgerows which also help to store organic carbon and support distinct communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi.

In addition to maintaining the health of the environment, hedgerows also play a huge role in providing shelter for smaller animals like birds and insects. A recent study by Emma Coulthard mentioned the possibility that hedgerows may act as guides for moths, like &quot;Acronicta rumicis&quot;, when flying from one location to another. As moths are nocturnal, it is highly unlikely that they use visual aids as guides, but rather are following sensory or olfactory markers on the hedgerows. Larkin et al. 2013 find 100% of northwest European farms have hedges, providing 43% of the wildlife habitat there.

Historically, hedges were used as a source of firewood, and for providing shelter from wind, rain and sun for crops, farm animals and people. Today, mature hedges&#x27; uses include screening unsightly developments.

In England and Wales agricultural hedgerow removal is controlled by the Hedgerows Regulations 1997, administered by the local planning authority.

===Dating===
Hedges that have existed for hundreds of years are colonised by additional species. This may be useful as a means of determining the age of the hedge. Hooper&#x27;s rule (or Hooper&#x27;s law, named after Dr. Max Hooper) is based on ecological data obtained from hedges of known age, and suggests that the age of a hedge can be roughly estimated by counting the number of woody species in a thirty-yard section and multiplying by 110 years.

Max Hooper published his original formula in the book &quot;Hedges&quot; in 1974. This method is only a rule of thumb, and can be off by a couple of centuries; it should always be backed up by documentary evidence, if possible, and take into account other factors. Caveats include the fact that planted hedgerows, hedgerows with elm, and hedgerows in the north of England tend not to follow the rule as closely. The formula also does not work on hedges more than a thousand years old.

Hooper&#x27;s scheme is important not least for its potential use in determining what an important hedgerow is, given their protection in The Hedgerows Regulations (1997; No. 1160) of the Department of the Environment, based on age and other factors.

===Removal===

Hedgerow removal is part of the transition of arable land from low-intensity to high-intensity farming. The removal of hedgerows gives larger fields making the sowing and harvesting of crops easier, faster and cheaper, and giving a larger area to grow the crops, increasing yield and profits.

Hedgerows serve as important wildlife corridors, especially in the United Kingdom where they link the country&#x27;s fractured ancient woodland. They also serve as a habitat for birds and other animals. As the land within a few metres of hedges is difficult to plough, sow, or spray with herbicides, the land around hedges also typically includes high plant biodiversity. Hedges also serve to stabilise the soil and on slopes help prevent soil creep and leaching of minerals and plant nutrients. Removal thus weakens the soil and leads to erosion.

In the United Kingdom hedgerow removal has been occurring since World War I as technology made intensive farming possible, and the increasing population demanded more food from the land. The trend has slowed down somewhat since the 1980s when cheap food imports reduced the demand on British farmland, and as the European Union Common Agricultural Policy made environmental projects financially viable. Under reforms to national and EU agricultural policies, the environmental impact of farming features more highly and in many places hedgerow conservation and replanting is taking place.

In England and Wales agricultural hedgerow removal is controlled by the Hedgerows Regulations 1997, administered by the local planning authority.

==Hedge laying==

If hedges are not maintained and trimmed regularly, gaps tend to form at the base over many years. In essence, hedgelaying consists of cutting most of the way through the stem of each plant near the base, bending it over and interweaving or pleaching it between wooden stakes. This also encourages new growth from the base of each plant. Originally, the main purpose of hedgelaying was to ensure the hedge remained stock-proof. Some side branches were also removed and used as firewood.

The maintenance and laying of hedges to form an impenetrable barrier for farm animals is a skilled art. In Britain there are many local hedgelaying traditions, each with a distinct style. Hedges are still being laid today not only for aesthetic and functional purposes but also for their ecological role in helping wildlife and protecting against soil erosion.

===Hedge trimming===
An alternative to hedge laying is trimming using a tractor-mounted flail cutter or circular saw, or a hedge trimmer. The height of the cutting can be increased a little every year. Trimming a hedge helps to promote bushy growth. If a flail cutter is used, then the flail must be kept sharp to ensure that the cutting is effective on the hedge. The disadvantage of this is that the hedge species takes a number of years before it will flower again and subsequently bear fruit for wildlife and people. If the hedge is trimmed repeatedly at the same height, a &#x27;hard knuckle&#x27; will start to form at that height – similar to the shape of a pollarded tree. Additionally, hedge trimming causes habitat destruction to species like the small eggar moth which spend nearly their entire life cycle in blackthorn and hawthorn hedgerow. This has led to a decline in the moth&#x27;s population. It is now nationally scarce in Britain.

===General hedge management===
A &#x27;hedgerow management&#x27; scale has been devised by an organisation called Hedgelink UK ranging from 1 to 10. &#x27;1&#x27; describes the action to take for a heavily over trimmed hedge, &#x27;5&#x27; is a healthy dense hedgerow more than 2 metres in height, and &#x27;10&#x27; is a hedge that has not been managed at all and has become a line of trees.

The RSPB suggest that hedges in Britain not be cut between March and August. This is to protect nesting birds, which are protected by law.

===Coppicing===
The techniques of coppicing and hard pollarding can be used to rejuvenate a hedge where hedge laying is not appropriate.

==Types==
=== Instant hedge ===
The term &quot;instant hedge&quot; has become known since early this century for hedging plants that are planted collectively in such a way as to form a mature hedge from the moment they are planted together, with a height of at least 1.2 metres. They are usually created from hedging elements or individual plants which means very few are actually hedges from the start, as the plants need time to grow and entwine to form a real hedge.

An example of an instant hedge can be seen at the Elveden Hall Estate in East Anglia, where fields of hedges can be seen growing in cultivated rows, since 1998. The development of this type of mature hedge has led to such products being specified by landscape architects, garden designers, property developers, insurance companies, sports clubs, schools and local councils, as well as many private home owners. Demand has also increased from planning authorities in specifying to developers that mature hedges are planted rather than just whips (a slender, unbranched shoot or plant).

A &#x27;real&#x27; instant hedge could be defined as having a managed root growth system allowing the hedge to be sold with a continuous rootstrips (rather than individual plants) which then enables year-round planting. During its circa 8-year production time, all stock should be irrigated, clipped and treated with controlled-release nutrients to optimise health.

===Quickset hedge===
A quickset hedge is a type of hedge created by planting live whitethorn (common hawthorn) cuttings directly into the earth (hazel does not sprout from cuttings). Once planted, these cuttings root and form new plants, creating a dense barrier. The technique is ancient, and the term &quot;quickset hedge&quot; is first recorded in 1484. The word &quot;quick&quot; in the name refers to the fact that the cuttings are living (as in &quot;the quick and the dead&quot;), and not to the speed at which the hedge grows, although it will establish quite rapidly. An alternative meaning of quickset hedging is any hedge formed of living plants or of living plants combined with a fence. The technique of quicksetting can also be used for many other shrubs and trees.

===Devon hedge===

A Devon hedge is an earth bank topped with shrubs. The bank may be faced with turf or stone. When stone-faced, the stones are generally placed on edge, often laid flat around gateways.

A quarter of Devon&#x27;s hedges are thought to be over 800 years old. There are approximately 33,000 miles (53,000 km) of Devon hedge, which is more than any other county. Traditional farming throughout the county has meant that fewer Devon hedges have been removed than elsewhere.

Devon hedges are particularly important for wildlife habitat. Around 20% of the UK&#x27;s species-rich hedges occur within Devon. Over 600 species of flowering plants, 1500 species of insects, 65 species of birds and 20 species of mammals have been recorded living or feeding in Devon hedges.

Hedge laying in Devon is usually referred to as steeping and involves cutting and laying steepers (the stems) along the top of the bank and securing them with crooks (forked sticks).

===Cornish hedge===

A Cornish hedge is an earth bank with stones. It normally consists of large stone blocks constructed either side of a narrow earth bank, and held in place with interlocking stones. The neat rows of square stones at the top are called &quot;edgers&quot;. The top of the hedge is planted with grass turf.

Sometimes hedging plants or trees are planted on the hedge to increase its windbreaking height. A rich flora develops over the lifespan of a Cornish hedge. The Cornish hedge contributes to the distinctive field-pattern of the Cornish landscape and its semi-natural wildlife habitat. There are about of hedges in Cornwall today.

Hedges suffer from the effects of tree roots, burrowing rabbits, rain, wind, farm animals and people. How often repairs are needed depends on how well the hedge was built, its stone, and what has happened to it since it was last repaired. Typically a hedge needs a cycle of repair every 150 years or so, or less often if it is fenced. Building new hedges, and repairing existing hedges, is a skilled craft, and there are professional hedgers in Cornwall. The Cornish Hedge Research and Education Group (CHREG) supports the development of traditional skills and works with Cornwall Council, FWAG (Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group), Stone Academy Bodmin, Cornwall AONB, Country Trust and professional hedgers to ensure the future of Cornish Hedges in the landscape.

==In gardening==
Hedges, both clipped and unclipped, are often used as ornament in the layout of gardens. Typical woody plants for clipped hedges include privet, hawthorn, beech, yew, leyland cypress, hemlock, arborvitae, barberry, box, holly, oleander, lavender, among others. An early 20th-century fashion was for tapestry hedges, using a mix of golden, green and glaucous dwarf conifers, or beech and copper beech. Unclipped hedges take up more space, generally at a premium in modern gardens, but compensate by flowering. &quot;Rosa multiflora&quot; is widely used as a dense hedge along the central reservation of dual-carriageway roads, such as parkways in the United States. In mild climates, more exotic flowering hedges are formed, using &quot;Ceanothus&quot;, &quot;Hibiscus&quot;, &quot;Camellia&quot;, orange jessamine (&quot;Murraya paniculata&quot;), or lillypilly (&quot;Syzygium&quot; species). 
It is also possible to prepare really nice and dense hedge from other deciduous plants, however they do not have decorative flowers as the bushes mentioned before. 

Hedges of clipped trees forming avenues are a feature of 16th-century Italian gardens such as the Boboli Gardens in Florence, and of formal French gardens in the manner of André Le Nôtre, e.g. in the Gardens of Versailles, where they surround bosquets or areas formalized woodland. The English version of this was the wilderness, normal in large gardens until the English landscape garden style and the rise of the shrubbery began to sweep them away from about 1750. The &#x27;hedge on stilts&#x27; of clipped hornbeams at Hidcote Manor Garden, Gloucestershire, is famous and has sometimes been imitated; it is fact a standard French and Italian style of the bosquet.

Hedges below knee height are generally thought of as borders. Elaborately shaped and interlaced borders forming knot gardens or parterres were fashionable in Europe during the 16th and early 17th centuries. Generally they were appreciated from a raised position, either the windows of a house, or a terrace.

Clipped hedges above eye level may be laid out in the form of a labyrinth or garden maze. Few such mazes survived the change of fashion towards more naturalistic plantings in the 18th and 19th centuries, but many were replanted in 20th-century restorations of older gardens. An example is behind the Governor&#x27;s Palace, Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia.
Hedges and pruning can both be used to enhance a garden&#x27;s privacy, as a buffer to visual pollution and to hide fences. A hedge can be aesthetically pleasing, as in a tapestry hedge, where alternate species are planted at regular intervals to present different colours or textures.

In America, fences have always been more common than hedges to mark garden boundaries. The English radical William Cobbett was already complaining about this in 1819:

And why should America not possess this most beautiful and useful plant [the Haw-Thorn]? She has English gew-gaws, English Play-Actors, English Cards and English Dice and Billiards; English fooleries and English vices enough in all conscience; and why not English Hedges, instead of post-and-rail and board fences? If, instead of these steril-looking and cheerless enclosures the gardens and meadows and fields, in the neighbourhood of New York and other cities and towns, were divided by quick-set hedges, what a difference would the alteration make in the look, and in the real value too, of those gardens, meadows and fields!

== Regulation ==
In the US, some local jurisdictions may strictly regulate the placement or height of a hedge, such as the case where a Palo Alto city resident was arrested for allowing her xylosma hedge to grow above two feet.

In the UK the owner of a large hedge that is adversely affecting the reasonable enjoyment of neighbouring domestic property can be made to reduce it in height. In England and Wales, high hedges are covered under Part 8 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003. For a hedge to qualify for reduction, it must be made up wholly or mainly of a line of two or more evergreen or semi-evergreen trees or shrubs and be over 2 metres high. To some degree, it must be a barrier to light or access. It must be adversely affecting the complainant&#x27;s reasonable enjoyment of their domestic property (either their house or garden) because of its height. Later legislation with similar effect was introduced in Northern Ireland, Isle of Man and Scotland.

==Significant hedges==
The 19th-century Great Hedge of India was probably the largest example of a hedge used as a barrier. It was planted and used to collect taxes by the British.

The Willow Palisade, constructed during the early Qing dynasty (17th century) to control people&#x27;s movement and to collect taxes on ginseng and timber in southern Manchuria, also had hedge-like features. The palisade included two dikes and a moat between them, the dikes topped by rows of willow trees, tied to one another with their branches.
Gradually decaying throughout the late 18th and 19th centuries, the palisade disappeared in the early 20th century, its remaining willows cut during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905 by the two countries&#x27; soldiers.

The Meikleour Beech Hedges, located near Meikleour in Scotland, are noted in the Guinness World Records as the tallest and longest hedge on earth, reaching in height and in length. The beech trees were planted in 1745 by Jean Mercer on the Marquess of Lansdowne&#x27;s Meikleour estate.

The hedgerows and sunken lanes in Normandy, France posed a problem to Allied tanks after Operation Overlord, the invasion of Europe, in World War 2. The hedgerows prevented the tanks from freely moving about the area, until they were fitted with tusks.

<doc id="339562" wikidata="Q740662" url="?curid=339562" title="Camera lucida">
<text>A camera lucida is an optical device used as a drawing aid by artists and microscopists. It projects an optical superimposition of the subject being viewed onto the surface upon which the artist is drawing. The artist sees both scene and drawing surface simultaneously, as in a photographic double exposure. This allows the artist to duplicate key points of the scene on the drawing surface, thus aiding in the accurate rendering of perspective.

==History==

The &quot;camera lucida&quot; was patented in 1806 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston.
The basic optics were described 200 years earlier by the German astronomer Johannes Kepler in his &quot;Dioptrice&quot; (1611), but there is no evidence he constructed a working &quot;camera lucida&quot;. There is also evidence to suggest that the Elizabethan spy Arthur Gregory&#x27;s 1596 &quot;perspective box&quot; operated on at least highly similar principles to the later &quot;camera lucida&quot;, but the secretive nature of his work and fear of rivals copying his methods led to his invention becoming lost. By the 19th century, Kepler&#x27;s description had similarly fallen into oblivion, so Wollaston&#x27;s claim to have invented the device was never challenged. The term &quot;&quot; (Latin &#x27;well-lit room&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;dark room&#x27;) is Wollaston&#x27;s.

While on honeymoon in Italy in 1833, the photographic pioneer William Fox Talbot used a &quot;camera lucida&quot; as a sketching aid. He later wrote that it was a disappointment with his resulting efforts which encouraged him to seek a means to &quot;cause these natural images to imprint themselves durably&quot;.

In 2001, artist David Hockney&#x27;s book &quot;Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters&quot; was met with controversy. His argument, known as the Hockney-Falco thesis, is that the notable transition in style for greater precision and visual realism that occurred around the decade of the 1420s is attributable to the artists&#x27; discovery of the capability of optical projection devices, specifically an arrangement using a concave mirror to project real images. Their evidence is based largely on the characteristics of the paintings by great artists of later centuries, such as Ingres, Van Eyck, and Caravaggio.

The &quot;camera lucida&quot; is still available today through art-supply channels but is not well known or widely used. It has enjoyed a resurgence as of 2017 through a number of Kickstarter campaigns.

==Description==

The name &quot;&quot; (Latin for &#x27;light chamber&#x27;) is intended to recall the much older drawing aid, the (Latin for &#x27;dark chamber&#x27;). There is no optical similarity between the devices. The &quot;camera lucida&quot; is a lightweight, portable device that does not require special lighting conditions. No image is projected by the &quot;camera lucida&quot;.

In the simplest form of &quot;camera lucida&quot;, the artist looks down at the drawing surface through a glass pane or half-silvered mirror tilted at 45 degrees. This superimposes a direct view of the drawing surface beneath, and a reflected view of a scene horizontally in front of the artist. This design produces an inverted image which is right-left reversed when turned the right way up. Also, light is lost in the imperfect reflection.

Wollaston&#x27;s design used a prism with four optical faces to produce two successive reflections (see illustration), thus producing an image that is not inverted or reversed. Angles ABC and ADC are 67.5° and BCD is 135°. Hence, the reflections occur through total internal reflection, so very little light is lost. It is not possible to see straight through the prism, so it is necessary to look at the very edge to see the paper.

The instrument often came with an assortment of weak negative lenses, to create a virtual image of the scene at several distances. If the right lens is inserted, so that the chosen distance roughly equals the distance of the drawing surface, both images can be viewed in good focus simultaneously.

If white paper is used with the &quot;camera lucida&quot;, the superimposition of the paper with the scene tends to wash out the scene, making it difficult to view. When working with a &quot;camera lucida&quot;, it is often beneficial to use toned or grey paper. Some historical designs included shaded filters to help balance lighting. 

==Microscopy==
As recently as the 1980s, the &quot;camera lucida&quot; was still a standard tool of microscopists. It is still a key tool in the field of palaeontology. Until very recently, photomicrographs were expensive to reproduce. Furthermore, in many cases, a clear illustration of the structure that the microscopist wished to document was much easier to produce by drawing than by micrography. Thus, most routine histological and microanatomical illustrations in textbooks and research papers were &quot;camera lucida&quot; drawings rather than photomicrographs. The &quot;camera lucida&quot; is still used as the most common method among neurobiologists for drawing brain structures, although it is recognised to have limitations. &quot;For decades in cellular neuroscience, camera lucida hand drawings have constituted essential illustrations. (...) The limitations of camera lucida can be avoided by the procedure of digital reconstruction&quot;. Of particular concern is distortion, and new digital methods are being introduced which can limit or remove this, &quot;computerized techniques result in far fewer errors in data transcription and analysis than the camera lucida procedure&quot;. It is also regularly used in biological taxonomy.

<doc id="339566" wikidata="Q820211" url="?curid=339566" title="Massacre of Verden">
<text>The Massacre of Verden was an event during the Saxon Wars where the Frankish king Charlemagne ordered the death of 4,500 Saxons in October 782. Charlemagne claimed suzerainty over Saxony and in 772 destroyed the Irminsul, an important object in Saxon paganism, during his intermittent thirty-year campaign to Christianize the Saxons. The massacre occurred in Verden in what is now Lower Saxony, Germany. The event is attested in contemporary Frankish sources, including the &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot;.

Beginning in the 1870s, some scholars have attempted to exonerate Charlemagne of the massacre by way of a proposed manuscript error but these attempts have since been generally rejected. While the figure of 4,500 victims has generally been accepted, some scholars regard it as an exaggeration.

==Sources==
An entry for the year 782 in the first version of the &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot; (&quot;Annales Regni Francorum&quot;) records a Saxon rebellion, followed by a Saxon victory in the battle of Süntel before Charlemagne arrived and put down the rebellion. Charlemagne ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxons near the confluence of the Aller and the Weser, in what is now Verden. Regarding the massacre, the entry reads:

:When he heard this, the Lord King Charles rushed to the place with all the Franks that he could gather on short notice and advanced to where the Aller flows into the Weser. Then all the Saxons came together again, submitted to the authority of the Lord King, and surrendered the evildoers who were chiefly responsible for this revolt to be put to death—four thousand and five hundred of them. This sentence was carried out. Widukind was not among them since he had fled to &quot;Nordmannia&quot; [Denmark]. When he had finished this business, the Lord King returned to Francia.
The &quot;Annales qui dicuntur Einhardi&quot; (Annals of Einhard), which are a revised version of the &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot; and not a completely independent source, give a different account of the battle of the Süntel, recording that Charlemagne lost two envoys, four counts, and around twenty nobles in a Frankish defeat. The reviser agrees about the punishment meted out on the Saxon rebels, and adds some details, such as that the Saxons blamed Widukind, that the number 4,500 was a minimum and that the executions took place in a single day:

A short notice under the same year in the &quot;Annales Laubacenses&quot; (Annals of Lobbes) and the related &quot;Annales sancti Amandi&quot; (Annals of Saint-Amand) reads: &quot;The rebellious Saxons killed many Franks; and Charles, [having] gathered the Saxons together, ordered them beheaded&quot; (&quot;Saxones rebellantes plurimos Francos interfecerunt; et Karlus, congregatos Saxones, iussit eos decollare&quot;). For the year 782, the &quot;Annales Sangallenses Baluzii&quot; are more cryptic: &quot;this year the Lord King Charles killed many Saxons&quot; (&quot;hoc anno domnus rex Karolus plures de Saxonis interfecit&quot;).

==Scholarship==
Historian Alessandro Barbero says that, regarding Charlemagne, the massacre &quot;produced perhaps the greatest stain on his reputation&quot;. In his survey on scholarship regarding Charlemagne, Barbero comments on attempts at exonerating Charlemagne and his forces from the massacre:

Several historians have attempted to lessen Charles&#x27;s responsibility for the massacre, by stressing that until a few months earlier the king thought he had pacified the country, the Saxon nobles had sworn allegiance, and many of them had been appointed counts. Thus the rebellion constituted an act of treason punishable by death, the same penalty that the extremely harsh Saxon law imposed with great facility, even for the most insignificant of crimes. Others have attempted to twist the accounts provided by sources, arguing that the Saxons were killed in battle and not massacred in cold blood, or even that the verb &quot;decollare&quot; (to decapitate) was a copyist&#x27;s error in place of &quot;delocare&quot; (to relocate), so the prisoners were deported. None of these attempts has proved credible.

He continues: &quot;the most likely inspiration for the mass execution of Verden was the Bible&quot;, Charlemagne desiring &quot;to act like a true King of Israel&quot;, citing the biblical tale of the total extermination of the Amalekites and the conquest of the Moabites by David. Barbero further points out that a few years later, a royal chronicler, commenting on Charlemagne&#x27;s treatment of the Saxons, records that &quot;either they were defeated or subjected to the Christian religion or completely swept away.&quot;

Roger Collins identifies the victims of the massacre as all Saxons held to have participated in the battle of the Süntel. Charlemagne may have found his precedent for mass execution in the Council of Cannstatt of 745/6, whereat his uncle Carloman executed numerous leading Alemannic noblemen.

The German historian Martin Lintzel argued that the figure of 4,500 was an exaggeration, partly based on the theory of Hans Delbrück regarding the small size of early medieval armies. On the other hand, Bernard Bachrach argues that the 4,500 captured warriors were but a small fraction of the able-bodied men in the region. The annalist&#x27;s figure of 4,500, he notes, is generally accepted by scholars. He puts it at less than the entire Saxon army that fought at the Süntel, and suggests that Widukind&#x27;s personal retinue probably also escaped capture.

The medievalist Henry Mayr-Harting argues that since &quot;reputation was of the highest importance to the warrior element of a heroic-age society&quot; the massacre of Verden, whatever its actual scope, would have backfired on Charlemagne:

On the reputational side during Charlemagne&#x27;s wars, the Saxons&#x27; greatest &quot;gain&quot; will undoubtedly have been the blood bath of Verden in 783 [&quot;sic&quot;]. If but one tenth of the 4500 warriors said to have been slaughtered actually fell under the Frankish swords, think what a series of laments for fallen warriors, what a &quot;Gododdin&quot;, what a subsequent celebration of reputation by poets, that would have made possible!

He further argues that the Saxons were probably unable to mount another serious revolt for several years after Verden, since they had to wait for a new generation of young men to reach fighting age.

Matthias Becher, in his biography of Charlemagne, suggests that a much smaller number of executions accompanied deportations in the year 782. Carole Cusack interprets the method of execution as hanging rather than beheading.

The &quot;Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae&quot;, a law code promulgated by Charlemagne, has traditionally been dated to 782–85, in response to Widukind&#x27;s rebellion. More recently, Yitzhak Hen has suggested a later date (c. 795), based on the influence of Islamic theology of &quot;jihad&quot; through the Spaniard Theodulf of Orléans. This theory has not found wide acceptance.

Janet L. Nelson calls the massacre &quot;exemplary legal vengeance for the deaths of [Charlemagne&#x27;s ministers] and their men in the Süntel Hills&quot;. According to her, even if the Frankish leaders at the Süntel were at fault for the disaster, as the &quot;Annales qui dicuntur Einhardi&quot; imply, Charlemagne as their lord, according to the standards of the time, owed them vengeance. Nelson says that the method of mass execution—&quot;decollatio&quot;, beheading—was also chosen for its symbolic value, for it was the Roman penalty for traitors and oath-breakers.

==Legacy==
The massacre became particularly significant and controversial among German nationalists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and in Nazi Germany. In 1935, landscape architect Wilhelm Hübotter designed a memorial, known as the Sachsenhain (&quot;Saxon Grove&quot;), that was built at a possible site of the massacre. This site functioned for a period as a meeting place for the Schutzstaffel. Popular discussion of the massacre made Charlemagne a controversial figure in Nazi Germany until his official &quot;rehabilitation&quot; by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels, after which Charlemagne was officially presented in a positive manner in Nazi Germany.

===Assessments before 1933===

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, historians generally approved of the executions of Verden, as displays of piety. During the Enlightenment this changed. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was one of the first to suggest that Verden cast a shadow over Charlemagne&#x27;s legacy. Voltaire considered the king a &quot;thousandfold murderer&quot;, with Verden the centrepiece of his barbarism.

According to Barbero, the incident would be little more than a footnote in scholarship were it not for controversy in German circles due to nationalistic sentiment before and during the Nazi era in Germany. The controversy over the massacre was linked to disputes among German nationalists about the image of Charlemagne. Some Germans saw the victims of the massacre as defenders of Germany&#x27;s traditional beliefs, resisting the foreign religion of Christianity. Wilhelm Teudt mentions the site of the massacre in his 1929 book &quot;Germanische Heiligtümer&quot; (&#x27;Germanic Shrines&#x27;). Some Christian nationalists linked Charlemagne with the humiliation of French domination after World War I, especially the occupation of the Rhineland. Of the first generation of German historians after 1871 to defend Charlemagne, Louis Halphen considered their efforts a failure.

=== Nazi Germany ===
Hermann Gauch, Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s adjutant for culture, took the view that Charlemagneknown in German as Karl the Great ()should be officially renamed &quot;Karl the Slaughterer&quot; because of the massacre. He advocated a memorial to the victims. Alfred Rosenberg also stated that the Saxon leader Widukind, not Karl, should be called &quot;the Great&quot;. In Nazi Germany, the massacre became a major topic of debate. In 1934, two plays about Widukind were performed. The first, &quot;Der Sieger&quot; (&quot;The Victor&quot;) by Friedrich Forster, portrayed Charlemagne as brutal but his goal, Christianization of the pagan Saxons, as necessary. Reception was mixed. The second, &quot;Wittekind&quot;, by Edmund Kiß, was more controversial for its criticism of Christianity. The play resulted in serious disturbances and was stopped after just two performances. Described by one historian as &quot;little more than an extended anti-Catholic rant&quot;, the plot depicted Charlemagne as a murderous tyrant and Verden as &quot;attempted genocide plotted by the Church.&quot;

In 1935, landscape architect Wilhelm Hübotter was commissioned to build the &quot;Sachsenhain&quot; (German &#x27;Grove of the Saxons&#x27;) in Verden, a monument commemorating the massacre consisting of 4,500 large stones. The monument was used as both a memorial to the event and as a meeting place for the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot;. The memorial was inscribed to &quot;Baptism-Resistant Germans Massacred by Karl, the Slaughterer of the Saxons&quot;. In the same year the annual celebration of Charlemagne in Aachen, where he is buried, was cancelled and replaced by a lecture on &quot;Karl the Great, Saxon Butcher.&quot; The attacks on Charlemagne as &quot;Sachsenschlächter&quot; (slaughterer of the Saxons) and a tool of the Church and the Papacy were led by Alfred Rosenberg. In 1935, seven professional historians fought back with the volume &quot;Karl der Große oder Charlemagne?&quot; The issue was settled by Adolf Hitler himself, who privately pressured Rosenberg to cease his public condemnations, and by propagandist Joseph Goebbels, who began to issue positive statements about Charlemagne. In 1936, the Nazi historian Heinrich Dannenbauer could refer to Charlemagne&#x27;s &quot;rehabilitation&quot;. A memorial site, &quot;Widukindgedächtnisstätte&quot;, was inaugurated at Engen in 1939.

In 1942, the Nazi regime celebrated the 1200th anniversary of Charlemagne&#x27;s birth. The historian Ahasver von Brandt referred to it as the &quot;official rehabilitation&quot; (&quot;amtliche Rehabilitierung&quot;), although Goebbels acknowledged in private that many people were confused by the about-face of National Socialism. A &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; report of 9 April 1942 noted that:

There were many voices to be heard saying that only a few years ago one had counted as an unreliable National Socialist had one left Karl der Große with so much as a single unblemished feature and not spoken also in tones of loathing of the &quot;slaughterer of Saxons&quot; and &quot;pope&#x27;s and bishops&#x27; lacky&quot;. Many people pose the question as to who in the Party it had been back then who had authorised this derogatory slogan, and from what quarter this completely different evaluation was coming now.

Goebbels&#x27;s opinion was that it was best for state propaganda on historical matters to align with popular opinion, and thus with and not against Charlemagne.

As an example of Charlemagne&#x27;s post-1935 rehabilitation in Nazi Germany, in 1944 the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS &quot;Charlemagne&quot;, a body of French volunteers, was named after the &quot;pan-European Germanic hero&quot; instead of after Joan of Arc.

<doc id="339568" wikidata="Q6446737" url="?curid=339568" title="Kurt Freund">
<text>Kurt Freund (17 January 1914 – 23 October 1996) was a Czech-Canadian physician and sexologist best known for developing the penile plethysmograph (a measurement of sexual arousal in males), research studies in pedophilia, and for the &quot;courtship disorder&quot; hypothesis as a taxonomy of certain paraphilias (voyeurism, exhibitionism, toucherism, frotteurism, and what he called &quot;preferential rape&quot;). After unsuccessful attempts to change men&#x27;s sexual orientation, he advocated against conversion therapy and in favor of the decriminalization of homosexuality.

==Early life==
Freund was born into a German-speaking Jewish family in Chrudim, then part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, later Czechoslovakia, now in the Czech Republic. He married Anna Hlounová, a non-Jewish Czech pianist and music teacher, on 13 January 1942. In 1943, they divorced in order to protect Anna and their newborn daughter Helen from anti-Jewish and anti-miscegenation legislation implemented by the German Nazi Occupiers. They remarried after the war in 1945, and Anna gave birth to a son, Peter, in 1948. Many of Freund&#x27;s relatives were murdered in the Holocaust, including his parents Heinrich and Hella, and his brother Hans.

==Research ==
In 1948, Freund joined the Department of Psychiatry at Charles University in Prague. Freund received his M.D. at Charles University of Prague, and later a D.Sc. degree there in 1962. He carried out post-doctoral research and later both research and clinical work at Charles University&#x27;s Sexological Institute. Freund fled to Canada in 1968, in the wake of the Prague Spring. Freund then began plethysmography studies of male sexual orientation at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (then called the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry) in Toronto, where much of the research and published data using PPG originated. The Kurt Freund Laboratory at that centre is named after him. 

===Homosexuality===
Between 1950 and 1953, Freund treated 67 men for homosexual tendencies. Some of his patients voluntarily sought to change their sexual orientation, while others received remission of prosecution or legal penalties so that they could undergo the experiment. Taking a behaviorist perspective, he attempted to reinforce heterosexual feelings while punishing homosexual ones in order to change sexual orientation. Patients were given nausea-inducing drugs while exposed to images of other men, then given testosterone injections and exposed to photographs of naked women. Freund followed up with his patients in 1956 and 1958, concluding that the experiment was not a success. His empirical data showed some of the first evidence that sexual orientation conversion therapy was generally futile. He demonstrated that even homosexually oriented men who appeared to have given up sexual relations with other men and established heterosexual marriages were still aroused by images of men rather than women. Freund also challenged contemporary psychoanalytic theories of male homosexuality that suggested it was due to a fear or aversion to women.

In 1957, he began to advocate for the decriminalization of homosexuality, which happened in Czechoslovakia in 1961 following an official recommendation signed by Freund and other psychiatrists. Like other researchers at the time, however, he continued to see homosexuality as a pathology. In 1977, he apologized for his attempt to change sexual orientation, writing that if his experiment &quot;has &#x27;helped&#x27; at all, has helped clients to enter into marriages that later became unbearable or almost unbearable&quot; and expressing doubt that homosexuality should be considered an illness because of the chance that &quot;reasonable social changes may virtually abolish all specific distress of homosexual persons&quot;. Freund advised his patients to make peace with their sexual orientation.

===Penile plethysmography===
Around 1953, Freund began to develop a device for penile plethysmography to measure blood flow to the penis, building off of earlier attempts to create such a device. He was initially commissioned to detect recruits attempting to evade military service by falsely claiming to be homosexual. Over his career, he refined the penile plethysmograph as part of a broad program of research on male sexual interest. Sex offenders could sometimes suppress arousal through concentration or surreptitiously causing themselves pain, similar to methods for producing false results on a polygraph (lie detector). During one experiment, he found that 17% of heterosexuals or homosexuals were able to pretend to be the other sexual orientation during the test. Although he recognized its limitations, Freund continued to advocate for the use of the device to measure male sexual arousal, not only sexual orientation but also pedophilia. During the 1960s, he published several papers informing other researchers to recreate and use the device.

There was controversy regarding potential abuses of devices to measure sexual interests, following fears that it might lead to discrimination against gay men. Phallometric testing has been shown, however, to be one of the most accurate, if not the single most accurate, methods of identifying the sexual offenders that are most likely to commit new sexual offenses against children. On the other hand, another study concluded that &quot;although the validity of the technique for research and clinical assessment is now established, justification for the routine use of the technique must await a proper standardization of the technique and the publication of reliable norms.&quot;

===Paraphilias and sex offenders===

Initially focused on homosexuality, Freund later expanded his study to pedophilia, rape, transsexuality, and paraphilia. He developed the theory of courtship disorder, explaining paraphilias such as exhibitionism, voyeurism, telephone scatologia, frotteurism, and biastophilia (a preference for rape) as disorders of the normal courtship process. He focused on detection and diagnosis of sex offenders, particularly preference pedophiles, with a view to more appropriate treatment guidelines.

==Death==
Freund was diagnosed with cancer in 1994 and was a member of Dying with Dignity. When his health deteriorated in 1996, he took a lethal cocktail of muscle relaxants, sleeping pills and wine. Freund was cremated, and his ashes were scattered on the lawn across from his office at the Clarke Institute in Toronto and on the grounds of Psychiatric Hospital Bohnice in Prague, where he had worked for many years in Czechoslovakia.

<text>Sergei Kopeikin (born April 10, 1956) is a USSR-born theoretical physicist and astronomer presently living and working in the United States, where he holds the position of Professor of Physics at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. He specializes in the theoretical and experimental study of gravity and general relativity. He is also an expert in the field of the astronomical reference frames and time metrology. His general relativistic theory of the Post-Newtonian reference frames which he had worked out along with Victor A. Brumberg, was adopted in 2000 by the resolutions of the International Astronomical Union as a standard for reduction of ground-based astronomical observation. 
A computer program Tempo2 used to analyze radio observations of pulsars, includes several effects predicted by S. Kopeikin that are important for measuring parameters of the binary pulsars,
for testing general relativity, and for detection of gravitational waves of ultra-low frequency. Sergei Kopeikin has worked out a complete post-Newtonian theory of equations of motion of N extended bodies in scalar-tensor theory of gravity with all mass and spin multipole moments of arbitrary order and derived the Lagrangian of the relativistic N-body problem. 
In September 2002, S. Kopeikin led a team which conducted a high-precision VLBI experiment to measure the fundamental speed of gravity, thus, confirming the Einstein&#x27;s prediction on the relativistic nature of gravitational field and its finite speed of propagation.

He is also involved in studies concerning the capabilities of the Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) technique to measure dynamical features of the General Theory of Relativity in the lunar motion. He has critically analyzed the claims of other scientists concerning the possibility of LLR to measure the gravitomagnetic interaction. Prof. Kopeikin organized and chaired three international workshops on the advanced theory and model of the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment. The LLR workshops were held in the International Space Science Institute (Bern, Switzerland) in 2010-2012.

Recently, S. Kopeikin has been actively involved in theoretical studies on relativistic geodesy and applications of atomic clocks for high-precision navigation and in geodetic datum. He has provided an exact relativistic definition of geoid, and worked out the post-Newtonian concepts of the Maclaurin spheroid and normal gravity formula. 
S. Kopeikin&#x27;s workshop on spacetime metrology, clocks and relativistic geodesy is held in the International Space Science Institute (Bern, Switzerland).

Kopeikin was born in Kashin, a small town near Moscow in what was then the USSR. He graduated with excellence from Department of Astrophysics of Moscow State University in 1983 where he studied general relativity under Leonid Grishchuk. In 1986, he obtained a Ph.D. in relativistic astrophysics from the Space Research Institute in Moscow. His Ph.D. thesis was advised by Yakov Borisovich Zel&#x27;dovich and presented a first general-relativistic derivation of the conservative and radiation reaction forces in the Post-Newtonian expansion of the gravitational field of a binary system of two extended, massive bodies. 
In 1991, he obtained a Doctor of Science degree in Physics and Mathematics from Moscow State University and moved to Tokyo (Japan) in 1993 to teach astronomy in Hitotsubashi University. He was adjunct staff member in National Astronomical Observatory of Japan in 1993-1996 and a visiting professor in the same observatory in 1996-1997. Kopeikin moved to Germany in 1997 and worked in the Institute for Theoretical Physics of Friedrich Schiller University of Jena and in Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy until 1999. He had joined Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Missouri in February 2000 where he got tenure in 2004.

He has been married to Zoia Kopeikina (daughter of Solomon Borisovich Pikelner) since 1980, they have four daughters, four granddaughters and three grandsons. As of December 2019 the family lives in Columbia, Missouri and Texas.

== Bibliometric information ==

Prof. Kopeikin has published 198 scientific papers and 2 books. He was an editor of two other books on advances in relativistic celestial mechanics. According to Google Scholar Citations program, the h-index of S.M. Kopeikin is 41, his i10-index is 97, while the total number of citations is 5741.
As of August 2024, NASA ADS returns for him an h-index of 33, while his tori and riq indices are 53.7 and 174, respectively.

<text>The Agora of the Competaliasts () is an ancient Greek archaeological site on the island of Delos, Greece, which dates to the last quarter of the 2nd century BC. It is an agora (public space and commercial center) directly adjacent to the Sacred Harbour. The bases of a square and a round marble monument, both dedicated to Hermes, can be found in the center of the market square. Around these two monuments, one can see the remains of many other monuments erected by merchants, sea captains, and bankers. In the northern portion of this market, one can find the Portico of Philip and an Ionic temple dedicated to Hermes. In the eastern and southern portions are the remains of shops from the golden days of this Hellenic commerce center. The ground is paved with stones of gneiss and there are holes in the stones where tent poles would have gone.

<text>Caerphilly (, ; , ) is a town and community in Wales. It is situated at the southern end of the Rhymney Valley and separated from the Cardiff suburbs of Lisvane and Rhiwbina by Caerphilly Mountain.

It is north of Cardiff and west of Newport. It is the largest town in Caerphilly County Borough and lies within the historic borders of Glamorgan, on the border with Monmouthshire. At the 2011 Census, the town had a population of 41,402 while the wider Caerphilly local authority area had a population of 178,806.

==Toponym==
The name of the town in Welsh, , means &quot;the fort () of Ffili&quot;. Despite lack of evidence, tradition states that a monastery was built by St Cenydd, a sixth-century Christian hermit from the Gower Peninsula, in the area. The Welsh cantref in the medieval period was known as Senghenydd. It is said that St Cenydd&#x27;s son, St Ffili, built a fort in the area, giving the town its name. An alternative explanation is that the town was named after the Anglo-Norman Marcher Lord, Philip de Braose.

== History ==
The town&#x27;s site has long been of strategic significance. Around AD 75 a fort was built by the Romans during their conquest of Britain. An excavation of the site in 1963 showed that the fort was occupied by Roman forces until the middle of the second century.

Following the Norman invasion of Wales in the late 11th century, the area of Sengenhydd remained in Welsh hands. By the middle of the 12th century, the area was under the control of the Welsh chieftain Ifor Bach (Ifor ap Meurig). His grandson Gruffydd ap Rhys was the final Welsh lord of Sengenhydd, which fell to the English nobleman Gilbert de Clare, the Red Earl, in 1266. In 1267 Henry III was forced to recognise Llywelyn ap Gruffudd as Prince of Wales, and by September 1268 Llywelyn had secured northern Sengenhydd. Gilbert de Clare had already begun to take steps to consolidate his own territorial gains, beginning the construction of Caerphilly Castle on 11 April 1268. The castle would also act as a buffer against Llewelyn&#x27;s own territorial ambitions and was attacked by the Prince of Wales&#x27; forces before construction was halted in 1270. Construction recommenced in 1271 and was continued under the Red Earl&#x27;s son, Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester. With only interior remodelling carried out to the castle by Hugh le Despenser in the 1320s, Caerphilly Castle remains a pure example of 13th-century military architecture and is the largest castle in Wales, and the second largest in Britain (after Windsor).
The original town of Caerphilly grew up as a small settlement established just south of the castle by Gilbert de Clare. After the death of de Clare at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314, Edward II became guardian of de Clare&#x27;s three sisters and heiresses. In 1315 he replaced de Badlesmere with a new English administrator, Payn de Turberville of Coity, who persecuted the people of Glamorgan. Then, like many in northern Europe at the time, the region was in the throes of a serious famine. In coming to the defence of his people, Llywelyn Bren, the great-grandson of Ifor Bach and Welsh Lord of Senghenydd, incurred the wrath of de Turberville, who charged him with sedition. Llywelyn appealed to Edward II to call off or control his self-interested agent, but Edward ordered Llywelyn to appear before Parliament to face the charge of treason. The King promised Llywelyn that if the charges were found true, he would be hanged. Llywelyn fled and prepared for war. On 28 January 1316, Llywelyn began the revolt with a surprise attack on Caerphilly Castle. He captured the constable outside the castle and the outer ward, but could not break into the inner defences. His forces burned the town, slaughtered some of its inhabitants and started a siege. The town was rebuilt but remained very small throughout the Middle Ages. The first evidence of its emerging importance was the construction of a court house in the 14th century, the only pre-19th-century building, apart from the castle, that remains in the town.

At the beginning of the 15th century the castle was again attacked, this time by Owain Glyndŵr, who took control of it around 1403–5. Repairs to the castle continued until at least 1430, but just a century later the antiquary John Leland recorded that the castle was a ruin set in marshland, with a single tower being used as a prison. In the mid-16th century the 2nd Earl of Pembroke used the castle as a manorial court, but in 1583 the castle was leased to Thomas Lewis, who accelerated its dilapidation by removing stonework to build his nearby manor, the Van. The Lewis family, who claimed descent from Ifor Bach, left the manor in the mid-18th century when they purchased St Fagans Castle, the Van falling into decay.

During the 1700s, Caerphilly began to grow into a market town, and in the 19th century, as the South Wales Valleys underwent massive growth through industrialisation, the town&#x27;s population grew. Caerphilly railway station was opened in 1871, and in 1899 the Rhymney Railway built its Caerphilly railway works maintenance facilities; however, the expansion of the population in the 19th century was more to do with the increasing market for coal.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Caerphilly: Caerphilly Town Council at community level and Caerphilly County Borough Council at borough level. The town council is based at the Twyn Community Centre. The borough is named after Caerphilly, but covers a much larger area. The county borough council&#x27;s main offices are not in the town of Caerphilly itself, but in the more central location of Ystrad Mynach.

Historically, Caerphilly formed part of the ancient parish of Eglwysilan in the county of Glamorgan. A local board was established to provide local government for Caerphilly in 1893, covering the two parishes of Eglwysilan and Llanfabon. The district covered by the board included a substantial area to the west and north-west of the town itself, extending to Taff&#x27;s Well, Nelson and the southern part of Ystrad Mynach. In 1894, local boards were reconstituted as urban districts.

Caerphilly Urban District Council governed the area from 1894 until 1974. It established its headquarters at a converted house called Bron Rhiw on Mountain Road. The urban district was abolished in 1974, with the majority of the area becoming part of Rhymney Valley District in the new county of Mid Glamorgan, except for the Taff&#x27;s Well ward which went instead to Taff-Ely. A Caerphilly community was established at the same time, being a lower-tier authority, initially covering that part of the former urban district within Rhymney Valley. The community was divided in 1985, with separate communities being created for Aber Valley, Llanbradach, Nelson, and Penyhreol, and transferring the part of Ystrad Mynach which had been in the Caerphilly community to the Gelligaer community. This left the reduced Caerphilly community just covering the town itself. Further local government reorganisation in 1996 saw the abolition of Mid Glamorgan County Council, and Rhymney Valley merged with neighbouring Islwyn borough to become the Caerphilly County Borough.

== Culture ==
Caerphilly is featured in the Sex Pistols documentary &quot;The Filth and the Fury&quot;. Protests and a prayer meeting were held outside the Castle Cinema on the evening of 14 December 1976, when the group were playing a concert there. However, Caerphilly was one of the few councils that would allow the group to perform (Leeds and Manchester being the others). Caerphilly Castle was used as a filming location for Merlin and the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes &quot;The Rebel Flesh&quot; and &quot;The Almost People&quot; (2011).

Caerphilly hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1950.

There are a number of notable figures who grew up in Caerphilly. They include comedian Tommy Cooper and the footballers David Pipe, Aaron Ramsey and Robert Earnshaw, whose family relocated to the town from Zambia.

The town has a rugby union club, Caerphilly RFC, who play in League Two East Central of the WRU National League.

Caerphilly also has its own angling club named Caerphilly &amp; District Angling Association which was founded in the late 1940&#x27;s.

The town is known outside Wales for Caerphilly cheese and has hosted two food fairs, the Caerphilly Food Festival, which is held on the streets of the town, and the Big Cheese Festival, which has been held in and around Caerphilly Castle every summer since 1998. Visitor numbers reached 80,000 in 2012. The event includes a wide variety of cheese stalls as well as a funfair, fireworks and a cheese race around the castle.

Caerphilly hosts a fundraising musical event called Megaday. In the Winter there is also the Festival of Light, which involves the procession of hundreds of lanterns through the centre of the town.

In 2012 Caerphilly County&#x27;s only art gallery, Y Galeri, opened in St Fagan&#x27;s Street in the town centre. It was part of plans to build a wider arts centre with exhibitions, workshops and talks.

In 2015, Caerphilly-born writer Thomas Morris published a short story collection, &quot;We Don&#x27;t Know What We&#x27;re Doing&quot;, which is set in Caerphilly. The book won the 2016 Wales Book of the Year and a Somerset Maugham Award.

== Caerphilly Heart Disease Study ==
The Caerphilly Heart Disease Study (also known as the Caerphilly Prospective Study) is one of the world&#x27;s longest running epidemiology studies. Since 1979, a representative sample of adult males born between 1918 and 1938, living in Caerphilly and the surrounding villages of Abertridwr, Bedwas, Machen, Senghenydd and Trethomas, have participated in the study. A wide range of health and lifestyle data have been collected throughout the study and have been the basis for over 400 publications in the medical press. A notable report was on the reductions in vascular disease, diabetes, cognitive impairment and dementia attributable to a healthy lifestyle.

== Transport ==

===Aviation===

The nearest airport is Cardiff Airport which is away by road, it is a 35-minute drive and about an hour by train and shuttle bus.

Bristol Airport is away by road.

===Rail===

Caerphilly has three railway stations. All are located on the Rhymney Line serving Cardiff.

* Caerphilly at the southern end of the town near the shopping area
* Aber in the western part of the town
* Energlyn &amp; Churchill Park railway station in the far western part of the town

The rail service between Caerphilly and Cardiff Queen Street typically takes 13 minutes. From there services continue to Penarth, Cardiff Central, or on occasion Bridgend (Via Rhoose Cardiff International Airport).

===Road===

The A469 trunk road runs through the town north to south and connects the north to the Heads of the Valleys Road and the South to the A48 Gabalfa Interchange. The A468 skirts the northern boundary of the town connecting the west with the A470 and the east with the M4 Motorway European route E30 at junction 28.

===Bus===

Caerphilly has a wide variety of bus services all stopping at Caerphilly Interchange which is integrated with rail services at Caerphilly Railway Station. Services are operated by Stagecoach, Harris Coaches and on Sundays and public holidays by New Adventure Travel.

Almost all services to Cardiff, Newport, Blackwood, Pontypridd, Ystrad Mynach and Bargoed are operated by Stagecoach. There are also many local services to Senghenydd, Bedwas, and Llanbradach. A community bus service called Connect2 is also operated by Caerphilly Council which serves Mornigton Meadows, Bryncenydd and Glenfeilds Estate.

====Traditional buses====

Caerphilly Urban District Council (UDC) had its own fleet of buses, which began operating in 1920 although powers to operate them had been obtained by the UDC in 1917. In 1974, this fleet was amalgamated with those of Bedwas and Machen UDC and of Gelligaer UDC to create the bus fleet of Rhymney Valley District Council. The fleet persists today as a heritage operation.

===Metro===

The South Wales Metro is a system integrating heavy rail, light rail and bus services in South East Wales around the hub of Cardiff Central. The first phase was approved for development in October 2013. Work has already began and the Core Valley lines (including Rhymney line) are to be electrified. New trains will be introduced (British Rail Class 756), Increasing capacity, more frequent services and greener transport for the town and the local region. Caerphilly will also benefit from new greener buses which will also be integrated into the system. The Metro should be completed by late 2023 early 2024.

<text>Chrysophyta or golden algae is a term used to refer to certain heterokonts.

It can be used to refer to:
* Chrysophyceae (golden algae), Bacillariophyceae (diatoms), and Xanthophyceae (yellow-green algae) together. E.g., Pascher (1914).
* Chrysophyceae (golden algae) E.g., Margulis et al. (1990).
Chrysophyta has some characteristics which includes their possession of the photosynthetic pigments which are chlorophylls a and c, they also possess a yellow carotenoid called fucoxanthin, this is responsible for their unique and characteristic color. They also store food as oil and not starch, their cells contain no cellulose and are often impregnated with silicon compounds. Each species has its own special markings.

<doc id="339599" wikidata="Q2347579" url="?curid=339599" title="Confederados">
<text>Confederados () is the Brazilian name for Confederate expatriates, all white Southerners (along with their Black slaves), who fled the Southern United States during Reconstruction, and their Brazilian descendants. They were enticed to Brazil by offers of cheap land from Emperor Dom Pedro II, who had hoped to gain expertise in cotton farming. The regime in Brazil had a number of features that attracted the Confederados, namely the continued legality of slavery, but also political decentralization and a relatively high commitment to free trade. 

It is estimated that up to 20,000 American Confederates immigrated to the Empire of Brazil from the Southern United States after the American Civil War. Initially, most settled in the current state of São Paulo, where they founded the city of Americana, which was once part of the neighboring city of Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste. The descendants of other &quot;Confederados&quot; would later be found throughout Brazil.

The center of Confederado culture is the Campo Cemetery in Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste, where most of the original Confederados from the region were buried. Because of their Protestant religion, they could not be buried in a Catholic cemetery, so they created their own cemetery, the first non-Catholic, non-indigenous cemetery in Brazil. The Confederado community has also established a Museum of Immigration at Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste to present the history of Brazilian immigration and highlight its benefits to the nation.

The descendants still foster a connection with their history through the Fraternity of American Descendants, an organization dedicated to preserving the unique mixed culture. Os Confederados also have an annual festival, called the Festa Confederada, which is used to fund the Campo Cemetery. The festival is marked by Confederate flags, traditional dress of Confederate uniforms and hoop skirts, food of the American South with a Brazilian flair, and dances and music popular in the American South during the Antebellum period.

Although the amount of Confederado descendants living in Brazil today is difficult to estimate, in 2016 they were believed to number in the thousands.

==History==

After the war, many Confederate planters were unwilling to live by the new rules imposed by the Union&#x27;s victory and the constitutional changes that followed: an end to chattel slavery, a new labor regime, and the loss of political power that came with African-American suffrage. Accustomed to raising cotton with the labor of enslaved people, some looked elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere for a place where their old life could be continued.

&quot;Many persons who, from long habit and fondly cherished theories, have become strongly attached to the institution of African slavery, fancy that in Brazil they will find an opportunity for the permanent use of that system of labor — Brazil and the Spanish possessions being the only two slaveholding communities remaining in the civilized world,&quot; the New Orleans &quot;Daily Picayune&quot; wrote in September 1865.

The Brazilian Emperor Dom Pedro II saw an opportunity in the economic disruption in the southern United States and hoped to build up its cotton production for export to the looms of England and France, which had long relied on the Deep South. The Emperor encouraged the immigration of cotton planters from the former Confederacy to enable that expansion.

===Immigration to Brazil===

Even before the end of the war in 1865, there was already talk of immigrating to Brazil, but very little was known about this country. After the war ended, there was such a revival of the issue that several emigration companies were formed. Representatives were sent to Brazil to check the land, climate, and facilities offered by the emperor.

In November 1865, the state of South Carolina formed a colonization society and sent Major Robert Meriwether and Dr. H. A. Shaw, among others, to Brazil to investigate the possibility of establishing a colony. On the way back, they published a report mentioning that two lords had already bought land and settled here. Slaves were cheap, they reported.

A confederate from South Carolina, James McFadden Gaston, traveled extensively in central Brazil. Upon return to the US, Gaston published a book titled &quot;Hunting a Home in Brazil&quot; in 1867. The book was a guide for would-be colonizers and stated in the introduction, &quot;All the requisites of a desirable home have been found in Brazil.&quot;

Many Southerners who accepted the Emperor&#x27;s offer lost their farms and homes during the war, were unwilling to live under occupation by Federal troops during Reconstruction, or simply did not expect an improvement in the Southern economic situation in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, Brazil would not ban slavery until 1888. The Confederates were the first organized Protestant group to settle in Brazil.

===Americana and Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste===

On December 27, 1865, Colonel and Senator William Hutchinson Norris of Alabama landed in the port of Rio de Janeiro. In 1866, William and his son Robert Norris climbed the Serra do Mar, stopped in São Paulo and speculated on land. They were offered land for free in what is now the neighborhood of Brás, but he did not accept it because it was marshy. They were also offered the land where São Caetano do Sul is today, and they refused it for the same reason. They decided to go to Campinas, but at the time, the railroad went only 10 miles beyond São Paulo while Campinas is 35 miles further, so the Norrises bought an ox-cart and headed for Campinas. They took 15 days to reach the city, and there they stayed for a while looking for land, until they cast their sights on the plain that stretched from Campinas to Vila Nova da Constituição, current Piracicaba.

The Norrises bought land from the Domingos da Costa Machado and established themselves on the banks of Ribeirão Quilombo, at the time belonging to the municipality of Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste, today the city of Americana. Upon his arrival, Colonel Norris began to give practical courses in agriculture to farmers in the region, interested in cotton cultivation and new agricultural techniques. The plow he brought from the United States caused so much sensation and curiosity that, within a short time, they had a practical agricultural school, with many students who paid him for the privilege of learning and still cultivating their gardens. The Colonel wrote to his family that he had made US$5,000 from that alone. In mid-1867, the rest of his family arrived, accompanied by many relatives. Many Confederados besides Norris became known for agricultural education and improvement of cotton productivity.
Numerous farms were founded by immigrants from the United States, commemorated today at the Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste Immigration Museum. Cultivation and processing of cotton were significant. They established an intense trade, notably from 1875 onwards, with the arrival of the railroad and the installation of the Santa Barbara Station by the Companhia Paulista de Estradas de Ferro. Due to the constant presence of these immigrants, the village that was formed in the vicinity of the Station became known as &quot;Vila dos Americanos&quot;, or &quot;Vila Americana&quot;, and gave rise to the current city of Americana.

The installation of the Carioba factory by the North American engineer Clement Willmot and Brazilian associates, located one mile from the train station, also dates from this period. Manufacturing played a very important role in the foundation and development of Americana. The education of children was one of the priorities for American families, who set up schools on the properties and hired teachers from the United States. The teaching methods developed by American teachers proved to be so efficient that they were later adopted by Brazilian official education.

Religious services were celebrated on the properties by pastors who moved between various properties and the various centers of the American diaspora. In 1895 the first Presbyterian Church In Brazil? was founded in the village of Estação. Due to the prohibition of burying people of other faiths in the cemeteries of cities administered by the Catholic Church, American immigrants began to bury their dead near the farmhouse. This cemetery became known as the Campo Cemetery, currently a tourist attraction in the city of Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste. Even today the descendants of American families are buried there. It is in this place that descendants gather periodically for religious ceremonies and parties around the 19th-century chapel.

=== Amazonas ===
Jason Williams Stone, a man from Dana, Massachusetts who moved to Brazil before the American Civil War, made a fortune as a tobacco and rubber farmer. Stone&#x27;s plantations, which had more than five thousand hectares, were called Colonia Stone. They were located near the city of Itacoatiara, in Amazonas. Many of his descendants still have the surname &quot;Stone&quot;. They are found mainly in the cities of Manaus and Itacoatiara, in Amazonas.

=== Pará ===
The city of Santarém, in the state of Pará, received a wave of expatriate families from the American Civil War that took place in the South of the United States. The first to land was the Riker family. In the 1970s, David Afton Riker published a book called &quot;The Last Confederate in the Amazon&quot;, which chronicles the saga of this migration and life in the new homeland. The Confederates and their descendants became notable in the business and political life of the region.

It is not known how many Confederado immigrants came to Brazil, but unprecedented research in the records of the port of Rio de Janeiro, by Betty Antunes de Oliveira, shows that around 20,000 U.S. citizens entered Brazil between 1865 and 1885.

==Descendants of Os Confederados==

The first generation of Confederates remained an island community. As is typical, in the third generation, most families had already married native Brazilians or immigrants from other origins. Confederate descendants increasingly began to speak the Portuguese language and identify themselves as Brazilians. As the region around the municipalities of Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste and Americana became a hub for sugarcane production and society became more mobile, the confederates moved to larger cities in search of jobs in urban areas. Currently, only a few families of descendants still live on land owned by their ancestors. The descendants of the confederates are more spread throughout Brazil. They maintain their organization&#x27;s headquarters at the Campo Cemetery, in Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste, where there is also a chapel and a memorial.

Descendants make a connection to their history through the American Descendant Fellowship, a descendant organization dedicated to preserving immigrant culture. The descendants of the confederates also hold an annual festival in Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste called &quot;Festa Confederada&quot;, which is dedicated to funding the Campo Cemetery. During the festival, Confederate flags and uniforms are worn, while Southern American food and dances are served and performed. The descendants maintain affection for the Confederate flag, although they identify themselves as fully Brazilian. Many Confederate descendants traveled to the United States at the invitation of Sons of Confederate Veterans, an organization of American descendants, to visit civil war battlefields, participate in reenactments, or visit the places where their ancestors lived.

The Confederate flag in Brazil did not acquire the same political symbolism as it has in the United States. After then-Governor Jimmy Carter&#x27;s visit to the region in 1972, the government of Americana even incorporated the Confederate flag into its coat of arms (although most of the Italian-descendent population removed it a few years later from the city&#x27;s official symbol, as the descendants of the Confederates now comprise about a tenth of the city&#x27;s population). During his visit to Brazil, Carter also visited the city of Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste and the grave of a great-uncle of his wife, Rosalynn Carter, at Cemitério do Campo. At the time, Carter noted that Confederate descendants sounded and looked exactly like American southerners.

Today, the Campo Cemetery (and the chapel and memorial located within it) in Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste is a memorial, as most of the region&#x27;s original Confederate immigrants were buried there. As Protestants, they were prohibited by the Catholic Church from burying their dead in local cemeteries and had to establish their own cemetery. The community of descendants also contributed to the Museum of Immigration, also located in Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste, to present the history of U.S. immigration to Brazil.

The American immigrants introduced into their new home many new foods, such as pecans, Georgia peanuts and watermelon; new tools such as the iron plow and kerosene lamps; innovations such as modern dentistry, modern agriculture, and the first blood transfusion; and the first non-Catholic churches (Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist). Some foods of the American South also crossed over and became part of general Brazilian culture such as chess pie, vinegar pie, and southern fried chicken. The immigrants also established public schools and provided education to their female children, which was unusual in Brazil at the time.

===Statistics===

;American immigration to Brazil by State up to January (1867)
The Confederate emigres were some 20,000 Southerners, from 12 southern states (e.g. Arkansas, Alabama and Mississippi) who preferred the Brazilian wilderness to life under Union rule after the Civil War.

<doc id="339600" wikidata="Q6794662" url="?curid=339600" title="Max Collins (musician)">
<text>James Maxwell Stuart Collins (born August 28, 1978) is an American musician, singer, and songwriter who is best known as the lead vocalist, primary songwriter, and bassist of the alternative rock band Eve 6 which he co-founded with Jon Siebels. He launched a solo career in 2013 called Marms + The Car Deaths. He has other musical projects including a band called Fitness, and more recently has created a singing Germanic alter-ego called Chevy Mustang.

==Career==
Max Collins (bass, lead vocals), Jon Siebels (guitar, backing vocals), and Nick Meyers (drums) formed the band formed in 1995 in La Crescenta, California first as Yakoo and then Eleventeen; the name Eve 6 was adopted later.[1]

The band issued the self-titled &quot;Eve 6&quot; in 1998, attaining platinum success with hit singles &quot;Inside Out&quot; and &quot;Leech,&quot; the former capturing the #1 spot on the Modern Rock charts and crossing over successfully to pop/Top 40 radio. More widespread recognition came with gold-selling sophomore effort &quot;Horrorscope&quot; (1999), with songs &quot;Promise,&quot; &quot;On the Roof Again&quot;, and Top 40 hit &quot;Here&#x27;s to the Night&quot;.

From mid-2004 until May 2005, Collins performed in a band under the name Brotherhood of Lost Dogs with the drummer from Fountains of Wayne, Brian Young, and bassist Joe &quot;Bass&quot; Howard formerly of The Posies. They played live shows in the Los Angeles area and never released any recorded material. In June 2005 Collins began a new project, The Sugi Tap, with a former band member in Eve 6, Tony Fagenson. In October 2007, The Sugi Tap was put on hold &quot;indefinitely&quot;. The band had released an EP, formerly available at The Sugi Tap&#x27;s website; now only the album art of the EP and a link to Eve 6&#x27;s Myspace page is available.

Collins primarily plays Fender Jazz Basses. As of October 2007, Eve 6 officially said that they are returning minus Jon Siebels, who was replaced by a temporary guitarist, Matt Bair of &quot;The Sequel&quot;. As of July 2011, Eve 6 has reunited with all three original members returning. Their fourth studio album &quot;Speak in Code&quot; was released on April 24, 2012.

In early 2013, Collins began a barrage of songwriting which launched his solo career. With the support of his fans, he fully funded his album &quot;Honey from the Ice Box&quot; in an online campaign through PledgeMusic. On September 6, 2013, the digital version of the album released early for his PledgeMusic supporters. In 2015, he collaborated with Pegboard Nerds, providing vocals for their track &quot;Pink Cloud.&quot;

Collins started a new project with Eve 6 bandmate Ben Hilzinger and Kenny Carkeet of Awolnation called Fitness. In 2020, Collins launched his alter-ego, &quot;Chevy Mustang&quot;, a complex artist/self-styled guru with a Germanic-sounding accent, and a following of students whom he refers to as disciples. Chevy Mustang&#x27;s first single was &quot;Because I Want To&quot; - seemingly in response to the limitations of COVID restrictions. In June 2020, the next Chevy Mustang single, &quot;Can I Be Your Friend&quot; featured Evan Rachel Wood and a version of this song became an electronic birthday card option at JibJab on August 31, 2020.

From April to September 2022, Collins wrote an advice column named &quot;Heart in a Blender&quot; for the Input section of the online magazine Inverse, covering various topics such as mental health, toxic family members, and drug use. As of November 2022, he relaunched the advice column on BuzzFeed News and is also working on a book with the same name that is due out in 2023.

Early 2025 it was announced Collins will be replacing Fountains of Wayne’s deceased bass player Adam Schlesinger on a set of festival shows later in the year. 

==Personal life==
On July 21, 2007, Collins married Victoria Misirli. Collins announced the birth of his daughter Isla (pronounced eye-la) Elizabeth Collins who was born on July 11, 2014. Collins&#x27; second daughter, Zia (pronounced zee-a) Victoria, was born on November 4, 2016. He and Misirli separated in 2019.

He is the nephew of former actor Stephen Collins. His brother was in a band, Controlling the Famous. In December 2020, multiple media outlets took note of the fact that Collins had become a prolific poster to Eve 6&#x27;s official Twitter account, which was &quot;quickly becoming a trove of internet comedy,&quot; including queries to various public figures asking if they &quot;like the heart in a blender song,&quot; &quot;choice tidbits ... about his fellow washed stars,&quot; and &quot;generic observations about wallet chains, weight gain, and merch with palm trees on it, as well as a running bit about not knowing the difference between Vertical Horizon, Dishwalla, Matchbox 20, et al.&quot; Loudwire crowned Collins the &quot;new king of Twitter&quot; and &quot;the anti-Trapt of Twitter,&quot; the latter contrasting Collins&#x27; celebrated output with that of Trapt lead singer Chris Taylor Brown.

==Indecent exposure incident==
On May 26, 2003, Collins was cited for indecent exposure after employees at a Crowne Plaza hotel reported him walking around the hotel naked.

<text>Lawrence Sheriff (or Sheriffe) (c. 1515 or 1516 – September 1567) was a Tudor merchant and benefactor, who was notable for being grocer to Queen Elizabeth I, and for creating Rugby School through an endowment in his will.

Not much is known about Lawrence Sheriff&#x27;s early life, but it is thought that he was born either in a (now long-vanished) house opposite St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Rugby, Warwickshire, or in an extant house in the nearby village of Brownsover. His father was a yeoman farmer, and probably one of the most important people in Rugby at the time. His date of birth is not known with certainty, but is believed to have been either 1515 or 1516. Sheriff likely received a basic education from the monks of Pipewell Abbey, who had a small grange in Rugby at the time. He was apprenticed by his father to a London grocer named William Walcott, at which point he went to London. His seven-year apprenticeship ended in 1541, after which he became a London grocer during the reign of King Henry VIII. In 1554 he was elected to the London livery company the &#x27;Worshipful Company of Grocers&#x27;.

Sheriff became a highly successful grocer to many of the rich and powerful of the day including Princess (later Queen from 1558) Elizabeth. Sheriff provided &quot;spices and necessaries&quot; to Princess Elizabeth when she was living in exile at Hatfield House. Sheriff remained unwaveringly loyal to her during this difficult period, and in 1559 following her accession he was granted a coat of arms produced by Herald&#x27;s College with the Queen&#x27;s approval, the main feature of which is a griffin, the traditional guardian of treasures. In the New Year&#x27;s Gift list for 1562 there is a record of an exchange of gifts between Sheriff and the Queen; he gave her &quot;a sugar loaf, a box of ginger, a box of nutmegs and a pound of cinnamon&quot;, while she in return gave him &quot;one gilt salt with a cover (weighing 7 oz.)&quot;.

He took up residence in a large house called the King&#x27;s Grocer&#x27;s House on Newgate Street in the City of London. Throughout his life he bought extensive property in the areas of Rugby, Brownsover and London, including the estate of Conduit Close in Middlesex.

He became a wealthy merchant, and married a woman called Elizabeth but was not known to have had any children. In 1566 he was elected as the Vice-Warden of the Grocers’ Company, but the following year he became ill and died in September 1567. In his last few months he drew up a will which stipulated that his fortune should be used to found almshouses and a school &quot;to serve chiefly for the children of Rugby and Brownsover... and next for such as be of other places hereunto adjoyneing.&quot;. Shortly before his death, Sheriff added a codicil to his will reducing the amount of money he left to the school, possibly due to a family financial problem, and instead leaving to it his eight-acre Conduit Close estate. At the time,this seemed like a poor exchange, as the estate consisted of undeveloped farmland on the edge of London. However, in time this endowment made Rugby School a wealthy institution due to the subsequent development of the area and rise in land values. The area of the estate includes much of what is now Great Ormond Street, Lamb&#x27;s Conduit Street and Rugby Street in the London district of Bloomsbury. This endowment was not fully realized, however, for some time, due to a challenge over the provisions of the will from the Howkins family, to whom Sheriff was related through his sister, Bridget.

He requested to be buried at parish church of St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Rugby, where his parents were buried, but this request was not carried out, and instead he was buried at Christ Church Greyfriars in Newgate in London. However no trace remains: the church and all its monuments were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. He is remembered today by the Lawrence Sheriff School, the Lawrence Sheriff Almshouses, and Lawrence Sheriff Street in Rugby. Both Rugby School and the Lawrence Sheriff School use versions of the coat of arms granted to Lawrence Sheriff in 1559.

<text>Freezing food preserves it from the time it is prepared to the time it is eaten. Since early times, farmers, fishermen, and trappers have preserved grains and produce in unheated buildings during the winter season. Freezing food slows decomposition by turning residual moisture into ice, inhibiting the growth of most bacterial species. In the food commodity industry, there are two processes: mechanical and cryogenic (or flash freezing). The freezing kinetics is important to preserve the food quality and texture. Quicker freezing generates smaller ice crystals and maintains cellular structure. Cryogenic freezing is the quickest freezing technology available due to the ultra low liquid nitrogen temperature .

Preserving food in domestic kitchens during modern times is achieved using household freezers. Accepted advice to householders was to freeze food on the day of purchase. An initiative by a supermarket group in 2012 (backed by the UK&#x27;s Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme) promotes the freezing of food &quot;as soon as possible up to the product&#x27;s &#x27;use by&#x27; date&quot;. The Food Standards Agency was reported as supporting the change, provided the food had been stored correctly up to that time.

==Preservatives==
Frozen products do not require any added preservatives because microorganisms do not grow when the temperature of the food is below , which is sufficient on its own in preventing food spoilage. Long-term preservation of food may call for food storage at even lower temperatures. Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a tasteless and odorless stabilizer, is typically added to frozen food because it does not adulterate the quality of the product.

==History==

Natural food freezing (using winter frosts) had been in use by people in cold climates for centuries.

In 1861 Thomas Sutcliffe Mort established at Darling Harbour in Sydney, Australia, the world&#x27;s first freezing works, which later became the New South Wales Fresh Food and Ice Company. Mort financed experiments by Eugene Dominic Nicolle, a French born engineer who had arrived in Sydney in 1853 and registered his first ice-making patent in 1861. The first trial shipment of frozen meat to London was in 1868. Although their machinery was never used in the frozen meat trade, Mort and Nicolle developed commercially viable systems for domestic trade. The financial return on that investment was minimal for Mort. Regular shipments of frozen meat from Australia and New Zealand to Europe began in 1881, with a consignment of frozen New Zealand sheep exported to London on board the &quot;Dunedin&quot;.

By 1885 a small number of chickens and geese were being shipped from Russia to London in insulated cases using this technique. By March 1899, the &quot;British Refrigeration and Allied Interests&quot; reported that a food importing business, &quot;Baerselman Bros&quot;, was shipping some 200,000 frozen geese and chickens per week from three Russian depots to New Star Wharf, Lower Shadwell, London over three or four winter months. This trade in frozen food was enabled by the introduction of Linde cold air freezing plants in three Russian depots and the London warehouse. The Shadwell warehouse stored the frozen goods until they were shipped to markets in London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester. The techniques were later expanded to the meat-packing industry.

From 1929, Clarence Birdseye introduced &quot;flash freezing&quot; to the American public. Birdseye first became interested in food freezing during fur-trapping expeditions to Labrador in 1912 and 1916, where he saw the natives use natural freezing to preserve foods. A 1920s hunting trip to Canada, where he witnessed the traditional methods of the indigenous Inuit people, directly inspired Birdseye&#x27;s food preserving method.

The Icelandic Fisheries Commission was created in 1934 to initiate innovation in the industry, and encouraged fishermen to start quick-freezing their catch.
Íshúsfélag Ísfirðinga, one of the first frozen fish companies, was formed in Ísafjörður, Iceland, by a merger in 1937.
More advanced attempts include food frozen for Eleanor Roosevelt on her trip to Russia. Other experiments involving orange juice, ice cream and vegetables were conducted by the military near the end of World War II.

==Technology==

The freezing technique itself, just like the frozen food market, is developing to become faster, more efficient and more cost-effective. As demonstrated by Birdseye&#x27;s work, faster freezing means smaller ice crystals and a better-preserved product.

Birdseye&#x27;s original cryogenic freezing approach using immersion in liquid nitrogen is still used. Due to its cost, however, use is limited to fish fillets, seafood, fruits, and berries. It is also possible to freeze food by immersion in the warmer (at ), but cheaper, liquid carbon dioxide, which can be produced by mechanical freezing (see below).

Most frozen food is instead frozen using a &quot;mechanical&quot; process using the vapor-compression refrigeration technology similar to ordinary freezers. Such a process is cheaper at scale, but is usually slower. (There is also more upfront investment in the form of construction.) Nevertheless, a wide variety of processes have been devised to achieve faster heat transfer from the food to the refrigerant:
* Air-blast freezing is the oldest and cheapest approach. Food is placed into freezing rooms where the air is cold. Air is either forced (&quot;blasted&quot;) onto the food or left static. This setup allows large chunks of food (usually meat or fish) to be more easily processed compared to other methods, but is quite slow.
** Belt freezers simply put a conveyor belt inside a cold room.
** Tunnel freezing is a variant of air-blast freezing where food is put onto trolley racks and sent into a tunnel where cold air is continuously circulated.
** Fluidized bed freezing is a variant of air-blast freezing where pelletized food is blown by fast-moving cold air from below, forming a fluidized bed. The small size of the food combined with the fast-flowing air provides good heat transfer and therefore quicker freezing.
* Contact freezing uses physical contact other than air to transfer the heat. Direct contact freezing puts the product directly in contact with the refrigerant, while indirect contact freezing uses a plate in between.
** Plate freezing is the most common form of contact freezing. Food is put between cold metal plates and then lightly pressed to maintain contact.
** Contact belt freezing combines a conveyor belt with plate freezing. It is usually used for fruit pulps, egg yolk, sauces and soups.
** Immersion freezing dips the product into a cold refrigerant liquid to freeze it, usually on a conveyor belt. The product may be in direct contact with the liquid, or be separated by a membrane. It can be used for freezing the outer shell of large particles to reduce water loss.

Individual Quick Freezing is a descriptive term that includes all forms of freezing that is &quot;individual&quot; (not in a whole block) and &quot;quick&quot; (taking a maximum of several minutes). It may correspond to cryogenic freezing, fluidized bed freezing, or any other technique that meets the definition.

==Packaging==
Frozen food packaging must maintain its integrity throughout filling, sealing, freezing, storage, transportation, thawing, and often cooking. As many frozen foods are cooked in a microwave oven, manufacturers have developed packaging that can go directly from freezer to the microwave.

In 1974, the first differential heating container (DHC) was sold to the public. A DHC is a sleeve of metal designed to allow frozen foods to receive the correct amount of heat. Various sized apertures were positioned around the sleeve. The consumer would put the frozen dinner into the sleeve according to what needed the most heat. This ensured proper cooking.

Today there are multiple options for packaging frozen foods. Boxes, cartons, bags, pouches, Boil-in-Bags, lidded trays and pans, crystallized PET trays, and composite and plastic cans.

Scientists continue to research new aspects of frozen food packaging. Active packaging offers many new technologies that can actively sense and then neutralize the presence of bacteria or other harmful species. Active packaging can extend shelf-life, maintain product safety, and help preserve the food over a longer period of time. Several functions of active packaging are being researched:
* Oxygen scavengers
* Time Temperature Indicators and digital temperature data loggers
* Antimicrobials
* Carbon Dioxide controllers
* Microwave susceptors
* Moisture control: Water activity, Moisture vapor transmission rate, etc.
* Flavor enhancers
* Odor generators
* Oxygen-permeable films
* Oxygen generators

==Effects on nutrients==
The process of flash freezing itself generally effectively retain the nutrient content of foodstuff with minor losses of vitamins, making them a cost-effective and nutritious substitute from fresh equivalents. However, pre-seasoned frozen food, such as packaged meals, may have a significant amounts of salt and fats added. It is therefore recommended to read the nutrition label and the ingredients list.

===Vitamin content of frozen fruits and vegetables===
* Vitamin C: Usually lost in a higher concentration than any other vitamin. A study was performed on peas to determine the cause of vitamin C loss. A vitamin loss of 10% occurred during the blanching phase with the rest of the loss occurring during the cooling and washing stages. The vitamin loss was not actually accredited to the freezing process. Another experiment was performed involving peas and lima beans. Frozen and canned vegetables were both used in the experiment. The frozen vegetables were stored at and the canned vegetables were stored at room temperature . After 0, 3, 6, and 12 months of storage, the vegetables were analyzed with and without cooking. O&#x27;Hara, the scientist performing the experiment said, &quot;From the view point of the vitamin content of the two vegetables when they were ready for the plate of the consumer, there did not appear to be any marked advantages attributable to method of preservation, frozen storage, processed in a tin, or processed in glass.&quot;
* Vitamin B1 (Thiamin): A vitamin loss of 25% is normal. Thiamin is easily soluble in water and is destroyed by heat.
* Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): Not much research has been done to determine how freezing affects Riboflavin levels. Studies that have been performed are inconclusive. One study found an 18% vitamin loss in green vegetables, while another found a 4% loss. It is commonly accepted that the loss of Riboflavin has to do with the preparation for freezing rather than the freezing process itself.
* Vitamin A (Carotene): There is little loss of carotene during preparation for freezing and freezing of most vegetables. Much of the vitamin loss is incurred during the extended storage period.

==Effectiveness==

Freezing is an effective form of food preservation because the pathogens that cause food spoilage are either killed or do not grow very rapidly at reduced temperatures. The process is less effective in food preservation than are thermal techniques, such as boiling, because pathogens are more likely to be able to survive cold temperatures rather than hot temperatures. One of the problems surrounding the use of freezing as a method of food preservation is the danger that pathogens deactivated (but not killed) by the process will once again become active when the frozen food thaws.

Foods may be preserved for several months by freezing. Long-term frozen storage requires a constant temperature of or less.

==Defrosting==
To be used, many cooked foods that have been previously frozen require defrosting prior to consumption. Preferably, some frozen meats should be defrosted prior to cooking to achieve the best outcome: cooked through evenly and of good texture.

The defrost system in freezers helps the equipment to perform properly, without thick layers of ice developing, thus preventing the evaporator coil from absorbing heat and cooling the cabinet.

Ideally, most frozen foods should be defrosted in a refrigerator to avoid significant growth of pathogens. However, this can require considerable time.

Food is often defrosted in one of several ways:
* at room temperature; this is dangerous since the outside may be defrosted while the inside remains frozen
* in a refrigerator
* in a microwave oven
* wrapped in plastic and placed in cold water or under cold running water

People sometimes defrost frozen foods at room temperature because of time constraints or ignorance. Such foods should be promptly consumed after cooking or discarded and never be refrozen or refrigerated since pathogens are not killed by the refreezing process.

==Quality==

The speed of freezing has a direct impact on the size and the number of ice crystals formed within a food product&#x27;s cells and extracellular space. Slow freezing leads to fewer but larger ice crystals while fast freezing leads to smaller but more numerous ice crystals. This difference in ice crystal size can affect the degree of residual enzymatic activity during frozen storage via the process of freeze concentration, which occurs when enzymes and solutes present in a fluid medium are concentrated between ice crystal formations. Increased levels of freeze concentration, mediated by the formation of large ice crystals, can promote enzymatic browning.

Large ice crystals can also puncture the walls of the cells of the food product which will cause a degradation of the texture of the product as well as the loss of its natural juices during thawing. That is why there will be a qualitative difference observed between food products frozen by ventilated mechanical freezing, non-ventilated mechanical freezing or cryogenic freezing with liquid nitrogen.

==Reaction==
According to a 2007 study, an American consumes frozen food on average 71 times a year, most of which are pre-cooked frozen meals.

<text>A tomahawk is a type of single-handed axe used by the many Indian peoples and nations of North America. It traditionally resembles a hatchet with a straight shaft. In pre-colonial times the head was made of stone, bone, or antler, and European settlers later introduced heads of iron and steel. The term came into the English language in the 17th century as an adaptation of the Powhatan (Virginian Algonquian) word.

Tomahawks were general-purpose tools used by Native Americans and later the European colonials with whom they traded, and often employed as a hand-to-hand weapon. The metal tomahawk heads were originally based on a Royal Navy boarding axe (a lightweight hand axe designed to cut through boarding nets when boarding hostile ships) and used as a trade-item with Native Americans for food and other provisions.

==Etymology==
The name comes from Powhatan , derived from the Proto-Algonquian root &#x27;to cut off by tool&#x27;. Algonquian cognates include Lenape , Malecite-Passamaquoddy , and Abenaki , all of which mean &#x27;axe&#x27;.

==History==

The Algonquian people created the tomahawk. Before Europeans came to the continent, Native Americans would use stones, sharpened by a process of knapping and pecking, attached to wooden handles, secured with strips of rawhide. The tomahawk quickly spread from the Algonquian culture to the tribes of the South and the Great Plains.

Native Americans created a &quot;tomahawk’s poll&quot;, the side opposite the blade, which consisted of a hammer, spike or pipe. These became known as pipe tomahawks, which consisted of a bowl on the poll and a hollowed out shaft. These were created by European and American artisans for trade and diplomatic gifts for the tribes.

==Composition==

The tomahawk&#x27;s original designs were fitted with heads of bladed or rounded stone or deer antler.
According to Mike Haskew, the modern tomahawk shaft is usually less than in length, traditionally made of hickory, ash, or maple. The heads weigh anywhere from , with a cutting edge usually not much longer than from toe to heel. The poll can feature a hammer, spike, or may simply be rounded off, and they usually do not have lugs. From the 1800s onward, these sometimes had a pipe-bowl carved into the poll, and a hole drilled down the center of the shaft for smoking tobacco through the metal head. Pipe tomahawks are artifacts unique to North America, created by Europeans as trade objects but often exchanged as diplomatic gifts. They were symbols of the choice Europeans and Native Americans faced whenever they met: one end was the pipe of peace, the other an axe of war.

In colonial French territory, a different tomahawk design, closer to the ancient European francisca, was in use by French settlers and local peoples. In the late 18th century, the British Army issued tomahawks to their colonial regulars during the American Revolutionary War as a weapon and tool.

==Modern use==
Tomahawks are useful in camping and bushcraft scenarios. They are mostly used as an alternative to a hatchet, as they are generally lighter and slimmer than hatchets. They often contain other tools in addition to the axe head, such as spikes or hammers.
Modern, non-traditional tomahawks were used by selected units of the US armed forces during the Vietnam War and are referred to as &quot;Vietnam tomahawks&quot; to inflict injury. These modern tomahawks have gained popularity with their reemergence by American Tomahawk Company in the beginning of 2001 and a collaboration with custom knife-maker Ernest Emerson of Emerson Knives, Inc. A similar wood handle Vietnam tomahawk is produced today by Cold Steel.

Many of these modern tomahawks are made of drop forged, differentially heat treated, alloy steel. The differential heat treatment allows for the chopping portion and the spike to be harder than the middle section, allowing for a shock-resistant body with a durable temper.

===Tomahawk throwing competitions===

Tomahawk throwing is a popular sport among American and Canadian historical reenactment groups, and new martial arts such as Okichitaw have begun to revive tomahawk fighting techniques used during the colonial era. Tomahawks are a category within competitive knife throwing. Today&#x27;s hand-forged tomahawks are being made by master craftsmen throughout the United States.

Today, there are many events that host tomahawk throwing competitions.

The tomahawk competitions have regulations concerning the type and style of tomahawk used for throwing. There are special throwing tomahawks made for these kinds of competitions. Requirements such as a minimum handle length and a maximum blade edge (usually ) are the most common tomahawk throwing competition rules.

===Military application===

Tomahawks were used by individual members of the US Army Stryker Brigade in Afghanistan, the 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team based at Grafenwöhr (Germany), the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division out of Fort Lewis, a reconnaissance platoon in the 2d Squadron 183d Cavalry (116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team) (OIF 2007–2008) and numerous other soldiers. The tomahawk was issued a NATO stock number (4210-01-518-7244) and classified as a &quot;Class 9 rescue kit&quot; as a result of a program called the Rapid Fielding Initiative; it is also included within every Stryker vehicle as the &quot;modular entry tool set&quot;. This design enjoyed something of a renaissance with US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan as a tool and in use in hand-to-hand combat.

===Law enforcement===
The tomahawk has gained some respect from members of various law enforcement tactical (i.e. &quot;SWAT&quot;) teams. Some companies have seized upon this new popularity and are producing &quot;tactical tomahawks&quot;. These SWAT-oriented tools are designed to be both useful and relatively light. Some examples of &quot;tactical tomahawks&quot; include models wherein the shaft is designed as a Pry Bar.

===Modern tomahawk fighting===
There are not many systems worldwide which teach fighting skills with the axe or a tomahawk to civilians.

In the 20th and 21st century, tomahawks have been prominently featured in films and video games (e.g. &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;; &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot;; &quot;The Patriot&quot;; &quot;Jonah Hex&quot;; &quot;Prey&quot;; &quot;Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter&quot;; &quot;Bullet to the Head&quot;; &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot; and its sequel, and &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot;), leading to increased interest among the public. Tomahawks are among the weapons used in the Filipino martial art escrima.
